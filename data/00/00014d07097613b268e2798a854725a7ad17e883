<p>Readers may recall that last year, <a class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/04/cancellation-of-neh-grants-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many NEH grants were cancelled</a> by Donald Trump’s administration. Most of those were reinstated following court rulings that blocked the administrations blanket cancellations.</p>
<p>In this current round of grants, the NEH distributed $75.1 million to 84 humanities projects. This is a significant increase in total funds over previous rounds of grants.</p>
<p>Whether there has been a shift in the kinds of projects funded is something I have not looked into in detail, but from a cursory look of the lot of them, there does seem to be an increase in projects about religion and projects about American history, political documents, and ideals. You can view the complete list of grants <a href="https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/2026-01/January%202026%20NEH%20grants%20state%20by%20state.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2026/01/21/philosophy-professors-among-recent-neh-grant-winners/">Philosophy Professors Among Recent NEH Grant Winners</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
