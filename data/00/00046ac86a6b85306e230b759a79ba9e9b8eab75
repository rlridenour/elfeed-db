<p>President Trump spoke by phone last week with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, in a conversation that included talk of a possible in‑person meeting in the United States, according to multiple accounts cited by The New York Times and other outlets. The call took place as Washington steps up military and diplomatic pressure on Caracas, including a large US deployment in the Caribbean and recent strikes on boats suspected of carrying drugs. Days after the conversation, the US move to formally designate Maduro as leading what it calls a foreign terrorist organization, the Cartel de los Soles, went into effect, underscoring the tension surrounding any potential dialogue. No date or venue has been scheduled and officials say there are currently no concrete plans for the two leaders to meet, but the outreach suggests Washington is pairing threats with openings for negotiation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7bfXxEMGe4q9wxymU-1FxUPBeL76lmSiGk7thH2xRpB_km3aqr5UPxJKuMAXH-uUweYPCqUXVcu9JQNw-PNomt1Agj0t8Td8ORBYP5kpbDYCy7vQLJ1pITiuG3W2LFCWgbvrNYOaoRoAeB5M7_a7exzgM4bHQIdWwibMPA_u13qCXwAcioQ' alt='Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who faces rising US military and diplomatic pressure, reportedly spoke by phone with President Trump about a possible future meeting.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Military posture: US forces, including what has been described as the world’s largest aircraft carrier, have been deployed in the Caribbean with the stated goal of countering drug trafficking near Venezuela’s coast.</li><li>Drug-trafficking focus: Since September, US operations have destroyed more than 20 vessels in international Caribbean waters that American authorities describe as drug‑smuggling boats linked to regional narcotics flows.</li><li>Terrorist-group designation: The US State Department’s designation of the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization, which Washington alleges Maduro leads, came into force just days after the leaders’ phone call.</li><li>Venezuelan military response: Maduro has ordered Venezuela’s armed forces to remain on high alert and conduct drills in response to US actions near the country’s borders.</li><li>Regional concern: Colombian President Gustavo Petro has criticized recent US strikes on boats in the area, stating that some of those killed were Colombian fishermen, highlighting worries about spillover effects on neighboring countries.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US administration: People familiar with the call told US media that the outreach fits a broader strategy in which Washington combines pressure, including sanctions and military presence, with occasional direct contacts to test whether Maduro is willing to negotiate on security and political issues.
