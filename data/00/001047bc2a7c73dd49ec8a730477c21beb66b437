<li>Finally, a way to make hummus during a power outage</li>
<li>Two little things that chop veggies at the pull of a cord</li>
<li>Surprisingly expensive elsewhere</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: Yeah, a real chunky one!</li>
</ul><h1>Trust The Process</h1><p>Enemies of produce, rejoice! It’s March! The new season of <em>Top Chef</em> just kicked off on Bravo, and Food Network’s <em>Tournament of Champions</em> is in full swing!</p>
<p>Not to mention, there remains a massive backlog of old episodes of <em>Iron Chef</em>, <em>Chopped</em>, <em>Guy’s Grocery Games</em>, and any number of other timed cooking competition shows to fall back on.</p>
<p>What does all this mean?</p>
<p>At any given time you can fill your television screen with someone frantically eviscerating onions, garlic cloves, tomatoes, carrots, celery, cauliflower, and all other manner of vegetables.</p>
<p>Why, it can be downright inspiring to see, can’t it? It might even make you think that you should dust off the old Santoku and make a little fresh pico for Taco Tuesday next week.</p>
<p>The only problem?</p>
<p>This…</p>

<p>…is not you.</p>
<p>Which means chopping up some onions, some garlic, a tomato, some cilantro, and a jalapeño will take roughly as long as it takes one of these pros to turn out a surprisingly composed meal, and by the end, tears will be running down your cheeks from all the syn-propanethial-S-oxide you released, not to mention the whisper of oncoming carpel tunnel emanating from your dominant wrist.</p>
<p>Unless you use these.</p>
<p>What are they? Basically: pull-cord food processors. You load stuff into one, you seal the lid, you give it the old start-the-lawnmower tug, and viola! It chops.</p>
<p>Now, usually, when you put something raw like onions into a food processor, you end up with bitter, wet, onion-scented mush. Will you avoid that with these because they don’t have a big powerful engine spinning their blades?</p>
<p>Probably somewhat, is our honest hypothesis. But do tell us if we’re wrong.</p>
<p>No, they’re not as good as an expertly applied knife, but yes, they’re a little easier, and also they’re cute and fun.</p>
<p>What’s more: similar products are shockingly expensive elsewhere.</p>
<p>So get a couple and get chopping.</p>
