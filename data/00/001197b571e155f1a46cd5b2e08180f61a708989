watchOS 11.4 can be downloaded on a connected <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> by opening up the Apple Watch app and going to General &gt; Software Update. To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery and it needs to be placed on a charger.<br/>
<br/>
With watchOS 11.4, Apple has added an option for a Sleep Wake Up alarm to break through Silent Mode, so you can have your Apple Watch make a sound in addition to haptic tapping when a morning alarm goes off. There's also support for Matter-compatible robot vacuum cleaners in the Home app.<br/>
<blockquote>This update includes new features, improvements, and bug fixes, including:<br/>
- Matter-compatible robot vacuum cleaners can be added to the Home app as well as used in scenes, automations, or simply say "Siri, clean the living room."<br/>
- An option to allow Sleep Wake Up alarm to break through Silent Mode<br/>
- An issue where face selection may become unresponsive when switching faces<br/>
