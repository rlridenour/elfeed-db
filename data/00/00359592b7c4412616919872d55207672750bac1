iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air pre-orders <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/12/iphone-17-preorders-launch/">began at 5 a.m. Pacific Time</a> in the U.S. and many other countries today.

As of shortly after 6 a.m. Pacific Time today, nearly all iPhone 17 Pro Max configurations on Apple's online store in the U.S. are facing an additional 1-3 week shipping delay beyond the Friday, September 19 launch day. This means that some configurations are now expected to be delivered in mid-October. However, for a few configurations, in-store pickup on launch day is still an option at select Apple Store locations.<br/>
<br/>
The all-new, ultra-thin iPhone Air is faring much better, with most configurations still available for September 19 delivery as of the time of writing.<br/>
<br/>
The smaller iPhone 17 Pro and the standard iPhone 17 are also not facing considerable delays.<br/>
<br/>
Inventory will likely continue to tighten for both delivery and Apple Store pickup as the day progresses, so order quickly if you are planning to.<br/>
