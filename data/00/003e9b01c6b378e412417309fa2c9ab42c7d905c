<li>A shaker, a stirrer, a strainer, some stoppers, some pourers, a whole bunch of stuff</li>
<li>A cocktail recipe book, too</li>
<li>It looks pretty cool</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: Friend, do we have some delightful news for you!</li>
</ul><h1>Cockt-sale</h1><p>Can I let you in on a fun coincidence?</p>
<p>I am just now sitting down to get a little work done after taking a trip to a nearby store that sells spices, fancy vinegars, and other such artisanal culinary products. Why? Because it was the one place in my area where I could find orange blossom water, which I need to make my own homemade orgeat syrup so I can finally begin mixing my way through <em>Beachbum Berry’s Grog Log</em>.</p>
<p>And what do I find as my assignment for the day?</p>
<p>A mixology kit.</p>
<p>Seriously, <a href="/@troy">@troy</a>, are you reading my diary?</p>
<p>We went over what makes cocktails such a fun drink option on another sale for a different shaker, but here’s a quick rundown:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes, it requires more effort than cracking open a can or popping a cork, but it’s also more satisfying;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your ratios are in your hands, so if you want to dial down the booze or dial up the citrus, you can; and…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you make more cocktails, you learn more about the art of mixology, which means you can start to make your own recipes and mix up your own concoctions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But, as shown by the above anecdote about making orgeat syrup from scratch, what I’ve actually been enjoying the most about my adventures in cocktailing is the cooking side.</p>
<p>If you want to buy a bottle of tequila and some margarita mix, go for it! All the more power to you!</p>
<p>But it can also be fun to mess around with making some of your own mixes, or doing some fruit infusions, or hell, even making your own banana liquor (which is something I’m considering, because a few of Berry’s recipes call for it, and I can’t stand artificial banana flavor).</p>
<p>What’s neat about this mixology set is that it allows for either approach. Want to mix together some booze and a pre-made mixer? You’ve got everything you need for that. But it also comes with stoppers and pourers if you decide to start whipping up cocktail components yourself.</p>
<p>Also, it looks very cool, and it comes with a recipe book.</p>
<p>In conclusion: get this cocktail kit and make a few cocktails.</p>
