<p>We are not our mistakes. The thing that defines us is what we do <em>after</em> we realise we’ve blundered. No matter what we’ve done, how foolish or mean or stupid or ugly or lazy we’ve been, there are <em>always</em> as many new beginnings available to us. As many as we need.</p>
<p>The important thing is not the mistakes, but the direction we’re trying to face despite them.</p>
