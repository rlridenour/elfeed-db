Astropad today announced the launch of <a href="http://astropad.com/freshcoat">Fresh Coat</a>, a new anti-reflective screen protector that's designed to make the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> easier to see outdoors and under bright lights.<br/>

Fresh Coat is a glass screen protector that cuts down on up to 75 percent of reflections while preserving color accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
We were able to try out Fresh Coat ahead of launch, and can confirm that it does indeed cut down on reflections without impacting the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s color or display visibility, with no sign of haze. Astropad includes a tray that ensures a precise alignment and makes applying the screen protector foolproof, and it comes with an app clip that walks you through the installation process.<br/>
<br/>
Astropad uses a five-layer system for Fresh Coat, including a flexible bonding layer to cushion drops, a dust barrier to protect from debris, "armorine" tempered glass for screen protection, an oleophobic and hydrophobic coating, and finally, the anti-reflective coating. The entire package is 0.6mm thick.<br/>

The same type of anti-reflective technology is rumored to be coming to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models, and now the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro can get it too. Fresh Coat will also benefit the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models, providing extra reflection reduction. In fact, Astropad says that standard screen protectors will cancel out Apple's antireflective coating, but Fresh Coat will preserve it.<br/>
