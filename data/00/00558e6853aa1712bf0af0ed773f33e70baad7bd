I&rsquo;m a long term user of <a href="https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump">Dumb Jump</a>. According to <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8307">this Irreal post</a>, I&rsquo;ve been a devoted fan since 2017. As I&rsquo;ve said many times in my several posts about Dumb Jump—search for &ldquo;dumb jump&rdquo; on Irreal if you&rsquo;re interested—I&rsquo;ve never been able to warm up to TAGS systems because they require so much maintenance and LSP systems have always seemed like too much work for what I want them for.

It turns out that I&rsquo;m not the only fan. Ruslan Bekenev has a <a href="https://codelearn.me/2026/01/03/dumb-jump-is-so-good.html">lovely paean to Dumb Jump</a>. He, like me, says it has completely eliminated his need for TAGS or LSP. For all the things that I use it for it&rsquo;s instantaneous. That can be difficult to believe when you learn how it works but it&rsquo;s true. You can get the details from Bekenev&rsquo;s post or the Dumb Jump site but the TL;DR is that it uses grep to search for the desired target. I use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> with it so it&rsquo;s fast with even big repositories. Bekenev has an animated GIF showing how it works for him.

If you haven&rsquo;t tried Dumb Jump, I join with Bekenev in urging you to try it out. It&rsquo;s small, doesn&rsquo;t require a complicated installation and is easy to configure. If you don&rsquo;t like it, you can simply delete the package and remove it from your <code>init.el</code>.</p>
