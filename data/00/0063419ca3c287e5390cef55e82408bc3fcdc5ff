Eligible customers can split purchases into three monthly installments, or choose to pay up to 30 days later, without paying any interest. For higher-value purchases with longer payment plans, Klarna says it offers competitive interest rates.<br/>

Klarna was already available via Apple Pay in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Spain, and Sweden, so there are now eight countries supported.<br/>

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-discontinuing-apple-pay-later/">discontinued</a> its own buy-now, pay-later service called Apple Pay Later last year, and instead started partnering with third-party providers, including Klarna, Affirm, and Synchrony. Availability of these providers varies by country.<br/>

When checking out with Apple Pay online and in apps, iPhone and iPad users can select "Other Cards & Pay Later Options" to access installment payment plans from Klarna and other financing partners, where available.
