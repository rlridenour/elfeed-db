If you follow the various Emacs forums, you&rsquo;ll see a lot a whining about how hard Elisp is to learn and how things would be so much better if only the extension language were something rational like Python, Ruby, or Lua. I rail frequently against this nonsense but Prot (Protesilaos Stavrou) stands as an unassailable refutation of the silliness.
</p>
<p>
He&rsquo;s a guy with a liberal arts education who has no training in programming and yet has nevertheless produced some really great Emacs software. If you look at his code, you can see that he&rsquo;s obviously mastered the intricacies of Elisp.
</p>
<p>
Now, Prot has shared some of his knowledge in the form of a <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/emacs-lisp-elements">short Elisp tutorial</a>. Although Emacs is exhaustively documented, there&rsquo;s a dearth of Elisp documentation for beginners. There is, of course, the Elisp manual, which is comprehensive, but not really beginner friendly. It&rsquo;s a reference rather than a tutorial.
</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s the builtin Elisp tutorial and Mbork&rsquo;s <a href="https://mbork.pl/2022-01-03_The_Emacs_Lisp_book_-_looking_back_and_into_the_future">Elisp book</a> but not much more. I am, therefore, happy to see Prot&rsquo;s contribution. I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to do more than scan it but it seems like a very worthwhile addition to the Emacs corpus.
</p>
<p>
One thing for sure, it should put all the whiners to shame. If you&rsquo;re claiming to be a software engineer but find Elisp too difficult to learn, you should be chagrined that a guy with no formal training in software is nevertheless able to produce first rate Elisp code that the Emacs community embraces as useful and excellent.
</p>
<p>
The irony is that Lisps in general are actually easier to learn and use than other languages. It&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re unfamiliar to n00bs so they seem unapproachable. If you just suspend your expectations from other languages, you&rsquo;ll find that Elisp is actually an easy language to learn.
