<p>I have mixed feelings about stuff like <a href="https://www.resistandunsubscribe.com/.">www.resistandunsubscribe.com/.</a></p>
<p>Of course I agree with the sentiment.</p>
<p>But for folks out there, saying something like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easy! Simply change how you buy stuff, get rid of your credit cards, get used to finding alternatives for transportation, entertainment, and how you talk to your family and friends! That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; it&rsquo;s just not gonna work. Not to mention many workplaces for Microsoft, Google, or Apple.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the solution is, maybe for folks to try and see how <em>hard</em> it is to change their ways and how dependent they are on all these things would do it, but I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
