<p><strong>Location:</strong> The California Theatre, San Jose <br />
<strong>Showtime:</strong> Tuesday, 10 June 2025, 7pm PT (Doors open 6pm) <br />
<strong>Special Guest(s):</strong> Definitely, but keep in mind <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/29/the-talk-show-live-tickets-2025">what I announced last week</a> <br />
<strong>Price:</strong> $50</p>

<p>I’ll have more to announce about the show soon, but one week out, I just want to remind everyone that tickets are on sale now, and selling at about the same pace as the last two years. (In 2018 and 2019, when WWDC was a real in-person conference in San Jose, tickets sold out almost instantaneously.)</p>

<p>Also: at least one sponsorship slot is still available. If you’ve got a product or service you’d like to see me promote at the start of the show, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/contact/">shoot me an email</a>.</p>
