  <p>I really thought that the screen recording notifications in macOS
Sequoia would be the bane of my existence, but thankfully those
have been changed quite a bit from the early betas last summer and
they’re totally a non-issue in my book today. However, these god
damned “turn on reactions” alerts have got to die in a fire, and
they need to have done it yesterday.</p>

<p>I understand why Apple decided to show this once. Why though, is it seemingly designed to reappear every time I start a video call? Who is <em>not</em> annoyed by this?</p>
