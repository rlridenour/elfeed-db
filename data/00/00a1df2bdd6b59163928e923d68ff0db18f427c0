<p>British playwright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard, whose witty, intellectually playful works reshaped modern theatre and earned him an Academy Award for the screenplay of the 1998 film &quot;Shakespeare in Love,&quot; has died at the age of 88 at his home in Dorset, southern England, surrounded by his family. His talent agency United Agents announced his death and said he would be remembered for the brilliance and humanity of his writing, as well as his wit, irreverence, generosity of spirit and deep love of the English language. Born in Czechoslovakia and later becoming a leading figure of British theatre, Stoppard wrote across six decades, from early breakthroughs like &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; to recent successes such as the Tony-winning &quot;Leopoldstadt&quot;. His work also reached wide popular audiences through contributions to major film franchises including &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and &quot;Star Wars,&quot; introducing his blend of humor and ideas to millions beyond the stage.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/yrlO9_WiGYzjG7ojrhabp-CyvJLi_nEBb9BEPu0A9Fge_lfT9hBO-hRN_JqevH0ibJ73gz33GWD0ykAyUnEutyjQ9pvlhxyp58d9QwfGPTmQJJC60BO67p0Tk1biBO9jleKcLDge7tfKZDoTGrnbV0bWQmIjjTK1CGMBAbFInstKCUnVZbbOmpexf9fc0Pm75TkAKq0Xx8e8ZXG4-bl7ddPT4au316OHVUfcdrY_h2FGnqJHjjEjjKl2_7rlDP9gbbUPjksg6v6yZixtZg' alt='Tom Stoppard pictured in London in 2012 during the world premiere of &quot;Anna Karenina.&quot;' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Signature style: Stoppard’s writing, often blending philosophy, science and comedy, became so distinctive that critics coined the adjective &quot;Stoppardian&quot; to describe works with similar sparkling, idea-driven dialogue.</li><li>Notable plays: Across his career he created acclaimed stage works including &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,&quot; &quot;Arcadia,&quot; &quot;The Real Thing&quot; and &quot;Leopoldstadt,&quot; each exploring themes from love and identity to history and mathematics.</li><li>Film achievements: In addition to his Oscar-winning work on &quot;Shakespeare in Love,&quot; Stoppard contributed to the scripts of high-profile movies such as entries in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, broadening his influence well beyond the theatre world.</li><li>Exploring heritage: His final play &quot;Leopoldstadt&quot; drew on his own family history as Czech-born and Jewish, dramatizing the persecution his relatives faced during the Holocaust and later winning the Tony Award for best play in 2023.</li><li>Global tributes: Following news of his death, writers, performers and cultural institutions across the world publicly celebrated his artistic innovation and the transformative impact of his work on modern drama.</li></ul><blockquote>He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language. - United Agents (statement on behalf of Tom Stoppard’s representatives)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United Agents: The talent agency described Stoppard as a beloved client and friend who died peacefully at home in Dorset with his family, and highlighted his generosity, irreverence and love of language as defining personal qualities alongside his artistic achievements.
