<p id="p2">When <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/gemini-2-0-and-llms-integrated-with-apps/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I last wrote</a> about <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-gemini/id6477489729" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini for iOS</a>, I noted the app&rsquo;s lackluster integration with several system features. But since &ndash; unlike <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/viticci.macstories.net/post/3ljgbcf53d22m" rel="noopener noreferrer">others in the AI space</a> &ndash; the team at Google is actually shipping new stuff on a weekly basis, I&rsquo;m not too surprised to see that the latest version of Gemini for iOS has brought extensive support for widgets.</p>
<p id="p3">Specifically, Gemini for iOS now offers a collection of Lock Screen widgets that also appear as controls in iOS 18&rsquo;s Control Center, and there are barebones Shortcuts actions to go along with them. In both the Lock Screen&rsquo;s widget gallery and Control Center, you&rsquo;ll find Gemini widgets to:</p>
<ul id="ul4"><li>type a prompt,</li>
<li>Talk Live,</li>
<li>open the microphone (for dictation),</li>
<li>open the camera,</li>
<li>share an image (with a Photos picker), and</li>
<li>share a document (with a Files picker).</li>
</ul><p id="p5">It&rsquo;s nice to see these integrations with Photos and Files; notably, Gemini now also has a share extension that lets you add the same media types &ndash; plus URLs from webpages &ndash; to a prompt from anywhere on iOS.</p>
<p id="p6">The Shortcuts integration is a little less exciting since Google implemented old-school actions that do <em>not</em> support customizable parameters. Instead, Gemini only offers actions to open the app in three modes: type, dictate, or Talk Live. That&rsquo;s disappointing, and I would have preferred to see the ability to pass text or images from Shortcuts directly to Gemini.</p>
<p id="p7">While today&rsquo;s updates are welcome, Google still has plenty of work left to do on Apple&rsquo;s platforms. For starters, they don&rsquo;t have an iPad version of the Gemini app. There are no Home Screen widgets yet. And the Shortcuts integration, as we&rsquo;ve seen, could go much deeper. Still, the inclusion of controls, basic Shortcuts actions, and a share extension goes a long way toward making Gemini easier to access on iOS &ndash; that is, until the entire assistant is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/22/apple-intelligence-google-gemini-soon/" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrated as an extension for Apple Intelligence</a>.</p>
