<p>President Trump announced that South Africa will not be invited to the 2026 G20 leaders’ summit in Miami, Florida, and that the US will halt payments and subsidies to the country, sharply escalating a diplomatic dispute between Washington and Pretoria. He linked the decision to two issues: South Africa’s refusal to hand over the G20 presidency’s ceremonial gavel to a US embassy representative at the close of this year’s Johannesburg summit, and his longstanding claims that South Africa fails to address violent abuses against white farmers and Afrikaners. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called the move “regrettable” and based on misinformation, stressing that Pretoria rejected Washington’s attempt to alter normal G20 protocol after the US chose to boycott the Johannesburg meeting. The dispute comes just after South Africa successfully hosted the first G20 on African soil, where leaders adopted a declaration emphasizing climate action, debt relief for poorer nations and efforts to reduce global inequality.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/AYjL3GAMglsM2X_XrHPIYypdelxGT7nPlv--rMmaHolXxfFnG1IhUmN_88Ja8yYsHrdLgA6bQckrgyRP-bXtcKxdKX4o8pFz8Bjt0FCZ0Zkbd59GATtrSBvwRoyz47M1_EMORWJiFbLlABhA-kFMgaBFzFi4FmdMQ0m3pI9oKMNlkzrWQwYd18fZUJ9BWaCBqTKt_UgQW0fuxJaqI1yfbGjP' alt='South African President Cyril Ramaphosa addressing leaders at the G20 summit in Johannesburg.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>US boycott context: The US government did not send an official delegation to the G20 leaders’ summit in Johannesburg, with President Trump saying he skipped the meeting because he believed white Afrikaners in South Africa were being violently persecuted.</li><li>Dispute over gavel: At the end of the Johannesburg summit, South Africa declined a US proposal for an embassy representative to receive the traditional G20 gavel handover, viewing it as a breach of protocol since the president of the next host country normally accepts it in person.</li><li>Miami summit venue: The 2026 G20 summit is scheduled to take place at Trump National Doral Miami, a golf resort in Florida owned by President Trump, marking a rare instance of a sitting G20 chair hosting the gathering at a personally owned property.</li><li>South Africa’s G20 priorities: During its G20 presidency, South Africa pushed themes such as climate cooperation, debt relief for low-income states, and tackling global inequality, which Washington officials said ran counter to the current US administration’s policy priorities.</li><li>Refugee status for some farmers: The Trump administration has previously granted refugee status to dozens of white South Africans who alleged persecution in their home country, reflecting the White House’s focus on claims of abuses against Afrikaner farmers.</li></ul><blockquote>South Africa has demonstrated to the World they are not a country worthy of Membership anywhere - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US government: President Trump argued that South Africa should be excluded from the Miami summit and lose US payments because, in his view, it mistreated a US embassy representative at the Johannesburg meeting and failed to address what he described as horrific abuses of white farmers and Afrikaners.
