<p>A U.S. magistrate judge, William Fitzpatrick, said there is evidence of “profound” investigative errors in the federal case against former FBI director James Comey and ordered grand jury materials be turned over to Comey’s lawyers, saying the record gives &#x27;a reasonable basis&#x27; to question whether government misconduct occurred. The judge singled out the federal prosecutor who led the investigation, Lindsey Halligan — a Trump-appointed attorney whom reports say had not previously worked as a prosecutor — as having possibly made significant legal errors in presenting evidence and instructing the grand jury. The ruling raises fresh legal challenges to the indictment brought after President Trump publicly called for Comey’s prosecution.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/j59WGs7CZACmwbftrybtUfvvXzs3Ow6VTEhSFpIGXlO3Jb-0SZmM_WmbQOHEmreyLnUYliHIdRDTbhjPHNLY0AHbhn3U-n9M2YA5x850w11wpT64ZK7ubQNWFXmnEGw8NBtiADBoIANoi9M79kBb-Amp7zD6P6u9k38jRS2lMGjPN0_L3NBmlJOVPv_uI2sWIB8t2IPorQ7T4QCUlEAgjB5uR5qUnQDiXyJSIsWCKDcN1lf7uXDIWZ9HsWl2P9-T5h9nLAk3tuInPhzCQg' alt='Former FBI director James Comey, left, with his attorney David Kelley speaking to reporters after congressional testimony in 2018.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Judge’s language: Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick wrote that there was &#x27;a reasonable basis&#x27; to question whether &#x27;government misconduct&#x27; occurred, describing the handling of the case as a &#x27;disturbing pattern&#x27;.</li><li>Prosecutor background: The lead prosecutor in the case, Lindsey Halligan, was appointed by President Trump and, according to reporting, had not previously served as a criminal prosecutor, a fact the judge flagged when assessing how evidence was presented to the grand jury.</li><li>Grand jury access: The judge ordered grand jury materials to be provided to Comey’s defense team, a step that gives lawyers access to the evidence and instructions presented to jurors and could allow them to test whether the grand jury process was tainted.</li></ul><blockquote>A reasonable basis to question whether &#x27;government misconduct&#x27; occurred - U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick: The record gives &#x27;a reasonable basis&#x27; to question whether government misconduct occurred in the presentation of the case to the grand jury, and there is a &#x27;disturbing pattern&#x27; in how the matter was handled.
