<p>Now I have set <code>(pixel-scroll-precision-mode 1)</code> which comes with emacs 29 this has led to an unexpected issue in that I now often get the following messages which cause a bell sound to be generated each time:</p>
<figure class="emacs-img"><img src="https://emacs.dyerdwelling.family/ox-hugo/20230817170149-emacs--No-Bell-For-Me.jpg">
</figure>

<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">pixel-scroll-precision-scroll-up-page: Beginning of buffer [22 times]
pixel-scroll-precision-scroll-down-page: End of buffer [54 times]
</code></pre><p>I had turned to <code>(setq visible-bell t)</code> in the past but this generates an annoying flash each time rather than an annoying bell sound.</p>
<p>There is a solution to this of course and that is <code>(setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)</code> in that we are silent when a visual bell is rung, ah pure bliss 🙂🔔</p>
