<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has instructed his foreign minister to prepare for &quot;fair and equitable&quot; negotiations with the United States over Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, on the condition that talks occur in an atmosphere free of threats and what Tehran calls unreasonable demands. Diplomats from both sides are expected to head to Turkey later this week, with reporting pointing to a likely meeting in Istanbul on Friday involving Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US envoy Steve Witkoff, though initial contacts may be indirect. The diplomatic push follows weeks of anti-government protests in Iran and heightened regional tensions, including President Trump’s decision to dispatch an aircraft carrier group and publicly warn that &quot;bad things&quot; could happen if no agreement is reached on Iran’s nuclear activities. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes and says any deal must respect its national interests and be conducted with dignity and prudence, even as it vows a strong response to any military attack.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gD_Nq6K0MywijPY9CdJhRinVuJSQ5N-j60MWU9K1OMtLtFAxdGrM8cuvsxSAIwVkjsoRe0CKo341_KCVRQf3MvyjFH2_atg2MX2QSfTpWsT6YtnywI_8Ffkx1sTQFe-OQB61v4mFL_6xvY2htH0YJbs_Asrod5gWA-1HcnHI8F_v7DiDI-lTmZLtLL_kiEortv9mFnZva4tbZTJWckitNuV-y_tOFlMgmNNRENtFiqPOSpJKuSXQFM1Fa8gJiE_LlD_Csc-eKimA57Cs9w' alt='Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian at the United Nations General Assembly in 2025, now calling for &quot;fair and equitable&quot; talks with the United States.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Mediation efforts: Officials and media reports credit diplomatic interventions by Turkey, Egypt, Qatar and Oman with helping arrange the prospective talks in Turkey and reduce the likelihood of a US military strike.</li><li>Format of negotiations: Senior adviser Ali Shamkhani said any dialogue with Washington will begin indirectly through intermediaries and only move to face-to-face talks if progress toward a deal becomes realistic.</li><li>US military posture: The United States has deployed an aircraft carrier group, described as an &#x27;armada&#x27; led by the USS Abraham Lincoln, to the Middle East while insisting that any agreement must curb uranium enrichment and Iran’s ballistic missile program.</li><li>Iranian domestic backdrop: Pezeshkian’s move toward negotiations comes after he previously warned that recent turmoil and protests inside Iran had gone beyond his control, underscoring internal pressure for de-escalation and stability.</li><li>Gulf states’ stance: A United Arab Emirates official said Tehran needs to &#x27;rebuild&#x27; its relationship with Washington, signaling that some regional governments see renewed US–Iran dialogue as important for broader Middle East stability.</li></ul><blockquote>I have instructed my minister of foreign affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists – one free from threats and unreasonable expectations – to pursue fair and equitable negotiations, guided by the principles of dignity, prudence, and expediency. - Masoud Pezeshkian</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Iran: President Pezeshkian says Iran will pursue talks only if they are conducted without threats or excessive demands and strictly within the framework of Iran’s national interests and dignity.
