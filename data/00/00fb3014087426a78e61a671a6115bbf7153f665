<p>Tariffs! Are they off? Are they on? Are they halved, doubled, super-tricksy inside outified? Nobody really knows.</p>
<p>While my colleague Jason Snell already <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2661902/how-apple-can-handle-trumps-tariffs-without-raising-prices-too-much.html">gave some concrete ideas</a> for how Apple can deal with the wild world of import taxes, I’m taking a more speculative bent. Specifically, how could tariffs be an opportunity for Apple?</p>
<p>That seems counterintuitive, I know, but hear me out: not everything Apple does needs to be directly impacted by whatever the administration of the United States decides to do this particular week/day/hour. And given the current volatile situation Apple (and the rest of the economy) finds itself in, maybe taking a beat to try and find the silver lining wouldn’t be such a bad thing after all.</p>
