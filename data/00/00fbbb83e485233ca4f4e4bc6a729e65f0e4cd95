<p>Australia has begun enforcing a new national rule requiring major social media platforms to block users under 16 or face large financial penalties, in what the government describes as a child-safety measure rather than an attempt to curb speech. The law, passed with support from both major political parties, obliges 10 of the biggest platforms to introduce age-assurance systems that can reliably determine whether users are at least 16. Supporters, including many parents, argue the move responds to evidence linking heavy social media use with harms such as bullying and mental health problems in young people. Critics warn that determined teenagers are already finding workarounds, and raise concerns about privacy, enforcement challenges and potential impacts on young people’s access to information.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/mRnM6rESCZlx9tTk9BpaNPbYsynAWg_gFq011E6of0gBn3lTTIH2lODa5PaMx6_QTE4cPAQ1BBPZ5JCh0K3t4mcBC35VJ52_UTGlbggTx_HbGXYTJ6EzRpRfpJLAb1892YX5htNtyHrG9Cp5FLIgLTOLpRE5tHeTK3HmwHX0oY41RWJYnTuLbSb-Goj-g91iLg3N7_7s4T7eOuoklaM2KSsgrAyMln18ghx2bPdkEdo3cmhi5gL83ShITSbIDYVcTNb1LHxY4EtHaRDgnR-QES5as9SLeszheubr7gHw2uLkQ5ZnTmAX3E1Dt_L5AoHVZOndaHRlM7F3VB5C-33v08tjRloRs3-heV5X0v3nIYb63jXUPE5NTsks5FtC--wbLzkgPYUXzdTMamE-DCXIk1tJMrQDIwUccEvkzbBIND6n9quA_ZR6JwCte6NRC_hmsqSo600D8pPhJr4z24QnzRFgaU5549eDbXWlUHORAbOzFcyuF_aL_4uwXEmpWw' alt='A person uses a smartphone as Australia’s under‑16 social media ban comes into force.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Verification duty: Under the new framework, platforms must actively verify users’ ages instead of relying on self-declared birthdates, with non‑compliance exposing companies to fines reportedly reaching tens of millions of Australian dollars.</li><li>Teen reactions: Within a day of the ban taking effect, Australian feeds—including the prime minister’s own TikTok account—featured posts from users claiming to be under 16, some joking that they would simply wait until they could vote to respond.</li><li>Parental support: Polling cited by officials suggests roughly three-quarters of Australian parents back the ban or similar age-based restrictions, reflecting broad community concern about online risks to children.</li><li>Global interest: Governments in other countries are closely monitoring Australia’s rollout as they explore their own options for age-based safeguards on apps such as TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook.</li><li>Policy rationale: Commentary around the law frames it as an effort to shift responsibility for children’s online safety from families alone to a mix of democratic institutions, regulators and large technology firms.</li></ul><blockquote>The idea that this was going to be perfect on day one and there wouldn&#x27;t be a process needed is just not a reality. - Anthony Albanese</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Australian government: Prime Minister Anthony Albanese argues the restrictions are a necessary child-safety step that will take time to bed in but are intended to reduce harm to young people.
