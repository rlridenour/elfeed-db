<p>Dozens of Indigenous demonstrators briefly pushed through security barriers at the main entrance to the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, on Tuesday, clashing with security guards as they demanded stronger climate action and protection of forests and land rights. Organisers said parts of the venue were damaged and some security staff sustained minor injuries during the incident, but the protesters dispersed shortly afterwards and the site was secured. The protest highlighted Indigenous demands that negotiators give greater voice to forest protection and oppose agribusiness and extractive activities in the Amazon, a theme organisers and activists raised throughout the summit.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RjKhtgYcV1FaXwq4VscaGnVbkDB5hPSkriXdr3tZw1CQo-rffz9dLi-jWGhLPKebfOaPDR3NIvdeWs-Vyr1YovcpNhmIezkoD4ROR6n59kAmnApRhMZYcP_q6if8SQed5A9C5pYefnb93gCL6_WCR-o3Mr-3WUv3rtfsJgT0Nw' alt='Protesters confront security at the main entrance to the COP30 venue in Belém during clashes on November 11–12, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Security injuries: Summit spokespeople reported &#x27;minor injuries&#x27; to security staff after the scuffle at the entrance, and at least one guard was treated for injuries sustained during the breach.</li><li>Damage reported: Video and eyewitness reports show parts of the conference venue were damaged during the attempt to force entry, according to multiple news accounts.</li><li>Protest symbols: Participants wore traditional Indigenous dress, waved flags and placards calling for land rights, and chanted slogans such as &#x27;our land is not for sale&#x27; to underline cultural and territorial claims.</li><li>Blue Zone disruption: Authorities closed the secure &#x27;Blue Zone&#x27; area after the incursion and formed human chains to prevent further entry, temporarily restricting access for some delegates and visitors.</li></ul><blockquote>Our land is not for sale - Indigenous protesters</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Indigenous protesters: They said they demanded greater access to negotiations, stronger forest protection and rights over their lands, rejecting agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal mining and illegal logging.
