<p>French prosecutors searched the Paris headquarters of Elon Musk’s social media platform X as part of a widening cybercrime investigation into whether the company facilitated or failed to stop the spread of child sexual abuse images, sexualized deepfakes and Holocaust denial content. The raid, carried out by the Paris prosecutor’s cybercrime unit with support from the national police’s cyber unit and Europol, follows a preliminary probe that began in early 2025 and has since been expanded to cover alleged abuse of algorithms, biased data processing and fraudulent data extraction linked to X and its AI chatbot Grok. Prosecutors have summoned Musk and former X chief executive Linda Yaccarino to Paris in April for &quot;voluntary interviews,&quot; while several X employees in France have also been called as witnesses. The investigation comes amid broader efforts in France and across the European Union to enforce stricter online safety and data rules, and illustrates how regulators are testing new tools to curb the most harmful uses of social media and generative AI while still keeping digital platforms open for legitimate expression.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7p3HYreitJC4K14j5NnFV_P1fVN6kruGUXXe-8xtWIi-Ij0lwiLZF1N059uGupLCALxlbjBYwmtV4nvwSTDYve7deeUni2uwAVUmpgkkNx7GBjk3VW2DzP-p0zt3736pKEA88t8UhZGxxrdOfptfY7QxCZrUmj7JwqqBLMJ7otVrbfDZXyv29k4' alt='Elon Musk pictured in Davos, Switzerland, weeks before French cybercrime investigators searched X’s Paris headquarters.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Alleged offences: The French probe covers suspected possession and organized distribution of child pornography, creation of sexualized deepfakes involving women and children, dissemination of content denying the Holocaust, and interference in automated data processing systems through biased algorithms.</li><li>Focus on Grok AI: Investigators are examining whether Grok, X’s generative AI chatbot, enabled users to create sexualized deepfake images and other prohibited content after being integrated into the platform in Europe.</li><li>Data and algorithms: Prosecutors are also looking into suspected fraudulent extraction of user data and whether X’s recommendation systems and algorithms were manipulated in ways that distorted how information was processed and displayed.</li><li>Prosecutors leave X platform: The Paris prosecutor’s office announced the search in a post on X and simultaneously said it would stop publishing on the platform, signaling a shift to other channels for official communication.</li><li>UK and EU scrutiny: Separately from the French criminal probe, UK regulator Ofcom and the European Commission have opened investigations into whether X’s handling of Grok and harmful content complies with Britain’s Online Safety Act and the EU’s Digital Services Act.</li></ul><blockquote>We will not comment on an ongoing investigation but we are fully co-operating with the authorities. - Spokesperson for X</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Paris prosecutor’s office: The cybercrime unit said the search and summonses form part of a preliminary investigation into possible offences including the spread of child sexual abuse images, deepfakes and misuse of algorithms on the X platform.
