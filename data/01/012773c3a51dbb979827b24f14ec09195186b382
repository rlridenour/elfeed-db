<p>According to a <a href="https://electionbettingodds.com/House-Control-2026.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">site</a> that aggregates data from several betting markets, bettors think there&#8217;s a 63.9% chance that the Democratic Party will regain control of the US House of Representatives in the midterm elections scheduled for November 3rd, 2026.<span id="more-55257"></span></p>
<p>This is aligned with historically-informed analyses of the election, such as <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-history-tells-us-about-the-2026-midterm-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one from Brookings</a>.</p>
<p>None of the betting sites appears to be taking bets on this question: &#8220;Will the 2026 US midterm elections take place?&#8221;</p>
<p>Is that good news?</p>
<p>The question of whether the elections will happen has been one I&#8217;ve been concerned about for several months, and I don&#8217;t have a good grasp of whether this is a reasonable or bonkers question.</p>

<p>Even though philosophers may have difficulty conclusively <em>answering</em> certain kinds of questions, we tend to have strengths in identifying and evaluating questions. So I thought I would put it to you, dear readers: is &#8220;will there be midterm elections&#8221; a reasonable question?</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I mean by &#8216;reasonable question&#8217;?&#8221; you might (quite reasonably) ask. So here are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a question&#8217;s being reasonable:</p>
<ul>
<li>just</li>
<li>kidding.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&#8217;m after is whether concern about the elections taking place is more like concern about whether my old car will explode next time I&#8217;m driving it (not a reasonable concern) or more like concern that my old car may need to have its transmission replaced in the next couple of years (a reasonable concern).</p>
<p>Since one (the main? the only?) factor affecting the reasonability of the question is the likelihood of the occurrence it asks about, reasons brought to bear on it will probably be relevant to answering the first-order question, too, and vice versa. So you&#8217;re welcome to just take up the first-order question directly, if you prefer.</p>
<p>Basically, what I&#8217;m asking you all to do is make me feel better. Either you&#8217;ll convince me that the question isn&#8217;t reasonable, in which case I can be a little happier about the future of the United States. Or you&#8217;ll convince me that the question is reasonable, in which case I can be a little happier about my political judgment. Thanks.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/10/08/will-there-be-midterm-elections/">Will There Be Midterm Elections?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
