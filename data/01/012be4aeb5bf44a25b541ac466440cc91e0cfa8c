<p><b>Colorado Summer Seminar in Philosophy: Methods and Models<br />
</b>Dates: June 7 – June 26, 2026<br />
Location: Boulder, Colorado<br />
Contact: David <span class="il">Boonin</span> – <a href="mailto:david.boonin@colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">david.<span class="il">boonin</span>@colorado.edu</a><br />
Deadline: March 13, 2026<br />
Description: Philosophers employ a variety of methods to develop arguments for their conclusions. These include arguments from analogy, inference to the best explanation, reflective equilibrium, conceptual analysis, debunking arguments, transcendental arguments, arguments by reductio ad absurdum, and appeals to the results of introspection. In addition, some areas of philosophy, like game theory, formal epistemology, and philosophy of physics, make special use of theoretical models to help grapple with particularly complex phenomena. The 2026 Summer Seminar will explore a variety of these methods and models as they appear in contemporary and historical works across a wide range of philosophical subfields. Some sessions of the Seminar will focus primarily on questions about a particular method or model. We may spend a day, for example, looking at arguments for and against the use of reflective equilibrium, or of appeals to intuitions about hypothetical cases. Other sessions will largely focus on assessing the merits of a particular argument that makes use of a particular method, but these sessions, too, will include attention to broader questions about the advantages and disadvantages of the method the argument uses. And as an extra bonus this year, the 2026 Summer Seminar will be run in conjunction with the 2026 Formal Epistemology Workshop, which will take place in Boulder June 19-21. During the second week of the Seminar, some faculty from the Workshop will prepare the Seminar students to participate in the Workshop by covering some fundamental background material in formal epistemology. In this way, every student in the Summer Seminar will be able to participate in the Workshop regardless of whether they have had any previous exposure to formal epistemology, and previous familiarity with formal methods in philosophy more generally is in no way a prerequisite for attending the Seminar. If anything, the 2026 Summer Seminar may be a particularly valuable experience for those students with a strong background in philosophy who have not yet had the opportunity to reflect more generally on questions raised by the philosophical techniques they have been using in their classes.</p>
