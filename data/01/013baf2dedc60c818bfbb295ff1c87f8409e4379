<p>This is my first attempt at using <a href="https://github.com/rnadler/elfeed-curate">elfeed-curate</a> to collect interesting blog posts and share them. I have also attempted to subscribe to the RSS feed for the #Emacs hashtag on Mastodon, but that doesn’t seem to be working correctly yet. I’ve seen other blogs do similar things, but is this useful for my blog? I don’t know! Let me know what you think.</p>

The Tour of Untimely Departures is an annual event at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland. But guess what?
It’s already sold out! It sold out a while back, but I didn’t notice because my RSS feed for the
Friends of Lone Fir was broken.</li>
