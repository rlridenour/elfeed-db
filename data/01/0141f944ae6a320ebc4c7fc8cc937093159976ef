<p>Staff at Wat Rat Prakhong Tham temple in Nonthaburi province, near Bangkok, were preparing a cremation when they noticed faint knocking from a coffin and saw the 65‑year‑old woman inside begin to move. Her family had brought her to the temple after she had lain unresponsive at home for two days, leading her brother to believe she had died and arrange funeral rites without a formal death certificate. Temple workers called emergency services, and responders transported her to a nearby hospital, where doctors reportedly found she had critically low blood sugar that likely explained her deep unresponsiveness. Local officials have since opened an inquiry into the events, and Thai media reports say the woman’s relatives are cooperating with authorities as she receives medical care.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/AS-ZR2XslicMDcuQL5_VvMKG6T5ivovhy3KWlxGphgxx8FwwZ_IxlHDadjN0zWkBFagx78-7Iezk6lBICmrIB3vG0ZmQe8vYQuGQ9EMbxcCQvAM0Hs8oHo-VMoc9RZSQdWo0jiQoDljIy-IfE_q-NCEeshZBVdriZgjz67RIhLWuRAi3ujpES06RENI7YyhPb_SRI60GPhLc4TFtM45-yDrgFk9cZV72' alt='A pickup truck carrying a white coffin to a Thai temple for cremation, similar to the vehicle used when the woman was discovered alive.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Temple’s quick reaction: Video posted on the temple’s Facebook page shows staff clustered around the open coffin on the back of a pickup truck, talking urgently as they realize the woman is still moving and call for medical help.</li><li>Family’s account: The woman’s brother told local media he had tried to wake her for two days at home and, after failing to detect breathing or a pulse, contacted a rescue foundation and a mortuary service to take her body to the temple for cremation.</li><li>Medical explanation: Doctors at the hospital later assessed that the woman’s extremely low blood sugar could have put her into such a weakened state that she appeared lifeless, according to Thai media cited by Al Jazeera.</li><li>Official inquiry: Nonthaburi provincial authorities said they would review how the case was handled, including why no doctor issued a death certificate before the body was sent for cremation, and whether any regulations were breached.</li><li>Cultural context: In parts of Thailand, families sometimes arrange funerals at temples with the help of rescue foundations and private undertakers, especially when deaths occur at home, which can contribute to informal handling of remains before medical confirmation.</li></ul><blockquote>Everyone was startled when she started moving her hands and head inside the coffin - Phra Kru Adisorn Thammapanyakhun</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Temple abbot: The abbot described how staff noticed slight movements in the coffin, immediately halted preparations for the cremation, and called for emergency assistance, emphasizing that their priority became saving the woman’s life once they realized she might still be alive.
