<p>It can’t have been easy being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka">Franz Kafka</a>. But then, it can’t have been much easier being Franz Kafka’s fiancée, as evidenced by the correspondence read aloud by Richard Ayoade in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjD93xVrZsM">the new <em>Letters Live</em> video above</a>. “It is now 10:30 on Monday morning,” he wrote to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felice_Bauer">Felice Bauer</a> on November 4, 1912. “I have been waiting for a letter since 10:30 on Saturday morning, but again nothing has come. I have written every day but don’t I deserve even a word? One single word? Even if it were only to say ‘I never want to hear from you again.’&nbsp;” This anxious, hectoring tone was not a one-off indulgence. “Dearest, what have I done that makes you torment me so?” he pleaded just over two weeks later.</p>
<p>Kafka and Bauer had been introduced three months before. She was a relative of Max Brod, Kafka’s friend and eventual literary executor, and according to Kafka’s diaries, made a fairly unprepossessing first impression: “Bony, empty face that wore its emptiness openly. Bare throat. A blouse thrown on. Looked very domestic in her dress although, as it turned out, she by no means was.”</p>

<p>Yet during their ensuing five-year correspondence, he was moved to write her more than 500 letters, some of them sent one day after the other — and more than a few berating her for not writing back quickly enough.</p>
<p>This relationship twice led to engagement, but perhaps unsurprisingly, never culminated in marriage. Nevertheless, Bauer’s relationship with Kafka remained important enough to her that she saved everything he wrote to her, which was collected and published in book form as <em>Briefe an Felice </em>(and later, in translation, as <a href="https://amzn.to/41jkPMw"><em>Letters to Felice</em></a>) in 1967. Perhaps, as burdensome as they could no doubt be, Kafka’s letters suggested to Bauer a certain literary skill. (This was, after all, the same period in which he wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/3Jrbs7p"><em>The Metamorphosis</em> </a>and “<a href="https://www.kafka-online.info/in-the-penal-colony.html">In the Penal Colony</a>,” as well as early versions of <a href="https://amzn.to/45CeuhL"><em>The Trial</em>)</a>. They also hint at his <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2016/02/david-foster-wallace-reads-franz-kafkas-short-story-a-little-fable.html">since-celebrated sense of humor</a>, not least in a concluding line like “Damn the mail!” — words that, in Ayoade’s delivery, draw a round of applause.</p>
