<p>What a wild story. While it’s been rumored that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/apple-explores-home-robots-after-abandoning-car-efforts">Apple researchers have been working on robots</a>, now those researchers have published their results, including a pretty amazing video.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  A team of robotics researchers at Apple have designed and prototyped a lamp-like robot with lifelike movements, <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/elegnt-expressive-functional-movement">according to a blog post</a> and accompanying video published last month on the Apple Machine Learning Research website. The lamp, which reminds us of the cute Pixar mascot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0CmJa5Gdk">Luxo Jr.</a>, may hint at Apple’s future plans.

<p>If we know anything about Apple is that forthcoming products <em>do not</em> show up in research papers and videos before they’re released. But that doesn’t mean Apple isn’t intending on using this sort of tech in some specific applications down the road.</p>
<p>Gurman’s original report said that Apple “has developed an advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around, they said.” This sure sounds like it’s related to whatever Gurman’s sources were talking about.</p>

<p>I’m not sure I’d bet on anything like what’s depicted in the video becoming a product anytime soon, but it’s a pretty amazing video nonetheless.</p>
