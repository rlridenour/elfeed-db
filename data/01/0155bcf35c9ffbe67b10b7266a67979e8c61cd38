<p>Venezuelan authorities detained Colombian-Venezuelan businessman Alex Saab in Caracas, according to reports. A U.S. official told Reuters that Saab could be extradited to the United States in the coming days. Colombian media, cited by MercoPress and Reuters, said the detention was part of a joint operation involving Venezuela’s intelligence service (SEBIN) and the FBI. Reuters also reported that authorities arrested Raúl Gorrín—another politically connected businessman sought by U.S. authorities—in Caracas. The New York Times said Venezuelan authorities questioned both Saab and Gorrín.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Ngk56m6w0dxYTtLB7VhxrtkZe4wML_DhLYmsRO4pqkZZgeeLDjRmpooM-i2FuJ8gamOAqEJCXPA17zE7Ncs2nlZHcidQHfLovml9sjdMdZ11ohemb1m4R6MNSsYLDfjxMf4IL88upSuyTmSz8srOlLynWatGbw_xU6BR2_pK4O5cPGv0YzAnmVWWywjWJ21Aua8Kz6-F4H1Qmea0mDDmsXbKpvsDhOs_fibIiwvIqkr7l5hRRzdCJx2ylZCXFpWJBho' alt='Alex Saab is seen in a Reuters photo used by The Hindu alongside reporting on his rearrest.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who was detained: Saab, 54, has been portrayed by U.S. authorities as a key financial operator for Chavismo.
