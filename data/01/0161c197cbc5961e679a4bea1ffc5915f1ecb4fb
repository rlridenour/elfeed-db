<p>Had some time to think about writing micro.blog documentations, and I&rsquo;m considering TiddlyWiki again. <a href="https://micro.blog/jbaty@social.lol">@jbaty@social.lol</a> would probably agree with me: when it comes to presenting technical documentation and instructions to others, TW is much better than org-mode.</p>
<p>The same issue as I had in the past though: writing in Emacs is how I do things, and how I work on my notes. Converting org-mode to TW format (tiddlers) adds friction. I&rsquo;ve been in this spot several times before&hellip;</p>
