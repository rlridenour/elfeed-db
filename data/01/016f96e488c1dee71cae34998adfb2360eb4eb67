<p>Huge fan of Chicken Karaage, but never really made it at home until recently.</p>

<h2>Dice the chicken</h2>
<ul>
<li>350 grams boneless chicken thighs</li>
</ul>
<p>Dice the chicken up.</p>
<h2>Marinade for 30 mins</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon soy sauce (Kikkoman or similar)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon cooking Sake</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of grated ginger (include liquids)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon Mirin</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix all ingredients into a ziploc bag. Add the diced chicken and let it marinade for 30 minutes in the fridge.</p>
<h2>Pat dry</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paper towels</li>
</ul>
<p>After marinating, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and set aside.</p>
<h2>Breading</h2>
<ul>
<li>Potato starch</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, not quite breading since we're using potato starch but same goal. Sprinkle the chicken pieces and make sure they are fully coated with the starch.</p>
<h2>Frying (1st round)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vegetable oil</li>
<li>Paper towels</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat up (roughly at 160°C) enough oil in a pan to cover the chicken pieces. Cook for about 3 minutes. The pieces don't have to be super golden at this point. There will be another round of frying for that.</p>
<h2>Rest for 4 minutes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paper towels</li>
</ul>
<p>Let the chicken rest on paper towels for about 4 minutes before frying again.</p>
<h2>Frying (2nd round)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vegetable oil</li>
<li>Paper towels</li>
</ul>
<p>This time heat up the oil at roughly 200°C. This is a quick in-and-out action to make the chicken crispy. Cook for 30 seconds. Take out and set aside on some paper towels. Let it cool and it's ready to eat.</p>
<h2>Dipping</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kewpie mayo</li>
<li>Sriracha sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>This is totally optional, but I'm a fan of both Kewpie mayo and Sriracha sauce. You can dip your chicken in either or both!</p>
