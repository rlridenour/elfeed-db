<p>Venezuela’s National Assembly approved an amnesty bill in a first vote on February 5. The measure would grant clemency to people jailed for participating in political protests and in certain opposition-linked cases pursued in recent years under Nicolás Maduro. Lawmakers still must pass a second vote before it can take effect; supporters say it could help bring about the release of political detainees. Several outlets emphasized that the draft sets limits on who would qualify. It explicitly excludes cases involving “gross” human-rights abuses from the Chávez and Maduro eras, an effort to avoid blanket impunity while still addressing prosecutions tied to dissent. The bill would also lift bans on running for office for some opposition figures, according to reporting on its provisions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/xjhI16qJHyHmYPYajtEHRdcr2pP78napGH3PjnaFybrZ1NGwx4gpl91NQvW9YB_sTJQfX2ICUb60PFQVNNK3DhGGkhSZ8WSF7GKkuwjrXxTdPgxpQ6stTlHyPiySFhQf4rWYneQWLBktU7SUKsf1FH0386ejPdER-RKS7xvZ29wmR5qVX8aNtcDMIKtsAXkF4cHWTlFs9BtbuTUZUkm-WWmxnH3K8swjHk5jSlb7x4OOICtvH58aMtuXfeq-KxSnSgTrbO1UpxAyznAVjw' alt='Venezuela’s National Assembly during debate on an amnesty proposal.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Beyond street protests: The draft would grant clemency not only for protest-related offenses, but also for some cases involving people jailed for criticizing public figures, according to reporting on its scope.</li><li>How sponsors frame urgency: MercoPress described lawmakers as moving an “urgent” amnesty aimed at freeing jailed protesters and government critics from recent years.</li><li>Transition narrative: Deutsche Welle highlighted opposition figures calling the first vote a milestone in a post-Maduro transition effort, with expectations of broader releases if the bill clears the next step.</li><li>Era-spanning rationale: Firstpost reported the draft targets charge types used to imprison dissidents under both Nicolás Maduro and Hugo Chávez, underscoring supporters’ view that it addresses a longer arc of politically linked prosecutions.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Venezuela’s National Assembly (bill sponsors): Lawmakers advanced an amnesty proposal meant to free jailed protesters and government critics, framing it as a step toward resolving politically driven detentions.
