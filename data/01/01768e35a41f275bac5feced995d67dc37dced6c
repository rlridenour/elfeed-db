<p>Anthony Lane, in a crackerjack piece for The New Yorker on the writing and work of Elmore Leonard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, when does Leonard become himself? Is it possible to specify
the moment, or the season, when he crosses the border? I would
nominate “The Big Bounce,” from 1969 — which, by no coincidence,
is the first novel of his to be set in the modern age. As the
prose calms down, something quickens in the air, and the plainest
words and deeds make easy music: “They discussed whether beer was
better in bottles or cans, and then which was better, bottled or
draft, and both agreed, finally, that it didn’t make a hell of a
lot of difference. Long as it was cold.”</p>

<p>What matters here is what isn’t there. Grammatically, by rights,
we ought to have an “As” or a “So” before “long.” If the beer
drinkers were talking among themselves, however, or <em>to</em>
themselves, they wouldn’t bother with such nicety, and Leonard
heeds their example; he does them the honor of flavoring his
registration of their chatter with that perfect hint of them. The
technical term for this trick, as weary students of literature
will recall, is <em>style indirect libre</em>, or free indirect
discourse. It has a noble track record, with Jane Austen and
Flaubert as front-runners, but seldom has it proved so
democratically wide-ranging — not just <em>libre</em> but liberating,
too, as Leonard tunes in to regular citizens. He gets into their
heads, their palates, and their plans for the evening. Listen to a
guy named Moran, in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cat-Chaser-Novel-Elmore-Leonard/dp/0062190954/?tag=df-amzn-20">Cat Chaser</a>” (1982), watching
Monday-night football and trying to decide “whether he should have
another beer and fry a steak or go to Vesuvio’s on Federal Highway
for spaghetti marinara and eat the crisp breadsticks with hard
butter, Jesus, and have a bottle of red with it, the house salad
... or get the chicken cacciatore and slock the bread around in
the gravy ...”</p>

<p>The ellipses are Leonard’s, or, rather, they are Moran’s musings,
reproduced by Leonard as a kind of Morse code. We join in with the
dots. But it’s the “Jesus” that does the work, yielding up a
microsecond of salivation, and inviting us to slock around in the
juice of the character’s brain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The genius in the second example is the verb choice: <em><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slock">slock</a></em>. There are dozens of verbs that could have worked there, but none better.</p>

<p>Leonard is probably tops on the list of authors whose work I love, but of which I haven’t read nearly as much as I should. There are novelists who are good at creating (and voicing) original vivid characters, novelists who are good at plot, and novelists who are just great at <em>writing</em>. Leonard hits the trifecta.</p>
