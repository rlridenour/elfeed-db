<p>Russian authorities have begun throttling Telegram. Users reported widespread disruptions starting February 9 after the federal communications watchdog Roskomnadzor announced “phased restrictions” on the app, citing alleged legal violations and what the government calls Telegram’s failure to curb its use for “criminal and terrorist purposes”. The move aligns with a broader push to steer Russians toward a more tightly controlled, state-backed messaging alternative, even as Telegram remains central to everyday communication and a key channel for public updates from many actors, including official bodies. Critics, including rights groups and press-freedom advocates, describe the restrictions as censorship and part of a wider effort to expand surveillance and control over information flows.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/sy11E3yqGrFn8CfYsK0tDr4yJmpCHuG_m7L2HRGIwG6AHym1PKoMHbphYQXNo-q3XNRhKwzFQtNqV6Y-R5vDyYsXYLr-GMzLCifPbWe8Ko9E' alt='A web page of the Russian messenger app MAX displayed on a smartphone next to a screen showing the logo of WhatsApp and Telegram applications in this illustration taken on September 4, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of use: The New York Times said more than 100 million Russians use Telegram, so a slowdown is likely to ripple through everyday messaging, calls, and news consumption.</li><li>Officials’ dilemma: Meduza flagged a practical snag for the government: many Russian authorities and public institutions also rely on Telegram for communication, even as regulators tighten restrictions.</li><li>Front-line concerns: Meduza said the slowdown angered pro-war “Z-bloggers,” including sarcastic remarks likening restrictions on Telegram for Russians to being unable to “disable Starlink” for Ukrainians.</li><li>Press-freedom alarm: Reporters Without Borders denounced what it called a strategy to choke the flow of information and pointed to Russia’s rank of 171 out of 180 in its World Press Freedom Index.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Roskomnadzor (Russia’s communications watchdog): The regulator said it will “continue to introduce phased restrictions” on Telegram over alleged legal violations, as officials promote a state-backed rival messaging service.
