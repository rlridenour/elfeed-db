<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 10 licenses ($149.99 value each) for <a href="https://ministryofbits.com/summit/">Summit</a>. Summit is an elegant tool for making the most of meetings, from building agendas to keeping meetings on track with timers and other tools. If you&rsquo;re in charge of meeting planning, whether for work or your personal clubs and groups, you should check Summit out. (Also available for Windows.)</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Summit is a macOS app that helps professionals run smarter, more focused meetings. With tools for setting clear agendas, automatic time tracking, and built-in support for creating polished meeting minutes, Summit brings order to the chaos and turns meetings into a productive part of your workflow. If your meetings often run long, lose focus, or generate more confusion than clarity, Summit helps you tighten things up and get real results.</p>
