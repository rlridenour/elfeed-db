<p>Well, it looks like my KVM switch finally died. Before I rush-purchase a new one, I was wondering if anyone has a recommendation for one, or for a different solution altogether?</p>
<p>I have a MacBook Pro M1 and a PC (Desktop running Pop-OS).
They were sharing a widescreen 27'' screen and a Kinesis Gaming mechanical keyboard, and a Logitech Bluetooth mouse via this setup. I also have a webcam and speakers (USB) that I&rsquo;d like to switch also this way, I couldn&rsquo;t do it with the KVM switch.</p>
<p>I could run the Pop OS desktop on MS RD or another remote desktop solution, but that&rsquo;s not ideal for gaming (prefer to be connected directly).</p>
<p>So what do folks out there do?</p>
