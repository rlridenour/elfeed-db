<p>President Trump exchanged sharp words with female reporters this week, calling a Bloomberg journalist “piggy” during an on‑board press exchange and telling an ABC News reporter she was “terrible” after questions about the Jeffrey Epstein files. The Air Force One remark occurred while he was speaking to reporters, and the ABC exchange happened during a White House visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, after which the President threatened ABC’s broadcast licence. Commentators and coverage of the incidents noted they fit a pattern of dismissive, personal comments toward women in the media in previous reports.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fIc6wWMUdIlOQKdQB1CCHN76adMIklrnMZcWZBCDZ2hk6P90dyA2xfn2zMdxMLpLSc2YbqLEOLHBYiCFKQHaaixtubfnJHXa1lUJSHTh30Q_n7p60T7jVIuZbqwlrVeOnVkHuFynXpjEByO2BHHSDuU_OJMPFPD8VD2SxmY' alt='&#x27;Quiet, quiet piggy&#x27;: headline image accompanying coverage of the exchange' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Exact wording: On Air Force One the president interrupted a question and used the phrase &#x27;quiet, piggy&#x27; to address a female reporter, according to video and transcripts.</li><li>Different settings: The two incidents occurred in separate venues—one on board Air Force One and the other during a White House visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—showing the exchanges happened across multiple presidential settings.</li><li>Regulatory threat: After the White House exchange the President said ABC could face loss of its broadcast licence, an escalation noted in multiple reports as an unusual public threat toward a major U.S. broadcaster.</li><li>Pattern of conduct: Analysts and coverage point to a longer record of the President making dismissive personal remarks toward women journalists in past encounters, framing these episodes as part of that pattern.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Firstpost (analysis): The exchange fits a long record of dismissive, personal comments aimed at women in the media, rather than being an isolated incident.
