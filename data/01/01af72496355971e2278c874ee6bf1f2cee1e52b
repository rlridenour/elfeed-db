<p>The cycle’s about to begin anew: Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-the-week-of-june-9/">announced on Tuesday</a> that its 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference will run June 9-13. The event, including keynote and sessions, will be available for free online, along with a limited in-person component at Apple Park.</p>
<p>As with the last several years, in-person attendance will be by lottery, with current Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program members <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/special-event/">eligible to apply</a> for a chance to join. In addition to viewing the keynote and Platform State of the Union, attendees will be able to get one-on-one and group lab time with Apple employees as well as tour the campus and participate in some other “special activities.”</p>
<p>Applications are open for just over a week, until April 2. Fifty “Distinguished Winners” of the Swift Student Challenge, who will be announced this Thursday, March 27, will also be automatically invited to the event.</p>
<p>Apple’s widely expected to announce the latest updates to its various software platforms, including iOS 19 and macOS 16, at this year’s event, but one big question mark hanging over the conference will be how the company handles <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2641618/all-this-ai-drama-is-making-apple-wwdc-in-june-a-lot-more-interesting.html">the recent delay of Apple Intelligence features</a>.</p>
