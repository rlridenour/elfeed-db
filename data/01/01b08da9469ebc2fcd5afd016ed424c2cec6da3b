I wear T-shirts pretty much exclusively but I don&rsquo;t have any Emacs T-shirts. The designs just don&rsquo;t appeal to me. Charles Choi <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/emacs-elevator-pitch-nerd-kitch-merch.html">to the rescue</a>. I really like the first two.

Choi generated them with Gemini as a lark so they&rsquo;re not really available but I&rsquo;m sure it would be easy to get some made by providing the images to any of several companies that silk screen T-shirts.

Regardless, this is just a quick, whimsical post to help you get over hump day</p>
