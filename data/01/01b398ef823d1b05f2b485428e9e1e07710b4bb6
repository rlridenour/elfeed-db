<p>Wired, two weeks ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elon Musk’s lawyers claimed that he “does not use a computer” in a
Sunday court filing related to his <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-sues-sam-altman-openai/">lawsuit against Sam
Altman</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wild-claim-at-the-heart-of-elon-musks-openai-lawsuit/">OpenAI</a>. However, Musk has posted pictures or
referred to his laptop on X several times in recent months, and
public evidence suggests that he owns and appears to use at least
one computer. [...]</p>

<p>The Sunday court filing was submitted in opposition to a Friday
filing from OpenAI, which accused Musk and xAI of failing to fully
comply with the discovery process. OpenAI alleges that Musk’s
counsel does not plan to collect any documents from him. In this
weekend’s filing, Musk’s lawyers claim that they told OpenAI on
June 14 that they were “conducting searches of Mr. Musk’s mobile
phone, having searched his emails, and that Mr. Musk does not use
a computer.”</p>

<p>It’s almost enough to make you think maybe Elon Musk is not a straight shooter.</p>
