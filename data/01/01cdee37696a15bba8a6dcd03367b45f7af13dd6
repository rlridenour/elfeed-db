<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/10/airpods-pro-3-features/">AirPods Pro 3</a> demand was so strong after the earbuds launched in September that their popularity reportedly "caught Apple off guard."<br/>

"AirPods Pro 3 were supply-constrained during the quarter, and we think we would have grown year over year if we would not have been constrained," Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-sales-profit-beat-wall-street-estimates-amid-staggering-iphone-demand-2026-01-29/">told <em>Reuters</em></a>, in a report published alongside Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/apple-1q-2026-earnings/">record-breaking earnings results</a> for the fourth quarter of the 2025 calendar year.<br/>
<br/>
Cook was referring to Apple's Wearable, Home, and Accessories segment, which saw around a 2% drop in revenue year-over-year. His comment implies that if Apple had realized AirPods Pro 3 were going to be such a hit, the company could have had more inventory ready to ship and might have actually had revenue growth in this segment.<br/>
<br/>
AirPods Pro 3 no longer have any extended delivery delays on Apple's online store, so it would appear that Apple has caught up on supply by now.<br/>
