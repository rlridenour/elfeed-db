<li>60 bites per bag, so you get 240 total</li>
<li>Dogs like the taste</li>
<li>You’ll like how they restore your dogs’ joints (apparently)</li>
<li>Best by 5/30-6/30 (but still safe for pups to eat after that)</li>
<li>Check out our <a href="https://sidedeal.com/deals/zesty-paws-orastix-all-in-one-dental-bones">SideDeal Daily</a> for a bunch of bones!</li>
<li>Are they Mac compatible: No, unfortunately, you’ll have to find different joint-health snacks for your Apple products</li>
</ul><h1>Dog-gone Good For Them</h1><p>Okay, so in terms of whether or not you should buy these, it comes down to two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do dogs like them?</li>
</ol>
<p>And…</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do they actually help with hip and joint issues?</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, to be clear, since these are dogs we’re talking about, the answer to question 2 does rely on the answer to question 1.</p>
<p>We, as humans, will generally take our medicine. Something promises a hefty dose of vitamin C or electrolytes or caffeine or dextromethorphan and guaifenesin, we’ll plug our nose and swallow if we have to. But dogs? You could offer them a tablet capable of restoring them to energetic, healthy puppies, but if it tastes unappealing, they won’t have any part of it.</p>
<p>Luckily, the answer to both questions seems to be: yes.</p>
<p>That’s according to the Amazon reviews of these things, at least, where they earn a 4.4 out of 5 based on more than 4,800 reviews. In fact, the reviews make these things sound downright miraculous.</p>
<p>Here are just a few.</p>

<p>We purchased this for our Chihuahua to try to get her off of the dog aspirin. It is actually working better after a few days, so well we started giving one to our Schnauzer. Our Schnauzer is actually showing less signs of his age after a few days. This comes highly recommended.</p>

<p>My morkie loves the flavor, can’t wait to eat his vitamins and I can tell jumping down off small objects has become less of a scare for him. He’s feeling comfortable and healthy again after a couple of months with supplements.</p>

<p>And Nicola <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4GY6RNL7XRZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DK41YJ9B&tag=mehdown-20">agrees</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I tell you that these mobility bites have changed my dogs’ lives, I’m not exaggerating one bit. They all have gotten two bites a day, for exactly 14 days now. Our boxer is leaping around, jumping up and down off the couch, chases his favorite soccer ball around, and has reverted to standing on his back legs to give hugs again!!! I haven’t weighed him yet, but our terrier mix is looking thinner, his eyes are brighter, his ears are standing up a lot more, and best of all…HE TRIED TO JUMP ON THE COUCH BY HIMSELF! If you had seen this dog two weeks ago, you wouldn’t believe it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All sounds amazing, right? In fact, it seems almost too good to be true.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: we’re offering these at ‘good tasting treat’ prices rather than ‘fix your dog’s joints’ prices. And sure, they’re a bit close to their best-by date, but they’re still worth a shot, right?</p>
<p>So give them a try. And, by that, we mean: give them to your dog. Don’t take them for your own joints.</p>
