 
          <p>This post is inspired by Johnny Webber&rsquo;s <a href="https://johnnywebber.com/2024-holiday-gift-guide/">2024 Holiday Gift Guide</a> that serves as a great starting point if you don&rsquo;t know what to get for your friends &amp; family. Johnny&rsquo;s list is broad and includes suggestions from tech to food, arts, gaming, books, and even writing material.</p>
<p>Making Christmas wish lists seems to become harder and harder as I get older and already have way too much stuff. When we are young, without access to a disposable income, the holiday period somehow felt more exciting. Flipping through toy store ad leaflets, whipping out scissors to cut and paste the things that drew our attention onto a separate colourful piece of paper for Santa to take a good look at. I want <em>this one</em>, and don&rsquo;t you dare to buy me that cheap alternative! We try to cut our way through the few ads that still land in our mailbox but it doesn&rsquo;t feel the same any more&mdash;a part of the genuine childlike excitement is gone for good.</p>
<p>It took me a while to come up with six items that made it to my list. Like Johnny, I&rsquo;m only recommending things I like. Here&rsquo;s a collage representing that list:</p>

</p>
<p>First, the <em>UFO 50</em> Nintendo Switch game&mdash;specifically the physical version published by <a href="https://www.fangamer.eu/">Fangamer.eu</a>, obviously. There&rsquo;s still a lot on my wish list, so any of the following is great as well: <em>Streets of Rage 4 Anniversary Edition</em>, <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, <em>Monster Boy &amp; The Cursed Kingdom</em>. If you happen to come across a copy of <em>Powerslave Exhumed</em> by Limited Run Games that&rsquo;s been out of print for a while, that would be very nice too. If you have no idea but want to make sure it&rsquo;s a good game, check out my <a href="/post/2024/11/i-made-my-own-top-100-page/">Top 100 suggestions</a>.</p>
<p>Second, a gift coupon to spent at our local book store <a href="https://boekhandelgrim-webshop.be/">GRIM</a>. Although my wife reminded me that we still have two coupons lying around that need to be used. I tried to come up with a concrete book title but my wanted list is a mess and I just bought six books that I haven&rsquo;t touched yet. Feel free to add your own favourite entry.</p>
<p>Third, Sailor&rsquo;s <em>Manyo Ume</em> fountain pen ink: a dark red/brown colour with a unique sheen (see the <a href="https://mountainofink.com/blog/sailor-manyo-ume">Mountain of Ink review</a>). Or add a tint of Pilot Irushizuku ink, but I&rsquo;ve never tried Sailor&rsquo;s before and don&rsquo;t have a colour that matches this range. Hopefully this will entice me to get back into writing on paper more which is a hobby I&rsquo;ve been neglecting too much lately.</p>
<p>Fourth, the <em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em> board game. I mentioned in the <a href="/post/2025/10/spiel-essen-2025/">SPIEL Essen post</a> that I wanted to grab a copy but ultimately left it for the Christmas list, so here it is. Two equally chunky alternatives might be <em>Tea Garden</em> or <em>Creature Caravan</em>. If you&rsquo;re looking for a lighter game, perhaps check out my <a href="/post/2025/09/modern-trick-taking-games-beyond-whist/">modern trick taking suggestions</a> instead.</p>
<p>Fifth, Manet&rsquo;s <em>Bundle Of Asparagus</em>. The original one, please. Enlist the Ocean&rsquo;s Eleven crew and send them to the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne, Germany. Or, if they happen to be busy, order a high quality reproduction, through for example <a href="https://wahooart.com/en/art/edouard-manet-bundle-of-asparagus-5ZKCAG-en/">Wahoo Art</a>. I&rsquo;m unsure about the working conditions and ethical beliefs of that system as I just stumbled on it, but if that&rsquo;s not an option, just a nice print will do. We&rsquo;ll have a resin coating added later that makes it look like the real thing. Ever since reading about the painting in Alain de Botton&rsquo;s <em>Art As Therapy</em>, I&rsquo;ve wanted to hang a copy in the kitchen. Plus, we&rsquo;re very fond of asparagus.</p>
<p>Lastly, a heavy duty dough mixer, or more specifically, the Italian made <a href="https://tomishop.de/famag-grilletta-im5s-knetmaschine">Famag Grilletta IM5S</a>. These spiral mixers are not cheap and come in at around <code>€800</code> so just a donation towards it will suffice. I&rsquo;ve been kneading by hand for twelve years but with the kids and our increased bread consumption rate it&rsquo;s getting harder to keep up. Plus, the Grilletta that kneads any dough to windowpane without blinking twice will finally enable me to make smooth buttery dough and up the hydration in the more rustic recipes. The IM5S&mdash;contrary to the IM5 model without the S&mdash;can be tilted to remove the bowl and more easily clean it.</p>
<p>Still unsure? My archives tell me the following things made it to previous Christmas wish lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>WoodWick candles</li>
<li>Random Magic: The Gathering boosters</li>
<li>An Apple Magic Keyboard I never got and eventually bought myself</li>
<li>An authentic Belgian waffle iron (you can&rsquo;t live without this if you&rsquo;re living in Belgium)</li>
<li>The book <em>Sourdough</em> by Robin Sloan</li>
<li>The cookbook <em>Marie Plukt De Dag</em></li>
<li>More Switch games like <em>The Witcher 3</em>, <em>Dragon Quest XI</em>, and <em>Metroid Dread</em></li>
<li>A GameCube HDMI adapter</li>
<li>A lovely pen roll to protect your precious fountain pens on the go</li>
<li>A soldering iron</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>
