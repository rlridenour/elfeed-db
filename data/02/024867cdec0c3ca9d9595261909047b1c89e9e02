<p>Apple has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125148">a page documenting all the updates to Shortcuts</a> in iOS/iPadOS/macOS 26, including new and updated actions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  For those building custom shortcuts, some actions have been updated:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Calculate Expression” can now evaluate expressions that include units, including real time currency conversion rates, temperature, distance, and more</li>
<li>“Create QR Code” can now specify colors and styling</li>
<li>“Date” can now specify a holiday</li>
<li>“Find Contacts” can now filter by relationship</li>
<li>“Transcribe Audio” performance has been improved</li>
<li>“Show Content” can now display scrollable lists of items, like calendar events, reminders, and more</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see improvements and even <em>nicer</em> to see them written down like this. I’d like to see even more Shortcuts documentation like this, because sometimes you don’t even know what you don’t know.</p>
