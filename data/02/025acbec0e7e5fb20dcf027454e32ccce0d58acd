<p>South African authorities have deployed an additional 3,500 police officers and placed the army on standby ahead of the Group of 20 summit in Johannesburg this weekend, preparing for planned demonstrations by local and international activists. Organizers and attendees note this is the G20’s first summit held in Africa, and leaders are using the meeting to press wealthy nations to step up support on climate-related disasters and resilience. The event is also occurring amid a diplomatic snag: President Trump and his administration are not attending, a development that has reshaped expectations for some bilateral talks at the summit.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Lz2uwTTtbxL2RXXng8tIE557n6pY1lbSP_62MmFp1H7durZHdvycuIz97wlfdVtPW8MQth_jttFSjUmKn9Wp-PJ6Rf34TCRX-iKkVeWagFdyXpcVzYrT2y9R6WOty26xIqm4R7AKt2PVciiQwU_NYN-HnXTFU25YLGTt0li0zg' alt='Delegates and security preparations ahead of the G20 summit in Johannesburg' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Show of force: Security forces staged a public parade featuring helicopters, K-9 units and officers on motorcycles to demonstrate preparedness for protests.</li><li>Joint command: Authorities placed forces under the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure, which unites police, army and intelligence components for coordinated security operations.</li><li>Who will protest: Organizers expect a wide mix of demonstrators, including anti-capitalists, climate activists, women&#x27;s rights campaigners and anti-migrant groups highlighting domestic poverty and inequality.</li><li>Summit focus: Attending leaders have emphasized urging wealthy countries to increase action and resources to tackle climate disasters and protect vulnerable communities.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>South African government: Officials have bolstered security ahead of the summit by deploying extra police and placing the army on standby to manage protests and protect delegates.
