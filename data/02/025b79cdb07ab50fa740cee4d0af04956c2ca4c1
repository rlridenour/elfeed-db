<p>A Georgia judge has dismissed the state-level racketeering case accusing President Donald Trump and several allies of attempting to interfere with the 2020 election results in Georgia, effectively ending the last remaining criminal prosecution linked to his post-election actions in US courts. The decision followed prosecutor Peter Skandalakis’ conclusion that continuing the sprawling case was not viable and that any remaining concerns about federal election conduct should be handled by US authorities rather than state courts. The ruling marks a significant legal victory for the President, who has long denied wrongdoing, and closes a chapter that once posed a serious legal challenge as he returned to the White House in January 2025. The collapse of the case also represents a setback for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, whose office had originally brought the charges before she was removed from overseeing the prosecution after ethics complaints from defense lawyers.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/N1glknhB5o2F_0o6u6p6VC_6eIcMYBS1ZiXDfTW8SBE9Nc6SunRy1BRUSEVaLYAqTmJm_XqgknEbdjShOn8kuBc5rhULIjZ0zRLvhU6No3DGtkgBPPDODfitD2eRqAxhRhZG3yMNgp2wD-2X0OBxxS78niF7fXjHRBu9TzLQQ5p09PiIBeXkTz5VeXhKVG3yAgEQ25_n7gj8-7JEPB8YXXjMjxi3NPx46Xhrwf3HKC4pPz8P_PRm1hZfVZWL3wH4l6fu0IJgIPJG-t3h0g' alt='President Donald Trump speaks with reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Florida in November 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Case origins: Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis first brought the wide-ranging racketeering indictment in 2023, alleging that President Trump and multiple co-defendants engaged in a criminal enterprise to overturn Georgia’s 2020 presidential vote results.</li><li>Change in leadership: After Willis was taken off the matter following ethics complaints from defense lawyers, the state appointed Peter Skandalakis to assume responsibility for evaluating whether the prosecution should continue.</li><li>Shift to federal jurisdiction: Prosecutors who argued for dismissal maintained that questions about alleged interference in the national election should be resolved by federal authorities, not by a state-level racketeering trial in Georgia.</li><li>End of criminal exposure: With the Georgia case thrown out, media reports note that the decision effectively ends the series of criminal prosecutions tied to President Trump’s efforts to challenge the 2020 election outcome.</li><li>Political backdrop: The dismissal comes as President Trump governs in his current term, removing an outstanding legal cloud that had followed him back into the White House after his inauguration in January 2025.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Trump and his allies have repeatedly rejected any wrongdoing and argued the prosecutions were politically motivated, characterizing the Georgia effort as a &quot;hoax&quot; and &quot;un-American&quot; in public comments reported by media..
