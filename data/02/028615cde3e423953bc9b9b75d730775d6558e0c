These days I like to write scripts for some tasks in Python instead of shell. One important reason I think that&#39;s because Python is powerful at string manipulation.</p>
<p>
Recently I&#39;m learning Clojure, and I&#39;m trying to find similar ways in Clojure, one of them is <code class="verbatim">s.title()</code> for getting a title-cased version of a string. For example,</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39; Hello world&#39;.title()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">&#39; Hello World&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
How to do that in Clojure? To make the problem simple, let&#39;s assume that the input string only has letters and spaces, that is, <code class="verbatim">[a-zA-Z ]</code> in regex pattern.</p>
