<p>Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, presented the new Labour government’s first budget in London on Wednesday, outlining tax increases on both wealthy and middle‑income households as well as on businesses, alongside higher public spending on services and welfare programmes. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the plans would lift the government’s tax take to its highest share of national income since World War II by the early 2030s, helping to meet deficit‑reduction rules after years of underfunded services and weak growth. Reeves argued that the package is designed to stabilise the public finances, tackle persistent inflation and encourage investment‑led growth, while critics inside and outside Parliament warned of a heavier burden on “working people” and potential political backlash from voters. Despite an embarrassing leak of detailed budget analysis by the OBR hours before the speech, financial markets reacted calmly, with investors buying longer‑dated UK government bonds and pushing their yields down, a sign of renewed confidence after recent turbulence in British fiscal policy.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/W7l6n2T-bd37LPhzCoW_d_X2CalRxxZlEQl6rMUhR7QA7_Sp4bm4ZaCqvyUy7CjszQqJ1FCxMXsNb-66bjzF0r9boywhavb1CX9tOA_hIupxtUSECjFKuDkJ8OLVusXoMcY_Nl2hvNPj2FkXMpj-y8HBel57BmAKcUTnvyyzL45Nm-MAuPPeHmkeEYeGo0bNDS8FAhWZ6r0ZPwc1oES1gwFi' alt='Rachel Reeves, Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, carries the traditional red budget box in London before delivering the Labour government’s first budget.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Record tax burden: The OBR projects that the overall tax take will climb to about 38% of UK GDP by 2031, the highest level in the post‑war era and significantly above recent decades’ averages.</li><li>OBR leak incident: Several hours before Reeves addressed Parliament, the Office for Budget Responsibility accidentally uploaded detailed analysis of every budget measure, meaning many specifics were known in advance and prompting criticism over the handling of sensitive fiscal information.</li><li>Market response: Investors responded positively to the deficit‑reduction focus, increasing purchases of long‑dated UK government bonds, which in turn drove yields sharply lower and signalled improved confidence in Britain’s fiscal trajectory.</li><li>Party base reaction: The budget’s commitment to higher public spending on social welfare and public services helped reassure Labour MPs and supporters that fiscal consolidation would not come solely through cuts, even as it raises taxes on middle and higher earners.</li><li>Opposition alternatives: Opposition leaders criticised the plan from different directions, with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch labelling it a “budget for benefits” while Reform UK’s Nigel Farage advocated instead for cutting public expenditure by about £20 billion a year.</li></ul><blockquote>This is a budget for growth, for stability and for public services that work. - Rachel Reeves</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Rachel Reeves and Labour government: Reeves presents the tax rises and spending increases as a deliberate strategy to restore fiscal credibility, support public services and lay foundations for stronger long‑term growth after a period of sluggish economic performance and high inflation.
