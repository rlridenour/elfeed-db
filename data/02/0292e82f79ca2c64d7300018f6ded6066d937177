<p>Back in 2023, I toyed with the relevant iOS dev tools needed to <a href="https://xenodium.com/my-custom-tesco-clubcard-pkpass">create a custom Tesco Clubcard pkpass</a>, and even showed how to <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-scan-this-qrcode">scan a QR code from our beloved Emacs</a> (of course).</p>
<p>Neither my friend <a href="https://vaarnan.com/">Vaarnan</a> nor I are strangers to the iOS ecosystem, yet we both agreed the above approach wasn't very practical (for neither devs nor the average iOS user). So we figured we should have a crack at it.</p>
<p>While there are some ready-made solutions out there, they often require downloading additional iOS apps or working through clunky web interfaces. We just wanted a simpler way to create our own Apple Wallet cards, and so <a href="https://www.kitty.cards/">Kitty Cards</a> (<a href="https://www.kitty.cards">kitty.cards</a>) was born: no app download or sign-in required.</p>

<p>Hopefully not much to explain. From <a href="https://kitty.cards">kitty.cards</a>, customize a card, press the <code>Add to Apple Wallet</code> button, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_your_uncle">Bobs your uncle</a>.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy <a href="https://www.kitty.cards/">Kitty Cards</a>!</p>
