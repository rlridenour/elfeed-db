<li>The tire inflator is ready to keep your tires, pool toys, and basketballs inflated, and also works as a power bank or a compressor for a brad nailer</li>
<li>The electric screwdriver is here to tackle any job that seems too annoying for a basic screwdriver yet not big enough for a power drill</li>
<li>Two things you’ll buy on a whim and then be unable to live without</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: We’ll have to check the screwdriver attachments, but we doubt it</li>
</ul><h1>Game Changers</h1><p>Basically, what we have here is a choice between two things you don’t strictly need but that will, nonetheless, change your life for the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fanttik-Inflator-Compressor-Inflation-Motorcycles-Yellow/dp/B09YD2D96V?th=1&tag=mehdown-20#averageCustomerReviewsAnchor">The tire inflator gets a 4.7 out of 5 on Amazon based on more than 5600 ratings</a>, and it makes sense why: because when you’re rolling around town with a tire that’s just a little low, the last thing you want to do is drag out your huge compressor or have to make an unwanted stop at a gas station to use theirs.</p>
<p>What’s more, as Amazon user ‘loving the journey!’ points out, it might not be a matter of even needing a bit more air as much as appeasing a despotic air pressure monitoring system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an absolute game-changer for us. We owned previous vehicles with compressors included, but our current vehicle does not. The tire pressure in our 2022 SUV sensor comes on at least 2-3 times per week. Dealer can’t figure it out, no luck with anything, so I keep this with us. It is fast, easy, and does the job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can also blow up bike tires, pool toys, basketballs, you name it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fanttik-S1-Cordless-Screwdriver-Furniture/dp/B0C141QZVL?tag=mehdown-20#averageCustomerReviewsAnchor">The screwdriver earns the same score of 4.7 out of 5</a>, though based on just about a thousand reviews. Among them is Franco Domingo’s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an affordable, useful product of excellent quality. There is a subtle elegance in its simplicity. Compact yet powerful, sublime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry but talking about the “subtle elegance” of an electric screwdriver and ending with “sublime” is cracking me up. Surprising there’s no reference to how using it evokes a certain <em>je ne c’est quoi</em>.</p>
<p>And yet, this review gets at the main selling point: the simplicity. It’s not as bulky as a power drill, nor is it as annoying and arduous as a basic screwdriver. Which means it’ll be your preferred tool for most jobs that fall somewhere between tightening one or two screws and mounting a shelves to the wall.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what Amazon user Jason JB Banks says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know that feeling when you buy something on a whim, and it turns out to be way more helpful than you ever expected? That’s exactly how I feel about the Fanttik S1 Pro Electric Screwdriver. I originally got it thinking it might come in handy, but now I find myself constantly reaching for it. This little powerhouse makes everything much more manageable, from assembling furniture to fixing small gadgets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They go on to lay out the other great features: controllable torque so you can be delicate or aggressive, a magnetic bit case for keeping your stuff in order, and even an LED light so you can see where to put it.</p>
<p>And we should remind you, these Amazon reviews are from people who bought this thing at an Amazon price. As in, almost 90 bucks for the screwdriver and 80 bucks for the inflator.</p>
<p>Our price, meanwhile, is $30.</p>
<p>In other words, you can do just what JB described with either of these great tools: buy one on a whim and then use it constantly.</p>
<p>So why don’t you do that? Or at least do the buying. That’s our favorite part, TBH.</p>
