If you're a Mac user with a Windows PC background, you'll probably know how to use the typical copy and paste commands in macOS. But there's a handy clipboard trick that's worth keeping in mind.<br/>

In Windows, the Copy and Paste key combinations are <strong>Control-C</strong> and <strong>Control-V</strong>, respectively. On the Mac, it's very similar – all you do is use the <strong>Command (⌘)</strong> key instead of Control. <br/>
<br/>
But did you know that you can also paste text without its original formatting? Not knowing that this is possible on a Mac, many users paste text into a plain-format text editor to strip it of any styling before copying and pasting it again to its intended destination. But you don't have to do that.<br/>

If you'd rather directly paste the copied text elsewhere as purely plain text, use the key combination <strong>Command-Option-Shift-V</strong> and it will be automatically stripped of any formatting. <br/>
<br/>
This is a system-wide shortcut, so you can use it almost anywhere in macOS that accepts text input.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/macos-copy-paste-text-without-formatting/">macOS Quick Tip: Copy and Paste Text Without Formatting</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-quick-tip-copy-and-paste-text-without-formatting.2455828/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
