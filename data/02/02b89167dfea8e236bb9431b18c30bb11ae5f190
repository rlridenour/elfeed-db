<a href="https://www.apple.com/today/camp/">Apple Camp</a> will run from June 21 through July 31 this year at Apple Store locations around the world. A part of the broader <a href="https://www.apple.com/today/">Today at Apple</a> program, the camp offers free creative programming to children ages 6-10, with parent or guardian attendance required. This year, families can learn how to make movies on an iPad using the iMovie app.<br/>

Apple's description of the Direct Your Own Friendship Film on iPad session:<blockquote>In this 90-minute experience, kids and their families are invited to explore the magic of filmmaking on iPad with iMovie. Kids will collaborate as they direct, film, edit and more to make a friendship film that celebrates how we're better when we come together. This year, campers will be split into two groups and will learn how to record video and use iMovie on iPad to create a story together inspired by friendship. The groups will use the iPad to film scenes to create a movie. They will then use the iMovie app to edit their movies and learn how to add fun sound effects, transitions, slow motion, and more.</blockquote>All children will take home an Apple Camp shirt, which has been redesigned this year and is now made from 100% recycled materials, according to Apple.<br/>

The 90-minute sessions are entirely free of charge, and Apple will provide children with an iPad to use during the sessions.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-camp/">Apple Camp</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/18/apple-camp-registration-opens-today/">Apple Camp for Kids Returns to Apple Stores This June and July</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-camp-for-kids-returns-to-apple-stores-this-june-and-july.2459246/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
