This post is about a <a href="https://mbork.pl/2025-08-04_org-copy-visible">posting by Marcin Borkowski (mbork)</a> from a couple of weeks ago that I&rsquo;ve had sitting in a browser tab since then. Sacha already covered it so I wasn&rsquo;t going to replow that ground but I kept thinking that the day would come when I would need to know how to copy some Org mode text without including the link markup. So this post is sort of a note to myself but also to anyone else who missed seeing the original or its mention in <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/08/2025-08-04-emacs-news/">Emacs News</a>.

The basic idea is that you have some Org text that contains links and you want to copy it to some<br />
inactive text where the links aren&rsquo;t live. Rather than have the link appear as <code>[[https://someplace.com][a link to some place]]</code>, you&rsquo;d like them to appear simply as <code>a link to some place</code>.
</p>
<p>
This is Org mode and Emacs so of course there is a way. Org has the command <code>org-copy-visible</code> that does just what you want. It even has a keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>v</kbd>.

You&rsquo;re probably not going to need this often but when you do, it can save a lot of tedious labor. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m recording it here so that I can find it later when I need it.</p>
