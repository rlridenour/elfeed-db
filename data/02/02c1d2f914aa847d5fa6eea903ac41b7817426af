<p>Something good happened when I got <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/04/26/im-so-used-to-watch.html">my new TV</a>. I started enjoying movies and TV shows more. I know, what a surprise, right? There are a few things at play here.</p>
<p>The apartment&rsquo;s natural darkness and quiet make it ideal for watching movies. We also got two headsets connected to it (this required a Bluetooth hub, which works great), which adds to the experience. The Sony TV&rsquo;s color depth and detail make 4K resolution really pop. And last but not least, I connected my old Mac mini to it to watch whatever movies I have saved on my backlog.</p>
<p>With all of that, I started catching up on shows and movies. For now, Nat and I started watching Severance, and I caught up on Better Call Saul, which I never followed up on; I&rsquo;m happy to see all the episodes are still on Netflix. We&rsquo;re also finishing up on the second season of Bear when we get the chance.</p>
<p>With video games I want to follow up on, movies, and books, there&rsquo;s a lot to keep track of. There are good websites for some of these things, like letterboxd for movies and backlogged for video games (and I&rsquo;m on both), and of course there&rsquo;s Micro.blog for books, but it&rsquo;s challenging to follow up media on all these different sites which are set up differently and have their own accounts - so I turned back to a suggestion I once <a href="https://appaddict.app/post/sequel-entertainment-database">read on Lou&rsquo;s blog</a>: <a href="https://www.getsequel.app">Sequel</a>.</p>
<p>Everything I want to follow on, whether a TV show (down to each episode of each season), a video game (with release dates), a book, or a movie - it&rsquo;s there. It has a beautiful interface that makes it a breeze to find and add something. Oh, and it&rsquo;s available on macOS and iOS, so I can mark the latest episode of Better Call Saul I just watched from the sofa.</p>
<p>For posts on this blog, I still need to review movies with letterboxd and games with backlogged, because the sites' RSS feeds goes directly to the blog, but Sequel is great to keep track of it all.</p>
