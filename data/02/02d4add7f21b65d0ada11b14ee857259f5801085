Apple is planning to completely change the design of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> over the course of the next three years, leading to a radically different "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 20" to celebrate the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s 20th anniversary in 2027.<br/>

Here's what's coming.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>2025</h2><br/>
In 2025, Apple plans to debut the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, a much thinner version of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Rumors suggest that it could be as thin as 5.5mm, which would make it the thinnest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date.<br/>
<br/>

Apple is prioritizing the new, slimmed down chassis over features, and there will be some compromises. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; is expected to have a single-lens camera and lower battery life because Apple has to use a thinner battery. Still, it is an all-new design, and it helps Apple start the move to slimmer smartphones.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>2026</h2><br/>
The first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is coming in 2026, and that will be the biggest change to Apple's smartphone lineup in &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; history. Over the weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/foldable-iphone-rumored-features/">shared a few more details</a> on the device, adding to what we already know.<br/>

Apple's 2026 flagship &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will fold like a book, featuring an outer display when closed and a larger interior display when open. Apple has been working to reduce the crease, so the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will look like a single piece of glass.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will have a 5.5-inch outer display and a 7.8-inch inner display. When it's unfolded, it'll be even thinner than the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;. It'll measure 4.5 to 4.8mm when open, and between 9 and 9.5mm when closed.<br/>
<br/>
There will again be compromises, with Apple dropping <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> and using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication instead. It will also be limited to a dual-lens rear camera, instead of a triple-lens setup, though there will be two front-facing cameras to make sure there's a selfie cam when it's open and when it's closed.<br/>
<br/>
The foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will be sold alongside more standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>2027</h2><br/>
For the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s 20th anniversary in 2027, Apple has big plans. You might think that the 20th anniversary &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will be a foldable device, but that's not the plan.<br/>
<br/>

Apple is working on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a wraparound display that curves around all of the edges, so there will be no bezels at all. It will look like a single piece of glass, with no squared edges and no cutouts at the front.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is preparing for the all-glass &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with the 2025 and 2026 iPhones, and with the new Liquid Glass design in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>.<br/>
