Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
When a new emperor <br></br>
took the throne, <br></br>
messengers were sent <br></br>
to the rich and powerful <br></br>
to deliver “glad tidings” <br></br>
of Caesar, who was called <br></br>
“savior and lord” and <br></br>
promised to bring <br></br>
peace to the empire <br></br>
through the power <br></br>
of his vast riches <br></br>
and his mighty armies.
</p>

 <p>
But when the King was born, <br></br>
messengers from God were sent, <br></br>
not to the rich and powerful, <br></br>
but to those too poor <br></br>
to be noticed by the empire.
</p>

 <p>
And for the first time, <br></br>
they heard glad tidings <br></br>
of good news, that peace <br></br>
would come to the world, <br></br>
not by the power of force <br></br>
but through the power of love.
</p>

 <p>
Look within my heart, Lord, <br></br>
this Christmas season.
</p>

 <p>
May what you find there <br></br>
reflect the humility <br></br>
of the ones to whom <br></br>
your messengers <br></br>
were first sent.
</p>

 <p>
And forgive me for when <br></br>
I’ve turned the celebration <br></br>
of your birth into something <br></br>
that served the empire <br></br>
more than it did your Kingdom.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
