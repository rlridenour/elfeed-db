Apple is expected to announce a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> imminently, headlining with new chips. Here are all of the new features we're expecting.<br/>
<br/>

The second-generation &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is highly likely to contain a more up-to-date chip for more advanced computational audio and improved responsiveness. The current &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is equipped with the Apple Watch Series 5's S5 chip from 2019. Apple is likely to opt for the S9 chip, which was a considerable leap forward in terms of performance, or one of its derivatives such as the S10, which is a more compact iteration of the S9. <br/>
<br/>
The S5 chip in the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is derived from Apple's A12 Bionic architecture but runs at lower clock speeds and is tuned for always-on, low-power operation, making it well-suited for tasks like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> processing and real-time audio tuning. In contrast, the S9 and S10 chips are based on the A13 chip, offering higher CPU and GPU performance, a more advanced Neural Engine, and greater efficiency per watt. <br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; will be equipped with the N1 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. The chip supports Wi-Fi 6E, which is much faster and has lower latency compared to the current &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;'s Wi-Fi 4 connectivity. Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible router.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could also bring its second-generation Ultra Wideband chip to the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; for a more reliable and lower-latency Handoff experience. The chip debuted in 2023's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 15 lineup. If present, the chip should allow far more precise spatial awareness than the current model, allowing it to detect the exact position and orientation of nearby devices within a few centimeters.<br/>
<br/>
New color options are also highly likely, but specific finishes are not yet known other than red, which was reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/05/new-homepod-mini-vision-pro-colors-rumored/">in testing</a>. The current &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; comes in Blue, Yellow, Midnight, Orange, and White. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/">says</a> that, just like the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, the new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; "will be built with Apple's new smart home ecosystem in mind." It is unclear if the next &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; will have &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; improvements. Unlike Apple's long-rumored smart home hub product, the new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is not expected to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, Apple retailer B&H started listing all &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/10/homepod-mini-discontinued-b-and-h/">as discontinued</a>. Some other retailers are also listing the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; as out of stock or on backorder, which suggests that a refresh is set to take place soon. Gurman believes that a new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/02/new-apple-tv-and-homepod-mini-launching-soon/">shouldn't be far off</a>" amid tightening inventory and planned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> refreshes. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/11/new-homepod-mini-coming-soon/">New HomePod Mini Coming Soon With These Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-homepod-mini-coming-soon-with-these-features.2470964/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
