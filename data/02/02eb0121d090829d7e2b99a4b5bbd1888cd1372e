<p>Australian police and political leaders are under scrutiny after clashes at a pro-Palestinian protest in central Sydney during a visit by Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Video circulating online appears to show officers throwing punches, using pepper spray, and dragging away people who were praying. Authorities said the protest turned violent after some people refused to leave the approved area, and police moved in to clear access for pedestrians. Police said they arrested 27 people, including 10 accused of assaulting officers. Herzog’s tightly secured visit was framed by Australian leaders as a show of solidarity with the country’s Jewish community after the deadly Bondi Beach shooting at a Hanukkah festival, while critics rallied against Israeli policy in Gaza and Australia’s handling of demonstrations. After the violence in Sydney, federal and state leaders urged calm and called for protests to remain peaceful.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/AR5oUCUsmx2kvBUNThWyHpP3WSQUcBc0-ZoIiaU0FX1FyehMDYVSV6S--rxePaualQTv6qJ-5kW7MRa7Qy8WPaD0caDXSicAZtTp8ZH5fmt6' alt='Pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrate in Sydney during Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s visit, February 9, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Legal basis for limits: Reporting said NSW tried to restrict (and in some accounts ban) the Sydney protest on hate-speech grounds, making Herzog’s visit an early test of how tightened protest rules are enforced.</li><li>Protests beyond Sydney: Organisers also mobilised rallies in Melbourne and other cities and towns during the visit, underscoring that the demonstrations were coordinated nationally, not just focused on one flashpoint.</li><li>Media caught up in dispersal: Some accounts said journalists and onlookers were caught up in the police operation, including reports of pepper spray used at close range.</li><li>Role of protest conditions: A policing law expert who attended said the NSW government’s protest conditions helped set the stage for the confrontation, and that different arrangements could have avoided clashes.</li><li>Police response defended publicly: Police rejected misconduct claims and defended their actions after videos spread online showing punches and people being dragged away.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>New South Wales Police: Police said violence broke out after some people refused to leave the planned protest site, prompting officers to clear the area.
