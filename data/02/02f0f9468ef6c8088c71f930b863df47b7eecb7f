  <p>In his piece, Gruber particularly calls out the trashcan Mac Pro
sticking at $2999 throughout its existence, but I think an even
more striking example is the iMac. Introduced in 1998 at a base
price of $1299, today’s infinitely more powerful iMac M4 starts at
… $1299.</p>

<p>Granted, with inflation, those prices would be a little different.
In researching the details, I came across <a href="https://www.perfectrec.com/posts/iMac-price-history">this great piece from
PerfectRec</a> charting the iMac’s price history over the years,
including adjusting for inflation. Impressively, while the iMac’s
base price has dipped as low as $1099 in all that time, it’s never
gone <em>over</em> $1299.</p>

<p>What a great example. And bringing inflation into the mix is a key factor I neglected to make <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/unchanging_prices_vs_nonsensical_tariffs">yesterday</a>. Moore’s Law makes computers very strange manufactured goods. A Honda Civic LX cost about $15,000 in 1998, but now costs about $25,000. BMW 3-series sedans went from around $30,000 to $45,000. But the iMac still starts at $1,299.</p>

<p>Pricing stability is a way that Apple keeps these two forces — Moore’s Law and inflation — in balance.</p>
