This is the third post in my series about writing an Emacs core in Rust. The first post laid out my initial observations and ideas about the language runtime. The second post focused on building a safe garbage collector in Rust using the type system. I initially stated that I wanted to reach the point where I could bootstrap bytecomp.el (the elisp byte compiler). That goal is reached1, so I am providing an update on my latest learnings.
