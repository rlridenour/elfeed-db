Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; is gaining a photo-to-video feature that's powered by Veo 2. The photo app will be able to generate short videos from the photos that are saved in the Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; gallery, adding subtle animations, facial expressions, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; users can select a picture from their photo gallery and choose the "Subtle movements" or "I'm feeling lucky" options to bring images to life with movement. The feature is rolling out today in the Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; apps for iOS and Android.<br/>
<br/>
In the next few weeks, Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; will get a "Remix" feature that will allow users to change the style of a photo using AI. Available options will include anime, comic, sketch, and 3D animation. The Photo to video and Remix tools can both be found in the new Create tab in Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, and all AI-generated content will be watermarked with a SynthID digital watermark.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-shorts-creation-tools-2025/">for YouTube Shorts</a>, Google is allowing creators to use the Photo to video feature to turn pictures from the camera roll into videos that work on the Shorts platform. As with the option in Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, Photo to video can add movement to landscape photos, animate everyday images, and add life to group photos.<br/>
<br/>
Creators are also able to use new effects that can transform doodles into images and turn selfies into unique videos.<br/>
<br/>
Photo to video for YouTube Shorts is rolling out today and over the next week, and it's a free feature that will be available in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The new effects are rolling out in the coming weeks and can be found by tapping the Effects icon in the Shorts camera.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/23/google-ai-features-photos-youtube/">Google Brings New Video AI Features to Google Photos and YouTube Shorts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-brings-new-video-ai-features-to-google-photos-and-youtube-shorts.2462096/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
