<p>President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a new framework at the White House on Monday to deepen cooperation on rare earths and other critical minerals, aiming to reduce US reliance on Chinese supply chains [bbc.com#1][npr.org#1][dawn.com#1]. The agreement centers on expanding mining and, crucially, processing capacity across the supply chain, with both governments positioning the pact as a way to secure inputs for clean energy, high-tech manufacturing and defense [dawn.com#1][france24.com#1][aljazeera.com#1].
