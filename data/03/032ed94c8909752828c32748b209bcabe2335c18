<p>Two oil tankers linked to Russian trade and under Western sanctions were damaged by explosions in the Black Sea off Turkey’s northern coast on Friday, prompting large-scale rescue and emergency operations by Turkish authorities. The tanker Kairos, sailing under the Gambian flag from Egypt toward Russia’s Novorossiysk port, reported an external impact before a blast caused a major fire on board, leading to the full evacuation of its 25 crew members. A second Gambian‑flagged vessel, the Virat, separately reported being struck further east, with a hole observed in its hull and heavy smoke in the engine room, though its 20 crew members initially chose to remain on board and were reported to be in good condition. Turkish officials said early assessments suggested the ships may have been hit by a drifting sea mine or other devices such as missiles or drones, and noted that commercial traffic through the nearby Bosphorus strait continued while investigations into the cause of the incidents began.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/A-dWcszaxFcKHHVYmcAmT8_fFwgoACoo6Kswkoa8O4JyBQ0dWIX-kN46UCy3xoYh_ABdlpASS36RdC9TgaxXKdNppGnDDqfedF94pcyP18fmpE1wQDvokagZnMhLDUT44-pvqoYczTMOPW1N8cE3VXTYxVXlJvW702SFneH9HBxJfHi5GM0zNy_7Mb7ZZVfiVNBwhCQMma99lN77PRVAGtOqmvqaVIXytsoHIlGS3zrGbnP2bU-82qB-gxMYKz1vJhQVtAyR0Q74' alt='Smoke rises from one of the damaged tankers in the Black Sea off Turkey’s northern coast.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Rapid rescue: Turkey’s Transport Ministry said it dispatched fast rescue boats, a tugboat, and an emergency response vessel to the Kairos immediately after the alarm, enabling the safe removal of everyone on board despite the ongoing fire.</li><li>Shadow fleet status: Shipping and market data providers classify both the Kairos and Virat among vessels targeted by Western sanctions for carrying Russian oil outside price‑cap and embargo rules introduced after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</li><li>Mine risk context: Authorities and shipping sources noted that ships in the Black Sea have hit free‑floating mines in recent years, and unexploded devices have occasionally been found drifting, underscoring ongoing navigational hazards in the region.</li><li>Ship conditions: While the Kairos suffered a large fire visible in official footage, Turkish officials reported no active fire on the Virat at the time of inspection, though damage to the hull was documented in photographs.</li><li>Traffic continuity: A local shipping agency reported that commercial traffic through the Bosphorus strait remained uninterrupted after the incidents, suggesting authorities considered the situation contained for broader maritime navigation.</li></ul><blockquote>Information received from the ship indicated a possible mine strike - Abdulkadir Uraloglu, Turkish transport minister</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Turkish Transport Ministry: The ministry emphasized that both rescue and emergency response vessels were promptly deployed and that authorities were closely tracking the fires and any potential pollution risk as the situation evolved.
