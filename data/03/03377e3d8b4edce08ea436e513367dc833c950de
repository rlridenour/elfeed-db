<p>Adobe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, Adobe announced that the company is bringing its industry
leading Adobe Premiere video editor to mobile in a powerful <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-premiere-video-editor">new
iPhone app</a> that empowers creators to make pro-quality video
on the go. The <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/app.html">Adobe Premiere mobile app</a> makes it fast,
free and intuitive for creators to edit their videos with
precision editing on a lightning-fast multi-track timeline,
produce studio-quality audio with crystal clear voiceovers and
perfectly timed AI sound effects, generate unique content and
access millions of free multimedia assets, and send work directly
to <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html">Premiere desktop</a> for fine tuning further on a larger
screen. The new mobile app offers all the video editing essentials
for free, with upgrades available for additional generative
credits and storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a little thing, but from Adobe’s press release, you’d think this new mobile version of Premiere is only available for iOS, but, as you’d hope, it’s in fact a universal app that properly supports iPadOS too. The word “iPad” doesn’t appear in Adobe’s press release.</p>
