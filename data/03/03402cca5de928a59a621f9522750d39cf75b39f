Sometimes I end up with complex window configs while working in emacs, as you see in the title image. Using Winner mode you can easily track linearly backward through your screens, &ldquo;undo&rdquo; style; but sometimes I have a set up–as when developing a system–that I want to return to frequently. It turns out you have Window Registers for this purpose, and they work well.
 window-configuration-to-register: C-x r w &lt;key&gt;  This saves it for easy reloading with C-x r j &lt;key&gt; and you&rsquo;re back where you want to be!
