<p>Worth a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/25/boring-is-what-we-wanted">re-link</a>, following up on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/06/14/sad-state-of-mac-hardware">my post yesterday</a> linking to Stephen Hackett’s “<a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/10/boring-is-what-we-wanted/">Boring Is What We Wanted</a>”, here’s Rogue Amoeba co-founder Quentin Carnicelli, writing back in 2018:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the time of the writing, with the exception of the $5,000 iMac
Pro, no Macintosh has been updated at all in the past year. Here
are the last updates to the entire line of Macs:</p>

<ul>
<li>iMac Pro: 182 days ago</li>
<li>iMac: 374 days ago</li>
<li>MacBook: 374 days ago</li>
<li>MacBook Air: 374 days ago</li>
<li>MacBook Pro: 374 days ago</li>
<li>Mac Pro: 436 days ago</li>
<li>Mac Mini: 1,337 days ago</li>
</ul>

<p>Worse, most of these counts are misleading, with many machines not
seeing a true update in quite a bit longer. While the Mac Mini
hasn’t seen an update of any kind in almost 4 years (nor, for that
matter, a price drop), even that 2014 update was lackluster. [...]</p>

<p>Rather than attempting to wow the world with “innovative” new
designs like the failed Mac Pro, Apple could and should simply
provide updates and speed bumps to the entire lineup on a much
more frequent basis. The much smaller Apple of the mid-2000s
managed this with ease. Their current failure to keep the Mac
lineup fresh, even as they approach a trillion dollar market cap,
is both baffling and frightening to anyone who depends on the
platform for their livelihood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Five years into the Apple Silicon era, and Apple is doing exactly that. The situation has completely reversed. Apple Silicon has been an utter triumph for the Mac platform.</p>
