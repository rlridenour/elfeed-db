<p>Ukraine&#x27;s justice and energy ministers stepped down this week after investigators from the National Anti‑Corruption Bureau and other agencies revealed an alleged kickback and money‑laundering scheme tied to state energy contracts, centered on a close associate of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Authorities have charged multiple people, including Zelensky&#x27;s former business partner Timur Mindich, in what investigators describe as a roughly $100 million scheme (some outlets cite figures up to $140 million); Zelensky called the allegations &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot; and ordered firings while promising sanctions for the implicated individuals. The scandal comes as Ukraine faces winter energy strains after Russian strikes on infrastructure and as Western donors — including the EU and Germany — press for transparent investigations while pledging continued support for energy security.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/He4AIgOIjHC2Z98eBaYhsKG7D1Z4ZoLSvALoRVGMlNyURzvHVgdmHGP-tyKoQpw_R2t0oucVFdlOuE7E7CSJz8pVBN8xjyC5cssyyCLPE1Z9QokRBkt5EF7o17bfHNormxIltdGrov1GTYbUJAYAUqdhkmnRgY70AGfU-t2ynlVM3DiGSSlwaBuTFcyAd1ZuWVc78qL_thVaYW0n8tFBjq93zEtVIXgzgy7Z_c0DwfGl6FPEuBwG0iG8-ich5xPD9i4DEeU2rycniaClCA' alt='President Volodymyr Zelenskiy with Ukrainian Energy Minister (file photo) at Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, February 13, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Charges filed: Ukraine&#x27;s anti‑corruption agencies charged seven people, naming Timur Mindich among the suspects in the scheme, and said investigators uncovered a money‑laundering network linked to energy procurement</li><li>Alleged mechanics: Investigators allege kickbacks of around 10–15% were demanded on contracts with state energy firms, including deals tied to Energoatom procurement</li><li>Key suspect fled: Prosecutors say Timur Mindich left Ukraine shortly before authorities searched his apartment, complicating efforts to secure evidence and detain all suspects</li><li>Donor response: Germany reiterated support for Ukraine but urged a thorough, transparent probe and announced an additional €40 million to bolster energy resilience this winter</li></ul><blockquote>They are acting very forcefully.
