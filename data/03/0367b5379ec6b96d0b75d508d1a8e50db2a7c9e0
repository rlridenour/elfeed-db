NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman on Wednesday <a href="https://x.com/NASAAdmin/status/2019259382962307393">announced</a> that NASA astronauts will soon be permitted to fly with "the latest smartphones," beginning with the SpaceX Crew-12 and Artemis II missions over the next few months.<br/>

In an email, an Apple spokesperson said this will mark the first time the iPhone has been fully qualified for extended use in orbit and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
NASA astronauts were previously not allowed to carry their own personal smartphones on space flights, but they did allow some approved DSLR cameras and other equipment. With smartphones, Isaacman said astronauts will be able to "capture special moments for their families and share inspiring images and video with the world."<br/>

It is unclear exactly which iPhone models have been qualified.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nasa/">NASA</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/06/nasa-allows-iphones-on-space-flights/">NASA Now Allowing Astronauts to Bring Their iPhones on Space Missions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nasa-now-allowing-astronauts-to-bring-their-iphones-on-space-missions.2477288/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
