</ul><h1>Water You Cleaning With?</h1><p>Cleaning your hard floors can be kinda like making coffee. By which we mean: many would argue that some of the cheapest, simplest, most “analog” option counter-intuitively produces the best results.</p>
<p>For coffee, we’re talking pour-over. You can get a pretty glass Chemex for the price of a very basic little Mr. Coffee. A plastic Melitta? Won’t even crack $10. An Aeropress. A French press. A Bialetti pot–all of them will make a cup of coffee bursting with more flavor than you’ll find combing the sands of Hamilton Beach.</p>
<p>Likewise, an old-fashioned mop, a bucket, some warm water, and a little soap? It’ll clean your floor just as well, if not better, than this “Smart Mop.”</p>
<p>But let’s return to the coffee analogy, shall we?</p>
<p>You’ll notice something if you read closely, specifically the phrase: “cup of coffee bursting with more flavor…” In other words, these contraptions are great when you’re making coffee for you and a friend.</p>
<p>But when you’re hosting your three siblings, your parents, and a few members of your extended family for Easter brunch? Suddenly, you’re gonna need someone assigned to full-time barista duty, which is a pain.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you live in a 350-square-foot studio apartment, mopping once a week isn’t such a daunting task. Nor is it if you just need to do a quick once-over in the kitchen.</p>
<p>But when you live in a home with 1500+ square feet of hard floors, it pays to have a device where you can load up a canister with water and let it rip. Because it’s better to actually clean your floors to some degree than it is to <em>think</em> about cleaning your floors fully and then decide it’s not worth the effort.</p>
<p>And, to be clear, this thing <em>will</em> do a good job. It creates 50 PSI high-pressure 280-degree steam to clean floors without the need for chemicals. Plus, it comes with 12 attachments to handle whatever floors you have (including carpeted floors and rugs).</p>
<p>Seriously. 12 attachments. These ones:</p>

<p>Our point is, it’s thorough and it’s a bit easier (and let’s be honest, a bit more fun) than getting your basic old mop out.</p>
<p>So get one, and actually clean your floors for once.</p>
