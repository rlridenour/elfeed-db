<p>On Monday morning in Peshawar, northwestern Pakistan, several suicide attackers and gunmen targeted the Federal Constabulary headquarters, a paramilitary force responsible for border and internal security near the Afghan frontier, killing at least three security personnel and injuring multiple others. Officials say one bomber detonated explosives at the main gate while other armed assailants tried to force their way into the complex, leading to an intense gun battle inside the compound. Security forces killed the remaining attackers, and authorities described the incident as a foiled attempt to cause higher casualties at a facility located in a densely populated area close to a military cantonment. The attack comes amid a wider uptick in armed assaults in Pakistan’s northwest and renewed Pakistani accusations that fighters from groups such as Jamaat-ul-Ahrar and the Pakistani Taliban use neighboring Afghanistan as a safe haven, claims Kabul has previously rejected.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/EVpezgkdtrD1LOuSO_oILDY2p0bkOvMjHsLeMfmHSPSbFuV49qWCypQeRkiXKrlS95VgKymBgRqL1iJpVnO8sSsMFwH1XgZ0LuyYgZk-WtrpEwE0LyuGmFtRJ0zjLull76XMgVDGOIFSLM140hkBHAiKg4FfBqhU4T3RGYXlww' alt='Pakistani security personnel secure the area outside the Federal Constabulary headquarters in Peshawar after the suicide attack.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Attack sequence: Police reports indicate the first suicide bomber detonated at the main entrance, after which at least two additional assailants entered the Federal Constabulary compound, opened fire, and were subsequently killed in a shootout with security personnel.</li><li>Casualty details: Across different official tallies, security agencies reported that three Federal Constabulary personnel were killed, with injury figures ranging from at least five to more than ten wounded, including some hurt by gunfire during the attempted breach.</li><li>Claim of responsibility: The armed group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, which has previously split from the Pakistani Taliban, claimed that one of its members carried out the suicide detonation outside the headquarters before accomplices tried to storm the camp.</li><li>Government response: Senior officers from the Federal Constabulary and local police launched an immediate cordon-and-search operation around the site, deployed bomb disposal and sniffer dog teams, and began an investigation to determine how the attackers reached such a high-security zone.</li><li>Regional security context: Officials and analysts note that attacks on security installations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have increased in recent months, contributing to growing diplomatic strain between Islamabad and Kabul over cross-border militancy and border management along the Afghan frontier.</li></ul><blockquote>The first suicide bomber first carried out an attack on the main entrance of the constabulary and the other one entered the compound - Unnamed senior official</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Peshawar police: Police officials emphasized that quick action by guards at the gate and responding officers prevented the attackers from reaching the morning parade assembly inside the Federal Constabulary grounds, which could have led to significantly higher casualties.
