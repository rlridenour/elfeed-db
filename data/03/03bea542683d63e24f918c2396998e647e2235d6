<p>iFixit has been at it again, and there are a few notes worth mentioning regarding the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/113171/iphone-air-teardown">teardowns of the latest iPhones</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The iPhone Air is More Durable and Repairable Than Expected</h3>



<p>One of the big questions surrounding this phone was durability, but the titanium frame appears to render it just fine on things like bend tests. Moreover, once pulled apart, you can really see that all of the components fit in the body of the phone with the rest of the space dedicated to the battery. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/113171/iphone-air-teardown">Impressive.</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The iPhone Pro Vapor Chamber Is Just Cool</h3>



<p>I expected the vapor chamber would be full of water, but it <em>turns out</em> that’s not how they work. There’s a single drop of water inside that makes it work.</p>

<p>It looks as if the sharp corner of the camera plateau is <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/113388/iphone-17-pro-teardown">susceptible to scratching</a> and losing its anodized color.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The TechWoven Case is Better than FineWoven</h3>



<p>iFixit also took <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/113198/two-years-after-the-finewoven-fiasco-is-techwoven-better">its testing techniques to the new TechWoven case</a>. In short, it&#8217;s a lot more resilient out of the box compared to FineWoven. However, taking a razor blade to it cuts through the surface treatment, which leads to trouble. It sure is a good thing I don’t keep an exposed razor blade in my pocket.</p>
