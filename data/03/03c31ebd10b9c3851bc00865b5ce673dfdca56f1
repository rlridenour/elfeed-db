<p>Stephen Hackett just <a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/06/3ghz-power-mac-g5-broken-promise/">took a deep dive</a> into the story of the Power Mac G5, which introduced the “cheese grater” design also used by many years of Intel-based Mac Pros. His piece’s title, “The Broken Promise of the 3 GHz Power Mac G5,” is a reference to the infamous guarantee Steve Jobs gave that the G5 chip would reach 3 GHz, which it never did. Instead, Apple switched to Intel. (It wasn’t the only reason—G5 laptops were also seemingly impossible—but it didn’t help.)</p>

The piece quotes “Joz and Ruby” at length, because it really was one of the most remarkable product briefings I’ve ever received.</p>
<p>Also remarkable: the only time they could do it was in the afternoon on July 3, right before everyone went off for the long Independence Day weekend. My family and I were going to spend the weekend in L.A., so my wife and 20-month-old daughter were in tow at Infinite Loop.
