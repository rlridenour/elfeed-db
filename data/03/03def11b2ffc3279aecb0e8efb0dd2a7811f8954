<p>Full disclosure: I'm a complete noob at making pizza. It's my second pizza, but hey, it was tasty and fun to make! Making pizza at home is not as far-fetched as I initially thought.</p>
<h2>UPDATES:</h2>
<p>I've made this recipe a couple of times. Made two improvements worth mentioning.</p>
<h3>Flan tin / quiche pan</h3>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/round_pie.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>My first pizzas were rectangular, matching the baking tray shape, but I really wanted round pies. I found a quiche pan at home and gave that a try. Worked pretty well. The dish bottom comes up, which is pretty handy.</p>
<h3>Double baking</h3>
<p>Bake in two stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bake the pizza for 6 minutes (without the mozarella) at bottom of oven.</li>
<li>Add mozzarella and make for 4 minutes at top of the oven.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<p>Ok, on to the recipe now…</p>
<h3>Dissolve the yeast</h3>
<ul>
<li>7g of yeast.</li>
<li>325ml of lukewarm water.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water.</p>
<h3>Mixing the dough</h3>

<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/mix2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>500g of flour.</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gradually add flour to the yeast and water mix, using the bottom of a spoon to work it until smooth (no lumps). The dough will be very sticky at first. Stay faithful to the spoon. It'll work. BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200415-how-to-make-pizza-like-a-neapolitan-master">How to make pizza like a Neapolitan master</a> has a great demo. I followed the dough technique.</p>
<h3>Kneading the dough</h3>

<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/knead2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Sprinkle some flour on the table and knead the dough (punch, stretch, and fold many times) from previous step. Eventually, the dough will hold its shape.</p>
<h3>Make 4 balls</h3>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/cut_in_four.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/four_balls.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Roll the dough into a cylinder and cut into 4 pieces. Make 4 balls.</p>
<h3>Make the tomato sauce</h3>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/garlic_slice.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/sauce_done.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>500g of passata.</li>
<li>3 cloves of garlic.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love garlic. Who doesn't? Slice the garlic finely and combine with the passata in a class jar. Shake it a little. Garlic and passata. That's your sauce.</p>
<h3>Cover for 2 hours</h3>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/put_away.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/after_hours.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Place the 4 dough balls into a container and cover with a damp cloth for 2 hours. You can make 4 pizzas.</p>
<p><em>*Rookie mistake: I should have used a bigger container. The balls grew and merged.</em></p>
<h3>Preheat oven</h3>
<p>Preheat the oven at 250°C.</p>
<h3>Stretch base</h3>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/stretch.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Sprinkle more flour on table prior to shaping the dough. Place ball on table, flatten. Flip over, flatten again. Gradually stretch until you have the shape and thickness desired.</p>
<h3>Place base on baking tray</h3>
<ul>
<li>Semolina</li>
<li>Aluminium foil</li>
</ul>
<p>Line up the tray with some aluminium foil. Before transferring the base on to the baking tray, sprinkle semolina (or breadcrumbs) on the foil (it helps prevent the dough from sticking).</p>
<h3>Toppings</h3>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/oiled.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/parmesan.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/mozarella.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Tomato sauce.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
<li>Olive oil.</li>
<li>Parmesan cheese.</li>
<li>125g of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
<li>Fresh basil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spread some of the tomato sauce with a spoon. Sprinkle salt, olive oil, and parmesan cheese. Break the mozzarella into pieces and spread throughout. Add some basil leaves. Your basic margherita pizza is now ready for the oven.</p>
<h3>Bake pizza</h3>
<p>Place the tray in the oven for 10 minutes. This worked for my oven, which goes up to 250°C. Either way, keep an eye on it.</p>
<h3>Post baking toppings</h3>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/final.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Anchovies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Controversial, but I really like anchovies. Add them post-baking and you're good to go. Enjoy your pizza.</p>
