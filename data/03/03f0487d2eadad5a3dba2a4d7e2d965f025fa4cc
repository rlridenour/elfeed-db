<p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing US agencies to examine whether specific branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan should be designated as foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists under American law. The White House fact sheet describes the Brotherhood as a transnational network whose local chapters allegedly support or engage in violence and destabilisation campaigns against US partners, citing activities such as rocket fire from Lebanon during the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel and claimed material backing to Hamas from Jordanian affiliates. The order, signed in Washington on November 24, triggers a formal, multi-step review led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, including a report due within a set timeframe on whether these chapters meet US legal criteria for sanctions and terrorism listings. While some countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan already outlaw or restrict the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist or banned organisation, the new US process could add financial sanctions and travel restrictions, potentially reshaping Washington’s relations with regional Islamist movements and governments that either oppose or tolerate them.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/I9b-y9TN5UAIwECVaQufckJRuIXMqnNLLoNKE7zbA0mPYfuS6Ft3rGshvCAw0VRwJUtjWpo--pknrKBD__CgJaSMJwvdcsggSB4QEm6InzY-' alt='President Trump speaks at an international summit in Asia earlier in 2025, as his administration now moves to review certain Muslim Brotherhood branches for possible US terrorism designations.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Targeted branches: The order explicitly instructs officials to focus their review on Brotherhood-linked organisations in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan, rather than the global movement as a whole, leaving open the possibility that some national chapters may not be designated even if others are.</li><li>Legal tools: If any chapters are listed, they would become both foreign terrorist organisations and specially designated global terrorists under US law, enabling asset freezes, criminal penalties for material support, and wide-ranging financial restrictions on associated individuals and entities.</li><li>Regional examples: The White House materials allege that the Lebanese chapter’s military wing fired rockets alongside Hamas and Hezbollah during the 2023 Israel-Gaza war, that an Egyptian Brotherhood leader called for violent attacks on US partners, and that Jordanian leaders have long aided Hamas’s militant wing.</li><li>Implementation timeline: President Trump ordered his cabinet to deliver a report within roughly 30 days outlining whether Muslim Brotherhood chapters in the named countries meet the statutory tests for terrorism designations, after which he can decide on formal listings and sanctions.</li><li>Policy objective: The executive order states that it is US policy to work with regional partners to weaken and, where possible, eliminate the operational capabilities of Brotherhood-linked groups that Washington determines are supporting violence against American interests and allies.</li></ul><blockquote>President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood’s transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East - White House fact sheet</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House: The administration characterises the Muslim Brotherhood as a cross-border network whose chapters in several Middle Eastern countries allegedly enable violence and destabilisation against US partners, and says the new review is designed to curb that influence through possible sanctions and terrorism listings.
