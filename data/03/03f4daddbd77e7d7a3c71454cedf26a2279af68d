With Qi2.2 accessories, compatible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models can charge at up to 25W, a wireless charging speed that is comparable to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> 2 25W charging speeds supported by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. Standard Qi2 wireless chargers max out at 15W, so the new accessories that are coming out with Qi2.2 provide faster wireless charging while using the same magnetic attachment system.<br/>
<br/>
Scosche says that its MagicMount charging options include a StickGrip suction base for securing to windows or dashboards, a flip-arm extension for deep dashboards or close-up viewing, and a 360-degree ball-joint mount head for adjustability.<br/>
<br/>
There are four mounting options available for the MagicMount Charge Pro, including the &#36;60 Dash/Vent Mount, the Window/Dash Mount, the Flip Window/Dash Mount, and a 5-in-1 Mount. The Dash/Vent Mount is available now, while the other options will launch in October.<br/>
<br/>
Scosche is also highlighting the &#36;30 FoundIT 32W Car Charger with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> integration so that it doesn't get lost, the &#36;70 15W Charge Pro Desk Mount, and the &#36;50 MagicMount Flask, which has a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; lid that can double as an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; stand.<br/>
