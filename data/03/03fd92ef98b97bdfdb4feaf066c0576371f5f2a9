<p>A French court on Friday sentenced Dahbia Benkired to life imprisonment without possibility of early release for the rape and murder of 12-year-old Lola Daviet in Paris in 2022, making her the first woman in France to receive the maximum whole-life term . The presiding judge pointed to the &quot;extreme cruelty&quot; of the acts and the lasting psychological damage to the victim&#x27;s family when handing down the sentence . The case provoked intense public debate about immigration and deportation because Benkired had overstayed her visa, and investigators found the girl&#x27;s body in a trunk in the lobby of the building where her parents worked as caretakers .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/tSBzHyEt0Z2bd0qpZTJsUd_2etU9XI4gmbN_wourGQBBEJ58ipgxndkj3YrPxsasfi3X-0QQCJvn7gP9fL8k3-IEvAt8siAKdh8GT5sVkR6F5xH1agHCja__anGUjHIsfEABJoa9tPBIkMCOeu4qNoQKgFtKNsf9rK0Wqy7zF1ZDLyl2tp2aJO_SjQRwsAr5GtCVlS5aYzY' alt='A commemorative event for Lola Daviet in Fouquereuil, northern France, on Tuesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Legal milestone: Judges imposed an &quot;irreducible life sentence,&quot; the harshest penalty under the French penal code that does not allow parole or early release, establishing a rare legal precedent for a woman in France</li><li>Prosecutor&#x27;s case: The public prosecutor had argued explicitly for an irreducible life term, telling the court the sentence must reflect the &quot;extreme gravity&quot; and cruelty of the crimes committed</li><li>Psychiatric findings: Three psychiatric experts who examined the defendant reported &quot;psychopathic&quot; tendencies and concluded she did not suffer from a treatable mental health condition that would warrant reduced responsibility</li><li>Community response: A commemorative event for Lola was held in Fouquereuil as local residents and the family marked her death and the court outcome, illustrating the case&#x27;s deep community impact</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Public prosecutor: The prosecutor argued the sentence should be irreducible because the punishment must reflect the &quot;extreme gravity,&quot; cruelty and the suffering caused to the victim&#x27;s family.
