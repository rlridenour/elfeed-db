The next-generation low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> will use Apple's A19 chip, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3007341/2026-ipads-revealed-a19-base-model-m4-air-with-apples-n1-chip-coming-soon.html">Macworld</a></em>. <em>Macworld</em> claims to have seen an "internal Apple code document" with information about the 2026 &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup.<br/>

Prior documentation discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> suggested that the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 12 would be equipped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/ipad-mini-a19-pro-chip/">with an A18 chip</a>, not an A19 chip. The A19 chip was just released this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">in the iPhone 17</a>, and it would be unusual for Apple to use a current-generation chip in the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; due to cost.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's most affordable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has not had a current-generation chip since the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 4, which is back when Apple was still designing AX chips for its tablet lineup. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 5 that came out in 2017 used the A9 chip that was originally introduced in the 2015 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 6s, and since then, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has been equipped with an A-series chip that's a generation or two behind the chip in the most recently released &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 11 that was released in March 2025 uses the A16 chip that first debuted in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 in 2022, for example. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 10 (October 2022) used the A14 (September 2020), the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 9 (September 2021) used the A13 (September 2019), and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 8 (September 2020) used the A12 (September 2018). A 2024 A18 chip for the 2026 &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; would be in line with prior launches.<br/>
<br/>
The model numbers listed in <em>Macworld</em>'s report are also unusual. It says that J581 and J588 are the codenames for the upcoming 12th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, but codenames are typically sequential. Codenames are how Apple references unreleased devices in its software. In prior code leaks, J581 and J582 appeared to reference the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 12.<br/>
<br/>
Prior leaks have suggested that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> will use the A19 chip, but the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; was previously referenced in Apple code as J510 and J511. Apple sometimes changes its plans and makes updates to unreleased devices, so the A19 chip for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; can't be ruled out entirely.<br/>
<br/>
It is not yet clear if <em>Macworld</em> is correct about the A19 chip for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; given previous information, but other parts of the report seem more in line with expectations. <em>Macworld</em> suggests the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> will use an M4 chip, and that both the upcoming &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will be equipped with Apple's N1 networking chip.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; typically gets an M-series chip that's a generation behind the chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, and since it's been updated to the M5, the M4 makes sense for the next &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Apple has also been adding the new N1 networking chip to newly released devices, starting with this year's iPhones. The N1 chip is an Apple-designed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip that's more energy efficient than chips designed by third-party companies.<br/>

Apple is expected to release the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models early in 2026.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/10/ipad-12-a19-chip/">iPad 12 Rumored to Get iPhone 17&#039;s A19 Chip, Breaking Apple Tradition</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-12-rumored-to-get-iphone-17s-a19-chip-breaking-apple-tradition.2474489/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
