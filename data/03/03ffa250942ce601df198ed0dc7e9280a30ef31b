&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; Software 26 adds support for crossfade, a feature that's designed to more smoothly transition between songs. It also includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> improvements, with Apple's release notes available below.<br/>
<blockquote>Software version 26 includes support for crossfade with Apple Music and AirPlay improvements. This update also includes bug fixes and stability improvements.<br/>
<br/>
- Crossfade on HomePod smoothly transitions between songs by fading out the currently playing song while fading in the next so the music never stops.<br/>
- When using AirPlay to play audio on HomePod, you can now ask Siri on HomePod to play to another HomePod speaker in your home.</blockquote><br/>
