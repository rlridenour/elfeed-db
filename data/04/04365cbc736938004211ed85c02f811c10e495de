The Unix story is well known to most software nerds but lessor known is the story of Unix v4. To many, it&rsquo;s just another in the long line of Bell Lab&rsquo;s Computing Sciences Research Center&rsquo;s Unix releases but it turns out to be special.

The original Unix was famously implemented in assembly language on an abandoned PDP-7 by Ken Thompson. As the project progressed other Bell Labs engineers joined the effort. Eventually it was realized that writing the system in a higher order language would improve the development effort but the Lab&rsquo;s go to language for such things at the time was B, which was not up to the task. Dennis Ritchie solved that problem by extending B into the C language, which was specifically designed for the Unix system.

Version 4 of Unix was the first version in which most of the system, including the kernel, was written in C. It was a turning point in the design of operating systems and computer science in general. Sadly, the system was lost and only bits of the manual survive.

Until now. A week ago, it was announced on the <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/">The Unix Heritage Society&rsquo;s mailing list</a> that a tape labeled “UNIX Original From Bell Labs V4 (See Manual for format).” had been found in a storage room at the University of Utah. There&rsquo;s a great story about it <a href="https://ponderwall.com/index.php/2025/11/09/unix-lost-tape/">on Ponderwall</a>.

Most younger nerds have probably never seen a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-track_tape">9 track tape</a> but they were the main storage medium back when Unix was first being developed. Like all magnetic tape, they deteriorate over time, especially if they aren&rsquo;t maintained in a controlled environment. For that reason, it&rsquo;s unclear if the tape can be read. It&rsquo;s being hand delivered to the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a>, which has specific expertise in recovering data from old media. Let&rsquo;s hope that they succeed and that this important part of our heritage can be recovered.</p>
