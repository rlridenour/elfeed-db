<blockquote>
  <p>Google’s Pixel 10 launch event is just under a month away, but the
company is already revealing the official design of the base
phone. You can currently see a video of the phone <a href="https://store.google.com/magazine/google_pixel_10">on Google’s
website</a> (and below). It looks just like the official renders that
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/710809/google-pixel-10-leaked-official-renders-third-telephoto-camera">leaked earlier today</a>, which showed that the phone will have a
third back camera (which is rumored to be a telephoto sensor).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s certainly one way to deal with leaks. It looks like a Pixel 9, which looks like an iPhone 12–16 with a different (but cool) camera mesa.</p>
