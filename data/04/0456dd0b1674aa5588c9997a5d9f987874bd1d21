<blockquote>
  <p>Jimmy Kimmel’s broadcast return scored big in the ratings.</p>

<p>Tuesday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” averaged 6.2 million
viewers, according to preliminary figures from Nielsen. That is
nearly four times bigger than his usual audience, even though more
than 20 percent of ABC affiliates boycotted the show.</p>

<p>The preliminary Nielsen figures are expected to grow in the coming
days as more data comes in. It does not include streaming
viewership.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1tjh_ZO_tY">Kimmel’s monologue last night</a> was a masterpiece. Watch it, I implore you.</p>

<p>Donald Trump, today, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115256938634035559">on his blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The
White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something
happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and
his “talent” was never there. Why would they want someone back who
does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in
jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE. He is yet
another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that
would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re
going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I
went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds
even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot
in his bad Ratings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn’t sound like a mob boss at all. And remember, the Republicans were the party that spent all of last year’s election cycle proclaiming to be the party of “free speech”, and opposed to “cancel culture”. Just sheer projection.</p>

<p>The way to deal with bullies is to stand up to them. Give them your lunch money once, they’ll keep coming back for more.</p>
