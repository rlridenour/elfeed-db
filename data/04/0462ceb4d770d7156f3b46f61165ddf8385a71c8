<div>  <p>If you don't actively use Emacs's <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html"><code>customize</code></a> functionality, it can be frustating when Emacs changes the <code>custom-set-variables</code> block in your init file. For example, when version controlling your init file, you have to skip over these diffs.</p>  <p>So, instead of letting customize make changes to your init file, we can redirect it elsewhere.</p>  <pre><code class="code-emacs-lisp">(setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")(when (file-exists-p custom-file)  (load custom-file))</code></pre>  <p>Because none of your other config will go there, it can be safely added to your <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">version</a> <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/.hgignore">control's</a> <a href="https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.advanced.props.special.ignore.html">ignore</a> <a href="http://darcs.net/Using/Configuration#boring">file</a>. Even though it won't bother your VCS, it will still be loaded by Emacs, on the off chance you want anything set by customize.</p>  <p>Personally, I prefer to not use customize at all, because changes in it pop up at what appear to be random times. In addition, I often want to annotate or group my configuration, which is harder to do with customize. So when I make changes to my Emacs config, I prefer to do it in Lisp code in my init file.</p>  <p>Or, if you're <a href="http://www.easydamus.com/lawfulevil.html">lawful evil</a>, you could set the <code>custom-file</code> variable with <code>M-x customize</code>.</p></div>
