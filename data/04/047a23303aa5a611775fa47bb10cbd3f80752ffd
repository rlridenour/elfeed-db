<blockquote>
  <p>When pressed about what Apple’s investments in movies and TV shows
have meant for the company as a whole, Cook explains that Apple is
at heart “a toolmaker,” delivering computers and other devices
that enable creativity in users. (This vision for the company, and
the “toolmaker” term specifically, was first articulated by Jobs
in the early 1980s.) “We’re a toolmaker,” Cook says again. “We
make tools for creative people to empower them to do things they
couldn’t do before. So we were doing lots of business with
Hollywood well before we were in the TV business.</p>

<p>“We studied it for years before we decided to do [Apple TV+]. I
know there’s a lot of different views out there about why we’re
into it. We’re into it to tell great stories, and we want it to be
a great business as well. That’s why we’re into it, just plain and
simple.” [...]</p>

<p>Media analysts and observers have wondered how the content side of
Apple threads together with the hardware sales that fuel the core
business. As Cook sees it, that’s not the point, although such
connections are emerging organically in the course of doing
business, as evidenced by “F1” and the camera tech. “I don’t have
it in my mind that I’m going to sell more iPhones because of it,”
Cook says. “I don’t think about that at all. I think about it as a
business. And just like we leverage the best of Apple across
iPhones and across our services, we try to leverage the best of
Apple TV+.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple TV+ has been killing it with original shows. Maybe with <em>F1</em> they can start bringing that magic to movies.</p>
