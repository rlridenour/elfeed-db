<p>As a kid I loved Richard Scarry’s books. As an adult I loved (and love) Chris Ware’s graphic novels. As a parent I loved reading Scarry’s books, again, with my son. So of course this essay from Ware, commemorating <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Richard-Scarrys-Cars-Trucks-Things/dp/0593706307?tag=df-amzn-20">the 50th anniversary edition of Scarry’s <em>Cars and Trucks and Things That Go</em></a>, hit hard for me. Bet it will for you too.</p>
