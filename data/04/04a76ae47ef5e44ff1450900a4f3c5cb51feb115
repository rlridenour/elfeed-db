<li>A spatula and some tongs with lights in them</li>
<li>You can remove the lights for cleaning or to use separately</li>
<li>You could probably use them for cooking during the winter too</li>
<li>Are they Mac-compatible: Yes, the tongs are great for picking up Apple products, so you don’t soil them with your greasy hands</li>
</ul><h1>Tools, In Time</h1><p><strong>How to winterize your grill:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clean your grill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the new set of grill tools with built-in lights you got from Meh and set them inside your grill so you don’t forget where they are at the start of grilling season next year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your grill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put a cover on your grill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roll your grill up a mountain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a cave for your grill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roll your grill deep into the cave, so it can hibernate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go about your winter, checking on your grill occasionally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the cover off and some char on your grill during one of your checks, indicating that it has been used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait outside the cave all day and all night to see who disturbed your winterized grill’s long slumber.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When no one comes, go back into the cave and find even more signs of grill use than before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realize what this means: that whoever used your grill didn’t come from <em>outside</em> the cave; they came from deeper <em>within</em> it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hide around a bend in the cave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you hear the grill lighting up, peek around to see who it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe a bear making hot dogs, using the tool sets’ built-in lights to see when each dog is done in the darkness of the cave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think, <em>Am I on an episode of <em>Man vs. Wild</em>, because that sure looks like Bear Grills!</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh god, it’s too funny. You’re laughing. The bear has heard you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to remember the rhyme about what to do in the event of a bear encounter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shit, just forget it and run!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bear is running after you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try not to trip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dammit, you tripped!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look up at the bear looming over you as it opens its mouth and roars… only… it sounds like the alarm on your phone?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wake up and rejoice: it was only a dream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the grill spatula under your pillow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spin it on its handle like a top to see if you’re still dreaming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch as it spins and spins.</p>
</li>
</ol>
