Last week, Apple introduced a <a href="http://tv.apple.com/">special offer on Apple TV+</a>, allowing customers a chance to get the service for just &#36;2.99 per month for three months. This offer is still live today, but it will expire for good tomorrow, April 24.<br/>

<br/>
Only new and qualified returning customers can gain access to this offer. After the three month period ends, your subscription will return to the regular pricing of &#36;9.99 per month.<br/>

<br/>
The offer is available in the Apple TV app, and at <a href="http://tv.apple.com/">tv.apple.com</a>, through April 24. Unfortunately, existing subscribers are not eligible to receive the discount.<br/>
<br/>
The promotion is running in other countries, too. In Canada, for example, the special price is set at &#36;3.99 per month. In the U.K., it is set at £2.99.<br/>
<br/>
With an Apple TV+ subscription, you can watch all of Apple's original shows and films. You can also watch select MLB and MLS games with weekly Friday Night Baseball and Sunday Night Soccer doubleheaders, at no additional cost.<br/>
