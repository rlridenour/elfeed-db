<p>President Donald Trump shared a viral image on Truth Social styled like a Wikipedia page that labeled him the “Acting President of Venezuela” as of January 2026. The post came amid heightened U.S. attention on Venezuela following what Time described as the “stunning arrest” of President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month. Multiple outlets noted the image was not an authentic Wikipedia entry, and Trump’s actual Wikipedia page does not list that role. The episode has largely played out online, but it lands as Washington and Caracas tentatively explore renewed diplomatic contact, according to Time.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/nT2G-ryLp84vN8OKyZjFR2yjEC7X2kxpXIEGUmEYZ4sqgU9-eh3vbrfXcr0ITsTc-qh3M7vxLwuoeSDRTuyVvw0XHtp1RVQNO0PiSn2Xplszx4lLNS-CpobSyiTWKYOkJXFpMX5jvstTOUed0zJwq-5PaeTjn6_OfMvjABi-sIBh6JZGYGgJ' alt='President Donald Trump, pictured in a recent portrait-style photo used in coverage of the Truth Social post.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Interim leadership: Time reports that Delcy Rodríguez—Venezuela’s vice president and oil minister—was sworn in as Venezuela’s interim president on Jan. 5.</li><li>Diplomatic opening: Time says the Caracas government under Rodríguez began exploring a process to restore diplomatic ties with Washington on Jan. 9, after those ties were severed during Trump’s first presidential term in 2019.</li><li>Embassy assessment: Time reports the U.S. State Department said a small U.S. diplomatic delegation visited Venezuela to preliminarily assess reopening the U.S. Embassy in Caracas.</li><li>U.S. pressure: Time reports the Trump administration has backed Rodríguez while warning she would “pay a very big price” if she does not meet U.S. demands.</li><li>Online context: Time notes that memes had circulated about Secretary of State Marco Rubio holding multiple “acting” roles, setting the stage for Trump’s “acting president” joke-style post.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: Trump presented himself as Venezuela’s “Acting President” in a Truth Social post using a fake Wikipedia-style image.
