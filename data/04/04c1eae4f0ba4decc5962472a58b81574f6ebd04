<p>My love for plain text has evolved to the point that as a non-programmer, I am happily tracking <a href="https://medium.com/@miscellaneplans/how-i-get-instant-access-to-the-four-text-files-that-run-my-life-26336eb22414" target="_blank">time, tasks, and notes</a> in monospaced type. And all in documents that <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Douglas-Engelbart" target="_blank">Douglas Engelbart</a> could have read in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Ah, the good old days! And <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/09/resilience-through-practical-skills" title="wikilink">the good old ways</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-good-ol-tried-and-tested-ways">The good ol‘ — tried and tested&nbsp;— ways</h3>
<p>The best of the old ways are valuable not because they’re old, but because they are tried and tested. They work. Sometimes they are equal or superior to the new ways, sometimes they’re less efficient. But efficiency isn’t <em>always</em> the goal, is it?</p>
<p>We can aim for productivity, efficiency, output, automation. Getting more output for less effort. Or we can focus on mindfulness, intentionality, interoperability, community. Getting more satisfaction for whatever effort is needed.</p>
<p>Consider what you are optimising for. What is your <a href="https://practicalpkm.com/changing-your-default-currency/" target="_blank">default currency</a>?</p>
<h3 id="keeping-your-most-important-information-under-your-control">Keeping your most important information under <em>your</em> control</h3>
<p>Many jobs require the use of specialised software to store information.</p>
<p>In the digital world, I keep my most important information in plain text. Plain text means just keystrokes, with no unique formatting (requiring software you can’t ever really own or control) needed to access your data.</p>
<p>I don’t expect to lose access to the work I’ve created in proprietary apps like Affinity Designer, but I’ll be continuing to export all my&nbsp;.afdesign files into <span class="small-caps">PDF</span> format anyway.</p>
<p>Resources I created 20 years ago in early versions of InDesign are now completely inaccessible. I didn’t convert them soon enough, and there’s now no way to open them. Simple Saveback? IDML? Nope. I no longer need those files, thankfully.</p>
<p>Files I saved back then in TextEdit? Yup! Still perfectly accessible today.</p>
<h3 id="the-bigger-picture">The bigger picture</h3>
<p>This is about more than file formats. It’s about the richness of human knowledge, and who we are without all that tech.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is reducing the need to learn things that once took many hours of study. As a result, some human-learned skills are worth more! You can’t fudge human influence, intuition, and connection, with all its unpredictable flaws and unintentional genius.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Writing, speaking, becoming fluent in multiple languages — <span class="small-caps">AI</span> is offering us an escape hatch from the hard work of getting better at fundamental human skills. …The question isn’t whether we should use these tools — of course we should. The question is which human skills are still worth the investment to develop ourselves.” —Nathan Barry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take stock for a minute. What are you outsourcing, that people in times past had to do for themselves? What do you have and what are you cultivating within yourself that doesn’t require constant connectivity or specialised software?</p>
<h3 id="old-skills-for-a-new-age">Old skills for a new age</h3>
<p>What I want is not a move away from modern technology, to the old ways; I’m seeking a mindset that can use the former without losing touch with the latter.</p>
<p>It looks something like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shop online, but also go to the local farmer’s markets</li>
<li>Use Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Affinity, Adobe, but keep up to date copies of the raw text and graphics in open formats like&nbsp;.txt,&nbsp;.pdf,&nbsp;.png</li>
<li>Watch Netflix and enjoy gaming, but also have no-tech hobbies that help you relax</li>
<li>Enjoy online interactions on forums and social media, but also cultivate relationships in your local community</li>
<li>Read ebooks, but keep physical copies of the best of them</li>
<li>Organise the photos on your phone, but print a curated set of the memories you’d hate to lose</li>
<li>Use translation apps to help you communicate, but also start learning a language you admire <em>and</em> your country’s sign language alphabet</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="putting-it-into-practice">Putting it into practice</h3>
<p>You don’t need to do everything, but maybe you can pick one or two no-tech skills. Piece by piece, one spare minute at a time, skills accumulate!</p>
<p>Currently I’m enjoying learning how to fingerspell in Auslan so I can communicate with people in my local deaf community. Friends and family in my area freely use their skills to help each other. People in my local church congregation who have excess garden produce leave it on a table for anyone to take.</p>
<p>The goal isn’t to reject modern tools and practices, it’s to make sure you aren’t entirely dependent on them.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, most systems fail. Backups plus <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/09/resilience-through-practical-skills" title="wikilink">traditional knowledge</a> can keep you grounded when things take a downward turn.</p>
