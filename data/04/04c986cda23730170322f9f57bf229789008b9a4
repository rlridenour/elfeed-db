<p>TikTok reached a last-minute settlement in a California lawsuit alleging its platform’s design contributed to harmful addiction, avoiding a jury trial that was about to begin in Los Angeles. The case is part of broader litigation accusing major social platforms of building addictive features that damage young people’s mental health, with the trial proceeding against Meta’s Instagram and Google’s YouTube. While settlement terms were not disclosed, the agreement narrows the immediate courtroom fight and could still shape how courts and policymakers worldwide scrutinize youth-focused product design and online safety.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/AzD_TdZ8RpxGoFe-7zyH5raBnmxWLXOSn-dFh7hxWZBE1aTIDU3YcDHXI811nHVGknAHzsb4NxMdgkD4XPlPs6l92Fcf_rwoPyXKfx6A0ltmf8SKpjliN4nn183CZhOECOB9yPkNRu2Ur6qkP89Lkut_krTOgU5yw7ZMcDUc0AGyy03UG27lf__b92HuIY7fG78xoEKfMlHMqWzV8Swnd_qzgUzG5Lu3hGPUviYWJkRgHBmcGoxGyRxngma7CZ97HrBxILCpltiO4cM4OQ' alt='File photo of TikTok signage outside offices in Culver City, California, as reporting says the company reached an eleventh-hour deal to avoid a US trial over youth addiction claims.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who sued: According to the reporting, a teen plaintiff identified as “KGM” and her mother alleged the companies knowingly built addictive features that harmed her mental health and contributed to self-harm and suicidal thoughts.</li><li>Other settlement: Snapchat parent Snap Inc. settled the same case earlier for an undisclosed amount, leaving Meta and YouTube as the remaining defendants heading to a jury trial.</li><li>Trial focus: The courtroom battle is expected to test claims that product design and recommendation systems can be engineered to keep minors engaged, as the wider debate over children’s screen time and mental health intensifies.</li><li>TikTok still sued: Plaintiff counsel said TikTok remains a defendant in other personal injury cases even after settling this particular lawsuit.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Plaintiff’s attorneys: They said TikTok settled just before jury selection and that the trial will continue against Meta and YouTube, while TikTok remains a defendant in other injury cases.
