<p>A clip from this 2016 interview with Marco Rubio — then a candidate for the Republican presidential primary, today Trump’s secretary of state — by CNN’s Jake Tapper is making the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@keithedwards/post/DHBlR9sh7q4">rounds</a> on <a href="https://x.com/jason_kint/status/1898914327882551312">social</a> media. It’s extraordinary. I’m linking here <a href="https://youtu.be/0J08atDFR2c?t=476">to the full video</a>, hosted on Rubio’s own YouTube account (for now — watch for this to go down the memory hole) starting at the 7:54 mark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tapper:</strong> You compared Donald Trump to a third world dictator
yesterday in an interview with The New York Times. How so?</p>

<p><strong>Rubio:</strong> Well, I don’t know about a dictator. I said a third
world strong man. You know, he’s running for president. So no
matter what, he won’t be a dictator unless our republic completely
crumbles, which I don’t anticipate it will. But, yeah, here’s what
happens in many countries around the world: You have a leader that
emerges and basically says, <em>Don’t put your faith in yourselves.
Don’t put your faith in society. Put your faith in me. I’m a
strong leader, and I’m going to make things better — all by
myself.</em> This is very typical. You see it in the third world. You
see it a lot in Latin America for decades. It’s basically the
argument he’s making. That he, single-handedly, is going to turn
the country around. We’ve never been that kind of country.</p>

<p>We have a president. The president is an American citizen who
serves for a period of time, constrained by the constitution and
the powers vested in that office. The president works for the
people, not the people for the president. And if you listen to the
way he describes himself and what he’s going to do, he’s going to
single-handedly do this and do that without regard for whether
it’s legal or not.</p>

<p>Look, I think people are going to have to make up their mind. I
can tell you this. No matter what happens in this election, for
years to come, there are many people on the right, in the media,
and voters at large that are going to be having to explain and
justify how they fell into this trap of supporting Donald Trump,
because this is not going to end well one way or the other. He’s
going to be the nominee, and he’s going to lose. Or, he’ll have
thrown this party into its most chaotic and divisive period ever.
And that’s unfortunate because the Republican Party is the home of
the limited government free enterprise movement in America. And if
it crumbles or divides or it splits apart, it’ll be very difficult
to elect candidates that hold those views at any level of
government until we can bring the party back together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Breathtakingly prescient and succinct.</p>
