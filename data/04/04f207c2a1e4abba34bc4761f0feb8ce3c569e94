<p>Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi said a Chinese attack on Taiwan that threatened Japan’s survival &quot;could trigger a military response,&quot; prompting Beijing to sharply condemn the comment and move to suspend imports of Japanese seafood. Chinese officials framed the suspension as a justified response to interference and warned Tokyo that &quot;further measures&quot; could follow if the comments are not retracted, marking a rapid deterioration in bilateral ties. The development carries both diplomatic and economic implications: it revives a 2023 import ban precedent and signals Beijing’s readiness to use trade levers to press political aims, while casting uncertainty over Japan-China relations and regional security messaging.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/rIFVqipdWOHQGeR0bryYykF8PECE01SS5xjU63aQQcl0xqyc7pv3TFLY8bemgr-QVfrSxx261fDPW0cQIq3XWFqtKTWm9rbH2G_9vtzpHmj938mnCo6guwudP6ClGZ3kMUbN02_4fN7WW2kiT6pqPD7XbhWJwXJxSG4foiyftIs2TauxGT9FKmOEPoEHgg0hHrBgs8yawU15qwjNdtqcrfn-klVTNKdvX1jSXwQykbLkl6tC-d5OTJI_XfcDO7YlxQ2ZSMQ' alt='Japanese seafood on display; imports face suspension amid diplomatic row' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Reimposed ban: Beijing’s move reportedly reimposes a 2023 restriction on Japanese seafood imports, reviving an earlier trade penalty against Tokyo</li><li>Signal to Washington: Commentators say China’s combined economic and military posture over the dispute is intended partly to send a message to the United States about regional security dynamics</li><li>Domestic debate in Japan: Analysts and opinion pieces argue Takaichi’s language represents a strategic shift from Japan’s post‑war pacifist stance and has fuelled domestic and regional concern over military rhetoric</li><li>Initial reporting: Japanese outlets Kyodo News and NHK first reported the suspension and Beijing’s response before wider international coverage appeared</li></ul><blockquote>No market for Japanese seafood in the current climate - Chinese foreign ministry</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Chinese foreign ministry: Beijing said Takaichi’s remarks undermined the political foundation of China–Japan relations and that China had &quot;every reason to respond&quot; and might take &quot;further measures&quot;.
