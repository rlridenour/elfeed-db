<p>The Trump administration has outlined a “New Gaza” reconstruction vision—presented in Davos as part of launching President Trump’s “Board of Peace”—that depicts a rebuilt Gaza with waterfront skyscrapers, luxury housing, and major infrastructure like a port and airport. The plan is pitched as a post-war, free-market redevelopment model, even as reporting notes continued violence and strains around the ceasefire on the ground. Coverage also highlights skepticism from Palestinians and analysts who question feasibility, governance, and whether the vision reflects local needs and realities.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fd49bqfSU8e36jBfqMOgh7XKPh4uXMMOpncBT6tKAS-zAKp9dJFYIvPREM9AaBn74-JA1_1UqqCceeepBUJeRSNa5w9Cfx8W-3Zd_YCdHTUv1RL_S-CsXK80z5VK-J2mEIjNdmr8GsBPOox954sp9l7DrSFTbBZMKII7o_MbplYb830FaT3Lzrz40b8KQuaAMlvEgnIUYqZ26ir4PuQ4n6XsbxtdyCLIHhKPU0Dr4u9Zr0cuUz0yTiYvFF8qwYzZ3L7cM65dNg4QSzFSJQ' alt='Jared Kushner during a &#x27;Board of Peace&#x27; meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Blueprint basics: Slide decks described tourist-oriented coastal high-rises, industrial or tech zones such as data centers, and upgraded transport links meant to reposition Gaza as a regional hub.</li><li>Governance question: One strand of the blueprint envisions a unified Gaza run by Palestinians, a point described as clashing with the goals of some Israeli far-right figures who have advocated depopulation and resettlement.</li><li>Ceasefire strain: Reports tied the announcement to an Israel-Hamas ceasefire that has faced repeated violations, with Gaza health officials cited saying Israeli strikes killed five Palestinians on Thursday.</li><li>Local backlash: Palestinians interviewed said the futuristic renderings risk erasing what remains of their homes and community, underscoring fears that reconstruction could mean displacement or loss of claims.</li><li>Feasibility hurdles: Coverage flagged obstacles including security, rubble clearance, financing, political legitimacy, and the challenge of turning glossy renderings into a workable plan amid unresolved war issues.</li></ul><blockquote>We&#x27;re going to be very successful in Gaza - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: Officials framed the “New Gaza” concept as a market-led reconstruction pathway overseen by President Trump’s “Board of Peace,” emphasizing ambitious redevelopment and economic growth.
