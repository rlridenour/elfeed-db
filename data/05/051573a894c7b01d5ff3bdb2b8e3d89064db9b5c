Boyle said that using iPhones provided "the ability to work in remote places, very quickly, and very lightly, leaving a light footprint."<br/>
<br/>
"We wanted our landscape to look like it hadn't been touched for 28 years by any human, so it was very advantageous for that," he added.<br/>
<br/>
"Director Danny Boyle pushed the power of iPhone to new cinematic heights in select scenes of 28 Years Later," says Apple. "In fact, the portable and powerful form factor of iPhone enabled the production team to build a custom rig using a unique 20 camera setup. Discover how his crew's camerawork innovations immerse audiences into shocking scenes."<br/>
