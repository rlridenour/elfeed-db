<p>It’s easy to imagine the myriad difficulties with which you’d be faced if you were suddenly transported a millennium back in time. But if you’re a native (or even proficient) English speaker in an English-speaking part of the world, the language, at least, surely wouldn’t be a problem. Or so you’d think, until your first encounter with utterances like “<em>þat troe is daed on gaerde</em>” or&nbsp;<em>“þa rokes forleten urne tun</em>.” Both of those sentences appear in <a href="https://youtu.be/842OX2_vCic?si=9wvMmpn2jBch8cSc">the new video above from Simon Roper</a>, in which he delivers a monologue beginning in the English of the fifth century and ending in the English of the end of the last millennium.</p>
<p>An Englishman specializing in videos about linguistics and anthropology, Roper has pulled off this sort of feat before: we previously featured him here on Open Culture for <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2024/08/hear-the-evolution-of-the-london-accent-over-660-years.html">his performance of a London accent as it evolved through 660 years</a>.</p>

<p>But writing and delivering a monologue that works its way through a millennium and a half of change in the English language is obviously a thornier endeavor, not least because it involves literal thorns — the <em>þ&nbsp;</em>characters, that is, used in the Old English Latin alphabet. They’re pronounced like <em>th</em>, which you can hear when Roper speaks the sentences quoted earlier, which translate to “The tree is dead in the yard” and “The rooks abandoned our town.”</p>
<p>The word&nbsp;<em>translate</em> should give us pause, since we’re only talking about English. But then, English has undergone such a dramatic evolution that, at far enough of a remove, we might as well be talking about different languages. What Roper emphasizes is that the changes didn’t happen suddenly. Non-Scandinavian listeners may lack even an inkling that his farmer of the year 450 is talking about sheep and pigs with the words <em>skēpu&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>swīnu</em>, but his final lines, in which he speaks of possessing&nbsp;“all the hot coffee I need” and “friends I didn’t have in New York” in the year 2000, will pose no difficulty to Anglophones anywhere in the world.&nbsp;Even his list of agricultural wealth around the early thirteenth century — “<em>We habben an god hus, we habben mani felds</em>” — could make you believe that a trip 600 years in the past would be, as they said in Middle English, <em>no trouble.</em></p>
