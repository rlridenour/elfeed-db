<p>Ugandans voted on Thursday, Jan. 15, in a tense presidential election with President Yoweri Museveni seeking to extend his decades-long rule and facing a rematch against opposition figure Bobi Wine. Authorities shut down internet access and limited some mobile phone services as voting began, a move that news outlets and rights groups described as constraining communication and observation around the polls. Multiple reports said the campaign period featured security crackdowns and arrests of opposition supporters, adding to concerns about the political environment in which the vote took place. Despite the disruptions, many voters still lined up at polling stations, underscoring strong public engagement in deciding Uganda’s future direction.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gw8iTQpwGOQMUcSSjEuOd62yllyO5K0lWALTFgybpXlLXkThMLNEdN46HlbbhRv5EgMDmb3cTOI_419laNQNfgYTn_TMJnL2qLUaHhD_5pOmYVOVftOUBzAGQWv_CbK_Y1jkkwVzpNWKIQKBvSQMClN7VCYfp7gRGXn6E8NNh9ZrUOfv7rmOABUXAwGIdEvO8D49n-W_gql4sfJI9Ca5-H90bnccAWwm2vtcJSReux82PSoiOaAoqXjqJU9-jqG4MnBfn7EeBbCfnd3EQA' alt='Uganda police patrol the streets ahead of the general elections in Kampala, Jan. 14, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Delays reported: Media reports described widespread delays at some polling stations as voting got underway during the shutdown, complicating logistics for voters trying to cast ballots early in the day.</li><li>Security presence: Some reports described a heavy security posture in the capital, including soldiers and police on streets ahead of the vote, reflecting heightened tensions around election day.</li><li>Rights groups targeted: Authorities suspended some rights organizations and arrested civil-society members during the campaign period, according to reporting that framed the election environment as restrictive for monitors and activists.</li><li>Candidates contrast: The race again paired Museveni, in power since 1986, against Wine, a 43-year-old musician-turned-politician whose support is often linked to younger voters seeking political change.</li><li>System debate: One analysis argued that calls for youth-led mobilizations risk getting channeled into established political programs without addressing deeper economic and governance grievances, highlighting a broader debate over what meaningful change would look like.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ugandan authorities: The government implemented an internet shutdown and limited some mobile services as voting began, a step presented in reporting as a security-related measure around election day.
