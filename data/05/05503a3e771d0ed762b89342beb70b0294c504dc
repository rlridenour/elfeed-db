In iOS 26, you can use AirPods 4, AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3 as a wireless microphone with supported camera apps. Think of it as turning your AirPods into a lapel mic – you get professional-quality audio capture as well as the freedom to move around during recording. Here's how it works.<br/>

<h2>Setting Up AirPods as Your Camera Microphone</h2><br/>
Using AirPods as a microphone in iOS 26 requires just a few quick steps through Control Center. Make sure your AirPods are connected to your iPhone or iPad before you begin. Note that using AirPods as a camera microphone isn't available in all countries or regions.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>With your AirPods in your ears, open the Camera app.</li><br/>
  <li>Switch to <strong>Video</strong> mode in the Camera app.</li><br/>
  <li>Open Control Center by swiping down from the upper-right corner of the screen.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Camera Controls</strong> at the top.</li><br/>
  <li>Under "Audio & Video," tap <strong>Input</strong>, then select your AirPods from the pop-up menu. (Note: You might also see <strong>Same as System</strong> as an option.)</li><br/>

<br/>
<h3>Mic Mode Options</h3><br/>
From the same Camera Controls screen, you can also choose from four different microphone modes to suit your recording environment:<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li><strong>Automatic</strong>: Lets your device choose the optimal setting.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Standard</strong>: Default audio processing.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Voice Isolation</strong>: Reduces background noise and emphasizes speech.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Wide Spectrum</strong>: Captures a fuller range of ambient sounds.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Start Your Recording</h2><br/>
When you're ready, press the stem on your AirPods to begin recording video. You now have hands-free control over your recording session while your AirPods capture the audio. When you're done, press your AirPods stem again to end the shoot.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-use-airpods-as-mic-shooting-video/">iOS 26: Use AirPods as Microphone When Shooting Video</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-use-airpods-as-microphone-when-shooting-video.2466418/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
