2027 will mark the 20th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and Apple is planning to celebrate with an all-new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; design. With the 10th anniversary of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Apple unveiled the all-display &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X with no bezels at the top or the bottom for the camera or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> home button. It marked the debut of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, and dictated the next decade of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; design.<br/>

For the "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XX," Apple needs to do even better, and rumors suggest that the company has some big ideas that it's aiming for.<br/>
<br/>
Apple wants to create an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-design/">all-glass iPhone</a> that doesn't have cutouts in the display, so there could be a high-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 19 Pro model that fulfills that requirement. Apple wants a true <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-report/">edge-to-edge display</a><br/>
<br/>

The 20th anniversary &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple is planning for 2027 could feature a radical design, offering a display that has no visible frame or bezels. An early rumor suggests that Apple is aiming for a display that curves around all four edges of the device, for a borderless visual experience.<br/>
<br/>

Apple wants a mostly glass &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a curved display and no cutouts, which would necessitate under-display &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; and an under-display camera.<br/>
<br/>
An all-glass &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a wraparound display that covers all four edges of the device would be less durable than current &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models that have titanium or aluminum frames, so Apple may need to come up with more durable glass before such a device is a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="battery">Battery</h2><br/>
Apple is developing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/2027-iphone-game-changing-silicon-battery/">new battery technology</a> that could make it into the 2027 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models. Apple is looking into using pure silicon anode batteries, which are able to store more lithium ions per gram than current batteries, resulting in significant increases in battery life without major increases in battery size.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ram">RAM</h2><br/>
Apple could use advanced AI memory technology for the 2027 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models. Apple is rumored to be considering Mobile High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), a type of DRAM that stacks memory chips vertically and connects them through tiny vertical interconnects to boost signal transmission speeds.<br/>
<br/>
In smartphones, the technology would provide high data throughput while minimizing power consumption and the physical footprint of RAM dies.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="name">Name</h2><br/>
Technically, the 20th anniversary &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup would be the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 19 lineup, but in 2017, Apple released a surprise "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X" alongside the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 models. This year, Apple could have similar plans for the high-end device, though what it might be called is unclear.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could decide to call it the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 20, like the decision it made for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X in 2017, or the company could stick with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 19 naming. Alternatively, the all-display device could have an entirely new name, like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-ultra/">iPhone Ultra</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple has planned could be a replacement for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pro models, or it could be sold alongside them. With plans for a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in 2026, though, it may not make sense to add yet another phone to the lineup.<br/>

The 20th anniversary &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; would presumably come out in the fall of 2027.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/20th-anniversary-iphone/">Apple&#039;s 20th Anniversary iPhone: What We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-20th-anniversary-iphone-what-we-know-so-far.2457232/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
