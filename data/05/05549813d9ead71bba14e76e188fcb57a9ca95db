I was several years into my Emacs usage before mis-types revealed the glory of the &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; and &ldquo;widen&rdquo; functions to me. Actually, it was one of those nightmares: &ldquo;Whoa! Where&rsquo;d my document go!? And why isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;undo&rdquo; bringing it back?&rdquo; When the tears subsided, I soon realized how useful these commands are. By selecting a region and narrowing it you focus your editing and attention on a portion of what might otherwise be massive files; by so doing, your search/replace commands and your commands to jump to buffer boundaries are contained in a useful area.
