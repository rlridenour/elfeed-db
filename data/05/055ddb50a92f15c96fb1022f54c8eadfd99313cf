<p>The BBC&#x27;s chair, Samir Shah, sent a personal letter apologising to President Trump for a misleading edit of his January 6, 2021, speech that aired in a Panorama documentary, and the corporation said it would not rebroadcast the programme. The broadcaster said it &quot;sincerely regrets&quot; the edit but rejected that the material amounted to defamation, and its lawyers have told Trump’s legal team there is no legal basis for his $1 billion claim. The episode&#x27;s splice prompted an internal review and concern about a possible second misleading edit, and the wider fallout has already seen senior BBC news executives step down.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/rHKNIupZFYbl4os639KkF6C026WG8aePMmSdsvCOeNAaxT1SwHg6F3OwfhZP7IzjtmBbfQDcW9roB0xkvtunePjKdbZmt8agDDUxn2lTN25BggTIUd1YKn5fEU7M1Q73x2cP8nqGFygWw7EwXmJALQRjlyxpauN6AR0DkTmgPMJnQ4SzN_mER6_59y-KJhvyAMPxAeHLG7JN2p7pum_ZOdRFdeL3Cx-K8ybymYE6Zzj6nXjBOE2z0IzkiSQ4IDsPElamizC9mVks0hWoKQ' alt='Security outside BBC Broadcasting House after senior executives resigned following accusations over edited footage.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Executive fallout: Two senior BBC news leaders resigned amid the controversy, a development linked to questions about editorial oversight of the Panorama episode.</li><li>Legal posture: The BBC said it will not pay compensation and told Trump&#x27;s lawyers it &#x27;strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,&#x27; signalling it expects to defend itself in any legal action.</li><li>Additional probe: The corporation said it is investigating a separate instance in which footage of the same speech may have been edited misleadingly for a 2022 Newsnight report.</li><li>White House reaction: The White House pushed back, with aides saying Mr. Trump demanded apology, retraction and compensation and a spokeswoman calling the BBC a &#x27;leftist propaganda machine&#x27; in public comments reported by US outlets.</li><li>Suit not filed: Trump’s legal team told media the president had threatened a $1 billion suit but had not yet filed litigation as of the latest reports.</li></ul><blockquote>We strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim. - BBC spokesperson</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>BBC (chair Samir Shah / corporation): Samir Shah wrote a personal letter to the White House saying he and the corporation are sorry for the edit, and the BBC said it will not rebroadcast the Panorama episode while it investigates.
