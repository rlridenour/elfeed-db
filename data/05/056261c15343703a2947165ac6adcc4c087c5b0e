<p>South Africa’s foreign ministry declared Israel’s top diplomat in Pretoria, chargé d’affaires Ariel Seidman, persona non grata and gave him 72 hours to leave the country, escalating already strained relations between the two governments. Israel responded by ordering out South Africa’s diplomatic representative, in a reciprocal move described across reports as a tit-for-tat expulsion. South Africa said the decision followed what it described as repeated breaches of diplomatic norms and protocol, including what some reports said were insulting attacks on President Cyril Ramaphosa, with references to remarks made on social media. Israel rejected the move as unfounded, as the dispute adds to a wider political rift that has included South Africa’s 2023 case at the UN’s top court arguing Israel’s war in Gaza amounts to genocide. While expulsions are a sharp diplomatic signal, they can also create a clearer moment for formal channels to reset; the immediate next steps will likely revolve around how both countries manage consular links and any remaining diplomatic engagement under lowered representation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/34MYhUw_j36ZMH4mzt_xiuntoykLUnM5iJ7tGcsnB5D8Y6vx_j2q8xtPGMaaqbmGSVkX-k0z-8bVxnSZJOPotyf24RfVXGxKuENNtAFWXKs4JvR_rN3kul01iKwzxSLZJYfNFOdDYi_DnRRqyzsOODh6LGuMUKpNHZwp8kFUEuMSvYTaDXtBeD1TYLKbH6nW4Xt57ydXkHIC6Oa2Kx6POBmF4hu_9eBowTJsZ1zGFJ4wXsISS8eBXOg_QF4lQVXbWZbKSasOmy8Nr21SEnzUYtdctA' alt='Photo used in coverage of South Africa’s decision to expel Israel’s top diplomat.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Persona non grata: South Africa said it formally notified Israel that Seidman was persona non grata and must depart within 72 hours, a step that typically ends an envoy’s ability to operate in the host country.</li><li>Protocol allegations: Pretoria framed the expulsion around alleged “violations” and “gross abuse of diplomatic privilege,” presenting the dispute as one about diplomatic conduct as well as politics.</li><li>US angle: One report noted the move could further complicate South Africa’s ties with the United States, highlighting the broader geopolitical ripple effects of the spat.</li><li>Wider pattern: The envoy expulsions follow a series of clashes between Israel and South Africa since the Gaza war began, reflecting a longer-running deterioration rather than a one-off incident.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>South Africa’s foreign ministry (DIRCO): Pretoria said it expelled Israel’s top diplomat over repeated violations of diplomatic protocol and what it described as insulting attacks on President Cyril Ramaphosa, giving him 72 hours to leave.
