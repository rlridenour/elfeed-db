<p>Henry Blodget, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/29/henry-blodget-comeback-business-insider">who sold Business Insider to German publishing giant Axel Springer</a> for $340 million a decade ago, has supposedly launched a new site, Regenerator, built  on Substack. I was going to tack on an “alas” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack">re: building on Substack</a>, but maybe this is the sort of thing Substack deserves.</p>

<p>The gist of his debut post is that he used ChatGPT to create a small “staff” of teammates to work with, along with photos of these personalities, and he developed a crush on his new CEO. Really.</p>

<p>Do I think he’s serious? No, not at all. Do I think he wrote this to generate attention just like I’m giving him now? Yes, obviously. But I really do have to salute the absolute shamelessness of him playing this straight, painting himself as an utter buffoon, a tone deaf jackass, and downright weirdo, just for the attention. (Blodget has <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/24/blodget">never been</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/04/26/blodget">very smart</a> even when he isn’t <em>trying</em> to make a fool of himself.)</p>
