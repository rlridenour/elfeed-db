<blockquote><p>
A gentleman walked up to another gentleman, who was standing before the fire in a Coffee Room, and immediately said, &#8216;I beg your pardon, Sir, but may I ask your name?&#8217; &#8216;I am not in the habit, Sir,&#8217; said the other man, &#8216;of giving my name to strangers, but, as you are so pertinacious, Sir, my name is Thompson, Sir.&#8217; &#8216;Then, Mr. Thompson, Sir,&#8217; said the first speaker, &#8216;now I know your name, I beg, Sir, to inform you that your coat tails are on fire.&#8217;
