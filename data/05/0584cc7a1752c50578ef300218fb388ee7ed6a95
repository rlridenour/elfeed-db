<p>Last week Apple released 26.2 updates to its operating systems, and if you’re on the 26 train, you should install .2 because it includes <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125884">a bunch of security updates</a> including some zero-days.</p>
<p>In its list of security update details, Apple credits a bunch of security researchers for discovering the issues. Among them is Rosyna Keller of Totally Not Malicious software—fantastic name—who found bugs in MediaExperience, Messages, and Telephony. Keller says that <a href="https://x.com/rosyna/status/1999651923277090923">the Messages fix alone</a> is worth updating to iOS 26.2, or if you’re still on iOS 18, updating to iOS 18.7.3. (Though I’m hearing reports that phones that can run iOS 26 aren’t being offered iOS 18.7.3, only iOS 26.2—which is not great, since this is a security update and shouldn’t force migration to iOS 26.)</p>
<p>Related: Due to health and other reasons, Keller has fallen on hard times and <a href="https://x.com/rosyna/status/1997486877323247635">apparently hasn’t been compensated by Apple</a> for the security reports. There’s <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-needed-to-prevent-eviction-and-maintain-health">a GoFundMe campaign</a> to help the long-time Mac developer.</p>
