<li>Can they make a margarita: a more important question would be, if you mix some into a margarita, does that make it a healthy meal?</li>
</ul><h1>Plant-Based</h1><p>The timing for this sale is interesting because, just earlier this week, I listened to a particularly excellent episode of one of my favorite podcasts, Slate’s <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decoder-ring/id1376577202">Decoder Ring</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-protein-muscled-its-way-to-the-top/id1376577202?i=1000737306308">This one</a> traced the history of protein supplements, from their origin in the 19th century with Liebig’s Extract of Meat (which sounds vile and also, hilariously, contained too little protein to measure) all the way to the present, when you can find everything from protein popcorn to protein ice cream at your local supermarket.</p>
<p>The two most interesting takeaways were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Throughout their history, many protein supplements have been born out of waste. And we don’t wastefulness, but literal waste. Like, garbage. For example, US dairy farmers upped milk production during the world wars. Afterwards, the market for milk dipped, but the farmers were already making a ton of milk. So they put it towards cheese, which incidentally created a ton of whey. After letting this just drain into rivers and water supplies for a while, absolutely devastating marine life and the environment, they found a way to turn this vile run-off into cash with whey protein powder. (Which, to be entirely clear, today’s product <strong>does not</strong> contain.)</li>
</ol>
<p>And…</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Despite what health and wellness influencers would have you believe, if you are eating even a relatively balanced diet, you are almost definitely getting enough protein without the need for supplements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, full disclosure, I am writing from memory here, and what’s more, I listened to this podcast on a run. If I have misrepresented anything, blame the endorphin high. Still, interesting stuff, right?</p>
<p>And yet, despite all this… I still do enjoy consuming the occasional protein product. A nice protein smoothie or a protein bar can be a tasty, low-calorie breakfast that leaves me satisfied without feeling uncomfortably full.</p>
<p>These powders could be great for something like that. They provide a good, heaping helping of plant-based (aka non-whey) protein that you can mix into some almond milk or oatmeal or yogurt and granola or what have you.</p>
<p>So, if you want protein powder, here’s some protein powder. Also, we have it for way cheaper than you’ll find elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want more podcasts about food, Decoder Ring’s episode on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-the-jalape%C3%B1o-lost-its-heat/id1376577202?i=1000744906228">why jalapeños aren’t as spicy as they used to be</a> is also great.</p>
