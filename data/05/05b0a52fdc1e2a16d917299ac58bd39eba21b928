</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A confounding dream of childhood friend administering a quirky chemistry test.
</p>
        <p><time datetime="2025-08-03" title="2025-08-03">A few nights ago</time> I had a dream in which a childhood friend had created a chemistry
course and was administering a test.  The first 10 questions were food related.
There were pictures of a main dish and possible side dishes; none of the
pictures were of good quality, making it hard to discern what we were comparing.
And we had to pick the best side-dish and show our work.  I was confused and
somewhat paralyzed at how I could know the right answer as well as show my work
supporting that.  And from what I could make out of the pictures, the choices
were of things I’ve had with those dishes before.</p>
<p>I’m accustomed to picking something based on a qualitative evaluation; one in
which I write up why I’m deciding something.  Yet this dream left me perplexed.
What goes with a dish?  I could write up my thoughts on why this, but relative
to the others?  Would I need to refute those other options?</p>
<p>I’ve known this person since I was 9.  And he often thinks of things in
different ways.  He’s an entrepreneurial hippy stoner, who in high school would
walk the halls playing guitar and singing aloud.  So the test felt like
something he might administer.</p>
<p>What can I tease from that dream?</p>
<p>Are there decisions that I’m facing in which the right choice is so close to
other choices that any would do?  Am I recognizing that I’m facing something in
which it’s comical to spend time on a decision?  Do I feel as though the “show
your work” is a press towards busyness without much utility?</p>
<p>Or is there something related to my friend?  I don’t talk with him much, only
when I bump into him in Goshen; he’s always walking with a cup of coffee in
hand.  I did see him and his family at Goshen Brewing Company; his parents both
older than mine, looking a bit more hunched and wrinkled.</p>
<p>Maybe a bit less cheese before bed?</p>
