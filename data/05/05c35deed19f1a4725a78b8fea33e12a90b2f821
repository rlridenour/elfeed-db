<p>This is currently a work in progress, but I have a 0.1.0 release of a
&ldquo;One Ring To Rule Them All&rdquo; Markdown processor published.</p>

<p>The goal of Apex is to make it possible to write in any Markdown
processor&rsquo;s syntax, be it Kramdown (with IALs), MultiMarkdown (with v6
extensions), CommonMark (with GFM extensions), or any syntax that uses
parts of those processors. Apex defaults to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unified</code> mode that
combines the features of all of these, automatically adjusting to the
syntax it finds.</p>

<p>Where CommonMark is strict, Apex aims to be <em>very</em> permissive. While I
advocate for clean, clear Markdown, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry whether
the Markdown you wrote for GitHub is going to work on your blog, or
whether syntax you used in Marked is going to work when you export from
the command line.</p>

<p>Speaking of <a href="https://markedapp.com">Marked</a>, yes, the ultimate goal of
Apex is to have a Markdown processor option in Marked that&rsquo;s essentially
universal. It will default to Apex and the user won&rsquo;t have to question
why their Markdown from Obsidian isn&rsquo;t working in Marked, and I won&rsquo;t
have to explain the differences between the processors anymore. Apex has
a ways to go before it&rsquo;s stable enough for production integration like
that, but it&rsquo;s already not far off. But I&rsquo;m also open sourcing it, so
please feel free to contribute (any code contributors will be named in
Marked&rsquo;s credits when it&rsquo;s integrated). Even if that just means filing
Issues, any help making this bulletproof is appreciated.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve set up a <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/apex">GitHub repo</a>, and a pretty complete <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/apex/wiki">wiki</a> for the
project. It details installation, usage, syntax, and more.</p>

<p>Some of the special features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^</code> to break consecutive lists</li>
  <li>Use Marked, MultiMarkdown, or iA Writer syntax to include external files
    <ul>
      <li>automatically detects images, source code, and Markdown files and inserts the correct formatting</li>
      <li>if a CSV file is included, it&rsquo;s converted to a table</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Marked and Leanpub pagebreak syntax, which can be styled to create page breaks in print and PDF</li>
  <li>Advanced table syntax, allowing for rowspans and footers!</li>
  <li>Relaxed table mode allowing any consecutive lines with an even number of piped cells to create a headless table, no alignment row required</li>
  <li>Callout syntax from Bear/Obsidian and Xcode playgrounds works and generates basic markup you can style as needed (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--standalone</code> mode can automatically include a basic stylesheet for these)</li>
  <li>Table of Contents with min/max depth, using MMD or Marked syntax</li>
  <li>configurable header id generation
    <ul>
      <li>No IDs</li>
      <li>GFM style with dashes</li>
      <li>MMD style with spaces compressed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GitHub style link anchors instead of header IDs</li>
  <li>350+ GitHub emojis recognized and rendered</li>
  <li>Wiki linking</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus: the IALs from Kramdown, which is a feature I use all the time. It
allows you to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{: .callout}</code> after an element to add a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class="callout"</code> to the block or span. It can add an id, multiple
classes, and random attributes.</p>

<p>More to come, but I think it&rsquo;s ready to put out there for testing and
feedback. I haven&rsquo;t fully tested every possible syntax yet, and there
will definitely be bugs, so please report via <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/apex/issues">GitHub issues</a>
and help me get it to 1.0.</p>

<p>You can install with <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> if you don&rsquo;t want to build it yourself:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>brew tap ttscoff/thelab
brew <span class="nb">install </span>ttscoff/thelab/apex</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/apex/wiki">Check out the wiki</a> for more details. I&rsquo;ll be adding a project
page for this soon, but it will mirror what&rsquo;s in the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/apex">GitHub
README</a> and link to the wiki for details anyway.</p>
