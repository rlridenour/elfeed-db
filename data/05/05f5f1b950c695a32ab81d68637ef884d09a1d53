<p>Just a very quick one today.</p>
<p>I recently needed to find the number of days between two dates. I thought this would be easy in Emacs, and indeed it was, but as with most things in Emacs, you need to know exactly what you&rsquo;re doing. Here is the method I used:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">  M-x =calendar=

  Navigate to the start date

  Set mark

  Navigate to the end date

  M-x =calendar-count-days-region=

  OR

  M-=
</code></pre><p>Note that the count is inclusive of the mark, the documentation says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is bound to M-=.</p>
<p>Count the number of days (inclusive) between point and the mark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is all. 🙂</p>
