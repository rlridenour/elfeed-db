<p>I am currently keeping all my textual notes in a separate org file called appropriately, <strong>notes.org</strong>.  This is pretty much just a random rambling set of text containing bits and bobs that I don&rsquo;t want to forget.</p>

<p>If I am mobile and want to jot something down I use an android app called <strong>Markor</strong>, just open up the notes.org as a text file and add something in. <strong>Syncthing</strong> means that this file is present on my laptop when I open it up in emacs.</p>
<p>In emacs, I can open the file, edit it and save it, but it all seems a little too clunky to me. If I want to just register a thought or idea isn&rsquo;t there a better way to accomplish this in emacs?, the answer of course as we all know is&hellip; YES!</p>
<p>I will add a note right now that am vaguely aware of org-capture but I get a sense that this might be too much in terms of functionality.  I really just want a quick method to record some keystrokes in whatever form I see fit.</p>
<p>I will again double down on my main requirement for introducing a new workflow in emacs and that is to use vanilla emacs where I can and that would involve either built-in functionality or maybe a little elisp.</p>
<p>Lets list some packages and search through the <strong>built-in</strong> emacs packages&hellip; The following seems to present itself! :</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">remember 2.0 built-in a mode for quickly jotting down things to remember
</code></pre><p>This seems to be nice and simple and the Help file is quite informative. It is based around the concept of quickly recording something to remember and then organise at a later date. As it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the initial &ldquo;just remember this&rdquo; impulse should be as close to simply throwing the data at Emacs as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and as we know, emacs is very good at handling data.</p>
<p>Out of the box, running <code>M-x remember</code> brings up a blank <strong>Remember</strong> window buffer encouraging you to <code>C-c C-c to remember the data</code>, You can enter anything you want and with <code>C-c C-c</code> the window disappears with your input appended to a text file. Perfect!</p>
<p>By default a <strong>notes</strong> file is stored in .emacs.d/ and I think I might just want to change this to point to my own <strong>notes.org</strong>.  By default the following is a typical entry appended to the bottom of a notes file:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">**Mon Oct 10 15:25:29 2022 (test)

test
</code></pre><p>This initial form can be tweaked to conform to whatever notes format text file you have, in my case I added the following to my .emacs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">&#39;</span>(remember-annotation-functions <span style="color:#66d9ef">nil</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">&#39;</span>(remember-data-file <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/home/usr/content/notes.org&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">&#39;</span>(remember-leader-text <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;**&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">&#39;</span>(remember-notes-initial-major-mode <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;org-mode</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">&#39;</span>(remember-time-format <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(global-set-key (kbd <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;C-c n&#34;</span>) <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;remember</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now if a thought occurs and I don&rsquo;t trust my aging brain to remember, a quick <code>C-c n, text input, C-c C-c</code> flick of the fingers will record that information. The window is transitory and doesn&rsquo;t disrupt my emacs session and the text org file will be updated and then synced to my phone for a later potential recall.</p>
<p>There are other aspects of remember that I could explore, like what is a diary file?, but I don&rsquo;t care too much about that, this works perfectly and is another example of the simple out-of-the-box amazingness of emacs!</p>
