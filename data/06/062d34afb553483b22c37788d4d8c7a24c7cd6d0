<p>George Orwell&#8217;s six rules of writing, from <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/">&#8220;Politics and the English Language,&#8221;</a> 1946:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.</li>
<li>Never use a long word where a short one will do.</li>
<li>If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</li>
<li>Never use the passive where you can use the active.</li>
<li>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.</li>
<li>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</li>
</ol>
<p>But &#8220;one could keep all of them and still write bad English.&#8221;</p>
