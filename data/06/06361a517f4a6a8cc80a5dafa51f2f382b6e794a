<p>&#8220;The PSA Office Hour aims to facilitate interactions between our graduate student membership and prominent philosophers of science, and in a more controlled, accessible, and carbon-conscious setting than is provided by our biennial conference,&#8221; says the association.</p>
<p>It does this by setting up online office hours featuring philosophers of science, with a different topic for each session. Graduate students sign-up in advance, indicating why they want to meet (e.g., input on dissertation topic choice, help with a problem with one&#8217;s research, clarification on the professor&#8217;s research, etc.). &#8220;Students from any institution, region, or at any stage of their graduate studies are welcome to attend&#8230; Office hours will last up to 90 minutes and participants must be current members of the PSA. This opportunity is primarily for graduate students, but postdocs are free to apply as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>The topics and experts this term are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Political Philosophy of Science with S. Andrew Schroeder (Claremont McKenna)</li>
<li>Philosophy of Physics with David Wallace (Pittsburgh)</li>
<li>New Approaches to Realism with Michela Massimi (Edinburgh) and Mazviita Chirimuuta (Pittsburgh/Edinburgh)</li>
<li>Philosophy of AI with Atoosa Kasirzadeh (Carnegie Mellon) and William D&#8217;Alessandro (William &amp; Mary)</li>
</ul>
