Along with the iPhone 18 Fold expected to launch in late 2026, Apple is working on a larger-screened foldable device that could be a MacBook-iPad hybrid of some sort. According to one analyst, both devices were set to enter mass production towards the end of next year, but a new report now suggests the larger model is further away than originally thought.<br/>

In a research note reflecting on Apple's recent third-quarter earnings, investment firm GF Securities' lead analyst Jeff Pu said he expects "limited innovation" from Apple in its upcoming iPhone 17 lineup. Instead, Pu reserves his excitement for the iPhone 18 Fold, for which he has seen "intact progress" in the supply chain pointing to a release in the second half of 2026. <br/>
<br/>
"On the other hand," writes Pu, "the 18.8-inch foldable device is likely to be postponed." The analyst offered no reason for the expected delay, but the report suggests the device will no longer enter mass production in the fourth quarter of 2026 for a likely 2027 release, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/">previously indicated</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman believes that Apple is working on a foldable ‌iPad‌ with a 20-inch display that will come out in 2028, while analyst Ross Young has said that he expects a foldable tablet-like device in 2026 or 2027, so it's safe to say there's uncertainty about a launch date. There also appear to be conflicting reports about what kind of device the larger foldable will be.<br/>
<br/>
Pu believes the foldable device that Apple is working on will be a MacBook-iPad hybrid with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-foldable-macos-prediction/">touch-based screen and support for macOS</a>. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also referred to Apple's larger foldable device as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/20-inch-foldable-macbook-crease-free-rumor/">MacBook</a>, while Ross Young has also written about Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/18-8-inch-foldable-macbook-rumor/">work on a notebook</a> with an 18.8-inch display. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> said in December that Apple is working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/iphone-17-air-19-inch-macbook-report/">19-inch MacBook with a foldable screen</a>.<br/>
<br/>
However, Gurman has referred to Apple's large-screened foldable device as an ‌iPad‌, as has research firm Omdia. Whether the large-screened foldable is ultimately an ‌iPad‌ or a Mac will come down to the operating system that Apple is planning to use. If the device runs macOS, it'll be in the Mac family, and if it runs iPadOS, it'll be in the ‌iPad‌ family. Gurman has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/ios-19-big-design-changes/">claimed</a> that some of the design updates that Apple has made in iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe to unify the operating systems will pave the way for foldable devices and touchscreen Macs, so a hybrid is also a possibility.<br/>

All in all, the details of Apple's larger foldable device remain murky. That's in contrast to rumors about Apple's smaller book-style foldable iPhone, which have recently been converging on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/foldable-iphone-expected-2026-rumored-features/">2026 release</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/">Foldable MacBook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/apple-larger-foldable-miss-2026-production/">Apple&#039;s 18.8-Inch Foldable Device Could Miss 2026 Production Target</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-18-8-inch-foldable-device-could-miss-2026-production-target.2462723/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
