<p>starting to get annoyed with Zen on the Mac.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t play Netflix and the like because DRM issues. Can&rsquo;t view embedded MP4s on my own blog because of a decoder issue. With the fact that Zen never synced fully using my Firefox account, I am considering returning to Orion, or just using Safari again.</p>
