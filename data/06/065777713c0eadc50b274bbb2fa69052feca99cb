After my <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12837">latest annual happy birthday wishes</a> to Pink Floyd&rsquo;s iconic <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12837#comment-6667752952">MarkB</a> sent along a link to David Gilmour and his daughter Romany singing <i>Wish You Were Here</i> at an impromptu appearance at an open mic night in a local pub. That was in September 2024. Shortly after MarkB sent the video, I was telling some friends about it and one asked me how old Romany was. I didn&rsquo;t know but said I thought she was in her early twenties.

The next day, I decided to look it up and discovered to my horror that <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12837">Romany had passed away in February 2025</a>. She was only 22. My heart goes out to Gilmour and his wife Polly Samson. I can&rsquo;t imagine the pain of losing a child like that.</p>
