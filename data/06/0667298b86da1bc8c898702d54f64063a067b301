Speaking to <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/apple-aapl-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">CNBC</a></em>, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> said that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue was up because the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> turned out to be more popular with consumers than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> was during the same time period last year.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; sales increased "strong double digits" compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, and Cook said the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models were particularly popular with current &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users upgrading to a new model. Cook's statement covers the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max, though he did not provide specific insight into which devices were the best sellers. <br/>

Apple also saw growth in Mac sales thanks to the M4 Mac lineup, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sales and sales in the Wearables, Home and Accessories category were down.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/iphone-16-more-popular-than-iphone-15/">Apple CEO Tim Cook: iPhone 16 More Popular Than iPhone 15</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-iphone-16-more-popular-than-iphone-15.2462562/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
