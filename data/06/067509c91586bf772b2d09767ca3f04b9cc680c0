<p>When some of my Opensource projects became a little popular, I experienced the same situation. I received a lot of feedback and issues through many channels: email, Mastodon, IRC, Hacker News comments, etc, but rarely as issue on GitHub (or similar system).</p>
<p>For any developer it is very important to follow up on problems. We need to work with the affected user to understand the problem and reproduce the bug. In this situation, we prefer a place where we can show code or logs, keep a history and talk privately. For me this is basic and natural. I use a ticket system. In my case I ask two things: GitHub account (or a Gmail account) and a good description. That is all I ask!</p>
<p>However, I often hear these arguments for continuing the conversation in the same space:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I don't like GitHub because of Microsoft."</li>
<li>"I prefer to talk with Email."</li>
<li>"Mastodon is free, what is the problem?"</li>
<li>"I don't want to create an account."</li>
</ul>
<p>It isn't appropriate to paste code in a commentary box or Mastodon thread. I am sorry if that feels inconvenient but please try to think about the maintainer's needs. My software is Opensource, a sign of affection for the community, and if you want help, make it easy for me to help you.</p>
<p>Thank you 🙂</p>
