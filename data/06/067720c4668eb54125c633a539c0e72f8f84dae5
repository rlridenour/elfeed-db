<p>In the 1980s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parents_Music_Resource_Center">The Parents Music Resource Center</a> (PMRC), an organization co-founded by Tipper Gore and the wives of several other Washington power brokers, launched a political campaign against pop music, hoping&nbsp;to put warning labels on records that promoted&nbsp;Sex, Violence, Drug and Alcohol Use. Along the way, the PMRC issued&nbsp;“<a href="http://www.nndb.com/lists/405/000093126/">the Filthy Fifteen</a>,” a list of 15 particularly objectionable songs. Hits by Madonna, Prince and Cyndi Lauper made the list. But the list really took aim at heavy metal bands from the 80s&nbsp;— namely, Judas Priest, Mötley Crüe, Twisted Sister, W.A.S.P., Def Leppard, Black Sabbath, and Venom. (Interesting footnote: the Soviets separately <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2015/06/soviets-create-a-list-charging-38-rock-bands-with-crimes.html">created a list of blackballed rock bands</a>, and it looked pretty much the same.)</p>
<p>Above, you can watch Twisted Sister’s Dee Snider appear before Congress in 1985 and accuse the PMRC of misinterpreting his band’s lyrics and waging a false war against metal music. The evidence 40 years later suggests that Snider perhaps had a point.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15298868.2015.1036918">study</a> by psychology researchers at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/">Humboldt State</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osu.edu/">Ohio State</a>, <a href="http://www.ucr.edu/">UC Riverside</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>&nbsp;“examined 1980s heavy metal groupies, musicians, and fans at middle age” — 377 participants in total — and found that, although metal enthusiasts certainly lived riskier lives as kids, they&nbsp;were nonetheless “significantly happier in their youth and better adjusted currently than either middle-aged or current college-age youth comparison groups.” This left the researchers to contemplate one possible conclusion: “participation in fringe style cultures may enhance identity development in troubled youth.” Not to mention that heavy metal lyrics don’t easily turn kids into&nbsp;damaged goods.</p>
