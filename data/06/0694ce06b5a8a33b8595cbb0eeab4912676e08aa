<p>Back in the 90’s, I did not hold in high regard the <strong>Make</strong> command with its cryptic syntax, insistence on making a tab space semantically significant, and platform/vendor-specific idiosyncrasies. Surely, I thought then, <strong>Make</strong> will get replaced by a better tool any day now.</p>
<p>Today it is March 13, 2025. <strong>Make</strong> is still here and isn't going anywhere. With every fiber of my being I <em>know</em> that <strong>Make</strong> will outlive all of us. It is now too deeply rooted in our computing infrastructure to go away.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the 2010’s I accepted the above observation and to paraphrase Kubrick, just stopped worrying and learned to love <strong>Make</strong>.</p>
<p>That said, for all of <strong>Make</strong>’s ubiquity, there aren't that many tools around to help you edit makefiles.</p>
<p>Emacs supports makefile editing with <code>make-mode</code> which has a mix of useful and half-baked (though thankfully obsoleted in 30.1) commands. It is from this substrate that I'm happy to announce the next Casual user interface: <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/docs/make-mode.org">Casual Make</a>.</p>
<p>Of particular note to Casual Make is its attention to authoring and identifying automatic variables whose arcane syntax is un-memorizable. Want to know what <code>$&lt;</code>  means? Just select it in the makefile and use the <code>.</code> binding in the Casual Make menu to identify what it does in the mini-buffer.</p>
<p>Casual Make is now available with the latest update of <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/releases/tag/2.4.0">Casual v2.4.0</a> on <a href="https://melpa.org/#/casual">MELPA</a>. This is a big update that also includes Info documentation for Casual for the first time.</p>
<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
<p>If your vocation involves programming computers, learn <strong>Make</strong>. The rewards will pay off handsomely as you will find utility in using <strong>Make</strong> for tasks both big and small. This is especially so for Emacs users who can take advantage of the <code>compile</code> command which by default invokes <strong>Make</strong>. The combination of Emacs compilation mode, make mode, command completion &amp; history makes for a compelling IDE for task running.</p>
