</ul><h1>Look Better</h1><p>Hear us out: we’re not selling a webcam today. We’re selling a better job.</p>
<p>Or, okay, that’s an overstatement. Let’s try: a better experience at your same job.</p>
<p>You know the phrase ‘dress for success’? Basically, the implication is that, if you clean yourself up and put on a nice suit, you’ll <em>look</em> serious. And if you <em>look</em> serious, people will <em>treat</em> you seriously. And if you look serious, and people think you’re serious, you are, essentially, serious.</p>
<p>Well, things have changed.</p>
<p>At least, they have for those who work from home.</p>
<p>No longer is a crisp suit necessary to convey you’re a professional. A clean shirt and a shower is all you need. And a nice room with a clean wall, or maybe a nice bookshelf, or some tasteful art. Also, some good lighting, so everyone can see that nice shirt, that clean hair, and that nice background.</p>
<p>Hence, you need a nice webcam, not just the one that’s built into your laptop.</p>
<p>Like this one! It’s adjustable for getting the perfect angle, it can do full HD 1080p video, and it has a ring light, so you can always have good light, regardless of where your desk is in relation to the windows, lamps, and overheads.</p>
<p>If you look like you’re hunched over in some sort of windowless dungeon every time there’s a meeting (or a huddle, or whatever the hell they’re calling the thing that could’ve just been an email these days), you’ll be given mole-person-level respect. You could pitch a simple way for your company to save twenty million dollars a year, and whoever’s running the meeting will be like, “Interesting, interesting. Anyone else have something they want to share?”</p>
<p>If you look like you’re in a well-lit home office, on the other hand, or maybe even a space so well-appointed someone might call it a ‘study’ (even if it’s actually just a corner of your studio apartment)–you don’t have to say anything. You can just stare into the camera all meeting long, and then, when they ask for your contribution, say, “Honestly, I think we’ve covered all we can for today. Let’s circle back next week.” And everyone else will be like, “That’s a great point!”</p>
<p>And next thing you know, you’re CEO.</p>
<p>Fine, we might’ve skipped a few steps. But the point stands. If you look like you’ve got your shit together, people will treat you like you have your shit together. And this camera will help you look like you have your shit together.</p>
<p>So get it.</p>
