There are a number of questions we could ask about how our work has been responsive to, or affected by, what has been happening in the world.</p>
<p>For today, though, let&#8217;s focus on a question about teaching sent in by a assistant professor of philosophy.</p>
<p>They write:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>How are current events being addressed in philosophy courses? I teach a contemporary moral problems course in which we cover topics like freedom of expression and immigration, but I do not quite know how (or whether) to introduce and manage discussion of the current and highly sensitive real-world events related to them. </em><em>How much of today&#8217;s news should I be bringing into the classroom? What are other professors doing? </em><em>Have they changed-up their readings to ones more relevant to the news? Have they altered their assignments? Or is it business as usual? </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Also, I feel like generally I try to teach, at least lower-level courses, in such a way that my students are uncertain of my own views. I think this makes for more effective teaching. But that &#8220;neutrality&#8221; seems not only difficult but perhaps inappropriate for many of the current events I have in mind. </em></p>
<p>This professor says they&#8217;d be grateful for constructive advice on whether and how to discuss or address some of these highly charged current events.
