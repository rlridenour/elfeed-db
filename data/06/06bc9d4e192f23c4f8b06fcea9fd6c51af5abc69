Well, actually on <i>any</i> Mac but I couldn&rsquo;t resist the symmetry. You&rsquo;re probably wondering what this post is all about. It turns out that Apple computers are inclined to autocomplete &ldquo;Emacs&rdquo; to &ldquo;eMacs&rdquo;. That, apparently, is because Apple once sold a computer—mostly to the educational market—named the &ldquo;eMac&rdquo;.

Over at the Emacs subreddit, uamplifier <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1k4zfc6/til_why_ios_autocompletes_emacs_as_emacs/">explains this</a> and provides a link to a Wikipedia article that gives the history of the eMac. All this may be marginally interesting to Emacs users on Macs but the comments provide an additional aspect.

The rest of this post is a sort of PSA for Emacs users on the Mac. The comments to uamplifier&rsquo;s post explain how to eliminate this antisocial behavior. The first thing you can do is replace the Emacs → eMacs completion. That solves the problem but you can also just disable the Apple dictionary in settings. See the comments to uamplifier&rsquo;s post for the details.

I&rsquo;ve never had this problem, probably because I don&rsquo;t use completion very much and never autocompletion. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m happy to see a solution because—due to my sensitive nature—I really hate seeing &ldquo;eMacs&rdquo; in posts. It always makes me think that the poster has been lobotomized by the eThis and eThat nonsense that is so endemic in our industry. Perhaps it&rsquo;s Apple and not these people&rsquo;s brain that are to blame. Regardless, if you&rsquo;re using Emacs on the Mac and are having Emacs turned into eMacs, take a look at uamplifier&rsquo;s post to see how to fix it.</p>
