<p>The president of the United States, on his blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seth Meyers of NBC may be the least talented person to “perform”
live in the history of television. In fact, he may be the WORST to
perform, live or otherwise. I watched his show the other night for
the first time in years. In it he talked endlessly about electric
catapults on aircraft carriers which I complain about as not being
as good as much less expensive steam catapults. On and on he went,
a truly deranged lunatic. Why does NBC waste its time and money on
a guy like this??? - NO TALENT, NO RATINGS, 100% ANTI TRUMP, WHICH
IS PROBABLY ILLEGAL!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The funny part about Trump wildly flailing that Late Night With Seth Meyers is somehow “probably illegal” is that the very sentence of the segment that so upset Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coke6nvWs30">begins with this</a>: “Donald Trump called criticism of his trip to Asia ‘almost treasonous’ and threatened to send active duty military into US cities. For more on this, it’s time for ‘A Closer Look’.”</p>
