<p>China is moving ahead with a new export licensing regime for rare earth materials, with Chinese state media issuing a seven-point rebuttal to U.S. calls to roll back the measures ahead of their November 8 start date [reuters.com#1]. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer called the controls &quot;a global supply-chain power grab&quot; and said shelving them could avert President Trump&#x27;s threat to reimpose triple‑digit tariffs on Chinese goods [reuters.com#1][japantoday.com#1]. President Trump has threatened tariffs of up to 100% beginning in November 2025, a step Beijing criticized as a double standard [france24.com#1][reuters.com#1]. Beijing says the controls align with international practices and that Washington was notified in advance, as both sides trade barbs following a September Trump–Xi phone call ahead of an expected meeting [reuters.com#1]. In response, U.S. officials are weighing deeper government involvement in critical minerals, including taking strategic stakes in companies—building on existing stakes the White House holds in several firms—an approach industry leaders say could catalyze private investment and diversify supply chains [semafor.com#1][theguardian.com#1]. Beyond minerals, both countries have also added extra port fees on cargo moving between them, a change that could unsettle freight routes [france24.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/TN36L7DmDY_F0eA-T9SX0IPcMTpf6BwX1qLB2NH7aZpZybJP00JdsFpqZZqq56_g4yKXkG7j2Mu10-Nb2AM8WcIqVczkCzO0J0Ya1Yd4ozQHUGV51jqVTcf2RQ6ymDkM6Zgf7maP1GaVBoMgRG6vBKD20HXhbxnNIBOT3ZSyyaC7kGRGXSnccV-VQoEq-Q7I2SmSe7LrcLMmlgMwboqfmnAGy5PcYCY4x3Zxu47Y_16lgLTO80-JL1c' alt='Workers handle soil containing rare earth elements at a Chinese port (file photo).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Beijing’s rationale: China argues the new export licensing mirrors practices in other major economies and says it informed Washington before announcing the controls [reuters.com#1].</li><li>Entity List spark: Beijing links the war of words to the U.S. Commerce Department’s late‑September expansion of its Entity List targeting circumvention of chipmaking equipment restrictions [reuters.com#1].</li><li>Government stakes: The White House already holds stakes in several strategic firms, including the largest U.S. rare earth miner, and may extend such control to counter China’s dominance [semafor.com#1][theguardian.com#1].</li><li>Freight costs: Both countries have introduced additional port fees on bilateral cargo, a step that could raise shipping costs and reconfigure global freight flows [france24.com#1].</li><li>Chinese critique: Chinese state media said the United States has overstated national security concerns and abused export restrictions, rejecting Washington’s framing of the dispute [reuters.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>The fact that the US government will get involved… that allows others to say, ‘Yeah, this is worthy of investment,’ - Barbara Humpton</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. Trade Representative: The new Chinese controls are a &quot;global supply-chain power grab,&quot; and Beijing could avert threatened tariffs by shelving them.
