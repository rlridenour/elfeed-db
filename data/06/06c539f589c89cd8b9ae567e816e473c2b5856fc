Cook's earnings included a &#36;3 million base salary that has remained the same since 2016, &#36;57.5 million in stock awards, &#36;12 million in performance-based cash awards, and &#36;1.76 million in other compensation, such as 401(k) contributions, life insurance premiums, vacation cash-out, security expenses, and personal air travel expenses. For efficiency and security purposes, Cook is required by Apple to use private aircraft for both business and personal travel.<br/>
<br/>
Apple set a target compensation of &#36;59 million for Cook, the same as in 2024, but Cook earned above that level through the incentive payouts that executives receive when Apple performs well.<br/>

Apple saw a chief financial officer transition in 2025, with former CFO Luca Maestri earning &#36;15.5 million in 2025 and new CFO Kevan Parekh earning &#36;22.5 million.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/tim-cook-2025-salary/">Apple CEO Tim Cook Earned &#36;74.3 Million in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-earned-74-3-million-in-2025.2475782/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
