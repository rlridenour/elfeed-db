<blockquote>
  <p>After more than a year of speculation, Apple TV+ has ordered a
fourth season of its Emmy-winning comedy Ted Lasso. The pickup
comes after co-creator and star Jason Sudeikis closed a deal to
reprise his role as the title character, the manager of the
fictional AFC Richmond soccer club in London.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dig <em>Ted Lasso</em> but this is like 0.1 percent as interesting as <strong>When are we going to get <em>Severance</em> season 3?! Gimme gimme gimme.</strong> And we haven’t even gotten to next week’s season 2 finale yet.</p>
