<p>King Charles III has initiated a formal process to remove the style, titles and honours of his younger brother, Prince Andrew, who will from now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor; Buckingham Palace said formal notice has been served to surrender his lease on Royal Lodge and he must move to private accommodation . The move follows renewed scrutiny of Andrew’s ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the publication of a posthumous memoir by accuser Virginia Giuffre, and the palace statement said the censures were necessary while also expressing sympathy with victims and survivors . Buckingham Palace framed the action as protecting the institution and distancing the royal family from the controversy, a step that has immediate consequences for Andrew’s public role and residence on the Windsor estate .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/vMbEJ0gzKCAQjhlar3jPEd4bNwHiv9e57NbfCh2rwRdzF1zq2lLAZYwjICZgy4ssqCVqP6XHZEaVEjUl81dfN5058XYH3O8pERwZe3NwooGAkkT_A1BOhr_fT2PmUqPPF_08Cw2FNgXLIO7wZxZIkcfo5wLOLCBQ96H7GETW1BUyQ7MG7JsaybQDs_6JMWIc' alt='Andrew in April; Buckingham Palace said he would lose his royal title and &#x27;will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.&#x27;' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Political response: Members of Parliament and many British newspapers publicly welcomed the king’s decision as a move to shield the institution from further reputational damage</li><li>Family dynamics: Multiple reports say Prince William played a leading role in pressing for action against his uncle, and the wider royal family supported the move</li><li>Succession status: Despite losing his royal style and honours, sources report Andrew remains eighth in the line of succession to the throne</li><li>Earlier steps: Earlier in October Andrew had already stopped using the Duke of York title as pressure mounted over his Epstein ties</li></ul><blockquote>These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.
