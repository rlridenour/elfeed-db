<p>If you’ve seen a David Byrne concert in recent years, you know that he performs with a large ensemble of musicians, each carrying their own instruments across the stage, all while moving in intricately choreographed patterns. On his current tour, Byrne and his band stopped by NPR’s studio and played a very different kind of show—a show tightly squeezed behind NPR’s Tiny Desk. As you will see above, they performed two songs (“Everybody Laughs” and “Don’t Be Like That”) from Byrne’s new album, along with two Talking Heads favorites, “(Nothing But) Flowers” and “Life During Wartime.” Enjoy!</p>
