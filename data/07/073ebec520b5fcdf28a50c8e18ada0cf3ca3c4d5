<p>A blast damaged an eight-storey residential building in Bandar Abbas, a southern Iranian port city on the Gulf coast, with local media reporting one death and multiple injuries. Iranian state television and local officials said the cause was under investigation, with a preliminary assessment later pointing to a gas leak and buildup as the likely trigger. The incident drew a rapid emergency response, with rescue and firefighting teams deployed and injured people transferred to hospital by emergency responders, according to Iranian outlets cited in coverage. The explosion also prompted speculation online about possible targeting amid heightened regional tensions, but Iranian and Israeli officials cited in reporting rejected claims of an attack or Israeli involvement.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Cj0RKHx-FDPcehpeUb8xi9VM-ih4YBEzXsqiOAkFDBOfEW-j1Kq5yA2IBs0HN3o-H-QSfaYrjuxanPgajiS64C3Q855qszV1mzfFCYHGv8E8' alt='The building where an explosion took place in the Moallem neighbourhood of Bandar Abbas, Iran on January 31.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Damage pattern: Iranian state TV described two floors destroyed, with nearby vehicles and shops also damaged on Moallem Boulevard.</li><li>False claims: Tasnim said social-media reports alleging a Revolutionary Guard navy commander was targeted were “completely false”.</li><li>Tensions backdrop: Reports noted the blast occurred amid heightened US-Iran tensions, including a US aircraft carrier group deployment after bellicose rhetoric from President Donald Trump.</li><li>Israel stance: Two Israeli officials told Reuters that Israel was not involved in the Bandar Abbas blast.</li><li>Separate incident: Iranian state-run media also reported a separate gas explosion in Ahvaz near the Iraqi border that killed four people.</li></ul><blockquote>The initial cause of the building accident in Bandar Abbas was a gas leak and buildup, leading to an explosion.
