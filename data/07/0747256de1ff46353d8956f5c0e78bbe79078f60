Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/saintecatherine/">Sainte-Catherine store</a> in Montréal, Canada has a new home at the northeast corner of Rue Sainte-Catherine and Rue de la Montagne. The location <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/the-new-apple-sainte-catherine-opens-today-in-montreal/">officially opened to the public today</a>, and the first people who visited received a complimentary tote bag and toque (the Canadian term for what Americans call a beanie), the latter of which will come in handy given Montréal's temperature is currently hovering around -15ºC (5ºF).<br/>

The store spans the first floor of a historic building that was <a href="https://retail-insider.com/retail-insider/2026/01/apple-opens-new-sainte-catherine-store-in-downtown-montreal/">extensively renovated for Apple</a>. The second and third floors are not accessible to customers.<br/>
<br/>
The new space is more than double the size of Apple's original location on Rue Saint-Catherine, which is now permanently closed. There are side-by-side counters for the Genius Bar and Apple Pickup, where customers can receive technical support and collect items they ordered through Apple's online store, respectively.<br/>

The interior design of the store is familiar, but there are a few unique elements, including the entrance and a curved wood ceiling. Apple says the store's façade blends historic Saint-Marc stone from Québec with local granite, while local copper artisans extensively restored the cornice that tops the building. <br/>
<br/>
To celebrate the store, Apple shared a custom Mac and iPhone wallpaper <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/saintecatherine/">on its website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
At the store, customers who make a purchase can receive a complimentary Apple Store shopping bag with an illustration by Montréal-based artist Catherine Potvin this Saturday, January 17, between 1:30 p.m. and 4 p.m. local time.<br/>
