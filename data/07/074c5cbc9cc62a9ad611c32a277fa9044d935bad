<blockquote>
  <p>The U.S. government and partners in Canada and Australia are
investigating the compromise of SharePoint servers, which provide
a platform for sharing and managing documents. Tens of thousands
of such servers are at risk, experts said, and Microsoft has
issued no patch for the flaw, leaving victims around the world
scrambling to respond.</p>

<p>The “zero-day” attack, so called because it targeted a previously
unknown vulnerability, is only the latest cybersecurity
embarrassment for Microsoft. Last year, the company was faulted by
a panel of U.S. government and industry experts for lapses that
enabled a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/04/02/microsoft-cyber-china-hack-report/">2023 targeted Chinese hack of U.S. government
emails</a>, including those of then-Commerce Secretary Gina
Raimondo.</p>

<p>This most recent attack compromises only those servers housed
within an organization — not those in the cloud, such as
Microsoft 365, officials said. After first suggesting that users
make modifications to or simply unplug SharePoint server programs
from the internet, the company on Sunday evening released a patch
for one version of the software. Two other versions remain
vulnerable and Microsoft said it is continuing to work to develop
a patch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Just pull the plug” — classic Microsoft security.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With access to these servers, which often connect to Outlook
email, Teams and other core services, a breach can lead to theft
of sensitive data as well as password harvesting,
Netherlands-based research company <a href="https://research.eye.security/sharepoint-under-siege/">Eye Security noted</a>.
What’s also alarming, researchers said, is that the hackers have
gained access to keys that may allow them to regain entry even
after a system is patched. “So pushing out a patch on Monday or
Tuesday doesn’t help anybody who’s been compromised in the past 72
hours,” said one researcher, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity because a federal investigation is ongoing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds bad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nonprofit Center for Internet Security, which staffs an
information-sharing group for state and local governments,
notified about 100 organizations that they were vulnerable and
potentially compromised, said Randy Rose, the organization’s vice
president. Those warned included public schools and universities.
The process took six hours Saturday night — much longer than it
otherwise would have, because the threat-intelligence and
incident-response teams have been cut by 65 percent as CISA
slashed funding, Rose said.</p>
