<p>She&#8217;s the girl that makes the thing that drills the hole that holds the spring<br />
That drives the rod that turns the knob that works the thingumebob,<br />
And it&#8217;s the girl that makes the thing that holds that oil that oils the ring<br />
That works the thingumebob THAT&#8217;S GOING TO WIN THE WAR!</p>
