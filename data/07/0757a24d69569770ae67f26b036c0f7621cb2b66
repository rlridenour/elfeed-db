<p>President Trump warned that the US would impose a 100% tariff on all Canadian goods if Canada proceeds with what he described as a trade deal with China, arguing Beijing could use Canada to route products into the US. Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney responded that Canada has “no intention” of pursuing a free trade agreement with China and said recent discussions with Beijing were limited to easing tariffs in a few sectors. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent separately said the US would apply full tariffs if Ottawa finalises a China trade deal, underscoring the administration’s pressure on Canada to align trade policy with Washington. Despite the sharp rhetoric, Carney framed the narrower tariff adjustments as a practical step to reduce friction and stabilize trade in specific goods.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/T-Bni-Pkc9l2nWLWJvGcZ3Vi-Y-t8Bk2vQVQ54YVHuAMxUTCwjwMxg60aw_MLZvofUcvIQdjTn3rvcA4bApdiDgNGs4O9vj2CmNp8a3q3WMUoxbfM5KEvB3csHWfFPsMd7XLKCuiqX1y59o6F5G-CyfUWlPWUZnYJug' alt='Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney, who says Canada is not pursuing a free trade deal with China.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>USMCA constraint: Carney said the US-Canada-Mexico trade agreement includes commitments not to pursue free trade agreements with “non-market economies” without prior notification, and he said Canada does not intend to do so with China.</li><li>Recent tariff cycle: Canada imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles and 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium in 2024, and China responded with 100% import taxes on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood, according to Carney’s account.</li><li>EV import cap: Carney said Canada would set an initial annual cap of 49,000 Chinese EVs entering Canada at a 6.1% tariff rate as part of the sector-specific adjustments.</li><li>Trump’s rationale: Trump said he would not allow Canada to become a “Drop Off Port” for Chinese goods to enter the US, tying the threatened tariff to concerns about transshipment.</li><li>US officials’ warning: Bessent warned the US would apply “full tariffs” if Ottawa finalises a China trade deal, echoing the administration’s readiness to escalate trade pressure.</li></ul><blockquote>We have no intention of doing that with China or any other non-market economy - Mark Carney</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US President Donald Trump: Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on all Canadian goods if Canada makes a trade deal with China, arguing China would try to use Canada to get products into the US.
