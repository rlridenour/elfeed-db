<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s new Liquid Glass interface design brings transparency and
blur effects to all Apple operating systems, but many users find
it distracting or difficult to read. Here’s how to control its
effects and make your interface more usable. Although the relevant
Accessibility settings are quite similar across macOS, iOS,
watchOS, and tvOS, I separate them because they offer different
levels of utility in each.</p>

<p>Comprehensive, illustrated overview of the various Accessibility settings (and, on MacOS 26 Tahoe, hidden command-line <code>defaults</code> settings) that let you adjust the transparency and contrast of Liquid Glass across the various Apple OS 26 interfaces. A useful guide for today — and, I bet, a useful look back at the first versions of Liquid Glass for the future.</p>
