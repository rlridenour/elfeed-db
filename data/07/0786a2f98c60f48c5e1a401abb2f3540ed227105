Mitch Randall’s sermon Sunday was beautiful, the thought of being immersed in God’s love brought to mind both the final scene of Bergman’s  <i>Through A Glass Darkly</i> and the end of the “Cana of Galilee” chapter in  <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>.

 <p>
Father,
</p>

 <p>
I remember wearing a white robe, <br></br>
when I felt the water <br></br>
slipping over my face.
</p>

 <p>
Even through the water, <br></br>
I could hear the voice say, <br></br>
“Buried with him in baptism, <br></br>
and raised to walk in new life.”
</p>

 <p>
But it seems that the well of grace <br></br>
has since run dry, <br></br>
and the springs of faith <br></br>
have ceased to flow.
</p>

 <p>
Nothing is left <br></br>
but a dry, dusty heart <br></br>
and an old and bitter soul.
</p>

 <p>
But a heart can be cleansed, <br></br>
and a soul can be restored, <br></br>
indeed, all things become new <br></br>
when immersed in the ocean of your love.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
