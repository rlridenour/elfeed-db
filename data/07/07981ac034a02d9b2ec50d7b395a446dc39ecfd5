Sometimes, we may want a few examples of a Clojure API for inspiration while developing, especially when reading other people&#39;s or open source code.</p>
<p>
With <a href="https://cider.mx/">Cider</a> in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, we can run <code class="verbatim">M-x cider-doc</code> to see the docstring for the symbol. We can even use <code class="verbatim">M-x cider-clojuredocs</code> for some examples if the symbol is from the language core.</p>

I happened to find this command recently. I bet I was not the only one who didn&#39;t know it, thus I&#39;m sharing.</p>
