<p>During the Battle of Waterloo, a cannon shot struck the right leg of Henry Paget, Second Earl of Uxbridge, prompting this quintessentially British exchange:</p>
<p>Uxbridge: By God, sir, I&#8217;ve lost my leg!</p>
<p>Wellington: By God, sir, so you have!</p>
<p>That may be apocryphal, but <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2008/11/24/one-foot-in-the-grave/">the leg went on to a colorful career of its own</a>.</p>
<p>The single most British conversation in the history of human civilization, <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2015/02/08/podcast-episode-45-crossing-africa-for-love/">in my judgment</a>, took place on the Upper Nile in 1899, when starving explorer Ewart Grogan stumbled out of the bush and surprised one Captain Dunn, medical officer of a British exploratory expedition:</p>
<p>Dunn: How do you do?</p>
<p>Grogan: Oh, very fit thanks; how are you? Had any sport?</p>
<p>Dunn: Oh pretty fair, but there is nothing much here. Have a drink? You must be hungry; I&#8217;ll hurry on lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not until the two men had almost finished the meal that Dunn thought it excusable to enquire about the identity and provenance of his guest.&#8221;</p>
