<p>Tho&#8217; my verse is exact,<br />
Tho&#8217; it flawlessly flows,<br />
As a matter of fact<br />
I would rather write prose.</p>
<p>While my harp is in tune,<br />
And I sing like the birds,<br />
I would really as soon<br />
Write in straightaway words.</p>
<p>Tho&#8217; my songs are as sweet<br />
As Apollo e&#8217;er piped,<br />
And my lines are as neat<br />
As have ever been typed,</p>
<p>I would rather write prose &#8212;<br />
I prefer it to rime;<br />
It&#8217;s less hard to compose,<br />
And it takes me less time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that be the case,&#8221;<br />
You are moved to inquire,<br />
&#8220;Why appropriate space<br />
For extolling your lyre?&#8221;</p>
<p>I can only reply<br />
That this form I elect<br />
&#8216;Cause it pleases the eye,<br />
And I like the effect.</p>
