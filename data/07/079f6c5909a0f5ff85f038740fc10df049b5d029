<p>Longtime readers of this blog know I’m a sucker for calendrical calculations. So I couldn’t stop myself from doing some after reading <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/study-how-the-maya-created-such-accurate-eclipse-tables/">this article</a> by Jennifer Ouellette at Ars Technica.</p>
<p>The article covers <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt9039">a recent paper</a> on the Dresden Codex, one of the few surviving documents from the Maya civilization. The paragraph that caught my eye was this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The paper’s authors] concluded that the codex’s eclipse tables evolved from a more general table of successive lunar months. The length of a 405-month lunar cycle (11,960 days) aligned much better with a 260-day calendar (46 × 260 = 11,960) than with solar or lunar eclipse cycles. This suggests that the Maya daykeepers figured out that 405 new moons almost always came out equivalent to 46 260-day periods, knowledge the Maya used to accurately predict the dates of full and new moons over 405 successive lunar dates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many calendrical calculations involve cycles that are close integer approximations of orbital phenomena whose periods are definitely not integers. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle">Metonic cycle</a> is a good example: there are almost exactly 235 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#Synodic_month">synodic months</a> in 19 years, so the dates of new moons (and all the other phases) this year match the dates of new moons back in 2006. “Match” has to be given some slack here; they match within 12 hours or so.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Maya used a few calendars, one of them being the 260-day divinatory calendar mentioned in the quote above. The integral approximation in this case is that 46 of these 260-day cycles match pretty well with 405 synodic months.</p>
<p>How well? The average synodic month is 29.53059 days long (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month#Synodic_month">the Wikipedia article</a>), so 405 of them add up to 11,959.9 days, which is a pretty good match. It’s off by just a couple of hours over a cycle of nearly 33 years.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how well this works for specific cycles, not just on average. So I used Mathematica’s <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MoonPhaseDate.html"><code>MoonPhaseDate</code></a> function to calculate the dates of new moons over about five centuries, from 1502 through 2025. This gave me 6,480 (405 × 16) synodic months, and I could work out the lengths of all the 405-month cycles within that period. I’ll show all the Mathematica code at the end of the post.</p>
<p>First, the shortest synodic month in this period was 29.2719 days and the longest was 29.8326 days, a range of about 13½ hours. The mean was 29.5306 days, which matched the value from Wikipedia and its sources.</p>
<p>I then calculated the lengths of all the 405-month periods in this range: from the first new moon in the list to the 406th, from the second to the 407th, and so on. The results were a minimum of 11,959.5 days, a maximum of 11,960.3 days, and a mean of 11,959.9 days (consistent with the value calculated above).</p>
<p>These are good results but not perfect, and the Maya knew that. They made adjustments to their calendar tables, based on observations, and thereby maintained the accuracy they wanted.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve done this, I feel like going through <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt9039">the paper</a> to look for more fun calculations.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The calculations summarized above were done in two Mathematica notebooks. The first used the <code>MoonPhaseDate</code> command repeatedly to build a list of all the new moons from 1502 through 2025 and save them to a file. Here it is:</p>

<p>Because <code>MoonPhaseDate</code> returns the next new moon after the given date, the <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/For.html"><code>For</code></a> loop builds the list by getting the day after the last new moon, calculating the next new moon after that, and appending it to the end of the list. It’s a command that takes little time to write but a lot of time to execute—over a minute on my MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro chip. That’s why the last command in the notebook saves the <code>newmoons</code> list to a file. The notebook that does all the manipulations of the list could run quickly by just reading that list in from the saved file.</p>
<p>I don’t know any of the details of how <code>MoonPhaseDate</code> works or how accurate it is, but I assume it’s less accurate for dates further away from today. That’s why the period over which I had it calculate the new moons was well after the peak of the Maya civilization.</p>
<p>The second notebook starts by reading in the <code>newmoons.wl</code> file—a plain text file with a single Mathematica command that’s nearly 2 MB in size—and then goes on to calculate the lengths of each synodic month and each 405-month cycle. The statistics come from the <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Min.html"><code>Min</code></a>, <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Max.html"><code>Max</code></a>, and <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Mean.html"><code>Mean</code></a> functions.</p>
