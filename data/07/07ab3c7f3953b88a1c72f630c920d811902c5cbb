<p>Japan and China have entered a sharp diplomatic dispute after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a Chinese attack on Taiwan could create a “survival‑threatening” situation that might permit Japan to exercise collective self‑defence, remarks that Beijing has publicly rebuked as provocative. In response, China issued travel and education advisories urging its citizens to avoid Japan and three major Chinese carriers offered refunds or free itinerary changes for Japan trips through year‑end, moves that have hit tourism and retail sentiment in Tokyo. The dispute has included military and maritime probes — Japan said it scrambled jets after spotting a suspected Chinese drone near a southern island and Beijing has dispatched coast guard ships near disputed islands — even as Tokyo says communication channels remain open and plans high‑level dialogue to calm tensions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/MQ6zZEora8Un0bre7xKQnc8BMNMS0J6BIjYWbLauFiJlWtQpwB7ldcigwhUCF_QYC2_tjdQcEF02e_DUVB1KyDNIjbxymdXNIMFMpxlrWAnS' alt='Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara holds a press conference at the Prime Minister’s Office in Tokyo on November 17, 2025. — AFP' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ticket cancellations: Chinese carriers and travel advisories coincided with about 491,000 Japan‑bound ticket cancellations, roughly one‑third of bookings, according to independent aviation analysis.</li><li>Market fallout: Retail and tourism stocks in Tokyo slid after Beijing&#x27;s advisory, with department store Takashimaya and discount retailer Pan Pacific/Don Quijote among firms hit.</li><li>Domestic politics: Takaichi has declined to retract her parliamentary remark and her aides say backing down would alienate conservative supporters, complicating Japan&#x27;s domestic handling of the spat.</li><li>Public reaction in China: Chinese citizens showed mixed responses to Beijing&#x27;s travel and education warnings: some heeded official caution while others downplayed the risk ahead of peak travel season.</li><li>Taiwan&#x27;s stance: Taiwan publicly welcomed Tokyo&#x27;s comments as supportive and criticized Beijing&#x27;s response as harming regional stability.</li></ul><blockquote>We will continue watching developments closely and making the appropriate response - Minoru Kihara</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Japan government: Tokyo says channels of communication with China are open and will press for dialogue while monitoring developments closely, but has not accepted Beijing&#x27;s demand that the prime minister retract her remark.
