<p>I'm neither a burger expert nor a connoisseur of any kind, yet I sure have a lot of fun smashing burgers at home. Needless to say, I shamelessly enjoy gobbling them too!</p>

<p>I'll share details on how I smash my burgers, but here's a quick ingredient list, if that's all you need.</p>

<h2>The calling</h2>
<p>My quest to smash burgers at home didn't start until earlier this year, while watching the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/">The Menu</a>. I just could't stop <a href="https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/109734285674122246">craving the burger</a> from that scene, so I set out to start smashing my own.</p>

<h2>The gear</h2>
<p>Don't rush to buy anything fancy. Your existing gear will likely do the job just fine. I'd say try a few things out and only upgrade when needed. I'll share the gear I use and where I felt I needed tweaking.</p>
<h2>Skillet</h2>
<p>While I didn't have a griddle at home, I did have a couple of trusty <a href="https://www.lodgecastiron.com/">Lodge</a> <strong>skillets</strong> (<a href="https://www.lodgecastiron.com/product/round-cast-iron-classic-skillet?sku=L8SK3">cast iron</a> and <a href="https://www.lodgecastiron.com/product/carbon-steel-skillet?sku=CRS12">carbon steel</a>). Both work great for burgers, though I have a slight preference for the carbon steel one, as it's the bigger of the two and gives a little more room for manoeuvring, specially when smashing two burgers at a time.</p>

<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/carbon.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Heat the skillet up and add a little oil. If the oil starts smoking, be quick to drop the patties and start smashing.</p>
<h2>Grill Spatula (too big/stiff for skillet)</h2>
<p>Somewhat inspired by the film, I got myself a wide spatula so I could firmly press those patties against the skillet, and to flip of course.</p>
<p>While this kind of spatula may work well on a spacious griddle, I felt constrained on a relatively small cast iron. Specially when flipping. I went looking for an alternative.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/spatula.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Spatula + smasher (my winning combo)</h2>
<p>Over at the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/castiron/">r/castiron</a> subreddit, I discovered fish spatulas. They are fairly agile on cast irons but also work great for loosening burger patties before flipping.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/ready.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>While effective for flipping, fish spatulas are obviously no good for smashing. So I got myself a burger smasher. This combo worked well for me.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/smash.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>When smashing, use greaseproof paper to prevent the patties from sticking to the smasher.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>While I've drawn inspiration from others, I've landed on my own preferred ingredients. I'm sure that will continue changing over time. Pick and choose as your heart desires.</p>
<h2>Minced/ground beef</h2>
<p>Minced beef with higher fat content (around 20-30%) is often recommended for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flavour: Fat equals flavour in cooking. The higher fat content will melt during cooking and become 'self-basting', resulting in a juicier and more flavourful burger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Texture: The fat in the beef melts under heat, helping the burger achieve a crispy, caramelized exterior known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">Maillard reaction</a>, which contrasts nicely against the soft, juicy interior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the UK, I can typically find minced beef with 15%-20% fat content at the main supermarkets.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/pattie.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Be sure to salt and pepper to taste (as in picture) on one side. Once flipped on pan, salt and pepper the other side.</p>
<h2>Bacon</h2>
<p>I tend to prefer smoked streaky bacon, but hey these will be your burgers. Your burgers, your rules.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/streaky.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Buns (brioche)</h2>
<p>I hear potato buns are great for burgers. I've yet to try them. So far, I've settled for brioche. I happen to find these near me, so I've gone with them.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/brioche.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Butter the buns and brown on the skillet for a minute. Check the buns often. Brioche buns can burn quickly.</p>
<h2>American cheese</h2>
<p>American cheese is often the burger cheese of choice.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/american-cheese.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>While American cheese isn't widely available in the UK, the individually wrapped orange-looking cheddar cheese slices work just fine.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/cheese.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Toppings</h2>
<p>I like my burgers with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and occasionally jalapeños. For pickles, I typically just take cornichons and slice them up.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/toppings_x0.30.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Burger sauce (chipotle/garlic/mayo)</h2>
<p>While classic burger sauce is often made with mayo, ketchup, pickles, and mustard, I've gone fairly rogue here.</p>
<p>You see, I love chipotle mayo. I'm also a fan of garlic mayo, so I figured why not both? Turns out these three ingredients work great together.</p>
<p>I like to draw out the flavours by first mixing the garlic and chipotle with a little hot water.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 garlic clove.</li>
<li>2 teaspoons of chipotle powder.</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of hot water.</li>
<li>Pinch of salt.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/sauce1.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/sauce2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/sauce3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>…and then thicken with mayo.</p>
<ul>
<li>1/4 cup of mayo.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/sauce4.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/sauce5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These are very rough measurements, tweak to your preference. Make more garlicky, spicier, or soften things by adding garlic, chipotle, or mayo.</p>
<h2>Assembling</h2>
<p>I like to assemble in the following order from the bottom bun up.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sauce on bottom bun.</li>
<li>Lettuce.</li>
<li>Tomatoes.</li>
<li>Onions.</li>
<li>2 patties (melted cheese on both).</li>
<li>Bacon.</li>
<li>Pickles.</li>
<li>Jalapeños.</li>
<li>Sauce on top bun (oops, I forgot in the picture).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/open.png" alt=""></p>
<p>…and here's the final product.</p>
