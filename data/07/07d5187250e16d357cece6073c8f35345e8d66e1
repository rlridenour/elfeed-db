<p>My 47th birthday was a few days ago. 11 years ago, I wrote a post <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2014/07/19/36-years-in-this-skin/">on my birthday</a>, detailing my addiction and recovery, and while I won&rsquo;t go into the same points again, I thought I&rsquo;d write something in the same vein.</p>

<p>Shortly after my last (third) stint in rehab in my early 20s, I had moved back in with my parents while I found my footing. In the depths of bipolar depression (undiagnosed at the time), I went into the basement, coiled a coat hanger into a spiral, heated it to white hot with a blow torch, and pressed it into my forearm. I almost passed out from the pain, but it was, in lieu of proper treatment, what I needed at the time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been extremely sensitive to sensation, both pleasurable and painful. It&rsquo;s part of why drugs always sat well with me &mdash; they were fun, but also an escape from physical and emotional pain. And I&rsquo;ve had lots of both my whole life.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t shy away from pain &mdash; I got tattoos, got in fights, slammed around in mosh pits, and all of that, but I always had drugs to keep me from feeling the brunt of it. But here I was, stone cold sober, seeking out the pain I&rsquo;d always sought to numb. It was clarifying, cathartic, and I felt peace like I hadn&rsquo;t in a long time.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, we used to have those Just Say No films shown to us. They made smoking look cool enough that I started when I was 12. But what really got me was one on heroin and cocaine. The &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; results they portrayed looked appealing to me at 8 or 9 years old. I decided early on that when I could get drugs, I would. It would narrow my world down to worrying about just one thing, and that was appealing. Nancy Reagan made sure I knew it would be painful, but I wanted it.</p>

<p>It was, in essence, about focus. I had so many internal voices and contradictions that I just sought simplicity. And addiction offered that. Intense pain offers that as well. It&rsquo;s clarifying. Especially pain you can control when you can&rsquo;t control anything else.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve been clean for over 20 years, I&rsquo;ve been through years of therapy, and I have diagnoses and treatments for my various disorders. I don&rsquo;t seek out pain anymore. I don&rsquo;t need it the way I used to. Now I avoid it when I can, and have healthier ways of dealing with what I can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I still have that brand on my arm, though. I look at it as a symbol of a painful time in my life, but the scar also represents healing to me. Of dealing with pain &mdash; depression, uncertainty, loss &mdash; and finding my way through it. Pain changes you, and it leaves a mark, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to control you.</p>

<p>Both pain and pleasure are temporary. I do a pretty good job of remembering pleasure, but I&rsquo;m wont to forget pain. And that&rsquo;s a good way to keep hurting yourself. This brand is something I can&rsquo;t forget, and is a good reminder about recovery the temporary nature of pain.</p>

<p>When my partner, Elle, knit a raccoon (my favorite animal) for me, they knit a matching brand into its right foreleg. It meant so much to me, representing the same pain and healing that my own brand does, and it reminds me that I&rsquo;m not alone. I love it (and them) more than I can say.</p>
