<p>A rare full-length portrait by Gustav Klimt, Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer, sold at Sotheby’s in New York on Tuesday for $236.4 million, making it the second most expensive artwork ever auctioned and the most expensive modern work sold at auction. The six‑foot painting, long held in the Leonard A. Lauder collection, drew sustained competitive bidding before the unidentified buyer secured the lot. The same evening, Maurizio Cattelan’s satirical solid‑gold toilet &#x27;America&#x27; also fetched $12.1 million, underscoring intense demand at the top of the market for museum‑calibre and headline lots.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/jOqIbjoV8Z6R-PmL7xmdyYqPXlpmQiVtJV7W3n7Dz5IA-pi8SbA74zsOjyiZiK9svZniTSqjP03llqO-ErDppl9WxJZcxCOKMC75sg9bm38x4o8Xr0v7VKFcGOyIEa0ayGahTLJQKxgDu2k9Fhp4MXCDDcb9XPq2s-XTZWMsIQVg-lGSe8pwBBv2PhWi0waOCD6rVLXysLlReQyGKBq3U7nvA42BQOBP_Dp5B8QaU75W8PW-n4R-61mp_mWYsnlf-3i5XhUhDck73299XQ' alt='&#x27;Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer&#x27; by Gustav Klimt from the collection of Estée Lauder cosmetics heir Leonard A.
