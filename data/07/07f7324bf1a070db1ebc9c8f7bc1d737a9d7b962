One of my chief desires in upgrading my org-mode recently was to be able to export into markdown, as described in the documentation. Imagine my surprise when the export list didn&rsquo;t mention it, it didn&rsquo;t appear to be an extra package, and the shortcut didn&rsquo;t work. Thankfully, a user on Stack Overflow had the answer. In short, the plethora of org-mode export options listed here are not all loaded to begin with.
