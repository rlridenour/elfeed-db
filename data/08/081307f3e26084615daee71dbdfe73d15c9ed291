Affected employees received notice over the past couple of weeks, and positions eliminated include account managers for large businesses, schools, and government agencies, plus staff at Apple's briefing centers for major customers. Employees were reportedly surprised by the layoffs, but they are able to apply for other positions within Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple told <em>Bloomberg</em> that it is making changes in its sales team to better connect with customers.<br/>
<blockquote>To connect with even more customers, we are making some changes in our sales team that affect a small number of roles. We are continuing to hire and those employees can apply for new roles.</blockquote><br/>
While Apple says it is restructuring some of the sales team, affected employees apparently believe that Apple wants to move more sales to third-party retailers. Pushing sales through retailers allows Apple to save money by cutting salary costs.<br/>

Apple is giving employees over a month to find a new role. Those who haven't gotten another position in the company by January 20 will receive a severance package.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/apple-eliminates-sales-roles/">Rare Layoffs at Apple Impact Dozens in Sales Roles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rare-layoffs-at-apple-impact-dozens-in-sales-roles.2471833/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
