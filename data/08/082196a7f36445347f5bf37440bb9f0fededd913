<p>Journelly keeps getting updated with good features. One of the latest features I noticed (I&rsquo;m not sure if it was part of the latest patch) is that locations tagged with entries can be revisited in iOS Maps from the app. This makes Journelly a good spot to save locations and integrate them with personal memories, to be revisited later on the map. I would like to use this (instead of, say, a saved of locations on Google Maps), but I can&rsquo;t -  for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first one, which I can work around, is that the list of entries on Journelly quickly becomes long, and finding where you were a couple of weeks ago requires some scrolling. While Journelly has a search option, I usually don&rsquo;t remember the name of the place I&rsquo;m searching for, which is why I&rsquo;m searching for it in the first place. Still, I could probably look for who I was with at the time, or even better, use the tagging feature, which was introduced a couple of weeks ago, for, say, &ldquo;#cafes&rdquo; to filter down cafes only.</p>
<p>The other issue is more challenging: I don&rsquo;t keep my notes in Journelly. I keep refiling my entries into my main journal file. That file, while still on my Mac, is not synced with iCloud. Call me paranoid, but I don&rsquo;t trust Apple&rsquo;s iCloud with my personal notes along with my pictures throughout the years. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Apple just has a better PR department than Google and Microsoft, and they only care about their users' privacy as long as it&rsquo;s what looks good in the news. Because of that, I am not comfortable with Journelly being my archive of notes. There could be other options besides iCloud, but as far as I know, they all involve <em>a</em> cloud company somewhere. On Android and macOS, I still use the excellent Syncthing, which doesn&rsquo;t involve any cloud storage. However, Syncthing doesn&rsquo;t work on iOS, so I&rsquo;m out of luck.</p>
<p>Besides these two issues (which have nothing to do with the app), the app is terrific. It&rsquo;s amazing how polished and responsive it is.</p>
