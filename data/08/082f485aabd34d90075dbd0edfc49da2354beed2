The grand re-opening will take place at 10 a.m. local time:<blockquote>We're making moves. Come with us. Apple La Encantada opens June 14, at 10:00 a.m.</blockquote>Apple La Encantada first opened in 2004, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/three-apple-stores-moving-this-weekend/">closed in November 2024</a> for renovations. Apple opened a temporary store at the outdoor mall in the interim, and now the original location will be reopening with a modern design and a larger layout than before.<br/>

We have not seen any photos of the remodeled store, but expect more wood paneling and an Apple Pickup station for online orders.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-store-updated-design-arizona/">Apple Store With Updated Design Opening in Arizona Later This Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-with-updated-design-opening-in-arizona-later-this-week.2458416/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
