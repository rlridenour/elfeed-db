<blockquote>
  <p>The European Union is set to slap Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta with a
fine that could stretch to $1 billion or more for allegedly
violating its strict antitrust rules, The Post has learned — setting up a possible showdown with President Trump, who has
compared the EU’s penalties to “overseas extortion.”</p>

<p>The European Commission, the EU’s antitrust watchdog, is
expected to conclude that Meta is not in compliance with the
Digital Markets Act, sources close to the situation told The
Post on Monday. [...] The fine is expected to be hundreds of
millions of dollars and potentially more than $1 billion, the
sources said. [...]</p>

<p>Apple is also in the EU’s crosshairs and a fine against the iPhone
maker could be announced this week or next week, the sources said.
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-likely-impose-modest-fines-apple-meta-over-dma-breaches-sources-say-2025-03-10/">Reuters reported that Apple and Meta</a>
were likely to face “modest fines” for DMA breaches. EU antitrust
chief Theresa Ribera previously said a decision on enforcement
actions for both companies was coming in March.</p>
