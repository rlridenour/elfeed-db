<p>Thousands of people across Mexico, led initially by self-styled &quot;Gen Z&quot; organisers, marched on Saturday in response to the public killing of Uruapan mayor Carlos Manzo earlier this month, denouncing rising violence, corruption and impunity. In Mexico City a large demonstration reached the Zócalo and the National Palace before clashes with riot police left at least 120 people injured — most of them police officers — and about 20 people arrested, according to officials and multiple news reports. Protesters said the government has failed to curb organised crime, while President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned the violence; authorities used tear gas to clear parts of the square and opened investigations into several incidents during the rally.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/AxIFvys1ceBaovqpvY_ERjPMe-a1PIzGFmLthiQrEn0Eb2CSsYf3ER9ltrlf1to_WpA3PZxHR9ILeU7b1zuksjoZEkJEf8L62YLfcfFtyt_es72JVZKGYyzqW3EJSDVVJoXpWoIRxNkDraybOTwQDmmzxBTqcqQCgw_K6Kmsk36K4YLzqewOetXK1fVYnPCoO0CqeW0-tSy4hQ' alt='Protesters and police clashed in Mexico City on Saturday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Geographic spread: Demonstrations took place in multiple cities beyond Mexico City, including marches in Michoacán (where Uruapan is located) and rallies in Guadalajara, showing the protest reached regional strongholds of anger over the mayor’s killing</li><li>Who joined: What began as youth-led, social-media driven actions drew strong backing from older opposition supporters and groups linked to the ‘Sombrero Movement,’ broadening turnout across age groups</li><li>Tactics and escalation: Several accounts and video footage reported masked individuals breaking through metal barriers, throwing stones, and clashing with police — after which officers deployed tear gas to disperse parts of the crowd</li><li>Official reactions: Mexico City security officials said the mobilisation was peaceful for hours before a subset of hooded protesters began violent acts, prompting arrests for theft and assault and an investigation into a reported assault on a journalist</li></ul><blockquote>This is one of the most corrupt governments we’ve ever had. - Valentina Ramirez</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Gen Z protesters / demonstrators: Protesters said they were marching to denounce rising violence, corruption and impunity following the public killing of an anti-crime mayor.
