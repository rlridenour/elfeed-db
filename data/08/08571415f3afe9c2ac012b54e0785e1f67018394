The first iOS 26 public beta should arrive this week, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>

"All indications are that iOS 26 should go into the public beta phase this coming week," said Gurman, in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In a social media post last week, Gurman said that the iOS 26 public beta would likely be released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/ios-26-public-beta-release-date/">on or around Wednesday, July 23</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously announced that a public beta of iOS 26 would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-software-26-public-beta-july/">available in July</a>, but it did not provide a more specific timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
The first public betas of iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and HomePod software 26 should be released alongside the iOS 26 public beta, and Apple is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/15/airpods-firmware-public-betas/">planning to offer a public beta of its next major AirPods firmware update</a> for the first time. Apple does not plan to offer a visionOS 26 public beta, though, according to its beta website.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can sign up to be a member of the <a href="https://beta.apple.com/">Apple Beta Software Program</a>, for free, and gain access to the public betas for testing. As always, we highly recommend backing up your devices before installing beta software, in case of issues.<br/>
<br/>
All of the updates are already available <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/ios-26-beta-3-everything-new/">in developer beta</a>. A few years ago, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/developer-betas-free-to-download/">dropped the requirement</a> to pay &#36;99 per year for an Apple Developer Program membership in order to access the developer betas, but you <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-26-developer-beta-iphone/">still need to have an Apple Developer account</a>. Technically, though, the public should wait for the public betas.<br/>
<br/>
Looking ahead, the first iOS 27 rumor has surfaced.<br/>
<br/>
According to Gurman, Apple will formally kick off development of iOS 27 soon, and the company plans to prioritize software features that are tailored for the long-rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/foldable-iphone-galaxy-z-fold-8-crease-free/">foldable iPhone</a>. That device is expected to launch in the second half of next year.<br/>
