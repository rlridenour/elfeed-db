Siri launched on the iPhone 4S all the way back in 2011, and yet it still struggles to answer some of the most basic questions.<br/>

<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/hey-siri-what-month-is-it"><em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber today highlighted</a> a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1jehkpm/apple_intelligence_this_apple_intelligence_that/">recent post from a Reddit user</a> who asked Siri what month it is, only for Siri to respond that it does not understand. This is a frustrating experience that many iPhone users are all too familiar with, as evidenced by the dozens of replies to the post that provide similar examples of Siri being useless.<br/>

Apple recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">delayed the more personalized version of Siri</a> that it previewed at WWDC last year, with the reported reason being that the new features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/14/apple-siri-team-reassurance/">did not work reliably enough</a>. But, the regular Siri that we already have is frustratingly bad, so perhaps Apple should focus on fixing that core before adding new features on top.<br/>
