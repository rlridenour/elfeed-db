<p>From now on, &#8220;new submissions of manuscripts that are published as research articles in <i>Nature</i> will automatically include a link to the reviewers’ reports and author responses.&#8221;<span id="more-54128"></span></p>

<p>The identity of the reviewers will not be revealed, unless the reviewers themselves choose otherwise.</p>
<p>For several years, authors at <em>Nature</em> have had the option to have the peer-review file for the manuscript accompany their publication. Making this the standard mode of publication, <em>Nature</em>&#8216;s editors <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01880-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write</a>, helps achieve their aim &#8220;to open up what many see as the ‘black box’ of science, shedding light on how a research paper is made. This serves to increase transparency and (we hope) to build trust in the scientific process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this &#8220;open&#8221; or &#8220;transparent&#8221; peer review a model that should be standard for philosophy journals ? There are a few reasons in favor:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;shedding light&#8221; on the process (e.g., makes the collaborative aspects of philosophy more visible)</li>
<li>better record of the sources of ideas/moves for intellectual history (especially if the reviewers choose to reveal their identity)</li>
<li>better understanding of why a paper is the way it is</li>
<li>possible incentive for better peer-reviewer behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>Discussion welcome.
