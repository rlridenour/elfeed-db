<p>Bangladesh votes in national elections on Thursday—the first nationwide ballot since a student-led movement ousted then–Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024. Interim chief Muhammad Yunus has called for calm, broad participation as authorities roll out heavy security. For many voters, the election is a chance to rebuild democratic institutions after years of political turbulence. The campaign has also brought worries about public order, press freedom, and the rising influence of Islamist parties into sharper focus. Several reports say Jamaat-e-Islami—suppressed under Hasina—may win a larger share of the vote, unsettling some activists who fear setbacks on women’s rights and social freedoms.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PSSbUgnw_8XR7hzi3SGrvvD5qPM8LNc1wr3i9xGijGVgUqwlRiLEUcCmyaZvilkwrl0AK0UyKwyG8qbiQMDqyRYw6cNwuTV8MotgEnvmsC259IVGyNDNMYzGOTvOEL0PGIgcBl_qpv06NNXXB3YZlaaJwQcqOrq0bvdKTe_QS4p2EsozSXrtPQjsCE81w_dv0IGZKKJiD823kFFmSHPCJ5t7WTVDJWQVfJ9d4qT1lAIHYw' alt='Dhaka prepares for Thursday’s national election.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Exile politics: The Financial Times says Tarique Rahman, after 17 years in exile, is angling for a leadership role as the vote nears, with rivals that include a coalition of mainly Islamist parties.</li><li>First “free and fair” pledge: The Guardian says Thursday’s polls are being billed as the first free and fair national election in about 17 years, after Hasina’s fall in 2024.</li><li>Women mobilize: Ahead of the vote, women in Dhaka held torch-lit marches for equality, worried that a stronger Islamist showing could roll back freedoms.</li><li>Reform expectations: The Christian Science Monitor reports that some of the interim government’s more ambitious goals have fallen short since Hasina’s ouster, making the election a test of whether a broader democratic reset is still within reach.</li><li>India factor: The Hindu reports that anti-India sentiment has become both “shield and sword” on the trail, with candidates using “pro-India” accusations to hit opponents.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Interim government (Muhammad Yunus): Yunus says his administration will quickly hand power to an elected government once results are in.
