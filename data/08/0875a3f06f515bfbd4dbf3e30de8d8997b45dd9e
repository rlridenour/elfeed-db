Old-school blogger
</p>

<p>
[timeline showing different strands braided together]
</p>

<p>
I started blogging in 2001 (really, more like 2002), as a university student who had started playing around enjoyed learning out loud. Both blogging and Emacs continued through:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>teaching computer science</li>
<li>going on a technical internship in Japan</li>
<li>taking up graduate studies</li>
<li>working at IBM</li>
<li>experimenting with consulting and semi-retirement</li>
<li>parenting</li>
</ul>

<p>
directly related to blogging: grad studies, working, experimenting
</p>

<p>
It's wonderful having such a long archive. I can trace my growth. I've changed a lot over the past 24 years. I miss being so optimistic and energetic, but who I am now and who I'm becoming are also okay.
</p>

<p>
[drawing of the butterfly life cycle]
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>caterpillar</li>
<li>chrysalis: We're in this messy stage where I digest myself and move my insides around</li>
<li>butterfly: maybe someday</li>
</ul>

<p>
Learning out loud by blogging:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Springboard: Writing as I learn means I can use my notes to pick up from where I left off.</li>
<li>Sometimes my notes help other people.</li>
<li>Sometimes people share what they've been learning.</li>
<li>Writing helps me gather my tribe.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Questions to explore:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What do I want to learn? How?</li>
<li>What's nearby?</li>
<li>What might be useful
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to my future self</li>
<li>to others</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Looking forward - I want to&#x2026;
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>draw more. It's fun.</li>
<li>deepen my reflections.</li>
<li>learn more.</li>
<li>prepare so I can keep doing this.</li>
</ul>

<p>
How can I improve workflows for capturing/thinking/sharing/finding?
</p>

<p>
What can I do so I can keep learning and writing all my life? How can I get even better at it?
</p>

From <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/10/how-to-take-smart-notes-sonke-ahrens-2017/">How to Take Smart Notes</a> (Sönke Ahrens):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you want to learn something for the long run,
you have to write it down. If you want to really
understand something, you have to translate it
into your own words.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Writing and sharing are part of how I learn.
Taking notes helps me learn things that are bigger
than my working memory or my uninterrupted time
segments. Sharing my notes helps me find them
again later on, since I can search the Internet
from my phone. Also, if I share my notes,
sometimes I get to learn from other people too,
and sometimes my notes help people figure out
stuff and then they can build on that.
</p>

<p>
It makes sense to me to share these notes on a
blog on my own domain, with a chronological view
and an RSS feed that makes it easier for other
people to check for updates if they want. Well,
some other people. I suppose RSS readers are still
a fairly technical sort of thing, and I don't
particularly like posting on platforms like
Facebook or LinkedIn. Anyway, I'll just keep
writing here, and maybe people will come across
posts via search engines or figure out how to get
updates however they want to.

I don't see myself giving up these tools until I
really can't use them any more. I'm keeping an eye
out for assistive technology that might help me
work around my limitations and the likely
cognitive/physical decline I'll eventually run
into. I'm encouraged by the fact that quite a few
people manage to keep learning and writing even
into their <a href="http://nocache.azcentral.com/thingstodo/arts/articles/20121125authors-work-old-career-roth-wolfe-leonard.html">80s and 90s</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some weeks, <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/category/emacs-news">Emacs News</a> is all I can squeeze in: a
long categorized list of links. When I have more
time, I add little bits of code, drawings,
reflections.
</p>

<p>
I love writing about little tweaks. Mostly that's
about Emacs. I love the way I can shape it into
something that fits <i>me</i>.
</p>

<p>
I like to <a href="https://sachachua.com/topic/visual-book-notes/">summarize books</a> and ideas as sketchnotes
so that I have a chance of remembering what I want
to learn from them. Also, the drawings are handy
for sharing with others, and they're a way of
giving back.
</p>

<p>
I'm slowly learning to write about life in a way
that helps me learn more while respecting people's
privacy. I like doing little experiments. Even
tinier than the ones described in <a href="https://nesslabs.com/book">Tiny
Experiments</a>. Not "I will write 100 blog posts over
the next 100 days," but rather, "What if I
postpone fretting about A+'s homework until
Saturday? What happens then?"

<p>
After I get the kiddo through the morning routine
and ready for virtual school, I usually play piano
for about an hour or so. Then it's recess and some
more hugs, and then I settle down for some writing
or drawing. The weather is getting better, so I'm
looking forward to moving some of that outside.
Maybe I'll dust off those baby monitor apps so I
can hear if A+ needs any help.
</p>

<p>
I mostly write on my laptop using <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> in
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">Emacs</a>. Org Mode is great for <a href="https://www.offerzen.com/blog/literate-programming-empower-your-writing-with-emacs-org-mode">literate programming</a>.
I can mix my notes and my code however I like.
</p>

<p>
I don't write in a straightforward way. I jump
around. I go on tangents and down rabbit-holes. It
helps a little if I've sketched my thoughts
beforehand, like for this post, or if I've done
some <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2023/12/audio-braindump-workflow-tweaks-adding-org-mode-hyperlinks-to-recordings-based-on-keywords/">audio braindumping</a> to help me figure out
where the interesting thoughts are. Sometimes I
capture little thoughts on my phone and then move
them to the post I'm working on. I'm trying to
figure out how to <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/03/playing-with-chunk-size-when-writing/">chunk my thoughts better</a>.
</p>

<p>
I have a lot of Emacs tweaks to make it easier to
link to <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#linking-to-blog-posts">blog posts</a>, <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#org-bookmarks">bookmarks</a>, <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#org-mode-sketch-links">sketches</a>, <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/10/yay-emacs-inserting-links-with-consult-omni/">sites
from search results</a>. I like
<a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#org-mode-writing-about-sketches-and-including-their-text">including the text of sketches</a>, too.
</p>

<p>
I use the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> static site generator to make my
blog. I switched to it a few years ago because I
didn't want to worry about keeping Wordpress
secure. I don't have room for many programming
languages in my brain at the moment, so I like the
fact that 11ty uses JavaScript. It takes me about
five minutes to compile my blog.

From <a href="https://dancullum.com/2025/03/the-more-i-read/">Dan Cullum: The more I read</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There is a strong correlation between the amount I’m reading, and the ideas I have for this blog.
When I’m reading a lot, I feel like I have ideas coming out my eyes.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Reading makes me want to write, too.
</p>

<p>
I love the <a href="https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/">Toronto Public Library</a> enough to
transplant myself from the tropics and learn how
to deal with winter. I've been reading more
e-books lately. It's easier to highlight e-books
compared to paper books. I can pick them up and
put them down easily, and keep the pages open when
I'm taking notes. I don't have to worry about
misplacing them, either. I have some code to <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/11/org-mode-format-libby-book-highlights-exported-as-json/">grab
my highlights as a JSON</a>, and then I can do things
with them: include them in blog posts, add them to
my personal notes, etc.
</p>

<p>
Not everything is available as an e-book, though,
and sometimes the e-books have long hold times.
Paper books are still handy enough.
</p>

<p>
I like reading blogs. They're much shorter than
books are, and much less fluffy. Sometimes I feel
like mainstream printed books have a lot of
padding because of the considerations of the
publishing industry: the book must be a certain
size so it doesn't get lost on the bookstore
shelf; the book must have a certain weight and
thickness so people feel that it's worth $25. Blog
posts can just get to the core of the idea instead
of belabouring the point. I like the fractal
<a href="https://kottke.org/24/11/the-powerful-density-of-hypertextual-writing">density of hyperlinked text</a>, too, and the
conversational possibilities of it. It's a lot
easier to bounce an idea back and forth to develop
it when you can post in a day instead of waiting
for a year for a book to be published.
</p>

<p>
I like reading on the new iPad. It's smaller than
my laptop and bigger than my phone. It's easy to
browse through blogs on it, unlike on my
Supernote. I'm starting to develop a workflow for
reading and writing smaller snippets: <a href="https://social.sachachua.com/@sacha/statuses/01JPH0VHDQ9V9KB5TD36QGGWVQ">(toot)</a>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Read in NetNewsWire.</li>
<li>Open interesting posts in Chrome on the iPad.</li>
<li>Highlight the text.</li>
<li>Use "Copy Link with Highlight".</li>
<li>Tap on the selection again. Use "Share" to send
it to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884">Ice Cubes</a>, a Mastodon client that can
post to my GoToSocial instance and let me use
my full post limit (5,000 characters,
mwahahahaha).</li>
<li>Paste the link into the toot, add my own thoughts, and post it.</li>
</ol>

webpage on my Android phone does this
automatically. "Copy Highlight as Link" works from
Chrome on the iPad. It saves people that little
bit of scrolling or finding, although I suppose it
would be helpful for people to go through the
context before that selection. Alternatively, I
could share directly from NetNewsWire and just
link to the blog post instead of the text.
</p>

<p>
I like making <a href="https://sachachua.com/topic/visual-book-notes">visual book notes</a>. They help me <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2013/04/how-i-read-books-and-do-visual-book-reviews/">read
a book well</a>, and turning the sketch into a blog
post gives me more opportunities to revisit it:
when I write the post, and if someone comments or
shares it.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I want to dust off my code for
<a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#mastodon-insert-statuses">collecting Mastodon posts into a blog post</a>, and
maybe also re-establish a weekly review process.

9, you don't have to fret about my jacket"), I'll
have more time for myself. This is a good time to
go bike and walk and explore outside, and to go
deep and wide into our interests as a family. I do
about 2-4 hours of consulting a week, just the
stuff I'm interested in. (<mark>TODO:</mark> There's a
tangent I want to write about <a href="https://medcircle.com/articles/adhd-interest-based-nervous-system/">interest-based
nervous systems</a>, which I notice in both A+ and
myself, and probably building on <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2014/03/reflecting-goals-time/">this 2014
reflection on having a buffet of goals</a>.) The rest
is life time, divided among the things we want to
learn/do/share and the things we do to take care
of ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Even though I have increasing autonomy when it
comes to time, and an increasing amount of focused
time, I still haven't gotten to the bottom of my
idea list or my to-write list. I don't think I'll
ever get to the bottom of those lists, actually. I
come up with ideas faster than I can do them.
That's a good problem to have.
</p>

<p>
It makes sense to prepare for a couple of changes
that will likely come up:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyopia">Age-related farsightedness</a>: It'll
probably get harder to read small text, and I
might eventually need to juggle my regular
glasses as well as reading glasses. (W- already
does this occasionally. He prefers having
different pairs of glasses instead of bifocals
or progressives, and his reasons seem sound. I
don't want to have to adopt different postures
to see out of different zones of glasses.)
Developing good workflows for reading will
probably help here. Also, the cargo vests I wear
will probably help me with the "Where are my
glasses?" problem.</li>

<li>Menopause will probably rewire my brain a lot. I
hear <a href="https://axiawh.com/resources/menopause-and-brain-fog/">brain fog and tip-of-the-tongue</a> can be
challenging (see also <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13697137.2022.2122792#d1e233">Brain fog in menopause</a>).</li>

<li>My mom is 79 and running into issues with
cognitive and physical decline. She has a hard
time typing, speaking, remembering, deciding, or
feeling good. On the other hand, there are
examples of people who have stayed sharp for
decades. There are lots of factors that are
beyond my control. Still, it would be nice to
see if I can stack the deck a little. So yes to:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>walks, bike rides, exercise, and maybe I can
figure out a fun way to improve strength;</li>
<li>lots of learning and sharing and connecting</li>
<li>and experiments with technological and
cognitive aids, like speech recognition to
work around typing, <a href="https://github.com/tvraman/emacspeak">text-to-speech interfaces</a>
to work around vision, notes to work around
working memory, and maybe large language
models to work around issues with recall.</li>
<li>&#x2026; and I might as well learn Morse code or
explore accessibility tools, just in case I'm
limited to <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/dictionary/famous-scientists/physicists/stephen-hawking5.htm">twitching cheek muscles</a> or
something like that.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The life expectancy at birth for the Philippines
for <a href="https://countryeconomy.com/demography/life-expectancy/philippines">women born in 1983</a> is ~65 years; <a href="https://countryeconomy.com/demography/life-expectancy/canada">in Canada</a>,
about ~80 years. I want to keep learning and
writing and sharing for as many of those years as
I can.
