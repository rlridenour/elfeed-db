<p>Bill Gates, commemorating Microsoft’s 50th anniversary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The story of how Microsoft came to be begins with, of
all things, a magazine. The January 1975 issue of
Popular Electronics featured an Altair 8800 on the
cover. The Altair 8800, created by a small electronics
company called MITS, was a groundbreaking personal
computer kit that promised to bring computing power to
hobbyists. When Paul and I saw that cover, we knew two
things: the PC revolution was imminent, and we wanted
to get in on the ground floor.</p>

<p>At the time, personal computers were practically non-existent.
Paul and I knew that creating software that let people program the
Altair could revolutionize the way people interacted with these
machines. So, we reached out to Ed Roberts, the founder of MITS,
and told him we had a version of the programming language BASIC
for the chip that the Altair 8800 ran on.</p>

<p>There was just one problem: We didn’t.<br/>
It was time to get to work.</p>

<p>At the bottom Gates links to a printout of the original source code for the BASIC interpreter, in extensively commented assembly language. Amongst all of his other accomplishments, Bill Gates was one hell of a programmer.</p>
