<p>Venezuela said on Monday it had closed its embassy in Oslo as part of a restructuring of its foreign service, a move Norway called &quot;regrettable&quot; [newarab.com#2][bbc.com#9]. Caracas also shut its embassy in Australia and is opening diplomatic outposts in Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, which it described as strategic partners against &quot;hegemonic pressures&quot; [straitstimes.com#1][newarab.com#2][scmp.com#8]. The decision comes days after Venezuelan opposition figure María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, though the Venezuelan government has framed the closures as a strategic reassignment and denied any link to the prize [aljazeera.com#4][bbc.com#9][mercopress.com#6].
