&#36;169 is the second lowest price that we've seen for the AirPods Pro 2 this year, so it's a good time to pick them up if you're in need of new noise cancelling earbuds.<br/>

Rumors suggest that Apple will release the AirPods Pro 3 this year, but they won't be available at a price as low as &#36;169. Amazon's deals sometimes sell out quick, so we recommend picking up the AirPods soon if you're interested. <br/>
