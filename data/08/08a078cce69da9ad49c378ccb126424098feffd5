<em>The Information</em>'s Kaya Yurieff and Kalley Huang in April reported that Meta was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/instagram-ipad-app/">working on a long-awaited Instagram app for iPads</a>.<br/>

<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman corroborated the report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-01/apple-s-wwdc-2025-plan-macos-tahoe-apple-intelligence-ai-ios-26-games-app-mbdlzqpz">in his <em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said that Meta employees are "actively testing" Instagram for the iPad, and he expects the app to be released this year, barring any setbacks.<br/>

Meta has offered a Facebook app for iPads since 2011, but it had largely avoided offering apps for the device otherwise. That tune finally seems to be changing, as the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/whatsapp-for-ipad-now-available/">released a WhatsApp app for iPads</a> last week, and there are now multiple sources who have claimed that an Instagram app for iPads is in the pipeline too.<br/>
<br/>
There is no word yet on whether Meta plans to release an iPad app for Threads as well.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/01/instagram-app-for-ipads-later-this-year/">Instagram Expected to Release iPad App Later This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-expected-to-release-ipad-app-later-this-year.2458024/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
