<i>Expression + Understanding = Communication</i>
</p>

<p>
A great discussion of <i>style</i>, perhaps the most elusive programming
skill. Illustrated across all the levels of abstraction that one
finds in Lisp: of data, functions, control, and syntax (the last
being essentially unique to Lisp macros). The discussion of
control abstraction deals extensively with catch/throw and other
primitives in the condition system that are dealt with at greater
length in <a href="/2024/03/06/the-common-lisp-condition-system/">The Common Lisp condition system</a>.
</p>

<p>
The extended example (starting on page 71) of how to simplify
logical expressions is amazingly clear, and really shows the
progression from simple functions to embedded languages targeting
specific tasks and making them easy to describe and extend to new
applications: something that lies at the heart of the Lisp
experience.

<p>
Much of the advice is actually language-agnostic, even though the
concrete examples are in Lisp. Norvig, of course, is the author of
<a href="/2024/03/07/paradigms-of-artificial-intelligence-programming-case-studies-in-common-lisp/">Paradigms of artificial intelligence programming</a>, and has made
enormous contributions to the theory and practice of Lisp.
