<p>Ben Thompson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To that end, while I understand why many people were underwhelmed by this WWDC, particularly in comparison to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/google-i-o-the-search-funnel-product-possibilities/">the AI extravaganza that was Google I/O</a>, I think it was one of the more encouraging Apple keynotes in a long time. Apple is a company that went too far in too many areas, and needed to retreat. Focusing on things only Apple can do is a good thing; empowering developers and depending on partners is a good thing; giving even the appearance of thoughtful thinking with regards to the App Store (it’s a low bar!) is a good thing. Of course we want and are excited by tech companies promising the future; what is a prerequisite is delivering in the present, and it’s a sign of progress that Apple retreated to nothing more than that.</p>
