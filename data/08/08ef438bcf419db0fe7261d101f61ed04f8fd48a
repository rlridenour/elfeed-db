In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-01/apple-s-wwdc-2025-plan-macos-tahoe-apple-intelligence-ai-ios-26-games-app-mbdlzqpz"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-01/apple-s-wwdc-2025-plan-macos-tahoe-apple-intelligence-ai-ios-26-games-app-mbdlzqpz"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said</a> that macOS 26 will be named macOS Tahoe, after California's scenic Lake Tahoe.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously named its Mac operating systems after big cats like Cheetah, Tiger, Leopard, and Lion. Starting with OS X Mavericks in 2013, however, Apple switched to California-themed names like Yosemite, Monterey, Sonoma, and Sequoia.<br/>
<br/>
Lake Tahoe is known for its reflective waters, which mirror the surrounding landscape, including mountains and the sky. Gurman said that would align with macOS 26's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">rumored glass-like design</a> with more translucent windows, buttons, and icons.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to unveil macOS 26 alongside iOS 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26 during its WWDC 2025 keynote, which is set to begin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/apple-announces-wwdc-2025-schedule/">on Monday, June 9 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time</a>.
