<p>New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said in an NBC interview that he stands by earlier descriptions of President Trump as a &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;despot,&quot; even after a notably cordial White House meeting between the two last week. Mamdani explained that he and the President discussed major cost-of-living pressures in New York, including housing, child care, groceries and utilities, and that he appreciated being able to address both their disagreements and shared priorities directly. At the White House, President Trump, who had previously suggested Mamdani should be deported, publicly congratulated him on his historic election and said he could do a &quot;great job&quot; leading the city. Despite his continued view that Trump poses a threat to democracy, Mamdani said he is prepared to work with the administration on issues affecting New Yorkers, separating his political critique from his governing responsibilities.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/kI5ZmamnAFJ-fHEYloU-SbyUiwAYMuaeSTn33yUtKpGvhVb0hruDm-Cnjx_5yh6s9dBbkZpLsKh6xvTVgeHk8Z0J5cdphvwu_xf1LF4Yk4ZNELenN42Jl-ziiOdnRpEfSCa1PBuTSrvZS3TFySWx2PlNlnFt5dkHtPE8Hi2ES4r7qXHzUPimhuYPVDg3XwFFWhSreuIUotgxYGwBdTyzdciHOKcuFYw22Z3KfXTLNNOXG9TUhwWXYx_IBgGkS65LOyeHcRCHb2Rk5nBldTGA' alt='New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani speaks to the media after his recent White House meeting with President Trump.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Meeting focus: Mamdani said his conversation with President Trump repeatedly returned to his campaign themes about making everyday expenses in New York more affordable, including shelter, child care and basic household costs.</li><li>Trump’s earlier stance: Before the White House visit, President Trump had threatened to cut federal funds to New York City and deployed the National Guard there, while also suggesting Mamdani should be deported.</li><li>Tone at White House: During their joint appearance with reporters, Trump lightened the mood when asked about Mamdani’s past criticism, telling the mayor-elect he could simply repeat it and adding that he personally did not mind.</li><li>Public reassurance: In his NBC interview, Mamdani framed the meeting as “productive” and emphasized that frank talk about political differences did not prevent them from discussing practical solutions for residents.</li><li>Media framing: Coverage of the episode has highlighted the contrast between Trump’s previous attacks on Mamdani and his recent praise, with outlets describing the encounter as a surprising or friendly turn in their relationship.</li></ul><blockquote>I think it is important in our politics that we don’t shy away from where we have disagreements. - Zohran Mamdani</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Zohran Mamdani: Mamdani said that “everything that I’ve said in the past I continue to believe” about Trump while also calling his White House conversation with the President “productive” and focused on living costs in New York.
