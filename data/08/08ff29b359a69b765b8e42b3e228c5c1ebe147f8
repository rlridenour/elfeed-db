For the past year I&rsquo;ve been using the free version of Mighty SMS (phone app | tablet app –sorry; Android only) to text message from my computer, actually using my phone and its phone number. The app is slick and light-weight: it does one thing and does it well. I now almost never text from my touch-screen, but get the full speed of my keyboard by logging into the web app in my browser (which I keep pinned).
