<li>Duffel bags, 3 to choose from (or a sling bag)</li>
<li>They’re good, running from $60 to $150 on Hex’s website</li>
<li>The Halo bags <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/iq39fh/hex_reveals_new_halo_bags_for_halo_infinite/">were a collaboration for the release of Halo Infinite</a>, hence the UNSC (United Nations Space Command) and ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence)</li>
<li>Understated but stylish</li>
<li>Are they available in Georgia Red: No, but if you were an actual bulldog, you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between these gray bags and red ones</li>
</ul><h1>So Many Duffin' Options</h1><p>For about a decade, I used the backpack they gave me when I started my job at the old deal-a-day site. When, eventually, one of my cats destroyed it, I took the one my wife got at <em>her</em> job, before eventually buying a more stylish, highly-discounted one right here on Meh.</p>
<p>As for the duffels I’ve used over the years, I don’t even know where they came from. We just had some in the house when I was a kid, and eventually one became mine and remained that way until, eventually, it broke in my mid-20s. Since then, I’ve basically used either my wheeled luggage or a tote bag for all duffel-sized loads.</p>
<p>Which is all to say, I don’t buy bags very often.</p>
<p>So, you could imagine my surprise when I started reading about these duffels and found out that the <em>cheapest</em> one retails on the company’s website for about 60 bucks. And the biggest/fanciest one? That would run you $150.</p>
<p>How?! Does it come pre-filled with black truffles???</p>
<p>It’s like bag-makers are saying, “If it’s as simple as you think, why don’t you make one yourself, you friggin’ loser.”</p>
<p>Of course, I’m being dramatic. But the point stands: outside of maybe pillows, bags are the products whose prices most often amaze me. Or, I should clarify, <em>good</em> bags.</p>
<p>Sure, you can get cheap bags. Just like you can get cheap pillows. Just like you can get those sandals from a bin at the grocery store for, like, a dollar. But you know what? They’re gonna wear down and break. As will the pillows. As will the bags.</p>
<p>So, you <em>should</em> get a good bag.</p>
<p>But paying those good bag prices?</p>
<p>Yikes!</p>
<p>Hence why you should buy bags from us. Today, you can get a rad duffel, one that typically goes for $150, and you can get it for less than the cheapest one would cost directly from Hex.</p>
<p>So get a bag. For cheap. You’ll use it. It’s a bag, after all.</p>
