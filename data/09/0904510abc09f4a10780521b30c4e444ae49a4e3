Canadian cell phone plans have historically been very expensive compared to other countries, so we want to highlight a really good deal that has popped up.<br/>

In Canada, the carrier Public Mobile has launched a limited-time flash sale that offers 50% off its <a href="https://www.publicmobile.ca/en/plans">5G Canada — U.S. — Mexico plans</a> for a two-year period.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the discounted plans available to new customers through January 26, with each also including unlimited calling and text messaging:<ul><li><strong>60GB</strong> of 5G data for <strong>&#36;20 per month</strong> (regularly &#36;40 per month)</li><br/>
<li><strong>80GB</strong> of 5G data for <strong>&#36;25 per month</strong> (regularly &#36;50 per month)</li><br/>
<li><strong>100GB</strong> of 5G data for <strong>&#36;30 per month</strong> (regularly &#36;60 per month)</li></ul>Public Mobile says these discounted plans are available for new activations only, and the promotion will expire 24 months after it is applied. Existing customers were briefly able to switch to a 100GB plan for just &#36;20 per month (down from &#36;40 per month) in the Public Mobile app, but this is no longer possible as of writing.<br/>
<br/>
You can use your allotted data while roaming in the U.S. and Mexico at no additional cost, but note that Public Mobile limits 5G speeds to up to 250 Mbps. And after the allotted amount, data speeds are reduced to a maximum of just 512 Kbps.<br/>
<br/>
Public Mobile is a prepaid carrier, meaning that you pay upfront for your monthly plan, with no credit check required. You can cancel your subscription at any time.<br/>
<br/>
As a Telus subsidiary, Public Mobile uses the Telus network in Canada. However, Public Mobile customers may be deprioritized in busy areas if necessary, and cellular coverage can vary based on your location. All in all, service might not always be comparable to a major carrier like Bell or Rogers, but your mileage may vary.<br/>

<strong>Update:</strong> Existing customers were briefly able to switch to a 100GB plan for just &#36;20 per month (down from &#36;40 per month), but this is no longer possible. Still, the 60GB for &#36;20 per month offer for new customers is a great deal by Canadian standards.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/public-mobile-50-percent-off-plans/">Public Mobile Offering 60GB of 5G Data for &#36;20/Month in Canada</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/public-mobile-offering-60gb-of-5g-data-for-20-month-in-canada.2476542/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
