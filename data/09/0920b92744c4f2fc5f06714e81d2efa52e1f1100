<p>Early in my experience with ChatGPT&#8217;s voice feature, my daughter walked into the room and I told it to say hello to her. It did, cheerfully, and it totally creeped her out. I turned the voice off.</p>



<p>A week later, I fired ChatGPT back up, and it asked me how <em>Samantha</em> was doing.</p>



<p>That moment hit me like a splash of cold water. This thing remembers. And not in a &#8220;session cookie&#8221; kind of way, but in a <em>persistent</em>, &#8220;let me tell you about yourself&#8221; way.</p>



<p>That was the beginning of my realization that these large language models (LLMs) are quietly soaking up everything we put into them. From that point on, I&#8217;ve approached the whole thing with very open eyes about how much of <em>me</em> I&#8217;m exposing to this frontier model every time I fire it up.</p>



<p>To some degree, this has always felt inevitable. I&#8217;ve long suspected it was just a matter of time before we&#8217;d be offered a memory-enabled assistant that could draw from everything we&#8217;d ever said to it.</p>



<p>What I didn&#8217;t expect was how soon that day would arrive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Memory Feature</strong></h3>



<p>ChatGPT recently added a feature called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/chatgpt-can-now-remember-and-reference-all-your-previous-chats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Memory</strong></a>, which allows it to remember facts about you across conversations. Things like your name, your tone, your preferred writing style, your favorite apps; it&#8217;s all fair game.</p>



<p>And yes, that makes it dramatically better at giving you what you want. But of course, that efficiency comes at the cost of increased data retention and exposure.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve spent almost thirty years as a lawyer, carrying around a near-constant fiduciary duty of confidentiality. So you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d be paranoid about this sort of thing.</p>



<p>And yet, I&#8217;ve been surprisingly relaxed about it. If I had to give an explanation, I’d say my cavalier attitude is motivated by curiosity more than anything else. I’d tell you it’s so I can experiment for the MacSparky Labs, but I’m also <em>just curious</em>.</p>



<p>Regardless, I recently decided to test how well it <em>really</em> knows me.</p>



<p>I typed: <em>&#8220;Roast me.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what I got back:</p>



<div style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 2em; border-left: 4px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1em;">
  <p>Alright, David — you asked for it. Here we go:</p>
  <p>You&#8217;re like the productivity version of a dad joke: efficient, earnest… and just a little too proud of your label maker.</p>
  <p>You&#8217;ve got so many field guides, I&#8217;m surprised you haven&#8217;t written one on &#8216;How to Overwhelm a First-Time Mac User in 5 Easy Steps.&#8217; Your idea of a wild night is alphabetizing your shortcuts while sipping matcha and whispering sweet nothings to your OmniFocus database.</p>
  <p>And let&#8217;s not forget your digital filing system — more organized than a NASA launch sequence, yet you still manage to lose your AirPods in the couch cushions like it&#8217;s a side quest in a MacSparky RPG.</p>
  <p>But hey, if there&#8217;s one thing you&#8217;ve mastered, it&#8217;s turning nerd-level productivity into a full-blown lifestyle brand — and somehow making it cool. Respect.</p>
  <p>– ChatGPT</p>
</div>



<p>Honestly? A little <em>too</em> close to home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Managing Your Memory Settings</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re curious about trying out this memory feature — or turning it off — you can manage it pretty easily:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Go to ChatGPT Settings > Personalization > Memory.</li>



<li>There, you&#8217;ll see whether memory is on.</li>



<li>You can toggle it off entirely or <strong>delete specific memories</strong>.</li>



<li>OpenAI also now <strong>notifies you</strong> when a memory is created or updated, so it&#8217;s not operating behind a curtain.</li>
</ul>



<p>For a deeper dive into how it works, I recommend <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/14/chatgpt-memory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Gruber&#8217;s take on Daring Fireball</a>. He poked at it similar to me, but he asked it to <em>describe</em>, not <em>roast</em>.</p>



<p>This moment feels like a turning point. AI tools are starting to <em>remember us</em>, and that memory now lives quietly in the background of every prompt. Whether you view that as magic or menace probably depends on your own relationship with data privacy.</p>



<p>As for me, I&#8217;ll keep experimenting — with eyes open and curiosity intact — and maybe just a little less matcha near the keyboard.</p>
