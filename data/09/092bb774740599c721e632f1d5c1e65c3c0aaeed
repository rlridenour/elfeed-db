<p>In the latest development, Iranian authorities cut internet and international phone access as protests spread across multiple cities, with demonstrations fueled by anger over the economy and the falling rial. Rights groups and monitors reported a rising death toll and mass arrests as security forces moved to contain unrest, while Iranian state media warned of potential casualties and portrayed the violence as the work of outside-linked “agents”. Despite the communications shutdown, demonstrators continued marching and chanting into Friday, sharing videos when possible and organizing through strikes and nighttime neighborhood calls. The situation is drawing international attention, including warnings from President Trump about U.S. action if Iranian authorities kill protesters.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/z80QpyKTIr0cunCT57H8jqg3LH0AO8mjG-PMfnxYCP3v8lTtna--ZE498kc3lsZWoFHRTDY7u9AVQDSttrSlLYzALUZxdDTYzIHbAUXHON4B7e1O2XwCxjIYuKDnZ3ZxOAiCDbzrxh3yvl23JfXqwqmnNLhSOtaHtx82KUpiRwi7fJoE6KcQ4au5lNryCR9HRcigI-da1uI' alt='People blocked a street during a protest in Kermanshah, Iran, on Thursday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Protest origins: The current wave began with a Tehran Grand Bazaar shutdown on Dec. 28 after the rial hit record lows, then spread beyond Tehran into nationwide rallies.</li><li>Scale of unrest: A U.S.-based monitor, Human Rights Activists News Agency, reported more than 340 protests across all 31 provinces, indicating broad geographic participation.</li><li>Shifting tactics: As crackdowns intensified, protesters increasingly mixed street rallies with strikes and symbolic acts such as toppling statues, according to reporting and activist video tallies.</li><li>Government responses: President Masoud Pezeshkian publicly warned suppliers against hoarding or overpricing goods and said people should not feel shortages as officials pursued subsidy reforms amid unrest.</li><li>Competing narratives: Iranian state TV said fires and unrest involved “terrorist agents” tied to the U.S. and Israel, while protesters and opposition figures framed the demonstrations as a popular challenge to the clerical leadership.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iranian authorities and state media: Officials have signaled a harsh response to unrest and state TV has attributed violence and arson to outside-linked “terrorist agents,” while emphasizing warnings about casualties.
