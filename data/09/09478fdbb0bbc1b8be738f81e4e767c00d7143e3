The Weibo user known as "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Instant Digital</a>" today suggested that next-year's &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models will be available in at least one of the following color options: Coffee, purple, and burgundy.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> XR, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro were all available in lavender or purple, but there have never been coffee or burgundy iPhones before. A coffee-colored &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro could be a good successor to the gold &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS or the "desert titanium" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro. <br/>
<br/>
Coffee sits in the brown family as a deep and earthy shade. Burgundy belongs to the red family, blending rich crimson with traces of brown or purple for a darker, wine-like tone. Purple lies between red and blue, but when muted or darkened, it leans warm. <br/>
<br/>
The leaker added that there will still be no black &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro next year. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> is available in Silver, Deep Blue, and Cosmic Orange. There was no black or gray option for the first time in the device's history.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models are expected to launch in the fall of next year, featuring the A20 chip made with TSMC's 2nm process, a variable aperture main camera, the C2 modem, a simplified Camera Control, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/30/8-reasons-wait-next-year-iphone-18-pro/">more</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/31/leaker-outlines-colors-for-iphone-18-pro/">Leaker Outlines Potential New Colors for iPhone 18 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaker-outlines-potential-new-colors-for-iphone-18-pro.2470202/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
