<p>Last month I started exclusively using todo.txt and calendar.txt while away from my usual routine, as a tiny experiment. Now that regular life has resumed, I feel drawn to continue with them rather than returning to the tools they’ve replaced. <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/06/ptpl-176-simple-obsidian-iphone-shortcuts" title="wikilink">Here’s the back story</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-good-and-the-bad-of-the-beorg-apple-calendar-combo">The good and the bad of the Beorg / Apple Calendar combo</h3>
<p>[2025-07-21 <span class="small-caps">PTPL</span> 166 - Beorg May Well Be the Best Free iOS Plain Text Task Manager|Beorg]] and Apple Calendar are still a beautiful combination. They can handle repeating tasks and they work together well, or well enough. (<a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/07/21/ptpl-166-beorg-best-free-ios-plain-text-task-manager" title="wikilink">Read more</a>)</p>
<p>Despite that, there were some niggles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Entries could easily become <strong>complicated</strong> (properties, different ways to make a task appear on multiple dates)</li>
<li>The spectre of <strong>Org mode</strong> kept whispering how much more power I could have if I’d only embrace Emacs (so not ready for that)</li>
<li>I kept longing for the peace I had felt in the past with a <strong>simple list</strong> that let me manage tasks in any text editor</li>
</ul>
<p>During the experiment of tracking tasks and time with nothing but text, all the niggles evaporated!</p>
<p>And I think I know why.</p>
<p>Now that I’m fully involved in the process, there’s no need to stick with the plans made by the me of yesterday, though of course I can, and many times I do. But when the day rolls around, those past-made plans aren’t always relevant.</p>
<p>Hand crafting a Today list the night before feels like an important ritual, marking the transition from planning to doing. It gives me true ownership over my decisions. I can focus on the work without second-guessing what past-me thought I should be doing.</p>
<h3 id="time-sectors-are-what-make-it-work">Time Sectors are what make it work</h3>
<p>The key to bringing order to what looks like a chaotic to do list, are the time sectors I assign to every task.</p>
<p>The most important question to answer is, <strong>When do I plan to do this</strong>? It’s easier to answer than you might think.</p>
<p>Carl Pullein, who introduced me to the concept of time sectors, uses these as folders in Todoist:</p>
<ul>
<li>This week</li>
<li>Next week</li>
<li>This month</li>
<li>Next month</li>
<li>On hold / Longterm</li>
<li>Routines</li>
<li>Repeating Areas of Focus</li>
</ul>
<p>My time sectors aren’t folders, they’re contexts in the <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt" target="_blank">todo.txt syntax</a>. I’ve added three more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Today</strong> (<code>@td</code>)</li>
<li>This week (<code>@tw</code>)</li>
<li>Next week (<code>@nw</code>)</li>
<li>This month (<code>@tm</code>)</li>
<li>Next month (<code>@nm</code>)</li>
<li><strong>This year</strong> (<code>@ty</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Next year</strong> (<code>@ny</code>)</li>
<li>On hold (<code>@oh</code>)</li>
<li>Routines (<code>@rt</code>)</li>
<li>Repeating Areas of Focus (<code>@fs</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Today</em> is a curated set of tasks drawn from <em>This Week</em>.</p>
<p><em>This year</em> and <em>Next year</em> tell me which <em>On hold</em> tasks to look at next, and which can wait.</p>
<h3 id="an-example-task">An example task</h3>
<p>Now I’ll show you a task in three stages of its lifetime, to demonstrate how the time sector changes and the order I add supplementary notes.</p>
<p><code>2025-09-29 @tw Donate plasma +E / 2025-10-05 Allow 45 minutes</code></p>
<p>This is a task that was entered on September 29, that I plan to do sometime this week. It has one supplementary note, added on October 5th. The <code>+E</code> is my code for personal tasks; it’s one of the categories I use for time blocking in my calendar.</p>
<p>Next I change the time sector to show that it should be done today, and I add another supplementary note <em>before</em> the last note:</p>
<p><code>2025-09-29 @td Donate plasma +E / 2025-10-12 Bring a light rug, it gets cold there! / 2025-10-05 Allow 45 minutes</code></p>
<p>When the task is completed, I’ll add an <code>x</code> and the completion date:</p>
<p><code>x 2025-10-30 2025-09-29 @td Donate plasma +E / 2025-10-12 Bring a light rug, it gets cold there! / 2025-10-05 Allow 45 minutes</code></p>
<p>It’s not necessary to sort the tasks, but I like to do that (in <span class="small-caps">VS</span> Code) to reveal which ones have been hanging around for a while! Older tasks appear at the top of the search results, lending a subtle sense of order to what is essentially a feeder list for my <em>Today</em> tasks.</p>
<p>Sorting also sends all the completed tasks to the bottom of the file, where I can easily move them into their own dated archive at the end of each year.</p>
<h3 id="obsidian-makes-it-easier-and-more-fun">Obsidian makes it easier, and more fun</h3>
<p>While this task management system works in any text editor, my favourite is Obsidian. Here’s why.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmarks</strong> are saved searches that make it easier to review time sectors and projects. E.g. All tasks marked for this week, minus any completed this year: <code>file:todo-txt line:(@tw -"x 2025")</code>. I use Bookmarks for each time sector, and for the calendar categories. It’s quick to take a look at today’s tasks, or to pull up all the Work tasks for this month.</p>

<p>The <strong>Todo.txt mode plugin</strong> adds customisable syntax highlighting, when used with the Style Settings Plugin.</p>

<p>Another Obsidian feature I love is the Keyboard shortcut for moving lines up and down. I use this daily when preparing my Today list, and re-evaluating it throughout the day. On my Mac I have it mapped to <span class="small-caps">⌘1</span> and <span class="small-caps">⌘2</span>, and it’s on the Toolbar of my iPhone, see the red box in the image below.</p>

<p><a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/06/ptpl-176-simple-obsidian-iphone-shortcuts" title="wikilink">These four text files</a> are all I need but <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/09/22/ptpl-174-time-travel-wall-paper-digital-calendars" title="wikilink">analog tools</a> could do the job just as well, minus the convenience of copy-paste, sorting, and shifting lines up and down.</p>
<p>The manual nature of this system is a feature, not an inconvenience or a bug. It forces me, in the present moment, to check in with what past me planned and consciously agree, or not.</p>
<p>That’s hugely important for my psyche!</p>
<p>It’s solved the trust issues I always had with more automated task management systems; both the relevance of tasks planned days or weeks ago, and the future-proofing and portability of my data.</p>
