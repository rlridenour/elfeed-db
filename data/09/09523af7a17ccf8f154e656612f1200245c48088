<li>Little fans with soft blades</li>
<li>They do need to be plugged in</li>
<li>Perfect for your office or bedside table</li>
<li>Are they Mac-compatible: Oh yeah, they’ll cool off your sweaty Mac no problem</li>
</ul><h1>Breeze Supply</h1><p>Today, as I sit here writing this, my weather app tells me the high will be in the mid-80s. No, <a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/stuff-you-should-buy-before-it-s-95">not yet 95</a>, but not exactly cool either.</p>
<p>Now, there’s no shame in turning on the AC when it’s 85. The problem is, a high of 85 is not an 85-degree day. It’s day in the 70s from sun-up until about noon and then again from sundown into the night.</p>
<p>And yet, the thermometer doesn’t always correspond perfectly to how the day <em>feels</em>. Humidity, sun, stagnant air–it can all add up to misery even if the temperature inside is “just right.” Especially if you’re up and on your feet doing something like <a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/cook-like-no-one-s-watching-they-re-not">cooking</a>.</p>
<p>For this reason, you need some cooling solutions for those days when it doesn’t feel right to run your AC. Like, say, some little fans.</p>
<p>These. The ones we’re selling right here.</p>
<p>Here’s a pretty handy sales pitch <a href="/@neopifex">@neopifex</a> posted on a previous sale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve probably owned seven or eight Zippis over the years. They’re great for using at your desk or by your bedside, or even next to your preferred spot in front of the TV. This is because the fan is quiet. Like, you’ll forget to turn it off half the time, it’s so quiet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perfect for moving a little air when you’re getting some work done, <a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/gadgets-you-ll-pretend-improve-your-life">fooling around with a fun new gadget</a>, or doing something totally <a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/this-stuff-had-nowhere-else-to-go">random</a>. Nice, right?</p>
<p>But that last bit is really the key: the noise.</p>
<p>Nothing’s worse than when you’re sitting on the couch, <a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/you-re-not-hungry-you-re-just-bored">noshing on some snacks</a>, and you have decide whether you want to sweat and hear the movie or not sweat and understand about 65% of what’s happening on the screen because the sound mixing on some streaming services is so off.</p>
<p>It’s <a href="https://meh.com/deals/instant-regret-kit-76">irksome</a>, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Anyway, get some fans before they <a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/it-s-basically-sold-out-but-go-ahead">sell out</a>!</p>
<p>(Also, if you haven’t caught on, we’re trying to get you over to <a href="http://sidedeal.com/">SideDeal</a> to shop the SideDeal-o-Rama, still going for one more day, where every dollar you spend equals 50 cents off your IRK, up to $30.
