<p>I&rsquo;m visiting my mom, who lives with her boyfriend of several years. As a New Yorker, this place is huge - a garage for two cars, two showers and a half, a dining room separate from a kitchen and a foyer, and more space that I don&rsquo;t know how to name correctly. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a big house, not a <em>huge</em> house, somewhere in Pennsylvania where you can afford something like this on a mortgage without robbing a bank, I guess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in NYC for over a decade, and I&rsquo;m used to small spaces. My new bedroom is huge compared to anywhere else I&rsquo;ve lived before, but the apartment itself is small, but not in a contrasting way, it&rsquo;s comfy. I don&rsquo;t understand why people need all this space.</p>
<p>Most people my age (40s) have a family and kids, so a few more bedrooms make sense, two bathrooms and showers, sure, but let&rsquo;s say you only have one kid, or maybe the kid moved out, or maybe you just don&rsquo;t have kids. I think (and I may be wrong?) most people live in houses, and these houses have space, and, well, what do you do with this space?</p>
<p>Over here, they love plants:  📷</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s the art they like to get, and the basement has a lot of tools and additional storage, and then there&rsquo;s another old fridge in the garage, and the dining room has a table, but you can also eat in the kitchen - but why? I feel like I&rsquo;m criticizing and not coming from the angle of &ldquo;this is wrong,&rdquo; I just don&rsquo;t get it. Maybe if I were to live in a place like this for a while, I would. What do you get out of the extra space and extra stuff?</p>
