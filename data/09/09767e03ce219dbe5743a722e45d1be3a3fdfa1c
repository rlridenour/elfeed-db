<p>What percentage of the authors in elite philosophy journals are women?<span id="more-53654"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the question <a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Schwitzgebel</a> (UC Riverside) takes up in the following guest post.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Author Gender in Elite Philosophy Journals<br />
by Eric Schwitzgebel</h2>
<p>In some ways, the gender situation has been improving in philosophy. Women <a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2023/09/percentage-of-women-philosophy-majors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now constitute about 40%</a> of graduating majors in philosophy in the U.S., up from about 32% in the 1980s-2010s. There is, I think, substantially more awareness of gender issues and the desirability of gender diversity than there was fifteen years ago. And yet, <a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DiversityUS.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the highest levels of impact and prestige</a>, philosophy remains <a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-gender-and-raceethnicity-of-authors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelmingly male</a>.</p>
<p>One measure of this is authorship in elite philosophy journals. For this post, I examined the past two years&#8217; tables of contents of <i>Philosophical Review, Mind, Journal of Philosophy,</i> and <i>Noûs</i>&#8212;widely considered to be the most elite general philosophy journals in mainstream Anglophone philosophy. (<a href="https://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2022/07/best-general-philosophy-journals-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some rankings</a> put <i>Philosophy &amp; Phenomenological Research</i> alongside these four.) I estimated the gender of each author of each article, commentary, or response (excluding book reviews and editorial prefaces), based on gender-typical name, gender-typical photo, pronoun use, and/or personal knowledge, generally using at least two criteria. Of 291 included authors, there were only two who were either non-binary or defied classification&#8212;in both cases, based on an expressed preference for they/them pronouns. There&#8217;s always a risk of mistake, but for the most part I expect that my gender classifications accurately reflect how the authors identify and are perceived, with at most a 1-2% error rate.</p>
<p>Overall, I found:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Authorship Rates In Four Elite Philosophy Journals (Past Two Years):<br />
</b>Women: 46 authorships<br />
Men: 243 authorships<br />
Nonbinary/unclassified: 2 authorships<br />
<b>Percent women: 16%</b></p>
<p>Women now earn <a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2023/11/percent-of-us-philosophy-phd-recipients.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 30% of PhDs</a> in the United States and constitute <a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/data_on_profession/fy2024_demographic_statistic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost 30% of American Philosophical Association members</a> who report their gender, so authorship in these journals is substantially more gender-skewed than faculty in the US. Of course, many authors are neither located nor received their PhD in the US, so these percentages aren&#8217;t strictly comparable. However, PhD and faculty percentages are <a href="https://bpa.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-BPA-SWIP-Report-Women-in-Philosophy-in-the-UK.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broadly similar in the United Kingdom</a> and, impressionistically, in other high-income Anglophone countries. (I&#8217;m less sure outside the English-speaking world, but researchers in non-Anglophone countries author only a small percentage of articles in elite Anglophone journals; see here for an analysis of the <a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Anglophone.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insularity of Anglophone philosophy</a>.)</p>
<p>Now, one possible explanation of this skew is that women are more likely to specialize in ethics than in other areas of philosophy (see these <a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/11/percentage-of-women-at-apa-meetings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ten-year-old data</a>), and these four journals publish relatively little ethics. To explore this possibility, I did two things:</p>
<p>First, I coded each article in the big four journals as either &#8220;ethics&#8221; or &#8220;non-ethics&#8221;, based on the title or the abstract (if the title was ambiguous). I included political philosophy, social philosophy, metaethics, and history of ethics as ethics. (Of course, there were some gray-area cases and judgment calls.)</p>
<p>Second, I added two journals to my list: <i>Ethics</i> and <i>Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs</i>, generally considered the two most elite ethics journals (though after the <a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/05/22/editors-at-philosophy-will-launch-new-oa-journal/">editorial turmoil</a> at PPA last year, it&#8217;s not clear whether this will remain true of PPA).</p>
<p>In the big four, I classified 60/291 (21%) authorships as ethics. (Perhaps this is a slight underrepresentation of ethics in these journals, relative to the proportion of research faculty in the Anglophone world who specialize in ethics?) In these journals, I found that indeed women have a higher percentage of ethics authorships than non-ethics authorships:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Authorship by Gender in Big 4 Philosophy Journals Ethics vs. Non-Ethics<br />
</b>Ethics: 17/60 (28% women)<br />
Non-ethics: 29/231 (13% women)<br />
[Fisher&#8217;s exact 2-tail, p = .005]
<p>If we juice up the sample size by adding in <i>Ethics</i> and <i>PPA</i>, we get the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Authorship by Gender in 6 Elite Philosophy Journals Ethics vs. Non-Ethics<br />
</b>Ethics: 40/142 (29% women)<br />
Non-ethics: 29/231 (13% women)<br />
[Fisher&#8217;s exact 2-tail, p &lt; .001]
<p>Strikingly, women appear to be more than twice as likely to author ethics articles than non-ethics articles.</p>
<p><a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/12/only-13-of-authors-in-five-leading.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ten years ago, I did some similar analyses,</a> comparing ethics vs. non-ethics authorships in two-year bins every 20 years from 1955 to 2015. In those samples, too, I found women to author only a small percentage of articles in elite journals overall (13% in 2014-2015) and to be more likely to author in ethics, so the trends are historically consistent.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE </strong>(4/29/25): Some readers have taken issue with Schwitzgebel&#8217;s identification of &#8220;the most elite&#8221; philosophy journals. There are some who object that this kind of fine-grained ranking of philosophy journals is absurd. There are others who think Schwitzgebel is not using the proper ranking, and who reminded me of <a href="https://dailynous.com/2023/12/04/new-meta-ranking-of-philosophy-journals/">this post about a meta-ranking of philosophy journals</a>, according to which the top four in the meta-ranking are <em>Noûs, Philosophical Studies</em>, <em>Philosophy &amp; Phenomenological Research</em>, and <em>Synthese </em>and the top four according to a survey conducted by the creator of the meta-ranking, Boudewijn de Bruin (Groningen), are <em>Noûs</em>, <em>Philosophy &amp; Phenomenological Research</em>, <em>Mind</em>, and <em>Philosophical Review</em>. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-023-04342-9/tables/5">This table</a>, from de Bruin&#8217;s article about the meta-rankings, shows how generalist journals rank in terms of a few areas of specialization, including ethics, and so may be of particular interest when assessing issues at the intersection of subject matter and author gender.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/28/author-gender-in-elite-philosophy-journals-guest-post/">Author Gender in Elite Philosophy Journals (guest post) (updated)</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
