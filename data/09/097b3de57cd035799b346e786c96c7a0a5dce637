<p>Nigerian President Bola Tinubu announced that all 24 schoolgirls who had remained in captivity after being abducted from Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga, Kebbi State, have been rescued alive more than a week after their kidnapping by armed attackers. Authorities initially reported that 25 students were seized during the 17 November night-time raid, but one girl escaped shortly after the attack, leaving 24 still missing until their release was confirmed on Tuesday. Officials have not disclosed details of how or where the rescue took place, but Tinubu praised the security forces’ role and said he felt relief that the girls were accounted for. The president also ordered security agencies to intensify operations in other states where recent school kidnappings have left hundreds of children still missing, underlining that the Kebbi rescue is one positive outcome in a wider struggle against mass abductions in northern Nigeria.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/2DlMbo9XwAH8mASfKnRxRb4ZE3P4f0LMwGeAVsEjTc1JH8ub51iR5vCp63BX2TrlIIXlfq2ua5AK6rzOls5HZly0rNynsL75OaLNdU1GE5NXWxzvZXT6jIbyeh-w2nYJlqjTiL02RdwQ92rT25L0LNBb-L_k7vy2DkI5HY0tFeY1nPdICCzrofDzMn9dya-2yBFtINwFVGL4HXaiX4iM71DswhegizsTOBSeY9G8pdDlogctOhosaDehvEzs0t11WbLcGNngHKcW' alt='Security personnel and residents gather outside Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga, Kebbi State, after the abduction of students.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Attack details: During the 17 November raid on the boarding school in Maga, gunmen killed two staff members while abducting the students, according to Nigerian police reports cited by local and international media.</li><li>Presidential response: Tinubu cancelled a planned trip to the recent G20 Summit in South Africa to focus on the surge in kidnappings and has now ordered more troops to be deployed to vulnerable areas following the Kebbi abduction and similar incidents in Kwara and Niger States.</li><li>Copycat incidents: Presidential advisers said the Kebbi school attack was followed by other school kidnappings in Eruku in Kwara State and Papiri in Niger State, where armed men recently seized more than 300 pupils and 12 teachers from St. Mary’s Catholic School.</li><li>Escaped student: The school principal in Kebbi reported that one abducted girl managed to flee the kidnappers on the same day as the attack, which led authorities to revise the number of students in captivity from 25 to 24.</li><li>Ongoing crisis: Despite the Kebbi girls’ rescue, hundreds of children taken in other recent mass abductions across Nigeria remain unaccounted for, underscoring the scale of the country’s kidnapping-for-ransom problem.</li></ul><blockquote>Nigeria’s future depends on the education of our children and the Kebbi girls will be helped to overcome the trauma and distress of this harrowing experience. - President Bola Tinubu</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Bola Tinubu: He welcomed the rescue as a relief for the nation and linked it to a broader push to secure schools and rescue other kidnapped children across several northern states.
