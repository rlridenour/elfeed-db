<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Here I draw two entries from my #journal; annotating some thoughts as well as how I&rsquo;ve expanded my #writing process over the last two months.  There&rsquo;s a #poem in here as well.
</p>
        <p>On <time datetime="2024-11-12" title="2024-11-12">Tuesday the 12th of November, 2024</time>, I started what I hoped to be a new habit.
That is writing a personal daily journal.  Over the weeks, I expanded my
aspirations to include a daily check list of activities I wanted to do.</p>
<p>I’ve also used these journals to spin-off blog posts; such as this one.  In
other words, my daily journal is growing a virtuous cycle in my creative
process.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-got-going">How It Got Going</h2>
<p>These are the notes for <time datetime="2024-11-19" title="2024-11-19">November 19th</time>, one week after starting my electronic
journal endeavor.</p>

<aside  role="note" class="margin">

<p><small>This used to be a bulleted list, but I went back and converted lists to terse
paragraphs.  As future entries attest, going from list to paragraph was a good
move; I’m spending just a bit more time synthesizing the “list” item.</small></p>

<p>Finished reading bell hooks <cite data-id="8EC50DA2-394A-4002-BA2D-C4B47C15D725">all about love</cite> by bell hooks.</p>
<p>I was able to get quite a bit of work done; and have some tasks lined up for
tomorrow.</p>

<p><small>I encourage everyone to watch <cite data-id="0C9D2590-892E-444F-972B-A9132CDC2C6B">A Small Light</cite>; the story of Miep and Jan Geis and
their efforts to hide Anne Frank and several other Jews.  We started watching
it, knowing the heartbreak and hurt.  But there are reminders that each little
act of life affirmation is a positive and worthy act.</small></p>
</aside>

<p>Watched episode 2 of <cite data-id="0C9D2590-892E-444F-972B-A9132CDC2C6B">A Small Light</cite>.</p>

<aside  role="note" class="margin">

<p><small>Some “works” I will add to my Bibliography; others I won’t.  <cite data-id="0C9D2590-892E-444F-972B-A9132CDC2C6B">A Small Light</cite> is in
my bibliography and thus uses <code>CITE</code> tag, whereas “Interior Chinatown” is not and
does not.</small></p>
</aside>

<p>We watched the first episode of “Interior Chinatown”.</p>
<p>Practiced testing a radio frequency detector; this one works on vibrate or
making noise.</p>

<p><small>I include a <code>date</code> link as a matter of practice.  This is a custom <span><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" title="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ORG-MODE">📖</a></small>
link
that I have used for a year and a half.  It serves two purposes: generate an
HTML <code>time</code> element and to provide backlink-ing.  I think I could move towards the
native <span>Org-Mode</span>
time element; but for now this is what I have.</small></p>

<p>The dogs woke me up around 4am, and I went outside.  The moon, close to full,
shown through clear skies.  Setting a light the bitter cold snow, which twinkled
as though themselves stars on a white sky.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>Deep indigo shroud<br />
Pierced and gouged<br />
Light reflected spills<br />
Upon white fields<br />
Twinkling a promise<br />
Of the morrow rise<br /></p>

<aside  role="note" class="margin">

<p><small>Often my first entries will be related to what I’ve read.  However, the above
poem needed to be written.  Capturing at least a bit of that memory.</small></p>
</aside>

<p>I read <a href="https://soatok.blog/2025/01/14/dont-use-session-signal-fork/">Don’t Use Session (Signal Fork)</a>; and this stinks of someone creating a
platform that eases well-funded actors attempting to crack encryption.</p>
<p>In reading <a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/01/book-review-rules-for-radicals-a-pragmatic-primer-for-realistic-radicals-by-saul-alinsky/">Book Review: Rules for Radicals- A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic
Radicals by Saul Alinsky</a>, I added <cite data-id="bcb64ed8-9582-41d6-a224-21152330a2f9">Rules for Radicals</cite> by Saul D. Alinksy to my shopping list.  The salient point,
of the review, is the book helps equip change agents by asking “What is your
theory of change?”</p>
<p>Reading <a href="https://nesslabs.com/collective-curiosity?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=collective-curiosity">The Multiplier Effect of Collective Curiosity</a> leads with an ancient
practice of walking and wondering together.  I’ve done this in past meetings and
can say it was some of the most transformative conversations I’ve had.  Rarely
is there “lone genius” instead this is an effort of collaboration and
conversation.  Each building upon what we share.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://lithub.com/lit-hub-daily-january-15-2025/">Lit Hub Daily: January 15, 2025</a> I learned about <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/olga-tokarczuk-empusium-realism/">Olga Tokarczuk’s New Rules
for Realism | The Nation</a> which reviews <cite data-id="c51d973a-21c0-406e-86cd-c334769cfc59">The Empusium</cite> by Olga Tokarczuk; which I added to my shopping list.  Why?  Olga’s
anti-national (e.g. how do we move away from tribalism); and to move forward
we’re going to look at how to reduce our us vs. them mindsets.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://baty.net/journal/2025/01/15/why-am-i-not-taking-pictures">Why am I not taking pictures?</a>, I responded/reflected and wrote 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/01/15/re-why-am-i-not-playing-games/">Re: Why am I not playing games?</a></cite>.  This makes two responses to Jack in as many days.</p>

feed, I turn to my books of poetry.  I grabbed one
and opened to somewhere in the middle.  I tend to reflect on them a bit more,
but this time I didn’t.  I suppose I’ll need to re-read it.</small></p>
</aside>

<p>I read the poem <em>A Thousand Dawns</em> from <cite data-id="70389275-4e89-4682-b134-bed258e555ce">The Half-Life of Angels</cite> by Mark Nepo.</p>

<p><small>Looking to the Fediverse, there’s statements by the Proton’s CEO and then
official Mastodon account that are alarming.  Especially given that their threat
model includes state actors.</small></p>
</aside>

<p>Finding out that Proton’s CEO is teetering on MAGA-boosting is gross.  So I
started exploring other options.  A cursory review is as follows:</p>

<dd>Run Sync-Thing with multiple devices.  I am interested in
Synchronization and thus back-up.  This looks to be a reasonable pathway.
I’ll need to review and establish a Runbook.</dd>
</dl>

<aside  role="note" class="margin">

<p><small>I had heard of SyncThing but didn’t use it.  In part because how it was
originally used was conflated with a gaslighting mansplaining experience.  But
don’t throw the technology used out with the people using it.  Now the people
developing it?</small></p>
</aside>

<p>I started experimenting with syncthing; easy enough to use.  Can replace my
Cloud Drive (if I get one more device in the loop).  However, I must consider
how to make this available for my family.  I’m using <a href="https://github.com/catfriend1/syncthing-android">Syncthing-Fork</a> on my
Android (as found on <a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/users/contrib.html">Community Contributions — Syncthing documentation</a>) and <code>brew install syncthing</code> on my Mac.  It’s just a bit much for non-programmers; but I
think there’s some documentation to help.</p>

<aside  role="note" class="margin">

<p><small>The notes are not chronological; I read the following essay before really diving
into <span><a href="https://syncthing.net/">SyncThing</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “SyncThing”" title="Other site-wide references of “SyncThing”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-SYNCTHING">📖</a></small>
.  While writing this post, I opted to create a glossary entry for
<span>SyncThing</span>
; but did not amend my journal.</small></p>
</aside>

<p>Before dinner, I read <em>Finance is Just Another Word for Other People’s Debt</em> from
<cite data-id="32E68B73-F3F0-49AA-A3FF-81F99F317BF7">The Ultimate Hidden Truth of the World…</cite> by David Graeber.</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="both-nationally-and-internationally-we-are-ruled-by-a-ruling">
<p>
Both nationally and internationally, we are ruled by a ruling class whose profits are based primarily on complex forms of rent extraction, backed by coercive of force.

<aside  role="note" class="margin">

<p><small>I’m not prepared to take these steps, but understanding what folks are
considering is a helpful exercise.  Reminding me a bit of the nano swarms from
<cite data-id="A3028AA7-FCF6-4FC6-9B75-CA203B941730">The Diamond Age</cite> by Neil Stephenson.</small></p>
</aside>

<p>I chuckled as I learned about <a href="https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/">ZADZMO code</a>, namely Nepenthes:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

</blockquote>

<p>I’m eager for <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>
 model collapse, as this hype cycle is one that is hellbent on
consuming all creative output.  But, I think they are fully on the “sunk cost”
fallacy trajectory.</p>

<aside  role="note" class="margin">

<p><small>I drifted off to sleep listening to some Iain M. Banks.</small></p>
</aside>

<p>I read the fourth chapter of <cite data-id="d4e5eb35-b047-43b3-8308-533ad3ae6dde">Consider Phlebas</cite> by Iain M. Banks.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I had an idea of what I wanted to do.  But kept that idea light weight.  And
started building the habit; expanding upon it.  <time datetime="2025-01-13" title="2025-01-13">This week</time> I started adapting
the journal at work; writing to a different file of course.</p>
<p>Building from the same habit, has helped in my day to day work.  Keeping on top
of blockers as well as improving the odds of tracking down past one off work.
I’m thinking how I can build from this habit to incorporate a todo list.</p>
<p>I’ve started many todo lists, but nothing has quite worked.  In that I lose
momentum using them.  Paper lists are the best, and one would think I could
simply “make a file on my computer” for these todo items.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t quite work.  So I’m going to do what’s working and reflect on how
I can build upon that for a todo list.</p>
