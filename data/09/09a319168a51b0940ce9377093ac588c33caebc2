Apple plans to release its first foldable iPhone next year, according to several reporters and analysts who cover the company.<br/>

In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-05/apple-s-make-or-break-moment-with-tariffs-ai-google-deal-epic-games-lawsuit-mab141ke"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the foldable iPhone will offer two key advantages over other foldable smartphones.<br/>
<br/>
First, he said the foldable iPhone will have a "nearly invisible" crease when unfolded. This means the device's rumored 7.8-inch to 8-inch inner display would have a more seamless design, for an uninterrupted viewing experience.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple looks to stand out from the competition by making the crease less noticeable when the phone is in the open position," he wrote.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the foldable iPhone will be equipped with a "much higher-quality hinge" compared to some other foldable smartphones, according to Gurman. He did not elaborate about this aspect, but Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">previously said</a> the hinge will be made with a mix of titanium and stainless steel.<br/>

He expects the device to be as thin as 4.5mm when unfolded, and between 9mm and 9.5mm when folded.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/foldable-iphone-two-key-advantages/">Foldable iPhone Said to Have Two Key Advantages</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-said-to-have-two-key-advantages.2456532/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
