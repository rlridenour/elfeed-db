<p>In the latest development over a US airstrike on an alleged Venezuelan drug‑smuggling boat in the Caribbean Sea on September 2, the family of Colombian fisherman Alejandro Andres Carranza Medina has filed the first formal legal complaint against the United States at the Inter‑American Commission on Human Rights, alleging human rights violations and unlawful killing of civilians. US officials say the military initially hit the suspected smuggling vessel as part of President Trump’s new campaign against drug‑running boats, and later carried out a follow‑on strike against people in the water near the wreckage. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who authorized the first strike, now defends the overall operation but says he did not witness survivors or the second strike in real time, citing the &quot;fog of war&quot; and insisting the on‑scene admiral made the proper call. The incident has triggered bipartisan scrutiny in the US Congress and concerns from legal experts that the follow‑up attack may have violated the laws of armed conflict if it targeted people who were already hors de combat. The broader anti‑drug maritime campaign, ordered by President Trump in September and described by Hegseth as having &quot;only just begun,&quot; has reportedly caused more than 80 deaths and is likely to face growing international and legal challenges.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lH7OjcRMYu8dwD2NEWz6hBj5NGhnQQQD0euTMBQb-Ngz1Ypv5yJ4gicoH82q_0rHhnAg6u42KwrlpgxZN-UUhTJzabEPstL7HKRgoOwwvmB1m_NrYgbhbBQd2379ngNR7CQ6HWseKZw7UUqO9Lx1H61vP2OAh1RgUf0p3mo3wueI-uyxuuoSieTiNYDrR3RrzpNET0mONfrtSTvuYIoHDkKidLwUZFjFmn545cSXnZejnPYq1r__MTul5E0xlLvTfolzhRSrKFvXx1egQQ' alt='US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington amid questions over Caribbean boat strikes.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Evolving government account: Media timelines show the administration first acknowledged only a single strike on the Venezuelan boat, later confirming multiple munitions were used and that a second engagement hit people in the water after the initial blast.</li><li>Hegseth’s real‑time role: Hegseth told a White House cabinet meeting that he watched the first attack live but &quot;didn’t stick around&quot; afterward, learning of the follow‑on strike several hours later while maintaining that commanders followed his guidance.</li><li>Bipartisan congressional scrutiny: Lawmakers from both US parties have demanded detailed briefings, with some Democrats openly questioning whether a war crime occurred and some Republicans focusing on whether military rules of engagement were properly followed.</li><li>Alleged civilian identity: Colombian President Gustavo Petro has said Carranza was a fisherman, not a trafficker, and his family’s petition to the human rights commission argues he was an unarmed civilian killed during a US anti‑drug operation.</li><li>Campaign scope and rhetoric: Hegseth has said the United States has &quot;only just begun&quot; targeting suspected drug boats and that President Trump is prepared to authorize strikes on vessels linked to narcotics for the US market, including from other countries.</li></ul><blockquote>This is called the fog of war. - Pete Hegseth</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Department of Defense: Hegseth argues that he saw only an exploding boat with no visible survivors and that the on‑scene admiral &quot;made the right call&quot; within the fog of war when ordering further action..
