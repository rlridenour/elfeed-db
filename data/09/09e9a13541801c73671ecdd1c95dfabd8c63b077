<p>Vanity Fair published an excerpt from Chris Whipple’s new book on the final years of Joe Biden’s presidency, under the headline “Did Aides Cover Up His Mental State — or Was It Group Delusion?” (<a href="https://apple.news/ANs1GK_4ISEikICuDBenaSA">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The president’s wobbly state should have been a flashing warning
light. At his first meeting with Biden, Ron Klain, his former
White House chief of staff, who was in charge of debate prep, was
startled. He’d never seen Biden so exhausted and out of it. He
seemed unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. The
president appeared obsessed with foreign policy and uninterested
in his second-term plans. During one prep session in Aspen Lodge,
the presidential cabin, Biden suddenly got up, walked out to the
pool, collapsed on a lounge chair, and fell sound asleep. Yet his
advisers were undaunted. With unintended irony, one of them
explained their strategy to me: “An early debate would quiet fears
that the president was infirm.”</p>
