If you&rsquo;ve been using Org-mode for a while, you&rsquo;re probably familiar with its table editing functionality and may even know that you can use that functionality anywhere in Emacs with <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Orgtbl-Mode.html">orgtbl-mode</a>. For most non-Org applications, of course, those tables will be in some sort of comment.

Andrew over at the <a href="https://flandrew.srht.site">Listful Andrew site</a> has a <a href="https://flandrew.srht.site/listful/org-tables-in-comments-and-docstrings-in-emacs-lisp-and-bash.html">useful post</a> on how to do that. It&rsquo;s a little more finicky than you might think because the editing won&rsquo;t work if the table lines are commented out. It&rsquo;s easy to work around that, of course, but Andrew offers some other strategies.
</p>
<p>
When you&rsquo;re in Elisp, the easiest way to add a table to a comment is to add it do a Docstring. That&rsquo;s easy and the table can be edited at will. Andrew offer another method using his custom description macro. Most of us won&rsquo;t have that macro, of course, but it&rsquo;s another strategy.

<p>
Finally, Andrew considers adding tables to Bash comments. The problems are similar to those encountered with Elisp: you can&rsquo;t edit tables whose rows are commented out. As with Elisp, that&rsquo;s easily worked around but again there are better ways.
</p>
<p>
One way is to use the null command <code>:</code> to introduce the comment string. See Andrew&rsquo;s post for the details. Another way is to use a here document or a here string. Again, see Andrew&rsquo;s post for the details.
</p>
<p>
Tables in comments isn&rsquo;t something that you need all the time but it&rsquo;s nice to have to ability to add them when you do. Andrew&rsquo;s post is a nice demonstration of how to do that.</p>
