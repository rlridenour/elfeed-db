<p>In the latest development, Thailand reported a second fatal crane collapse in two days, after an elevated-highway construction crane toppled onto a busy roadway in Samut Sakhon province near Bangkok, killing two people on Thursday. The incident followed Wednesday’s disaster in northeastern Thailand, where a construction crane fell onto a passenger train, triggering a derailment and fire that killed at least 32 people and injured dozens. Thai officials said the same construction firm was involved in both projects, putting oversight and site safety practices under sharp scrutiny. Authorities have said they are investigating, while the back-to-back incidents have renewed public focus on preventing construction hazards around major transport routes.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Chsst2P4FULEtvGgMN-IhGefHcDJ0yWIZlA7kq2ku9bShCyULCa4sh5MWpP2v6I-BxryfMEZqxQHvaXwgyYnTSz6enBebxcva28O0ho-cUglZyC-b3puyfXj84_Bq6BBSXNv3cMB7sdB5In8MabyXB6sqFh66GmkkPDMRH9Ts2e3Hhks-GrSS4tYCgecdT8wt98' alt='The site where a construction crane collapsed onto a highway in Samut Sakhon Province, Thailand, on Thursday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Dashcam evidence: Video shared publicly, including dashcam footage, captured the moment the highway crane fell, helping investigators and the public understand how quickly the danger unfolded.</li><li>Roadway impacts: In the Samut Sakhon crash, the falling structure struck vehicles on the road below, underscoring how construction work over live traffic can amplify risk beyond the worksite.</li><li>Train casualties: Reports described the train incident as a fiery derailment in Sikhio district, Nakhon Ratchasima province, with at least 66 people injured in addition to the confirmed deaths.</li><li>Minister linkage: A Thai minister publicly linked the two accidents to the same company, a step that can speed accountability by clarifying who held key roles across both sites.</li><li>Safety spotlight: The second crash, coming so soon after the rail tragedy, has intensified calls to re-check construction safety procedures around highways and rail corridors.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Thai government (transport/construction oversight): Officials said the same firm was involved in both crane projects and indicated authorities were moving to scrutinize responsibility and safety after the back-to-back accidents.
