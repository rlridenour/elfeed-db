<p>I&#8217;ve got some news about <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu">Mac Power Users</a>, and it comes with mixed emotions.</p>



<p>After seven years of podcasting together, <a href="https://512pixels.net/">Stephen Hackett</a> is stepping away from the show. Stephen has become a dear friend, and I will really miss our weekly conversations. He was also an outstanding podcasting partner, handling problems before I even realized they existed. The show wouldn&#8217;t be what it is today without him.</p>



<p>Stephen isn&#8217;t disappearing. He&#8217;ll continue on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">Connected</a> and focus more of his time behind the scenes. I completely understand his decision. Mac Power Users is a very time-intensive commitment, and sometimes life requires you to make hard choices about where to put your energy.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m also excited to announce that <a href="https://stephenrobles.com/">Stephen Robles</a> will be joining me as the new co-host.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to Stephen&#8217;s podcast and watching his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@beardfm">YouTube channel</a> for some time now. When I started thinking about who could fill this role, he was at the top of my list. Stephen views himself as a teacher, and while he&#8217;s become a very successful YouTuber, he also has years of experience as a podcaster. A good MPU host needs to be knowledgeable, willing to do the work, and fun to talk to. Stephen checks all of those boxes. Every conversation I&#8217;ve had with him throughout this process further validates my decision to bring him on board.</p>



<p>The mission and spirit of Mac Power Users remain the same. We&#8217;re still here to help you get the most from your Apple technology. Stephen and I have been talking, and we&#8217;ve got several interesting ideas to take the show even further.</p>



<p>I know transitions can feel strange. You&#8217;ve spent years listening to Stephen Hackett and me riff on workflows and gear. But I&#8217;m confident you&#8217;ll love Stephen Robles once you get to know him. Give him a chance.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the timeline: Next week will be Stephen Hackett&#8217;s farewell show. (If you have any questions you&#8217;d like me to add to that episode for Stephen, get them to me in the next 36 hours). The week after, Stephen Robles takes the chair for the first time.</p>



<p>I hope you&#8217;ll join me in thanking Stephen Hackett for seven wonderful years and welcoming Stephen Robles to the Mac Power Users family.</p>
