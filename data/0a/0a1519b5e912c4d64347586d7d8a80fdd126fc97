<p>This is the third installment in the occasional series, <a class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" href="https://dailynous.com/tag/philosophy-department-survival-strategies/">Philosophy Department Survival Strategies</a>. In this post, our topic is about philosophers working with members of other departments at their university or college. [This post will be pinned to the top of the main page for a couple of days.]

<p>How many of your colleagues in other departments at your university actually know what you and other philosophers do?</p>
<p>How many of your colleagues in other departments at your university would be negatively affected if most or all of the philosophy faculty were laid off?</p>
<p>I think the most common answer to both these questions is something like &#8220;not many at all.&#8221; And that&#8217;s not good.</p>
<p>Ignorance and indifference are risk factors for philosophy departments. If other faculty on campus don&#8217;t know much about what philosophy is, it will be harder to make the case to them that philosophy is valuable. And if people don&#8217;t see philosophy or philosophers as relevant to or important for their work, they&#8217;re going to be less likely to care about, or join in action to fight, cuts to philosophy departments.</p>
<p>These risk factors that can be ameliorated, though. We can overcome ignorance about and indifference to what we do among our campus colleagues by working with them. Ideally, by the time the axe is raised, philosophers are so significantly a part of the work life of our colleagues across campus that the idea of cutting philosophy would seem to many of them a tremendous loss to the university.</p>
<p>Even though faculty governance appears on the wane, professors across campus are likely going to be instrumental in helping philosophy departments survive, not just as concerned colleagues, but as members of the faculty senate, as appointees to the committees that play a role in budgeting and restructuring, and as current and future administrators.</p>
<p>And <em>of course</em> such interdepartmental cooperation can be quite valuable apart from its contribution to the mere survival of a philosophy department.</p>
<p>The value of collaborating with colleagues across campus is something that <em>some</em> philosophers and philosophy departments have long appreciated and acted on. Philosophers have been co-principal investigators on interdisciplinary grants with campus colleagues in other departments. They have co-authored with non-philosophers, and participated in multi-disciplinary events and reading groups. They have established interdisciplinary centers and programs, etc. Yet, as reflected in the answers to those questions near the start of this post, it seems like there is much more we can do.</p>
<p>Please use the comments as a space for sharing ideas about valuable collaborations between philosophers and our colleagues in other departments on campus. Examples of what you have done, or what your department or school has done, are especially welcome, as are new ideas and the brainstorming of possibilities. Reflections on how interdepartmental collaboration by professors is or should be recognized by evaluation criteria is also welcome.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/03/06/philosophy-department-survival-strategies-interdepartmental-cooperation-on-campus/">Philosophy Department Survival Strategies: Interdepartmental Cooperation on Campus</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
