While all Macs are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/apple-celebrates-five-years-of-m1-chip/">now powered by Apple's custom-designed chips</a>, a new rumor claims that Apple may rekindle its partnership with Intel, albeit in a new and limited way.<br/>
<br/>

Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1994422001952555318">said</a> Intel is expected to begin shipping Apple's lowest-end M-series chip as early as mid-2027. <br/>
<br/>
Kuo said Apple plans to utilize Intel's <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/process/18a.html">18A process</a>, which is the "earliest available sub-2nm advanced node manufactured in North America."<br/>
<br/>
If this rumor proves to be accurate, Intel could supply Apple with M6 or M7 chips for future MacBook Air, iPad Air, and iPad Pro models at a minimum. However, while previous Intel chips for Macs were designed by Intel and based on x86 architecture, M-series chips are designed by Apple and use Arm architecture. Intel would only assist with manufacturing.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC would continue to supply the majority of Apple's M-series chips.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said that Apple choosing to have Intel supply its lowest-end M-series chip would appease the Trump administration's desire for "Made in USA" products, and it would also help Apple to diversify its supply chain for manufacturing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple began transitioning away from Intel processors in Macs in 2020, and its own M-series chips continue to provide industry-leading performance per watt.<br/>
