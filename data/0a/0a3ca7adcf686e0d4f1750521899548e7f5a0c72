<p>A while back I ran into an issue where I made a PDF with some text in it, and I
could see the text in my PDF viewer, but when I printed it, it disappeared.
Eventually I figured out that converting the font to a TTF stopped the problem,
but I had no idea WHY that fixed it.</p>
<p>When I found the workaround I posted something like &ldquo;PDFs are weird&rdquo; on
Mastodon and shockingly someone replied with this incredible deep dive by Leah Neukirchen that explains exactly why this problem happened (even though I didn&rsquo;t mention ANY specifics about my problem at all):
