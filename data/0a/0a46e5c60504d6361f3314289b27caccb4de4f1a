While the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-macbook-pro-with-m5-chip/">updated with an M5 chip</a> in October, we are still waiting for higher-end MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, and there are some signs that might point towards a late January launch this year.<br/>
<br/>

First, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/apple-creator-studio/">Apple's new Creator Studio bundle</a> of creative apps launches on Wednesday, January 28. Given that Creator Studio includes many professional Mac apps, such as Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and Pixelmator Pro, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3031242/apple-creator-studio-m5-pro-max-macbook-pro.html"><em>Macworld</em> speculated</a> that the week of January 28 would be a fitting time for Apple to release new MacBook Pro models too.<br/>
<br/>
Second, Apple's next quarterly earnings call is scheduled for <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">Thursday, January 29</a>, and the company has introduced new products shortly before these calls on numerous occasions over the years and touched on them in the opening remarks.<br/>
<br/>
Third, there is precedent, as Apple unveiled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-announces-m2-pro-macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro models with M2 Pro and M2 Max chips</a> with a press release in January 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Again, all of this is speculation, so do not set your expectations too high. But, sometimes where there is smoke there is fire.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the M5 chip, the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro received only one notable change last year: PCIe 5.0 storage. Apple says this results in up to 2× faster SSD read and write speeds compared to the previous-generation model.<br/>
<br/>
The higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are likewise expected to have few other changes.<br/>
<br/>
Bigger changes to the MacBook Pro are expected with the two-generations-away models, in either late 2026 or at some point in 2027. Rumored upgrades include an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/macbook-pro-oled-touch-screen/">OLED display with touchscreen capabilities</a>, a thinner design, built-in cellular connectivity, and M6 chips manufactured with TSMC's advanced 2nm process, for even greater year-over-year performance gains. For that reason, it will probably be wise to skip the MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips unless you really need to upgrade.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/macbook-pro-january/">Will Apple Announce New MacBook Pros This January?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-apple-announce-new-macbook-pros-this-january.2476038/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
