It is particularly impressive that tvOS 26 supports the original Apple TV HD model from 2015, although the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/tvos-26-liquid-glass-redesign-older-models/">new Liquid Glass design and some other added features are limited</a> to the newer Apple TV 4K (2nd generation) and Apple TV 4K (3rd generation).<br/>

Apple says the first tvOS 26 public beta will be available next month, and the update will be released to the general public later this year.<br/>
