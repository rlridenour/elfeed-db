<blockquote>
  <p>Electronics imported to the United States will be exempt from
President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, according to a <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDHSCBP/bulletins/3db9e55">US
Customs and Border Protection notice</a> posted late Friday.
Smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts are
among the exempted products. The exemption applies to products
entering the United States or removed from warehouses as early as
April 5, according to the notice.</p>

<p>The move comes after the Trump administration imposed a minimum
tariff rate of 145% on Chinese goods imported to the United
States. The tariffs would have a major impact on tech giants like
Apple, which make iPhones and other products in China.</p>

<p>Roughly 90% of Apple’s iPhone production and assembly is based in
China, according to Wedbush Securities’ estimates. Analysts at
Wedbush on Saturday called the tariff exclusion, “the best news
possible for tech investors.”</p>
