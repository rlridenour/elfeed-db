<p>In the latest development after a catastrophic blaze at the Wang Fuk Court public housing estate in Hong Kong’s Tai Po district, authorities say at least 151 residents have died, making it the city’s deadliest fire in roughly seven decades. The fire, which started last Wednesday and burned through seven of the estate’s eight apartment towers housing about 4,600 people, took around two days to fully extinguish and left entire stairwells and corridors charred and unstable. Officials now say that protective construction netting wrapped around the buildings failed to meet required fire resistance standards, and the anti‑corruption agency has arrested 13 people linked to the construction firm and its consultants on suspicion of wrongdoing. As the city mourns with candlelight vigils and flower tributes, the government has begun distributing emergency cash to affected households and is working on measures to ease mortgage burdens for surviving homeowners while search teams continue to look for the missing. Migrant domestic workers, many of whom lived and worked in the complex, are holding community prayers and facing uncertainty about jobs, visas and housing after losing employers or their own rooms in the fire.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/tm6gbdmLrIL9-3XL-qYoXMysj1EyyvrkVdccewn8Sx6gTQ06dBfNYY4aIEFrFspmVOGAxB1pyg89-m7svg8RD88Yu7hXXqYN_g0Y3rB__LyQRL-Ytpi102eEENiD7TlKUhMPpKSb-CvthX8H96oS-GpY94z1L0GDBl5tTgDInmFYAg7snKAJdpvDL6ytdVGAQnoh7G_mTCNB6yealo6PsMlZCTnRj0gJOZZdVeR1J1oKBUKRb7B0IzrLO4iAklJ4AwIv7Skz03VwN9flblYw1rXULn7GAiIdvjXKV4x8ARgbWoRmAuoHiWYJM--0u_ZsI5ieol1H1ZJzZmiQXq-nk_pZMiNmw6CAREKUS7746Ld3yw1Wx6kTTq5h1FkBZLDZgrMsgQRWy8s2ZtitapKveKRSlERN0E0-Zi_blHsgVoKXxYNt3iJjoQJ2wPYNKtBNWu6gLWgW8y4aX5hWIP0HxZUX5yYTGsk1S01M8w' alt='Mourners gather outside the Wang Fuk Court estate in Hong Kong to leave flowers and pay tribute after the deadly fire.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Construction arrests: Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption detained 13 people, including directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company involved with the estate, as part of an inquiry into how non‑compliant netting was approved and installed.</li><li>Domestic worker losses: Indonesia’s consulate reports at least nine Indonesian domestic workers have died and three more remain in critical condition, while migrant groups say hundreds of helpers have lost jobs, belongings and documents tied to employers who died or are missing.</li><li>Public anger: Large crowds have gathered at the estate with flowers and candles, while residents and activists voice frustration over fire safety standards and alleged official failures, prompting Hong Kong’s leader to pledge a thorough investigation and safety review across similar buildings.</li><li>National security warning: Chinese authorities have cautioned that any demonstrations arising from the tragedy that they deem &quot;anti‑China&quot; could be prosecuted under the national security law, even as people continue lining up to mourn at the site.</li><li>Emergency support: The Hong Kong government says more than 1,700 affected households have already received one‑off emergency cash payments, and officials are arranging temporary housing and mental‑health support for hundreds of displaced residents relocated from the damaged towers.</li></ul><blockquote>We are heartbroken and devastated we’ve lost friends, family and our homes - A migrant domestic worker grieving at a community gathering</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Hong Kong government: Officials have promised a full probe into why the fire spread so quickly and say inspections of similar public housing blocks and their construction materials will be expanded across the city.
