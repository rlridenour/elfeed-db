<p>Israeli tank fire and airstrikes hit multiple parts of the Gaza Strip on February 4, killing at least 17–21 Palestinians in morning attacks. Hospitals and Gaza health officials said many of the dead were women and children. Several reports said the strikes came as a ceasefire that began on October 10, 2025, appeared to be fraying. Israel said it acted after gunfire targeted its troops and seriously wounded an Israeli servicemember (described variously as a soldier, reservist, or officer). Meanwhile, Palestinian officials and the Red Crescent said patient evacuations through the Rafah crossing into Egypt were halted or repeatedly postponed just days after the crossing partly reopened, adding new uncertainty for people seeking urgent medical care outside Gaza. Some patients and escorts did cross into Egypt on February 3, according to officials cited by multiple outlets, but movements on February 4 were disrupted by the new restrictions. Gazan health officials cited by Dawn said Wednesday’s attacks raised the number of Palestinians killed since the border crossing reopened to 28, after Israeli strikes on Saturday (before the reopening) killed more than 30. Israel said those earlier strikes followed an incident in which gunmen emerged from a tunnel in an area under Israeli control.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/YY3eIzND3ZNeEUnMao7oYXFr6PH9YfOO2y1Z9U3Mq9wJ_40vqOrftKl8ZtVoH3bL1hvCjzEXn0Zxxw07UpC78c9DBcLX9EdT_z7ImcspHy00sM0R4F8HvSaqo0D-AwURBqGjLQopS7RuDjs1zGi1_RQGHHFN0qRhoWPkqDuUm5Prp6YxG2nOLLOz7OigYfWxO5lK2apjRHKdFUuw0RjYT8V9uHb2yfYqKW93DlySaK81RGNx6wEizrykEr_lPafiP0yKA2jK1tqzOq7h7w' alt='Civil Defense members inspect the site of an Israeli strike on a tent camp sheltering displaced Palestinians, in Khan Younis, February 4, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who was killed: Hospital and emergency officials said those killed included seven women, five children, and a paramedic; reports also cited a 5-month-old and a 10-day-old baby among the dead.</li><li>Follow-up strike detail: Health officials said a medic who rushed to help victims of a strike in Khan Younis was killed when a second attack hit the same location.</li><li>Evacuation disruption: A Red Crescent spokesperson said patients were told to prepare for travel via Rafah, then informed that the evacuation had been postponed.</li><li>Deaths since reopening / earlier strikes: Dawn cited Gazan health officials as saying the Feb. 4 attacks brought the number killed since Rafah reopened to 28.
