<p>Ten years ago I played two small roles in the release of the aforelinked <em>Becoming Steve Jobs</em>. First, I got to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/03/02/becoming-steve-jobs">announce the book</a> here at Daring Fireball, after having been sent an advance copy a few weeks earlier. My praise for the book then was glowing, but in hindsight, I think I undersold just how good — and how essential — it is. At the time of its launch, the book remained in the shadow of Walter Isaacson’s Jobs biography. Ten years later, I refer back to <em>Becoming Steve Jobs</em> regularly; Isaacson’s book almost never.</p>

<p>Second, the SoHo Apple Store in New York hosted a “Meet the Authors” event, and I had the pleasure of playing host for the interview. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/brent-schlender-rick-tetzeli/id980487310?mt=2">It’s still available</a>, both as video and audio. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/03/27/schlender-tetzeli-interview">And as I wrote at the time</a>, “I’m kind of proud that it got flagged as ‘explicit’ — but that was Bill Gates’s fault.”</p>
