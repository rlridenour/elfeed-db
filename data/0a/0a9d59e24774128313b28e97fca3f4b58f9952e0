Over at <a href="https://themkat.net">The MKat</a>, Marie K. Ekeberg has a post that brings me back to my earliest days of using Emacs. Before I was assimilated, I tried several times to warm up to Emacs but it wouldn&rsquo;t take. Ekeberg&rsquo;s post reminds me why. It was what I considered the schizophrenic default scrolling. You would move the cursor down the screen and suddenly, about three quarters of the way down, the screen would jump several lines. Every time  I saw that, I would abandon my attempt to embrace Emacs and run screaming back to Vim.

In her post on <a href="https://themkat.net/2025/03/25/simple_smoother_emacs_scrolling.html">smoother scrolling</a>, Ekeberg offers an explanation for this bizarre behavior that I&rsquo;m pretty sure is correct. The TL;DR is that in the old days, when Emacs was developed, scrolling was an expensive operation so rather than scroll by line, Emacs would scroll by (essentially) half pages.

I have no idea why the default hasn&rsquo;t long since been changed but as far as I know, it hasn&rsquo;t. I say, &ldquo;as far as I know&rdquo; because years and years ago I did what Ekeberg suggests and implemented smooth scrolling. I haven&rsquo;t looked back.

It turns out that fixing this is far from trivial. I have no memory of how I figured it out but I do know that it involved pleading with the Internet for an answer. Take a look at Ekeberg&rsquo;s post to see the answer. What she suggests is essentially what I did. As I said, not at all obvious.

It&rsquo;s odd how a simple thing like scrolling can ruin your appreciation of Emacs but it sure did affect mine. Don&rsquo;t let that happen to you. Take a look at Ekeberg&rsquo;s post and find peace of mind.</p>
