<p>Clashes broke out in Milan on Saturday after a large march against the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics ended near the Olympic Village. Police used tear gas and water cannons after some protesters threw stones, fireworks, and firecrackers. Organizers and participants said they were protesting what they called environmentally and economically “unsustainable” Games, and Deutsche Welle reported that some also objected to the presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Elsewhere, Italy’s rail network also saw disruption that day. Officials reported damage to cables on the Bologna–Venice line and an arson attack on a traction substation on the Ancona–Rimini line; RT, citing Italian media, said no one had claimed responsibility and authorities were looking into possible anarchist involvement. RT also reported that Transport Minister Matteo Salvini called the rail incidents a premeditated attack meant to harm Italy. The unrest came as the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics began, with events spread across the host region.</p><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Crowd size: Around 10,000 people joined the anti-Olympics march in Milan, according to RT’s report.</li><li>Clash location/targets: Euronews said clashes broke out in Milan’s Corvetto neighbourhood at the end of the demonstration.
