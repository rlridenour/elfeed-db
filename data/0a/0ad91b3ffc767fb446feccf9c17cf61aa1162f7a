<p>In a rather genius moment, I scheduled a meeting to review an intake form with the crew at 13:00 today, when I had a doctor&rsquo;s appointment at 14:45 (travel time is approximately 40 minutes) that I had forgotten about.</p>
<p>The meeting, of course, took longer than planned, which meant I had to rush and take a Lyft instead of the subway. I got there on time, even though we got stuck behind a truck that was backing into a construction site. I love me some car horn symphony and yelling.</p>
<p>I did manage to get to the doctor on time, and decided to walk back to West Side through Central Park, which was nice, besides the heat. Heavy and humid, it was especially punishing when I couldn&rsquo;t find shade.</p>
<p>On the train back home, I realized the ride was a bit longer than it should have been, and the station numbers seemed off. Turns out I forgot I was on the D train and kept riding it into the Bronx instead of getting off on time and switching.</p>
<p>Got some time to chill at home with a cool shower and a nap, and now I&rsquo;m about to watch X-Files with NK. So, you know, not everything is annoying; some things are still nice.</p>
