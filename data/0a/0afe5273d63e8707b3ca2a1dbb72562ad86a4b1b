<p><a href="https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/people/detail/260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B. Scot Rouse</a>, a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley who is assisting the Foundation with the project, writes that there are &#8220;more than one hundred cassettes of lectures&#8221; from which the archive would be assembled.</p>
<p>The archive is the first step in a three-year plan &#8220;to transform Hubert L. Dreyfus’s archival legacy into a living intellectual resource.&#8221;</p>
<p>He <a href="https://withoutwhy.substack.com/p/the-hubert-dreyfus-audio-archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides some details</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>During nearly fifty years of teaching at Berkeley, from 1968 until his death in 2017, Dreyfus became a celebrated and often controversial voice in philosophy, especially for his prescient and ultimately vindicated critique of early AI. He was also a legendary teacher, always thinking aloud at the edge of his own understanding, drawing students into an adventure of shared inquiry. The surviving recordings bring listeners directly into that atmosphere: philosophy as a vital, searching, shared practice.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Dreyfus left behind an extraordinary archive: more than one hundred cassettes of lectures on Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, existential philosophy, and beyond; seminars with figures such as Michel Foucault, Jürgen Habermas, and Charles Taylor; and rare recordings dating back to his 1964 presentation of “Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence” to the RAND Corporation, with obscenities uncensored! In the early 2000s, his lectures reached wide audiences through iTunes, as noted in the </em>Los Angeles Times<em>. When those lectures disappeared from iTunes, they survived only in dispersed, degraded, and often mislabeled copies spread across the internet.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We are raising funds to create a professionally curated, web-based audio archive of Professor Dreyfus’s lectures, restoring audio quality, organizing materials, and integrating syllabi and course documents that have never been publicly available.</em></p>
<p>The Foundation aims to raise $50,000.
