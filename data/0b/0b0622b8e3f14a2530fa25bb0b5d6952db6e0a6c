<p>A few weeks ago I commented on <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/12/08/ptpl-185-calendar-txt-planner-md-russ-sharek-plain-text-clown" title="wikilink">Russ Sharek’s answers to eight questions about his plain text lifestyle</a>. The questions were posed by Scott Nesbitt, who no longer maintains <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/articles.html" target="_blank">his website</a> and has therefore discontinued the series.</p>
<p>Here are the questions so you can consider how you would answer them. My answers follow.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When did you start using plain text?</li>
<li>Why did you start using plain text?</li>
<li>What do you use plain text for?</li>
<li>What keeps you using plain text?</li>
<li>Do you use any markup or formatting languages? If so, which ones and why?</li>
<li>What are your favourite plain text tools or applications?</li>
<li>Is there one tool you can’t do without?</li>
<li>Is there anything you can’t do with plain text?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you end up putting your answers online, use the hashtag #WhyPlainText to keep the movement going. Mention me on Mastodon (@ellane@pkm.social) and I’ll take a look.</p>

<h4 id="when-did-you-start-using-plain-text"><strong>1 - When did you start using plain text?</strong></h4>
<p>In 2016 I came across Cal Newport’s <a href="https://calnewport.com/deep-habits-workingmemory-txt-the-most-important-productivity-tool-youve-never-heard-of" target="_blank">WorkingMemory.txt</a> article, and caught the bug. I began with dated entries in pure text, no fancy stuff.</p>
<p>Here’s one of them (not sure what’s going on with those dates):</p>
<p><img src="https://ellanew.com/Posts/ptpl-191-2016-plain-text-1.png" alt="Lines of text with details of a purchase. The file name has 2016-12-20 in it, while the date of the purchase is shown as 2016-12-26"></p>
<p>And here’s another, where I’m trying to use Markdown but don’t yet have the hang of it:</p>
<p><img src="https://ellanew.com/Posts/ptpl-191-markdown-mistakes-1.png" alt="Lines of text showing things like “#####end of year reflection”"></p>
<h4 id="why-did-you-start-using-plain-text"><strong>2 - Why did you start using plain text?</strong></h4>
<p>Because I hated the feeling of being trapped in regular apps, and loved the idea of complete autonomy over my text. The thought of freeing my work from locked in formats really appealed to me and became a bit of an obsession. Last time I checked, it still is!</p>
<h4 id="what-do-you-use-plain-text-for"><strong>3 - What do you use plain text for?</strong></h4>
<p>Planning time / events, tasks, projects. General notes. My blog. Almost every aspect of my life is organised in plain text, via the <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com" target="_blank">Johnny Decimal system</a>. There’s a lot more I <em>could</em> do with plain text that I choose not to. See question 6.</p>
<h4 id="what-keeps-you-using-plain-text"><strong>4 - What keeps you using plain text?</strong></h4>
<p>The freedom, flexibility, and autonomy it gives me. I can’t bear the thought of handing the keys of my data to an app I have no control over. Another key reason I continue with plain text is that it keeps me focused on my work, rather than the tools I use to get it done. I’m a highly distractable person with a deep-rooted distrust of gatekeeper apps and fragile systems; plain text keeps me grounded.</p>
<h4 id="do-you-use-any-markup-or-formatting-languages-if-so-which-ones-and-why"><strong>5 - Do you use any markup or formatting languages? If so, which ones and why?</strong></h4>
<p>I use Markdown for formatting and wikilinks for convenience. See <a href="https://ellanew.com/2026/01/12/ptpl-190-keeping-plain-text-the-right-kind-of-boring" title="wikilink"><span class="small-caps">PTPL</span> 190 - Plain Text Doesn’t Have to Be Ugly, It Just Has to Stay Boring in the Right Ways</a></p>
<h4 id="what-are-your-favourite-plain-text-tools-or-applications"><strong>6 - What are your favourite plain text tools or applications?</strong></h4>
<p>I began in TextEdit, and from there moved to Notational Velocity followed by The Archive, which is fantastic if you don’t need subfolders. These days I use Obsidian, iA Writer, <span class="small-caps">VS</span> Code. Sometimes I’ll go full metal plain text and live in TextEdit for a day or so. Conspicuous by their absence are Vim and Org mode: highly capable, but the learning curve and rabbit-hole potential are not where I’m at at the moment.</p>
<p>There’s plenty I like to see in a Markdown-capable app, but the only truly essential thing is a good search function across multiple files and folders/subfolders.</p>
<h4 id="is-there-one-tool-you-cant-do-without"><strong>7 - Is there one tool you can’t do without?</strong></h4>
<p>No, but there are some I don’t want to give up. I’ve deliberately structured my files so that no tool is irreplaceable. The tool I’d miss the most is Obsidian, with its optional Sync service. Obsidian works so well on my Mac and iPhone I really would hate to see it disappear (but I’d get over it).</p>
<h4 id="is-there-anything-you-cant-do-with-plain-text"><strong>8 - Is there anything you can’t do with plain text?</strong></h4>
<p>I’m reading this question as<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Is there anything you can’t do with plain text, that you would like to be able to do?”</p>
<p>Graphics and audio files aside, little comes to mind (that’s important to me) that I can’t do with plain text. I’m not trying to control everything with text, though I’m told Emacs lets you do that.</p>
<p>Plain text for me is digital paper with benefits. It’s a low-cognitive-load way to keep me focused and to future-proof my work.</p>
<h3 id="in-sum">In sum</h3>
<p>Answering these questions reinforced my commitment to maintain the interoperability of my text files. I’m using some Obsidian-only features for convenience, but the core of everything I do is always ready to go in (almost) any text editor.</p>
<p>I’m proud of myself for sticking with this journey despite the allure of the shiny apps that claim to solve all our problems.</p>
