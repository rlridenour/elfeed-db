<p>So I just discovered <code>wgrep</code> mode of a grep buffer in Emacs and it&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I often use <code>projectile-ripgrep</code> if I need to find something in the project I&rsquo;m working on.
But if I wanted to rename some variables or strings that I grepped I had to go and manually update them or use something like
<code>projectile-replace</code>.</p>
<p>But turns out there is <code>wgrep</code> mode that is available from <code>projectile-ripgrep</code> (<code>*rg*</code>) buffer or from <code>*grep*</code> buffer.</p>
<p>In case of you <code>ripgrep</code> you just press letter <code>e</code> and now you can edit anything you want. Then you press <code>C-x C-s</code> and now all the changes
are made. Amazing.</p>
<p>Here is an example. Let&rsquo;s try to find and replace <code>projectile-</code> string in this blog:</p>
<p>Here is what was found (image is clickable)</p>

<p>now I press <code>e</code> and I can edit the buffer. It says this in the message area:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://codelearn.me/assets/img/emacs-wgrep-message.png"><img alt="wgrep view" src="https://codelearn.me/assets/img/emacs-wgrep-message.png" width="550px"/></a></p>
<p>Now I changed few occurrences of the <code>projectile-</code> to <code>project-</code> and pressed <code>C-x C-s</code> and now those two files are edited without me even visiting them.</p>

<p>You can save all unsaved buffers with <code>C-x s</code></p>
<p>Incredible discovery. I&rsquo;m going to use it all the time now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure though what kind of feature is this. It&rsquo;s not a package that I had to install. It&rsquo;s just there and it works.</p>
