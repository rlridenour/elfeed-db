<p> The US government’s latest recommendations acknowledge that password composition and reset rules are not just annoying, but counterproductive. The story of why password rules were recommended and enforced without scientific evidence since their invention in 1979 is a story of brilliant people, at the very top of their field, whose well-intentioned recommendations led to decades of ignorance. These mistakes are worth studying, in part, because the people making them were so damn brilliant and the consequences were so long lasting. </p>

<p> Been in the infosec mines for even a little bit and you&#8217;ll learn that what we all espoused for <i>decades</i> about passwords was wrong. Had I or anyone really thought about people and not the systems we would have realized it was dumb back then. </p>
<p> Orthodoxy is hard to break.</p>
