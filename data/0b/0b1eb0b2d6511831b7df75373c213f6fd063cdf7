JR over at <a href="https://taonaw.com">The Art Of Not Asking Why</a> has a useful post <a href="https://taonaw.com/2026/02/01/org-files-to-beatiful-docx.html">on exporting an Org document to Docx</a>. I&rsquo;ve written about this before [<a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=6828">1</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10911">2</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12773">3</a>] and you might wonder why. After all, you can simply export directly from Org to ODT and get a Word compatible document.
</p>
<p>
The problem occurs when you&rsquo;re working in an environment that requires a specific style implemented with a Word style sheet. The native Org exporter doesn&rsquo;t support this so the usual solution is to use <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>, which <i>does</i> support a Word style sheet.
</p>
<p>
JTR&rsquo;s post has a step-by-step recipe for making the conversion and setting up a Word style sheet using a reference document with the desired settings. He even covers the difficult areas of images and tables, which, of course, require further machinations.

<p>
None of this would be necessary if Word and its siblings would use plain text instead of an arcane, opaque file structure to store the document. After all, it&rsquo;s certainly possible as Org—or, if you require even more complicated output, TeX/LaTeX—show. But, of course, that would stand in the way of editor lock in.

Regardless, if you have to produce Word documents but prefer to write in Org, take a look at JTR&rsquo;s post. He shows you how to produce a good looking Word document from an easy to write Org file. He even shows how to automate the process using Álvaro Ramírez&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command">dwim-shell-command</a>.</p>
