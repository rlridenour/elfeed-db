<p>In the latest escalation of a long-running border dispute, fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces has spread along several stretches of their shared frontier, with both governments accusing each other of firing first and violating a Trump-brokered ceasefire from July and October. Thai authorities report using airstrikes and other military operations to expel what they say are Cambodian troops on Thai soil, while Cambodia says it has launched retaliatory attacks after earlier holding back and warns Thailand not to target civilian villages. Officials and media reports indicate that casualty figures have risen to at least seven civilians killed in Cambodia and three Thai soldiers dead, alongside dozens of wounded, making this the fiercest fighting since a five-day exchange in July that killed dozens overall. The renewed clashes have already pushed well over 100,000 people from their homes in border provinces on both sides, reviving large-scale evacuations to racetracks, temples and other makeshift shelters and raising fears the conflict could deepen if political pressures in both countries override calls for restraint.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8Epj7JNKC8D1Ez8WbCjlNvy6blReP4GZ5h93dmJPhMXC32OylJsyRfbMMlbdX65V-ehdmejxaOZUBo2RRWw01bIoUytyciA-Gm8wo_oUIKCX' alt='Families gather inside a temporary shelter at Chroy Neang Ngourn Pagoda in Siem Reap, Cambodia, after evacuating border areas amid renewed fighting.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ceasefire under strain: The current violence has effectively unraveled a fragile ceasefire that President Trump helped negotiate after July’s five-day conflict, during which US leverage over trade was used to encourage both sides to pause hostilities.</li><li>Border dispute roots: The clashes stem from more than a century of disagreement over undemarcated stretches of the 817-kilometre land border, where claims around ancient temples have repeatedly fueled nationalist sentiment and periodic armed flare-ups.</li><li>Air and artillery use: Thailand has acknowledged carrying out air operations and heavy-weapons fire in frontier areas, while reports from Cambodia describe incoming rocket fire and airstrikes that have hit zones near civilian settlements.</li><li>Mass evacuations setup: Thai authorities have prepared sites such as Buriram’s Chang International Circuit in advance, keeping tents and facilities from July ready because local leaders doubted that previous calm along the frontier would last.</li><li>Domestic political pressures: Analysts interviewed by Al Jazeera warn that internal politics in both Thailand and Cambodia appear to be driving tougher military postures, increasing the risk that the confrontation could enter a more entrenched and protracted phase.</li></ul><blockquote>Domestic politics seems to get the better of the people on both sides. - Kasit Piromya</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Thai government and military: Thailand’s navy and army say Cambodian forces crossed into Thai territory, increased their presence with snipers and heavy weapons, and created fortified positions and trenches that Thailand views as a direct threat to its sovereignty, justifying operations to push them back.
