</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Contributing to the June 2025 #Emacs Carnival.
</p>
        <p>This post is my contribution to the <a href="https://christiantietze.de/posts/2025/06/emacs-carnival-2025-06-take-two/">Emacs Carnival 2025-06: Take Two</a>.  With a
sign-up list on the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Carnival">Carnival page of the EmacsWiki</a>.</p>
<p>In <time datetime="2020-05" title="2020-05">May 2020</time> I used <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
 for the second time…the time that it stuck.  The first
time was in <time datetime="2005-09" title="2005-09">September 2005</time>.  I was transitioning from a Microsoft and <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">International Business Machines Corporation</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “International Business Machines Corporation”" title="Other site-wide references of “International Business Machines Corporation”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-IBM">&#128214;</a></small>
 shop
to a <span><a href="https://linux.org/">Linux</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Linux”" title="Other site-wide references of “Linux”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-LINUX">&#128214;</a></small>
 shop.  At the previous job, I used the tools offered: a green screen
text editor for <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG">Report Program Generator programming language from IBM</a></span> (<abbr title="Report Program Generator programming language from IBM">IBM RPG</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Report Program Generator programming language from IBM”" title="Other site-wide references of “Report Program Generator programming language from IBM”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-RPGP">&#128214;</a></small>)
, Microsoft Access/Visual Basic, and Plex (a case tool
allowed multiple inheritance and could build either C or <abbr title="Report Program Generator programming language from IBM">IBM RPG</abbr>
) programs.</p>
<p>I’ve thought a lot, though never all that deep, about that decision to set <span>Emacs</span>

aside.  And wonder at that moment in <time datetime="2005" title="2005">2005</time> had I chosen to adopt <span>Emacs</span>
; what
might that path have been?  For a few months after stepping away from <span>Emacs</span>
 I
used <span><a href="http://www.jedit.org">JEdit</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “JEdit”" title="Other site-wide references of “JEdit”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-JEDIT">&#128214;</a></small>
.  Then switched to <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextMate">Textmate</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Textmate”" title="Other site-wide references of “Textmate”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-TEXTMATE">&#128214;</a></small>
 in <time datetime="2006-01" title="2006-01">January 2006</time>, in large part because
that was the <em>de facto</em> editor of <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails">Ruby on Rails</a></span> (<abbr title="Ruby on Rails">Rails</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Ruby on Rails”" title="Other site-wide references of “Ruby on Rails”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-ROR">&#128214;</a></small>)
.</p>
<p>What would’ve made the then <span>Emacs</span>
 sticky enough for me to use?  I was then in
the process of learning <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP Programming Language</a></span> (<abbr title="PHP Programming Language">PHP</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “PHP Programming Language”" title="Other site-wide references of “PHP Programming Language”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-PHP">&#128214;</a></small>)
 and pre-Prototype Ajax calls.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> Before jQuery there was Prototype and before that an even hotter mess.  I
remember adopting Rico.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
 At home, I was
using Lotus Notes to model data for <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">Role Playing Games</a></span> (<abbr title="Role Playing Games">RPGs</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Role Playing Games”" title="Other site-wide references of “Role Playing Games”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-RPG">&#128214;</a></small>)
.</p>
<p>Why Lotus Notes?  It was the tool I had and knew.  Further, the database and
data were all in one file that I could use.  A portability.  Contrast with work,
where I was dipping into the realm of <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL">Postgresql</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Postgresql”" title="Other site-wide references of “Postgresql”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-POSTGRESQL">&#128214;</a></small>
 and MySQL.</p>
<p>Standing and running those locally was not quite something I wanted to pursue;
and for my hobby I would’ve also needed an application.  The person who nudged
me to consider <span>Emacs</span>
 was also writing <abbr title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr>
 tools, but was choosing to write in
Python.  Had they said “I’m writing this all in <span>Emacs</span>
”, I think I would’ve
listened a bit more.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the following decade or so, I abandoned that Lotus Notes project;
it worked well enough but I was losing access to the license to run it.  I was
on the path to making various <abbr title="Ruby on Rails">Rails</abbr>
 applications.  So I spent time migrating
that Lotus Notes application to a <abbr title="Ruby on Rails">Rails</abbr>
 application.  But I abandoned that
application and started up several successors; all abandoned.</p>
<p>For these personal projects, nothing quite stuck.  Things came close in <a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/gm-notepad">my
gm-notepad: A command-line tool to help with your GM-ing.</a>  Started before I
switched to <span>Emacs</span>
, it was a <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">Read-eval-print loop</a></span> (<abbr title="Read-eval-print loop">REPL</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Read-eval-print loop”" title="Other site-wide references of “Read-eval-print loop”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-REPL">&#128214;</a></small>)
 environment that could be used for note taking
while running a game.  And generating results from random tables (that could be
created on the fly).</p>
<p>You can read about <code>gm-notepad</code> in 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2019/07/26/introducing-gm-notepad-a-command-line-tool-for-gm-ing/">Introducing GM Notepad: A Command Line Tool for GM-ing</a></cite>.</p>
<p>Had I been using <span>Emacs</span>
 just enough before <abbr title="Ruby on Rails">Rails</abbr>
, what would’ve kept me from
later jumping to <span>Textmate</span>
?</p>
<p>I would’ve had about four months to acclimate to <span>Emacs</span>
.  And in that time I
would’ve needed to see the potential of a <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Lisp”" title="Other site-wide references of “Lisp”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-LISP">&#128214;</a></small>
 machine; namely its <abbr title="Read-eval-print loop">REPL</abbr>
 and how
I might be able to model that Lotus Notes application in <span>Emacs</span>
.  That was a
likely crease.</p>
<p>Looking to the switch that stuck, from the <time datetime="2020-05-24" title="2020-05-24">end of May 2020</time> to the <a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs/blob/776439af133e4d5f945dfb704d3d05ba7432a10b">four months
later my Emacs config</a> I made 231 commits into my <span>Emacs</span>
 configuration.  During
that time I had accumulated/created 3200 lines of Lisp.  Granted, that 4 month
window was one in which I had minimal job responsibilities and no social
engagements; meaning lots of time for exploration.</p>
<p>Contrast with the time frame <time datetime="2005-09" title="2005-09">September 2005</time> to <time datetime="2005-12" title="2005-12">December 2005</time>, in which my
children were quite young.  We were also hosting twice a week events at our
house and a full-time job that was very much new to me.</p>
<p>My available time would’ve been different.</p>
<p>I’m also unclear how I would’ve managed packages.  And what packages were
available?  The baseline Emacs, with tutorial, is quite robust.  The features of
bare <span>Emacs</span>
 were “competitive” with my understanding of what I needed in a text
editor.</p>
<p>I don’t know what Emacs 22 of <time datetime="2005" title="2005">2005</time> would’ve felt like compared to me joining
around Emacs 27.  How many <code>init.el</code> bankruptcies might I have declared in those
two decades?</p>
<p>Factors that might have helped:</p>
<p>First, learning about <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a></span> (<abbr title="Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs">SICP</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-STRUCTURE-AND-INTERPRETATION-OF-COMPUTER-PROGRAMS">&#128214;</a></small>)
 during that time.  While I haven’t read <abbr title="Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs">SICP</abbr>
, knowing
then that it described concepts in Scheme, a <span>Lisp</span>
 dialect, I might have pursued
reading it.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> I don’t feel the same compulsion now to read it as I would’ve then.  But
maybe I should seek out a print copy.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
  I learned about it one year later, in <time datetime="2006" title="2006">2006</time>.</p>
<p>Second, stumbling upon the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/">EmacsWiki</a>, mailing list, and <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">Internet Relay Chat</a></span> (<abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Internet Relay Chat”" title="Other site-wide references of “Internet Relay Chat”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-INTERNET-RELAY-CHAT">&#128214;</a></small>)
.  That is finding
the places where folks were troubleshooting their <span>Emacs</span>
 problems but also
exploring how to extend <span>Emacs</span>
.</p>
<p>Third, learning of Alex Schroeder, both involved in <abbr title="Role Playing Games">RPGs</abbr>
 and <span>Emacs</span>
, may have
helped.  That is finding just enough folks at the intersection of two aspects of
my then (and current) interests.  There are a few others.</p>
<p>I’m wondering how a younger me would’ve handled being a few months into <span>Emacs</span>

and then seeing the flashy <span>Textmate</span>
.  Would that time with <span>Emacs</span>
 have been
sticky enough to keep with it?  And had I chosen <span>Textmate</span>
, when it soured, would
I have considered a return to <span>Emacs</span>
?  Or would <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text">Sublime Text</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Sublime Text”" title="Other site-wide references of “Sublime Text”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-SUBLIME">&#128214;</a></small>
 win out?  What of
<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor)">Atom</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Atom”" title="Other site-wide references of “Atom”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-ATOM">&#128214;</a></small>
?</p>
<p>It took me attending the funeral of three text editors to finally wake and pick
<span>Emacs</span>
; but even then only after exploring <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">Visual Studio Code</a></span> (<abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VS Code</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Visual Studio Code”" title="Other site-wide references of “Visual Studio Code”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-VSC">&#128214;</a></small>)
 and again saying “nope” to
<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Vim”" title="Other site-wide references of “Vim”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-VIM">&#128214;</a></small>
.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> I can use <span>Vim</span>
just well enough to favor it over something like Nano.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>Adopting <span>Emacs</span>
 took me knowing the baseline of what I wanted from my editor and
a prior memory of <span>Emacs</span>
.</p>
<p>Would I know that without the years of practice?  It also took experiencing
skill obsolescence; each bit of learning how to extend an editor is useful but
the specifics are often non-transferable.</p>
<p>Would I have the wisdom to pierce the veil of first <span>Textmate</span>
 then <span>Sublime Text</span>

then <span>Atom</span>
?  And see that by construction and design they would only be able to
be a narrower subset of <span>Emacs</span>
’s capability?  Could I have seen past the gloss
and chrome?</p>
<p>Would I have considered the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy Effect</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Lindy Effect”" title="Other site-wide references of “Lindy Effect”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-LINDY-EFFECT">&#128214;</a></small>
?  Or understood the potential of the
cumulative effect of my editor?  Moving away from one editor has meant leaving
behind knowledge of its configuration and extension; each their own foibles.</p>
<p>Would I have been able to see the difference of extending <span>Emacs</span>
 versus extending
<span>Textmate</span>
?  <span>Emacs</span>
 hits different than <span>Textmate</span>
, <span>Sublime Text</span>
, and <span>Atom</span>
.  Where
<span>Emacs</span>
’s currency is buffers, lists, and functions; the others had
hard-boundaries and <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">Application Programming Interfaces</a></span> (<abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Application Programming Interfaces”" title="Other site-wide references of “Application Programming Interfaces”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-API">&#128214;</a></small>)
.</p>
<p>About a year before leaving <span>Atom</span>
, I set about writing an extension.  My memory
is that it was hellish process; and more than just needing to create two almost
duplicate chunks of code/data to make much of anything happen.</p>
<p>Contrast <span>Emacs</span>
, where extending is assumed, encouraged, consistent, and
facilitated by powerful introspection.  I’ve learned a lot by reading <span>Emacs</span>

commands, seeing what they compose and choosing one of those “inner” functions
from which to build.</p>
<p>That hits different than reading an editor’s extension <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
, which is the
implementation teams means of stating “this is how you are allowed to
change this program.”</p>
<p>I’ve also thought recently about <a href="https://writingslowly.com/2025/05/03/i-found-a-way-to.html">I found a way to create order from my jumbled
ideas</a>.  I use Emacs to think as well as help recall those thoughts.  The
functions I’ve written are a mix of help me write and help me find what I wrote.</p>
<p>Those functions provide breadcrumbs for further extensions; with the
thought being that I’m most likely to extend/enhance functionality adjacent to
or overlapping with a concept I’ve already “touched.”</p>
