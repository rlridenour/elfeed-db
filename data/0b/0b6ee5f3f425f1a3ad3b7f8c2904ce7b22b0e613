<p>You know how &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always DNS?&rdquo; In Linux, I think it should be &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always permissions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I tried to back up my new Kubuntu setup with the built-in backup program, which seems to be up to the task. It&rsquo;s nice, clean and minimal (the actual name, by the way, is <a href="https://apps.kde.org/kup/">Kup</a>, but they don&rsquo;t tell you that;  when you look for &ldquo;KDE backup&rdquo; or something similar, you get confused with <a href="https://apps.kde.org/kbackup/">Kbackup</a>, which is a different program).</p>
<p>When I finished setting it up, using my external drive as a backup target, It just sat there telling me the backup program never ran. &ldquo;OK, yes,&rdquo; I told it, &ldquo;I get that, so, start? where&rsquo;s the button&hellip; how do I start you?&rdquo; I burned some good coffee trying to figure this out.</p>
<p>Kup is configured to prompt the user automatically when everything is ready for the backup task. If something is wrong, well, it will not say anything; it will just wait for you to get things ready.</p>
<p>After a lot of back and forth, I realized that even though I asked my external hard drive to be accessible to all users, in practice, it wasn&rsquo;t. Only root had access. The solution was to create a folder on the external and change its owner to my user (with good old <code>chown</code>). As soon as I did that, Kup (AKA &ldquo;Backups) happily nagged me, &ldquo;Hey, you want to back up your stuff?&rdquo; And now it&rsquo;s finally doing the thing. So yeah. Permissions.</p>
