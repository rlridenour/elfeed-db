<p>Five-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, have returned to their home in a Minneapolis suburb after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and held at a Texas detention facility. Their release followed a federal judge’s order, after roughly 10 days in custody, allowing the family to reunite at home. A Texas Democrat, Representative Joaquin Castro, said he accompanied the pair from Texas back to Minnesota, drawing attention to the case as it spread widely online and prompted public criticism. The judge sharply faulted the government’s handling, with outlets reporting the ruling used unusually blunt language about detaining a small child, intensifying scrutiny of immigration enforcement practices under President Trump’s administration.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/mTasjvKkPcGkkklHJi_9yrzncoVB67aMdSajiGq7ZKASgCSbBIzPsMFFffrZXFI2LKTscIGvyBCrKsjvglt8BvyRb0gWwRdZqtyDbFNdOvIVa1ORSX62UBl9mIeal1a1GHkWxX0Z8YALLtGXdRkvlVc7uryyRZCXxtaTJNmYYpnMUhmX-yHufV6EVpqdshX8oVoEWVYJPboPQZPMRFgnt6-bsjAL2dXWMG9hMl70AlRlAJY7biiBIdIwuyyPf_bhZtOuXeCG1RG7dSzAHA' alt='Liam Conejo Ramos, 5, is detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers after arriving home from preschool in a Minneapolis suburb, Jan. 20, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Asylum status: Multiple outlets reported Liam is an Ecuadorean child and that he and his father entered the United States legally as asylum applicants, a detail that became central to public reaction.</li><li>Raid circumstances: The detention occurred during a Minnesota raid in a Minneapolis suburb, with several reports noting the pair were later transferred to a facility in Dilley, Texas.</li><li>Judge’s critique: U.S. District Judge Fred Biery wrote that the case stemmed from an &quot;ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented&quot; government action, according to coverage summarizing his ruling.</li><li>Public attention: Images circulated showing Liam in a bunny hat surrounded by immigration officers, which news reports said fueled outrage and helped elevate the case nationally.</li><li>Policy debate: Le Monde reported the judge criticized what he described as the administration’s focus on &quot;daily deportation quotas,&quot; arguing it risked traumatizing children.</li></ul><blockquote>Cruel&quot; and &quot;bereft of human decency - U.S. District Judge Fred Biery</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Rep.
