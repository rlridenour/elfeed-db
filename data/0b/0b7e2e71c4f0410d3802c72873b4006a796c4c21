Electronics repair website <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/">iFixit</a> today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOldOvlzjr0">teardown video</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-debuts-new-ipad-pro-with-m5/">iPad Pro with the M5 chip</a>, revealing a "repair paradox."<br/>

Specifically, iFixit said the iPad Pro remains one of Apple's least-repairable devices, yet the company did <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-launches-self-service-repair-for-ipad/">start offering self-service repair parts and manuals for iPads</a> earlier this year. As a result of the self-service expansion, iFixit gave the latest iPad Pro a provisional repairability score of 5/10, which is higher than previous models.<br/>
<br/>
Given the iPad Pro only received a spec-bump with the M5 chip, the teardown video does not reveal any notable internal changes.<br/>

The new iPad Pro launched last week, and Apple should release self-service parts for this particular model in the coming months.<br/>
