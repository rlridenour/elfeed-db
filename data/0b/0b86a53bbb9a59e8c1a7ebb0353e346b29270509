The seventh developer betas of iOS 26 and watchOS 26 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/ios-26-watchos-26-beta-7-redesigned-blood-oxygen/">include a redesigned Blood Oxygen feature</a> on Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models sold in the U.S. since mid-January 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Adaptive Power Notifications</h2><br/>

iOS 26 introduces an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/21/ios-26-adaptive-power-mode-compatible-iphones/">Adaptive Power Mode</a> on the iPhone, alongside the existing Low Power Mode.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says Adaptive Power Mode can make "performance adjustments" when necessary to extend an iPhone's battery life, including slightly lowering the display brightness, allowing some activities to "take longer," and automatically turning on Low Power Mode when the iPhone's remaining battery life reaches the 20% mark.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 beta 7 adds an additional Adaptive Power Notifications toggle in the Settings app, under Battery → Power Mode. This setting allows you to choose whether you receive push notifications each time Adaptive Power mode kicks in.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 is compatible with the iPhone 11 series and newer, but Adaptive Power Mode is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro models and newer.<br/>
