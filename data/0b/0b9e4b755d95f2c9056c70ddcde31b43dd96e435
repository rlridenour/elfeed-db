<p>I wrote <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2025/12/security-updates-in-apples-26-2-updates/">earlier this week</a> about the important security updates Apple just rolled out in its 26.2 operating system updates. Among the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125884">security fixes</a> are <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/apple-patches-two-zero-days-tied-to-mysterious-exploited-chrome-flaw/">two zero-day bugs</a> affecting WebKit, the browser engine that drives Safari. According to Apple, “this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.”</p>
<p>Pretty serious. There are also many other security fixes, including (as I mentioned) a <a href="https://x.com/rosyna/status/1999651923277090923">major Messages privacy leak</a>. When a serious security update comes out, users should update. It’s just the smart move.</p>
<p>Apple generally tries not to leave behind users who haven’t updated or can’t update to the latest OS version. Apple also usually offers security updates for past OS versions, and indeed, the company also released <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125885">iOS 18.7.3</a> to address the same issues.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s an ugly catch: Numerous iPhone users have reported that if your iPhone is <em>capable</em> of running iOS 26 but you’re still back on iOS 18, you won’t be offered iOS 18.7.3. Instead, the only update option you’ll be given is iOS 26.2.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to avoid updating to iOS 26, from a dislike of Liquid Glass to software compatibility to a general wariness to install major updates for a while. This move <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/256211483?sortBy=rank">effectively forces</a> users to take the iOS 26 upgrade if they want the security updates. (iPhones not capable of running iOS 26 are offered the 18.7.3 update. iPads seem to be unaffected.)</p>
<p>This isn’t great. Apple shouldn’t be withholding a security update from people not willing to upgrade to the next OS version. I don’t know if this is an error, bug, or policy decision, and as of this writing, Apple hasn’t responded to my questions about this issue.</p>
<p>Several users have reported to me that a workaround is to sign up for Apple’s <a href="https://beta.apple.com">public beta program</a> and opt in to the iOS 18 public beta track, at which point you’ll be offered 18.7.3. Seems like a long way to go just to get security fixes.</p>
<p>In general, Apple is very good about supplying security updates to older operating systems, so all its users can stay protected. But in cases like this, users should never be forced to choose between ignoring a security update and updating to an OS version they’re not ready for.</p>
