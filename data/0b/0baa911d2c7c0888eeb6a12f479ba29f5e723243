<blockquote>
  <p>Production orders for the iPhone Air have been cut nearly to “end
of production” levels, despite it only becoming available in China
last week, due to weak demand in other markets, multiple sources
briefed on the matter said.</p>

<p>Under the initial production plan, the iPhone Air accounted for
roughly 10% to 15% of overall new iPhone production this year,
said two sources familiar with the plan. The model is seen as
strategically paving the way for the first foldable iPhone,
expected to debut in 2026, three people with knowledge of the
matter said. Nikkei Asia earlier reported that Apple has high
hopes for the launch of such a phone next year.</p>

<p>Apple has told multiple suppliers to largely reduce component and
electronics module orders for the iPhone Air, two people with
direct knowledge of the situation said. One supply chain manager
said production orders for the iPhone Air from November onward
will be less than 10% of the volume compared with September.
Another supplier executive said they received a similar notice
from Apple. [...]</p>

<p>By contrast, demand for the iPhone 17 model and iPhone 17 Pro has
exceeded expectations. Apple has increased production orders for
the baseline iPhone 17 by about 5 million units and also added
orders for the high-end iPhone 17 Pro, according to two sources
with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>

<p>I don’t understand the argument that the iPhone Air “paves the way” for a foldable iPhone next year. Either the iPhone Air is a desirable iPhone that can stand on its own or it isn’t. I firmly believe it is. Apple obviously did too. If they didn’t they wouldn’t have shipped it. There was no reason to ship the iPhone Air “in preparation” for a foldable iPhone next year if they didn’t think the Air would be a success on its own. They could have just started with the foldable next year.</p>

<p>One thing that’s weird about these reports of low sales numbers for the iPhone Air is that it doesn’t seem like Apple is advertising it at all. If I were Joz, I’d be advertising the hell out of it. I’ve been watching a lot of sports on commercial TV since September, and I haven’t seen a single ad for the Air. Tons of commercials and billboards for the orange iPhone 17 Pro, <a href="https://www.threads.com/@thebasicappleguy/post/DQRyfheCYAW">but zip for the Air</a>.</p>

<p>Also, as <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/20/counterpoint-research-iphones-17">I just wrote Monday</a> and have repeated oft before, take these numbers with huge grains of salt. Whether the numbers are from “research firms” or supply chain sources, they’re not from Apple, and sales numbers that aren’t from Apple have <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/02/claim-chowder-kuo-iphones-16">often proved to be way wrong</a>.</p>
