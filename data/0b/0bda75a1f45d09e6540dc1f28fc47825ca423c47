Álvaro Ramírez has a new <a href="https://xenodium.com/bending-emacs-episode-10-agent-shell">Bending Emacs video</a> up. This time it&rsquo;s about his <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell">agent-shell</a> app that serves as uniform Emacs interface to LLM agents supporting the <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/introduction">Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</a>.

I&rsquo;m not interested in LLM technology so you almost never see an Irreal post about it. I don&rsquo;t know—and therefore have no opinion on—if it&rsquo;s something real or just another venture capitalist fever dream. Still, if you <i>are</i> interested in LLMs, it&rsquo;s nice to have an app like agent-shell that provides a uniform interface to most (all?) of them.

There&rsquo;s a huge number of options and details to negotiate so an app like agent-shell is a real boon. Almost none of those options involve picking which shell you want to use. You simply choose one from a list of supported shells and work within that shell for the rest of your session.

There are <i>way</i> too many details for me to cover here. The video itself is 36 minutes, 34 seconds so there&rsquo;s a lot of content to cover. If you are interested in LLMs, and especially if you use more than one, you should definitely watch this video and download agent-shell. It&rsquo;s available on Melpa so installation is easy. Like all of Ramírez&rsquo;s work, agent-shell seems like a well engineered app and it&rsquo;s free so you have nothing to lose by trying it.</p>
