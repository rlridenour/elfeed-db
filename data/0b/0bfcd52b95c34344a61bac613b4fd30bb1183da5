<p>Kyle Orland, reporting for Ars Technica last week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vox Media has sold video game specialist website Polygon to
<a href="https://www.valnetinc.com/our-brands">Internet brand aggregator Valnet</a>, the publisher of
content-churning sites including Game Rant, OpenCritic, Android
Police, and Comic Book Resources. The move comes alongside
significant layoffs for veteran journalists at the 13-year-old
outlet, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26">co-founder and editor-in-chief Chris
Plante</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mmcwhertor.bsky.social/post/3lo4lsc3pqk2c">Senior Writer Michael McWhertor</a>. [...]</p>

<p>Polygon was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/polygon-com-its-a-website.1185405/">founded in 2012</a> when Vox Media <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/10/24/the-inside-story-of-polygon-the-verges-new-gaming-sister-site/">spent
significant money</a> to poach top journalists from popular
gaming blogs like Kotaku, Joystiq, and The Escapist. After
initially publishing as the Gaming section of Vox.com for a few
months, the Polygon domain <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/24/3547938/welcome-to-polygon">launched</a> alongside <a href="https://botherer.org/2012/08/23/polygon-and-the-documentary-that-cured-cancer/">a series
of flashy videos</a> hyping up the staff’s lofty goals for
video game journalism. In the years since, Polygon has become a
respected source for news and views on the gaming and
entertainment industries — one that Ars Technica has cited
frequently during my tenure as senior gaming editor. [...]</p>

<p>According to publications like <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">The Wrap</a> and
<a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates">Aftermath</a>, numerous Valnet writers have claimed that they
receive low pay for long articles, but Valnet insists that working
conditions are good. It even sued The Wrap in federal court,
saying that Valnet “relies on its reputation as a supporter of
high-quality journalism and of talented writers and editors to
staff its ever-growing business and need for engaging and
well-written content.”</p>

<p>Just brutal. I’m not huge into games, but Polygon has been one of my go-to sources for game-related news for years. If I wanted to catch up on something like, say, Nintendo’s Switch 2 announcements, I knew I could go to Polygon and they’d have the coverage nailed. Polygon was everything you could want: good writing, good design, no hype, trustworthy coverage and analysis.</p>

<p>There’s very little good news in media these days. The only talented people I see launching new things are doing it on Substack, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack">I think that’s going to end poorly</a> for all of them.</p>
