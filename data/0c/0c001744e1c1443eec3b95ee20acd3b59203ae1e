    Gave a demonstration of EShell to both the PDX and London Emacs
    User groups.  While the recording may be fun to watch, feedback
    told me that the white rabbit holes I dived into were interesting,
    a <a href="Technical/Emacs/eshell-present.html">transcript of the slides and demonstration</a> may be easier to
    copy/paste.
