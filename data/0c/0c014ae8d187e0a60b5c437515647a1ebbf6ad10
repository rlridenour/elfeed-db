<p>On Monday, Apple&#8217;s going to announce its new user interface redesign for all of its platforms. There are so many rumors around this now, and it seems inevitable. Several folks have asked me if I think that it&#8217;s going to be like the hot mess we had back in the iOS 7 days. I don&#8217;t think so.</p>



<p>When Apple first announced and released the flat design of iOS 7, it was a hellish beta. Some of the initial font choices were unreadable to me, and over the course of the beta period, they pulled back from the original aggressive design. What folks forget, though, is that iOS 7 was a rushed redesign. Shortly before, Scott Forstall had been fired from the company, and Jony Ive had been given control of software.</p>



<p>The iOS 7 look came from Jony, and the Apple engineers did not have much time to implement it. As such, not only was the beta period difficult, but the iOS 7 launch was difficult. When they publicly released iOS 7, many people still had bugs and problems with their phones, so much so that to this day, I know people who will not automatically install Apple updates anymore because of iOS 7.</p>



<p>The upcoming redesign is not, and does not feel like, something that Apple is rushing out the door. Indeed, I thought we might get this last year. Apple spent years developing this new look with the Vision Pro, and it really seemed natural that this new look would be coming to the rest of Apple&#8217;s platforms.</p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t a last-minute decision because they&#8217;re behind on artificial intelligence. If anything, it&#8217;s a delayed release of a user interface they&#8217;ve been working on for years. I could be entirely wrong about this. I don&#8217;t have any inside information, but if I had to bet a nickel, I&#8217;d say that, despite the fact they&#8217;re making significant changes to the user interface across the board, this will be nothing like the iOS 7 days.</p>
