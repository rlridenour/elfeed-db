<p>In 2020, three researchers from UT Austin and Lancaster University examined 40,000 fictional narratives and discovered a consistent linguistic pattern. Articles and prepositions such as <em>a</em> and <em>the</em> are common at the start of a story, where they set the stage by providing information about people, places, and things. As the plot progresses, auxiliary verbs, adverbs, and pronouns become more common &#8212; words that are action-oriented and social. Near the end, &#8220;cognitive tension words&#8221; such as <em>think</em>, <em>realize</em>, and <em>because</em> become more common, words that reflect people trying to make sense of their world.</p>
<p>These patterns are consistent across novels, short stories, and amateur (&#8220;off-the-cuff&#8221;) stories. &#8220;If we want to connect with an audience, we have to appreciate what information they need, but don&#8217;t yet have,&#8221; <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2020/08/07/authors-invisible-words-reveal-blueprint-for-storytelling/">said lead author Ryan Boyd</a>. &#8220;At the most fundamental level, humans need a flood of &#8216;logic language&#8217; at the beginning of a story to make sense of it, followed by a rising stream of &#8216;action&#8217; information to convey the actual plot of the story.&#8221;</p>
