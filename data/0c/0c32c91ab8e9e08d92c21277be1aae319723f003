</><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Thinking through further reasons why I&rsquo;m less and less likely to use #AI (aka an #LLM).
</p>
        <p>I was reading <a href="https://200ok.ch/posts/2025-05-23_sandboxing_ai_tools:_how_guix_containers_keep_your_host_safe_while_empowering_llms.html">200ok: Sandboxing AI Tools: How Guix Containers Keep Your Host
Safe While Empowering LLMs</a> and their opening passage struck me; I re-read it in
the voice of those “You wouldn’t steal a car would you?” commercials from the
music industry.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

suggests running some shell commands or manipulating files. It&rsquo;s incredibly
productive—until that nagging voice in your head whispers, &ldquo;What if this goes
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there. AI tools with filesystem and command execution
capabilities are absolute game-changers for productivity, but handing over the
keys to your entire system? That&rsquo;s a hard pass for any security-conscious
developer.</p>


</blockquote>

<p>First, I can’t picture it.  I rarely use an <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>
.  It is absolutely not an
integrated part of my work—I don’t need some roid-raging Clippy brow beating me
with constant revisions nor teasing me with short-cuts that cobble together a
Frankenstein’s monster.</p>
<p>Second, “handing over keys to your entire system?”  Yes that is a hard pass.  I
see <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>
 (as presented) as handing over keys to a superset of the system implied
by the original poster; namely the system of skill development.</p>
<p>I think to the hierarchy of survival in an emergency: tools are the most
important, then skills, then relationships.  However, once an emergency abates,
the order flips: relationships being the most important, then skills, and
finally tools.</p>
<p>I see <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>
 (as presented) as a tool…that you lease/rent; one that comes loaded
with an agenda of its creator(s).  And looking to that order outside of an
emergency, replacing skill development and usage with using a leased non-neutral
tool creates a precarity I’m not prepared to accept for myself.</p>
<p>Getting better and more dependent on a leased/rented tool makes little sense,
unless I’m prepared to cede my means of production to the owner of that tool.</p>
