<p>By philosopher Steven M. Cahn:</p>
<blockquote><p>
(1) Assume that there exists an omnipotent, omniscient, omnimalevolent Demon who created the world.<br />
(2) If the Demon exists, then there would be no goodness in the world.<br />
(3) But there is goodness in the world.<br />
(4) Therefore, the Demon does not exist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A demonist who wants to deny (4) would need to deny (1), (2), or (3). No demonist would question (1), and it&#8217;s difficult to deny (3), but we can escape (2) only by claiming that the world&#8217;s good is somehow necessary, that every good in the world is logically needed in order for this to be the worst world that the Demon could have created.</p>
<p>This is the familiar &#8220;problem of evil&#8221; turned on its head. The notion that all the world&#8217;s good (sunsets, Socrates&#8217; free will) is necessary to create maximum evil is just as improbable as that all the world&#8217;s evil (bubonic plague, Hitler&#8217;s free will) is needed to create maximum good. Unless demonists or theists can produce further evidence in favor of their positions, &#8220;the reasonable conclusion is that neither the Demon nor God exists.&#8221;</p>
