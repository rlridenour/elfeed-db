A considerable amount of research has been devoted to establishing a relationship between strategic management and business performance. The spectrum of conclusions ranges from strong positive correlations to claims that the role of formal planning systems in business management is only informational (Rogers, Miller &amp; Judge 1999, 567–568). Hill, Jones &amp; Galvin (2004, 23) take a position in this debate by claiming that &#34;strategic planning, on average, has a positive impact on company performance&#34;.</p>
<p>
This claim further referred to as the &#39;Performance Claim&#39;, is based on research conducted by Miller &amp; Cardinal (1994) and Rogers et al. (1999). Many academics question the usefulness of formal strategic planning systems as a means to improve company performance and argue that <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/strategic-management-and-serendipity/">serendipity</a> plays a critical role in determining competitive advantage (Mintzberg 1979, Hart 1992, Hamel 1996).</p>
<p>
This essay evaluates the claim that strategic planning has a positive influence on company performance. This paper argues that an organisation can not rely solely on formal systems to develop a corporate strategy. Although empirical research points towards a positive correlation between strategic planning and company performance, these studies suffer from some methodological problems.</p>
<p>
It will further be argued that because strategic management is not an exact science, strategy formulation requires a great deal of intuition and company performance relies to some extent on serendipity. This finding does, however, not imply that strategic planning as a formal exercise is futile. Strategic planning is vital for excellent management of an organisation. Not as a means to plot the course for years ahead, but as a way to be able to anticipate the unpredictability of external influences.</p>
<p>
In the next section of this essay, the terms of the performance claim will be clarified. Following a discussion of research supporting and rejecting the Performance Claim, the different viewpoints are analysed and, an integrated approach to strategic planning will be proposed.</p>

Strategic Management and Business Performance
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The Performance Claim (Strategic planning, on average, has a positive impact on company performance) has two terms that need clarification before it can be assessed: strategic planning and company performance.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-2">
What is strategic planning?
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Hill et al. (2004, 5) define strategy regarding its function as: &#34;an
action a company takes to attain superior performance&#34;. Functional
definitions are, however, not suitable to assess the Performance Claim.
When a strategy is defined as the action(s) taken to improve
performance, the claim that strategy enhances performance becomes a
tautology (Actions taken to attain superior performance, on average,
have a positive impact on company performance). A different kind of
definition is required to assess the Performance Claim.</p>
<p>
Mintzberg (1979, 11) argued that strategic planning is a multifaceted
phenomenon which is impossible to define in a short essential
definition. He rejects any interpretation of strategy that restricts it
to explicit, a priori guidelines and expands restrictive definitions by
including evolved, a posteriori, consistencies in decisional behaviour
as a strategy. Mintzberg advocates a phenomenological approach and
defines strategy as a &#34;plan, ploy, pattern, position and perspective&#34;
(Mintzberg 1987).</p>
<p>
The multifaceted approach of Mintzberg is more suitable to assess the
Performance Claim because it explains what strategic management is or
can be, not what it is intended to do. Strategic planning is the formal
process, or set of processes used to determine the strategies (actions)
of the organisation (Hill et al. 2004, 5). Not all strategy is, however,
derived from a formalised process. Hill et al. (2004, 23) distinguish,
following Mintzberg, between intended strategy and emergent strategy. In
intended strategy—the formal strategic planning process—strategic
choices are based on rigorous analysis of external and internal factors.</p>
<p>
Emergent strategies, on the other hand, originate from organisational
grassroots. Emergent strategies are not developed but evolve in an
organisation through actions that the organisation takes in reaction to
internal and external circumstances (Hill et al. 2004, 20). The
discourse around the Performance Claim focuses on the impact on the
performance of strategic planning as a formalised process. In this
essay, the Performance Claim will be evaluated from both perspectives.</p>

Company performance
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Company performance is traditionally related to increasing shareholder
value. Performance can, however, also be measured regarding reduction of
environmental footprint, improved occupational health and safety
performance, increased customer satisfaction and so on. All research
referred to in this essay uses the restricted interpretation of company
performance, e.g. financial performance.</p>
<p>
A key term in the Performance Claim is that company performance is on
average positively affected by formal strategic planning. The research
referred to in this essay (Miller &amp; Cardinal 1994, Rogers et al. 1999)
investigated whether a positive correlation between the amount of
strategic planning and company performance exists; the more formal
strategic planning, the better a company will perform.</p>

The Performance Claim
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The Performance Claim states that there exists a positive correlation
between the extent of formal strategic planning and financial company
performance.</p>
<p>
Miller &amp; Cardinal (1994) argue that strategic planning positively
influences financial performance of an organisation. They investigated
how firm size, capital intensity and environmental turbulence influence
performance in firms with different degrees of formal strategic
planning. The authors concluded that the mean correlations support the
thesis that planning positively affects growth and profitability. The
correlations show a fairly large fluctuation (\(0.30 &lt; r^{2} &lt; 0.71\)), but
are skewed towards positive performance. They also concluded that
stronger planning-profitability correlations emerge when firms face
turbulent environments (Miller &amp; Vaughan 2001, 1658).</p>
<p>
Rogers et al. (1999) argued that a direct link between strategic
planning and performance could not be made without considering the
moderating effect of the actual content of the strategy. They
investigated whether the relationship between strategic planning
processes and organisational performance depends on the content of the
strategy pursued and not just the extent of planning. Strategic planning
was measured by using a questionnaire completed by representatives of
several banks, which resulted in a set of planning dimensions:
accounting control, integration &amp; coordination, flexibility, goals &amp;
plans, scanning and broad analysis. When the data was controlled to
include strategy content, it was found that strategy content moderates
the relationship between planning and performance. The overall
conclusion of their research was that formal strategic planning
positively influences company performance, as expressed in the
Performance Claim.</p>
<p>
Mankins &amp; Steele (2005) support the Performance Claim but argue that
companies typically only realise 63% of the potential value of their
strategy because of defects in planning and execution. Mankins and
Steele provide a list of causes of performance loss but do not recognise
that contingencies can negatively influence company performance. They
thus imply that any strategy can be realised, as long as planned and
executed appropriately.</p>

<h3 id="headline-5">
Emergent Strategy and company performance
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Several researchers emphasise the importance of emergent strategy
formulation and downplay the role of formal strategic planning. They
argue that luck plays a critical role in whether an organisation is
successful or not (Mintzberg 1979, Hart 1992, Hamel 1996).</p>
<p>
Strategy formation is, according to Mintzberg, the interplay between the
formal, intended strategies and informal, emergent strategies, mediated
by leadership (Mintzberg 1979, 72). He emphasises that strategy is not a
fixed plan, nor does it change systematically at prearranged times at
the will of management (Mintzberg 1979, 84). Mintzberg emphasises the
unpredictability of the external environment. An organisation can find
itself in a stable environment for long periods of time, without the
need to change its strategy. Sometimes the environment can, however,
become so turbulent that even the best planning techniques are useless
because of the high level of unpredictability (Mintzberg 1979, 75). This
seems to contradict the finding of Rogers et al. (1999) that stronger
planning-profitability correlations emerge when firms face turbulent
environments. Companies that perform well in a chaotic environment
acknowledge that circumstances are in eternal flux. Both Rogers and
Mintzberg are correct, the world is unpredictable, but proper strategic
planning includes provisions for this uncertainty, such as scenario
planning (Hill et al. 2004, 23).</p>
<p>
Hamel (1996) argues that strategic planning as it is practised in
business management is not strategic at all. He claims that strategy
development tends to be a reductionist process, based on simple rules
and heuristics, working from the present to the future, rather than the
other way around. The strategic planning process is mostly
extrapolative, and it is assumed that the future will resemble the past,
an assumption that David Hume has shown to be irrational more than 250
years ago (Prevos 2005). Hamel emphasises the creative aspect of
strategic management and points out that it is not a rote process that
can be instrumentalised in neat systems, but a quest that must be a
subversive revolution to improve company performance (Hamel 1996, 71).</p>

<h3 id="headline-6">
An integrated approach
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Hill et al. (2004, 130) argue that, although luck may be a reason for an
organisation&#39;s success in particular cases, it is an unconvincing
explanation for the persistent success of a company. They find it
&#34;difficult to imagine how sustained excellence <em>…</em> could result from
anything other than a conscious effort&#34; (Hill et al. 2004, 130). There
are, however, many examples of how luck has positively influenced the
future of organisations dramatically, and vice versa how unpredictable
external circumstances have negatively influenced an organisation&#39;s
fortune.</p>
<p>
Empirical research shows a positive correlation between the extent of
formal strategic planning and company performance (Miller &amp; Cardinal
1994, Rogers et al. 1999). This research does, however, not prove a
causal link between strategic planning and company performance. From an
evolutionary perspective, only those companies that maintain a positive
performance will survive. The research did not include an analysis of
failed companies and their strategic planning. Furthermore, the research
focusses on realised strategies. Mintzberg argues in this context that
achieved strategy is always a combination of intended and emergent
strategies (Mintzberg 1979, Mintzberg 1987). Following Mintzberg&#39;s
typology of strategy formulation, the positive correlation between
strategic planning and performance is not only based on formal,
intended, strategy. Emergent strategy, and thus serendipity, luck and
informal strategy formulation, play an essential role in achieving
positive performance. This concept also explains the seeming
contradiction between Rogers and Mintzberg regarding the influence of
turbulence. Hill et al. (2004, 21) recognise the mutual importance of
intended and emergent strategy and stress that management needs to
understand the process of emergence and intervene when appropriate. Even
though these strategies evolve without going through the formal process,
management needs to evaluate these and select those that align with the
vision set for the organisation.</p>
<p>
Hart (1992) summarises the discourse between proponents of strict formal
planning and those that stress the limits of this approach. He refers to
formal planning as the rational model for strategy formulation. The
rational model advocates to consider all available alternatives,
identify and evaluate all of the consequences of each option and then
select the preferred alternative. Researchers challenging this approach
argue that organisations can achieve only limited rationality because of
individual cognitive limits, heuristics and biases in human judgement.</p>
<p>
Hart proposes an integrated approach to strategy formulation. Hart
argues that prior literature on the subject has focused on a particular
theme and has failed to capture the full range of the phenomenon of
strategic planning.</p>
<p>
An integrated approach to strategic management is required to get the
full benefits. Strategic planning will not automatically positively
influence performance once put into place; it requires constant
&#34;tinkering and kludging&#34; to deal with continually changing
circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="headline-7">
Strategic management as a science
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Research into strategy formulation has resulted in a plethora of
strategic management theories. The fundamental differences between
individual approaches and the fact that they come and go in quick
succession support the claim that there is no firm scientific basis for
theories of management (Miller &amp; Vaughan 2001, 5).</p>
<p>
Strategic management theory is an eclectic field with contributions from
military history, engineering, industrial economics, organisational
sociology, behavioural, cognitive and social psychology, anthropology
and political science (Foster &amp; Browne 1996, 21). Strategic management
is thus more aligned with social sciences than the exact sciences and as
such needs a methodology to suit the unpredictability of human
behaviour, rather than a rational model, feigning predictability.</p>
<p>
Management deals with human beings and their social interaction and both
the external and internal environment are in a constant state of flux. A
strategy will only improve performance if its formulation takes the
fundamental unpredictability of the world into account. Strategy cannot
be formulated through rational systems that model the real world.
Formulating strategy is a continuously developing narrative between the
organisation and the external environment.</p>

Conclusion
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>In this essay, the question of whether strategic planning has, on
average, a positive impact on company performance has been investigated.
It has been argued that this is indeed the case, but a business can not
rely on formal strategy planning alone to affect performance positively.</p>
<p>
Although research (Miller &amp; Cardinal 1994, Rogers et al. 1999) has
established a positive correlation between strategic planning and
company performance, it has not found a causal relationship between
formal strategic planning and improved company performance. Strategy
formulation is a complex synergy of intended and emergent strategy, and
positive company performance is brought about by a combination of both.</p>
<p>
It has also been argued that strategic management as science is closely
related to social sciences and that the methodology of strategy
formulation needs to fit the nature of the discipline. This idea does
not mean that strategic planning is a futile exercise. Even in uncharted
waters, a course needs to be chosen, even if there are no reference
points for orientation. Strategic planning is vital for ensuring
continued good company performance. Only those organisations that
practice some form of strategic planning will survive. Not strategy as a
rational model to plot the course for years ahead, but as a narrative
between the organisation and the external environment, anticipating the
unpredictability of external influences.</p>
