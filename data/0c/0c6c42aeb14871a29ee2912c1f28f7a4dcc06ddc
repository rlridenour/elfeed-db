Christian Tietze has a nice post on <a href="https://christiantietze.de/posts/2025/10/sharpening-the-saw-with-emacs/">sharpening the Emacs saw</a> as part of <a href="https://plaindrops.de/blog/2025/emacscarnival/">this month&rsquo;s Emacs Carnival on Maintenance</a>. Like many of us, Tietze found that he was moving more and more of his work into Emacs. Finally, he found himself with a bespoke Emacs that was his alone.

Once you have your very own personalized Emacs, you have to maintain it. It&rsquo;s not necessarily that way for other editors. I was a Vim user for over two decades and very rarely did any maintenance other than compiling and installing new versions. With Emacs, it seems as if I&rsquo;m always tweaking some setting or adding a new package.

Tietze compares this to taking care of your tools and work area in, say, a woodworking shop. As he puts it, you can&rsquo;t cut with a dull saw. You need to take care of your tools, not just use them. Equally important, you need to think about how you use your tools and what you&rsquo;ve accomplished with them in the past.

Tietze says that he considers the time spent tinkering with Emacs and personalizing his computing environment as an investment in his future. It&rsquo;s like sweeping out and organizing the shop and keeping everything neat and tidy so that you can work unfettered by distracting clutter.

Tietze makes a point I&rsquo;ve often made myself. Once you shape Emacs into the computing environment that&rsquo;s specialized for you, you have a perfect tool that you can take with you wherever you go. In our environment, that means whatever operating system or computer you&rsquo;re using. Emacs runs just about everywhere.</p>
