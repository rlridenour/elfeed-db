<p>When <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/04/01/irreal-likes-ramrezs-journelly-irrealorg.html">I wrote about Journelly</a> the other day, I didn&rsquo;t expect the guy who makes the app to find me and my post, and <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/journelly-vs-emacs-why-not-both">answer my post on his own blog</a>. It surprises me every time I get an email or a response because I don&rsquo;t really think anyone really reads this blog.</p>
<p>It makes sense that some Emacs folks on Fosstodon would find me, sure, we&rsquo;re all crazy for the same thing after all, but then I also get email from people who take the time to write in length and open up more, and I just feel this semi-guilt of, &ldquo;hey, why are you reading my stuff, I&rsquo;m just talking nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My most popular posts (<a href="https://taonaw.com/2024/03/13/just-another-note.html">I use TinyLytics</a> to track traffic, it&rsquo;s by an independent developer, and it just tracks the essentials, like general geographical location and browser used to read what pages) are Emacs and org-mode related, without a doubt, but there are other posts here as well. As time passes, I open up about more things in my life, or I care less about what people think, or probably a mix of both - and I&rsquo;m also getting comments about those here and there. That&rsquo;s especially exciting to me.</p>
<p>First, there&rsquo;s some sense of vindication in that (if you grew up being somewhat on any social spectrum, you&rsquo;ve probably experience enough of &ldquo;you are wrong and you need to do X because X is what the rest of the world is doing&rdquo; kind of thing). Second, these communications are always more personal and human. Emacs communications is great too, but it&rsquo;s more of the thrill of learning a new thing.</p>
<p>Back to Journelly. I owe both Irreal and Álvaro an apology. Not that what I said was negative criticism in any way (and if it was, I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way) - it&rsquo;s just that I didn&rsquo;t do enough research to learn about the app. I just read the review linked from Irreal, which didn&rsquo;t really highlight the fact that the app is <em>based on org-mode</em>. That&rsquo;s a big DUH, folks! Álvaro also created Plain Org, which I&rsquo;ve used, among other useful Emacs surprises!</p>
