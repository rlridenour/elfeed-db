<blockquote>
  <p>A federal appeals court rejected the Trump administration’s
request that it halt the next steps <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/17/politics/paula-xinis-judge-kilmar-abrego-garcia/index.html">Judge Paula Xinis</a> is
seeking to take in the case concerning a migrant who was wrongly
deported to El Salvador, with a strident warning about the rule of
law and the possibility the dispute presented an “incipient
crisis.”</p>

<p>The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals said in its <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25900477/25-1404-ruling.pdf">seven-page
ruling</a> Thursday that the Trump administration’s assertions
in the case “should be shocking not only to judges, but to the
intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from
courthouses still hold dear.”</p>

<p>The unanimous ruling was written by Judge Harvie Wilkinson, an
appointee of former President Ronald Reagan. In it, he was
extremely critical of the administration’s effort to undo some of
Xinis’ recent orders in the case, sounding alarm bells about how
its maneuverings in the matter have resulted in the two branches
“grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that
promises to diminish both.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quoting <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25900477/25-1404-ruling.pdf">from Wilkinson’s order</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the
matter. But in this case, it is not hard at all. The government is
asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in
foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the
foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in
essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is
nothing that can be done.</p>

<p>This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive
sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still
hold dear.</p>

<p>The government asserts that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a
member of MS-13. Perhaps, but perhaps not. Regardless, he is still
entitled to due process. If the government is confident of its
position, it should be assured that position will prevail in
proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No minced words. No equivocation. No histrionics either. Just calling it like it is. More like this, please. This needs to be faced head-on, with plain language.</p>
