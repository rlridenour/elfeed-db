<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying  <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780316459099">A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians</a> by H. G. Parry 📚 more than I thought I would.</p>
<p>Parry&rsquo;s ability to describe feelings and thoughts going through the mind of people works like glue between plot points and characters. It&rsquo;s been a while since I was able to get into the heads of the characters I&rsquo;m reading about and see them clearly in my mind&rsquo;s eye. Such a difference from my previous book!</p>
