<p>In the latest development, Danish and Greenlandic leaders say a “fundamental disagreement” with President Trump remains after their first high-level talks in Washington about his stated desire for U.S. control of Greenland. While Denmark and Greenland reiterated that the island is not for sale and stressed sovereignty and Greenlandic self-determination, the parties agreed to set up a working group to look for a way forward on Arctic security concerns.
