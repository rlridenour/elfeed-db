A few smaller-scale Apple Intelligence enhancements will be announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-wwdc-2025-keynote-june-9/">at WWDC 2025 next week</a>, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/apple-wwdc-2025-preview-ios-26-macos-26-new-ai-features-ipados-26-redesigns"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

One planned upgrade that had not been reported until now is the ability to create a Genmoji by combining a pair of existing standard emoji. For example, Gurman said that you will be able to turn separate basketball and trash can emoji into a single Genmoji that shows a basketball going into a trash can.<br/>
<br/>
He also expects iOS 26 to include an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/shortcuts-app-apple-intelligence-integration/">upgraded Shortcuts app powered by Apple Intelligence</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/ios-19-ai-battery-management/">new AI-powered battery mode</a>, as he previously reported.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, he said there will be system-wide Translate app capabilities on iOS 26. <em>9to5Mac</em> previously reported that the Messages app would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/ios-26-messages-app-rumors/">gaining live translation capabilities</a>, but Gurman said it will extend to the Phone app and other areas of the operating system. A live translation feature is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/airpods-live-translation-ios-19/">also expected for AirPods</a>.<br/>

Waiting on Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">delayed personalized Siri features</a> to launch? Don't get your hopes up next week, as Gurman said that those features remain "far off." He does not expect any significant new Siri features to be announced at WWDC 2025.<br/>

What happened to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/apple-announced-swift-assist-wwdc24-so-where-is-it/">Swift Assist</a>, the coding assistance tool that Apple announced at WWDC 2024? Gurman said it faced issues, so Apple instead plans to let developers use Xcode <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/02/apple-anthropic-ai-coding-platform/">with third-party large language models</a> (LLMs).<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/genmoji-upgrade-for-ios-26/">Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2025: Genmoji Upgrade Incoming Instead of Personalized Siri</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-at-wwdc-2025-genmoji-upgrade-incoming-instead-of-personalized-siri.2458303/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
