<p>A few times over the last couple of years I&rsquo;ve wanted to do an open poll to get a feel for how users felt about things, particularly icons during the design process. I found there aren&rsquo;t a lot of affordable ways to do this.</p>

<p>What I wanted was a way to upload multiple images and get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting">ranked-choice voting</a> on them. If you&rsquo;re not familiar, ranked voting is a system where voters rank their choices in order of preference, and then an algorithm is used to determine the winner. So your second choice vote doesn&rsquo;t get lost if your first choice doesn&rsquo;t win &mdash; it becomes part of the aggregate. It&rsquo;s the way US elections <em>should</em> be run<sup id="fnref:ec"><a href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:ec" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So I built <a href="https://rnkd.xyz">RNKD</a>. I took a morning away from working on Marked 3 to build it, but that&rsquo;s all it took. It&rsquo;s not a complicated beast, just does what it says on the tin. Sign in with an email address, create a poll by uploading images and adding optional captions, then share the link to the poll. Voters don&rsquo;t need to log in, and anyone with the link can vote. Share it with your team, your friends, or your whole social network. Voting is anonymous.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s currently no mechanism to prevent the same person from voting multiple times, which I should probably build in sooner than later if this is going to be used seriously. But assuming everyone voting isn&rsquo;t intentionally trying to rig the game, it works great as is.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a demo poll: <a href="https://rnkd.xyz/poll/cmfr9kfa4000116yj4zed83ht">RNKD Logo Options</a></p>

<p>You can sign in and create your own polls at <a href="https://rnkd.xyz">https://rnkd.xyz</a>.</p>

      <p>And adding more than two parties. That and doing away with the Electoral College would be a good start. But I digress.&nbsp;<a href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:ec" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
