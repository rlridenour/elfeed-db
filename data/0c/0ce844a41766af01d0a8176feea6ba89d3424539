<p>Lithuania has declared a nationwide state of emergency after hundreds of unmanned balloons and some drones, allegedly launched from neighboring Belarus, repeatedly violated its airspace and disrupted civil aviation throughout the year. The government says the balloons, many carrying contraband cigarettes and sometimes small incendiary devices, form part of a broader &quot;hybrid&quot; pressure campaign by Belarus, a close ally of Russia, against the NATO and EU member state. Under the emergency regime, Vilnius has asked parliament to grant the military expanded powers to support police and border guards in patrolling, tracking and recovering aerial cargo near the frontier. Lithuanian officials argue the sustained incursions risk midair collisions, have already forced multiple temporary airport closures and flight diversions, and warrant fresh European Union sanctions aimed at curbing Belarus’s ability to mount such operations.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uFCdcjgZdsRHDdcS2fpkUJaW6YLRTdJJziboAd96yPEGl1iDWV_IwCo4gg13bGZf5igumbs-bm9CLBB8OH0Y62XZZrdMmPOcQitFtcqzfQvmMm43uhmfBrqGiXohc1h2tHGNiR4q3LE7OUJ7_B8m7L-NR0iqavidHP8iMzRD3GeEQTvY9q3-sJd3IZANiBJZbyWcGwhcBH51rAjRJLYSvQ' alt='A Lithuanian officer examines a balloon used to transport contraband cigarettes across the border from Belarus.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Aviation disruptions: Lithuania’s interior ministry reports that this year’s balloon and drone incursions prompted more than 300 flight disruptions and dozens of hours of airport closures, affecting tens of thousands of passengers using Vilnius Airport and other facilities.</li><li>Border security response: Joint evening patrols pairing soldiers with police have already been operating along the frontier to detect and secure dropped cargo, and the emergency status is intended to formalize and expand this cooperation.</li><li>Belarusian reaction: Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko has dismissed Lithuania’s concerns over the balloons as exaggerated and referred to Vilnius’s response as petty, rejecting accusations of orchestrating hybrid attacks.</li><li>EU sanction push: Lithuanian diplomats have urged the European Union to prepare a new package of measures targeting individuals and entities in Belarus they say are involved in organizing the aerial smuggling and pressure tactics along the border.</li><li>Hybrid tactics context: Lithuanian officials link the balloon activity to a wider pattern that has included migrant movements and other cross‑border pressure tools since Belarus’s 2020 political crisis and Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which tightened Minsk’s alignment with Moscow.</li></ul><blockquote>It’s clear that this emergency is being declared not only because of disruptions to civil aviation, but also due to national security concerns and the need for closer coordination among institutions - Vladislav Kondratovič</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Lithuanian government: Officials portray the balloons and drones as deliberate, coordinated hybrid attacks that threaten flight safety and test NATO’s external border, arguing that only a strengthened security posture and tighter EU sanctions can deter further provocations.
