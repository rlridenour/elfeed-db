<p>Adelaide Writers’ Week in Australia is facing escalating withdrawals after organisers rescinded an invitation to Palestinian-Australian academic and author Randa Abdel-Fattah. Several prominent writers, including former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, have pulled out, and multiple board members have resigned, leaving the event’s future uncertain. Organisers and some politicians have framed the decision as a response to community sensitivities following the December 14 Bondi Beach attack at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration, while many writers argue the removal raises serious free-speech and artistic-independence concerns.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/sZvJKWsCQ_0GiJ7wWytoXMu2RmVAFOzcU4AyY53dE1aY-GBwEAdDHkWncdgCTlQnPcr802q2VR8fncINlXP8JJa7zNu_95pAWksAHzb4pyHptyYkGLAnfe-GQp-VZxV6NCBAzZnYBQlog2HeOi7Sn1PdYh3Y6XWdDaTL3rroava5xUyIlTT8IcRdZ9ij0pIL6ExR0cR9O_Q5IkJ3GeFmMA6e7lCdTgvXLgPlZNlkMyrWzbJZv6ube8My' alt='Randa Abdel-Fattah&#x27;s invite to appear at the Adelaide Writers&#x27; Week has been cancelled.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Political backing: Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King publicly supported the festival board’s decision to remove Abdel-Fattah, as the dispute broadened from a programming call into a national political argument about boundaries in public debate.</li><li>Stated rationale: Organisers cited concerns that Abdel-Fattah’s appearance could be “culturally insensitive” in the wake of the Bondi attack, a justification that has become a focal point of the backlash.</li><li>Scale of withdrawals: Al Jazeera reported about 100 writers withdrew and four board members quit, underscoring how quickly festival programming and governance can unravel once trust breaks down.</li><li>Reuters framing: A Reuters report highlighted that the boycott is unfolding alongside broader Australian moves to curb antisemitism, with critics warning those efforts can collide with free-speech protections in cultural spaces.</li><li>Lobbying allegations: Michael West Media argued the decision followed external pressure—specifically pointing to lobbying and media influence—claims not adopted by other outlets but central to that publication’s account of how the dispute escalated.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Adelaide Festival board/organisers: The organisers argued that proceeding with the author’s appearance risked being “culturally insensitive” given the recent Bondi attack, and removed her from the lineup on that basis.
