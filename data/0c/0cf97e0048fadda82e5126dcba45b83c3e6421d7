<p id="p2">If you&rsquo;ve ever found yourself juggling multiple chargers for your iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and AirPods in a hotel room, you need to check out <a href="https://amzn.to/3Vo1iXz" rel="noopener noreferrer">TESSAN&rsquo;s 140W GaN Universal Travel Adapter</a>. Its compact design replaces your entire charging setup with a single, intelligently designed adapter that works in over 200 countries, delivering the power you need.</p>
<p id="p3">The TESSAN adapter leverages GaN technology to deliver 140W of total power through three USB-C ports and one USB-A port, while maintaining a footprint smaller than most laptop chargers. The top USB-C port delivers up to 100W&mdash;enough to fast-charge a MacBook Pro while the remaining ports will intelligently distribute power to charge your other devices simultaneously. The universal plug design features slide-out prongs for U.S., UK, EU, and Australian outlets, eliminating the need to pack multiple regional adapters.</p>
<p id="p4">The TESSAN adapter also includes surge protection, over-current protection, and temperature control. Plus, the GaN semiconductor technology generates less heat than traditional silicon-based chargers, making it safer for extended use in cramped spaces.</p>
<p id="p5">MacStories readers can get the TESSAN Universal Travel Adapter now on <a href="https://amzn.to/3Vo1iXz" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>.</p>
