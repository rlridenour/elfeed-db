Apple is closing the store to complete maintenance on the signature glass cube entrance, according to a source familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's explanation internally is "preservation work."<br/>
<br/>
Opened in 2006, Apple Fifth Avenue features a street-level glass cube entrance, leading to an underground store. Apple's CEO Tim Cook and other company executives often attend the store for major new product launches.<br/>

The store's cube has been outfitted with everything from a giant Apple Vision Pro headset outline to colorful Siri glow in recent years.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/apple-fifth-avenue-overnight-closure/">Apple&#039;s Fifth Avenue Store is Closing Overnight Next Week, Here&#039;s Why</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-fifth-avenue-store-is-closing-overnight-next-week-heres-why.2476834/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
