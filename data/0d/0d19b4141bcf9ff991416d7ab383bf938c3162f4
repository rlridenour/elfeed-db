<p>Saudi Arabia’s military coalition carried out what it called limited, pre-emptive air strikes in southern Yemen after Yemen’s Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council expelled Southern Transitional Council (STC) leader Aidarous al-Zubaidi and referred him to prosecutors on allegations of “high treason” tied to secession efforts. Coalition officials said al-Zubaidi failed to travel to Riyadh for talks intended to defuse recent southern clashes, then moved forces and fled to an unknown location. The STC disputes claims that its leader fled, saying he is continuing his duties from Aden, even as the episode deepens strains within the anti-Houthi camp and highlights the fragile nature of alliances in Yemen’s long-running war. Hospital sources cited by AFP reported civilian casualties from the strikes, underscoring the immediate human cost as political and military power struggles play out.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/sjicG0ZTrASd33sShAo5nwqfiJiKF341Iabxu598d4AxbubbvwHc_Yvf2moWaESQH7UmZKXWilnCxAf7vl8Eeh-jQY1Not6zyA09qOyPDJio' alt='Police stand at a checkpoint in Aden after coalition claims STC leader Aidarous al-Zubaidi fled on Jan 7, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Casualty reports: Medical sources at Al-Nasr and Al-Tadamon hospitals in al-Dhale told AFP the initial toll was four civilian deaths and six wounded after the strikes.</li><li>Strike rationale: Coalition spokesperson Maj Gen Turki al-Malki described the attacks as “limited pre-emptive operations” meant to stop separatist forces from widening fighting in the south.</li><li>Riyadh delegation: The STC said it lost contact overnight with a separate delegation that had already traveled to Riyadh for negotiations and asked Saudi authorities to guarantee the delegation’s safety.</li><li>Leadership dispute: An STC official told AFP that al-Zubaidi declined to fly to Saudi Arabia after receiving information he would be asked to dissolve the group, which also has representation in Yemen’s governing structures.</li><li>Who he is: Al Jazeera profiled al-Zubaidi as a prominent southern figure whose path includes roles in local governance before leading the STC’s push to restore a southern Yemeni state.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Saudi-led coalition: Coalition officials say al-Zubaidi skipped planned talks in Riyadh, mobilized forces, and fled, prompting strikes aimed at preventing escalation.
