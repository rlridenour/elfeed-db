<p>Jon Prosser, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE">in a YouTube video</a> with mocked-up animations showing exactly what he’s talking about, 51 days ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today we have your very first exclusive look at the changes coming
to iOS 19 — with a redesigned camera app and possibly ... a
redesigned iOS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basic idea is something very much akin to the look and feel of VisionOS, but brought to the Camera app, and perhaps throughout the entire system (or just parts of it) in iOS 19. Seems cool, seems fresh, and seems aligned with where Apple has been heading.</p>

<p>Here’s Parker Ortolani, himself a talented designer with a particularly keen eye for trends, <a href="https://parker.micro.blog/2025/02/04/apple-invites-screams-that-an.html">writing on his blog February 4 after Apple Invites debuted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rumored <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/introducing-apple-invites-a-new-app-that-brings-people-together/">Apple Invites</a> app has arrived. While I
obviously haven’t had much time to play with it, I have quickly
browsed through the UI and wanted to share some observations. The
last new Apple app, Apple Sports, already felt out of place in iOS
18. It has a more visionOS or watchOS-like design language
utilizing colorful backgrounds, glassy floating UI elements,
expanding buttons, and lots of layered shapes. Apple Invites takes
it all even further. It’s got big beautiful cards, translucent
cells, big bold buttons, and an emphasis on content. It feels so
clearly like a hint of what is to come in a future iOS update.
It’s almost screaming it in our faces. It seems awfully suspect
that Apple’s two latest apps have a whole new design language that
does not mesh with the rest of the OS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now comes today, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/apple-readies-dramatic-design-overhauls-for-ios-19-ipados-19-and-macos-16">Mark Gurman dropping this vagueness at Bloomberg</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The revamp — due later this year — will fundamentally change the
look of the operating systems and make Apple’s various software
platforms more consistent, according to people familiar with the
effort. That includes updating the style of icons, menus, apps,
windows and system buttons. As part of the push, the company is
working to simplify the way users navigate and control their
devices, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the project hasn’t been announced. The design is loosely based on
the Vision Pro’s software, they said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s it. No screenshots. No mockups. No specific description of the changes. Just “loosely based on the Vision Pro’s software”. Jon Prosser not only said this was coming, but commissioned full, realistic animations to illustrate it, <em>51 days ago</em>. And astute observers like Ortolani <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlDeXwQSay8">and others</a> have observed, for over a month, that Apple itself is starting to hint at this new design language in its own already-shipping new apps for iOS.</p>

<p>I’m so old I remember when YouTubers made videos about months-old Gurman stories, not the other way around. There’s weak sauce, and then there’s eating paste.</p>
