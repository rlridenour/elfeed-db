<p>I use Hugo to generate my web site and I made a decision early on to use <code>ox-hugo</code> withing emacs and to manage a single large <code>org</code> file with each subheading a blog post and each subheading tag representing&hellip; well, tags! I was aware of the concept of defining categories but decided to sort that out at a later date until I really understood what I was doing - this is a common thing that I do.</p>

<p>Well now I think I understand what I&rsquo;m doing and now I want to create categories for my web site and as it turns out managing my posts within org files means that this can be achieved very easily.</p>
<p>For example, I have the following set up in my org file:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">* Emacs [0/0] :emacs:linux:
** DONE Initial focus in Occur Buffer :occur:elisp:2023:
** DONE Cursor Blinking Rate :2023:
</code></pre><p>This means that the subheadings / posts under the top level <code>Emacs</code> heading inherit the <code>emacs</code> and <code>linux</code> tags and then define any extra specific to each post as desired.  As these tags are defined at the top level then you could almost say they are defining a more broad definition, lets say a category!</p>
<p>So how do I change these top level tags to categories?, well I define the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">* Emacs [0/0] :@emacs:@linux:
</code></pre><p>It is just a very slight change to the org tag definition after which I just need to re-export all my blog posts / subheadings using the <code>ox-hugo</code> dispatcher.</p>
<p>The generated markdown files now contain the following front matter which Hugo can now process accordingly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>tags = [&#34;occur&#34;, &#34;elisp&#34;, &#34;2023&#34;]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>categories = [&#34;emacs&#34;, &#34;linux&#34;]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Simple! and in fact you can see an example of how the categories are incorporated in this very web site!</p>
