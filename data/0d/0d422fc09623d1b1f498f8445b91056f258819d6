<p>Attempting to take photos 📷, I realized two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I forgot my camera&rsquo;s charger at home, and it&rsquo;s too old for the local CVS to have the right USB cable 😖.</li>
<li>My photography skills are rusty. I can see the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of the photo and the reason I took it, but it&rsquo;s not quite there.</li>
</ol>
