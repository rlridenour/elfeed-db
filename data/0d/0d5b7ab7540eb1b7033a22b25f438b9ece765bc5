<p>Donald Trump, on his blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only reason Marjorie “Traitor” Brown (Green turns Brown under
stress!) went BAD is that she was JILTED by the President of the
United States (Certainly not the first time she has been jilted!).
Too much work, not enough time, and her ideas are, NOW, really BAD — She sort of reminds me of a Rotten Apple! Marjorie is not
AMERICA FIRST or MAGA, because nobody could have changed her views
so fast, and her new views are those of a very dumb person. That
was proven last night when washed up, Trump hating, 60 Minutes
“correspondent,” Lesley Stahl, who still owes me an apology from
when she attacked me on the show (with serious conviction!), that
Hunter Biden’s LAPTOP FROM HELL was produced by Russia, not Hunter
himself (TOTALLY PROVEN WRONG!), interviewed a very poorly
prepared Traitor, who in her confusion made many really stupid
statements. My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low
IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes,
Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER
THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for
FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME! Since they
bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE! Oh well, far
worse things can happen. P.S. I hereby demand a complete and total
APOLOGY, though far too late to be meaningful, from Lesley Stahl
and 60 Minutes for her incorrect and Libelous statements about
Hunter’s Laptop!!! President DJT</p>

<p>Trump’s expectation isn’t that <em>60 Minutes</em>, along with the entirety of CBS News, along with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/07/curse_not_the_king_cbs_colbert_trump">the entirety of CBS TV programming</a>, would tilt in Trump’s direction after its acquisition (as part of Paramount) by David Ellison’s Skydance. Trump’s expectation is that all of CBS, every minute of the broadcast day, should appeal to and appease him.</p>
