<p>A new evidence review in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology &amp; Women’s Health concludes there is no evidence that taking paracetamol/acetaminophen during pregnancy increases the risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability in children. The findings push back against warnings President Donald Trump made in 2025 about Tylenol use in pregnancy and are being framed by researchers as reassurance for people who need pain or fever relief while pregnant. The debate has also highlighted regulatory differences, with US and European authorities having taken different stances on the evidence.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qJw0MWuu-R1PpyGK08QDhqbL_9BbfySBbDtDF7KyCR8IMLHj-f8vdApeHvH2kzEsoJptmehiLY5entZpHZVfyHVZs2kKslj37pPhLooFGY80FP7vYvMFux4du2XlRNn2EAWAf4EyUVxEjGiCmae7easE6BEg0VZOwIX1-Qe56goKN28gaKMytEVdi2uUBSauyH830UwFamx07ge9B7W0GgpGpR0NeNyaTuR44BjFLUJpOohnG52q0IO0Ahk2VbMWiF01rLJtpLubHQoZFygk' alt='' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Evidence base: The review synthesized results from 43 studies, which the reports describe as a high-rigor (“gold standard”) assessment of the existing literature.</li><li>Researcher message: Lead author Asma Khalil, a consultant obstetrician and fetal medicine specialist at St George’s Hospital in London, said the results should reassure “millions of pregnant individuals” who may need the medicine.</li><li>Policy divergence: Politico reports the US Food and Drug Administration ordered a new safety warning be added to Tylenol leaflets, while the European Medicines Agency said at the time it found no evidence of an autism link.</li><li>Political context: Politico attributes the earlier US position to Republicans aligned with the “MAHA — Make America Healthy Again” movement led by US Health Secretary Robert F.
