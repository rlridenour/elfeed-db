</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Teasing at those moments of concurrent reading, and reflecting on a life and how to live it.
</p>
        <p><i class="new-thought">I finished reading</i> <cite data-id="74f46596-7e82-4fe7-9921-a60da8c558c0">William Blake and the Sea Monsters of Love</cite> by Philip Hoare.  A personal encounter with William Blake and his legacy; of art
and artists who each crafted their own mythology.  The book moves as the ocean,
surging and receding, eternal in its rebirth.  Always arriving, never leaving.
This book will sit with me.  For the explosion of connections, vignettes, and
references.</p>
<p><i class="new-thought">Later, I was reading my RSS feed</i> and I paused and skipped over <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/i-spent-90-days-rebuilding-my-brain-here-s-what-i-learned-b7844d4127c5d542">I
Spent 90 Days Rebuilding My Brain. Here&rsquo;s What I Learned.</a>  I wasn’t ready to
ingest one of Joan’s lengthy articles.  After I’d read everything and thought
about writing, I returned to her post.</p>
<p>In the article, she provides a template for rewiring our brain.  There’s the
narrative form, but then the bullet list of each activities goals.  I feel as
though I’m working through that.  Albeit without the specifics.</p>
<p>What are my distractions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boardgame Arena</li>
<li>Mastodon</li>
<li>Checking for emails</li>
</ul>
<p>William and Kate Blake removed distractions, working with a focus on generating
a new method of producing art, creating a vivid view into his/their prophetic
vision.</p>
<p>Reading Philip Hoare, he chases opportunity to engage with, produce, and revel
in art.  In his writing, a reflective pulse carries the reader (that’s me) along
a journey that dances through centuries.  There are the artists and the tenders
of art.</p>
<p>Knowing that we require both for these (artist and tender) for relics to
survive; and have collective fading memories of knowing what we lost.  While
burning Ninevah fired the clay tablets, most fires brought to art instead
destroy.  Or rats gnaw on them.  Or they rattle into into dust as they’re
smuggled out of ancient museums.</p>
<p>Oh, what have we lost?  Trees most certainly.  But languages and voices.  Even
accents are blending into a homogeneous bland pulp.  And mono-cultures are
doomed to die.</p>
<p>Tolkien tapped into sense of loss sparking his impetuous for creating Middle
Earth.  Blake, took <em>Paradise Lost</em> and crafted a higher order mythology.  One
that portents the Lovecraftian cosmic horror; producing the cracks through which
the eldritch horrors might burst into the minds eye.</p>
<p>Those eldritch horrors?  Kafka provides insight into their mindless
machinations.  Not by revealing the eldritch but by engaging with the maddening
mundane.  I’ve read a story or two by Lovecraft, but aside from the exotic
venues, <cite data-id="d334ef0c-4398-479f-ad82-4d8b9e993d2c">The Trial</cite> by Franz Kafka strikes me as more of a cosmic horror.</p>
<p>I have a personal library, with wisdom and prophecy abundant, that should last
me a lifetime…if the torches and bonfires remain at bay.</p>
<p>This relates to <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/i-spent-90-days-rebuilding-my-brain-here-s-what-i-learned-b7844d4127c5d542">I Spent 90 Days Rebuilding My Brain. Here&rsquo;s What I Learned</a> and
<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction">Artificial Intelligence</a></span> (<abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Artificial Intelligence”" title="Other site-wide references of “Artificial Intelligence”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-AI">&#128214;</a></small>)
 and my job.  In that I desire to buttress my brain against the maelstrom of
cognitive erosion, now raging and ever escalating.  The value of knowledge is
quite high and wisdom to act as well.  Yet there’s precarity, as the maelstrom
erodes the foundations of thought, manners, taste, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Buttress is only partially the correct action, for I must also remain nimble.
Remember to take small steps, for it is during our steps in which we are at our
most precarious.</p>
<p>So I reflect on what, at work, it is that I’ve accomplished in my first year on
this job, but 27 year in the “industry.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Learned Go-lang to create an application that helped customers manage multiple
Google Marketplace product subscriptions.</li>
<li>Learned Elixir to write a new integration test suite for a Go-lang
command-line tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>– In both choices, I wrote decision documents explaining my choice of language
as well as approach.  In part to model decision making but also to allow for
feedback before I began.</p>
<ul>
<li>Used a mix of static code analysis, callgraph traversal, and LSP to audit our
code-base, to determine which API end-points may not be reporting events.</li>
</ul>
<p>I write the above as a digital placeholder to update my resume.  Maybe I’ll
remember it when the time comes to again seek another job; not that I’m looking
to do so, I just know that fortune favors the prepared.</p>
<p>Let’s pull a bit back.  There is a war against our abilities to <del>gain knowledge</del>
find information.  Colonialism has come for a notable portion of our
share/collective identity, that is the works legible to the machine.  An attack
on our shared “gains.”  Rent-seeking against the very human activity of
thinking.</p>
<p>The systems are eating their seeds.  When I started at my first job, they
provided on the job training to get me up to speed.  Both in the langauge as
well as through system overviews.  Its hard to imagine a place in the present
day in which that training time and the rigor of the onboarding would exist.
And <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>
 is going to make this worst.  Because, at least for me, I exercised my
early career skills into mid-career skills.</p>
<p>What damage will be done to groups that rely on <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>
 to write, summarize, and
respond?  Who has synthesized that information into knowledge?</p>
<p>The pre-historic, as defined as no written language, hold rich histories.
Carried by voice and ritual across the millennia, shifting, I’m sure, as
understanding shifts.  My father is a fantastic story teller, his first language
of Low German being one that he can barely read.</p>
<p>Which has me thinking of something I often uttered at Notre Dame: “We have
strong oral traditions.”  I used that as a back-handed compliment; highlighting
that information was poorly shared and what was, was invariably done through
word of mouth.  And for a place that housed hundreds of thousands of volumes of
the written word, this lack of writing things down felt as an odd reverence to
the books in custody.  As though the operations of the library were of less
value than the objects on which they operated.</p>
<p>As our knowledge mixes with the slop, what endeavors remain valuable and by
extension increase in value relative to the sucking maw of consumptive <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>
.  I
think about things that are desirous for <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>
 to consume.  There is also
remediation of that which <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>
 deemed as truth/correct but in fact was faulty and
false.</p>
<p>Agnes Callard, in <cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite> called attention to William James’s quote:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

We must know the truth; and we must avoid error—these are our first and greatest
commandments as would-be knowers; but they are not two ways of stating an
identical commandment, they are two separate laws.

</blockquote>

<p>Callard then walks through an exercise of what it means to favor truth over
avoiding error, and vice versa.  And <span>Large Language Models</span> (<abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Large Language Models”" title="Other site-wide references of “Large Language Models”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-LLM">&#128214;</a></small>)
 fail on both fronts.  They do not
spout truth nor do they avoid error.  There’s more to the “The Gadfly-Midwife
Paradox” chapter that also breaks open the idea of thinking as an individual
exercise as well as teasing apart the temporal reality of those two poles.</p>
<p>I also take the lessons of «The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas», and consider
that I want to reduce my participation in the sibling of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>
: the attention
seeking vampires.  To prioritize exploring life in analogue; a bit in tension as
I write this on a computer.</p>
<p>I hope to live that which is less legible: gardening, going for walks, visiting
and hosting friends, reading, and writing.  These all can be legible, but doing
so such that the nature of it all is a private treasure.</p>
<p><i class="new-thought">Over a lunch hour</i> I read more of <cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite> by Agnes Callard.
And feel called towards that exploration.  A good life is one of inquiry, I feel
that ring true.  However, that phrase falters, as inquiry is a striving towards
betterment.  Meaning, is there an absolute good?  Perhaps.  But what if I just
set my sight on a little better and commit to that.</p>
<p>At one time, I wished to be a smart person.  And found that meant tackling
challenging problems.  Later, I wished to be a wise person, and found that I
faced complex situations.  I laughed at my folly, and said I wanted to be a
contented person; to which I faced loss and abundance untold.  Perhaps graceful,
but I caught myself, as that would mean I’d soon face the tightrope that
ørequired agility, poise, and grace.</p>
<p>Maybe I should drop all aspirational adjectives and choose to be a person.  Yet
what does that mean?  If I don’t seek to be smart, wise, content, and graceful?</p>
<p>I certainly won’t seek to be at peace, for there are wars aplenty that will come
knocking.  So I wonder what does a curious person face?  I suppose accepting
that I don’t already know; and that which I think I know is likely incomplete.</p>
<p><i class="new-thought">After reading more of</i> <cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite>, I set it down to give space.
That space was to read some blog posts.  And Sacha’s <a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/what-im-looking-for-in-my-marriage">What I&rsquo;m looking for in my
marriage</a> struck.  In part because she writes of a monogamous relationship and I
just finished a section that speaks of thinking truth seeking and error
avoidance as a two person job.  A duality.  Now, I need to let this sit.  And
marinate further.</p>
