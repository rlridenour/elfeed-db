<p>President Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency to protect Venezuelan oil-sale revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts, aiming to prevent courts or creditors from seizing the funds. The White House said the move is intended to keep the money available for U.S. foreign policy objectives following the ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. In Venezuela, Maduro supporters held relatively small rallies in Caracas a week after his capture by U.S. forces, while the interim authorities signaled interest in rebuilding ties with Washington.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/6Gq5sxwdFo6XJtrPW425XE2qFUNxcYSA5NDgVyiRSAVa-ji2MKSOmCo-dMaedtodaRd0ad8n4umQR7D6wotZjcrnOD3XdD_BcU8TGiB5btxVqvzIQ6u6jxf_fSlZCwAcYvWT_GKjt3JiG-up9k9P2_SPsnqwX5uz9bunozVydr9J5jG2gJ9nyQHiAZMGdnU8oNEVWl_WPiXE87-p26lFU9P9EdzD9TfLuwU-RUKQB1xCHaOGGg0' alt='President Trump meets oil industry executives at the White House in Washington, DC, on Jan. 9, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Legal shield: The order blocks “attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process” against the U.S.-held oil proceeds, according to the White House.</li><li>Investment push: The order followed a White House meeting where Trump urged oil executives to invest in Venezuela; ExxonMobil’s CEO said the country is “uninvestable” without broad energy-sector reforms, while Chevron is described as the only U.S. firm currently licensed to operate there.</li><li>Protest size: Reports described the demonstrations as far smaller than past Maduro-aligned mobilizations, with roughly 1,000 people in western Caracas and a few hundred in Petare.</li><li>Opposing claims: Venezuela condemned the U.S. operation as a violation of sovereignty, while the White House argued losing control of the funds could empower “malign actors like Iran and Hezbollah”.</li><li>Old disputes: Several U.S. companies have longstanding claims tied to Venezuela’s earlier nationalization of oil assets, which helps explain why courts and creditors might seek access to oil-related proceeds.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House: The administration says protecting the U.S.-held oil proceeds advances U.S. foreign policy goals and keeps the funds from being seized in legal actions.
