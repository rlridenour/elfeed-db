It's been nearly two months since the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> launched, so we thought we'd take another look at the machine now that it's been out long enough to do some serious testing with it.<br/>

Introduced in March, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is equipped with Apple's latest and greatest M4 chip, so it's more than capable of handling day-to-day tasks from web browsing and watching videos to getting work done. It's even powerful enough for photo editing and some light video editing work.<br/>
<br/>
All Macs have a minimum of 16GB RAM now, so the base M4 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; that starts at &#36;999 is a really good deal for what you get. You can upgrade the RAM and the SSD, which may be worthwhile depending on what you want to do on your Mac.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of design, Apple hasn't changed the look of the M4 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; compared to the M3 model, but it does come in a subtle blue shade that's new this year. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; continues to be Apple's most portable Mac, with the 13-inch model weighing just 2.7 pounds. The 15-inch model is heavier at 3.3 pounds, but both models are lighter than the equivalent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
There's an upgraded 12-megapixel front-facing camera for video calls this year, which is a nice upgrade over the prior 1080p camera. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is limited to two USB-C ports and it doesn't have the port selection of the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, nor the ability to support as many displays, but it's perfect for on-the-go use and it is the Mac that we recommend for most people.<br/>
<br/>
With the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, you're going to get a better mini-LED display, ProMotion support, and the option for nano-texture, but those all come with a much higher price tag.<br/>
