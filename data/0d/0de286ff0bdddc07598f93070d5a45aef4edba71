A new rumor today surfaced about Apple's book-style foldable iPhone, set to be released next year, and this time it's about the cameras. <br/>
<br/>

In a previous report, industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expects the foldable iPhone (or "iPhone Fold" for short) to include a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">dual-lens rear camera</a>, but Kuo provided no other specifics. Now, prolific Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PyjLapQqg">Digital Chat Station</a> claims that those dual lenses will be 48 megapixels each.<br/>
<br/>
This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. The current iPhone 16 Pro models feature a 48-megapixel Main camera and a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, and it would make sense for Apple to ensure the premium foldable's rear lenses are at least equivalent to its Pro models to justify that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/">rumored ~&#36;2,000 price tag</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Digital Chat Station did not provide additional lens specifications, but if Apple wants to maintain some feature parity with its high-end iPhone models, the foldable will have a 24mm main camera with a ƒ/1.78 aperture and second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization. <br/>
<br/>
The foldable's main camera will also likely be capable of iPhone 16 "Fusion" – so-called because the system combines the high-resolution sensor with smart in-sensor cropping to deliver multiple high-quality focal lengths – like 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm – from a single main camera. Don't expect a telephoto lens though, likely due to space constraints.<br/>
<br/>
According to Kuo, the foldable will also have a front-facing camera for both folded and unfolded states. Other sources have claimed that the inner display features an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/">under-screen selfie camera</a>, while the outer display – in the device's folded state – will have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/iphone-fold-camera-setup-outer-display/">hole punch-style front-facing camera</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Aside from cameras, here are some other foldable iPhone features we've heard from sources plugged into Apple's supply chain:<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/">5.5-inch outer display</a> with 2,088 x 1,422 resolution.</li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">7.8-inch inner display</a> with 2,713 x 1,920 resolution.</li><br/>
<li>Touch ID integrated into the Side button (i.e. <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">no Face ID</a>).</li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/apple-liquid-metal-foldable-iphone-hinges/">Liquid metal</a> "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/25/apple-2026-foldable-phone-has-no-crease/">crease-free</a>" hinge mechanism.</li><br/>
<li>Same <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">high density battery cells</a> as iPhone 17 Air.</li><br/>
<li><a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">Titanium</a> chassis.</li></ul>Another point of note regarding today's rumor: Digital Chat Station claims that the latest inner display Apple is testing is approximately 7.6 inches rather than 7.8 inches, albeit with the same resolution. <br/>
<br/>
That seems unlikely. Analyst Jeff Pu said in March that the device had entered the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/">New Product Introduction (NPI) phase</a> at Foxconn, and adjusting the display size during or after the NPI phase is virtually unheard of – especially for a company like Apple working with Foxconn. Kuo, who previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">corroborated</a> the 7.8-inch display dimension, also said the device is expected to enter production in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/18/foldable-iphone-manufacturing-2025-start/">September-October this year</a>, which is awfully close to start introducing changes.<br/>
<br/>
An exact launch date is currently unknown, but both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/18/foldable-iphone-manufacturing-2025-start/">Kuo</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/">Pu</a> say mass production is planned for the second half of 2026. <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman has also said he expects the device to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/">launched next year</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/26/foldable-iphone-dual-rear-camera-rumor/">Foldable iPhone Leak Reveals New Camera Details</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-leak-reveals-new-camera-details.2459721/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
