<p>Ukraine says U.S.-brokered trilateral talks with Russia will resume in Abu Dhabi on February 4-5, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying Kyiv is ready for a “substantive discussion” aimed at a “real and dignified end to the war”. The renewed diplomacy comes as fighting continues, including Russian drone attacks reported by Ukrainian officials that caused deaths and injuries and struck civilian infrastructure. Reports also describe severe winter strain on services, with widespread heating and power disruptions in Kyiv after a grid malfunction, highlighting the pressure on civilians as negotiations restart.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ZcCYOl-S1nv1xGTbZN_Gx7GWjbe8dwJ2xth6scqTrZWh-4n2KzMxB0ZuL5Jplwp4sgjaLA2KgBrHYOMgms0w38q77Ha4e1m51yFZPnqkVjaT4X_q1w1phKeF-gdEe12Jr3beIED7ZAGBfeXAQVYsUK0vB1Ynpla6swWdnxfEj6OICF8ropLF9OejNLQDltE_yoQYmeyrS47daZy7iuG9CucBJIAaiWWyspVGO-2ZryWehGVVauPzPC-erAGBCJ5TyxqmrXFlpMbYQpHHDQ' alt='Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks during a joint press conference in Vilnius, Lithuania, Jan. 25, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scheduling shift: Zelenskyy said meetings previously expected Sunday were pushed back, and he had been awaiting clarity from U.S. mediators on timing and venue.</li><li>US-Russia contact: U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said he held “productive and constructive” discussions in Florida with Kremlin representative Kirill Dmitriev ahead of the next round.</li><li>Sticking point: Multiple reports say territory—particularly the Donbas—remains central to the impasse, with Ukraine rejecting Moscow’s demands to cede more land.</li><li>Energy disruption: Ukraine’s energy minister said a technical malfunction affecting lines linking Ukraine and Moldova triggered cascading outages and automatic protection shutdowns, leaving large parts of Kyiv without heat after a broader grid failure.</li><li>US attendance unclear: RT cited U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio as saying U.S. negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner would not attend the next Abu Dhabi round, though “there might be a US presence”.</li></ul><blockquote>Ukraine is ready for a substantive discussion, and we are interested in ensuring that the outcome brings us closer to a real and dignified end to the war. - Volodymyr Zelenskyy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine (President Volodymyr Zelenskyy): Ukraine says it is ready for a substantive discussion and wants talks to move toward a “real and dignified end” to the war.
