Some walking, some writing, some Emacs tweaking. A+ and I went to a pottery wheel workshop. That was nice. My eyes have been dry lately, so I've been using eye drops.

“One of the consequences of his unique approach to writing is the many
digressions present in the Essais. And with many, I mean a great deal of
'em. Most, if not all, essays only mention the topic&#x2014;as supposedly
made apparent to the reader via the title&#x2014;in passing. Bakewell picks
out an example: About chariots. The text starts with a digression on
writing, sways over to the very compelling subject of sneezing only to
land on the actual topic two pages later to then to drift off again onto
a summary of recent happenings in the New World.”

Intentional friction: slow down and add context (your why) for tasks and
notes. I like this because it makes it easier to pick things up again
and actually do something about it. Related thought: turning books into
action items
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Someone else then advised to add context: why did you record this, or
why do you think this might be important? If you can't write that down,
then don't save it. This is added friction: constantly aiming to reduce
friction is not always beneficial to your system. We still have the
habit to collect too much stuff and do too little with it. This seemed
to be a shared struggle among attendants and speakers alike.”

<p>
And these digital files take a different kind of stewardship. The
density of information per cubic inch of material is mind-boggling. Yet
that density of information exists invisible to our analogue self, we
need wizardry to make it visible and hopefully known. This density and
invisibility, I suspect, makes it easy to lose and misplace and
disregard.

</p>

<p>
Learning the terminology is an important step that people struggle with.
Communities help with that.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Just as an example: I've realized that when I'm studying a problem, I
rely a lot on “second-order Googling”. That's a process whereby I don't
try to discover a solution in a single search. Instead, in my first few
searches, I just try to find other people talking about the problem
area, using my own naïve description of the task at hand.
</p>

<p>
	Then, once I discover some conversations that are taking place among
people experienced in that domain, I read over them looking for the
specific terminology that I had missed. Once I have the terminology, I'm
able to use it to compose much more focused searches that usually lead
me directly to the answer I'm looking for.

<p>
It struck me the other day that there is probably more variation and
diversity among different users' Emacs configurations than among the
configurations of any other editor. Users are able to change almost any
aspect of the way that Emacs functions, with easy access to clear
documentation explaining how it works right now, and how you can change
it. This means that each instance of Emacs ends up a unique shape, like
an old tool with a wooden handle worn down into the shape of its owners'
habitual grasp. That simile doesn't quite work, because Emacs users work
hard and deliberately to shape their Emacs tools to fit their needs, so
it is more than just passive wear.

<p>
Jordan Grumet, the guest on the podcast, addresses this worry. He
distinguishes between big P Purpose and little p purpose. Purpose with a
big P is the one that gets me, and apparently a lot of people, stressed.
It feels like, “Why am I here? What am I meant to do?” It induces
anxiety if we want to find Purpose but don't know where to look. Little
p purpose, though, does not ask “why?”; it doesn't examine the reason
for our existence. Instead it asks, “what lights you up?”

The solitary is one who is aware of solitude in himself as a basic and

isolated individual. Hence his solitude is the foundation of a deep,
pure and gentle sympathy with all other men, whether or not they are
capable of realizing the tragedy of their plight.

On Virginia Woolf:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In Moments of Being (public library) &#x2014; the posthumous collection of
her autobiographical writings &#x2014; she writes:
</p>

<p>
A great part of every day is not lived consciously. One walks, eats,
sees things, deals with what has to be done; the broken vacuum cleaner;
ordering dinner; writing orders to Mabel; washing; cooking dinner;
bookbinding. When it is a bad day the proportion of non-being is much
larger.
</p>

<p>
In her 1925 novel Mrs. Dalloway &#x2014; part love letter to these moments of
being, part lamentation about the proportion of non-being we choose
without knowing we are choosing &#x2014; she locates the key to righting the
ratio in “the power of taking hold of experience, of turning it round,
slowly, in the light.”

A+ and I both have strong interest-based focus, which means classwork
might be tricky. Fortunately, I can use my interest in helping her grow
to help me Learn All the Things so I can advocate for her and help her
figure out her brain. Might be ADHD, might be something else, but it's
probably a good idea to work with it instead of trying to squish it into
something that it's not.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Given that high trait curiosity might be a strength in ADHD,
interventions could focus on harnessing this natural tendency rather
than trying to suppress it.
</p>

<p>
For instance, AI-assisted tools have shown promise in providing
personalized learning experiences for individuals with ADHD, allowing
them to engage with material in ways that capitalize on their natural
curiosity. Game-based learning has also demonstrated positive effects on
engagement and interest, particularly in subjects like mathematics. The
Montessori classroom model, which is designed to foster curiosity, has
shown promising results&#x2014;students with ADHD in Montessori settings
exhibit more actively engaged on-task behaviors compared to traditional
classroom settings. Lastly, outdoor socially-oriented activities have
been associated with higher levels of curiosity.

This quote resonated:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But parents have messed up view of what emotional support is, because
parents want gold stars for parenting. So the support most parents give
is to steer the kid to get gold stars. Parents mistake helping a kid get
gold stars for helping a kid feel loved."

<p>
Our kid is 9, bored at school, and procrastinates homework. I know what
that's like because I was like that too. (I think she's doing better
than I did.) I've been working on fretting less. Pushing her to get the
work done and check those checkboxes might not be in her best interest
anyhow.
