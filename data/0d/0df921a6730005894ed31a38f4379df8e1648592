<p>&#8220;Let us take a typical case. A gentleman and his wife, calling on friends, find them not at home. The gentleman decides to leave a note of regret couched in a few well-chosen words, and the first thing he knows he is involved in this:</p>
<p><em>We would have liked to have found you in.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Reading it over, the gentleman is assailed by the suspicion that he has too many &#8216;haves,&#8217; and that the whole business has somehow been put too far into the past. &#8230; He takes an envelope out of his pocket and grimly makes a list of all the possible combinations, thus getting:&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We would have liked to have found</em></li>
<li><em>We would have liked to find</em></li>
<li><em>We would like to have found</em></li>
<li><em>We would like to find</em></li>
<li><em>We had hoped to have been able to have found</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;If he has married the right kind of woman, she will hastily scratch a brief word on a calling card, shove it under the door, and drag her husband away.&#8221;</p>
