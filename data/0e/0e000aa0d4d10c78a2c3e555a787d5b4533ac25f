<p>Now I am appreciating the power and simplicity of ripgrep and have it available on all my systems I was hunting around emacs to see the best way to leverage this tool for quick file searching.</p>
<p>Working on a code base that is familiar to me is fine when locating files within emacs as of course I know where to go and when I am not I would typically open up a terminal and use <code>find</code></p>
<p>As we know, <code>find</code> can be a little picky and fiddly to use and it is not a straightforward process to define the files and folders I am not interested in when returning an efficient search.</p>
<p>Now I have defined an <strong>.ignore</strong> file to define which files and directories I am not interested in for a regular ripgrep I was wondering if I could also use this somehow to search for files within a project hierarchy and from within emacs.</p>
<p>I have heard good things about projectile and in combination with a completion system it can bring up a searchable file list. This seems like a good solution but unfortunately I have never really found it fits in with my simple workflow, I have always failed to set it up properly and generally I don&rsquo;t require the ability to switch between projects.</p>
<p>After running <code>list-packages</code> and literally searching for ripgrep, I came across a package called <strong>find-file-rg</strong>, which leverages the <code>rg --files</code> command to list all files in the directory defined but excluding from the ripgrep defined .ignore file.</p>
<p>Fed into Ivy it means a list of potential files can be displayed and located using its completion system and all I need to define is the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(global-set-key [f4] <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;find-file-rg</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and hey presto!</p>
