The 3D games will be streamed in the forthcoming Spectrum SportsNet app on the Vision Pro, starting early next year, according to Apple. A schedule will be shared later this year. A subscription to a Spectrum internet plan or Spectrum SportsNet+ is needed to watch the live broadcasts, and visionOS 26 or later is also required.<br/>
<br/>
The live broadcasts are only available within Lakers broadcasting territory, which includes Southern California, parts of Southern Nevada, and Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/apple-vision-pro/tanc09caabb3/visionos">Apple Immersive</a> videos are 180-degree 8K recordings, captured with Spatial Audio.<br/>
<br/>
"Viewers will feel the intensity of each game as if they were courtside, with perspectives impossible to capture in traditional broadcasts," says Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Immersive footage of the games will be captured with Blackmagic Design's new URSA Cine Immersive Live camera, which will be available for purchase next year.<br/>
<br/>
Full game replays and highlights in the Apple Immersive format will be available on demand in both the Spectrum SportsNet and NBA apps on the Vision Pro, one to three days after the conclusion of each game, according to Apple.<br/>
