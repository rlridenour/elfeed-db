<p>A tail behind, a trunk in front,<br />
Complete the usual elephant.<br />
The tail in front, the trunk behind,<br />
Is what you very seldom find;</p>
<p>If you for specimens should hunt<br />
With trunks behind and tails in front,<br />
That hunt would occupy you long;<br />
The force of habit is so strong.</p>
<p>&#8212; A.E. Housman</p>
