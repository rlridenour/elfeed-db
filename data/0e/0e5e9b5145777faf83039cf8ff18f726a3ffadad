<p id="p2"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661719/amazon-app-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-kindle-buy-books" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Andrew Liszewski at The Verge</a>, Amazon has updated the Kindle app to add a &ldquo;Get Book&rdquo; button, a direct result of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-breach-of-trust-apple-held-in-contempt-over-app-store-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer">last week&rsquo;s contempt order</a> entered by Judge Gonzalez Rodgers. When tapped, it takes users to the Amazon page for the book in Safari with the Kindle version selected. Before today&rsquo;s update, you couldn&rsquo;t purchase a book without going to Safari first.</p>
<p id="p3">In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661719/amazon-app-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-kindle-buy-books" rel="noopener noreferrer">a low key statement to The Verge</a> over email, Amazon&rsquo;s Tim Gillman said:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  We regularly make improvements to our apps to help ensure we are providing customers the most convenient experience possible. By selecting &lsquo;Get Book&rsquo; within the Kindle for iOS app, customers can now complete their purchase through their mobile web browser.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">I expect <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/developers-and-platforms-react-as-app-store-rules-change-in-the-u-s/" rel="noopener noreferrer">other companies will follow</a> Amazon and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/05/03/spotify-app-adds-support-for-direct-purchases-payments-after-court-mandate" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify&rsquo;s</a> leads in the coming weeks. Although <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/apple-will-appeal-contempt-ruling-epic-games-case-over-app-store-2025-05-05/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple has appealed</a> Judge Gonzalez Rodgers&rsquo; contempt order, the Judge declined to stay its enforcement during the appeals process. It&rsquo;s always possible an appeal could force Amazon and others to undo changes like this, but I think a more likely outcome is that an appellate court allows Apple to charge a fee where Judge Gonzalez Rodgers wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; one that&rsquo;s lower than the 27% that got Apple into trouble in the first place.</p>
