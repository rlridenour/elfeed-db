<p>A special court in Dhaka has sentenced Bangladesh’s ousted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to five years in prison and her niece, British Labour MP and ex-UK minister Tulip Siddiq, to two years over allegations linked to a government land allocation scheme near the capital. Judge Rabiul Alam ruled that Hasina abused her authority as prime minister by approving plots for Siddiq’s mother, brother and sister, while Siddiq was found to have improperly used her political influence to secure the plots for her family. Siddiq, who was tried in absentia and remains in London, strongly denies wrongdoing, calling the proceedings a “flawed and farcical” or “kangaroo court” process and saying prosecutors never formally put the allegations to her during any investigation. Legal experts in the UK and Siddiq’s supporters describe the case as politically motivated amid a wider wave of prosecutions against Hasina and her relatives since she was ousted and fled Bangladesh last year, while Bangladeshi authorities frame it as part of an anti-corruption drive.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ncF_kf7krFe1cytVWmfD-E2CiFzIZikohC4QEGsdeQuBHXXsEKilBf108v-AERJ-DLQAvc2gfzcr63zVrRQi26klgnd33w08vsLZaIqIfLCX-6ZxAm8r4Q2Kig8ktBiH8uwe4f0FFOv71Z9wToIQKKatFQttSHPfnSZWV8ZHPw' alt='Former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina appears on screen as a Dhaka court announces corruption verdicts involving her and British MP Tulip Siddiq.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Sentence details: Sheikh Hasina received a five-year prison term, while Tulip Siddiq’s two-year sentence also includes fines imposed on multiple family members who obtained land under the disputed government project.</li><li>Nature of land project: The case centres on a government housing scheme on the outskirts of Dhaka, where prosecutors say plots were allocated to Siddiq’s close relatives after Hasina approved their applications.</li><li>UK political consequences: Siddiq resigned as a UK Treasury minister in January after media scrutiny of whether she benefited from her family’s rule in Bangladesh, stating she did not want to distract the government.</li><li>Criticism from UK lawyers: A group of senior British legal figures, including former justice secretary Robert Buckland, former attorney general Dominic Grieve and human-rights lawyer Cherie Blair, publicly argued the Bangladeshi trial appeared contrived and did not meet fair-trial standards.</li><li>Likelihood of enforcement: Because Siddiq is based in London and holds a safe parliamentary seat, reporters note she is unlikely to be extradited or serve the Bangladeshi sentence under current circumstances.</li></ul><blockquote>Continuing to smear my name to score political points is both baseless and damaging - Tulip Siddiq</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Tulip Siddiq: She insists she has “done nothing wrong” and calls the proceedings a &quot;kangaroo court&quot; as well as “flawed and farcical,” arguing the allegations are politically driven and were never properly put to her by investigators.
