<p>I do love it when I <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/576">reference Dr. Drang on Upgrade</a> and he responds with <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2025/08/kayaking/">an entire blog post</a>:</p>

  As Jason said on the show, he’d probably need a kayak that’s a bit bigger and more stable than mine because of the choppier water he’d encounter in his bay. While I’ve been out on windy spring days when the waves were a foot high and had whitecaps—yes, even on the relatively small lakes around here—it’s unusual for me to see much chop.

<p>It’s about a mile (less if I walk) from my house to a boat dock I could use to kayak on the bay. So tempting, and I’ve loved it every time I’ve done it, but the logistics always get in the way. I love that Dr. Drang has found a fold-up kayak he can put in his Toyota, but I’m not sure if I can do the same for the rougher water in the bay.</p>
<p>Paddling regularly on the bay remains an ambition of mine. It seems wasteful to be so close and not to take advantage.</p>
