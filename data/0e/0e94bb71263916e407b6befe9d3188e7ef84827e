<p>Climate monitoring groups and researchers say 2025 finished as the world’s third-warmest year in modern records, continuing a long stretch of exceptionally hot years. While global average temperatures eased slightly from the record highs of 2024, scientists said the broader warming trend continues as greenhouse-gas emissions keep adding heat to the climate system. Several reports said they do not expect meaningful “respite” in 2026, meaning communities should prepare for continued heat-related extremes and climate risks worldwide.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ZwSFccjKOdH6zn71k6SPuDWQTFgu6zPVV2I_pHgNAN-OLQECmP0fezNzCH5mU-az3yudfv7xMziMDwnZutWcw60GVHO8622YmzppnrTZj876JoVRr_CEoKp1Ls8mcDaqHf2pjA550stvbTGaZLGRlyWe0M14_fdcC0pP0jd5LxRw5xB-ihc33RRYrd2-WgwafxRoKGoTIuLAqxSeApfMRCJwjjgxVVYEqlQnsDtIUtrnhTbhO4m2FBQzFw' alt='The wind whips up embers as the Palisades fire burns during a windstorm on the west side of Los Angeles, California, on January 7, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Paris threshold: Data cited by researchers indicate the three-year period from 2023–2025 averaged above the Paris Agreement’s 1.5C benchmark, underscoring how close the world is operating to that level even before long-term averaging is applied.</li><li>Vulnerable regions: Reports highlighted that developing countries face disproportionate danger because many communities lack adequate protection from flooding, wildfires and extreme heat.</li><li>India signals: India experienced its warmest winter in more than a century in 2025, according to the national meteorological department cited in coverage.</li><li>Year-in-pictures: A visual roundup documented how 2025’s climate impacts showed up across regions through heat, drought, storms and deadly floods, illustrating both risks and day-to-day adaptation efforts.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>EU Copernicus Climate Change Service: Copernicus ranked 2025 as the third-hottest year and said the past 11 years were the warmest on record, with little sign of near-term cooling.
