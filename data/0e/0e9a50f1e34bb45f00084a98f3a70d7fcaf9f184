It&rsquo;s Monday. Most of us are looking around bleary eyed wondering what happened to the weekend that just started. Here&rsquo;s a little humor to get you warmed up for what&rsquo;s to come. Over at the Emacs subreddit, bruchieOP posts the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1jhjgnu/the_book_of_the_church_of_emacs_satirical_ten/">Ten Commandments of the Church of Emacs</a>.

<p>
It&rsquo;s a satirical look at the beliefs that most of us Emacs users hold near and dear. Note that <i>satirical</i> qualifier. For example, lots of people use and swear by &ldquo;pre-configured distributions&rdquo;, such as Doom and Spacemacs, as even bruchieOP acknowledges. Still, most of you will identify and agree the majority of the prescriptions.

Take a couple of minutes to enjoy the post and then back to work. Emacs is waiting.</p>
