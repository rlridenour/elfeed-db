Starting in 2026, Apple plans to change the release cycle for its flagship <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup, according to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles">The Information</a></em>. Apple will release the more expensive &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18 Pro models in the fall, delaying the release of the standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18 until the spring.<br/>

The shift may be because Apple plans to debut a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in 2026, which will join the existing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup. The fall release will include the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18 Pro, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18 Pro Max, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18 Air, and the new foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Later, in spring 2027, Apple will release the standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18 and an updated version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>. The less expensive &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models will undergo manufacturing trials in India as Apple expands efforts to reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing.<br/>
<br/>
Shifting the release schedule will make it easier for Apple to manage an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup that has six devices instead of five, as <em>The Information</em> suggests that a staggered launch would cut down on the number of manufacturing workers that Apple needs to employ at one time.<br/>

The 2026 Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models could have under-display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> for the first time, with the hardware needed for facial recognition embedded underneath the display. A pinhole would remain for the front-facing camera.<br/>

The foldable 2026 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will have a book-style design with a 5.7-inch outer display when closed and an inner display close to eight inches when open.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/apple-split-iphone-launch-strategy/">Apple Plans Split iPhone Launch Strategy: Pro and Foldable in Fall 2026, Standard in Spring 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-plans-split-iphone-launch-strategy-pro-and-foldable-in-fall-2026-standard-in-spring-2027.2456436/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
