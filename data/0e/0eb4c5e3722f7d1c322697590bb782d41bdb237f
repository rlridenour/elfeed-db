<p>A drone strike hit the Khor Mor gas field in Iraq’s semi‑autonomous Kurdistan Region on Thursday, damaging storage tanks, starting a fire and forcing production to be suspended, according to operator Dana Gas and regional officials. The interruption sharply reduced natural gas supply to nearby power stations, triggering widespread electricity cuts that affected a large share of the Kurdish region’s grid. Authorities in Iraq’s Kurdistan Region said they were working with Dana Gas, a United Arab Emirates–based company, to investigate the attack and restore operations safely. Local officials also reported that several workers were injured in the incident, while emergency crews moved in quickly to bring the blaze under control.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/05zWmUWlejhCiBsF2sgL3mDN2Knll9eAAQiO6KFEUo_OH6bXu-F-0uIFhD4DQ60O9cf40APTpt5nIW6dW1rcB7hey4DyGt028l_TVnU7KPwA0_wQh2fTLdQhhJaktWRnJ-1KRE7yceFOd_HZM9GLgx9Z79dOaiVGDT2D2vJbrE26TrsS' alt='Facilities at Iraq’s Khor Mor gas field in the Kurdistan Region, where a drone strike damaged storage infrastructure and disrupted supplies.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of disruption: Kurdish electricity officials estimated that the loss of gas from Khor Mor could cut regional power generation capacity by roughly 3,000 megawatts, highlighting the field’s central role in meeting local demand.</li><li>Grid dependence: Reports indicated that the shutdown disrupted around four‑fifths of the Kurdistan Region’s power grid, underscoring how reliant local electricity production has become on this single gas complex.</li><li>Joint operation: Khor Mor is jointly operated by UAE‑based Dana Gas and its affiliate Crescent Petroleum, which supply processed gas from the field to power plants feeding cities across northern Iraq.</li><li>Ongoing investigation: Regional authorities said security services and technical teams were inspecting the impact site and coordinating with Dana Gas engineers to assess structural damage and determine when partial operations might safely resume.</li><li>Worker safety response: Following reports that several workers were injured when the drone struck the storage area, site management activated emergency protocols, evacuated non‑essential staff and called in firefighting units to contain the blaze.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Kurdistan Regional Authorities: Regional officials emphasised that they were coordinating closely with Dana Gas to investigate the circumstances of the strike and to stabilise power supply by bringing the facility back online once it is deemed secure.
