<p>Turkey’s maritime authority says a Russian-flagged tanker carrying sunflower oil from Russia to Georgia reported being hit by a drone roughly 80 miles off the Turkish Black Sea coast on Tuesday, the third strike on a commercial tanker in the area in recent days. The ship, identified as the Midvolga 2, sustained damage but its 13 crew members were unharmed, did not request assistance, and continued under its own power toward the Turkish port of Sinop. Earlier attacks targeted two Gambian-flagged tankers near Turkey’s coast, which Ukrainian media sources described as a joint operation by Ukraine’s security service and navy, and a Ukrainian source also claimed that previous Russian-linked vessels were secretly transporting oil rather than the agricultural goods listed. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has described the tanker strikes near his country’s shores as a “worrying escalation” and has criticized Ukraine for the drone operations, warning that further incidents risk destabilizing Black Sea navigation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ovnG_G_9mJj2Mw29ROikMhtFs78l1hNTxnUhJ1YJAhNJ00McSiaUigObI7mbm7iqP905e9g5ryV79WRQ2irkXnsxFZkZ3NgRIfkVnMch1KC7zCk2RmGBUfx1XeHsBvHagSpBeL8fuEbZJR6ZJBoYGuslNDQqR7EszvcWukarpA' alt='A tanker sails in the Black Sea off the Turkish coast, where several commercial vessels have recently reported drone attacks.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Cargo details: Turkish officials and Russian maritime authorities say the Midvolga 2 was loaded with sunflower oil en route from a Russian port to Georgia when it reported the drone incident north of Turkey’s Black Sea coast.</li><li>Crew outcome: Despite the strike, authorities in Turkey reported no injuries or other adverse conditions among the 13 people on board and said the crew chose to continue sailing rather than ask for help.</li><li>Previous tanker strikes: In the days before the Midvolga 2 incident, sea drones packed with explosives hit two Gambian-flagged tankers, Kairos and Virat, off Turkey’s Black Sea coast, marking the start of this series of commercial-ship attacks.</li><li>Ukrainian attribution claims: Ukrainian media sources, cited by Russian and Turkish reporting, linked earlier tanker strikes to a joint operation by Ukraine’s security service and navy, and a Ukrainian source told French media the targeted vessels were suspected of clandestinely carrying Russian oil.</li><li>Russian condemnation: Moscow has previously denounced attacks on tankers and port infrastructure in the region as “terrorist” acts against civilian shipping, after a suspected Ukrainian drone also struck a crude export hub on Russia’s Black Sea coast run by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Turkish government: Turkey’s president has called the drone strikes on Russian tankers near his country’s Black Sea shoreline a worrying escalation and criticized Ukraine for launching these operations so close to Turkish waters.
