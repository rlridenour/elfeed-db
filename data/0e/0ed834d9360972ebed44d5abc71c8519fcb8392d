<p>Setting Emacs up to use your system trash can potentially save your bacon if you mistakenly delete a file, say from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html">dired</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the trash safety net also extends to other Emacs areas. For example, discarding files from <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a> (via <code>magit-discard</code>) becomes a recoverable operation. As an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html">eshell</a> user, the trash can also help you recover from <code>rm</code> blunders.</p>

<p>You can enable macOS system trash in Emacs by setting <code>trash-directory</code> along with defining <code>system-move-file-to-trash</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(setq trash-directory &quot;~/.Trash&quot;)

;; See `trash-directory' as it requires defining `system-move-file-to-trash'.
(defun system-move-file-to-trash (file)
  &quot;Use \&quot;trash\&quot; to move FILE to the system trash.&quot;
  (cl-assert (executable-find &quot;trash&quot;) nil &quot;'trash' must be installed. Needs \&quot;brew install trash\&quot;&quot;)
  (call-process &quot;trash&quot; nil 0 nil &quot;-F&quot;  file))
</code></pre>
