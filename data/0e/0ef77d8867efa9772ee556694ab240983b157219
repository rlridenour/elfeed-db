<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> One starts at &#36;19.99 per month for up to three products, with the ability to add more for &#36;5.99 per month for each additional device. The plan incudes all of the benefits that come with &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+, such as unlimited repairs for accidents, priority support, battery coverage, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Subscribers can freely move their devices in and out of the plan at any time. &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; One also enables users to add products they already own that are up to four years old, providing they are in good condition, extending beyond the current 60-day window to purchase &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+. When a customer trades in a covered product with Apple, it is automatically removed from their &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; One plan and replaced with the new device. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; One also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/23/applecare-with-theft-loss-for-ipad-apple-watch/">expands theft and loss protection</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Apple Watch. Previously, it was only available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; One's pricing is the same regardless of the products that are covered. Apple says that a customer who enrolls their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and Apple Watch could save up to &#36;11 per month versus enrolling in separate &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+ plans for each device.<br/>
<br/>
