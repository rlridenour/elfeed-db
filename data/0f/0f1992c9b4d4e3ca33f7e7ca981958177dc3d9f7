<em><strong>Building Robust Networks of Trust in the Anthropocene<br />
</strong>This project aims to inform an evaluation of discourse about global warming. Social media data will be collected to construct an international network that discusses global warming. Using both social network analysis (clustering, identification of central nodes) and natural language processing to identify climate skeptics and anti-immigrant sentiment, the project examines trust-related language in the network, enabling tracking of changes in discourse, identification of vectors of mistrust, and collocations of terms, hashtags, and emoji. From this empirical basis, interventions to foster better patterns of trust will be proposed. This will result in better policies and regulations for social media communication about controversial topics.<br />

<em><strong>New Causal Foundations for Space and Time</strong></em><br />
<em>The project aims to solve a philosophical problem arising from physics. Recent developments suggest space and time don’t exist at certain scales. This poses a serious conceptual challenge: scientific experiments usually happen in space and time and so when these are missing we have no idea what experimentation means. Drawing on methods from philosophy, the project will explore causation as a replacement for space and time in our conceptual framework for science. The expected outcome is a seed-bank of models that philosophers and scientists can use to study nature. Anticipated benefits include generating new knowledge in philosophy, strengthening international collaboration and enhancing interdisciplinary research capacity in Australia.<br />

<em><strong>The Moral Significance of Being Human</strong></em><br />
<em>This Fellowship aims to explain and justify the moral significance of being human. This will be done through the development of an original philosophical framework, focused on addressing three critical challenges: human rights, aged care, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The resulting framework will enable the generation of new knowledge about the foundations of human rights; which practices constitute dehumanisation; and what separates humans from AI. Expected outcomes of the project include advances in philosophical theorising; enhanced research capacity, through the development of an Early Career Researcher Network; and cross-disciplinary collaborations.<br />
