<p>Australia is introducing a world-first nationwide ban on social media accounts for children under 16, with enforcement beginning on 10 December and expanding to cover major platforms including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube after a government review. The government says the policy aims to protect young people from what it describes as &quot;predatory&quot; recommendation algorithms and an online &quot;purgatory&quot; of addictive content, citing concerns over mental health and harmful material. YouTube initially argued it should be exempt because it is primarily a video and educational platform rather than a social network, and warned the law could remove parental control features and make children less safe online, but has now said it will comply after the ban’s scope was broadened to include it. Communications minister Anika Wells has rejected the company’s warnings as &quot;outright weird&quot; and stressed that all platforms are now on notice to adapt their services for Australian children in line with the new age rules.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/vaQOmn5kSC6orfTJv61kfuelc0CVrelq2vejBg7uz2P8-Qcv8dRMBKsJ96kz6_6qTmVcgeYaOUavpkAxnzTVFT1fo9bkppQ4a1eec6Mx1LmK5JHyrFNOLUttxeTGZVjWBjyziBDJdAGbI7CMNxw-JoCYhz60gvfg5D8R_v7x-DOMIX8X80kjIs9WJ4ojGRRNkDNSGn4hVTyQN_bnaygT_ihIbyyiUF_6ERh3dNiW5y4rEeWrQBAOJD_9IsbIeY6FqlX7rgpCwj01iUThWRWZvYn6Fk0A8o--02JuyMW69eh8Xw' alt='YouTube’s interface displayed on multiple screens as Australia prepares to enforce an under-16 social media ban.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ban’s coverage: The Australian rules apply to a &quot;raft&quot; of globally popular platforms and websites, including Meta’s services, TikTok, YouTube and newer apps such as Lemon8, which has said it will also restrict its Australian users to over-16s.</li><li>Age verification burden: Platforms operating in Australia will need systems capable of reliably determining whether users are under 16, after the government expanded the ban’s scope so that services framed as video or educational tools could not sidestep the rules.</li><li>YouTube safety tools: YouTube has warned that the new law will remove its ability to offer supervised experiences and content restrictions for children’s accounts in Australia, which it says could undermine existing child-safety measures on the service.</li><li>Government’s youth focus: Australian officials say the measures are designed to protect Generation Alpha from being drawn into constant scrolling and harmful material, arguing that limiting early exposure will support healthier development for teenagers.</li><li>Rollout timeframe: Officials caution it may take weeks after 10 December for the restrictions to function on every platform, but say the law clearly signals that companies must reconfigure their services for younger Australians.</li></ul><blockquote>We will comply with the law, but we’re concerned it won’t keep teens safer online - Google spokesperson</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Australian federal government: The government argues the ban is needed to protect under-16s from harmful and addictive online experiences driven by &quot;predatory&quot; algorithms and to prevent young people spending large parts of their lives in an online &quot;purgatory&quot; of endless feeds..
