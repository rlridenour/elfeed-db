Using bufler1 and selectrum2 to navigate browser buffers concisely.
Firefox plugin Because one of exwm greatest benefits is using emacs&rsquo; in-built buffer methods for navigation, it is handy to include the address of any website in its title so the buffer can be found by just searching, e.g., &ldquo;slack&rdquo;. For this reason the misleadingly named &ldquo;KeePass Helper&quot;3 is tremendously useful. Now I can easily select my buffers with a random-access method off a portion of the URL.
