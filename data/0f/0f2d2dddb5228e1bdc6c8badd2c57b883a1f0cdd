&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; will be available as an app accessible through the vehicle's built-in infotainment system, making it available for those who do not use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>. Using the app requires an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription.<br/>
<br/>
Volvo is equipping the EX60 with its HuginCore system that integrates AI and technology developed by Google, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. Gemini is deeply integrated in the vehicle, allowing the car to be controlled with natural language commands.<br/>
<br/>
While the EX60 has deep Google Gemini integration, it continues to support &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;. Volvo says that Wireless Apple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; comes standard on the EX60, with users able to connect their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to the car's infotainment system to access Apple apps, music, and navigation.<br/>
<br/>
The EX60 also includes digital key plus, so it can be unlocked and turned on with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Volvo is selling the EX60 in European markets starting now, and US availability will follow in the spring. Orders will be delivered starting in summer.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/volvo-ex60-apple-music-app/">Volvo&#039;s New EX60 SUV Features Pre-Installed Apple Music App With Spatial Audio</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/volvos-new-ex60-suv-features-pre-installed-apple-music-app-with-spatial-audio.2476397/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
