<p>Humans don’t all perceive the same temperature in the same way. When it’s <span class="small-caps">19˚C</span> (<span class="small-caps">66˚F</span>) in the house I’m all rugged up because it feels almost arctic to me, while other family members are quite happy going around in summer clothing.</p>
<p>This principle occurs in other areas of life as well, such as whether the tv volume is too soft or too loud, and whether food is too spicy or not.</p>
<p>Successfully getting along with other people takes work, and usually starts with putting ourselves in their shoes while discussing strategies to help everyone feel as comfortable as possible.</p>
