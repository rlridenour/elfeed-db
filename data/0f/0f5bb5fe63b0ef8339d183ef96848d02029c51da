</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Not all of the books of the year, but an overview of the ones that stuck out.
</p>
        <p>This year, my partner and I are participating as a team in our local library
reading “challenge.”  The goal is for the team to read 100 books.  Thusfar we’ve
read 150 or so books; me having read about 50 and my partner over a 100.</p>
<p>What have been the stand-out books?  And more importantly, why?  Not all of
these are ones that I very much enjoyed (e.g. a 4 out of 4 rating), but they are
ones that stuck with me.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><cite data-id="fee4ffa7-1d45-46e7-86f1-af203b92f54b">Aflame</cite> by Pico Iyer:</strong> a flowing memoir of solitude and retreat so as to
re-engage with the world.  To find energy and capacity in quiet communion
with both others and nature.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="817193e6-0ae6-4183-9c1b-87733e8a7eca">Annihilation</cite> by Jeff Vandermeer:</strong> we listened to this audiobook throughout
a single day.  And found ourselves wondering what was happening.  The richness
of language and imagery paired with withheld information drew me in.  Leaving
me both wondering while also knowing that I won’t find out.  Much like I won’t
know how “climate change” or “history” <em>ends</em> .</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="ISBN-9780199567690">Babbitt</cite> by Sinclair Lewis:</strong> a book written in the 1920s that seems almost
immediately applicable to 2020s; plus this was part of a community read, so I
had a fantastic conversation with community members.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="ISBN-9781250776297">Bea Wolf</cite> by Zach Weinersmith:</strong> I love reading Beowulf, each time a new
translation.  And this one, while not a translation, is instead a retelling
that brought me absolute child-like joy.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="fb15e51e-3050-4d09-ab79-f6b6b1f916a8">Being Peace</cite> by Thich Nhat Hanh:</strong> it had been years since I read a Thich Nhat
Hanh book, and this was a natural read after <cite data-id="fee4ffa7-1d45-46e7-86f1-af203b92f54b">Aflame</cite>.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="ISBN-9781644452110">Black and Female</cite> by Tsitsi Dangarembga:</strong> these essays hit home the absolute
vileness of apartheid, as applied in South Africa, but also in the Jim Crow
era that the present regime is angling to restore and expand.  As an added
bonus, Dangarembga was the first Zimbabwean author that I’ve read.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="f346e9c4-e904-417f-8c4c-4722727d8dd9">The City of Saints and Madmen</cite> by Jeff VanderMeer:</strong> the language and imagery
of <cite data-id="817193e6-0ae6-4183-9c1b-87733e8a7eca">Annihilation</cite> captivated me.  And one day, while waiting for my partner to
finish perusing the bookstore we were visiting, I cracked open the
<cite>Ambergris</cite>omnibus, and started reading <cite>Draden, in Love</cite>.  And found myself immediately transported into the chaotic streets
of Ambergris.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="1254A3B2-19CC-4EA7-AA80-39B70CD21F5D">The Creative Act</cite> by Rick Rubin:</strong> a book to keep on hand, flip through and
find a bit of inspiration.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="87f4018e-a675-44a7-9c95-b1183384affd">The Dispossessed</cite> by Ursula K. Le Guin:</strong> a speculative work on how community
can move past capitalism, yet also understand that it would be hard to fully
escape it, while also knowing that governance is invariably a political and
personal affair.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="c51d973a-21c0-406e-86cd-c334769cfc59">The Empusium</cite> by Olga Tokarczuk:</strong> Tokarczuk writes to expand and enlarge the
past through which we invariably construct and sustain an ever narrowing view.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="252e3dc9-f174-41fe-a10f-7bcb13f6d0d5">The Fellowship of the Ring</cite> by J.R.R. Tolkien:</strong> a
passion project, in which Phil Dragash narrated and voice acted a production
of the <cite data-id="B716B561-9CFB-4712-B247-848A312BE175">The Fellowship of the Ring</cite>.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="55348AB8-9909-4E68-878A-5458701F87E1">Freedom is a Constant Struggle</cite> by Angela Y. Davis:</strong> articulating so clearly
that Palestine, the military industrial complex, petro-carceral state feed
into each other; and have created the conditions in which we find the United
States.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="1779d578-85b3-4c27-881d-a56a4a77dabc">Hope in the Dark</cite> by Rebecca Solnit:</strong> I had trepidation about this; it felt as
though I might be thinking “Oh Sweet Summer Child” of the grim days of yore.
But I instead found this collection of essays a timeless reminder that
unpredictable positive events and situations arise from times of tribulation
and uncertainty.  Importantly, Solnit provides receipts for past achievements
and successes that we may have forgotten.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="ISBN-9781945492600">I Who Have Never Known Men</cite> by Jacqueline Harpman:</strong> a philosophical dystopian
read in which one invariably will think about purpose and meaning of life.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="ISBN-9780385550369">James</cite> by Percival Everett:</strong> a great book in its own right, that
delivers a fantastic additional narrative perspective to the events told by
Huck Finn (himself unreliable).  This book did double duty, rekindling
memories of reading <cite data-id="8EDAF156-FD70-48D5-8E92-D1C675F2C49A">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</cite> and seeing Big River.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="C5494904-CE49-4456-8E29-E3F94B72A593">The Life of Poetry</cite> by Muriel Rukeyser:</strong> such lyricism and exposure to aspects
of history and thought lost in our march to forget the lessons of facing and
overcoming fascism.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="1f28328c-be96-453d-a9a8-9b921c39fd8a">The Little Book of Solitude</cite> by Joost Joossen:</strong> a collection of
mini-biographies and quotes that lead me to to Pico Iyer’s <cite data-id="fee4ffa7-1d45-46e7-86f1-af203b92f54b">Aflame</cite>; it was
also amongst the first library books I checked out from our local library.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="75095d6c-cbe7-4a38-a6da-549678d4ed5e">Men Explain Things to Me</cite> by Rebecca Solnit:</strong> this has been sitting on my
shelf, partially read, and I sat down to read it.  Solnit always provides a
reminder of the misogynistic structures and cultural behaviors that course
through the world in which we live.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite> by Agnes Callard:</strong> as with other philosophy books, this is one
I’ve added a hefty dose of marginalia.  Considering how to better approach
love, death, and politics.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="55a32435-c012-4892-be9a-ac00b5b17204">Piranesi</cite> by Susanna Clarke:</strong> this one will sit with me for a very long-time.
Slow-moving, playing with memory.  I highly recommend reading this in close
proximity to <cite data-id="ISBN-9781945492600">I Who Have Never Known Men</cite>.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="effcc954-310e-4b76-bf18-6919eb075832">The Player of Games</cite> by Iain M. Banks:</strong> an interesting bit of speculation on
how a complex game can be used to constrain a society, and how the rules and
language of the game impose upon the society.  And how diversity can be a
mighty advantage.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="da435b3f-87a2-49bb-802f-acf81815a488">Prairie Songs</cite> by Lauren Friesen:</strong> my uncle wrote this, and I learned a
little bit more about him and my family history.  And my uncles poem about
surviving polio ending with: “and beside my bed \ they spun, \ an iron
cocoon.”  Goosebumps.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="4b6ca2f0-8e70-40b4-b18e-fe87b643b3e6">Pranksters vs. Autocrats</cite> by Srdja Popovic and Sophia A. McClennen:</strong> I have
recommended this book to many people looking for hope and action.  Evidence is
that humor wins.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="C2F8BF31-362C-4F0D-A4F2-8F6B1927CB1A">Slowness</cite> by Milan Kundera:</strong> this was one of my question books, due to its
quote: “There is a secret bond between slowness and memory, between speed and
forgetting.”  I found this book for a reasonable price and read it that
evening.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="588d8c62-e79a-4ffe-99f3-a73aba315a8e">Spring, Summer, Asteroid, Bird</cite> by Henry Lien:</strong> on a lark I picked this up,
and it opened my awareness to other narrative structures, ones that I now look
for as a change of pace.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="isbn-9781534431003">This is How You Lose the Time War</cite> by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone:</strong> Jenny
borrowed this via inter-library loan; read it and thought I might enjoy it.
She was right.  I appreciate the myth building through symbols; the language
of thread, needle felting, and sleeping beauty (herself a wolf hungry for
little red riding hood).</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="5dd8020b-640b-420d-ae24-84169585038c">To Fight Against this Age</cite> by Rob Riemen:</strong> I liked the title and subtitle, and
found a philosophical memoir that reinforced the need for humanism and
conversation.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="d334ef0c-4398-479f-ad82-4d8b9e993d2c">The Trial</cite> by Franz Kafka:</strong> Having never read much of Kafka, yet knowing the
foundational nature of his work, then reading references in <cite data-id="5dd8020b-640b-420d-ae24-84169585038c">To Fight Against this Age</cite> and eyeing <cite data-id="kafka-on-the-shore-by-haruki-murakami">Kafka on the Shore</cite>, I had to read it.  And I was
hooked.  Forget Cthulhu, existential dread is mindless bureaucracy.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="isbn-9781250213587">Upright Women Wanted</cite> by Sarah Gailey:</strong> not normally something I’d read, but
this let the Wild West tropes do quite a bit of work, and then subvert those
tropes and tell a unique story about resistance.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="BAEA3D15-DA6C-4699-9DCC-3F424B515740">We</cite> by Yevgeny Zamyatin:</strong> I love <cite data-id="works-1984">1984</cite>, <cite data-id="30C81F03-C944-488E-9C81-CFC7E632A95E">Brave New World</cite>, and <cite data-id="72C7CC81-C6CD-4ECD-B8AF-EDF939B56094">Farenheit 451</cite>; and <cite data-id="BAEA3D15-DA6C-4699-9DCC-3F424B515740">We</cite> is the spiritual ancestor of those stories.  The dystopian
over-reaching state in which so much energy must be spent to sustain the
systems of oppression and coercion.  It felt a bit derivative, but as it came
before, must be viewed with a freshness of thought relative to others.</li>
<li><strong><cite data-id="95cc0be8-ed94-44c5-a193-696c32426e72">When No Thing Works</cite> by Norma Kaelokū Wong:</strong> an important reminder that it is
not enough to resist, but to imagine a future in which we are along moving
along the path of restoration and restitution.  Naming what that future looks
like—in details.  The dishes one brings to celebrations, the evidence of how
improvements manifest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then synthesizing all of these things: subvert tropes as this fosters further
imagination of possibility.  And from there, action becomes possible.</p>
