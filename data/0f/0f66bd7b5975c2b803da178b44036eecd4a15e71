Apple's next-generation iPhones are less than ten months away and we already have a good idea about what to expect based on corroborated leaks, rumors, and reports from reliable sources. <br/>
<br/>
While the overall design of the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro is expected to remain largely the same as that of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, it could feature translucent or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/11/iphone-18-pro-drop-rear-two-tone-look/">color-matched rear glass</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/12/iphone-18-pro-max-heaviest-iphone-ever/">thicker design</a> to accommodate a bigger battery. Apple is rumored to be testing at least <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/iphone-18-pro-rumored-colors/">three new color options</a> for the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models, including burgundy, brown, and purple, but only one of these is expected to be carried forward to production.<br/>
<br/>
The front of the device is expected to see <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> moved under the display for the first time, resulting in a smaller <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> and potentially a left-aligned punch-hole camera. The front-facing camera is also expected to see a bump up to 24-megapixels.<br/>
<br/>
The main rear camera could receive a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-18-samsung-camera-sensor-report/">three-stack image sensor</a> from Samsung and it is highly likely to get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/27/iphone-18-pro-variable-aperture-camera/">variable aperture</a>. A variable-aperture system physically adjusts the lens opening, letting more light in for low-light shots or narrowing the opening for brighter scenes and deeper depth of field. Apple is also expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/iphone-18-camera-control-capacitive/">"simplify" the Camera Control</a> by removing its capacitive functions, moving it to rely on pressure alone. <br/>
<br/>
It should also sport the A20 Pro chip, which will be Apple's first based on TSMC's 2nm process for enhanced performance and efficiency. A custom <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-18-pro-c2-modem-rumor/">"C2" chip</a> is expected to displace Qualcomm's 5G modem, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/">support for mmWave 5G</a> in the United States.  In addition, Apple apparently plans to add <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/24/iphone-18-pro-full-5g-satellite-internet-rumor/">support for 5G networks</a> that operate via satellites rather than Earth-based towers.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max are expected to debut in the fall of 2026 alongside the first foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18e, &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> 2 are likely to follow in the spring of 2027. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.<br/>
