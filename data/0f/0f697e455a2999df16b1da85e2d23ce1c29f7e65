<p>Started reading the Emacs manual and discovered something that bugged me.</p>
<p>My knowledge of Emacs is bipolar. There are some advanced things that I am comfortable with and there are some basic things which I have no clue about. I know keybindings and how to set them, but I don’t know how to move around a document, the Emacs way.</p>
<p>Move to beginning of a line: <strong>C-a</strong>.<br>
I knew that.<br>
Move to the beginning of a sentence: <strong>M-a</strong>.<br>
I did not.<br>
Move to the end of a sentence: <strong>M-e</strong>.<br>
Did not know this either.</p>
<p>I realized that the gaps in my knowledge requires me to learn a new way to engage with Emacs. This would obviously require practice. If I was going to reinvent the learning curve, why not go whole-hog? That thought lead me to <a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil" target="_blank">evil-mode</a>.</p>
<p>I have heard a lot about VIM keybindings. I don’t know them to any great extent. I am going to learn them and use them in Emacs. You can reasonably ask at this stage: “Why the fuck would you do that?”</p>
<p>The answer is probably:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I like pain. (said in jest, but might be unnervingly accurate)</li>
<li>I am curious. A whole host of people I respect swear by VIM keybindings. They want it everywhere. Every editor I know of has customers who want or use VIM keybindings. Hell there is a program called <a href="https://kindavim.app/" target="_blank">kindaVim</a> which lets you use VIM keybindings almost everywhere in macOS. What is the magic that all of these folks are clamoring for? I am curious.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I installed evil-mode. Turned off god-mode. And a journey begins.</p>
<p>The learning curve just got longer/steeper.</p>
<p>If you break it down, keybindings in Emacs can be grouped into two categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The actual editing of text.</li>
<li>Dealing with Emacs.</li>
</ol>
<p>In evil-mode, the dealing with Emacs activities are improved by using <a href="https://github.com/noctuid/general.el" target="_blank">general.el</a>. Thanks to the modal nature of evil-mode, you can have different keybindings assigned to different modes. Also <strong>spacebar</strong> as the leader key is simply fantastic.</p>
<p>This is my general.el configuration to deal with Emacs. None of this originated from me. I looked at a whole host of config files and came up with this for my use. It is also not set in stone, over time, I intend to customize this to fit my needs better.</p>
