Updated: [2021-09-23 Thu]  comment from Mark  Intro Somewhere back in Emacs&rsquo; memory of text esoterica and ideas that don&rsquo;t seem to have taken off, there is support for ascii page breaks: the idea that within a single text document, &ldquo;pages&rdquo; could be represented by special characters. This is before the dawn of word processors or orgmode or PDF files, and this is an idea that might still be useful for some enterprising archeologist.
