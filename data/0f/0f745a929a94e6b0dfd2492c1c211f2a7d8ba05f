<blockquote><p>
&#8216;The letters in this curious alphabet are all wood, chiefly twisted roots of the blue gum, and have not been altered in any way from their original growth; three girls collected them in their daily walks or rides for a period of six months, and the specimens were found in various places; frequently one was carried home on horseback for many miles. All are about two feet high. The &#8220;B&#8221; was the last found, and when the young ladies had almost despaired of ever getting one it was found in a heap of driftwood caught against a tree in the river.&#8217; &#8212; Miss Cave, Vergemont, Clontreagh, Co. Dublin</p></blockquote>
