The Apple Watch has received some incremental updates in recent years, with significant upgrades becoming fewer and farther between as the device has progressed. Since the Apple Watch's generation-over-generation enhancements are relatively small, it is all the more important to consider when an upgrade is justified and whether an older model could suffice for your needs.<br/>

The Apple Watch Series 11 is one of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-10-vs-series-11/">smallest refreshes</a> in the device's history, but it can still form a good upgrade if coming from an older device where the changes stack up. While all previous Apple Watch models from before the Series 11 have been discontinued, older models may still be found for lower prices from third-party retailers or second-hand.<br/>
<br/>
Read on to see the breakdown below for each new feature, change, and improvement that was added with each Apple Watch model compared to its direct predecessor. Viewing each generation's changes in this way helps weigh up the accumulative upgrades one receives by skipping multiple generations when buying a new device, as well as get a sense of which generations offered the biggest overall upgrades.<br/>

The Apple Watch Series 11 does not provide a meaningful upgrade over the Series 10, and it is barely worth it for Series 9 users either. While it has an older design, the Series 9 offers a brighter display, wrist flick and double tap features, sleep apnea detection, and hypertension detection, as well as the same chip technology, as the subsequent two generations. <br/>
<br/>
Upgrading to the Series 11 starts to be more worth it when coming from a Series 8 or older. However, these users may be better off buying a Series 10 model to save money – the Series 11 is a very minor upgrade over the Series 10. Series 7 users stand to benefit more, gaining features like Crash Detection, and body and water temperature sensing, but the biggest differences will be felt by those with a Series 6 or older. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a> is not supported by the Series 5 or older, so anyone with one of these devices should definitely consider upgrading soon.<br/>
<br/>
Looking to the future, it looks like next year's Apple Watch Series 12 could offer some major upgrades including a redesign, a more powerful chip, new sensors, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>. This could make it a great upgrade for those with a Series 9 or older. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/upgrading-from-older-apple-watch/">Upgrading From an Older Apple Watch?
