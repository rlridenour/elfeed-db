Intended audience: This is a long post (~ 8,400
words). It's mostly for me, but I hope it might
also be interesting if you like to use Emacs to do
complicated things or if you also happen to
organize online conferences.

While organizing EmacsConf 2025, I thought it was
going to be a smaller conference compared to last
year because of lots of last-minute cancellations.
Now that I can finally add things up, I see how it
all worked out:

<p>
EmacsConf 2025 was actually a little longer than 2024 in total presentation time, although that's probably because we had more live talks which included answering questions.
It was almost as long overall including live Q&amp;A in BigBlueButton rooms, but we did end an hour or so earlier each day.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the livestreaming data, I see that we had fewer participants compared to the previous year. Here are the stats from Icecast, the program we use for streaming:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Saturday:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>gen: 107 peak + 7 lowres (compared to 191 in 2024)</li>
<li>dev: 97 peak + 7 lowres (compared to 305 in 2024)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sunday: I forgot to copy Sunday stats, whoops! I think there were about 70 people on the general stream. <mark>Idea:</mark> Automate this next time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The YouTube livestream also had fewer participants at the time of the stream, but that's okay. Here are the stats from YouTube:

Fewer people attended compared to last year, but it's still an amazing get-together from the perspective of being able to get a bunch of Emacs geeks in a (virtual) room. People asked a lot of questions over IRC and the Etherpads, and the speakers shared lots of extra details that we captured in the Q&amp;A sessions. I'm so glad people were able to connect with each other.
</p>

<p>
Based on the e-mails I got from speakers about their presentations and the regrets from people who couldn't make it to EmacsConf, it seemed that people were a lot busier in 2025 compared to 2024. There were also a lot more stressors in people's lives. But it was still a good get-together, and it'll continue to be useful going forward.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLomc4HLgvuCVGgvM1ev1Oh2vSZbFPGl3U">EmacsConf 2025 videos</a> have about 20k views total on YouTube. (media.emacsconf.org doesn't do any tracking.) Here are the most popular ones so far:

<p>
While I was looking at the viewing stats on YouTube, I noticed that people are still looking at videos all the way back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLomc4HLgvuCUGJY-knn_6Ss_lcJ58IlKx">2013</a> (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4bcE_gBJrw">Emacs Live - Sam Aaron</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFClYrhV1z4">Emacs Lisp Development - John Wiegley</a>), and many videos have thousands of views. Here are some of the most popular ones from past conferences:

Views aren't everything, of course, but maybe they let us imagine a little about how many people these speakers might have been able to reach. How wonderful it is that people can spend a few days putting together their insights and then have that resonate with other people through time. Speakers are giving us long-term gifts.

Of course, the process of preparing all of that started long before the days of the conference. We posted the call for proposals towards the end of June, like we usually do, because we wanted to give people plenty of time to start thinking about their presentations. We did early acceptances again this year, and we basically accepted everything, so people could start working on their videos almost right away. Here's the general timeline:

</figure>

<p>
This graph shows that we got more proposals earlier this year (solid blue line: 2025) compared to last year (gray: 2024), although there were fewer last-minute ones and more cancellations this year. Some people were very organized. (Video submissions in August!) Some people sent theirs in later because they first had to figure out all the details of what they proposed, which is totally relatable for anyone who's found themselves <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">shaving Emacs yaks</a> before.
</p>

<p>
I really appreciated the code that I wrote to <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2023/09/emacsconf-backstage-scheduling-with-svgs/">create SVG previews of the schedule</a>. That made it much easier to see how the schedule changed as I added or removed talks. I started stressing out about the gap between the proposals and the uploaded videos (orange) in November. Compared to last year, the submissions slowly trickled in. The size of the gap between the blue line (cumulative proposals) and the orange line (cumulative videos uploaded) was much like my stress level, because I was wondering how I'd rearrange things if most of the talks had to cancel at the last minute or if we were dealing with a mostly-live schedule. Balancing EmacsConf anxiety with family challenges resulted in all sorts of <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/11/tracking-my-oopses/">oopses in my personal life.</a> (I even accidentally shrank my daughter's favourite T-shirt.) It helped to remind myself that we started off as a single-track single-day conference with mostly live sessions, that it's totally all right to go back to that, and that we have a wonderful (and very patient) community. I think speakers were getting pretty stressed too. I reassured speakers that Oct 31 was a soft target date, not a hard deadline. I didn't want to cancel talks just because life got busy for people.
</p>

<p>
It worked out reasonably well. We had enough capacity to process and caption the videos as they came in, even the last-minute uploads. Many speakers did their own captions. We ended up having five live talks. Live talks are generally a bit more stressful for me because I worry about technical issues or other things getting in the way, but all those talks went well, thank goodness.
</p>

<p>
For some reason, Linode doesn't seem to show me detailed accrued charges any more. I think it used to show them before, which is why I managed to write <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/12/emacsconf-2024-notes/">last year's notes</a> in December. If I skip the budget section of these notes, maybe I can post them earlier, and then just follow up once the invoices are out.
</p>

<p>
I think the timeline worked out mostly all right this year. I don't think moving the target date for videos earlier would have made much of a difference, since speakers would probably still be influenced by the actual date of the conference. It's hard to stave off that feeling of pre-conference panic: Do we have enough speakers? Do we have enough videos? But these graphs might help me remember that it's been like that <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2023/10/emacsconf-backstage-looking-at-emacsconf-s-growth-over-5-years-and-how-to-do-pivot-tables-and-graphs-with-org-mode-and-the-python-pandas-library/">before</a> and it has still worked out, so it might just be part of my job as an organizer to embrace the uncertainty. Most conferences do live talks, anyway.

<h3 id="emacsconf-2025-notes-managing-conference-information-in-org">Managing conference information in Org Mode and Emacs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-emacsconf-2025-notes-managing-conference-information-in-org">
<p>
Organizing the conference meant keeping track of lots of e-mails and lots of tasks over a long period of time. To handle all of the moving parts, I relied on Org
Mode in Emacs to manage all the conference-related information.
This year, I switched to mainly using the <a href="https://emacsconf.org/organizers-notebook/">general
organizers notebook</a>, with the <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2025/organizers-notebook/">year-specific one</a>
mostly just used for the draft schedule.
I added some shortcuts to jump to headings in the
main notebook or in the annual notebook (<code>emacsconf-main-org-notebook-heading</code> and <code>emacsconf-current-org-notebook-heading</code> <a href="https://git.emacsconf.org/emacsconf-el/tree/emacsconf.el">emacsconf.el</a>).
</p>

<p>
As usual, we used lots of structured entry properties to
store all the talk information.
Most of my functions from last year worked out
fine, aside from the occasional odd bug when I
forgot what property I was supposed to use. (<code>:ROOM:</code>, not <code>:BBB:</code>&hellip;)
</p>

<p>
The validation functions I thought about last year
would have been nice to have, since I ran into a
minor case-sensitivity issue with the Q&amp;A value
for one of the talks (live versus Live).
This happened last year too and it should have
been caught by the <code>case-fold-search</code> I thought I
added to my configuration, but since that didn't
seem to kick in, I should probably also deal with
it on the input side.
<mark>Idea:</mark> I want to validate that certain fields
like <code>QA_TYPE</code> have only a specified set of
values.
I also probably need a validation function to make
sure that newly-added talks have all the files
that the streaming setup expects, like an overlay
for OBS, and one that checks if I've set any
properties outside the expected list.

Once the speakers confirmed the tentative schedules worked for them, I published the schedule on <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2025/talks">emacsconf.org</a> on Oct 24, as sceduled. But I forgot to announce the schedule on emacsconf-discuss and other places, though. I probably felt a little uncertain about announcing the schedule because it was in such flux. There was even a point where we almost cancelled the whole thing. I also got too busy to reach out to podcasts. I remembered to post it to <a href="https://foss.events/2025/12-06-emacsconf.html">foss.events</a>, though! <mark>Idea:</mark> I can announce things and trust that it'll all settle down. I can spend some time neatening up our general <a href="https://emacsconf.org/organizers-notebook/">organizers-notebook</a> so that there's more of a step-by-step-process. Maybe <code>org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift</code> will be handy.

<p>
For communicating with speakers and volunteers, I reused the <a href="https://git.emacsconf.org/emacsconf-el/tree/emacsconf-mail.el">mail merge</a> from previous years, with a few more tweaks. I added a template for thanking volunteers.
I added some more code for mailing all the volunteers with a specific tag.
Some speakers were very used to the process and did everything pretty independently.
Other speakers needed a bit more facilitation.
</p>

<p>
I could get better at coordinating with people who want to help. In the early days, there wasn't that much to help with. A few people volunteered to help with captions for specific videos, so I waited for their edits and focused on other tasks first. I didn't want to pressure them with deadlines or preempt them by working on those when I'd gotten through my other tasks, but it was hard to leave those tasks dangling. They ended up sending in the edits shortly before the conference, which still gave me enough time to coordinate with speakers to review the captions. It was hard to wait, but I appreciate the work they contributed. In late November and early December, there were so many tasks to juggle, but I probably could have e-mailed people once a week with a summary of the things that could be done. <mark>Idea:</mark> I can practice letting people know what I'm working on and what tasks remain, and I can find a way to ask for help that fits us. If I clean up the design of the backstage area, that might make it easier for people to get started. If I improve my code for comparing captions, I can continue editing subtitles as a backup if I want to take a break from my other work, and merge in other people's contributions when they send them.
</p>

<p>
I set up <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> for backstage coordination with other organizers, but we didn't use it much because most of the time, we were on air with someone, so we didn't want to interrupt each other.
</p>

<p>
There was a question about our guidelines for conduct and someone's out-of-conference postings. I forwarded the matter to our private mailing list so that other volunteers could think about it, because at that point in time, my brain was fried. That seemed to have been resolved. Too bad there's no <code>edebug-on-entry</code> for people so we can figure things out with more clarity. I'm glad other people are around to help navigate situations!

<h3 id="emacsconf-2025-notes-schedule">Schedule</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-emacsconf-2025-notes-schedule">
<p>
Like last year, we had two days of talks, with two tracks on the first day, and about 15-20 minutes between each talk.
We had a couple of last-minute switches to live Q&amp;A sessions, which was totally fine.
That's why I set up all the rooms in advance.
</p>

<p>
A few talks ended up being a bit longer than their
proposed length.
With enough of a heads-up, I could adjust the
schedule (especially as other talks got
cancelled), but sometimes it was difficult to keep
track of changes as I shuffled talks around.
I wrote some code to calculate the differences, and
I appreciate how the speakers patiently dealt with
my flurries of e-mails.
</p>

<p>
Scheduling some more buffer
time between talks might be good. In general, the
Q&amp;A time felt like a good length, though, and it
was nice that people had the option of continuing
with the speaker in the web conference room. So it
was actually more like we had two or three or four
tracks going on at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Having two tracks allowed us to accept all the
talks. I'm glad I kept the dev track to a single
day, though. I ended up managing things all by
myself on Sunday afternoon, and that was hard
enough with one track. Fortunately, speakers were
comfortable navigating the Etherpad questions themselves and reading the questions out loud. Sometimes I stepped in during natural pauses to read the next question on the list
(assuming I managed to find the right window among all
the ones open on my screen).
</p>

<p>
<mark>Idea:</mark> If I get better at setting up one window per ongoing Q&amp;A session and using the volume controls to spatialize each so that I can distinguish left/middle/right conversations, it might be easier for me to keep track of all of those. I wasn't quite sure how to arrange all the windows I wanted to pay attention even with an external screen (1920x1200 + my laptop's 1920x1080). I wonder if I'd trust <a href="https://github.com/emacs-exwm/exwm">EXWM</a> to handle tiling all the different web browser windows, while keeping the VNC windows floating so that they don't mess with the size of the stream. Maybe I can borrow my husband's ultrawide monitor. Maybe I can see if I can use one of those fancy macropads for quick shortcuts, like switching to a specified set of windows and unmuting myself. Maybe I can figure out how to funnel streaming captions into IRC channels or another text form (also a requested feature) so that I can monitor them that way and quickly skim the history&hellip; Or I can focus on making it easier for people to volunteer (and reminding myself that it's okay to ask for their help!), since then I don't have to split my attention all those different ways and I get to learn from other people's awesomeness.
</p>

<p>
If we decide to go with one track next year, we
might have to prioritize talks, which is hard
especially if some of the accepted speakers end up
cancelling anyway. Alternatively, a better way
might be to make things easier for last-minute
volunteers to join and read the questions. They
don't even need any special setup or anything;
they can just join the BigBlueButton web conference session and read from
the pad. <mark>Idea:</mark> A single Etherpad with all the
direct BBB URLs and pad links will make this
easier for last-minute volunteers.
</p>

<p>
Also like last year, we added an open mic session to fill in the time from a last-minute cancellation, and that went well. It might be nice to build that into the schedule earlier instead of waiting for a cancellation so that people can plan for it. We moved the closing remarks earlier as well so that people didn't have to stay up so late in other timezones.
</p>

<p>
I am super, super thankful we had a <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2023/10/emacsconf-backstage-autopilot-with-crontab/">crontab</a> automatically switching between talks, because that meant one less time-sensitive thing I had to pay attention to. I didn't worry about cutting people off too early because people could continue off-stream, although this generally worked better for Q&amp;A sessions done over BigBlueButton or on Etherpad rather than IRC. I also improved the code for generating a test schedule so that I could test the automatic switching.
</p>

<p>
It was probably a good thing that I didn't automatically write the next session time to the Etherpad, though, because people had already started adding notes and questions to the pad before the conference, so I couldn't automatically update them as I changed the schedule. <mark>Idea:</mark> I can write a function to copy the heads-up for the next talk, or I can add the text to a checklist so that I can easily copy and paste it. Since I was managing the check-ins for both streams as well as doing the occasional bit of hosting, a checklist combining all the info for all the streams might be nice. I didn't really take advantage of the editability of Etherpad, so maybe putting it into HTML instead will allow me to make it easier to skim or use. (Copy icons, etc.)
</p>

<p>
Like before, I offset the start of the dev track to give ourselves a little more time to warm up, and I started Sunday morning with more asynchronous Q&amp;A instead of web conferences. Not much in terms of bandwidth issues this year.
</p>

<p>
We got everyone's time constraints correctly this year, hooray!
Doing timezone conversions in Emacs means I don't have to calculate things myself, and the code for checking the time constraints of scheduled sessions worked with this year's shifting schedules too.
<mark>Idea:</mark> It would be great to mail iCalendar files (.ics) to each speaker so that they can easily add their talk (including check-in time, URLs, and mod codes) to their calendar.
Bonus points if we can get it to update previous copies if I've made a change.
</p>

<p>
This is what the schedule looked like:
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><code>(<span class="org-keyword">with-temp-file</span> (expand-file-name <span class="org-string">"schedule.svg"</span> emacsconf-cache-dir)
  (<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((emacsconf-use-absolute-url t))
    (svg-print
     (emacsconf-schedule-svg
      800 300
      (emacsconf-publish-prepare-for-display
       (emacsconf-get-talk-info))))))
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>
I added a <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2025/organizers-notebook/#draft-schedule">vertical view</a> to the 2025 organizers notebook, which was easier to read. I also added some code to handle cancelling a talk and keeping track of rescheduled talks.

<mark>Idea:</mark> I still haven't gotten around to localizing times on the watch pages. That could be nice.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-emacsconf-2025-notes-recorded-introductions">
<p>
Recording all the introductions beforehand was extremely helpful. I used <a href="https://github.com/sachac/subed-record/blob/main/subed-record.el">subed-record.el</a> to record and compile the audio without having to edit out the oopses manually. Recording the intros also gave me something to do other than worry about missing videos.
</p>

<p>
A few speakers helped correct the pronunciations of their names, which was nice. I probably could have picked up the right pronunciation for one of them if I had remembered to check his video first, as he had not only uploaded a video early but even said his name in it. Next time, I can go check that first.
</p>

<p>
This year, all the intros played the properly corrected files along with their subtitles. The process is improving!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-emacsconf-2025-notes-recorded-videos" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="emacsconf-2025-notes-recorded-videos">Recorded videos</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-emacsconf-2025-notes-recorded-videos">
<p>
As usual, most speakers sent in pre-recorded
videos this year, although it took them a little
bit longer to do them because life got busy for
everyone. Just like last year, speakers uploaded
their files via <a href="https://github.com/psi-4ward/psitransfer">PsiTransfer</a>. I picked up some
people's videos late because I hadn't checked.
I've modified the upload instructions to ask the
speakers to email me when they've uploaded their
file, since I'm not sure that PsiTransfer can
automatically send email when a new file has been
uploaded. We set up a proper domain name, so this
year, people didn't get confused by trying to FTP
to it.
</p>

<p>
I had to redo some of the re-encodings and ask one speaker to reupload is video, but we managed to catch those errors before they streamed.
</p>

<p>
I normalized all the audio myself this year. I used Audacity to normalize it to -16 LUFS. I didn't listen to everything in full, but the results seemed to have been alright. <mark>Idea:</mark> Audio left/right difference was not an issue this year, but in the future, I might still consider mixing the audio down to mono.
</p>

<p>
All the files properly loaded from the cache directory instead of getting shadowed by files in other directories, since I reused the process from last year instead of switching mid-way.
</p>

<p>
People didn't complain about colour smearing, but
it looks like the Calc talk had some. Ah! For some
reason, MPV was back on 0.35, so now I've modified
our Ansible playbook so that it insists on 0.38. I
don't think there were any issues about switching
between dark mode or light mode.
</p>

<p>
There was one last-minute upload where I wasn't sure whether there were supposed to be captions in the first part. When I toggled the captions to try to reload them once I copied over the updated VTT, I think I accidentally left them toggled them off, but fortunately the speaker let me know in IRC.
</p>

<p>
For the opening video, I made the text a bit more generic by removing the year references so that I can theoretically reuse the audio next year.
That might save me some time.
</p>

<p>
I modified our <a href="https://emacsconf.org/mpv/">mpv.conf</a> to display the time remaining in the lower right-hand corner. This was a fantastic idea that made it easy to give the speaker a heads-up that their recorded talk was about to finish and that we were about to switch over to the live Q&amp;A session. Because sometimes we weren't able to spare enough attention to host a session, I usually just added the time of the next session to the Etherpad to give speakers a heads-up that the stream would be switching away from their Q&amp;A session. Then I didn't need to make a fancy Javascript timer either.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-emacsconf-2025-notes-captioning" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="emacsconf-2025-notes-captioning">Captioning</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-emacsconf-2025-notes-captioning">
<p>
The next step in the process was to caption each uploaded video. While speech recognition tools give us a great headstart, there's really no way around the work of getting technical topics right.
</p>

<p>
We used <a href="https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX">WhisperX</a> for speech-to-text again. This time, I used the <code>&#45;&#45;initial_prompt</code> argument
to try to get it to spell things properly: "Transcribe this talk about Emacs. It may mention Emacs keywords such as Org Mode, Org Roam, Magit, gptel, or chatgpt-shell, or tech keywords such as LLMs. Format function names and keyboard shortcut sequences according to Emacs conventions using Markdown syntax. For example: control h becomes \`C-h\`.". It did not actually do the keyboard shortcut sequences. (Emacs documentation is an infinitesimal fraction of the training data, probably!) It generally did a good job of recognizing Emacs rather than EMAX and capitalizing things. <mark>Idea:</mark> I can experiment with few-shot prompting techniques or just expand <code>my-subed-fix-common-errors</code> to detect the patterns.
</p>

<p>
This year, we used Anush V's <a href="https://gitlab.com/jun8git/sub-seg">sub-seg</a> tool to split the subtitles into reasonably short, logically split phrases. I used to manually split these so that the subtitles flowed more smoothly, or if I was pressed for time, I left it at just the length-based splits that WhisperX uses. sub-seg was much nicer as a starting point, so I wrote a shell script to run it more automatically. It still had a few run-on captions and there were a couple of files that confused it, so I manually split those.

<p>
I felt that it was also a good idea to correct the timing before posting the subtitles for other people to work on because otherwise it would be more difficult for any volunteers to be able to replay parts of the subtitles that needed extra attention. WhisperX often gave me overlapping caption timestamps and it didn't always have word timestamps I could use instead. I used <a href="https://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/">Aeneas</a> to re-align the text with the audio so that we could get better timestamps. As usual, Aeneas got confused by silences or non-speech audio, so I used my <a href="https://github.com/sachac/subed/blob/main/subed/subed-word-data.el">subed-word-data.el</a> code to visualize the word timing and my <a href="https://github.com/sachac/subed/blob/main/subed/subed-align.el">subed-align.el</a> code to realign regions. <mark>Idea:</mark> I should probably be able to use the word data to realign things semi-automatically, or at least flag things that might need more tweaking. There were a few chunks that weren't recognized at all, but I was able to spot them and fix them when I was fixing the timestamps. Making this more automated will make it much easier to share captioning work with other volunteers. Alternatively, I can also post the talks for captioning before I fix the timestamps, because I can fix them while other people are editing the text.
</p>

<p>
While I was correcting the timestamps, it was pretty tempting for me to just go ahead and fix whatever errors I encountered along the way. From there on, it seemed like only a little bit more work was needed in order to get it ready for the speaker to review, and besides, doing subtitles is one of the things I enjoy about EmacsConf. So the end result is that for most of the talks, by the time I finished getting it to the point where I felt like someone who was new to captioning could take over, it was often quite close to being done. I did actually manage to successfully accept some people's help. The code that I wrote for showing me the word differences between two files (sometimes the speaker's script or the subtitles that were edited by another volunteer) was very useful for last-minute merges.
</p>

<p>
Working on captions is one of my favourite parts. Well-edited captions are totally a nice-to-have, but I like it when people can watch the videos (or skim them) and not worry about not being able to hear or understand what someone said. I enjoy sitting down and spending time with people's presentations, turning them into text that we can search. Captioning helps me feel connected with some of the things I love the most about the Emacs community.
</p>

<p>
I really appreciated how a number of speakers and volunteers helped with quality control by watching other videos in the backstage area. <mark>Idea:</mark> I can spend some time improving the design of the backstage area to make it more pleasant and to make it easier for people to find something to work on if they have a little time.
</p>

<p>
Of course, some talks couldn't be captioned beforehand because they were live. For live conferences and for many of the Q&amp;A sessions, we used BigBlueButton.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-emacsconf-2025-notes-bigbluebutton-web-conference">
<p>
We used <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org">BigBlueButton</a> again this year instead of switching over to something like Galene. I moved the node from bandali's Linode account to mine so that I wouldn't feel as guilty bringing it up and down throughout the year for various Emacs meetups. That also meant that the actual setup was fairly stable since it had survived a lot of meetups before EmacsConf, and I didn't have to spend as much time before the event worrying about it. I still worried a little, as after the November OrgMeetup, I noticed a technical issue that I couldn't nail down. Fortunately, that happened after the meetup had already ended. I also used my meetup crontab to schedule test sessions with some speakers so that they could record their presentation or doublecheck their sharing setup.
</p>

<p>
I resized the BigBlueButton early Friday afternoon this year so that speakers could have a few more hours to test their setups if they wanted to, especially since one speaker had mentioned having a hard time sharing his screen on Wayland.
</p>

<p>
I thought I had <code>&#45;&#45;allow_auto_disk_resize true</code> in the <code>bbb-prod</code> shell-script I used to resize the node, but I don't think <code>linode-cli</code> actually resized the disk (maybe I ran a different shell script), and I forgot to double-check that before the conference. Fortunately, we had just enough space for all the recordings. I noticed only when I was waiting for the recordings to finish processing, since some of them were failing. <mark>Idea:</mark> Next time, I should manually check that the disk has resized, and I can probably tweak my checklist too.
</p>

<p>
Like before, we used moderator codes so that speakers could let themselves into the room and get everything set up just in case. <mark>Idea:</mark> I wonder if there's a way to specify the moderator code in the URL so that I can link to that directly. Maybe I can modify the web interface to fill that in with a little bit of Javascript.
</p>

<p>
Oddly, the moderator codes didn't let people start or stop recording, but fortunately I was able to log in and take care of all of that. I mostly remembered to start the recording, except for one instance where I started recording a little bit late.

I might be able to get away with a Linode 8 GB node (USD 0.072/hour) instead of a Linode 16 GB node (USD 0.144/hour), but keeping it at the current size is probably okay.
</p>

<p>
I'll go into more detail in the budget section, but the total was USD 14.02 to host BigBlueButton ourselves in December, and between USD 5 to USD 8 / month to run it the rest of the time (including upsizing it for meetups), so that was much less than what it would have cost for BigBlueButton-specific hosting.

<p>
To keep the live talks and Q&amp;A sessions flowing smoothly, there's a bit of a scramble behind the scenes. We asked speakers to check in at least half an hour before they need to go live, and most of them were able to find their way to the BigBlueButton room using the provided moderator codes. I mostly handled the check-ins, with some help from Corwin when two people needed to be checked in at the same time. We generally didn't have any tech issues, although a couple of people were missing during their Q&amp;A sessions. (We just shrugged and continued; too much to take care of to worry about anything!)
</p>

<p>
Check-ins are usually good opportunities to chat with speakers, but because I needed to pay attention to the other streams as well as check in other people, it felt a bit more rushed and less enjoyable. I missed having those opportunities to connect, but I'm glad speakers were able to handle so much on their own.

Corwin did a lot of the on-stream hosting with a little help from Amin on Saturday. I occasionally jumped in and asked the speakers questions from the pad, but when I was busy checking people in or managing other technical issues cropping up, the speakers also read the questions out themselves so that I could match things up in the transcript afterwards.

No crashes this time, I think. Hooray!

<p>
I used September and October to review all the infrastructure and see what made sense to upgrade. The BigBlueButton instance is on a virtual private server that's dedicated to it, since it doesn't like to share with any other services. Since I set it up from scratch following the recommended configuration, the server uses a recent version of Ubuntu. Some of the other servers use outdated Debian distributions that no longer get security updates. They have other services on them, so I'll leave them to bandali to upgrade when he's ready.

<p>
I am so, so glad that we had our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNC">VNC</a>+<a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> setup this year, with two separate user accounts using OBS to stream each track from a virtual desktop on a remote server. We switched to this setup in 2022 so that I could handle multiple tracks without worrying about last-minute coordination or people's laptop specs. If we had had our original setup in 2019, with hosts streaming from their personal computers, I think we'd have been dead in the water. Instead, our scripts took care of most of the on-screen actions, so I just needed to rearrange the layout. (<mark>Idea:</mark> If I can figure out how to get BigBlueButton to use our preferred layout, that would make it even better.)
</p>

<p>
I used MPV to monitor the streams in little thumbnails. I set those windows to always be on top, and I set the audio so that the general track was on my left side and the development track was o my right. I used some shortcuts to jump between streams reliably, taking advantage of how I bound the Windows key on my laptop to the Super modifier. I used KDE's custom keyboard shortcuts to set Super-g to raise all of my general-track windows and Super-d to do the same for all of the development-track ones. Those were set to commands like this:

</p>

<p>
To get the video streams out to viewers, we used <a href="http://icecast.org/">Icecast (a streaming media server)</a> on a Linode 64GB 16 core shared CPU server again this year, and that seemed to work out. I briefly contemplated using a more modern setup like <a href="https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/dynamic-modules/rtmp/">nginx-rtmp</a>, <a href="https://antmedia.io/">Ant Media Server</a>, or <a href="https://ossrs.net/lts/en-us/">SRS</a> if we wanted HLS (wider support), adaptive bitrate streaming, or lower latency, but I decided against it because I didn't want to add more complexity. Good thing too. This year would not have been a good time to experiment with something new.
</p>

<p>
Like before, watching the stream directly using mpv, vlc, or ffplay was smoother than watching it through the web-based viewers. One of the participants suggested adding more detailed instructions for VLC so that people can enjoy it even without using the command-line, so we did.
</p>

<p>
The 480p stream and the YouTube stream were all right, although I forgot to start one of the YouTube streams until a bit later. <mark>Idea:</mark> Next time, I can set all the streams to autostart.
</p>

<p>
Corwin had an extra server lying around, so I used that to restream to Toobnix just in case. That seems to have worked, although I didn't have the brainspace to check on it.
</p>

<p>
I totally forgot about displaying random packages on the waiting screen. <mark>Idea:</mark> Maybe next year I can add a fortune.txt to the cache directory with various one-line Emacs tips.
</p>

<p>
I might be able to drop the specifications down to 32GB 8 core if we wanted to.

People appreciated being able to get videos and transcripts as soon as each talk aired. Publishing the video files and transcripts generally worked out smoothly, aside from a few times when I needed to manually update the git repository. I modified the code to add more links to the <a href="https://media.emacsconf.org/2025/schedules/">Org files</a> and to walk me through publishing videos to YouTube.
</p>

<p>
I uploaded all the videos to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EmacsConf">YouTube</a> and scheduled them so that I didn't have to manage that during the conference. I did not get around to uploading them to <a href="https://toobnix.org/c/emacsconf/videos">Toobnix</a> until after the conference since dealing with lots of duplicated updates is annoying. I've been writing a few more functions to work with the Toobnix API, so it might be a little easier to do things like update descriptions or subtitles next year.

<p>
As usual, we used <a href="https://etherpad.org/">Etherpad</a> to collect questions from conference partcipants, and many speakers answered questions there as well.
</p>

<p>
I used the <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/systemli/etherpad/">systemli.etherpad</a> Ansible role to upgrade to Etherpad 2.5. This included some security fixes, so that was a relief.
</p>

<p>
I added pronouns and pronunciations to the Etherpad to make it easier for hosts to remember just in case.
</p>

<p>
I did not get to use <code>emacsconf-erc-copy</code> to copy IRC to Etherpad because I was too busy juggling everything else, so I just updated things afterwards.
</p>

<p>
<mark>Idea:</mark> Just in case, it might be good to have a backup plan in case I need to switch Etherpad to authenticated users or read-only use. Maybe I can prepare questions beforehand, just in case we get some serious griefing.

<p>
The plain-text chat channels on IRC continued to be a great place to discuss things, with lots of discussions, comments, and encouraging feedback. My automated IRC system continued to do a good job of posting the talk links, and the announcements made it easier to split up the log by talk.
</p>

<p>
Planning for social challenges is harder than planning for technical ones, though.
libera.chat has been dealing with spam attacks recently. Someone's also been griefing #emacs and other channels via the chat.emacsconf.org web interface, so we decided to keep chat.emacsconf.org dormant until the conference itself. If this is an issue next year, we might need to figure out moderation. I'd prefer to not require everyone to register accounts or be granted voice permissions, so we'll see.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-emacsconf-2025-notes-extracting-the-q-a">
<p>
We recorded all the Q&amp;A sessions so that we could post them afterwards. As mentioned, I only started the recording late once. Progress! I generally started it a few minutes early. As I got more confident about paying attention to the start of a session and rearranging the layout on screen, I also got better at starting the recording shortly before turning it over to the speaker. That made it easier to trim the recordings afterwards.
</p>

<p>
It took me a little longer to get to the Q&amp;A sessions this year. Like last year, getting the recordings from BigBlueButton was fairly easy because I could get a single processed video instead of combining the audio, screenshare, and webcam video myself. This year the single-file video downloads were .m4v files, so I needed to modify things slightly. I think my workflow last year assumed I started with .webm files. Anyway, after some re-encoding, I got it processed. Now I've modified the <code>/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/scripts/video.yml</code> to enable webm. I wonder if it got wiped after my panic-reinstall after November's OrgMeetup. <mark>Idea:</mark> I should add the config to my Ansible so that it stays throughout reinstalls and upgrades.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a <code>emacsconf-subed-copy-current-chapter-text</code> function so that I can more easily paste answers into the Q&amp;A&hellip; which turned out to be a superset of the <code>emacsconf-extract-subed-copy-section-text</code> I mentioned in last year's notes and totally forgot about. This tells me that I need to add it to my <a href="https://emacsconf.org/organizers-notebook/">EmacsConf - organizers-notebook</a> notes so that I actually know what to do. I did not use my completion functions to add section headings based on comments either. Apparently this was <code>emacsconf-extract-insert-note-with-question-heading</code>, which I do have a note about in my organizer notebook.
</p>

<p>
Audio mixing was reasonable. I normalized the audio in Audacity, and I manually fixed some sections where some participants' audio volumes were lower.

<p>
These hosting costs are a little higher than 2024 because we now pay for hosting the BigBlueButton server (meet) year-round. That's ~ 5 USD/month for a Linode 1 GB instance and an extra USD 2-3 / month that lets us provide a platform for OrgMeetup, Emacs APAC, and Emacs Berlin by alternating between a 1 GB Linode and an 8 GB Linode as needed. The meetups had previously been using the free <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">Jitsi</a> service, but sometimes that has some limitations. In 2023 and most of 2024, the BigBlueButton server had been provided by FossHost, which has since shut down. This time, maintaining the server year-round meant that we didn't have to do any last-minute scrambles to install and configure the machine, which I appreciated. I could potentially get the cost down further if I use Linode's custom images to create a node from a saved image right before a meetup, but I think that trades about USD 2 of savings/month for much more technical risk, so I'm fine with just leaving it running downscaled.
</p>

<p>
If we need to cut costs, live0 might be more of a candidate because I think we'll be able to use Ansible scripts to recreate the Icecast setup. I think we're fine, though. Also, based on the CPU peak loads, we might be able to get away with lower specs during the conference (maybe meet: 8 GB, front: 8 GB, live: 32 GB), for an estimated savings of USD 27.76, with the risk of having to worry about it if we hit the limit. So it's probably not a big deal for now.
</p>

<p>
I think people's donations through the Working Together program can cover the costs for this year, just like last year. (Thanks!) I just have to do some paperwork.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these servers, Ry P provided res.emacsconf.org for OBS streaming over VNC sessions.
The Free Software Foundation also provided <a href="https://media.emacsconf.org">media.emacsconf.org</a> for serving media files, and yang3 provided <a href="https://eu.media.emacsconf.org">eu.media.emacsconf.org</a>.

If other people are considering running an online conference, the hosting part is surprisingly manageable, at least for our tiny audience size of about 100 peak simultaneous viewers and 35 web conference participants. It was nice to make sure that everyone can watch without ads or Javascript.
</p>

<p>
Behind the scenes: In terms of keeping an eye on performance limits, we're usually more CPU-bound than memory- or disk-bound, so we had plenty of room this year. Now I have some Org Babel source blocks to automatically collect the stats from different servers. Here's what that Org block looks like:
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org"><code><span class="org-org-block-begin-line">#+begin_src sh :dir /ssh:res:/ :results verbatim :wrap example</span>
<span class="org-org-block">top -b -n 1 | head</span>
<span class="org-org-block-end-line">#+end_src</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>
I should write something similar to grab the Icecast stats from  <a href="http://live0.emacsconf.org:8001/status.xsl">http://live0.emacsconf.org:8001/status.xsl</a> periodically. Curl will do the trick, of course, but maybe I can get Emacs to add a row to an Org Mode table.

As part of my general interest in time-tracking, I tracked EmacsConf-related time separately from my general Emacs-related time.

<p>
This year, I spent more time doing the reencoding and captions in December, since most of the submissions came in around that time. I didn't even listen to all the videos in real time. I used my shortcuts to skim the captions and jump around. It would have been nice to be able to spread out the work a little bit more instead of squeezing most of it into the first week of December, since that would have made it easier to coordinate with other volunteers without feeling like I might have to do more last-minute scrambles if they were busier than expected.
</p>

<p>
I was a little bit nervous about making sure that the infrastructure was all going to be okay for the conference as well as double checking the videos for possible encoding issues or audio issues.
Stress tends to make me gloss over things or make small mistakes, which meant I had to slow down even more to double-check things and add more things to our process documentation.
</p>

<p>
I'm glad it all worked out. Even if I switched that time to working on Emacs stuff myself, I don't think I would have been able to put together all the kinds of wonderful tips and experiences that other people shared in the conference, so that was worthwhile.

<p>
I've already started hearing from people who
enjoyed the conference and picked up lots of good
tips from it. Wonderful!
</p>

<p>
EmacsConf 2025 was a bit more challenging this
year. The world has gotten a lot busier.
Return-to-work mandates, job market turmoil,
health challenges, bigger societal changes&hellip; It's
harder for people to find time. For example, the
maintainers of Emacs and Org are too busy working
on useful updates and bugfixes to rehash the news
for us, so maybe I'll get back to doing Emacs News
Highlights next year. I'm super lucky in that I
can stand outside most of all of that and make
this space where we can take a break and chat
about Emacs. I really appreciated having this
nice, cozy little place where people could get
together and bump into other people who might be
interested in similar things, either at the event
itself or in the discussions afterwards. I'm glad
we started with a large schedule and let things
settle down. I'd rather have that slack instead of
making speakers feel stressed or guilty.
</p>

<p>
I love the way that working on the various parts
of the conference gives me an excuse to tinker with Emacs and figure out how to use it for more things.
</p>

<p>
As you can tell from the other sections in this
post, I tend to have so much fun doing this that I
often forget to check if I've already written the
same functions before.
When I do remember, I feel really good about being
able to build on this accumulation of little
improvements.
</p>

<p>
I didn't feel like I really got to attend EmacsConf this year, but that's not really surprising because I don't usually get to. I think the only time I've actually been able to take proper notes during EmacsConf itself was back in <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2013/04/emacs-conference-2013-sketchnotes-also-pdf/">2013</a>. It's okay, I get to spend a little time with presentations before anyone else does, and there's always the time afterwards. Plus I can always reach out to the speakers myself. It might be nice to be able to just sit and enjoy it and ask questions. Maybe someday when I've automated enough to make this something that I can run easily even on my own.
</p>

<p>
So let's quickly sketch out some possible scenarios:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>I might need to do it on my own next year,</b> in case other organizers get pulled away at the last minute: I think it's possible, especially if I can plan for some emergency moderation or last-minute volunteers. I had a good experience, despite the stress of juggling things live on stream. (One time, one of the speakers had a question for me, and he had to repeat it a few times before I found the right tab and unmuted.) Still, I think it would be great to do it again next year.</li>
<li><b>Some of the other organizers might be more available:</b> It would be nice
to have people on screen handling the hosting. If people can help out with verifying the encoding, normalizing the audio, and shepherding videos through the process, that might let me free up some time to coordinate captions with other volunteers even for later submissions.</li>
<li><b>I might get better at asking for help and making it easier for people to get involved:</b> That would be pretty awesome. Sometimes it's hard for me to think about what and how, so if some people can take the initiative, that could be good.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is good. It means that I can probably say yes to EmacsConf even if it's just me and whoever wants to share what they've been learning about Emacs this year. That's the basic level. We're still here, amazing! Anything else people can add to that is a welcome bonus. We'll make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup">stone soup</a> together.
</p>

<p>
EmacsConf doesn't have to be snazzy. We don't need to try to out-market VS Code or whatever other editors emerge over the next 10 years. We can just keep having fun and doing awesome things with Emacs. I love the way that this online conference lets people participate from all over the world. We like to focus on facilitating sharing and then capturing the videos, questions, answers so that people can keep learning from them afterwards. I'm looking forward to more of that next year.
</p>

<p>
I'd love to hear what people thought of it and see how we can make things better together. I'd love to swap notes with organizers of other conferences, too. What's it like behind the scenes?
</p>

<p>
My next steps are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Extract part of this into a report for the emacsconf.org website, like <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2024/report/">EmacsConf - 2024 - EmacsConf 2024 Report</a>.</li>
<li>Announce the resources and report on emacsconf-discuss.</li>
<li>Catch up on the other parts of my life I've been postponing.</li>
<li>Start thinking about EmacsConf 2026 =)</li>
