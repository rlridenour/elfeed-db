 
          <p>Here&rsquo;s a crazy thought: to me, parenting feels very similar to programming in JavaScript. The more I think about it, the more convinced I am.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an old fart that&rsquo;s been coding stuff in JavaScript since its inception, you&rsquo;ll undoubtedly be familiar with <a href="https://www.crockford.com/books.html">Douglas Crockford&rsquo;s bibles</a>, or to be more precise, that one tiny booklet from 2008 <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>. That book covered by a cute O&rsquo;Reilly butterfly is only 172 pages long. Contrast that with any tome attempting to do a &ldquo;definitive guide&rdquo;, like David Flanagan&rsquo;s, which is 1093 pages thick. Ergo, one starts thinking: only <code>16%</code> of Javascript is inherently <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>And that was 18 years ago. Since then, the EcmaScript standard threw new stuff on top in a steady yearly fashion, giving us weird and wonderful things (Promise chaining! Constants that aren&rsquo;t constants! Private members with <code>#</code> that look weirder than <code>_</code>! Nullish coalescing?? Bigger integers!) that arguably can be called syntactic sugar to try and disguise the bitter taste that is released slowly but surely if you chew on JS code long enough.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not confusing enough, the JS ecosystem has evolved enormously as well: we now have 20+ languages built on top of JS that compile/transpile to it. We have TypeScript that has its own <code>private</code> keyword that has nothing to do with <code>#</code>, go nuts! We have ClojureScript that lets you write your React Native components in Clojure that compiles to JS that compiles to Java with Expo that compiles your app! We have <code>bun</code> and <code>deno</code> and <code>esbuild</code> and god-knows-what-else that replaces <code>npx</code> and possibly also <code>webpack</code>? At this point, I&rsquo;m starting to transpile JS into transpiration.</p>
<p>Parenting often feels like <em>Javascript: The Good Parts</em> versus <em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em>. With our two very young children, there are many, many (oh so many) moments where we feel like we&rsquo;re stumbling around in the dark, getting lost in that thick tome that dictates the things that we should be doing. When the eldest has yet another I&rsquo;ll-just-throw-myself-on-the-floor-here moment and the youngest keeps on puking and yelling because he just discovered rolling on his tummy, I forget <em>The Good Parts</em>.</p>
<p>To be perfectly frank, in those moments, I often wonder if Crockford had been lying to us. Are there even any good parts at all? We all know JS was cobbled together overnight because Netscape needed &ldquo;some&rdquo; language to make static languages a bit more dynamic. A language for the masses! What a monster it has become&mdash;in both positive and negative sense.</p>
<p>It often feels like Wouter doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore. Instead, there&rsquo;s only daddy. It has been months since I last touched a book, notebook, or fountain pen. It has been months since my wife &amp; I did something together to strengthen our relationship which currently is being reduced to snapping at each other because we&rsquo;re still not perfectly synced when it comes to educational rules. Perhaps just writing and publishing this is reassurance for myself: proof of existence. Hi! This is not a bot!</p>
<p>JavaScript is a big mess. Parenting feels like that as well. The ecosystem around JS rapidly changes and only the keenest frontend developer is able to keep up. I have no idea how to keep up with parenting. During our day-to-day struggles, you barely notice that the kids are growing and changing, but when you look back, you&rsquo;re suddenly surprised yet another milestone has passed. Is that part of the <em>Good Parts</em> or the <em>Bad Parts</em>?</p>
<p>Maybe Flanagan&rsquo;s <em>Definitive Guide</em> should be used to smack people on the head that do not obey to the latest EcmaScript standard best practices. I often have the feeling of getting smacked on the head when trying to deal with yet another kid emergency situation. I&rsquo;m exhausted. Last week I yelled so hard at our eldest that she and I both started crying&mdash;she on the outside, me on the inside. I have no idea who I am anymore. I&rsquo;m not like that. But it seems that I am. Our children successfully managed to bring out the worst in ourselves, even parts that I didn&rsquo;t even know where there. I&rsquo;ll let you be the judge of whether that bit belongs in the <em>Good Parts</em>.</p>
<p>Yet I love JS. I love its dynamic duck type system (fuck TypeScript), I love its functional <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, <code>reduce()</code> roots, I love prototypal inheritance. But I often forget about it because it&rsquo;s buried in all that contemporary mud. Of course I love my children, but right now, I can&rsquo;t say that I love parenting, because it&rsquo;s buried in all that attention demanding and shouting that reduces our energy meters to zero in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>My wife made a thoughtful remark the other day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re no longer living. At this point, we&rsquo;re merely surviving. Every single day.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I write this, it&rsquo;s almost 17:30 PM. The kids spent the day at my parents so I don&rsquo;t even have the right to complain. Every minute now, they can come back and the bomb will explode again. There&rsquo;s a little voice in my head that says &ldquo;just get to the cooking, get them to eat and shove them in bed. Only an hour and a half left.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s sad or not. I need to get cooking. Only an hour and a half left. Don&rsquo;t blame me, I no longer live. We&rsquo;re merely surviving.</p>
<p>If someone manages to write <em>Parenting: The Good Parts</em> in only 172 pages, let me know.</p>
