<p>Benin’s government says its security forces have put down an attempted military coup after a group of soldiers briefly seized state television in Cotonou on Sunday and announced the dissolution of President Patrice Talon’s government and the constitution. Interior Minister Alassane Seidou and later Talon himself appeared in video addresses to say loyal troops had restored order, with the president stressing the situation was &quot;totally under control&quot; and vowing that those responsible would be punished. Authorities say around 14 members of the military have been arrested, while some mutinous soldiers remain at large after clashes that included gunfire near the presidential residence and other areas of the economic capital. The attempt, which came months before a scheduled presidential election and amid concerns about security in northern Benin, prompted rapid military assistance from regional bloc ECOWAS and neighbouring Nigeria, underscoring West Africa’s heightened sensitivity to further coups after a string of takeovers in recent years.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/OP8NZAkG-6CP-JGeDFyUZIzKnoOSRQM6NskzAKHZ1DRwaRv_8_1KYObcJZlf68Otv1orzKVVjI7ME6H9BYWhMwZzK4uNbbbrusQpCc98mSXUq9TYVFgkYuNCqXsA7CLZAi6D8A200PIho3wmE5wsaUBbvN26n051NO__rl1yNB3sYYbQroFfCPeMn_G-ZtrG2nNmSoGSu-F65rGsYDXtwA' alt='Soldiers stand guard outside Benin’s state radio and television headquarters in Cotonou after loyalist forces moved to block an attempted coup.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Coup leaders’ claims: The soldiers who appeared on state TV called themselves the Military Committee for Refoundation, claimed to have ousted Talon, suspended the constitution, dissolved state institutions, and closed Benin’s borders and airspace while citing frustrations over security conditions and treatment of fallen comrades in the north.</li><li>ECOWAS military support: The West African bloc ECOWAS ordered a rapid deployment of troops from at least four member states to Benin, framing the mission as a signal that it would intervene against any unconstitutional change of government in the region.</li><li>Nigeria’s air operation: Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who also chairs ECOWAS, authorised the Nigerian Air Force to take control of Benin’s airspace and conduct precision airstrikes on positions held by pro-coup forces in Cotonou to help dislodge them.</li><li>Arrests and ongoing search: Benin’s authorities report that about 14 soldiers linked to the plot have been detained and say security forces are pursuing remaining mutineers whom Talon described as &quot;fleeing&quot; after loyalists cleared the last pockets of resistance.</li><li>Regional coup trend: The brief takeover adds Benin to the growing list of West African states that have recently faced successful or attempted coups, joining countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Guinea, Chad and Gabon since 2020.</li></ul><blockquote>I would like to assure you that the situation is completely under control and therefore invite you to calmly go about your activities starting this very evening - Patrice Talon</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Patrice Talon: Talon condemned the putschists as a small group seeking to destabilise state institutions on the basis of what he called false claims and promised that their &quot;wrongdoing will not go unpunished&quot;.
