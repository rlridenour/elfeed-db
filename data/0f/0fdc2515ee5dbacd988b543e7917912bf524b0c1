Gurman briefly reiterated this possibility in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/apple-vision-pro-chief-mike-rockwell-named-siri-head-giannandrea-keeps-ai-role">report this week</a> about Apple executive Mike Rockwell <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/">becoming the new head of Siri development</a>:<blockquote>Rockwell's experience with hardware also could help the company more deeply embed AI into its future devices. Already, the company is exploring the idea of AirPods with outward-facing cameras that could feed data to AI.</blockquote>The cameras would technically be infrared sensors.<br/>
<br/>
In a June 2024 blog post, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple planned to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/">mass produce new AirPods with infrared cameras by 2026</a>. He said the infrared camera component would be similar to the iPhone's Face ID receiver.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the new AirPods with infrared cameras would provide an enhanced spatial audio experience with Apple's Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
"For example, when a user is watching a video with Vision Pro and wearing this new AirPods, if users turn their heads to look in a specific direction, the sound source in that direction can be emphasized to enhance the spatial audio/computing experience," wrote Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
The infrared cameras could potentially enable "in-air gesture control" as well, allowing for device interaction with hand movements.<br/>
<br/>
If the alleged 2026 mass production timeframe remains on schedule, the new AirPods with infrared cameras could launch in 2026 or 2027.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/apple-still-exploring-airpods-with-cameras/">Apple Still Planning AirPods With Tiny Cameras</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-planning-airpods-with-tiny-cameras.2453842/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
