<h2>macOS Tahoe Name Leaked Ahead of Apple's WWDC Event Next Week</h2><br/>
For over a decade, Apple's macOS releases have come with a California-themed name in addition to a version number, and according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/01/macos-tahoe-name-leaked/">macOS 26 coming next week will be known as macOS Tahoe</a> in honor of the scenic mountain lake on the California–Nevada border.<br/>

<h2>iPhone 17 Base Model Now Said to Feature A18 Chip and 8GB of RAM</h2><br/>
Apple's iPhone 17 lineup is just three months away from launch, but there are still some conflicting rumors about what to expect from the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-teal.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964610" /><br/>
While some of the iPhone 17 models are expected to see a bump to 12GB of RAM, rumors have been conflicting about whether the base model will see an increase from the current 8GB and the latest report from analyst Jeff Pu claims <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/iphone-17-rumored-a18-chip-8gb-ram/">the base iPhone 17 model will stick at that number</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, rumors have indicated the non-Pro models in the iPhone 17 lineup will finally gain 120Hz displays, but a fresh claim says they will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-17-promotion-rumors-disputed/">fixed 120Hz displays rather than variable refresh</a>, suggesting they while they will get the faster refresh rates for improved performance, they won't be able to dial down to the low refresh rates needed to support an always-on display.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, rumors are split on whether potential changes to the Face ID system will lead to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/iphone-17-metalens-rumor/">smaller Dynamic Island</a> in the iPhone 17 lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Fold Said to Use A20 Chip With New Design</h2><br/>
The iPhone 18 lineup won't be launching for over a year, but analyst Jeff Pu claims that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-18-pro-a20-chip-with-new-design/">A20 chip that will debut in the devices will take advantage of new technology</a> to not only increase efficiency with smaller transistors but integrate the RAM directly onto the chip's wafer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/a20-chip-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995953" /><br/>
The change could bring an array of benefits including faster performance, longer battery life, improved thermal performance, and a smaller chip footprint.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's Long-Rumored 'homeOS' Possibly Trademarked Ahead of WWDC</h2><br/>
While it doesn't appear Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/wwdc-2025-new-hardware-or-not/">any new hardware ready</a> for a near-term launch following an introduction at WWDC next week, it's possible we could get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/homepad-preview-at-wwdc-2025-or-not/">sneak peek at Apple's upcoming smart home hub</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/homeOS2.jpg" alt="" width="1366" height="768" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801940" /><br/>
The device isn't expected to launch until late this year or even early next year, as delays to the Apple Intelligence-powered Siri revamp that is crucial to its functionality have impacted the hardware, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/homeos-trademark-filings/">recent trademark filings around "homeOS"</a> just ahead of WWDC are fueling speculation that Apple could provide a preview of what's coming.<br/>

<h2>Filmmakers Used 20 iPhones at Once to Shoot '28 Years Later'</h2><br/>
With a budget of &#36;75 million, Danny Boyle's post-apocalyptic horror film "28 Years Later" will become the first major blockbuster movie to be shot on ‌iPhone, and Sony recently showed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/filmmakers-used-20-iphones-to-shoot-28-years-later/">some of the ways the filmmakers used iPhone 15 Pro Max to capture footage for the film</a>.<br/>
