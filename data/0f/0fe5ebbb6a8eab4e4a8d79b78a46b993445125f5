<p>A residential building collapsed in Tripoli, northern Lebanon, killing at least nine people as rescue operations began on Sunday. Officials said the collapse involved an old multi-storey residential building, and some reports said two adjoining buildings fell in the Bab al-Tabbaneh area. By Monday, state-media updates cited by outlets put the death toll at 14 after search-and-rescue operations ended, while other reporting later cited 15 deaths. The collapse has renewed attention on building safety in Tripoli, where coverage described the structure as old and neglected.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/_sW54w_-DsGzNc5TCt1gOiY2Y6yuPQ8dYk4hH7U7gLAR4gHc66vJa4M23oU06R6UcYeup_DrVMd2qqwkhZWY3ruSG28swpHnMHsQrqnz1-MeJbpQ0djjBdnIWTkyLzcuXKPPVn1RvqqH14pvayupUeDI2AwsrbXjJPD0Qe8p4elk3Vzb0jA0VO0X-mJ5VY_Zp9BhuuqNeFdRDxKq6nVY7cLOWA' alt='Security and rescue personnel work at the scene after a residential building collapse in Tripoli, Lebanon.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Rescues reported: Early updates said six people were pulled from the rubble, and later reporting said rescuers assisted nine survivors as the search continued.</li><li>Injuries, trapped: Initial accounts said at least seven people were injured and that others were still believed to be under the debris, with one report saying eight were trapped.</li><li>Neighborhood context: The collapse happened in Bab al-Tabbaneh, which one report described as Tripoli’s poorest neighborhood.</li><li>Safety precautions: Security personnel evacuated nearby buildings over fears more structures could collapse.</li><li>Second incident: A civil defence official said this was the second building-collapse incident in the area in recent weeks.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Lebanon National News Agency (state media): State media updates tracked the rising toll and the shift from active searching to the end of rescue operations, citing the civil defence chief for final casualty figures.
