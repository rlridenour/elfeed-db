<p>President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of the APEC meetings in South Korea and outlined a framework to ease their trade war, with Washington offering tariff relief and Beijing agreeing to loosen some export curbs and step up purchases of U.S. soybeans . The leaders described the understanding as a temporary truce rather than a final treaty, and both sides signalled follow-up talks and more regular summit contacts next year . Analysts and several outlets noted Beijing used leverage — including rare-earths and soybean buying power — to extract concessions, prompting debate over which side gained the upper hand . The encounter also shifted dynamics at the APEC summit: Xi took a prominent role defending free trade as President Trump departed South Korea early after the meeting .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/74czYmUCZUsGzPbeRQQ6qUeY0rN2BCuQeoqfnm2RL_90n7gdnRhXtVY7xwGHjX-PBEe7uvTGgRXN6kYsAo6GgzGmQO8PmuqyJ4d6pGUPZEKEnfTi2BnwFTDs9XtAAKl5NsNnacfGmHrl3_E07Lv5XLTQ9RfPhpjJQ3RWJqRMwssAhxk082meIMQl6Xx8Egxsr9YG7PMni1qZ9afdvWdfTQ' alt='President Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, after talks on Thursday ended.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Perceived leverage: Analysts say China used threats to withhold soybean purchases and rare-earth export controls to win tariff relief and delay tighter U.S. export curbs</li><li>Tariff details: President Trump announced he would trim U.S. tariffs on China (reporting indicated a reduction to about 47% overall after the talks) as part of the short-term arrangement</li><li>Short-term stability: Observers said the leaders’ pact is likely to produce at least months of calmer U.S.-China economic relations, with a formal trade deal expected as soon as next week and more summit meetings signalled</li></ul><blockquote>America is respected again – RESPECTED LIKE NEVER BEFORE! - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. administration / President Trump: The meeting produced an understanding that included tariff relief from Washington in exchange for Chinese commitments on rare earths and soybean purchases, which the White House described as progress during the Asia trip.
