<p>Mini-Heap posts usually appear when several new items accumulate in the <a class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" href="https://dailynous.com/heap-of-links/">Heap of Links</a>, a collection of items from around the web that may be of interest to philosophers. The Heap of Links consists partly of suggestions from readers; if you find something online that you think would be of interest to the philosophical community, please <a class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" href="mailto:dailynouseditor@gmail.com">send it in</a> for consideration for the Heap. Thank you.<br />
