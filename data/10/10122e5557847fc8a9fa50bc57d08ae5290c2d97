<p>The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis were awarded
the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday in Sweden for showing that
two properties of quantum mechanics, the physical laws that rule
the subatomic realm, could be observed in a system large enough to
see with the naked eye.</p>

<p>“There is no advanced technology today that does not rely on
quantum mechanics,” Olle Eriksson, chairman of the Nobel Committee
for Physics, said during the announcement of the award. The
laureates’ discoveries, he added, paved the way for technologies
like the cellphone, cameras and fiber optic cables. It also helped
lay the groundwork for current attempts to build a quantum
computer, a device that could compute and process information at
speeds that would not be possible with classical computers.</p>

<p>Can you believe these woke dopes gave this award to three people, and not one of them is Donald Trump?</p>
