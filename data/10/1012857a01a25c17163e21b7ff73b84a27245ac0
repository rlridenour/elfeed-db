<p>The last remaining US-Russia agreement limiting deployed strategic nuclear weapons, New START, has expired, leaving the world’s two largest nuclear powers without a formal cap-and-inspection framework for the first time in decades. President Trump rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin’s call to voluntarily extend the treaty’s deployment caps and instead urged negotiations on a replacement, calling New START poorly negotiated and arguing for a “modernized” pact. Russia said it regretted the treaty’s expiration and cast a temporary extension of the limits as a stabilizing step. US officials, meanwhile, said Washington wants to talk about a new framework rather than carry over the old one. Several outlets noted that Trump also wants any future deal to include China, but Beijing has pushed back on joining a trilateral arms-control arrangement—making a quick replacement harder. The lapse is stirring worries among analysts and some US allies about less transparency and a renewed competition in warheads and delivery systems. Still, public statements from both Washington and Moscow suggest talks remain possible—one small but meaningful point of hope in an otherwise tense moment.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/C3KQfiNrTTIBQQjc3KzzP3mcbgaSp0i09jHh7qFh7y5tC0ku_6qE6HC5aG8WCbN2oWYeytLkUwRpgX7Pg_CwuxbKbHpuH34hDfomgkbIoutcXknDCwEicdvLW5kTUQo4hSBeMjXIGSw10H3T1roUsrU2RcpUHUIxa1ePovxf2xxEkcQ0vigCKWetInc' alt='President Trump meeting with President Vladimir V.
