<p>French prosecutors in Grenoble are asking potential victims and witnesses to come forward after charging a 79-year-old former teacher, Jacques Leveugle, with dozens of alleged rapes and sexual assaults against minors and underage boys. Authorities and media reports say the case spans more than five decades and nine countries. Officials made Leveugle’s identity public to support the witness appeal, with the goal of finding additional victims and clarifying the full scope of the alleged crimes, including possible survivors outside France.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PsyGT91q_4U9QolNTbHeu1tB0uGurNgGzmCLCBi_42qG2Sb2IrvNUQMqMxzDlUHSbQ0A0qLFT9GygDFMS_lboOVsDpFbMZYM7KUEcgPiIiWrak-yzQf2mVXGgQiB7N0nub3GS-zu_WxJiO5TO2W3d0KaawrqDM97SxV9ECcbH8lflnzNhQ' alt='A public wanted notice issued February 10, 2026, shows images of Jacques Leveugle as prosecutors seek additional witnesses.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Victim profile: Le Monde says the alleged victims were teenagers aged 13 to 17, and prosecutors describe dozens of alleged rapes and sexual assaults involving minors in that age range.</li><li>How the case surfaced: NDTV says investigators traced the suspect through digital material, including a USB drive, which helped uncover the alleged abuse and broaden the inquiry beyond the first leads.</li><li>Record trail: The BBC says investigators believe Leveugle kept a diary describing abuse, which authorities see as important for corroborating allegations and identifying potential victims.</li><li>Additional allegations: Euronews says Leveugle also confessed to two so-called “mercy killings,” opening a separate line of investigation alongside the sexual-abuse case.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Grenoble prosecutor’s office (per Le Monde): Prosecutor Etienne Manteaux said the alleged abuse targeted boys aged 13 to 17 across multiple locations, and he launched a witness appeal to find other possible victims.
