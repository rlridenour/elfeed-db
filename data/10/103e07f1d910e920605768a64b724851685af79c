<p>China’s leadership has launched a new wave of scrutiny inside the People’s Liberation Army after senior officer General Zhang Youxia, a vice chair of the Central Military Commission, was reported removed and placed under investigation for alleged “serious violations of discipline and law”. The case has revived questions about President Xi Jinping’s grip on military loyalty and the pace of his modernization agenda, which he has framed around a 2027 milestone. While some commentary points to corruption-driven housecleaning, others focus on internal power dynamics and the risk that uncertainty at the top can complicate how outside actors interpret Beijing’s intentions toward Taiwan and regional security.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/42B_LqUMumrCRzV1EthdnDxlDUrOmBQY5JP_MduA6IZ8lXBkUUTy-QXXhK-jgqH9ryveN8Bldia1vM3BceQOgmmDOlWECCp6_JWECVIDiuALAt1ib6KE2DMS36JtpEyoa_w_NaCR5GGGDiFGWeFzfvLzQCf3ilai2Isb5-JRcc3surgbLZvVPhyGp1JIbsHY7n5q9XupoD-VpiRewKGVZiShdCFlgkwUkYQRfFUFoSN2YphfTIpfNgyzgJXoxLzoB3sNAt2tC2-Oxp-xQw' alt='General Zhang Youxia, removed from China’s Central Military Commission, pictured with Xi Jinping (Dec. 4 photo).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Allegation swirl: One explanation circulating in commentary is an unproven claim that Zhang sold nuclear-related secrets to the United States, an allegation presented as a question rather than confirmed fact.</li><li>Loyalty policing: DW describes the wider military scandal as a loyalty-and-control test for Xi, with investigations into top deputies underscoring how political reliability remains central to advancement in the PLA.</li><li>Taiwan signaling: The Globe and Mail notes that Xi’s earlier decision to bring a modernization target forward to 2027 has fueled outside debate over what timeline, if any, Beijing is setting for being ready to use force against Taiwan—something Xi has denied, according to the article.</li><li>Speculation spike: The New York Times reports that the ouster of such a senior figure has triggered intense speculation about the motivations and the depth of the purge, reflecting the opacity surrounding PLA personnel decisions.</li><li>Faction tension: WSWS frames Zhang’s removal as evidence of sharp tensions within the military and the Communist Party leadership, emphasizing potential rivalry inside the Central Military Commission.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Chinese leadership (as portrayed by sources): The investigations are described as part of a continuing campaign to root out corruption and enforce discipline in the PLA’s top ranks.
