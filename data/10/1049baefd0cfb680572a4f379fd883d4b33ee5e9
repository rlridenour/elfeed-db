Previously I&rsquo;ve talked about the inability to refer to my code screens from within exwm if I&rsquo;m on a video call in my browser; it shows the option fo other browser windows, and the option of the whole screen, but not an emacs buffer. The solution is simple and beautifully recursive: run emacs within your exwm emacs.
Do what? Run emacs within your main exwm emacs session. M-S &amp; emacs.
