<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney publicly pushed back after President Trump said at the World Economic Forum that “Canada lives because of the United States”. Speaking after his Davos appearance and in remarks back in Canada, Carney argued that Canada’s success rests on its own values and institutions, while urging Canadians to defend sovereignty and strengthen border security. The comments come as Carney frames a shifting international environment as a test for “middle powers” and for national unity—an outlook that drew attention at Davos and resonated with supporters at home.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/hPyn6QKK9Aqc_iZMjc21w7_-m18N5XJ90pmWGzkra2yeHKCVfyhiAhSahQK2Be0B_TBtrzO-cR1Y7K2d6g7-3GGOiKvkAeoo4Ib9V1WM5Rfp_XHidGiuFUirfvscL2YuWYOSSKKG3z4_-jLpzmkkbTdXlajHvueK9ourJE8-8bVYJax8Sk2mc81QuRYzw7Is' alt='Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada at a news conference in Quebec City on Thursday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Davos framing: At Davos, Carney warned of a “rupture” in the U.S.-led, rules-based global order and criticized the use of economic “coercion” by great powers, remarks that received a standing ovation at the forum.</li><li>Middle-power strategy: Carney urged “middle powers” to work together to resist President Trump, according to reporting on his message after returning from the World Economic Forum.</li><li>National address: In a post-Davos national address delivered at a historic military fortress in Quebec City, Carney said Canada should “be a beacon to a world that’s at sea” and emphasized unity as global politics shift.</li><li>Trump’s critique: Trump’s remark was paired with a claim that Canada receives U.S. “freebies,” a line Carney rejected in his response.</li></ul><blockquote>Canada doesn&#x27;t live because of the United States. - Mark Carney</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Canada (Prime Minister Mark Carney): Carney says Canada should defend its sovereignty, secure its borders, and emphasize the country’s own values as the source of its strength.
