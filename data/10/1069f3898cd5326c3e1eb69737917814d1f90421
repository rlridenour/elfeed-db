Back in 2019, Nick Fitzgerald published always bump downwards, an article making the case that for bump allocators, bumping &ldquo;down&rdquo; (towards lower addresses) is better than bumping up. The biggest reasons for this are bumping up requires 3 branches vs 2 for bumping down and rounding down requires fewer instructions than rounding up. This became the method used for the popular bumpalo crate. In this post, I want to go back and revisit that analysis.
