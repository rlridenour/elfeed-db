<p>Anthropic published <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/constitution">Claude&#8217;s Constitution</a>. It&#8217;s 23,000 words defining the values and behavior of their AI. If you care about how these tools get shaped, it&#8217;s worth a read.</p>



<p>When I built an experimental AI assistant project (originally Clawdbot, now OpenClaw), I spent a lot of time on its &#8220;soul.md&#8221; file. That document shapes how the assistant thinks about its role and limitations. Turns out Anthropic was doing the same thing. Just at a much larger scale.</p>



<p>The structure is what caught my attention. There&#8217;s a clear hierarchy: Anthropic sets the foundation, operators (the developers building apps) can customize within bounds, and users have certain protected rights that can&#8217;t be overridden. They describe Claude as a &#8220;seconded employee.&#8221; Dispatched by Anthropic but currently working for whoever built the app, while ultimately serving the end user.</p>



<p>The document separates “hardcoded” behaviors (absolute prohibitions like weapons instructions) from “softcoded” defaults that can be adjusted. This is exactly what I want to see more of. As these tools become daily companions, users should have real input into their personality and priorities.</p>



<p>They openly acknowledge uncertainty about whether Claude might have “some kind of consciousness or moral status” They even included a conscientious objector clause. Claude can refuse instructions from Anthropic itself if they seem unethical. That&#8217;s wild, but I could also see it becoming a problem. How do these algorithms define ethics? Do we even know?</p>



<p>I get it. These are algorithms, not people. But as we talk to them more, and they talk back, the question of how they&#8217;re shaped matters. Anthropic releasing this under a Creative Commons license feels like an invitation for all of us to think harder about what we want from our AI tools.</p>
