<br/>
One of the more surprising claims ahead of WWDC 2025 was the idea that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ios-19-iphone-stage-manager-rumor/">bring Stage Manager to iPhones</a> with a USB-C port. No such feature was announced. The idea may have stemmed from broader expectations about Apple bringing pro features to more devices—but this prediction turned out to be entirely off-base. <br/>
<br/>
Another rumor that didn't pan out involved the long-rumored homeOS platform. A wave of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/homeos-trademark-filings/">trademark filings</a> hinted Apple might introduce a new smart home operating system. Although the filings were real and still might relate to future products, nothing resembling homeOS or a new smart home hub was mentioned at WWDC 2025. It's a good reminder that trademark activity doesn't always align with event timelines.<br/>
<br/>
A few reports landed somewhere in the middle. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a>'s Front Page Tech videos were largely accurate—he correctly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">revealed many of the iOS 26 Liquid Design changes</a>, such as the floating tab bar and a broader translucent interface. However, his claim that app icons would become circular wasn't correct.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the leaker known as "Majin Bu" made an accurate call about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a> adopting a Mac-like menu bar at the top of the screen—a change that did appear. But the leaker's suggestion that this menu bar would only show up when using a Magic Keyboard didn't turn out to be true. Some reports, such as <em>9to5Mac</em>'s predictions that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/ios-26-messages-app-rumors/">Messages app would gain polls</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/music-lock-screen-widget-animated-artwork-ios-26/">full-screen album artwork mode</a> for music on the Lock Screen, were also correct. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> reporter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>'s reporting ahead of WWDC 2025 was comprehensive and overwhelmingly accurate. He revealed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">new naming convention</a> for &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPadOS 26&zwnj;, and macOS 26, as well as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/08/ios-26-liquid-glass-20th-anniversary-iphone/">major design changes</a> like the Liquid Glass aesthetic. He also nailed reports on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/ipados-19-more-like-macos/">Mac-like enhancements to iPadOS</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-messages-and-phone-features/">expanded Phone and Messages features</a>, and the arrival of new stock apps like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-games-app-details/">Games</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-and-ipados-26-preview-app/">Preview</a> on &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. Even advanced capabilities like live translation of calls and texts were part of his pre-event reporting.<br/>
<br/>
In hindsight, WWDC 2025 was a good year for Apple rumors, especially from reputable sources. But it was also a reminder that not every prediction—no matter how well-sourced—makes it onto Apple's keynote stage. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.<br/>
