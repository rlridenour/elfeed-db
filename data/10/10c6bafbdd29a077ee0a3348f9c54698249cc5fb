An integrated version of <a href="https://protonvpn.com">Proton VPN</a> is now available in <a href="https://vivaldi.com/protonvpn/">Vivaldi's desktop browser</a>, thanks to a new partnership between the two companies. The direct integration means that from today, Vivaldi users can browse the web without needing to download a separate virtual private network (VPN).<br/>

After logging into their Vivaldi account, users can use Proton's free VPN which has no bandwidth limits, with the option to upgrade to a paid version. The free version  connect to servers in five randomly selected countries, and contains no ads, no data limits, and has a strict no-logs policy. <br/>
<br/>
Paid Proton VPN accounts can also be used within Vivaldi, and start at &#36;10 per month, offering faster VPN speeds, access to over 11,000 servers in over 110 countries, and other premium features. <br/>
<br/>
Proton VPN is also available in Chrome and Firefox as downloadable browser extensions, but Vivaldi makes the integration more seamless, at least on desktop – Proton VPN integration does not extend to the company's mobile browser.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that having a separate VPN client installed on your Mac is much more secure than a browser-integrated VPN, because this ensures that all of your internet traffic is funneled through the encrypted network, rather than just your browsing.<br/>

Vivaldi prides itself on its extensive customization options, such as tab tiling, Tab Stacks, web panels, and workspaces.
