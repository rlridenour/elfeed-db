<p>Upgrading Emacs is always a project, especially on macOS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Emacs Plus on my Mac since I installed version 28, but when I went to update to version 30.1 through homebrew, I got a cryptic git error. From the little research I did, it has to do with commits being in the wrong place. The explanation was something that went over my head, so I shrugged it off and tried <a href="https://emacsformacosx.com">Emacs for macOS</a> again. I forget what was the reason this Emacs flavor wasn&rsquo;t for me in the past, but it seems to work fine now. Well, after I deleted and reinstalled marginalia, exactly <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12809">as Irreal mentioned</a>. Seems to be working fine now.</p>
<p>I was excited about <code>completion-preview-mode</code> (if Mickey is raving about something, you got to check it out), but so far, in my experience, it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;meh,&rdquo; at least out of the box. After I got it to work in org-mode (the manual is a bit of a mess and seems to be thrown into the package itself, but I found out what to do in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZeoGVtMLaU&amp;t=94s">YouTube video</a>) it&rsquo;s not much better than what <code>company-mode</code> gives me at the moment, so I&rsquo;m going to wait until someone probably comes around with &ldquo;actually, it&rsquo;s much better because X, and you can find out how to do it over at Y,&rdquo; or Mickey writes something more complete. The video I mentioned goes into some helpful examples, but I get lost in terms of how to set it up in my case.</p>
<p>Then, again per Mickey, There&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Org URI protocol should now register automatically, meaning you can send data from a browser bookmarklet straight into org capture in your running Emacs instance.&rdquo; I remember I once got it (or something similar) to work with org protocol, but a native option turned on like this seems very good, and I&rsquo;d love to be able to send text and links from my browser directly to Emacs. I&rsquo;m not sure how to get this to work either. I recall I need to run Emacs as a server in the background and then launch Emacs as a client, but this is beyond my current macOS kung fu. The issue with finding how is usually knowing what to look for. I need to be more specific about my research, but i&rsquo;m not sure what it is I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>
<p>Upgrading Emacs is always rewarding because I also get to upgrade my brain with it. I learn how to do new things, and do them more effectively. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be back at tweaking pretty soon.</p>
