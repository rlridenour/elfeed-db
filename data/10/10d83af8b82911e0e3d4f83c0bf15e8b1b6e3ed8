Intro One of the great pieces of advice I received for setting up Dvorak keys was to swap C-x and C-u keys, and the following snippet does just that.
;; Dvorak settings (keyboard-translate ?\C-u ?\C-x) (keyboard-translate ?\C-x ?\C-u) I had hoped that a simple replacement of the the C with M would make that change for Meta, too, since M-x is common and awkward on Dvorak. However, that gave me a type error.
