<p>NASA released fresh close-up images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS and said the visitor is a comet — not an alien spacecraft — based on telescope and spacecraft observations. Scientists say 3I/ATLAS likely formed in another star system more than eight billion years ago, making it older than our solar system, and that its composition so far appears similar to solar system comets (carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, cyanide and detectable nickel). The object poses no threat to Earth and will pass no closer than about 269–275 million kilometres from our planet before heading back into interstellar space.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/VBI8ohYW2N1has8Ic-TZQMxygDaZ3donpt4xWRNOY341S-Ae1bcYmsbh0TQVkG-8xsL8NQKXQ10hh_2l-xamJX-ObRYPLTBx9_nysTxusHgT' alt='An image from the HiRISE camera aboard NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on October 2 — Reuters' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Discovery details: 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July by an ATLAS telescope at Rio Hurtado, Chile, and astronomers have tracked it intensively since discovery.</li><li>Planned briefing: NASA officials scheduled a briefing in Greenbelt, Maryland to present new imagery gathered by ground telescopes and spacecraft instruments.</li><li>Mars flyby imagery: The HiRISE camera aboard NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter photographed 3I/ATLAS as it passed near Mars on October 2, producing some of the close-up views now released.</li><li>Composition surprise: Analyses show unusually high nickel alongside common comet molecules, a pattern seen previously in interstellar comet 2I/Borisov and in some solar system comets.</li></ul><blockquote>This is a comet that formed in another solar system, most likely more than eight billion years ago - which means it is older than our solar system, and the oldest thing we’ve ever seen close up - Chris Lintott</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>NASA officials: NASA described 3I/ATLAS as a &#x27;friendly solar system visitor&#x27; and rejected speculation it is an alien spacecraft, emphasizing the imagery supports a natural cometary origin.
