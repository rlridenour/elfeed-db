<p>Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, cruised to a landslide in a snap lower-house election. The win gives her a two-thirds supermajority, strengthening her mandate in Tokyo. Reported projections and tallies varied by outlet: several reports put the LDP at about 316 seats in the 465-seat House of Representatives—enough to clear the two-thirds threshold used to override the upper chamber, while Al Jazeera described the result in a 500-member house. Takaichi says she wants to move quickly on promised tax cuts and fiscal stimulus. Markets welcomed the clarity that comes with a strong majority, and Japanese shares and the Nikkei hit record levels after the result. With the opposition weakened, analysts and outlets across the spectrum say the win also clears space for a more conservative agenda—especially a renewed push to revise Japan’s postwar constitution, alongside higher defense spending and tougher stances on immigration and China. The outcome quickly echoed beyond Japan. China warned it would respond “resolutely” and urged Tokyo to retract comments related to Taiwan, while India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Takaichi and highlighted the India–Japan partnership’s role in “peace, stability and prosperity”.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/YXAREhEuQtZ0EaQQ60MwSZLkTNgyaxFVv0_rkv8qfwNJryUgxugd-6hhZfxZYyXLvdSDYudGXjh94BddqYGYokUFcyisHuEwwW-EWCTP0yOCmRqCgUMpn6MFPeqrICo-w2bfT1UNenLGP0Kv-x50SDUJyqmYnI9K171bn3ICCXprC5LSKCmEK-d7JZWt4yGg' alt='Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi after exit polls projected a supermajority for her party.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Coalition arithmetic: NHK projections cited by SCMP suggested the LDP could clear the lower-house two-thirds line even before counting coalition partners, underscoring how fragmented the opposition remains after the snap vote.</li><li>Constitution push: After the win, Takaichi singled out constitutional change as a priority—a long-running conservative goal that critics and analysts say could reshape Japan’s defense posture beyond current postwar constraints.</li><li>Foreign policy: Some commentary said the supermajority strengthens Takaichi’s hand to hold a hard line on China while pursuing even closer security and trade ties with the United States.</li><li>Voter caution: Analysts and Japanese editorial voices cautioned that a landslide does not necessarily mean a blank check for once-fringe security ideas, including debate around nuclear weapons capability.</li><li>Domestic risks: Analysts quoted in coverage warned that leaning into a hardline conservative platform could narrow the LDP’s support base over time—even after this decisive victory.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi: After the election, she vowed to deliver promised tax cuts and said she felt a “heavy responsibility” as she moved to advance her agenda, including exploring constitutional change.
