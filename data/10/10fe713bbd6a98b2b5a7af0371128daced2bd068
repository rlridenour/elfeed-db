For reasons that I&rsquo;ll explain below, this is not an informed post. Rather, I&rsquo;m just passing along something that I found on the Web and <i>that</i> was merely one man&rsquo;s opinion. Still, it seems like useful information so I&rsquo;m repeating it here but <i>caveat emptor</i> is definitely called for.

Over at the Emacs subreddit, kmlkclkmlkcl says that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1mj8fjc/eglot_is_good/">after two years he&rsquo;s changed from LSP-mode to Eglot</a> and he&rsquo;s really happy with the change. He says, &ldquo;It just works&rdquo;,  feels like it&rsquo;s part of Emacs and not a third party app, and that unlike LSP-mode it was easy to configure and get working.

As I say, this is uninformed commentary on my part. Probably because I&rsquo;ve spent most of my programming career programming in C and various Lisp dialects, I&rsquo;ve never felt the need for LSP mediated programming. I know you can use it with C but why bother? There aren&rsquo;t objects with a ton of methods to negotiate. At most you have to deal with some libraries but to an experienced C programmer, these become second nature.

Added to that, I <i>really</i> hate having my editor pop up miscellaneous information—it&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t use the automatic completion so beloved by others—so the last thing I want is my editor telling me what function or method to call. I prefer to be left alone when I program; it&rsquo;s probably why the idea of pair programming fills me with loathing and dread.

<p>
The point of all this is that I&rsquo;m the last person to ask about the relative merits of LSP applications. But I <i>do</i> think kmlkclkmlkcl has some useful information so I&rsquo;m passing it on.</p>
