         <p>In this video I talk to port19 about repetitive strain injury related
to computer usage. I am introduced to the experience port19 went
through, with pain in the hands and fingers. I ask about the computing
setup that first contributed to the problem and learn how
keyboard-driven it was. port19 covers the progression to a split
mechanical keyboard, learning about specialised exercises to work out
the relevant muscles, as well as reading about research on the
psychosomatic factors involved. We eventually get to the topic of the
custom keyboard port19 uses right now (the ZSA Voyager) and talk about
all the details involved, from the weight of the switches to the
typing angle, the use of layers to access certain characters, and the
placement of modifier keys. To have a complete picture of the
ergonomics port19 has considered, I also ask about the overall desk
setup and the computer use overall. Once we cover this topic, we
discuss how dictation software makes it easier to avoid the keyboard
altogether while still being productive: port19 explains the relevant
setup with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffmpeg</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">whisper</code> program of OpenAI and shares the
script for it. Towards the end of our talk, I ask port19 about the
switch away from the IT sector into geriatric nursing. I learn about
how things are in that field and what the experience is like.</p>
