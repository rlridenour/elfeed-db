</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Each morning I wake to a south eastern view of a small lake.  The night to day transition bringing about moments serene.
</p>
        <p><span class="new-thought">Awake early and read for a spell</span> I sit and clatter on my keyboard.  I
started my morning reading a few chapters of <i class="new-thought">I finished reading</i> <cite data-id="74f46596-7e82-4fe7-9921-a60da8c558c0">William Blake and the Sea Monsters of Love</cite> by Philip Hoare.</p>
<p>Our house pregnant with our visiting children, not yet birthed into this waiting
morning.  I alone stir, expectant of the day ahead.  I woke in that hour of the
changing of the guards, when light has arrived but night hurriedly tidies up
after itself.</p>
<p>I looked on the lake, and saw a thin wispy fog just above the waterline, as
though a procession of epineuston souls.  In that moment of the sun not yet
cresting the treeline but having fully restored the days color, the lake takes
on different airs: mist and calm.</p>
<p>I offer a morning haiku:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>Mites of fog skimming<br />
rippling wake now funerate<br />
amidst morning fire<br /></p>
</div>
