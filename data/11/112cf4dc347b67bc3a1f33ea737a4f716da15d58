<blockquote><p>
  Amazon’s Prime Video app just got a big update on Apple TV. The app is now better optimized for tvOS, allowing you to swipe on the Siri Remote to scroll through Prime Video’s shows and movies as well as use touchpad gestures for fast-forwarding, rewinding, and scrubbing through content.

<p>As Joe Rosensteel <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/apple-should-embrace-the-live-tv-grid-fast/">pointed out just yesterday</a>, one of the things Amazon does really well is live TV. The new app seems to have more “On now” signifiers (pointing to live channels) and offers a really solid live guide.</p>
<p>There was a time when Prime Video was one of the worst major streamer apps on tvOS, but those days are over.</p>
