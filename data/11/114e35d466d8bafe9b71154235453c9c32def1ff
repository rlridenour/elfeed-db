<p>Today&#8217;s sponsor is&nbsp;<a href="https://timingapp.com/">Timing</a>, and if you&#8217;ve ever wondered where the afternoon went, this app has answers.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve written a lot about hyper-scheduling and blocking time for important work. But there&#8217;s a gap between the plan and reality. You schedule two hours for writing, but did you actually write? Or did you spend forty minutes in email and another twenty &#8220;researching&#8221; something that turned into a YouTube rabbit hole? Without data, you&#8217;re guessing.</p>



<p>Timing fills that gap. It runs in the background on your Mac, quietly logging which apps and documents get your attention. You set up rules once (Scrivener equals writing, Safari on specific sites equals research) and Timing handles the rest. No timers to start. No timers to forget. Just an honest record of where your hours actually land.</p>



<p>The newest feature is AI-powered summaries. Instead of sifting through a raw timeline, Timing groups related activities and highlights what you worked on. Open the app at 5 PM and get a clear picture of your day in seconds. For anyone doing the shutdown ritual, this is gold.</p>



<p>Timing also pulls in Screen Time data from your iPhone and iPad, so you see everything in one place. And it detects when video calls end, prompting you to log that time. If you bill clients or just want accountability, that coverage matters.</p>



<p>This is a proper native Mac app. Local data by default, fast interface, no Electron bloat. Plans start at $9/month for Professional. Expert ($11/month) adds the AI summaries and Screen Time sync. Connect ($16/month) brings team features. All plans include a 30-day free trial.</p>



<p>You can&#8217;t improve what you don&#8217;t measure. Check out&nbsp;<a href="https://timingapp.com/">Timing</a>&nbsp;and find out where your time really goes.</p>
