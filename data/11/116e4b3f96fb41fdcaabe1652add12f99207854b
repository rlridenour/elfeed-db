I use EXWM and three monitors, so knowing my window numbers is crucial to my navigation. I used to use Ace Window to present a red digit at the corner of emacs screens with which number to press to get there. The two problems with this are that you can&rsquo;t know your numbers until you invoke Ace Windows, and more damningly, you can&rsquo;t get these numbers on exwm (non-emacs) windows, such as my ever-present browsers.
