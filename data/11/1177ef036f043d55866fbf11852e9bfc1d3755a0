  <p>A bit of sad news for old iPods: Macs might be losing FireWire
support.</p>

<p>The first macOS Tahoe developer beta does not support the legacy
FireWire 400 and FireWire 800 data-transfer standards, according
to <a href="https://x.com/NekoMichiUBC/status/1932876748661608561">@NekoMichi on X</a>, and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1l7gb1r/macos_tahoe_dp1_seems_remove_firewire_800_support/">Reddit post</a>. As a result,
the first few iPod models and old external storage drives that
rely on FireWire cannot be synced with or mounted on a Mac running
the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-macos-tahoe-developer-beta/">macOS Tahoe beta</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike on macOS Sequoia and earlier versions, the first macOS
Tahoe beta does not include a FireWire section in the System
Settings app.</p>

<p>All good things must come to an end, and FireWire was a very good thing indeed. High-performance, reliable, easy to use.</p>

<p>Apple, back in 2001, “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2001/08/22Apple-FireWire-Wins-2001-Primetime-Emmy-Engineering-Award/">Apple FireWire Wins 2001 Primetime Emmy Engineering Award</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s FireWire technology will be honored by the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences in an awards presentation held tonight
at the academy’s Goldenson Theatre in Hollywood. Apple will
receive a 2001 Primetime Emmy Engineering Award for FireWire’s
material impact on the television industry.</p>

<p>Apple invented FireWire in the mid-90s and shepherded it to become
the established cross-platform industry standard IEEE 1394.
FireWire is a high-speed serial input/output technology for
connecting digital devices such as digital camcorders and cameras
to desktop and portable computers. Widely adopted by digital
peripheral companies such as Sony, Canon, JVC and Kodak, FireWire
has become the established industry standard for both consumers
and professionals.</p>
