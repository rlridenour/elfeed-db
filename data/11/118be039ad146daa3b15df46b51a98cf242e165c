If you&rsquo;re an Emacser who writes in LaTeX you&rsquo;re doubtless familiar with AUCTeX. Most of the time, you can depend on Org mode to do the heaving lifting but when you have a complicated layout you may have to invoke AUCTeX.
</p>
<p>
Randy Ridenour, a professor at Oklahoma Baptist University, writes in LaTeX using AUCTeX and, of course, wanted to configure it using John Wiegley&rsquo;s <code>use-package</code> macro. He did what we&rsquo;d all do:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">use-package</span> tex
    <span style="color: #483d8b;">:ensure</span> auctex)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
but it didn&rsquo;t work. It turns you have to do
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">use-package</span> tex-site
    <span style="color: #483d8b;">:ensure</span> auctex)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
instead.
</p>
<p>
When I saw his post, it rang a bell so I checked my config and I do the exact same thing. I vaguely remember going through the same steps as Ridenour years ago. I no longer recall how I discovered the magic spell but I doubtless found it on the Web somewhere. Ridenour&rsquo;s problem was getting things to work with <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/skim-app/">Skim</a>. I&rsquo;ve never used Skim so I had some other problem but the answer was the same.
</p>
<p>
Once I fixed the problem, I just moved on and so have no idea why you need <code>tex-site</code> instead of <code>tex</code>. I&rsquo;m sure one of Irreal&rsquo;s well informed readers will jump in with the answer.
</p>
<p>
I know this trip down memory lane isn&rsquo;t all that interesting to most of you but I&rsquo;m writing about it for the same reason that Ridenour did: to help someone else struggling with the problem find the answer.</p>
