<p>The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution on Friday backing Morocco’s proposal to grant Western Sahara &quot;genuine autonomy&quot; under Moroccan sovereignty, in a move promoted by the United States . The text frames Morocco’s 2007 autonomy plan as the main reference point for negotiations and urges talks &quot;without preconditions,&quot; a shift that Rabat calls a diplomatic victory .
