<p>Bangladesh’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its allies appear to have won a decisive parliamentary majority in the country’s first national election since the 2024 youth-led uprising that removed longtime leader Sheikh Hasina. Multiple outlets said the BNP-led bloc cleared the 151-seat threshold in the 300-seat Jatiya Sangsad. Reuters and others cited projections of about 209 seats—enough for a commanding mandate—while official results were still being compiled. Tarique Rahman, the BNP chairman who returned to Bangladesh in December after roughly 17 years in exile, is now positioned to become prime minister, bringing the party back to power after about two decades. Several sources cast the vote as an early measure of Bangladesh’s democratic reset—and its ability to steady itself after months of unrest that disrupted daily life and key industries. Still, the contest drew criticism and friction: Hasina called the election not credible, and some accounts reported isolated violence during the campaign and on polling day. Early signals from abroad suggest key partners want to work quickly with the incoming leadership if the handover stays peaceful—an early hint that regional diplomacy may shift from crisis management toward practical cooperation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/hC61POlEBgKKT_9FKw0d1ja3hHqhmsvVhbA7HzSJGsPFT29bYVzvJIljmEEjR-EiQOUE6YtBtV7RGADcFpHGTTyqQqvUGaZ-l3EjLO4qECY1C6loQhc7kH2xdqP-z85M9YbFO3fsroaga8shskcMrcPS0HNsgtbdcmVebYuVm7KDDpDIdUBovgMC1DDWAGAGkiwOAepWOQ' alt='Tarique Rahman in a Reuters photo used in election coverage.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Seat picture: Broadcasters and wire reports projected the BNP-led coalition winning roughly two-thirds of the 300 seats (about 209).
