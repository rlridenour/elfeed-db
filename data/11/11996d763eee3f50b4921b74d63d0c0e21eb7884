<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>Virtual Dissertation Groups</strong> (VDG) is shifting to a summer schedule for 2025. Sign ups for this summers’ groups are open through Saturday, May 10<sup>th</sup> <a href="http://www.jasmartphilosophy.com/virtual-dissertation-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>here</strong></a>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>What it is</strong>: Virtual Dissertation Groups is a free service for those currently working on their doctoral dissertations in philosophy departments (or philosophy of science or the like). Since 2014, VDG has connected students from over 30 countries to provide low-stakes peer feedback on dissertation work with a minimal time commitment.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>How it works</strong>: Dissertators are organized into groups of three, based on information provided about their project/area of work. Once a month for June-August, one of the members takes a turn sending work from their dissertation (3k–6k words) to the other two for feedback. (Feedback is typically in the form of written comments, though some groups choose to have video discussions.)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: While advisors and committees are important, it can be incredibly helpful to discuss one’s work with peers in a lower-stakes environment, and particularly enlightening to do so with those who have a different approach, outlook, or focus. There is even some <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scientificamerican.com%2Farticle%2Fan-easy-way-to-increase-c%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9PuFc2mA8KedsV2tirWRDuus8SA">evidence from psychology</a> that thinking about problems in relation to geographically distant persons can promote creative insights. With students at a variety of programs and from around the world, VDG is a great way to capture some of these benefits!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Signing up is easy, just fill out a few brief questions on your project <a href="www.jasmartphilosophy.com/virtual-dissertation-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>here</strong></a>. Hope to see you there!</em></p>
