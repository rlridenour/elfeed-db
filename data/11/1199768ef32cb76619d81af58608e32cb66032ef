<p>Ukraine says delegations from Ukraine, Russia and the United States will hold their first trilateral talks in the United Arab Emirates on January 23–24, with Abu Dhabi cited as the venue. The discussions come as President Trump’s envoys travel to Moscow, and as Trump met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Davos, both describing their conversation as &quot;good&quot; while reiterating the war should end. Zelensky said terms for security guarantees had been finalized, but he said the territorial question remains unresolved, underscoring that major issues still need bridging even as dialogue expands. While the path ahead remains uncertain, the move toward direct, structured contacts offers a practical opening to reduce risks and test whether compromises are possible.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/HFSCoE2X3MrUW2jNXvfkqgq4_hJrGpWqsocmGodg92DvYa8Y4W_UvxBiAE-Jss2FkOJt9cTsX5MyvL6p24EY4gy6x1NczU7hIZPwCugKmrXsRpijaNuljTu2dFr94QIyV2fJgpTh7wW1UWsECd4XGnjqgjStsFJ2Zme3gRyviGb4b0vqXSwXdizQCXJf90RnIYyq0CqYxWoa4mzpvVJYTBYCoOPaESkdzBkGM8C-QE7CDBg-qp_DbEVPpyUiItDqVMM2xl1fY8cZ-f55pg' alt='Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and U.S. President Donald Trump pose for a photo during their meeting at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, January 22, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who may attend: Russia said its delegation would be led by Admiral Igor Kostyukov, head of the GRU military intelligence, with Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov announcing a trilateral security working group meeting in Abu Dhabi.</li><li>US track: Politico reported US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner planned to see President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and then continue the process in the UAE via &quot;military-to-military&quot; working groups, as described by Witkoff.</li><li>Trump diplomacy: The Financial Times reported President Trump’s envoys would travel to Moscow to discuss the idea of a trilateral meeting, part of Washington’s push for direct Russia-Ukraine engagement.</li><li>Zelensky tone: Zelensky told audiences in Davos that &quot;Russians have to be ready for compromises&quot; and framed dialogue as preferable to no contact at all.</li><li>Europe critique: Firstpost reported Zelensky criticized Europe at Davos for a slow response to Russia’s invasion and urged more decisive action alongside the diplomatic track.</li></ul><blockquote>Russians have to be ready for compromises — everybody has to be ready, not only Ukraine - Volodymyr Zelenskyy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine (President Volodymyr Zelensky): Zelensky said the trilateral talks would take place in the UAE, welcomed dialogue as better than none, and said security-guarantee terms were finalized while the territorial issue remained unresolved.
