<p>In the latest development in the U.S.-Greenland dispute, President Trump said he will not use force to acquire Greenland and withdrew a threatened tariff push against European allies, while describing a new “framework” with NATO for a future Arctic security arrangement. Denmark and Greenland responded that Greenland’s sovereignty is not negotiable, even as Trump said the framework would give the U.S. “total access” to the territory. Reporting suggests discussions have included ideas such as granting the U.S. special sovereignty-like arrangements over specific military base areas and possibly access tied to minerals, but officials and leaders have emphasized that final terms remain unclear and would require further negotiation. While some European leaders expressed relief at the de-escalation, lawmakers and analysts warned the episode could still strain trust within NATO and the broader transatlantic relationship.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/0Xazu-55vqne00E_VLC480Av-gZpop9h0VA23dGt0ukg1sCB4mQx3UpvvjS8b6qi5CAUA3a6IOSQet7xPqE37fYDiS0X8vYdKqT-HCOPS1s7N32Q9brnqt1SvqjrPpYnd4ncy24LNDBP_OBYbAN7PmVX35A3o6okGnGnHyglw3WibsBCPbCtmBf96qv5T05c0T00p5wdBE4InsiwCSUF8Xz8DBixMrkSGyWoe6OC3c4' alt='Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in Copenhagen, after rejecting sovereignty talks over Greenland.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Davos setting: Trump delivered his remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, criticizing several leaders before later emphasizing “I won’t use force,” a shift that reporters described as an abrupt de-escalation.</li><li>Base-sovereignty idea: American and NATO officials have discussed a concept that would give the U.S. sovereignty-like control over limited areas for military bases in Greenland, compared by one official to the U.K.’s base areas in Cyprus.</li><li>Greenland openness: Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Greenland is “ready to negotiate” a better partnership with the U.S., but described sovereignty as a “red line”.</li><li>NATO posture: Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen backed a NATO “permanent presence” around Greenland and described Arctic security as an alliance-wide matter.</li><li>European calculus: EU leaders discussed how to respond after the U-turn, with some describing concerns about being pressured while also welcoming the pause in escalation and tariff threats.</li></ul><blockquote>It&#x27;s hard to un-ring the bell, - Rep.
