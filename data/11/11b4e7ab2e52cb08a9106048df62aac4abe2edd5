<p>Venezuela has freed more than 100 political detainees in a nationwide release process, according to the rights group Foro Penal, with relatives gathering outside prisons to await confirmation and reunite with loved ones. Interim leader Delcy Rodríguez has pledged to continue releases since taking office on January 5, as international pressure—particularly from Washington—has intensified in the wake of the U.S. seizure of Nicolás Maduro, several outlets report. Even as families celebrate some reunions, other relatives and rights groups say dozens of people remain detained without clear information on their whereabouts, keeping a painful search ongoing.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/9-lS26Ga5k4xTmFgldA9AW-1uPsZf7ZajlGwE65EuqeFiz-Gj4Q2YPln6H6NciTxobfTV9528-74L9wcN651zYyOqupN1sou8WwXp8Z0mEyLMGQSsSBlWcHCDNT8z3TrRkudgpJ55IBsxOtAp_WVUQKmFQlkpVcgaHLkHFOLvYv0puZ7kLsoly9dA8zGMD6VxagbHqZGtwPx26I7uGJVKt0jAzfFpoEaa9l1iseL-PL52lIIlSmSo8Y' alt='Carlos Andres Perez embraces his cousin upon release from prison in Venezuela, on Sunday, January 25, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Counts vary: Foro Penal reported a rolling tally that different outlets put at “at least 80” freed on Sunday and “at least 104” freed nationwide as identities were still being verified.</li><li>Who was freed: Foro Penal said those released included a human rights lawyer and a communications student, highlighting that detainees came from varied backgrounds.</li><li>Families waiting: Relatives camped outside multiple detention centers during what Foro Penal described as a slow-moving process, with releases happening across facilities rather than in one place.</li><li>Missing relatives: Rights groups and families cited at least 66 cases of people taken by state authorities who have not been heard from again, even as other detainees have been released.</li><li>US pressure: Several reports link the releases to heightened U.S. leverage after American forces seized Maduro in a raid, a development that has reshaped Venezuela’s political landscape in recent weeks.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Foro Penal (rights group): The NGO says releases are underway nationwide but verification is ongoing and the process has been slow, leaving families waiting outside prisons for confirmation.
