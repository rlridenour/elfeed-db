<p>Some words become famous for their implausibly specific definitions:</p>
<p><em>ucalegon</em>: a neighbor whose house is on fire<br />
<em>nosarian</em>: one who argues that there is no limit to the possible largeness of a nose<br />
<em>undoctor</em>: to make unlike a doctor</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781559722339"><em>Mrs. Byrne&#8217;s Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure, and Preposterous Words</em></a>, by Josefa Heifetz Byrne, collects examples ranging from <em>atpatruus</em> (&#8220;a great-grandfather&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s brother&#8221;) to <em>zumbooruk</em> (&#8220;a small cannon fired from the back of a camel&#8221;). My own favorite is <em>groak</em>, &#8220;to watch people silently while they&#8217;re eating, hoping they will ask you to join them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alas, most of these don&#8217;t appear in the magisterial <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>. Accordingly, in 1981 Jeff Grant burrowed his way into the <em>OED</em> in a deliberate search for obscure words. When he reached the end of A he sent his 10 favorite finds to the British magazine <em>Logophile</em>:</p>
<p><em>acersecomic</em>: one whose hair was never cut<br />
<em>acroteriasm</em>: the act of cutting off the extreme parts of the body, when putrefied, with a saw<br />
<em>alerion</em>: an eagle without beak or feet<br />
<em>all-flower-water</em>: cow&#8217;s urine, as a remedy<br />
<em>ambilevous</em>: left-handed on both sides<br />
<em>amphisbaenous</em>: walking equally in opposite directions<br />
<em>andabatarian</em>: struggling while blindfolded<br />
<em>anemocracy</em>: government by wind<br />
<em>artolatry</em>: the worship of bread<br />
<em>autocoprophagous</em>: eating one&#8217;s own dung</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been working slowly through &#8216;B&#8217; and so far my favourite is definitely &#8216;bangstry&#8217;, defined as &#8216;masterful violence&#8217;, an obsolete term that is surely overdue for a comeback.&#8221;</p>
