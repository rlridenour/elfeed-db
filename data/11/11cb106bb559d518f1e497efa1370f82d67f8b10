<p>Hookmark just added Linkding integration, and I&rsquo;m really excited about it. It&rsquo;s a perfect complement to the local bookmarking that Hookmark makes possible.</p>

<p>I love <a href="https://hookproductivity.com/">Hookmark</a>, and it&rsquo;s getting easier to explain as it develops. With Hookmark, you can connect any objects on your Mac to each other, from todo items to documents to notes to web pages. One of the cool features it&rsquo;s had for a while is sync with <a href="https://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, where any time you create or copy a link, it generates a Pinboard bookmark automatically. Very handy. But I switched from Pinboard to a <a href="https://bookmarks.scoffb.in">self-hosted Linkding instance</a> a little while ago and lost this integration. I took a shot in the dark and asked Luc to add Linkding integration to Hookmark, and guess what? Here it is.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to turn the rest of this post over to Luc Beaudoin to explain more.</p>

<p>When it comes to organizing digital knowledge, fast and fluid access is everything. That’s why I’m thrilled to share how <a href="https://hookproductivity.com">Hookmark</a>, the contextual linking app from <a href="https://CogSciApps.com">CogSci Apps</a>, which I co-founded, now integrates seamlessly with <a href="https://linkding.link/">Linkding</a> &mdash; a modern, open-source alternative to legacy bookmarking services like Pinboard.</p>

<p>I’ve written previously on <a href="https://hookproductivity.com/blog/2025/03/hookmark-6-8-with-linkding-bookmarking-mysleepbutton-and-more/">Hookmark’s Linkding support</a>, but this post dives deeper for readers of BrettTerpstra.com &mdash; people who appreciate tools that stay out of the way while leveling up your digital workflow.</p>

<h3 id="why-linkding">Why Linkding?</h3>

<p>Pinboard has long been a favorite among power users, but it’s been stagnant for years. Its API works, but innovation has ground to a halt. In contrast, Linkding is an active, community-driven project with features that rival and even surpass Pinboard:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Modern UI</strong> with responsive design</li>
  <li><strong>Open source and self-hostable</strong>—ideal for those who value control and privacy</li>
  <li><strong>Tagging, search, notes, and favicons</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Active development</strong> with new features and fixes arriving regularly</li>
</ul>

<p>While Linkding&rsquo;s default interface is minimal and functional, it supports customization through CSS. Users can tailor the UI to their preferences, and community contributions &mdash; such as <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/11/18/a-card-based-layout-for-linkding/">Brett&rsquo;s card-based layout</a>, &mdash;showcase the flexibility of Linkding&rsquo;s design</p>

<p>In short, Linkding feels like what Pinboard could have become, had it kept pace with the needs of today’s knowledge workers.</p>

<h3 id="hookmark-meets-linkding">Hookmark Meets Linkding</h3>

<p><a href="https://hookproductivity.com">Hookmark</a> lets you create persistent links between almost anything on your Mac—files, emails, web pages, tasks, you name it. Think of it as a universal “Copy Link” and “Hook to Copied Link” engine that helps you build a network of contextual references across all your tools.</p>

<p>With Hookmark’s Linkding integration, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Add bookmarks to linkdking automatically</strong>: Whenever you copy or hook a link with Hookmark, it automatically adds a bookmark in its own database and syncs the bookmark to Linkding</li>
  <li><strong>Automatically name links</strong>: Hookmark grabs the page title from Linkding, so your hooks are always readable.</li>
  <li><strong>Use your own infrastructure</strong>: If you self-host Linkding, you maintain full control over your links—with zero dependence on third-party services.</li>
</ul>

<p>This integration is perfect for developers, researchers, writers, or anyone who works with a web of information and wants it just a keystroke away.</p>

<h3 id="practical-example">Practical Example</h3>

<p>Let’s say you’ve saved a Linkding bookmark to a key <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/">Apple documentation page</a>. With Hookmark, you can &ldquo;hook&rdquo; (i.e., bidirectionally link)  that directly to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A note in Obsidian or Bear</li>
  <li>A task in OmniFocus or Things</li>
  <li>A project folder in Finder</li>
  <li>A local markdown file</li>
</ul>

<p>Hooking a file automatically bookmarks it in your Linkding database. Now, whenever you’re in that file or app, you’re just one click or shortcut away from jumping to that bookmarked web page—even if you closed your browser days ago.</p>

<p>That’s what Hookmark is all about: reducing friction in your workflow by linking the resources that matter <em>in context</em>.</p>

<h3 id="try-it-out">Try It Out</h3>

<p>To enable the integration:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/04/hookmark-config-800.png"></p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding#installation">Install Linkding</a> (self-hosted or via a service like Docker or CapRover)</li>
  <li>Configure Linkding in Hookmark&rsquo;s Settings -&gt; Services (get your API key from the Settings -&gt; Integrations page in your Linkding)</li>
  <li>Use Hookmark’s “Copy Link” or “Hook to Copied Link” on any web page</li>
  <li>Enjoy effortless navigation between your local and online resources, as well as archived bookmarks of pages in your Linkding</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="were-in-motion">We&rsquo;re in motion</h3>

<p>Like Linkding, Hookmark is not standing still. We intend to add more integration with bookmarking services, such as synchronizing tags between Hookmark and Linkding — in both directions. We will also provide a mechanism to import all your Linkding bookmarks into Hookmark&ndash;including their tags. We&rsquo;ll add the ability to add a note to your bookmark, and sync the note with Linkding.</p>

<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p>In a time when knowledge is scattered across apps, tabs, and cloud services, tools like Hookmark and Linkding help us <em>re-own</em> our information space. Their integration brings together the best of contextual computing and modern bookmarking.</p>

<p>If you value clarity, speed, and autonomy in your digital workflows, give <a href="https://hookproductivity.com/">Hookmark</a> + Linkding a spin. You might never go back.</p>
