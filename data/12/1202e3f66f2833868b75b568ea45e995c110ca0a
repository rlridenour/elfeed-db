<p>Can I tell you something? I have been cackling to myself about this joke for hours. And I’m not ashamed.</p>
<p>Look. They’re lanterns, okay?</p>
<p>I’ve been trying so hard to maintain this bit about how you can never have too many lanterns. And it’s getting harder and harder, but in my heart of hearts, I still believe it.</p>
<p>If you bought lanterns every time we’ve sold them, you would have, at this point, a lot of lanterns. But they’d be stashed away somewhere most of the time, out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p>Then, when it came time for a camping trip with you, the family, and some family friends, how cool would you look if you could bust out a lantern for every camper?</p>
<p>Or let’s say there’s a power outage. Everyone in the family could get two lanterns for their room, plus you could put one in each bathroom and lend a few to the neighbors.</p>
<p>Or you could have one for the basement, one for the garage, one in your car, one in your spouse’s car, one by the door in case you need to run out and grab something in the shed after the sun goes down. And still have some left over for the two above scenarios!</p>
<p>Just buy some lanterns, please. Buy them all.</p>
<p>Because if we sell out of lanterns, I won’t have to write about lanterns anymore.</p>
