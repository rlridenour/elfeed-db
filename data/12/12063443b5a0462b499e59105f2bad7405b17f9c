<p>Perhaps you’ve heard the tempest in a wall wart over Apple not including a charger in the MacBook Pro in Europe. While <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/10/15/eu-gets-what-it-asked-for-there-is-no-charger-in-the-macbook-pro-box">some</a> have been <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/16/m5-mbp-no-power-adapter-in-europe">quick</a> to blame this on EU regulation, it’s a little more complex than that. Nick Heer <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/macbook-pro-charger-brouhaha/">does an admirable job</a> unpacking this whole brouhaha:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  First of all, the dollar is not the currency in any of these countries. Second, the charger in European countries is €65, which is more like $76 right now. Third, Apple is allowed to bundle an A.C. adapter, it just needs to offer an option to not include it. Fourth, and most important, is that the new MacBook Pro is less expensive in nearly every region in which the A.C. adapter is now a configure-to-order option — even after adding the adapter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s plenty of cynicism to go around here: some want to point fingers at Apple for cheaping out. Others want to blame Europe for silly and onerous rules. As it turns out, neither of those is really true.</p>
<p>Nick’s larger point is that it’s worthwhile—and, more importantly, <em>incumbent upon</em>—those of us who write about these things to take the time to get all the details.</p>
