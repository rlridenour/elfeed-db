<p>Sri Lanka has declared a state of emergency after Cyclone Ditwah brought days of torrential rain that triggered severe flooding and landslides across the island, causing at least 123 deaths and leaving about 130 people unaccounted for, according to the national Disaster Management Centre (DMC) on Saturday. Authorities say nearly half a million residents have been affected, with close to 44,000 people staying in state‑run welfare centers after around 15,000 homes were destroyed or rendered uninhabitable. The government has deployed thousands of army, navy and air force personnel, military helicopters and boats for search, rescue and relief operations, although access to some mountainous and rural areas remains difficult because roads are blocked and communications disrupted by mudslides and damaged fiber‑optic cables. With the cyclone now moving away toward India, Sri Lankan leaders have appealed for international assistance and for cash donations from the Sri Lankan diaspora to support those affected, as relief efforts shift from emergency rescues to restoring basic services and helping families who have lost homes and livelihoods.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/XIDxtyBsZAs1Qt4j93DrDQ92j9ux_OzD2EM90I_hC8zyLgDf_IBsIKuUTGtrLTcI69PX4FRTr2yFNDtgDLxMpJ54G9eVbhZJsUX0vGbl7gs1' alt='Residents wade through deep floodwater on a main road near Colombo after Cyclone Ditwah’s heavy rains.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Communication breakdowns: Officials reported that flooding and landslides snapped fiber‑optic cables and disabled mobile base stations in several regions, prompting deployment of a special unit to restore communications to isolated communities.</li><li>Central highlands damage: Fresh landslides in the central district of Kandy submerged sections of the main access road and cut off some tea‑growing highland areas, complicating efforts to deliver aid by road.</li><li>Scale of displacement: Sri Lanka’s DMC said nearly 44,000 people had taken refuge in temporary shelters and welfare centers after days of rain inundated homes and forced large‑scale evacuations from low‑lying neighborhoods.</li><li>Government emergency powers: The nationwide emergency declaration allows authorities to reallocate resources quickly, restrict movement in high‑risk zones, and coordinate the armed forces and civil agencies under a centralized disaster response command.</li><li>Diaspora and public appeals: The government has asked foreign governments for relief supplies and urged Sri Lankans abroad to make cash contributions to support hundreds of thousands of affected residents as recovery needs mount.</li></ul><blockquote>Relief operations with the help of the armed forces are underway - Sampath Kotuwegoda</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Sri Lankan government: Leaders emphasized that emergency powers and military deployments are intended to speed evacuations, stabilize critical infrastructure, and coordinate aid to communities whose homes and local services were destroyed by the week‑long rains.
