<p>In the latest development in a growing transatlantic dispute, President Donald Trump said he may impose tariffs on countries that do not &quot;go along with&quot; his push for the U.S. to control Greenland, arguing the Arctic territory is needed for U.S. national security. His remarks came as Denmark, Greenland and other NATO partners continued to reject the idea of a U.S. takeover, and as a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers traveled to Copenhagen in an effort to ease tensions. The standoff is putting new strain on alliance politics, even as some officials emphasize continued dialogue—such as a newly announced working group for regular talks between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/tdJ7_pjKAA9BCGcolp088ElVrtbjquB3mrXnzcVX3hrOnyjW319atty4JmO156WwowWBJ6QI8Ad6d9vh3WFZo4qfeHTGYcj7VF_A_RJd1P3G' alt='US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., US, December 11, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Working group talks: The White House said the U.S., Denmark and Greenland agreed to form a working group that would meet every two to three weeks to keep discussions going.</li><li>Lawmakers in Copenhagen: A visiting bipartisan U.S. delegation held meetings with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, alongside Denmark’s foreign and defense ministers and other stakeholders.</li><li>NATO unity concerns: European officials and some U.S. lawmakers quoted by Politico argued that pressuring Denmark over Greenland could weaken NATO cohesion and divert focus and resources from the war in Ukraine.</li><li>Arctic security framing: Trump and aides have cited concerns about Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic and Greenland’s mineral resources as part of the rationale for U.S. control, claims that Russia and China have dismissed in response to similar allegations.</li><li>European support signals: European countries have recently signaled support for Denmark and Greenland, including steps described as troop deployments or reconnaissance tied to NATO-related Arctic activity.</li></ul><blockquote>I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US President Donald Trump: He says the U.S. needs Greenland for national security and has floated tariffs against countries that oppose U.S. control of the island.
