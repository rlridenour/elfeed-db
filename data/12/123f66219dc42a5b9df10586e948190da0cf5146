The European Commission is set to close its year-long investigation into Apple's default browser choice screen on iPhones in the EU after the company made changes to comply with the requirements in the Digital Markets Act (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-set-close-investigation-into-apples-browser-options-sources-say-2025-03-25/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>

The Commission launched a non-compliance investigation in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/eu-to-investigate-apple-dma-compliance/">March last year</a> under the DMA, concerned that Apple's design of the web browser choice screen could be preventing users from properly exercising their choice of alternative default apps to Safari.<br/>
<br/>
With iOS 17.4. Apple made it so that users in the EU who open Safari for the first time are presented with a choice screen that allows them to opt for a new default browser from a list of popular alternatives in their country. However, browser companies have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/apple-eu-default-browser-options-criticized/">openly critical</a> of the way Apple originally designed the screen, and the Commission's probe was conducted in consultation with those companies.<br/>
<br/>
The browser companies encouraged regulators to push for a stronger implementation to level the competitive playing field, and it sounds like they got the improvements they wanted. Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/browser-choice-screen/">made several changes</a> to the screen in question last October with the release of iOS 18.2. <br/>
<br/>
Apple had good reason to abide by its DMA requirements. In cases of infringement, the Commission can impose fines up to 10% of the company's total worldwide turnover. Such fines can go up to 20% in case of repeated infringement under the DMA. The Commission also has the power to adopt "additional remedies" such as "obliging a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it," or banning the company from acquisitions of additional services related to the non-compliance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is still under non-compliance investigation by the Commission for anti-steering rules. The probe is looking at whether the company allows developers to "steer" users away from its App Store and link to alternate payment methods.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/eu-close-antitrust-probe-browser-choice-screen/">EU to Close Antitrust Investigation into Apple&#039;s Browser Choice Screen</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-to-close-antitrust-investigation-into-apples-browser-choice-screen.2454018/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
