<blockquote>
  <p>If you find yourself walking down the street in the 1980s and you
see someone coming who prefers the VIC-20 to the Apple II, cross
to the other side of the street. (That said, the VIC-20 really was
revolutionary. It was by far the most affordable home computer
anyone had ever seen at that point. It was laughably underpowered
… but: it was only $300! They sold a million of ’em.)</p>

<p>Snell takes issue (correctly!) with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/15/saur-c64">Drew Saur’s framing</a> of the Apple II <a href="https://theprogressivecio.com/the-commodore-64-made-a-difference/">as “corporate”</a>. As Snell points out, Commodore was founded by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Tramiel">suit</a> — Apple was founded by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-steve-jobs-met-steve-wozniak-2014-12">two guys</a> whose first collaboration was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/02/the-definitive-story-of-steve-wozniak-steve-jobs-and-phone-phreaking/273331/">making phone-phreaking blue boxes</a>.</p>

<p>But a more pertinent point was made <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@drdrang/114860309297062759">by Dr. Drang on Mastodon</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t want to get on the bad side of @gruber and @jsnell, but
when they say the Commodore 64 cost $600, that’s misleading. Yes,
it cost $600 when it was released, but its price dropped quickly.
By the time I bought one in late ’83 or early ’84, it was selling
for $200 at Kmart. To recognize that it was a great computer for
the price, you have to know what that price really was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/14/commodore-64-ultimate">I wrote the other day</a> that the C64 cost $600, it didn’t jibe with my memory. But my thinking is too set in the ways of Apple, where a computer debuts at a price and then stays at that price. A price around $200 is more what I remember for the C64, at a time when a bare-bones IIe cost $1,400. Inflation-adjusted, $200 in 1984 is about $620 today, and $1,400 is about $4,300. <em>That’s</em> why so many more kids of my era got their parents to spring for a Commodore 64 but not an Apple II. They were rivals in some sense, but really, the Apple II was a different class of computer, and cost nearly an order of magnitude more. Inflation-adjusted, it’s very similar to the difference in both price and capabilities of the Meta Quest versus Vision Pro.</p>

<p>(Me, I didn’t own a computer until I went to college. My parents wouldn’t buy me one because they feared if they did, I’d never leave the house. I resented it at the time, but in hindsight, they might have been right. I didn’t fight too hard because we had an Atari 2600 and a generous budget for game cartridges. Plus, my grade school had a few Apple IIe’s (alongside a bunch of cheap <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-99/4A">TI-99/4A</a>’s), and my middle/high school had an entire lab of Apple IIe’s and IIc’s.)</p>
