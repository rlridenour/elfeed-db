<p>These days, we hear much said on social media — surely too much — in favor of the “hustle culture” and the “grind mindset” (or, abbreviated for maximum efficiency, the “grindset”). Dedication to your work is to be admired, provided that the work itself is of value, but the more of a day’s hours you devote to it, the likelier returns are to diminish. Oliver Burkeman, a popular writer on productivity and time management, has made this point in a variety of ways, usually returning to the same finding: look at the work habits of a range of luminaries including Charles Darwin, <span class="wixui-rich-text__text">Henri Poincaré, </span><span class="wixui-rich-text__text">Thomas Jefferson, Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, J.G. Ballard, Ingmar Bergman, Alice Munro, John le Carré, and Adam Smith, and you’ll find that they all put in about three or four hours of concentrated effort per day.<br>
</span></p>
<p>“You almost certainly can’t consistently do the kind of work that demands serious mental focus for more than about three or four hours a day,” <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourhours">Burkeman writes on his site</a>.&nbsp;If you do work of that kind, it would behoove you to “<span class="wixui-rich-text__text">just focus on protecting four hours — and don’t worry if the rest of the day is characterized by the usual scattered chaos.” </span></p>

<p>Doing so entails making an “i<span class="wixui-rich-text__text">nternal psychological move: to give up demanding more of yourself than three or four hours of daily high-quality mental work.” </span>You’ll also finally have to “<span class="wixui-rich-text__text">abandon the delusion that if you just managed to squeeze in a bit more work, you’d finally reach the commanding status of feeling ‘in control’ and ‘on top of everything’ at last.”</span></p>
<p>The “t<span class="wixui-rich-text__text">he truly valuable skill here,” Burkeman continues, “isn’t the capacity to push yourself harder, but to stop and recuperate despite the discomfort of knowing that work remains unfinished, emails unanswered, other people’s demands unfulfilled.” </span>This is easier said than done, of course, but any attempt to implement what Burkeman calls the “three-to-four-hour rule” must begin with a bit of trial and error: about when best in the day to schedule those hours, but also about how best to eliminate distractions during those hours. Underneath all this lies the need to accept life’s finitude, as Burkeman explains in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm1OfxhmxEY">the interview at the top of the post</a>, with its implication that we can only get so much done in what he often describes as our allotted 4,000 weeks — minus however many thousand we’ve already lived so far.</p>
