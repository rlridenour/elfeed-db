Apple has a new 'Shot on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>' billboard design that combines &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; photography with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sketches, but as one Reddit user noticed, the result is decidedly phallic.<br/>

The billboard was shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/1m5u5ba/whats_the_first_thing_you_see_on_that_add/">the Miami subreddit</a> earlier this month, and highlighted by the <a href="https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/did-apple-put-a-giant-phallic-symbol-on-i-95-23689147">Miami New Times</a> earlier today. The design features a photo of a shark along with a cartoon scuba diver that has an oversized finger because of the perspective, leading the <em>Miami New Times</em> to wonder "Did Apple Put a Giant Phallic Symbol on I-95?"<br/>
<br/>
The billboard is above Miami's I-95 freeway, and it is around 15 feet in length, so it hasn't escaped the notice of motorists. The cartoon is part of Apple's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMQcrCJJa05/">Shot on iPhone, Drawn on iPad series</a> that features creations from eight artists. Up close, the shark, scuba diver, and octopus combo are clear, but it's a little hard to tell what's going on from further away.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's billboard has been up for over a week, plus the design has been shared on Instagram, so Apple may be planning to ignore those who see more than a simple scuba diver in the drawing.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/30/apple-billboard-miami/">Oops: Apple&#039;s Latest Billboard Features Phallic Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oops-apples-latest-billboard-features-phallic-design.2462508/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
