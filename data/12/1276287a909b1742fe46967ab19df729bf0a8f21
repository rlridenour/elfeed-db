  <p>“Just disconnect your TV from the Internet and use an Apple
TV box.”</p>

<p>That’s the common guidance you’ll hear from Ars readers for those
seeking the joys of streaming without giving up too much privacy.
Based on our research and the experts we’ve consulted, that advice
is pretty solid, as Apple TVs offer significantly more privacy
than other streaming hardware providers.</p>

<p>But how private are Apple TV boxes, really? Apple TVs don’t use
automatic content recognition (ACR, a user-tracking technology
leveraged by nearly all smart TVs and streaming devices), but
could that change? And what about the software that Apple TV users
do use — could those apps provide information about you to
advertisers or Apple?</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll delve into what makes the Apple TV’s
privacy stand out and examine whether users should expect the
limited ads and enhanced privacy to last forever.</p>

<p>tvOS is perhaps Apple’s least-talked-about platform. (It surely has orders of magnitude more users than VisionOS, but VisionOS gets talked about because it’s so audacious.) But it might be their platform that’s the furthest ahead of its competition. Not because tvOS is insanely great, but it’s at least pretty good, and every other streaming TV platform seems to be in a race to make real <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqQ6D0Bu-a8">the future TV interface from <em>Idiocracy</em></a>. It’s not just that they’re bad interfaces with deplorable privacy, it’s that they’re outright <em>against</em> the user.</p>
