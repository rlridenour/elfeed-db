<blockquote>
  <p>OpenAI has a new version of the Sora AI video generator that it
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317092/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai-launch">launched at the end of last year</a>, and it’s arriving today
alongside <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sora-by-openai/id6744034028">a new social video app, also called Sora, for
iPhones</a>. The currently invite-only app resembles TikTok with
a feed of videos you can shuffle through. But instead of
encouraging people to stitch together duets, it asks you to record
short videos that anyone can spin into new AI-generated deepfakes — with your consent.</p>

<p>In a briefing with reporters on Monday, employees called it the
potential “ChatGPT moment for video generation.” The Sora app is
currently only available to US and Canada users, with other
countries set to follow, and when someone receives access, they
also get four additional invites to share with friends. There’s no
word on when an Android version might be released.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sora, though invitation-only at the moment, is currently #3 in the U.S. App Store. Meta’s Meta AI app, which contains, in a tab, their Vibes AI-generated video feed, is #97.</p>

<p>Also, I’m sure Sora will eventually come to Android. But, to play with it now, you need an iPhone. So tell me again how Apple is behind on AI? If you have an Android phone, you’re behind on everything except what Google itself offers (which, admittedly, is some great stuff). If you have an iPhone, you’re ahead on everything except what’s baked into iOS. Including the fact that the #1 app on the App Store today is ... Google Gemini.</p>
