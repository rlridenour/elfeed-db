Apple <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/1l854fa/toy_story_and_other_faces_are_removed_in_26/">has removed</a> several Apple Watch faces that are options in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>, nixing the Fire/Water, Gradient, Liquid Metal, Vapor, and Toy Story watch faces, according to a post on Reddit.<br/>

Apple tends to quietly remove some watch face options when it launches a new version of iOS, so it is not a huge surprise to see these go missing. It is not clear why Apple picked these watch faces in particular, but it could be because they were used less often.<br/>

Apple didn't add new watch faces with watchOS 26, but some watch faces have new Liquid Glass-inspired design options.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/watchos-26-removes-these-apple-watch-faces/">watchOS 26 Removes These Apple Watch Faces</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-26-removes-these-apple-watch-faces.2458677/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
