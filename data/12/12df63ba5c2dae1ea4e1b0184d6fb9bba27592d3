<p><a href="https://codelearn.me/2022/06/04/emacs-config-from-scratch.html">Almost a year ago</a> I already tried to start using Doom config which
I eventually replaced with my own vanilla config.</p>
<p>Today I decided to try it once again. I also wanted to use it in Evil mode
to make my hands feel better.</p>
<p>One of my main pain point with someone else&rsquo;s config is that I don&rsquo;t know how to handle it,
what options are available and why things work in the way they do.</p>
<p>Since I was on my own config for quite some time I believe I know enough about
Emacs configuration to attempt Doom config once again.</p>
<h2 id="first-impression">First impression</h2>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not first. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken it&rsquo;s my third or fourth attempt to use Doom.</p>
<p>So far it feels ok. I ported some configuration from my vanilla config. Added packages I need and things seems working smoothly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see that Doom preferably switched to <code>project</code> mode instead of <code>projectile</code> at least this is what I see
based on keybindings that are set for <code>project</code> mode and no keybindings at all for <code>projectile</code>.</p>
<p>My custom org agendas and some other custom functions were ported with just simple copy-paste technique.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-like">What I like</h2>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s really great to see the <code>M-x doom/help</code> exists. Everything is documented or at least most of the things.</li>
<li>There is also <code>M-x doom/help-search</code> which is very useful when you need to find a specific help.
<ul>
<li>The documentation can be improved probably. There is no info about how to change <code>evil escape sequence</code> to something different from default. At least the <code>doom/help-search</code> mentions the <code>evil-escape</code> package which user then can google and find how to change that escape sequence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I love doom modules. Community has already spent good amount of time tweaking every module and in most of the cases I don&rsquo;t need to do much to reconfigure it.</li>
<li>LSP module is nice and works with Eglot. What&rsquo;s great is that other modules (like PHP for example) already aware that LSP module can use Eglot and when I open a php file my Eglot just starts and works.</li>
<li>Evil mode and all keybindings that already configured are incredible.</li>
<li>General look and feel is way better than I could achieve with my vanilla config.</li>
<li>Org looks great and evil keybindings are very nice configured.</li>
<li>I like the way configuration works and some useful macros provided by Doom</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-need-to-understandchange">What I need to understand/change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Documentation is sometimes lacking. That&rsquo;s hopefully something I can help with.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t like that LSP/Eglot starts automatically. I do believe &ldquo;start automatically by default&rdquo; is a good choice though.</li>
<li>There are no projectile keybindings and there is no my favorite <code>projectile-run-vterm</code>. Easy fix though.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t really understand a point of <code>+vterm/toggle</code>. It works great in one project but when I open a second one then this function still opens up the vterm that belongs to that first project.</li>
<li><code>doom/reload-theme</code> - probably doesn&rsquo;t work on my end. When I set <code>doom-theme</code> variable to something else/non-default and then call <code>M-x doom/reload-theme</code> nothing changes. I have to use <code>M-x consult-theme</code> to actually change a theme.</li>
<li>I still need to figure out how to use <code>after!</code>. I initially thought that this macro&rsquo;s first argument is something that is mentioned in <code>init.el -&gt; doom!</code> call but apparently I should specify an emacs package name there.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In general, I love the feeling. It took me almost no time to get used to vim keybindings and keep coding like nothing&rsquo;s changed.
Probably my vim past is already too deep in my muscle memory. I&rsquo;m glad my emacs past is also quite deep so I feel like I can seamlessly
switch from one way of editing to another.</p>
