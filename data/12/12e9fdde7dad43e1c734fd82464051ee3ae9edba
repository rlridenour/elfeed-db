I use exwm so M-TAB is available to me without being hijacked by the OS, but rebinding this failed in surprising places. I want it globally to be set to iflipb-next-buffer (giving familiar alt+tab functionality to exwm), but if any of the buffers I&rsquo;m travelling past happen to inherit magit or gnus, my tab-sequence gets broken because they have it bound to their own thing and I can&rsquo;t seem to rebind it.
