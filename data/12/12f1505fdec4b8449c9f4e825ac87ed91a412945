<p>Vim&rsquo;s <strong>autocmd</strong> is very powerful feature.</p>
<p>In my workflow I have many of them including <strong>autocmd</strong> for <strong>BufWrite</strong>.</p>
<p>There are rare cases when I want to save file and ignore any <strong>autocmd</strong>.</p>
<p>To do this you can just save it by:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>:noa w
</code></pre><p>Of course there can be any command after <code>:noa</code>.</p>
<p>Check <code>:h noa</code> for more details.</p>
