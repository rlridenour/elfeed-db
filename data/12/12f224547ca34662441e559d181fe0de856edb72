<li>A heaping helping of portable charging power</li>
<li>Built-in USB-C and Lightning cables</li>
<li>Also a USB-A and USB-C port</li>
<li>Is it available in Georgia Red: That’s what stickers are for, friend</li>
</ul><h1>Power Up</h1><p>“Alright,” said Anne. “That’s twelve points for Mark and me. Now, it’s your turn, Jeff and Mick.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to list or count?” Jeff said.</p>
<p>“I’ll list,” Mick said.</p>
<p>“Okay, cool,” Jeff said. And he drew a card.</p>
<p>“Your minute starts… now!” Mark said, flipping the hourglass.</p>
<p>“Okay Mick,” Jeff said. “You have one minute to… list as many things as you can think of that can be charged with a JOYFAR 30,000mAh Portable PowerBank.”</p>
<p>“Weird that they give a specific brand,” Anne said.</p>
<p>“I think I read that the game makers had to explore corporate sponsorships when their crowdsourcing campaign didn’t succeed,” Mark said.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay,” Mick said. “Phone.”</p>
<p>“One,” said Jeff.</p>
<p>“Tablet.”</p>
<p>“Two.”</p>
<p>“Bike light.”</p>
<p>“Three.”</p>
<p>“Earbuds.”</p>
<p>“Four.”</p>
<p>“Light bike,” Mick said.</p>
<p>“No, we already did bike light,” Jeff said.</p>
<p>“Not a bike light,” Mick said. “A light bike. A bike of light.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” Jeff said.</p>
<p>“Instead of having a frame, it uses LED technology,” Mick said.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t make any sense,” Jeff said. “How do you sit on it?”</p>
<p>“It uses LED technology,” Mick repeated. “Didn’t I just say that?”</p>
<p>“But that doesn’t explain–”</p>
<p>“And that’s time,” Mark said.</p>
<p>“Is that four points for you two then?” Anne said.</p>
<p>Mick stomped his feet. “Five! The fifth one was the light bike!”</p>
<p>“But, is that even a real thing?” Mark said.</p>
<p>“You know what, forget it.” Mick got to his feet and grabbed his helmet from next to the door. “This game night sucks. I’m going home.”</p>
<p>Through the window, they all watched him ride away on something that looked like an orb of light.</p>
