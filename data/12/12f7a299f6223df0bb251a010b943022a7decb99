<p>Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven met in Canada and presented a united front backing Ukraine while steering clear of some contentious topics such as trade disputes and recent U.S. military strikes. In a joint statement they said they would increase economic pressure on Moscow and are exploring measures aimed at those who finance Russia’s war effort. Ukraine’s foreign minister pressed allies for help as Russia steps up strikes on the country’s energy grid, seeking protection ahead of winter and a potential surge in outages. The ministers also strongly condemned the escalation of violence in Sudan and voiced concern about the humanitarian situation there.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/2mRb8cnS-ophwC18RpKnTYuCBag1MXES9FYD5XthJT-VcYdosXLyp-7njmAd_NiP3z07HYsAozE5VHs29IMyVxylXGPrUvFtvslhhJMT7NR_3cOAT7MC-6O9c1Kw4ZIx2ugPTH91jCz01GYdX6r_GnA9kgncb2pdJ8OaiSAwaC7hcFT6LKX5axM_LBdNGAiAMTwJeIQ2wTKyu9O-cTrVwGtz8HW89hmtyFilLiLpR0kKJXslTlOLa0s' alt='G7 foreign ministers at talks in Canada' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Energy plea: Ukraine’s foreign minister asked the G7 for urgent help as Russian strikes increasingly target the power grid, a trend that officials warned could worsen before winter</li><li>New sanctions: Canada announced additional sanctions against Russia at the talks, while the UK pledged €14 million to shore up Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, signaling concrete short-term support measures</li><li>Topics avoided: Ministers intentionally sidestepped thorny issues — including trade tensions and recent U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean — to preserve consensus on Ukraine and Sudan</li><li>U.S. assessment: U.S. officials attending the meetings have concluded Moscow shows little seriousness about negotiating an end to the war, complicating diplomatic options for the G7</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine (foreign minister Andriy Sybiha): He pressed G7 allies for support as Russia targets Ukraine’s energy grid ahead of winter, urging more protection for critical infrastructure.
