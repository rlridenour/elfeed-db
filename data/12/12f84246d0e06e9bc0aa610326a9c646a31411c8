Apple is aiming to debut its delayed personalized <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> features in the spring of 2026, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-12/apple-targets-spring-2026-for-release-of-delayed-siri-ai-upgrade">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. Gurman claims that Apple set an "internal release target" of 2026, which is in line with comments from Apple executives this week.<br/>

Craig Federighi and Greg Joswiak <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-says-personalized-siri-was-working/">did multiple post-WWDC interviews</a> acknowledging Apple's issues with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, and confirmed that Apple is now planning for a 2026 release. According to Apple's narrative, there were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-explains-personalized-siri-delay/">ongoing quality issues</a> with its testing of the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features, so it held them back and swapped to a more powerful underlying architecture to address the problems.<br/>
<br/>
Apple initially planned to launch the personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features in iOS 18.4, so after the year-long delay to fix the architecture, we could see the functionality introduced in an iOS 26.4 update sometime in March or April 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman claims that if the next few weeks of development "proves promising," Apple could preview the features when it launches the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models in the fall. It is unclear if Apple will do so, because it faced significant criticism and multiple class-action lawsuits for delaying the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first showed off the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; updates at WWDC 2024 last June, and advertised the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models using demonstrations of the functionality. Customers who bought an &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; in anticipation of the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features were not happy with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">news of Apple's delay</a> this March.<br/>
<br/>
For <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a>, Apple did not highlight any features that are coming in the future, and almost everything that the company introduced during the keynote event is present in the first developer beta.<br/>

The &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that we are waiting on include personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper integration with apps. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/">Apple Plans to Release Delayed Siri Apple Intelligence Features in Spring 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-plans-to-release-delayed-siri-apple-intelligence-features-in-spring-2026.2458895/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
