<p>A record-breaking heatwave across south-east Australia has pushed temperatures toward 50°C (122°F) and escalated bushfire danger, particularly in Victoria, South Australia and parts of New South Wales. Fire authorities issued evacuation orders and warned of “emergency level” fire conditions as multiple major blazes burned in Victoria. Several towns reported new or near-record highs, but multiple reports said there were no casualties reported from Tuesday’s heatwave as of publication. Forecasts and officials indicated some coastal relief from cooler conditions, while inland areas were expected to keep sweltering for days.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/dfq0p8V8MnXmR15O5Wvci5yX4qnPWPel4O3wb3kJ59GfMJ-iBIGTQ7LhipNEamRlAwHs_4pczmvK4D5CP1AiCapJd2jZFh1Z8FJWakYl8yaSe5aYAsAw7oycOOSJV4P9eWt0ialrz1kaLgQ2t4B-pI9qhsQX0lRVonEXLREAreZAwkKQw2J9GVUZsMuNEQmNIRNmaBQByBfYauYVqGgypraNy5pka4rY7WomUY5xnN3ss7fBCad6bHCItWBZAYkJ-wS4xWSfUEXG5HfNrg' alt='Fans walk and ride bikes through a water mister at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Jan. 27, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Record readings: Renmark in South Australia recorded 49.6°C on Tuesday, while Walpeup in Victoria reached 48.9°C, according to reporting and meteorological commentary cited by AAP.</li><li>Fire comparisons: If Victoria’s preliminary 48.9°C reading is confirmed, it would edge past the state record set on the day of the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, when 173 people died.</li><li>Health warnings: Victoria’s Chief Health Officer warned severe heatwave conditions can trigger dangerous illnesses such as heat exhaustion, with heightened risk for older people, babies, young children and pregnant women.</li><li>Melbourne forecast: Melbourne was forecast to reach about 45°C on Tuesday, its hottest day in nearly 17 years, adding strain to emergency services and public heat-safety planning.</li><li>Extended danger: Emergency officials said Victoria’s north could face several more days above 40°C with warm overnight temperatures, keeping fire danger elevated even as some areas cool.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Fire authorities (Victoria): They warned of “emergency level” fire conditions and urged residents in affected areas to act quickly on evacuation and safety advice as multiple large fires burned.
