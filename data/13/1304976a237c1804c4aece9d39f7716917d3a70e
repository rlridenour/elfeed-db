If you <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-26-developer-beta-iphone/">installed iOS 26 Beta or iPadOS 26 Beta</a> through Apple's Developer Program or Software Beta Program, you may decide you want to downgrade because of usability or stability issues. Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>

Apple's beta versions of its major software updates can be notoriously buggy, especially the early releases. You may find apps not working properly, poor battery life, device crashes, and features that don't do what they're supposed to. Fortunately, you can restore your iPhone or iPad to the previous version of iOS.<br/>
<br/>
If you made an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-26-developer-beta-iphone/#backup">archived backup</a> before you installed the iOS 26 beta, you can remove the ‌beta and restore the backup. If you didn't make a backup, you can still downgrade, but you won't be able to restore your device to its original state before you upgraded.<br/>
<br/>
Also, bear in mind that if you've installed watchOS 26 on your Apple Watch, you won't be able to use it with your ‌iPhone‌ once you've gone back to iOS 18. And downgrading an Apple Watch to a previous version of watchOS can't be done manually either – if you want to remove ‌watchOS 26, you'll have to send your watch in to Apple.<br/>
