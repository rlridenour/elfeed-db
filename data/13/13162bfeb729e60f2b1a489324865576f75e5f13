<p>My thanks to <a href="http://makeitsparkle.co/?utm_source=sixcolors">Sparkle</a> for sponsoring Six Colors this week.</p>
<p>Sparkle is a utility that uses AI power to organize your files and clean up your Mac. Most of us try to be good, but with all the work we’ve got to do, it’s hard to find the time to throw out those old files and clean up your folders.</p>
<p>Drop a file on your Desktop? Sparkle quietly organizes it. Download something for a project? Sparkle knows where it should go. Sparkle automatically sorts your files into three intelligent categories: Recents, AI Library (older files organized in a smart folder structure based on the files themselves), and Manual Library (for stuff you don’t want Sparkle to touch).</p>
<p>Sparkle looks at your filenames and creates a folder structure that makes sense. Tax documents go with tax documents. Project files cluster together. Screenshots find their proper home.</p>
<p>Here’s how Sparkle handles privacy: it never sends the contents of your files off your device, only the filenames. Filenames are temporarily stored for performance optimization and deleted after 30 days.</p>
<p>Sparkle solves a real problem without requiring behavioral change. It’s not going to suddenly make you an organized person, but your Mac can be organized anyway.</p>
<p>You can try Sparkle for 14 days for free on their monthly and yearly plans. For Six Colors readers, visit <a href="http://makeitsparkle.co/?utm_source=sixcolors">makeitsparkle.co</a> and use code SIXCOLORS for 20% off the lifetime plan. Because life’s too short to spend it cleaning up your Downloads folder.</p>
