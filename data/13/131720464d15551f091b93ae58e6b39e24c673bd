<p>As part of the transition, a new <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11097/editorial-board">editorial board</a> has been established. <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/anna.bortolan/">Anna Bortolan</a> (Swansea University) and <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/marta-jorba">Marta Jorba</a> (Pompeu Fabra University) have been appointed as associate editors, joining <a href="https://www.juliankiverstein.com/">Julian Kiverstein</a> (Amsterdam University Medical Center) and <a href="https://www.joelkrueger.com/">Joel Krueger</a> (University of Exeter) who continue serving as associate editors, and <a href="https://scholars.uow.edu.au/glenda-satne">Glenda Satne</a> (University of Wollongong) who continues as book review editor. There is a new editorial committee, expanding representation across gender, geographic location, career stage, and discipline. And a small advisory board of senior academics has been established, including Gallagher and Zahavi.</p>
<p>The new editors say:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The journal will continue publishing work at the intersection of phenomenology and the cognitive sciences, construed broadly to include work in disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience. We intend to strengthen the journal’s original aim of bridging analytic philosophy of mind and phenomenology. And we plan to expand the journal’s scope, increasing submissions from the social sciences, including anthropology, sociology, and archaeology, among other disciplines. To build capacity in these areas, over the next few years we will commission a series of special issues on topics at the intersection of phenomenology and analytic philosophy of mind, as well as phenomenology and the social sciences.</em></p>
