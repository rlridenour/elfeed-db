A prayer for those searching for the perfect church:
</p>

 <p>
Lord Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
We move from <br></br>
church to church, <br></br>
searching for one <br></br>
that meets our needs, <br></br>
one that is perfect <br></br>
for people like us. <br></br> <br></br>
But what do we hope to find? <br></br>
A church filled <br></br>
with perfect people? <br></br>
People who have no faults, <br></br>
who speak no unkind words, <br></br>
who never hurt one another, <br></br>
and never have regrets? <br></br> <br></br>
A perfect church, indeed, <br></br>
but a church with no place <br></br>
for one like me, <br></br>
a broken spirit <br></br>
who needs <br></br>
grace, <br></br>
love, <br></br>
healing, <br></br>
and mercy. <br></br> <br></br>
And so, I bow in prayer, <br></br>
to ask for a church <br></br>
filled with those <br></br>
who are broken and flawed, <br></br>
hurting and in sorrow, <br></br>
who are there because <br></br>
they know that together, <br></br>
with you, <br></br>
they can find <br></br>
grace and mercy, <br></br>
healing, and hope <br></br>
in that place <br></br>
they call their church. <br></br> <br></br>
Then I open my eyes <br></br>
to find that my prayer <br></br>
has already been answered. <br></br> <br></br>
Thank you, Lord, <br></br>
for leading me home. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
