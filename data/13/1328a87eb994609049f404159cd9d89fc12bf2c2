Apple is set to reorganize its health and fitness divisions under its Services group, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-10/apple-to-move-health-fitness-divisions-to-services-in-reorganization">Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The move comes as longtime chief operating officer Jeff Williams prepares to depart at the end of this year.<br/>

Services chief Eddy Cue will reportedly gain oversight of Apple's health and fitness teams, with the groups being consolidated under health lead Sumbul Desai. Meanwhile, Fitness+ head Jay Blahnik will report to Desai in the new structure. Both teams had previously reported to Williams.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman suggests the reorganization is being timed with Apple's plans to launch a new Health+ subscription service, which he first reported on in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/30/ios-19-4-revamped-health-app-rumor/">March</a>. The offering is said to feature an AI assistant providing personalized recommendations on nutrition, exercise, and sleep. Apple plans to launch the new service next year.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Gurman reports that Craig Federighi will add watchOS to his software oversight, while hardware chief John Ternus – tipped to eventually <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/06/apple-leadership-shakeup-impending/">succeed Tim Cook</a> in the CEO role – will assume sole control of Apple Watch hardware engineering.<br/>
<br/>
Cue already manages Apple's streaming services, iCloud, Maps, and other digital offerings, and placing health and fitness under his Services umbrella suggests Apple wants to transform its wellness initiatives into a more significant revenue stream. <br/>

Williams has been transferring his responsibilities since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/jeff-williams-stepping-down-as-apple-coo/">announcing his retirement in July</a>, with supply chain and operations duties moving to new operating chief Sabih Khan.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health/">Health</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/10/apple-health-fitness-teams-eddy-cue-reshuffle/">Apple&#039;s Health and Fitness Teams Report to Eddy Cue in Reshuffle</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-health-and-fitness-teams-report-to-eddy-cue-in-reshuffle.2468837/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
