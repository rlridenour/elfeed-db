In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-08/apple-s-liquid-glass-ios-26-software-redesign-to-hint-at-20th-anniversary-iphone-mbnm2u0d"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman said that the 20th-anniversary iPhone will feature curved glass edges, extraordinarily slim bezels, and a truly edge-to-edge screen with no cutout. Inside Apple, he said that the device is known as the "Glasswing," in reference to a type of butterfly that has transparent wings.<br/>

The new iOS design will pair nicely with the simplistic, all-glass 20th-anniversary iPhone, which is expected to launch in September 2027.<br/>
