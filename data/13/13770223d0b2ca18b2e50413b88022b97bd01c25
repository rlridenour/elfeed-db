<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="https://d12frosted.io/">Boris Buliga</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus">Emacs Plus</a> <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> recipe for customizing and installing Emacs builds on macOS.</p>
<p>For a little while, I took a detour and built Emacs myself, so I could enable <a href="https://twitter.com/Koral_001">Andrea Corallo</a>'s fantastic <a href="http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html">native compilation</a>. I documented the steps <a href="https://xenodium.com/trying-out-gccemacs-on-macos/">here</a>. Though it was fairly straightforward, I did miss Emacs Plus's convenience.</p>
<p>I had been meaning to check back on Emacs Plus for native compilation support. Turns out, it was merged back in <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/pull/188">Dec 2020</a>, and it works great!</p>
<p>Enabling native compilation is simple (just use <em>–with-native-comp</em>). As a bonus, you get all the Emacs Plus goodies. I'm loving <em>–with-elrumo2-icon</em>, enabling a spiffy icon to go with macOS Big Sur. <em>–with-no-frame-refocus</em> is also handy to <a href="https://xenodium.com/no-emacs-frame-refocus-on-macos/">avoid refocusing other frames</a> when another one is closed.</p>
<p>In any case, here's the minimum needed to install Emacs Plus with native compilation support enabled:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus@28 --with-native-comp
</code></pre>
<p>Sit tight. Homebrew will build and install some chunky dependencies (including gcc and libgccjit).</p>
<p>Note: Your init.el needs tweaking to take advantage of native compilation. See my <a href="https://xenodium.com/trying-out-gccemacs-on-macos/">previous post</a> for how I set mine, or go straight to <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/features/fe-package-extensions.el#L19">my config</a>.</p>
