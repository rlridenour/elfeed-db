<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/555">This week on Upgrade</a>, my guest John Siracusa and I pondered whether <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-16/apple-iphone-17-air-foldable-iphone-details-ai-crisis-to-haunt-top-100-event-m8bl3a9c">Mark Gurman’s report</a> that the forthcoming iPhone Air wouldn’t be as big as an iPhone Pro Max because of a fear of a return to the days of “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/24/17389220/apple-bendgate-internal-documents-iphone-6-plus">bendgate</a>.”</p>

John thought that an unlikely reason, which led to my homework.
