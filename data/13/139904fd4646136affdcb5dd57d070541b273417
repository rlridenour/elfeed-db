<p>The European Union and the Mercosur bloc are set to sign a long-negotiated free trade agreement on Saturday in Asunción, creating a trade area spanning more than 700 million people and roughly 30% of global GDP. Supporters present the deal as a fresh push for rules-based, multilateral trade at a time when President Trump’s tariff moves have encouraged many governments to seek new partnerships. After the signing, the pact enters a lengthy ratification phase in Europe, where it faces political scrutiny in several countries.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7qV9EEielRbI3KaK5kJBiESKHO1RGSPfvpKTKjYvxWufiGJFAsb1ueyemGBCVQouYkuewMJIRd8D56VU4zXQTXxw7iz21WcPylH6YsFYpKJ0VR_LqDawGuViiRRrrLx9OZCJCIdzhDQ564B-Ucf3vLMWumbxUL4EdPumwSp4xKLI3uOtsSee2yoI3us4K2QVKk1nBOMLkSnSFu7Dw76yZWAgyFKJz_BNqW-g5-PIQmaxgRsqCSZ5aY5CrMYYAv0' alt='French farmers protest the European Union-Mercosur free trade agreement in Paris on January 8, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Gradual rollout: Implementation is designed to be phased in over time and includes safeguards, with Le Monde noting the overall economic impact is expected to be limited and very gradual.</li><li>Farm pressures: Agriculture remains a central flashpoint in Europe, with farmer protests highlighting fears of increased competition and standards disputes around food imports.</li><li>Raw materials: DW reports EU officials and analysts see the pact as a way to improve access to critical raw materials as Europe’s share of global markets slips.</li><li>Lula absent: Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will not attend the signing ceremony in Paraguay, even as Brazil remains a key player in the agreement’s next stages.</li><li>Democracy framing: Lula and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen publicly linked the agreement to strengthening democracy and multilateralism in global trade governance.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Commission (von der Leyen): Von der Leyen and allies frame the agreement as a pro-multilateral, pro-democracy step that strengthens rules-based global trade ties between regions.
