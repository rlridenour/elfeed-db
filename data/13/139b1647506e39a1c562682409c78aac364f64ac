Apple has stopped signing iOS 18.6.2, which means that if you've upgraded to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, you're no longer able to downgrade to a version of iOS 18. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/15/apple-releases-ios-26/">released iOS 26</a> a week ago.<br/>

When software is "signed," it means that it has passed a server-side verification check that Apple performs when a new version of iOS is downloaded on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. An update can't be installed unless it passes the verification check.<br/>
<br/>
Unsigning software prevents Apple customers from installing outdated, less secure versions of iOS.<br/>
<br/>
Apple isn't forcing users to install &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, and there is an option to continue using iOS 18, but once a device has been upgraded to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, there's no going back.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also stopped signing iPadOS 18.6.2 and tvOS 18.6, so there's also no downgrade option available for iPads.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2/">Apple Stops Signing iOS 18.6.2, iOS 26 Downgrades Now Impossible</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-6-2-ios-26-downgrades-now-impossible.2467148/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
