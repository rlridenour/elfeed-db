<p>I quickly got used to <a href="http://xenodium.com/emacs-org-block-company-completion/">Emacs org block company completion</a>. I did, however, almost always found myself running <em>org-edit-special</em> immediately after inserting completion. I use <strong>C-c '</strong> for that. That's all fine, but it just felt redundant.</p>
<p>Why not automatically edit the source block in corresponding major mode after completion? I think I can also get used to that!</p>

<p>Or maybe the automatic approach is too eager? There's also a middle ground: ask immediately after.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-edit-after-org-block-completion/prompted.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Or maybe I don't want either in the end? Time will tell, but I now have all three options available:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(defcustom company-org-block-edit-mode 'auto
  &quot;Customize whether edit mode, post completion was inserted.&quot;
  :type '(choice
          (const :tag &quot;nil: no edit after insertion&quot; nil)
          (const :tag &quot;prompt: ask before edit&quot; prompt)
          (const :tag &quot;auto edit, no prompt&quot; auto)))
</code></pre>
<p>The new option is now in the <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/company-org-block.el">company-org-block snippet</a> with my latest config.</p>
