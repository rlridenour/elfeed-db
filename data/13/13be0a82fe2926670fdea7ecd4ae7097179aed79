<p id="p2">One of the most beloved indie weather apps just got a massive overhaul, and it&rsquo;s worth checking out as your new daily driver. The whole app has been modernized and rebuilt from the ground up, and it feels great.</p>
<p id="p3"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hello-weather/id978393692" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Weather</a> has always been known for its simple, friendly, super readable design, but the new update pairs that simplicity with more depth, sophistication, and powerful new features.</p>
<p id="p4">There are beautiful new summaries and visualizations for over a dozen data points like Wind, Air Quality, UV Index, and Moon phases. That&rsquo;s along with extended hourly forecasts, excellent forecasts for the week ahead, and tons of little options to tune the app&rsquo;s icons, themes, and layouts however you like them.</p>
<p id="p5">The new update addresses some longstanding feature gaps, too: Hello Weather now has push notifications, a revamped radar, and an excellent refreshed Apple Watch app and complications.</p>
<p id="p6">It also supports a dozen different data providers. You can switch from Apple Weather&rsquo;s forecasts to ultra-detailed info from AccuWeather, Foreca, The Weather Company, and lots more. Stick with the source that&rsquo;s best for your area, or swap between them to compare forecasts.</p>
<p id="p7">Hello Weather respects your privacy, with one of the best data collection policies in the category. The app doesn&rsquo;t track any user-identifiable data, sell ads, or anything like that. It&rsquo;s a customer-focused app, thoughtfully designed, and made with care.</p>
