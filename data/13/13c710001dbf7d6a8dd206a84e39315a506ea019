<p>SpaceX launched its eleventh Starship test flight from Starbase, Texas on Monday evening, with liftoff around 7:20 p.m. ET [reuters.com#2][dw.com#4][scmp.com#5]. The Super Heavy booster executed a soft water landing in the Gulf of Mexico roughly 10 minutes after launch, while the mission aimed to send Starship toward the Indian Ocean and test experimental heat-shield tiles during reentry [reuters.com#2][scmp.com#5]. SpaceX also targeted the deployment of a second batch of dummy Starlink satellites as part of proving out the vehicle’s reusable design for future satellite lofting and human missions [reuters.com#2][scmp.com#5]. The company says this flight sets up the debut of an upgraded prototype tailored for lunar and Mars objectives, with the system described as central to NASA’s Moon plans [dw.com#4][straitstimes.com#1][reuters.com#2][france24.com#6]. An August mission had marked a turning point by ending a streak of test failures earlier this year [reuters.com#2].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SK9W91BusOCUO1S6hl8V3vscQOsh442fIwhx3tvIVzKKoJu4QoktdymIN1GmQnoOgAnPiFAEkqLqsRj_Jf5HQ3Z70FNtW90m49HDs7ahQhHWzr4NxqtnZ-8lUjpi2V3ENHY8ekbbhP8PQr3PUw7ncip4inhPPaoF4Rq7GhLFtxsfEHiNACZA33VKu_Ry5mItK0WkIR_hjaSzQEcvRX1MXGPPPjdyUkDYJoaPe7Dbm6-EJno1YaI' alt='Starship lifts off from Starbase, Texas during its 11th test flight.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Reusability focus: The two-stage vehicle tested reusable operations, including a Super Heavy splashdown and a Starship reentry profile toward the Indian Ocean [reuters.com#2][scmp.com#5].</li><li>Onboard experiments: SpaceX aimed to deploy a second cluster of dummy Starlink satellites and evaluate experimental heat-shield tiles during the fiery return [reuters.com#2][scmp.com#5].</li><li>Next iteration: After this flight, SpaceX plans to begin testing an upgraded Starship prototype with features tailored for Moon and Mars missions [reuters.com#2][dw.com#4][straitstimes.com#1].</li><li>NASA context: The fully reusable Starship system is described as central to NASA’s lunar plans, underscoring the program’s broader significance [france24.com#6].</li></ul><blockquote>But, you know, you never know when you&#x27;re going to get punched in the face, so we&#x27;ll see. - Gwynne Shotwell</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>SpaceX leadership: Leaders emphasize careful preparation for Flight 11 while acknowledging test risks and the aim to move to an upgraded prototype next.
