On iPhone and iPad, Live Photos bring your pictures to life by adding a few seconds of video before and after the shot, creating a living memory rather than a static image. <br/>
<br/>
While Live Photos are great on their own, it's also possible to weave several together to create a video montage. This process transforms a collection of moments into a cohesive narrative, and offers an easier way to share and relive your memories. <br/>
<br/>
Whether it's a series of shots from a special event, a day out with friends, or a compilation of everyday moments, the following steps show you how to turn several Live Photos into a video that can encapsulate their essence in a way that a single photo or traditional video might not.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>In the Photos app, tap the <strong>Collections</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</li><br/>
  <li>Scroll down to "Media Types," and tap <strong>Live Photos</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Select</strong> in the top-right corner, then tap the Live Photos you want to include in your video so that a little checkmark appears on each one.<br/>

  <li>Tap the button with three dots in the top-right corner.</li><br/>
  <li>Choose <strong>Save as Video</strong> in the pop-up menu.<br/>

</ol>That's all there is to it. To watch your newly created video, return to the Library view or find it in the Videos category under Media Types. <br/>
<br/>
Note that the video will be dated to when the Live Photos were originally taken, so unless you have the <strong>Sort by Recently Added</strong> option checked, they may not show as the latest video in your collection.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/turn-several-live-photos-into-video-iphone/">Turn Several Live Photos into a Single Video on iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/turn-several-live-photos-into-a-single-video-on-iphone.2476497/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
