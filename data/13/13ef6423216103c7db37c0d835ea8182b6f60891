<p>In the latest development in rising US-Iran tensions, President Trump said he believes Iran wants to make a deal to avoid US military action, while emphasizing that the United States has dispatched a large naval force toward the region. Iran, for its part, signaled openness to “fair” talks but rejected negotiating its missile and defense capabilities, and warned it will not talk “under the shadow of threats”. The standoff sits alongside broader regional concern that any strike could trigger instability and economic disruption, which has fueled diplomatic activity by Middle Eastern partners and others urging restraint and de-escalation. A hopeful note: multiple parties publicly keep diplomacy on the table, and regional mediation efforts have intensified as leaders seek off-ramps that avoid a wider conflict.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7ARNANNmuMV5zBNwckAgliJpVgVCfWEv5yz9rpS0y1Pe-UpProAxLTVc3uMTllM1FHTO0IBgA8y9DqvdmWMPojtJHNO-9WyJfEl7wvCJLK3SWgnDdRy9MeGU7NroGIFRFDffUK--Tv8-rDyv1Kmvfv9xCDvLZQHjWWwP-Ptca8dNFE8vPywM4702LxT7W038Al1M-SFchxQMO-KCVAlHsGLoEPZFJkZrNvZWj9OSSKePZE0iFv3SuEmnYhyy-rq_Rb3toZDDhMF-HM4yMw' alt='Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan (right) and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi hold a joint press conference in Istanbul, Jan. 30, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Deadline ambiguity: Asked about a deadline for an agreement covering Iran’s nuclear program, missiles and other issues, President Trump said he had given one but added that “only they know for sure” what it is.</li><li>Hormuz warning: CENTCOM issued a formal warning urging Iran’s IRGC Navy to conduct planned two-day live-fire drills in the Strait of Hormuz “in a manner that is safe” and said it would not tolerate specific “unsafe” behaviors near US forces.</li><li>Gulf constraints: Saudi Arabia and the UAE publicly said they will not allow their airspace or territory to be used for an attack on Iran, as Gulf states step up diplomacy to avert escalation.</li><li>Mediation push: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian that Türkiye is ready to facilitate between Tehran and Washington, and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called restarting nuclear talks “vital” to reduce tensions.</li><li>Moscow meeting: Russian President Vladimir Putin met Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, in an unannounced Kremlin meeting amid the heightened US-Iran standoff.</li></ul><blockquote>Hopefully we’ll make a deal.
