 <p>
Having some time this summer, I decided to try to convert my very disorganized Emacs config files into one Org-mode file. I have had a literate config in the past, and it went much more easily than I remember. If you’re thinking about creating one, here is what I recommend.
</p>

 <p>
First, use the same org file to generate both  <code>early-init.el</code> and  <code>init.el</code>. The file that a section tangles to is specified in the section’s properties. My first top-level section heading is this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-org"> <span class="org-org-level-1">* Early init file</span>
 <span class="org-org-drawer">:PROPERTIES:</span>
 <span class="org-org-special-keyword">:header-args:</span>  <span class="org-org-property-value">:tangle early-init.el</span>
 <span class="org-org-drawer">:END:</span>
</pre>
</div>

 <p>
Anything in this section becomes part of  <code>early-init.el</code>. All of the other top-level sections specify to tangle to  <code>init.el</code>. Both files are created when the Org file is tangled. Lower-level sections inherit their properties from the top-levels. So, only the top-level sections need the properties specified.
</p>

 <p>
I recommend beginning by adding just enough to set up package management and installing  <a href="https://github.com/yilkalargaw/org-auto-tangle">Org Auto Tangle</a>, and then use  <code>C-c C-v t</code> to tangle the file and generate both  <code>early-init.el</code> and  <code>init.el</code>. After that, Org Auto Tangle will automatically tangle the file every time that the Org file is saved.
