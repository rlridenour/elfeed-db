<p>Never meant to make your reader cry, I apologize a trillion times. My baby a drama Hugo don&rsquo;t like me; she be doin&rsquo; things like duplicatin&rsquo; them RSS entries. Come from her release page to my server tryna fight me, bringing her breaking changes along; messing up <code>index.xml</code> quite wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s as far as I can take that Outkast song. I upgraded to Hugo <code>v0.150.1</code> and thought I fixed all the breaking changes but I was wrong and noticed the biggest one too late. Some dangling atom file once used to generate Gemini news feeds suddenly went back online causing all items to be duplicated. Aren&rsquo;t new releases with shady notes documenting the changes great.</p>
<p>Apologies dear RSS readers. The issue has been fixed for a few days now but it seems that most readers like to cache results so if you&rsquo;re still seeing double please press that <em>Purge Cache Now</em> button.</p>
<p>And thanks for reading <em>Brain Baking</em>!</p>
