While the iOS vs. Android debate has been going on for nearly two decades, one lawmaker in Utah has taken it to the next level with a strange new twist.<br/>

According to <a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51436458/iphone-vs-android-this-lawmaker-wants-utah-to-officially-weigh-in">Utah news station KSL</a>, Utah State Senator Kirk Cullimore (R-Sandy) has proposed a new bill that would designate Android as the state's official mobile operating system. It is a <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2026/bills/static/SB0138.html">real bill</a> that would amend an existing Utah law outlining the state's official bird, fruit, song, flower, dinosaur, winter sports, and more.<br/>
<br/>
"Utah's state mobile operating system is Android," the proposed amendment reads.<br/>
<br/>
"Someday, everybody with an iPhone will realize that the technology is better on Android," said Cullimore, according to the report. "I'm the only one in my family – all my kids, my wife, they all have iPhones – but I'm holding strong," he added.<br/>
<br/>
The change would take effect on May 6, if the bill were to be passed and signed into law. However, it seems to be a publicity stunt more than anything.<br/>
<br/>
"I don't expect this to really get out of committee," said Cullimore.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/22/utah-iphone-vs-android/">Utah Adds a Strange Twist to the iPhone vs. Android Debate</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/utah-adds-a-strange-twist-to-the-iphone-vs-android-debate.2476438/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
