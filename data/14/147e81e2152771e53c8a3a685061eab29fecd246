macOS Tahoe is coming out next Monday, and Apple provided the release candidate (RC) version of the software earlier this week. The RC came with notes highlighting the features that Apple believes are most important.<br/>

Apple has changed up the way that it provides release notes for macOS, and rather than a list of features, there's a carousel with more detailed descriptions of key additions and images to go along with each feature.<blockquote><strong>New design featuring Liquid Glass</strong><br/>
The new design makes the iconic elements of macOS fresh yet familiar. A transparent menubar makes your display feel larger. Apps with Liquid Glass sidebars and toolbars reflect and refract what you're viewing, drawing more focus to your content. And you can personalize icons and widgets, giving them a light, dark, tinted, or new clear look to match your style.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Customize the look of folders</strong><br/>
To make folders easy to recognize, you can give them a distinctive appearance. You can now choose a unique color and add emoji or symbol<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Personalize Control Center</strong><br/>
Enjoy more ways to customize which controls appear in Control Center, and how they're laid out. Add new controls from Mac and even iPhone apps, including from your favorite third-party apps. Arrange them however you like, and even create pages of controls. You can also place controls right into the menu bar for easier access.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Communicate seamlessly across languages with Live Translation</strong><br/>
With Apple Intelligence, Live Translation helps you automatically translate text in Messages, follow along with live-translated captions in FaceTime calls, or listen to a real-time audio transcription spoken aloud in the Phone app. It works entirely on-device so your personal conversations stay private.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Create incredibly powerful shortcuts</strong><br/>
The Shortcuts app is supercharged with Apple Intelligence. Intelligent actions can summarize text, create images, or tap directly into Apple Intelligence models. And with automations on Mac, you can make shortcuts run automatically based on conditions, such as the time of day, file or folder updates, connecting to an external monitor, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>New options for making Genmoji</strong><br/>
Mix your favorite emoji together with descriptions to make something brand new. And get more control over Genmoji inspired by family and friends, with new options like hairstyle customization to help you match their latest look.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>More ways to create the perfect image in Image Playground</strong><br/>
Get more control over images inspired by people from your photo library, with new options to change their expressions or hairstyle to match their latest look. You can also access new ChatGPT styles, like Watercolor or Oil Painting, and use Any Style to describe what you want.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>See Live Activities from iPhone on Mac</strong><br/>
Continuity gets even better with Live Activities. Easily stay on top of activities that you started on iPhone, like tracking the progress of your order from Uber Eats, right from the menu bar on Mac. You can even click on the Live Activity to open the app in iPhone Mirroring.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>All-new Phone app</strong><br/>
Powered by Continuity, the new Phone app for Mac lets you relay cellular calls from your nearby iPhone. Call Screening can help you manage unwanted calls by finding out who's calling and why, without interrupting you. You can also access familiar features--including Recents, Contacts, and Voicemails--and new ones like Hold Assist and Live Translation.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Focus your Messages conversations</strong><br/>
To help you focus on what matters, new screening tools filter out unknown numbers from your conversation list until you mark them as known, and on-device spam detection helps filter out spam. You can also add a background to your conversation to give it a distinctive look. And send polls to friends and family over iMessage and watch the votes come in live.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Discover new ways to browse in Spotlight</strong><br/>
Spotlight makes it easy to see all your apps, locate recent or suggested files, discover actions you can take, and view your clipboard history. Just launch Spotlight from the menu bar and select the Applications, Files, Actions, or Clipboard button, which will appear next to the search field.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Take actions directly from Spotlight</strong><br/>
You can now take hundreds of new system and app actions right from Spotlight, such as sending messages, creating an event, and running shortcuts, all without lifting your hands off the keyboard. And to get things done faster, Spotlight automatically assigns quick keys to actions you take, so you can execute them in just a few characters.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Experience the new Apple Games app</strong><br/>
The Apple Games app is your one-stop gaming destination. Discover the latest updates across your games, such as in-game events, major updates, and games your friends are playing. Access your entire game library. And compete with friends in challenges.</blockquote>macOS Tahoe will launch on September 15 alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a>, visionOS 26, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a>, and tvOS 26.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-tahoe.250">macOS Tahoe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/11/macos-tahoe-26-release-notes/">Here Are Apple&#039;s macOS Tahoe 26 Release Notes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-apples-macos-tahoe-26-release-notes.2465381/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
