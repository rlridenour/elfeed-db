In case you don’t know it, we can use raw strings, like embedding JS code, in hiccup.</p>
<p>
I just found out we can use <a href="https://weavejester.github.io/hiccup/hiccup2.core.html#var-raw">raw</a> to prevent strings from getting escaped. I used to have to define a dedicated app.js for that, which would need an extra HTTP request.</p>

Looking back, I should’ve found this at the very beginning, as it’s just mentioned on <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">its GitHub homepage</a>, but somehow I missed it.</p>
