<p>I enjoyed <a href="https://youtu.be/j31dmodZ-5c?si=ZqUasA3Ye-4Z1tdS">this recent MDBHD video</a> about the Neo Humanoid Robot. It’s a robot that you can buy/rent to put in your house as a robot housekeeper. It seems really rough around the edges, and it will require an actual human at Neo to drive it around.</p>



<p>It seems hardly ready for prime time. <em>And yet …</em></p>



<p>I’m increasingly convinced that we will see useful domestic robots in my lifetime. I wonder, however, if they’ll actually be humanoid shaped or more like advanced iterations of robot vacuums that can also clean up, and fetch the remote. The disruption train just keeps rolling.</p>
