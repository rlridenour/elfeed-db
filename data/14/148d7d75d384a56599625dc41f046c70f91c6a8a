Apple is still working on a Ring-like home security camera that will integrate into the Home app, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-13/apple-s-ai-turnaround-plan-robots-lifelike-siri-and-home-security-cameras">Bloomberg</a></em>. It's unclear when the camera might launch, but it could come alongside or after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-smart-home-hub-2026/">the smart home hub</a> that's expected in 2026.<br/>

The camera will feature a battery that could last for several months to a year, and it in addition to being useful for security, it will be able to detect people and sense motion for Home automation purposes. From <em>Bloomberg</em>:<br/>
<blockquote>The device has facial recognition and infrared sensors to determine who is in a room. Apple believes users will place cameras throughout their home to help with automation. That could mean turning lights off when someone leaves a room or automatically playing music liked by a particular family member.</blockquote><br/>
Apple is working on multiple types of cameras and home security products, including a doorbell that uses facial recognition for unlocking a door. Apple is aiming to establish a foothold in the smart home product market, competing with Amazon's Ring brand and Google's Nest brand.<br/>
