Sharing of books read and of an opening to a story I&rsquo;ve long-considered.

Writing as Human Expression &amp; Connection</a>.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite" cite="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/peasant-woodland">

We receive our writing as a gift, and so it must be given in turn. We write
because something needs to be expressed through us, and only by giving the
writing to a reader is that need fulfilled.

<p>Where books may be the magic, writing is the alchemical catalyst that “makes”
the magic.  A catalyst in that it does not destroy the source—that is what we
have read and synthesized—but instead issues forth an altogether transforming
thing.</p>
<h2 id="books-as-guard-against-isolation">Books as Guard Against Isolation</h2>
<p>Throughout my life I’ve felt varying degrees of isolation.  I also want to
separate isolation from solitude.  I enjoy solitude, a chance to be fully with
my thoughts and emotions, with minimal stimulus.</p>
<p>But isolation, that is something else.  A sense of separation from something
greater.</p>
<p>To remedy that, I know now, is to seek and be with people who demonstrate
Love.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> As defined by M Scott Peck and brought to my attention by bell hooks: “The
will to extend one’s self for the purpose of nurturing one’s own or another’s
spiritual (e.g., body, mind, spirit) growth.”<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>Why Love?  Isolation brings about the collapsing of identity into an ever
narrowing confine.  Whereas Love nurtures growth.</p>
<p>And those people I seek?</p>
<p>They are myriad: those whom I’ve physically hugged as well as those who
have taken time to share a bit of themselves, that is Truth, through their art.</p>

<p>Their clear words erupt as lightning etched in the night sky.  Creating, for a

<p>On a different <time datetime="2024-12-02" title="2024-12-02">today</time> I started reading <cite data-id="26A608F1-70C2-4E23-9DA0-B2C978D5BB52">The Power of the Powerless</cite> by

<h3 id="raising-my-standards">Raising my Standards</h3>
<p>In <time datetime="2019" title="2019">2019</time>, I wrote about my 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2019/05/19/reading-challenges/">Reading Challenges</a></cite>, namely that for <time datetime="2019" title="2019">2019</time> I was going
to limit my book reading to women authors.  This deliberate challenge shifted my
1reading habits.  I’m more discerning, ready to set down a book, knowing that
there are perhaps better sources.<small class="side-container">

  <span class="side" role="note"> <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/02/booklish/">Corey Doctorow also practices setting aside books that he isn’t enjoying</a>.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>One recent example, I set aside reading <cite data-id="37F1A94E-E29E-4745-8C05-FD507311E2C9">The Mists of Avalon</cite> and shifted to
reading (and finishing) Nicola Griffith’s <cite data-id="B18FF3E3-E506-4883-9F81-C4BB74B32E80">Spear</cite>.</p>
<p>Why?  In part because my friend Judd shared that <cite data-id="B18FF3E3-E506-4883-9F81-C4BB74B32E80">Spear</cite> “is a fun,
more recent and very Queer bit of Arthuriana (that somehow feels old and I mean
that as a compliment).”</p>
<p>Also because I wasn’t prepared nor interested in engaging with Marion Zimmer
Bradley’s framing of Gwenhwyfar: a timid and fearful Christ-driven manipulator.
A sleight of hands of shifting the “villain” from one woman to another.</p>
<p>Whereas <cite data-id="B18FF3E3-E506-4883-9F81-C4BB74B32E80">Spear</cite> is poetic and mythic yet not in a high register
(e.g. Spencer, Mallory, Milton) but in one more akin to Seamus Heaney, Ursula K
le Guin, and Emily Wilson, accessible and lyrical.</p>
<p>And, as I wrote in 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2024/11/19/spear-by-nicola-griffith/">“Spear” by Nicola Griffith</a></cite>, I see the plurality of
representation.  Subverting tropes while honoring the archetypes.</p>
<p>With <cite data-id="B18FF3E3-E506-4883-9F81-C4BB74B32E80">Spear</cite> finished, I started and finished <cite data-id="A6B3DC34-C462-46BC-8CD7-D89BDC31D6EB">The Once and Future King</cite> by T.H. White.  What an amazing re-framing of <cite data-id="81AAA17D-763D-47BD-9924-C06ED85214C3">Le Morte d’Arthur</cite> by Thomas Mallory.</p>
<p>I found the Guenever of <cite data-id="A6B3DC34-C462-46BC-8CD7-D89BDC31D6EB">The Once and Future King</cite> to be interesting and
actualized, given humanity and agency.  And appreciate <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/5/18/15649214/once-and-future-king-th-white-king-arthur">Why The Once and Future
King is still the best King Arthur story out there</a>.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-03-27" title="2025-03-27">Recently</time> I found <cite>T.H. White&rsquo;s Defence of Guenever: Portrait of a &ldquo;Real&rdquo; Person</cite>in <a href="https://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol21/iss1/2/">Issue 1 of Volume 21 of Mythlore</a> to really contextualize the
brilliant recasting of Guenever; not as something different but as someone more
human.  An equal member in the Arthur, Lancelot and Guenever triumvirate.</p>
<p>Which had me thinking of other triples: Mordred, Morgause, and Gawain;
themselves morally impoverished shadows of their analogues.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>Turning from reading to writing, my hope is that what I publish finds a few
places that cherish the gift.</p>
<p>I write to learn more about myself and the worlds within which I move.  I
publish to share bits of what I’ve learned; and by extension a bit of myself.</p>
<h3 id="an-opening-to-a-story">An Opening to a Story</h3>
<p>The following is my latest draft of an opening scene of a book I’ve long
considered.  The story coming to me en route to a friends wedding; a moment when
I was divorced and alone.</p>
<p>The physicality of the character is very much me describing myself.  I have
physically enacted each of these moments, so I can think about how I might
describe them.</p>
<p>The underlying situation of the story is different from mine, but close enough
that I could view it from my perch.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

<p>He shambled down the stairs, clinging to both railing and last night’s dream,
hoping to stumble into remembering and not down the stairs again.  Deliberate in
each step through his pre-caffeine fog, focusing one foot forward then down onto
the center of the red-dyed wool carpet runner.</p>
<p>Mid-flight he paused feet on staggered stairs.  His heart ached at the thought
of losing him again.  Of the joy of dream’s reunion, and the anguish of being
again wrenched away.  He thought of climbing back into bed and seek, in vain he
knew, to re-open that dream’s door.</p>
<p>His hand touched the plaster wall, painted a warm green; he never did have an
eye for color, leaving that to her.  And while he could’ve re-painted, he knew
he’d never create such a harmonious palette of base colors.  He simply didn’t
have the eye for it.  Instead he lived amidst her vision.</p>
<p>A reminder of what was.  He thought of his father’s words, “Divorce is a funeral
you live each day.”  As months turned to years, the sense of a funeral remained;
but instead of it being for someone close, it now felt like a distant great
aunt; one who had lived into her 90s, and outlived most everyone who might
attend her funeral.  A celebration of what was, more than of what was lost.</p>
<p>He really shouldn’t linger on the stairs, he thought to himself—at least find
somewhere level before you break down he half-muttered.  Letting gravity tip the
scale, he scurried down the stairs and collapsed on the landing, staring into
the full length mirror that hung on the oaken door behind which was a small coat
closet.  He could roll to his left and topple one step further onto the main
floor of the living room.  Or lean forward, touching forehead to forehead with
his reflection.</p>
<p>But instead, he sat with his feet on the floor, knees up.  His hands wrapping
around his shins.  He rocked forward and back.  Eyes locking with that
stranger in front of him.  How had he gotten this old?  He thought as he looked
at the crows feet about his eyes and sagging skin above his eyebrow that each
year sunk a bit deeper, leading more and more folks to comment that he looked
tired.</p>
<p>His hair disheveled in its race between gray and gone.  He gazed into those
green eyes, long familiar, though framed now by a face far older than he thought
of himself.  The whites showed a red of the myriad of capillaries agitated as
the tears welled up.</p>
<p>He let out a staccato breath, holding and releasing in bursts that were he to
lose control, would become a blubbering wail.  He slowed his breathing, and
tears dripped down his face.  The dream was gone…shattered and cutting him once
more.  Time had shown that he could cope with losing her, but not him.</p>

<h3 id="why-share-this">Why Share This?</h3>
<p>Why write this and share this?  First, it is something I struggle to approach.
I know in my framing that the story will wriggle and writhe autobiographically
close to me.  And it feels daunting to gaze upon that serpent.</p>
<p>This morning, I gathered up a quote from Faulkner:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

The past is never dead.  It&rsquo;s not even past.  All of us labor in webs spun long
before we were born, webs of heredity and environment, of desire and
consequence, of history and eternity.  Haunted by wrong turns and roads not
taken, we pursue images perceived as new but whose providence dates to the dim
dramas of childhood, which are themselves but ripples of consequence echoing
down the generations.  The quotidian demands of life distract from this
resonance of images and events, but some of us feel it always.

</blockquote>

<p>Pause and consider: “the daily demands of life distract from the resonance of
images and events.”  Writing is one opportunity to channel through me that which
is within and around me.  To taste life and memory.  To seek the poetic and
lyrical and glimpse the divine.</p>
