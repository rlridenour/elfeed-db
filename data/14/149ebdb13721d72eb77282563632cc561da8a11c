<p>A large fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping complex in Karachi, Pakistan, and rescuers have been searching the building for people reported missing after families raised alarms. Reported death toll figures vary by outlet, ranging from 11 to 14 as recovery operations continue and officials warn the number could rise. The blaze burned for more than 24 hours before it was brought under control, leaving a hazardous structure that has complicated efforts to reach all areas safely. Authorities say they are investigating what caused the fire.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wyWJtO2ElwngMFAW6yvjP36tjlwiC_hDTgPg1cDC9o0WNLjDW10CJrs7W-me1q4J3pYphmP9OKTSz5biPI7QRpGVhgN_vzNtaU8IQZWC1wYQ3N5CvaoajuOrQXpYwWD8BxxjjlfdBSRZo-kmSaOrX-2qmTrC4fhMBdnusUQ39PF0qgqvJ9pMObz45zbbZQis_P84eMQ0qSa6aJFitQ' alt='Smoke and firefighting efforts at Gul Plaza in Karachi after the blaze.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of site: Gul Plaza is described as a sprawling complex with about 1,200 shops in Karachi’s historic centre, spread across an area larger than a football field.</li><li>Search trigger: Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said families reported roughly 60 people missing, which prompted authorities to launch a search operation.</li><li>Army support: Rescue work has involved civilian teams supported by the army, according to reporting on the ongoing operation.</li><li>Compensation pledge: Authorities have said they will provide compensation to affected families as investigations and recovery efforts continue.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Sindh provincial leadership: The provincial government says missing-person reports from families led officials to begin a focused search inside the damaged complex.
