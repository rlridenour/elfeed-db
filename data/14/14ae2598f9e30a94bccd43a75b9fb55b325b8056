Apple researchers have released <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19808">Pico-Banana-400K</a>, a comprehensive dataset of 400,000 curated images that's been specifically designed to improve how AI systems edit photos based on text prompts.<br/>

The massive dataset aims to address what Apple describes as a gap in current AI image editing training. While systems like GPT-4o can make impressive edits, the researchers say progress has been limited by inadequate training data built from real photographs. Apple's new dataset aims to improve the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Pico-Banana-400K features images organized into 35 different edit types across eight categories, from basic adjustments like color changes to complex transformations such as converting people into Pixar-style characters or LEGO figures. Each image went through Apple's AI-powered quality control system, with Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro being used to evaluate the results based on instruction compliance and technical quality.<br/>
<br/>
The dataset also includes three specialized subsets: 258,000 single-edit examples for basic training, 56,000 preference pairs comparing successful and failed edits, and 72,000 multi-turn sequences showing how images evolve through multiple consecutive edits.<br/>
<br/>
Apple built the dataset using Google's Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image (aka Nano-Banana) editing model, which was released just a few months ago. However, Apple's research revealed its limitations. While global style changes succeeded 93% of the time, precise tasks like relocating objects or editing text seriously struggled, with success rates below 60%.<br/>

Despite the limitations, researchers say their aim with Pico-Banana-400K is to establish "a robust foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided image editing models." The <a href="https://github.com/apple/pico-banana-400k">complete dataset is freely available</a> for non-commercial research use on GitHub, so developers can use it to train more capable image editing AI.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/29/apple-ai-dataset-improve-photo-editing-models/">Apple&#039;s New AI Dataset Aims to Improve Photo Editing Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-ai-dataset-aims-to-improve-photo-editing-models.2470059/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
