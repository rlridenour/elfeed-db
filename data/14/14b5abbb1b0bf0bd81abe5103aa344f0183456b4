Apple's first foldable iPhone will reportedly drop the physical SIM card slot in favor of eSIM technology, according to a well-known Chinese leaker posting on Weibo today.<br/>

Apple is expected to introduce the device late next year or in early 2027, based on multiple reports. The so-called "iPhone Fold" is <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">rumored</a> to feature a 5.5-inch outer display and a book-style design that opens to reveal a roughly 7.8-inch inner screen reminiscent of an iPad mini.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/foldable-iphone-like-two-iphone-airs/">described</a> the foldable as "super thin and a design achievement," comparing it to "two titanium iPhone Airs side by side." Internal volume will therefore be tightly constrained.<br/>
<br/>
"It's highly likely that the foldable iPhone will come without a SIM card slot, supporting eSIM only," said leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/QgSovlgv6">Instant Digital</a>, echoing earlier expectations from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/foldable-iphone-rumored-features/">Gurman</a> and analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/kuo-foldable-iphone-entering-mass-production-this-year/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital also highlighted the current shortcomings of eSIM in mainland China, where users strongly prefer physical SIM activation and dual-SIM slots. China's fast-moving resale and device-trial culture makes quick SIM transfers essential, meaning an eSIM-only foldable would rely heavily on seamless carrier provisioning.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is aware of the hurdles. The iPhone Air, which adopted an eSIM-only design for similar space-driven reasons, depends on dedicated support from China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom. It allows up to two active eSIMs, but activation still requires an in-store visit.<br/>
<br/>
Globally, iPhone Air sales have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/iphone-air-supply-chain-cuts/">undershot expectations</a>, to say the least. Many consumers have focused less on its thin profile and more on the trade-offs it introduced, such as reduced battery life and a single rear camera. In China, the eSIM limitation will have surely added another layer of hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
The foldable iPhone is rumored to introduce several new technologies, including a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/07/iphone-fold-24mp-under-display-camera/">24-megapixel under-display camera</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/iphone-fold-2026-engineering-validation/">crease-free</a> inner panel. Apple will be banking on these advances to overcome concerns about usability, especially in markets where eSIM adoption lags.<br/>
