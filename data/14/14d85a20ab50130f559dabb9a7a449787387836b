I've been giving myself more time to just enjoy
drawing: not trying to untangle a thought, just
wandering around and seeing where the lines and
colours take me. While looking for examples of
sketchnotes for self-facilitation for my post on
<a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/07/finding-the-shape-of-my-thoughts/">finding the shape of my thoughts</a>, I came across
<a href="https://www.creativesouldenisenicole.com/soap-box/2019/9/4/sketchnotes-changing-the-way-you-see-yournbspthoughts">Sketchnotes: Changing The Way You See
Your Thoughts — Creative Soul of Denise Nicole</a>. I
liked the <a href="https://www.creativesouldenisenicole.com/soap-box/2019/9/4/sketchnotes-changing-the-way-you-see-yournbspthoughts#:~:text=I%20use%20it%20to%20practice%20quick%20sketches%20of%20icons%20that%20could%20be%20used%20during%20sketchnote%20taking.">ABC exercise near the bottom</a>. For fun, I
copied the same words and tried my own spin on
things.

When A+ saw what I was doing, she asked me to swap
out my meeting icon from "people around a table"
to her online meetings at virtual school. She even
added details: "This is the kid with the Minecraft
background, this is the kid with big
headphones&hellip;" I enjoyed watching her in this
state of playful focus. I wonder what else I can
draw that she might have fun taking over.
"Meeting" is my favourite one in this set, but
since that's mostly A+'s, my next favourite is
"freeze." Canada gets even colder than -20C, but
for me, -20C is definitely stay inside weather.

I've also been enjoying Kamo's books, like <a href="https://www.tuttlepublishing.com/japan/how-to-draw-cute-doodles-and-illustrations">How to
Draw Cute Doodles and Illustrations</a>. Her style
reminds me of the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/120901-illustration-school">Illustration School</a> series by Sachiko
Umoto, which I also liked. I think I tend towards
simple and approachable rather than realistic or
technically impressive. Learning how to draw
concrete things might help me get better at
drawing abstract things. It's fun to slow down and
pay attention to more details, too. Turns out I'd
been drawing guitar holes in the wrong place all
this time. Now I know!
