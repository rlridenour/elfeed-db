<p>I am currently using <code>vc-mode</code> for my source code configuration needs.  I wouldn’t call myself a die-hard <code>vc-mode</code> user, (at least not yet!). To earn that title, I think I would need years of experience with it and scoffing at this newfangled thing they call <code>magit</code>, while my muscle memory recoils at the thought of reading and interacting with a transient menu!</p>

<p>If that were the case, I’d fully embrace the label of a die-hard holdout. But in reality, that just isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>My version control history has been, well, complicated, or to put it another way, quite simple. It largely revolves around that ancient system known as Subversion (<code>svn</code>), and leveraging it through the good old command line. It wasn’t until the past couple of years that I even stepped into the Emacs version control ecosystem. So where to start? Naturally, I had heard a lot of praise for <code>magit</code>.</p>
<p>First question (and I suspect the usual question): how do you even pronounce it? A soft &ldquo;g&rdquo; like in <strong>magic</strong>? That sounds better, even if it doesn’t make much sense. Then again, given that I’d likely never discuss it with colleagues at work, pronunciation hardly matters.</p>
<p>Anyway, I happily &ldquo;magited&rdquo; for a year or so (ironically, I think I learned more about Git&rsquo;s command line through <code>magit</code> than I would have otherwise). I would have continued using it too, except I decided to make a mental paradigm shift regarding my use in Emacs in general.</p>
<p>I had reached a point where I think I knew enough Emacs Lisp to start replacing many external packages with custom functions. It was a personal challenge, an opportunity to deepen my understanding of <code>elisp</code> and tackle more advanced customization. What better way to learn than by replacing something like <code>ace-window</code>? As it turns out, most of these substitutions were fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>But <code>magit</code>? Now that was a tough one. Should I create my own transient menu?, or a more basic menu system? It’s Git, so that could quickly become a tangled mess of options. At the same time, I couldn’t ignore my need for Subversion support at work. <code>magit</code>, as great as it is, is Git-only (though <code>git svn</code> exists).</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a version control system that seamlessly handled multiple backends?</p>
<p>Turns out (as we already know), Emacs has one built-in and that is <code>vc-mode</code>.</p>
<p>I’ve now been using <code>vc-mode</code> for about a year. I still appreciate <code>magit</code>, but for my current workflow, balancing Git for personal projects and Subversion at work, <code>vc-mode</code> gets the job done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not generally using Git in any advanced fashion anyway and if I do need to drop into the command line then I can just open up a terminal in emacs.</p>
<p>Yes <code>vc-mode</code> has its limitations, for example, why is creating a tag not part of the default keymap of <code>vc-dir</code>?, actually I think it is and I vaguely remember activating it through <code>vc-create-branch</code>, was it a universal argument?, I can&rsquo;t remember, but how about just doing things the old-fashioned way, <code>M-x vc-create-tag</code>?, that works fine for me.  Maybe in the not too near future I can yak shave that away anyway! :)</p>
<p>So far with <code>vc-mode</code> I’ve made some small improvements, which I shall share in future blog posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding the ability to toggle tracked files on and off.</li>
<li>Displaying the current branch permanently in the <code>vc-dir</code> header line.</li>
</ul>
<p>And actually the <code>vc-mode</code> tweaks above were the original topic of this post, but I seem to have rambled on long enough&hellip;</p>
