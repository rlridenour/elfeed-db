</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A brief meditation on a just finished book.
</p>
        <p><time datetime="2025-09-07" title="2025-09-07">This morning</time> I finished <cite data-id="ithaca-by-claire-north">Ithaca</cite> by Claire North and am eager to get the second
book of the series.  In <cite data-id="ithaca-by-claire-north">Ithaca</cite>, we follow Penelope—by way of Hera as
narrator—and a few others as they navigate the years of suitors feasting in the
halls of the King of Ithaca.  Odysseus is far removed; and women are the main
players of the stage.</p>
<p>I’m of mixed emotions regarding the writing style; but I revel and enjoy North’s
filling of gaps around the larger Greek mythos, namely the Odyssey.
Contributing to a story that itself was most likely told and retold, folding in
other narratives.  Ever is there commentary, from Hera, that poets sing not of
women nor the enslaved; yet here, this story shows the fragile web on which
women navigate and claim power.</p>
<p>Back to that writing style, and why the mixed emotions?  I give space for my
emotions settle-in.  I interrogate them and their apparent inconsistency.  My
greatest issue is that I recollect a few turn of phrases that feel just a bit
out of place.  Not quite of the mythic fabric in which I place the
<cite>Odyssey</cite>and <cite>Iliad</cite>—a few wild threads just a bit off from
the narrative style.  Yet, I think this helps gentle pull the larger tapestry into a
new light, one just a bit more visible to a here and now.</p>
<p>And to be clear, there were only a few.  Then there are the other cases in which
the primacy of Greek emotion; of meddling gods and the bounds of duty cover the
story.  Cover as Laertes funerary shroud—something Penelope weaves and undoes as
a matter of survival.  North, stitching often in harmony with the poetics, yet
on occasion, pulling out a row, so as to survive these “modern” sensibilities.</p>
<p>So, as I sit and interrogate these emotions, I look to the affect: North has
enriched the Homeric narratives that I have internalized, both in reading of
translated primary sources, but also of those source’s echoing throughout the
English written corpus.</p>
<p>Even more, as I sit with this first of a trilogy, it is a tale of masking to
survive, of toxic masculinity, and of the fetters of hierarchy.  The casting of
the fate of a queen who must trust those she’s enslaved.  This is perhaps a
failing of imagination.  Yet maybe we need a few more stories of Penelope’s
liberation before we read those stories of her enslaved maids liberation?</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine Penelope holding out against the suitors without the
support of her enslaved.  There’s adequate narrative hinting that the stasis of
the suitors feasting in the halls is better for the enslaved than the chaos that
might ensue were Penelope to pick a suitor.  The enslaved perhaps recognizing
that Penelope’s authority over them is better tempered than those of a would-be
king.</p>
<p>Which perhaps this “partial liberation” seals the maids’ death when Odysseus
returns and famously kills suitors and maids alike.  I’ll find out when I get
around to the next book; one I’m eager to get from my local library.</p>
<p>The other book I’ve read focusing on Penelope is <cite data-id="FFFDC261-FA9A-40B6-832C-72F7B4B54E3A">The Penelopiad</cite> by Margaret Atwood; a telling written in a higher register and of events yet to come in
North’s <cite data-id="ithaca-by-claire-north">Ithaca</cite>.  I’m enchanted by these books in conversation with each other,
and a source material so deeply entrenched in our collective mythos.  Something
truly of the commons by which we can share.</p>
