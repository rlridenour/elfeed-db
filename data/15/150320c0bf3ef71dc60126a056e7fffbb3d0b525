<p>Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government will send humanitarian aid to Cuba, framing the move as a response to worsening living conditions and the risk of a humanitarian crisis on the island. The announcement comes as the Trump administration increases pressure on Cuba’s fuel supply, including President Trump saying he asked Mexico to suspend oil shipments to Cuba. At the same time, President Trump said the United States has begun talks with Cuban leaders—describing contacts with “the highest people” and expressing confidence that an agreement is possible—even as Washington pursues what several outlets describe as a de facto oil squeeze that is tightening fuel availability in Cuba. Together, the developments point to a mix of pressure, dialogue, and humanitarian gestures that could shape day-to-day conditions for Cubans in the near term.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/2JdX6BDfbEB_IWtyQvmZ56-BiaNMPth9i6F1r8lGoeAxuME9NGUI-4tcOpyzTt30QISmuCvMqi7mvIt_wLVUNYrH9q5NKuI8mUe1NRnwU39CxcaxVgjYFpAvb_BPThxpspisVpTwfbXibf4ECV5t-lPRuw-2FYOcQqXxJGdhdw' alt='Illustration image for Mexico’s pledge of humanitarian aid to Cuba amid U.S. pressure on fuel shipments.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>High-level contacts: President Trump said the U.S. is speaking with Cuba’s “highest people” and suggested a deal could be reachable, signaling a diplomatic channel alongside sanctions pressure.</li><li>Fuel squeeze: Reporting describes Washington’s approach as widening energy pressure meant to restrict Cuba’s fuel lifeline, contributing to tighter fuel availability on the island.</li><li>Mexico’s rationale: Sheinbaum warned of a potential humanitarian crisis in Cuba as part of Mexico’s justification for sending aid.</li><li>Policy tension: Sheinbaum’s aid pledge comes amid U.S. requests directed at Mexico to halt oil shipments to Cuba, highlighting differing priorities between neighbors that still coordinate closely.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Mexico (President Claudia Sheinbaum): Mexico plans to send humanitarian aid to Cuba and has warned that conditions could deteriorate into a humanitarian crisis.
