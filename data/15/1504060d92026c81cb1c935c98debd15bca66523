<p>I got asked how I manage papers, notes, and citations for doing research. I started writing out a <em>very</em> long Slack message, but it quickly passed the threshold where I ought to just turn it into a blog post.</p>
<p>The short of it: I&rsquo;m an incorrigible Emacs user, so I do a lot through my editor of choice on my laptop. That said, <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> is a fabulous piece of technology, and I rely on it heavily to get my work done.</p>

<p><strong>Use Zotero in some capacity.</strong> Zotero is great. You should use it at a minimum for collecting papers and keeping paper metadata. It&rsquo;s completely free and open source. It has excellent apps for iOS and Android so you can read and markup papers on a tablet and access everything on your desktop, but that&rsquo;s optional. It&rsquo;s so smart about finding citation information: drag a PDF into it and it will look for the DOI or something and auto-populate the relevant bibliographic information. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s still pretty darn helpful.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re starting out, I recommend using Zotero&rsquo;s hosted syncing purely because it&rsquo;s so easy to use. If you start being a paper packrat and need more than the 300 MB limit, you can self-host or pay a little for more storage. (I&rsquo;m using 797 MB after several years of heavy Zotero use—I even have a few books in my library!) The lovely thing is <em>you don&rsquo;t have to commit to syncing up-front</em>. You can start with purely local storage too if you want.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a LaTeX user like me, you should use the <a href="https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex">Better Bibtex</a> package. You can configure it to make a <code>.bib</code> file for your entire library or just certain collections. I keep a big <code>.bib</code> file for my entire library and then separate <code>.bib</code> files for each paper I write.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn1"></label>
<input id="sn1" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox">
<span class="sidenote">
As long as I am the sole author, that is. My advisor prefers manually managing bibliographies, so what I tend to do is manually copy the reference information from my main <code>.bib</code> file into the <code>.bib</code> file for our shared paper.

  My setup: hybrid of Emacs and Zotero
  <a class="anchor" href="#my-setup-hybrid-of-emacs-and-zotero">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m as close to an Emacs maximalist as you will find. Nevertheless, <em>I prefer reading and most note-taking outside of Emacs.</em> I read and annotate papers on my iPad, and Zotero syncs the annotations to my desktop.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m writing papers, I use the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar">Citar</a> package in Emacs. This makes it easy to find references and insert citations. Works for Markdown, Org-mode, and LaTeX files. If you&rsquo;re wondering whether or not it can do a particular thing, the answer is going to be &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a package to do that&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easy to add that functionality&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but Claude could probably get you pretty close in modifying it to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll still take some notes on a paper inside of Emacs, but Zotero is how I primarily manage annotations. When I do a literature review I&rsquo;ll make a big note in Emacs and just link to the papers that I&rsquo;m referencing.</p>

<p>If you are a plain-text maximalist and like to sync everything via Git or something, then you should be using Emacs. If you are strong enough to resit the pull of closed-format tools for this long, Emacs is for you. It is not a text editor; <em>it is a toolkit to build your ideal text editor</em>. If getting started is intimidating, try out <a href="https://codeberg.org/ashton314/emacs-bedrock">my starter kit</a>, which is basically a set of sane defaults with helpful commentary on how to customize it further. Using Emacs will enable you to build a workflow that is exactly tailored to your idiosyncrasies. It&rsquo;s an investment, but a worthy one.</p>
<p>So, if you are committed to the Emacs + plain text way, here is what I would recommend:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Still use Zotero to store papers &amp; associated metadata. Don&rsquo;t use it for annotations though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Emacs and install the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar">Citar</a> package. It ships with a function called <code>citar-open-entry-in-zotero</code> which can help you jump from Emacs → Zotero entry. I use this a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote">Denote</a> Zettelkasten-style personal knowledge management (PKM) system. This provides utilities to create notes with tags, links (and automatic backlinks!), etc. all in plain-text. Sync this with Git or whatever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tie Denote and Citar together with the <a href="https://github.com/pprevos/citar-denote">denote-citar</a> package. Now, when you search for a paper with Citar, you can open a notes file for that paper. When you do, you&rsquo;ll get a split screen: paper on the right, notes file on the left. If you use the <a href="https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools">pdf-tools package</a> (and you should) then you can even add annotations to the PDF inside of Emacs!</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The most important thing is that you build your own system. You have to own it. You might find it easier to adopt someone else&rsquo;s system, but you should be intentional about every habit you acquire. Be prepared to iterate.</p>
<p>I used to be rather rigid with how I organized papers. I found that extreme structure was more constricting than helpful, so there&rsquo;s a little messiness with how I&rsquo;m organized, and I&rsquo;m OK with that.</p>
