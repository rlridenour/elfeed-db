<p>From an August 21, 2025 <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-challenging-google-using-search-data">report in The Information</a> (paywalled up the wazoo, alas), however:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenAI also isn’t the only Google rival to use SerpApi data.
SerpApi’s website previously listed Apple as a customer. In
addition to partnering with Google on search, the iPhone maker
develops technology to power searches in Safari — a lucrative
deal that the judge overseeing the DOJ case could also nix.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was Apple removed from the list because they’re no longer (or never were?) a customer, or because they remain a customer but don’t want to be listed?</p>
