Apple is going all out with promotions for the popular Severance <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ show today, and as of right now, you'll find a new "Lumon Terminal Pro" <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/lumon-terminal-pro/">listed on Apple's Mac site</a>.<br/>

The Lumon Terminal Pro is designed to look similar to the machines that Severance employees like Mark S. and Helly R. use for macrodata refinement. The Terminal features a blue keyboard, a small display with wide bezels, and a trackball for navigation purposes.<br/>

Unfortunately, you can't actually buy a Lumon Terminal Pro, though it would undoubtedly sell well to Severance fans. Apple's page links to the company's actual Macs, and to a behind the scenes editing video <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/apple-behind-the-mac-severance/">that Apple shared this morning</a>.<br/>

The second season of Severance wrapped up last Thursday, so the entire series is now available to stream on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+. Apple renewed Severance for season three, and Severance director Ben Stiller has promised that it won't take another three years for us to get another season.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/lumon-terminal-pro/">Apple&#039;s Mac Site Features Fictional &#039;Lumon Terminal Pro&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-mac-site-features-fictional-lumon-terminal-pro.2454106/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
