<p>World leaders and senior officials are gathering in Munich, Germany, for the Munich Security Conference (MSC) starting February 13. The war in Ukraine, Gaza, nuclear risks, and the future of NATO—and the broader U.S.-led global order—are expected to dominate the agenda. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio traveled to the conference calling this a “defining moment,” a sign of how much is riding on the talks. A key backdrop is the state of U.S.-Europe ties under President Trump. The New York Times and The Straits Times report that European leaders are arriving focused on strains in the relationship, trying to keep cooperation intact while also weighing how to build more European capacity and independence. NATO defense ministers met in Brussels ahead of Munich to steady nerves amid tensions that PBS links to President Trump’s statements about Greenland—an indication that alliance politics may be as central in Munich as more traditional security threats.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gtOVWIXnef2pYhI5uYiQ2ugYcX0TpQEiA4mYPxGJ4O0k1wySkkoGOwEPAeJ8FkVSEJTvCAYHApqO9x7y4TA7PiwfOLvRGoV_LwJbKh_GeSwW_I6iJ5cyGwiYFAVd8VcrMX6VsHHigFYGYNeQxoFJEA746f5euh9279PLh7bIoXZGxjB2ZXzrRyXXbw' alt='Vice President JD Vance speaking at the Munich Security Conference last year.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Big attendance: The 2026 MSC is expected to draw more than 50 world leaders, underscoring the conference’s role as a key meeting point even during political strain.</li><li>US absent: Firstpost reports President Trump is not attending, and says Iranian leaders were not invited—shaping who can engage directly in Munich this year.</li><li>Democrats’ message: U.S. Democrats, including California Gov.
