Prices for RAM and NAND storage chips are surging lately due to high demand from companies building out AI servers, resulting in supply constraints.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that rising memory chip prices had a "minimal impact" on Apple's gross margin in the fourth quarter of the 2025 calendar year, but he does expect a "bit more of an impact" on the company's gross margin in the current quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Cook added that Apple is aware of the rising prices and "will look at a range of options to deal with that" over the long term, if necessary.<br/>

Apple reported <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/apple-1q-2026-earnings/">record-breaking revenue of &#36;143.8 billion</a> last quarter, up 16% year-over-year, and it is predicting similar 13% to 16% year-over-year growth and gross margin of 48% to 49% in the current quarter, so the company is still reporting impressive earnings results despite concerns surrounding memory chip prices. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/apple-responds-to-rising-memory-chip-prices/">Apple Responds to Skyrocketing RAM and Storage Chip Prices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-responds-to-skyrocketing-ram-and-storage-chip-prices.2476874/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
