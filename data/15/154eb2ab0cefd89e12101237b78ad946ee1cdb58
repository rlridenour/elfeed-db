Here is how Apple describes that game:<blockquote>In this quirky action game — an Apple Arcade exclusive — players expand their Katamari by rolling up objects scattered across the earth. Featuring unique and whimsical gameplay, and a captivating soundtrack that blends different genres, the game invites players to energize the king's "live stream" by rolling their Katamari to create stars. As users advance, comments from in-game fans appear, and the longer they play, the larger their audience grows. By completing the king's challenges and boosting their subscriber count, players can unlock dynamic new stages.</blockquote>More details about all six games can be found <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-arcade-launches-new-katamari-and-space-invaders-games-in-april/">in Apple's announcement</a> from last month.<br/>
