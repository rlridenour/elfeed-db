<p>After a 25-year run, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/02/macsurfer">the website MacSurfer closed in 2020</a>. But, as brought to my attention <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/macsurfer-returns/">two weeks ago by Nick Heer</a>, MacSurfer quietly returned in June. No one seemed to notice until this month.</p>

<p>The original MacSurfer was a bit of a weird site. Content-wise it was a daily headline aggregator, with no original news or commentary. That made a lot of sense in 1995 and for a few years thereafter, when the web was new. I remember reading it somewhat regularly back then. But one never really “read” MacSurfer — you scanned it. Even the name harks back to the very early web, when, <a href="https://www.netmom.com/surfing/who-invented-surfing-the-internet">somehow</a>, the idiom “surfing the Internet” took hold. (Thus <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/surfin-safari/1442871699">leading to</a> the name “Safari” for a web browser.) But MacSurfer stopped making as much sense with the advent of RSS, when it became easy to create your own custom aggregated collection of website sources. I didn’t want to dance on MacSurfer’s grave when it closed shop in 2020, but at the time, I couldn’t believe it hadn’t closed long before.</p>

<p>The revived MacSurfer hasn’t changed the concept, so I’m not sure who will read it now either. A firehose has a purpose, but it’s not for drinking.</p>

<p>The other thing that always struck me as strange about MacSurfer is that it was anonymous. There was no credit as to who was behind it. <a href="https://macdailynews.com/">MacDailyNews</a> is similar: longstanding and anonymous, and, to a lesser degree than MacSurfer, a bit of a firehose. But MacDailyNews’s unnamed author adds commentary to his posts. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/06/11/imessage-for-android">Crackpot</a> <a href="https://macdailynews.com/tag/president-trump/">wingnut</a> commentary, oftentimes, but commentary nonetheless. Pseudonyms have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain">long</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell">storied</a> history. But I think it’s weird — and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/on_the_accountability_of_unnamed_public_relations_spokespeople#fn3-2024-12-14">somewhat suspicious</a> — not to put any name at all on your work.</p>

<p>The new MacSurfer, like the old one, remains unsigned. But after <a href="https://schwarztech.net/articles/macsurfer-is-back">Eric Schwarz started blogging about</a> the mysterious return of the site after its half-decade absence, the new owner, Ken Turner, reached out and <a href="https://schwarztech.net/articles/interview-with-macsurfers-new-owner-ken-turner">agreed to an interview</a>.</p>
