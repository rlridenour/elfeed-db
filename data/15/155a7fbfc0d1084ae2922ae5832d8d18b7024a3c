<p>The US House of Representatives narrowly passed a resolution to end some tariffs President Trump imposed on Canadian goods under an “emergency” declaration tied to fentanyl trafficking. Six Republicans joined Democrats to back the measure, a rare moment in which the Republican-led chamber directly challenged a signature White House trade policy. The resolution takes aim at tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump used to set sweeping tariffs on Canada after declaring the fentanyl-related emergency last year. Several outlets say the vote is likely mostly symbolic, since President Trump is expected to veto the measure if it reaches his desk. Meanwhile, the political temperature rose: President Trump warned Republican lawmakers on social media that those who vote against tariffs will face “consequences” in elections and primaries.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/toP23hHo54nsdhnpz98Dp9dILEWCQUP9kcBhSG0X-HsbzKQh262bfJNektJ-oi_HbhhqwqeT2WNjSu6D6QIlHeQ6csP9eIu_19SYrGTgiMMNVxU45i4oV6QG3l9DuGs6lRftL-blsp0fFr3gQix_NwABoSFJVhug-RSwpWY3BRBI7saXS3NvHW4w4EV6v5xlf-Kb0DzA5lLCCYny-psPS_XnC-ezR2jiHEsUXdj7_iYZVUWEfqnIjiKI-JbILjIazeTzqg51jyVj4Nqw-A' alt='Canadian and American flags fly on the Canadian side of the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ont.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Named GOP defectors: The six Republicans who voted with Democrats were Don Bacon, Thomas Massie, Brian Fitzpatrick, Kevin Kiley, Dan Newhouse and Jeff Hurd, while Democrat Jared Golden voted no.</li><li>Politics and polls: The South China Morning Post called the House rebuke a notable sign of internal party pushback as President Trump’s popularity has slipped, though it said an immediate policy shift remains unlikely.</li></ul><blockquote>Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries! - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: He defended tariffs as part of an economic and national security strategy and warned Republican dissenters of electoral “consequences,” emphasizing primary challenges.
