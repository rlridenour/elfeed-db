<p>Carl Pullein, one of my time management mentors, thinks we should keep our task managers lean, and therefore free of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>might-do” tasks. Those, he says, belong in our notes (app or book).</p>
<p>I see his point, but only half agree.</p>
<p>Capturing might-do’s into my task manager is convenient so that’s what I do. The On Hold tag I give to this kind of task means they are a resource, not clutter. They show up during weekly and monthly review times and are then either promoted to a more specific time sector, moved to their own notes page in Obsidian, or deleted.</p>
<p>Past-me might have used Drafts to append all these might-do ideas to specific files in my Obsidian vault, via tags and the Auto Move plugin. Present-me can’t be bothered with all that, and is happy to continue capturing at will and reviewing / moving later.</p>
<p>Next week I’ll be looking in more detail at the time sectors that form a vital foundation for the way I manage tasks. They aren’t quite the same as Carl’s because they’re designed for the way I like to work.</p>
<h3 id="news---the-johnny-decimal-workbook-is-now-free">News - the Johnny Decimal Workbook is now free</h3>
<p>John Noble, my digital organisation mentor, has just made his <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/20-29-communication/22-blog/22.00.0148-the-workbook-is-free/" target="_blank">Johnny Decimal Workbook</a>, free. I love this kind of generosity, though I still think the book is worth paying for. He and I can agree to disagree on that one!</p>
<p>The Johnny Decimal Workbook gives you all you need to get your digital files under control, but if you want a head start I wholeheartedly recommend his <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/15-patterns-templates/15.03-life-admin-system/" target="_blank">Life Admin System</a>. I bought the Workbook when it first came out and went through the exercises as written, but found myself overthinking the categories.</p>
<p>Once I downloaded the Life Admin folder it was like a light went on: suddenly it was all clear! I mostly use the system as is, though I’ve added some categories to suit my own situation.</p>
<h3 id="disagree-and-curate-your-way-to-a-bespoke-system">Disagree and curate your way to a bespoke system</h3>
<p>Who are your time, task, and digital management mentors? Do you agree with every recommendation they make? Sometimes a pre-formed system (like Johnny’s Life Admin) is a great foundation, but rarely will an out-of-the-box solution be exactly what you need, long term, without some modifications.</p>
