<p> I do not care for the way <a rel="tag" class="hashtag u-tag u-category" href="https://plrj.org/tag/emacs/">#Emacs</a> and <a rel="tag" class="hashtag u-tag u-category" href="https://plrj.org/tag/orgmode/">#orgmode</a> handle clicking on links by default. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/szcvhk/stopping_mouse1_from_opening_urltype_links_in_org/">I am not alone</a>. What I want is for the left mouse button to behave as when I click anywhere else in the buffer. Middle click or double click should follow the link. Sadly, there is a reported bug about the mismatch between the documentation, the docstring, and the actual behavior of messing with the mouse and links in org. </p>
<p> First, before making any other changes, note that <b>clicking and holding</b> the mouse on a link for at east 450 milliseconds will not open the link. If that&rsquo;s enough for you, then go with joy! </p>
<p> Thanks again to Charles Choi, there is a solution. </p>
<p> First, set two variables before <code>orgmode</code> loads, probably at the very top of your <code>init</code>: </p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name"><em></em></label></p>
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp" id="nil">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">setq</span>
 org-mouse-1-follows-link nil
 mouse-1-click-in-non-selected-windows nil
 )
</pre>
</div>
<p> <code>org-mouse-1-follows-link nil</code> means that <code>org</code> should do nothing when the mouse clicks. We&rsquo;ll address that below. <code>mouse-1-click-in-non-selected-windows nil</code> makes it so accidentally clicking a link in an inactive window or frame doesn&rsquo;t follow the link—if I don&rsquo;t want it to happen in the focused window, why would I like it in others? </p>
<p> Stopping here is valid as middle click will follow the link. Wipe your brow and be done with it! Or, one could proceed into a world of menu manipulation for context… </p>
<p> M. Choi wrote an article about <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/customizing-the-emacs-context-menu.html">manipulating the mouse context menu</a> I will not duplicate here. I followed his recipes and added the whole thing to my config. Between &ldquo;Open file (buffer) in Finder&rdquo; and &ldquo;Look up in dictionary&rdquo; definitions I inserted this: </p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name"><em></em></label></p>
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp" id="nil">(mouse-set-point click)
(define-key-after menu [org-open-at-point]
  '(menu-item <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Open the thing"</span> org-open-at-point
              <span style="color: #483d8b;">:help</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Open thing at point"</span>))
</pre>
</div>
<p> It&rsquo;s a pretty great function: </p>
<p> <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Handling-Links.html">Handling Links (The Org Manual)</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p> Open thing at point. </p>
<p> The thing can be a link, citation, timestamp, footnote, src-block or tags. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <code>C-c C-o</code> does the same thing. </p>
<p> There might be some refinements one can suggest. </p>
