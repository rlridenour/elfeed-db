Apple's iPhone 18 lineup will introduce a major leap in memory performance, according to new information shared today by Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PpvMic2B5">Digital Chat Station</a>. Apple is reportedly planning to equip the 2026 models with a high-capacity six-channel LPDDR5X memory configuration, significantly upping the memory bandwidth for future AI features and multitasking.<br/>

Expanding the memory bandwidth should enable faster app switching, smoother multitasking, and significantly improved AI capabilities – all areas Apple would likely to heavily invest in as part of its broader Apple Intelligence strategy. Paired with the A20 Pro chip, which will reportedly be built using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/iphone-18-a20-chip-2nm-rumor/">TSMC's third-generation 3nm process</a>, the iPhone 18 Pro models would stand to benefit the most.<br/>
<br/>
The Weibo account Digital Chat Station has a decent track record with Apple product rumors, and they have previously shared accurate information about unreleased hardware from the broader semiconductor supply chain. Still, Apple's precise hardware plans could still evolve ahead of the iPhone 18's launch late next year.<br/>
<br/>
Before then, if supply chain shortages can be overcome, the iPhone 17 series is expected to see a move to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-12gb-ram-rumor/">12GB of RAM as standard across all models</a>. That transition is likely to set the stage for the more aggressive hardware upgrades rumored for 2025.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/29/iphone-18-six-channel-memory-rumor/">iPhone 18 to Use High Performance Six-Channel Memory, Claims Leaker</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-to-use-high-performance-six-channel-memory-claims-leaker.2456171/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
