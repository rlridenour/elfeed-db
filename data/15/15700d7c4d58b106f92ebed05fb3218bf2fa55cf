<blockquote>
  <p>YouTube on Tuesday announced it’s beginning to roll out
age-estimation technology in the U.S. to identify teen users in
order to provide a more age-appropriate experience. The company
says it will use a variety of signals to determine the users’
possible age, regardless of what the user entered as their
birthday when they signed up for an account.</p>

<p>Well-intentioned though I think this is, it still feels more than a little dystopian.</p>
