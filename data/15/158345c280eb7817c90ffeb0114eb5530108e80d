I&#39;m used to learning by practicing, so when I learned Clojure, I always kept an eye on chances to write code in it.</p>

Scripting is an excellent field to practice, but the experience is not so good. On the one hand, it&#39;s too hacky to wrap Clojure code in a shell script with the shell bang. On the other hand, the startup time of JVM is too long to hurt the user experience.</p>
