<p>Supply chain leaker Majin Bu has the scoop, including photos of the cases and their packaging, of Apple’s second attempt at a fabric-based successor to leather iPhone cases. Apple’s first attempt two years ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/finewoven">FineWoven</a>, was so unpopular that they didn’t even offer a premium level of Apple-branded cases last year with the iPhones 16.</p>

<p>Apple dropped all use of leather two years ago, including watch bands and wallets. FineWoven was kind of shitty for those too — it just wasn’t a durable material, but Apple put it to use on products that demand durability. I mean that’s the entire point of an iPhone case in particular. These new TechWoven cases look good, and I doubt Apple will make the same durability mistake twice. The new cases have metal buttons (yay) but also a bottom lip on the case (boo). No word yet on whether Apple will replace FineWoven with TechWoven for <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/watch/bands/finewoven">Apple Watch bands</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MA6W4ZM/A/iphone-finewoven-wallet-with-magsafe-black">MagSafe Wallets</a> too, but I bet they will. I doubt we’ll ever hear the word “FineWoven” again.</p>
