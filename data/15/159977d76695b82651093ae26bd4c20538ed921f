<p>Truly phenomenal video from Real Engineering about a genuinely phenomenal product. In my <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/09/airpods_pro_2_usbc">review of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2023</a> — a year after they originally shipped, when the cases were changed to use USB-C — I called them “the best single expression of Apple as a company today”. That remains true. AirPods exemplify everything that sets Apple apart: miniaturization, “it just works” ease of use, opinionated design (you get them in any color you want, so long as it’s white), and, most of all, joyfulness.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that Apple doesn’t brag enough about its engineering accomplishments these days. Under their previous CEO, they’d spend more time in product introduction explaining how things work, like a lecture in a 101 college course. I miss that. This Real Engineering video fills in those gaps.</p>
