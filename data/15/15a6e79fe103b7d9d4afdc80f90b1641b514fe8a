<p>The <strong>selected-window-accent-mode</strong> is now present on <strong>MELPA</strong> and is my first Emacs package!</p>
<p>It is designed to visually distinguish the currently selected window by applying a unique accent color to its fringes, mode line, header line, and margins.</p>

<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h2>
<p>To use left and bottom accent based on the themes highlight colour:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(use-package selected-window-accent-mode
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  :config (selected-window-accent-mode <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  :custom
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (selected-window-accent-fringe-thickness <span style="color:#ae81ff">10</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (selected-window-accent-custom-color <span style="color:#66d9ef">nil</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (selected-window-accent-mode-style <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;subtle</span>))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>OR define your own colour:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(use-package selected-window-accent-mode

<p>There exist a few Emacs packages that perform window highlighting but that don&rsquo;t quite provide the feature set of selected-window-accent.</p>
<p>selected-window-accent focusses more on clearly but non-intrusively highlighting the currently selected/focussed window by highlighting aspects of the window border without having to modify the appearance of non-selected windows, hence more akin to a tiling window manager.</p>
<h3 id="dimmer">dimmer</h3>
<p>&ldquo;This package provides a minor mode that indicates which buffer is currently active by dimming the faces in the other buffers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the closest in functionality to selected-window-accent, the difference being that dimmer dims non selected windows rather than accent the selected window.</p>
<p>dimmer can be used in conjunction and will complement selected-window-accent to further enhance the emphasizing of the selected window.</p>
<h3 id="hiwin">hiwin</h3>
<p>&ldquo;This package provides a minor-mode to change the background colour of the non active window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It uses overlays to highlight non active windows, so is similar to dimmer but is less subtle in its highlighting mechanism and hasn&rsquo;t been updated in excess of 10 years.</p>
<h3 id="color-theme-buffer-local">color-theme-buffer-local</h3>
<p>&ldquo;This package lets you set a color-theme on a per-buffer basis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike dimmer and hiwin this package isn&rsquo;t related to the concept of a selected window but more of defining different themes for different windows to distinguish them.</p>
<h3 id="solaire-mode">solaire-mode</h3>
<p>&ldquo;This package is designed to visually distinguish &ldquo;real&rdquo; buffers (i.e. file-visiting code buffers where you do most of your work) from &ldquo;unreal&rdquo; buffers (like popups, sidebars, log buffers, terminals, etc) by giving the latter a slightly different &ndash; often darker &ndash; background&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike dimmer and hiwin this package isn&rsquo;t related to the concept of a selected window but more of distinguishing between collections of IDE like elements within Emacs.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap-improvements">Roadmap / Improvements</h2>
<p><strong>TODO</strong> add darken desaturated and tab highlight examples to README</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong> define accent color hue adjustment</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong> define compensating margin</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong> Incorporate <code>mode-line-active</code> and <code>mode-line-inactive</code> somehow as this would make more sense especially in the &lsquo;default mode.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong> header-line not shown on window split - I have a funny feeling this could be very difficult, if not impossible!</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong> restore modeline height when switching between modes</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong> adjust the not selected-window margin to avoid little window navigation. disruption, hence translating a fringe pixel width to a number of margin characters, not quite sure how I am going to do this yet.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong> excess selected-window disruption in header-line. (not sure I can do much about this)</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong> define which theme face attribute to use as the main accent color - Currently the default is to use the <code>highlight</code> face</p>
<p><strong>WATCH</strong> possible overheads of updating visual elements for each window?</p>
<p><strong>WATCH</strong> careful with removing header-line on all windows, for example magit commit window and probably some others may need to add some logic depending on mode.</p>
