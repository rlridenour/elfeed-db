Apple has joined China's national digital product subsidy program through its own direct sales channels for the first time, enabling eligible customers in Beijing and Shanghai to receive government-backed discounts on select iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs (via <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3315680/apple-joins-chinas-subsidy-scheme-boost-sales-amid-heated-domestic-competition?module=perpetual_scroll_0&pgtype=article"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a>).<br/>

Apple customers in Shanghai can access the subsidies by purchasing qualifying devices in one of the city's eight Apple retail stores, while Beijing residents can receive the discount through Apple's online store, provided they use a Beijing shipping address. <br/>
<br/>
The program offers subsidies of up to 2,000 yuan (approximately &#36;278) on certain Apple products, with eligibility criteria determined by product type and price. Devices priced below 6,000 yuan (roughly &#36;835) receive a 15% discount, capped at 500 yuan, while some higher-value items such as Macs are eligible for a bigger discount.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Apple products were available under the subsidy program only through authorized third-party platforms such as JD.com and Alibaba's Taobao marketplace. This therefore marks the first time Apple's own online and retail stores have participated directly in the scheme.<br/>

Data from market analytics companies have painted a consistent picture of Apple's smartphone shipments in mainland China falling in 2025, making Apple the only one among the country's top five smartphone vendors to record a decline this year. By contrast, Xiaomi and Huawei have grown dramatically.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/scmp-com/">South China Morning Post</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/24/apple-joins-china-subsidy-program/">Apple Joins China Subsidy Program in Effort to Counter Declining Sales</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-joins-china-subsidy-program-in-effort-to-counter-declining-sales.2459610/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
