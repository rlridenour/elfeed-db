<p>I started my PhD program about a year ago. In my first year I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taken 4 &ldquo;normal&rdquo; 3-credit-hour classes</li>
<li>Participated in 3 seminars</li>
<li>Switched advisors</li>
<li>Attended 2 conferences (PLDI @ FCRC, JuliaCon)</li>
<li>Presented my work at JuliaCon</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a lot of work, and there&rsquo;s been a lot of stress. I&rsquo;m in a much better place now than when I started, and over all I&rsquo;m happy where I&rsquo;m at and where I&rsquo;m headed.</p>

<p>Some of the stress has come from finances: it&rsquo;s hard to support a family on a PhD stipend with rising costs of living.</p>
<p>The most stress I felt was in my first semester. I got hired on as an RA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> with a nice researcher and we hit it off well. But I discovered half way through the semester that I was not enjoying the work. This wasn&rsquo;t anyone&rsquo;s fault—I had to do a little bit of the work to find out that I wasn&rsquo;t that interested in what I was doing.</p>
<p>At first I thought that I might be able to power through. I didn&rsquo;t want to be the kind of student that hops from advisor to advisor or from project to project just as the going gets tough, boring, or unpleasant. But I talked with <a href="https://kimball.germane.net/">my advisor from undergrad</a>, and he explained that a PhD sets the tone of your research basically until you get tenure. That&rsquo;s a long time—and I didn&rsquo;t want to work in that area for a decade or better. I realized that I either had to change what I was working on, or I needed to quit and go back to industry.</p>
<p>I started looking around at what my options were. My school assigns every grad student a &ldquo;faculty mentor&rdquo;—a faculty member who is not your advisor that&rsquo;s &ldquo;assigned&rdquo; to you. In my experience, most professors are more than happy to talk to you if you need help—this one just happened to be assigned to me. At some point I discovered that <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/bgreenma/">Ben Greenman</a> was coming to the U as a professor. I called him, we talked, and we figured out that our interests were much more closely aligned. Problem was, Ben wasn&rsquo;t starting at the U until the fall. I found a fellowship for one semester, and was able to do work with Ben and another professor through the summer.</p>
<p>Finding an advisor whose interests aligned with mine was a <em>huge</em> improvement for my work and my mental health. If you are looking into going to grad school, I would make that your top priority. And it wasn&rsquo;t that my first advisor was <em>bad</em> in any way—we&rsquo;re still friends, we chat when we run into each other in the hall, and I learned a lot from him—it&rsquo;s just that our interests were less aligned than I originally thought, and it took a little time to discover that. Better sooner rather than later, though.</p>

  Reading papers
  <a class="anchor" href="#reading-papers">#</a>
</h2>
<p>One thing I noticed this week that made me really happy: reading research papers is a lot easier for me now. When I started getting interested in research back in my undergrad, I found reading papers to be <em>so</em> arduous. It took me a week or more to get through a single paper, and I never got a lot out of them. I felt like it was difficult for me to even understand the questions that the paper was trying to answer.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m more familiar with the context and the jargon, and I can grasp the questions the paper is trying to answer better. The format of research papers is familiar to me now, and that familiarity reduces the amount of friction I encounter when reading. It took time and exposure, and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a substitute for that. Reading papers and discussing them with my advisors was a big help too.</p>
<p>The paper <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf">How to Read a Paper</a> is probably the single most valuable bit of help an aspiring researcher can get. You should read it. (It&rsquo;s short: 2 pages)</p>

<p>Grad classes have a different tone than undergrad classes. As one of my professors put it, you will get an A or a B unless you persuade the professor that you should get a lower grade. This is nice because I have to keep a particular GPA to qualify for tuition benefit.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> That means I can do the minimum to learn the material and spend the majority of my time and energy on research.</p>
<p>After switching research projects, I noticed a switch in my priorities: my first semester, I would do my class work and then do research if I had time left over. My second semester, I did research first and class work happened when I had nothing else to do. I like the second balance better.</p>

  Conferences and speaking

<p>I got to present my work at JuliaCon 2023. I&rsquo;ll put up a link to the video when it comes out, but if you poke around <a href="https://juliacon.org/2023/">the recordings</a> you should be able to find the talk in the middle of a long recording.</p>
<p>It was fun to prepare and present our work at a conference. It was also a <em>ton</em> of effort. I have never put that much time and energy into preparing a talk as I did for that conference. And it turned out pretty well, if I do say so myself. Hopefully subsequent talks will be less stressful, less effort, <em>and</em> even higher-quality!</p>
<p>JuliaCon was hosted in Boston; before that I went to PLDI in Orlando. Boston is <em>far</em> superior to Orlando. Orlando is a wasteland of hotels and conference centers and has nothing walkable anywhere. In contrast, Boston is a vibrant city that is a delight to walk around with plenty of interesting things to see.</p>
<p>It has been satisfying getting to know people in the PL community. It&rsquo;s also been nice to work more closely with professors in my department. I&rsquo;m lucky I get to hang around with so many curious, intelligent, and friendly people.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy with where I am. The PhD program was hard at first—and it&rsquo;s still hard—but it&rsquo;s a different, more interesting kind of hard, and I like that.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll like the next few years. I still don&rsquo;t know if I want to go into industry for a few years after or find a post-doc position in academia. Long-term I want to be a professor. We&rsquo;ll see how it pans out though.</p>

<p>Research Assistant. At least where I attend, there are Research Assistants, Graduate Assistants, and Teaching Assistants. RAs have funding and get paid to do research. GAs either have some kind of fellowship (some kind of grant/fund/pool of money from the school rather than a research grant) or are paying their own way. TAs teach classes in exchange for tuition and stipend money.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
