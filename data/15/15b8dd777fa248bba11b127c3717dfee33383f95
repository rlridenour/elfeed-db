<p>European Union leaders met in Brussels for emergency talks after two weeks of tension triggered by President Donald Trump’s renewed threats to take control of Greenland and warnings of possible US tariffs on Europe. In the latest development, President Trump announced he was backing away from tariff threats tied to countries sending troops to Greenland, citing a “framework” with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, which eased immediate pressure but left questions about the details and Denmark’s sovereignty concerns. EU leaders said they still want transatlantic cooperation and a trade deal back on track, while also signaling they will defend EU interests if threatened again.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/hBLBDEM_URMfzqES7_JddEiMBRyNvIwSGlXszALz6Ue5kDb862mv6w4tf6yNGITU1-8d0wZ2dTrTK8xUSpyyz4wCNC85Y0uwEgbjF0GnuIOxegviC37r8Tw5l4wtt3gaHCGk36IRraDTcvgbtPiKil7siGBJLvw7bavwCsJC-w-nXlAlCS5qx9vuJP6NDcilwxhV7z5kBIgfZoaj1aedTHEtelpwCPydc8Fb' alt='Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary-general, meeting with President Trump in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>EU unity claim: Several EU diplomats and officials said the bloc’s rapid, coordinated and firm response—paired with readiness to counter US moves—helped drive President Trump’s Greenland about-turn.</li><li>Arctic security: EU officials discussed reinforcing Arctic security in the Danish-held territory, including steps such as sending troops, as part of their broader response to the Greenland tensions.</li><li>Trade stabilisation: EU leaders framed their immediate aim as “stabilisation” of US-EU trade relations after the crisis, alongside preparing defensive options if tariff threats return.</li><li>Europe’s dilemma: European leaders also debated how to respond to President Trump’s broader skepticism toward Europe and what that means for the future shape of transatlantic relations.</li></ul><blockquote>When Europe is not divided, when we stand together and when we are clear and strong, also in our willingness to stand up for ourselves, then the results will show - Mette Frederiksen</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Union leaders: EU leaders said they want to strengthen transatlantic cooperation and get trade talks back on track, while emphasizing the EU would defend itself against renewed pressure.
