<p>Nigerian authorities have sent troops to parts of Kwara state after gunmen attacked rural communities including the village of Woro. Residents and officials described civilians being shot, homes and shops set on fire, and people abducted. Casualty reports remain hard to verify. One account put the death toll at more than 160 as searches continued in hard-to-reach areas. The deployment reflects growing concern that violence linked to armed groups—long concentrated in Nigeria’s north-east and north-west—is spreading to other parts of the country, making it harder to protect remote communities and to confirm casualty figures.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wUw_R5v9onf4ih4sHKhNjSqEQN75ZM32Ll8KyNrNDYUTD81ty_JQpZagsQ3FeEKN4sqSO4E_-oZVYdG7wHHAxRmcRN1rbVgcDc_qB4wWkuDb_PX-C7cZu_zP555kVcOZROohonsEJUV02Z0HJWGSv7qUlwi56KYBRQQmiv2JfD2dumwwJsPMSNRepjM96MvvLIQV5Bn8S5FiDUarrvXtOHWBburMrxl-X5acAT43NzZlgFwHEdF43aMQ4t4y7F5T' alt='Security forces deploy after reported mass killings in Kwara state, Nigeria.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Burned alive: Survivors said attackers set buildings on fire, trapping some residents inside their homes.</li><li>Burials count: A village head told Premium Times that 75 victims had been buried, as communities continue the work of accounting for the dead.</li><li>Warning letter: Witnesses said the attackers sent a message saying they were coming to preach; when no one attended, they attacked.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Village chief Umar Bio Salihu: He said gunmen arrived around 5pm on Tuesday and “just came in and started shooting,” describing killings and abductions in his household.
