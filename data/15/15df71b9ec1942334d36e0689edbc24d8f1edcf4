<p>Mexican authorities say they have recovered 10 bodies while investigating the kidnapping of 10 workers taken last month from a mine linked to Canada-based Vizsla Silver Corp in Mexico’s northern state of Sinaloa. Prosecutors said they found the bodies in the municipality of Concordia. Five have been identified so far, and forensic teams are working to identify the other five. Vizsla Silver said family members told the company that some of the abducted workers had been found dead, as relatives wait for official identification and more details from authorities. The case has again focused attention on security risks in parts of northern Mexico, while investigators work to confirm identities and piece together what happened.</p><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Mexico’s attorney general’s office: Prosecutors said in a statement that they recovered bodies during a search linked to the mine-worker abductions, and that forensic identification is still underway.
