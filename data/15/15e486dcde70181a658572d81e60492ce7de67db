The NFC Forum announced <a href="https://nfc-forum.org/news/2025-10-nfc-forum-launches-certification-to-support-extended-range-of-contactless-connections/">NFC Certification Release 15 (CR15)</a>, introducing a change that boosts the potential read range of NFC devices. CR15 defines the certification program for compliance with the NFC Release 15 specification that was announced earlier this year.<br/>

CR15 allows devices to certify for a read range of up to 20mm, which is a meaningful improvement over the prior 5mm limit. The NFC Forum says that the range increase will improve the user experience by requiring less precise alignment for a connection.<br/>
<br/>
Future Apple Watch and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models could adopt the increased 20mm range, but existing devices won't benefit because the change requires updated NFC hardware.<br/>
<br/>
For &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch users, the update could allow future Apple devices to activate hotel room doors, house doors, car doors, and other NFC-enabled devices from further away. NFC is used for short-range interactions, like unlocking a HomeKit-compatible door as the homeowner approaches or opening a hotel room door without a physical key. Apple technologies like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> and hotel key wallet integration could be faster and more reliable with the change.<br/>
<br/>
The 15mm increase means users won't have to align devices as precisely, but NFC will still be more secure than longer-range technologies like Bluetooth or Ultra Wideband. Devices that support the 20mm certification could be available in the coming months now that the testing and certification process is available.<br/>

Apple, Google, and other major tech companies are members of the NFC Forum, so Apple was likely involved in the specification upgrade.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/nfc-certification-release-15/">Future iPhones Could Get Extended NFC Range for Easier Tap-to-Unlock</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/future-iphones-could-get-extended-nfc-range-for-easier-tap-to-unlock.2469639/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
