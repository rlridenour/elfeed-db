I really like Gnuplot. It can take a bit of raw data and produce a first class graph in many different formats. There are two problems:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It&rsquo;s command set is truly baroque and hard to learn</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t use it often enough to learn that baroque command language</li>
</ol>
<p>
That second problem means that whenever I want to use Gnuplot I have to spend time with its, admittedly excellent, manual. So it&rsquo;s a two edged sword. On the one hand I don&rsquo;t use it enough to learn the command set and on the other hand it&rsquo;s so painful to figure out how to do things that I avoid using it if I can.

Charles Choi feels my—or more likely his own—pain and has <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/a-proof-of-concept-to-put-a-better-emacs-ui-on-top-of-gnuplot.html">put together a prototype Casual app for Gnuplot</a>. He has a video of it in action and it seems really nice. Choi says, though, that it&rsquo;s far from complete and that it would probably take three or four months of full time effort to get it up to production level. That&rsquo;s a large commitment and he wonders if it would be worth the effort. In particular, he wants to hear from prospective users if it&rsquo;s something they&rsquo;d want and use.

So far, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1mzdibe/a_proof_of_concept_to_put_a_better_emacs_ui_on/">comments to his post</a> seem overwhelmingly positive. It appears that there&rsquo;s a real desire for something like this. You can make it happen in two ways. First leave a comment to his post or one of the places he&rsquo;s linked to expressing your interest in such an app. Second, consider supporting Choi&rsquo;s work. It can be as easy as simply <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/kickingvegas">buying him a cup of coffee</a>.
