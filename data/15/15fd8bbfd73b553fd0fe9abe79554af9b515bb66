Pebble <a href="https://repebble.com/blog/meet-pebble-index-01-external-memory-for-your-brain">today announced</a> the Pebble Index 01, a simple smart ring that's designed for recording information. It is equipped with a microphone and a button to start a recording, but little else.<br/>

Priced at &#36;75, the Index 01 does not require an internet connection or a subscription, and it doesn't record unless the button is pressed. Recordings are sent to a connected smartphone, and can be saved as a note, added to a calendar, or set as a reminder. Information is processed by open source speech-to-text and AI models locally on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or Android smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
It is customizable, and single or double button clicks can be set to control different actions like switching to a new song, taking a photo, or activating smart home devices.<br/>
<br/>
The device is made from stainless steel, and it is available in three colors, including silver, gold, and black. Sizes range from 6 to 13. It is resistant to water, and no charging is necessary. Pebble says the battery will last for 12 to 15 hours of recording, which equates to 10-20 recordings per day that are 3-6 seconds in length. Since there is no replaceable battery and no option to charge, the ring is meant to be recycled when the battery dies.<br/>
