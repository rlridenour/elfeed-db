<p>In the latest development in the Gaza conflict, Israel has agreed to a tightly controlled, partial reopening of the Rafah crossing with Egypt after it had been largely shut since Israeli forces took control of the Gaza side in May 2024. Under the current arrangement, a daily quota allows up to 150 people to leave Gaza for Egypt and up to 50 to enter, mainly for medical evacuations and family reunifications, though actual numbers on the first day were far lower. On Monday, only a small group of Palestinians managed to cross in each direction, including about a dozen people returning to Gaza and a similar number of injured residents allowed out for treatment, illustrating the gap between formal quotas and on-the-ground approvals. Returnees described emotional reunions with relatives waiting in southern Gaza but also reported long waits, blindfolding, handcuffing and intense questioning in an Israeli-controlled buffer zone between the Egyptian side and Gaza, which some women characterized as humiliating and frightening. The reopening is part of the second phase of President Trump’s truce plan for Gaza, pushed by the United Nations and aid groups to ease a dire humanitarian situation after nearly two years of war, even as Israeli airstrikes continue in parts of the territory.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/zkbPBvNJFGr1GOKyDh3QUZqnxLcNAdT0i0uu8dn-33Zz91FmBhLjBOjfETyM1sRyW7999fW6DUGb52CM4yDAR-h6WqrUHZ903Y36oHR6U4SkOuIFJPXLGKYJ1Led7Pm41MIfe6bvmYHG1227pMTJ40JEqW1nwXjC8m6HyD3VnCpG7uMzWWGnz7LpOklWwrWiS29G4I9roYs' alt='Palestinians embrace relatives returning to Gaza after the Rafah crossing partially reopened.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Quotas versus reality: Although the agreed framework envisions daily passage for up to 150 departures from Gaza and 50 entries into the enclave, diplomatic and border sources reported that only around a dozen people crossed each way on the first day, highlighting tighter Israeli vetting than the headline numbers suggest.</li><li>Focus on medical cases: Egyptian officials said the initial group allowed out of Gaza included a handful of wounded Palestinians, each permitted to travel with up to two companions, with patients triaged on arrival and distributed among prepared Egyptian hospitals.</li><li>Egypt’s health preparations: Egypt’s health ministry readied about 150 hospitals, 300 ambulances, 12,000 doctors and 30 rapid deployment teams to receive Gaza patients transferred through Rafah under the new arrangement, according to Egyptian media cited by AFP.</li><li>Buffer zone controls: Palestinians returning from Egypt described passing through a &quot;yellow line&quot; zone controlled by Israeli forces and an allied Palestinian armed group, where they say they were interrogated and had items such as toys and personal gifts confiscated before reaching Gaza.</li><li>Symbolic return home: Some of the first Gazans allowed back after nearly two years abroad told reporters that even a small number of returnees symbolically counters the idea that residents will be permanently displaced from the enclave.</li></ul><blockquote>For the first time in years, we felt like human beings. - Um Mohammed, Palestinian returnee to Gaza</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Palestinian returnees: Women and children who crossed back into Gaza said they endured hours of waiting, were blindfolded and handcuffed during questioning, and had personal items confiscated before finally reaching their families.
