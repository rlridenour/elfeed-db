<p>In <a href="https://archive.org/details/McGillLibrary-mcgill-daily-v28-n093-march-13-1939-8849/mode/2up">March 1939</a>, students at McGill University dictated this sentence to a dozen faculty members:</p>
<p><em>Outside a cemetery sat a harassed cobbler and an embarrassed oculist, picknicking on a desiccated apple, and gazing at the symmetry of a lady&#8217;s ankle with unparalleled ecstasy.</em></p>
<p>The participants included three English professors, the head of the journalism department, and a proofreading instructor.</p>
<p>Only Esther Korstad, instructor of typewriting and shorthand, spelled everything correctly. The average participant misspelled 4.25 words.</p>
