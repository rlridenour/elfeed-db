AT&T's website references an unreleased iPad Pro model with an M5 chip, but it is unclear if it is an accidental leak, or simply a premature SEO play.<br/>

Here is how the HTML title for the <a href="https://www.att.com/buy/tablets/browse/apple/">iPad page on AT&T's website</a> appears in Google search results:<blockquote>Shop Apple iPad Tablets: iPad Pro M5 Pre-Order Soon</blockquote>Here is a screenshot of the Google result:<br/>

There are no product listings for an iPad Pro with an M5 chip on AT&T's online store, so this is ultimately not a substantial discovery. However, in line with rumors, it could signal that Apple is set to announce the next iPad Pro models soon.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to update the iPad Pro with an M5 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/05/next-ipad-pro-two-key-upgrades/">as early as this month</a>, and the entire device already leaked in two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/30/ipad-pro-with-m5-chip-unboxing-video-leak/">early unboxing videos</a> out of Russia. It was also rumored that the device would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">equipped with two front cameras</a>, but there was no visible evidence of this change in the unboxing videos, so we shall see.<br/>

Last year, the iPad Pro was updated with an OLED display and a thinner design, but no major design changes are expected for the next models. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/11/att-website-references-next-generation-ipad-pro-with-m5-chip/">AT&amp;T Website References Next-Generation iPad Pro With M5 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/at-t-website-references-next-generation-ipad-pro-with-m5-chip.2468958/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
