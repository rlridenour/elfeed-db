<p>If I have a superpower, it&#8217;s probably this: I&#8217;m immune to social media.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been years since I&#8217;ve used Twitter or any Twitter-like app. I&#8217;ve never gotten hooked. Never felt that pull to scroll. Never lost hours to the feed.</p>



<p>Until last month.</p>



<p>I decided to give Instagram a real shot. Just to see what all the fuss was about. I figured maybe I&#8217;d been missing something.</p>



<p>The algorithm was terrifyingly good. Within 30 minutes, my feed was perfectly curated: intricate woodworking joinery, bonsai care techniques, people tying complex knots, and yes, cute puppies. It was like Instagram had crawled inside my brain and said, &#8220;We got you.&#8221;</p>



<p>For about a week, I found myself reaching for my phone in the evening. Just a little scrolling. Nothing serious. But it became part of the routine.</p>



<p>Then something shifted.</p>



<p>All the knots started looking the same. The joinery techniques blurred together. Even the puppies felt repetitive. And I caught myself watching someone else tend to their bonsai trees while mine sat on the bench outside, waiting for attention.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s when it clicked. I&#8217;d rather be doing these things than watching other people do them.</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I grew up without this stuff. My brain didn&#8217;t get wired for infinite scroll during those critical years. Or maybe I just prefer the smell of sawdust to the glow of a screen.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason, the spell broke. I got back to my actual hobbies.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what surprised me most: the algorithm got my interests right, but it couldn&#8217;t account for the fact that I&#8217;m happiest when I&#8217;m making things, not consuming content about making things.</p>



<p>Social media companies have spent billions figuring out how to keep us engaged. They&#8217;re incredibly good at it. But they can&#8217;t replicate the satisfaction of actually doing the work.</p>



<p>If you find yourself scrolling through content about your hobbies more than you&#8217;re actually doing them, maybe try this: spend one evening doing the thing instead of watching other people do it. See which one feels better.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m betting on the doing.</p>
