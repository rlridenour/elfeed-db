<p>President Trump has launched a proposed US-led “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza’s postwar transition, reconstruction and governance, with invitations sent to a growing list of countries. A draft charter reported by multiple outlets says countries can secure permanent membership by contributing at least $1 billion in cash within the first year; otherwise, membership terms are limited to three years and renewals depend on the chairman. Officials in several countries—including Pakistan and Kazakhstan—say they have received invitations, while Russia’s Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin was also invited. Supporters frame the initiative as a new mechanism to sustain a ceasefire and fund rebuilding, while some European officials have expressed limited appetite for financing a body they view as advancing a Trump-led world order, according to reporting cited in one account.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gZM0lfTQgPSReXHkV1gAZOwxX80_sKg11St-d6c0wHefprv4ZE8sSw7Rk5LlSd2QeMpzjYLVkL7ecbyDmI-OOW2qE4pi66wRTxzP4uWU6DMNR-YHlO0VsM1fFWoEFOdBmF6jN3Spqe8j6O2C6O7aakjMN4GRb25Or9gYtGbJvA' alt='Image used with ABC News coverage of invitations to Trump’s Gaza “Board of Peace.”' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Leadership structure: A Reuters-cited letter and draft charter say the board would be chaired for life by President Trump and would start with Gaza before expanding to other conflicts.</li><li>Kazakh acceptance: Kazakhstan’s spokesperson said President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev accepted the invitation and wants to help pursue a stable Middle East peace.</li><li>India outreach: RT reported that the US ambassador to India posted a letter on X from President Trump inviting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to participate.</li><li>Founding names: RT said the founding executive board includes US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former UK prime minister Tony Blair, with President Trump as chair.</li><li>UN-rival talk: TIME reported that some observers speculate the board could become a US-led rival to the United Nations, and cited a senior European official describing limited enthusiasm for major funding.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House/US plan backers: The initiative is presented as a US-led body to oversee Gaza’s transition, reconstruction and security as part of next steps after the war and ceasefire planning.
