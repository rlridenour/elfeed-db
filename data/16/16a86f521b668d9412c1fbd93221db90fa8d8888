<h3>iPhone 18 Pro Leak: Smaller Dynamic Island, No Top-Left Camera Cutout</h3><br/>
Over the last few months, rumors around the iPhone 18 Pro's front-panel design have been conflicted, with some supply chain leaks pointing to under-display Face ID, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/19/iphone-18-pro-dynamic-island-top-left-corner/">reports suggesting a top-left hole-punch camera</a>, and debate over whether the familiar Dynamic Island will shrink, shift, or disappear entirely.<br/>

According to frequent Weibo-based leaker Instant Digital, however, early reports from Chinese and Korean sources about the possible relocation of an infrared Face ID component were later mistranslated in some English-language coverage, leading to incorrect claims of a hole-punch camera. In fact, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/iphone-18-pro-leak-smaller-dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island will remain on the iPhone 18 Pro</a> and simply be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/iphone-18-pro-alleged-dynamic-island-size/">roughly 35% narrower</a>. That smaller Dynamic Island interpretation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/latest-iphone-18-pro-leak-corroborated/">has also been corroborated</a> by respected display analyst Ross Young.<br/>

<h3>A Siri Chatbot is Coming in iOS 27</h3><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/siri-chatbot-ios-27/">plans to turn Siri into a chatbot that will rival Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, and OpenAI's ChatGPT</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported this week.

<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri-chatbot/">chatbot version of Siri arriving in iOS 27</a> later this year will follow the initial upgrade to a more personalized version of the current Siri that we expect to arrive in just a few months with iOS 26.4.<br/>

There is a standard lens and a wide-angle lens that are meant to capture photos and videos, while three microphones are designed to pick up sound around the wearer. An included speaker allows the pin to play audio, and there is a physical control button along one edge. The device is able to wirelessly charge like an Apple Watch.<br/>

<h3>iPhone 18 Rumored to Feature Much Brighter Display</h3><br/>
Apple's iPhone 18 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/iphone-18-rumored-to-feature-much-brighter-display/">will feature a significantly brighter display</a>, according to a Chinese leaker.<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-ceramic-shield.jpg" alt="" width="1950" height="1097" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018134" /><br/>
In a post this week on Weibo, the user known as Instant Digital said that Chinese supplier BOE has little hope of making panels for the ‌iPhone 18‌ because Apple's brightness requirements for the next-generation device are unprecedentedly high. This suggests that the ‌iPhone 18‌'s display will see a considerable leap forward in terms of brightness.<br/>
<br/>
While the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max are expected to launch in the usual September time frame, the regular iPhone 18‌ isn't expected to launch until early 2027.<br/>
