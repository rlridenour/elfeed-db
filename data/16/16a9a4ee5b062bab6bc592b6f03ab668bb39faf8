<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Pining for a little more winter; or at least some nights of solitude in which thoughts flow freely.
</p>
        <p>One of my favorite feeds is that of <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/">The Marginalian</a>.  <time datetime="2025-03-03" title="2025-03-03">Earlier this month</time>,
<a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/03/03/kafka-insomnia/">Insomnia and the Secret Life of Ideas: Kafka on the Relationship Between
Sleeplessness and Creativity</a> rolled through my feed.</p>
<p>I think about this fading winter, when I would wake during the middle of the
night.  When there was enough dark to sleep, wake amongst the solitude, then
sleep again.</p>
<p>Over beers, <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon">Brandon</a> and I shared some magnificent passages around wee early
mornings.  He shared a passage from <cite data-id="24184133-1797-4eb2-b326-44e987d8ab8b">The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</cite> by John le Carré regarding early morning airports.  And I shared a moment of venerable
King Arthur amongst the hills and fens in <cite data-id="DF694105-1DA3-40C9-9F63-EE9BB0E89D8C">The Book of Merlyn</cite> by T.H. White.</p>
<p>This dark of night, a time after one has set about sleeping yet before one has
committed to set about one’s day; a day still many hours distant.  <del>Here</del> Now/then
in this unclaimed <del>space</del> time, thoughts bleed as an unbound wound, spilling as
ink to paper.</p>
<p>And with that inky black night passing across an incandescent mind, the mark of
consciousness burns bright.</p>
<p>Here just shy of the 42nd parallel, winter nights are long.<small class="side-container">

 And as we
tick-tock towards the equinox, the days gain mass faster and faster.  Slowing
once tip into spring, yet still stretching until the solstice.</p>
<p>I’ll miss those dark moments of aloneness, yet find comfort knowing they await
again after another trip around the sun.</p>
<p>Between the wintry changing of the clocks, as futile an effort of saving
daylight as that of saving souls, I know my words flow more freely.</p>

<p>The four months of November, December, January, February: 435 posts; these stand
as a proxy of the time change.  And the remaining eight months 666.  Which would
be 333 posts per 4 month.</p>
<p>Those dark hours are where my thoughts flourish and flow.  It is the hours of
myth making and story telling.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-03-10" title="2025-03-10">Today</time> as sunshine beats upon the melting ice of our neighboring lake, I think of
a desire of mine.  To spend a few weeks above the arctic circle; to live without
daylight.  What might that extreme tease from my soul?</p>
<p>Yet that is not this season, for upon us now is bursting blossoms.</p>
