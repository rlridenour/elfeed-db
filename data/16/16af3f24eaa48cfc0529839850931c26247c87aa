In iOS 26, Apple Music introduces playlist folders, bringing the same organizational power that's long been available for photos and notes to your music collection. Whether you're juggling workout mixes, seasonal soundtracks, or genre-specific selections, folders should be a welcome management tool for your most favored collections.<br/>

The feature works exactly as you'd expect – simply create the folder, rename it to suit the intended content, and you'll be navigating your music library with newfound efficiency in no time. You can even nest playlist folders by mood, activity, artist, or whatever system that makes sense for how you actually listen to music.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Create a New Folder</h2><br/>
Here's how to create a playlist folder in the Music app:<br/>
<ol><li>In the Playlist section, tap the <strong>+</strong> icon at the top. </li><br/>
<li>Choose <strong>New Folder...</strong> from the popup menu.</li><br/>
<li>Give your new folder a name, then tap <strong>Create</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/music-playlist-folders-ios1.jpg" alt="music" width="4197" height="2736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013768" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Move Playlists into a Folder</h2><br/>
With your folder created, move in some playlists like so:<br/>
<ol><li>Long press on a playlist.</li><br/>
<li>Choose <strong>Move to...</strong> from the popup menu.</li><br/>
<li>Select the folder from All Playlists.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the red <strong>Move</strong> button.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/music-playlist-folders-ios2.jpg" alt="music" width="4197" height="2736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1013769" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. Finally, iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 bring a little more feature parity with the Music app on Mac.<br/>
