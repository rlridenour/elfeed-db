<p>President Trump announced he was withdrawing his endorsement of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene after she publicly criticized his efforts to limit release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and joined a small group of Republicans pushing to force a vote on the files. Greene says the President is &quot;making an example&quot; of her to deter other Republicans ahead of that vote; Trump said he would back a primary challenger &quot;if the right person runs,&quot; signaling a public split within the MAGA-aligned wing of the GOP. Major news outlets and social platforms carried immediate coverage, framing the move as a notable break between a former staunch ally and the White House.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ihSTkrUMRI7yW7MHGfeBILXC0bSoGb55l5u8mIXxPNgvON9vFjG_HJfugHzrluOxT3TIW4R4GPmL7HqmVkV1p7wgqFu3mqQIkxbMDeym7qDzcGsQBknLIk2t_znX747f4tNrjae_UduTLx9eJhse0plFaxb22c9yQbqQu8SQ9uxj7A' alt='President Trump at a public appearance; media outlets used similar photos while reporting on his withdrawal of support for Rep.
