<h3 id="my-karma-ran-over-my-dogma">My karma ran over my dogma</h3>
<p>Here is your periodic reminder to be open to using the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Don’t be dogmatic about plain text, minimalism, trying to get people to push their chairs in after leaving the table. Leave some room for the unexpected.</p>
<p><em>Do</em> be dogmatic about protecting your hard work, and keeping proprietary apps as your playground, not your permanent residence.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/126-dash-plus-system-in-obtf-and-analog-notes">Dash-Plus system part 1</a></em> · <em><a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/129-live-out-of-your-notes-dash-plus-dot-points">part 2</a></em></p>
<p>My paper notebook is the analog equivalent of my digital <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/091-obtf-obsidian-bullet-journal">One Big Text File</a>, but I’ve come to realise that each medium lends itself to a different way of categorising notes.</p>
<p>For notes made on paper, Dash-Plus is the clear winner. Check out parts 1 and 2 above to see how I’m using it.</p>
<p>For notes made in my <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span>, neither Dash-Plus nor the Bullet Journal method have worked for me. It was easy to come up with symbols that mimic BuJo or Dash-Plus systems, but my brain rejected them as not memorable enough, too forced, too complicated.</p>
<p>Next step: use these wonderful systems to inform my approach, not dictate it.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s working:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Define the categories that notes will fit into, making them broad enough that <em>every</em> note falls easily into one of them</li>
<li>Give each category a name that is easy to remember and which starts with a different letter of the alphabet (you could also use a trigram)</li>
<li>Use this letter to categorise your notes, adding a common keyboard symbol to the start to make it easily searchable</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s what mine look like today. It’s the <code>Key</code> from the top of my <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span>.</p>

<!-- Black monotype text on a white background. It’s a list of items with sub-items indented. Each new line begins with a forward slash, a lower case letter, and a period. Next comes a date in YYYY-MM-DD format, and finally the text of the note. -->
<p>Yes, tags would also work, and would be quick to enter with auto-complete. At the moment I like using letters followed by a period because they’re easy for me to remember, and because ending with a period means the next word will start with a capital — convenient when typing on my phone. If/when I change my mind about which symbols to use, find and replace makes it easy to switch.</p>
<p>Do what works for your brain! I’d love to see what you come up with.</p>
