<p>My thanks to <a href="https://bzgapps.com/coherence">Coherence X5</a> for sponsoring Six Colors this week.</p>
<p>Turning websites into Mac apps isn’t a new idea, but for years it’s come with tradeoffs. Safari web apps are limited. Electron apps are heavy. And most “site-specific browser” tools stop short of feeling truly native.</p>
<p>Coherence X5 takes a different approach. It’s a Chrome-based app builder for macOS that turns any website into a clean, isolated Mac app—all while keeping the full power of Chrome extensions, profiles, and modern web compatibility. It supports Chrome, Brave, Edge, Chromium, and even Ungoogled Chromium, giving you flexibility without lock-in.</p>
<p>What makes Coherence X5 special is how native it feels. With a redesigned creation tool built for macOS 26 and Liquid Glass, creating apps is fast and intuitive. And the all-new Coherence Extension brings real Mac behavior to Chrome-powered apps: restoring windows from the Dock, intelligently blocking rogue popups, forwarding links to your default browser when appropriate, and remembering where you left off between launches.</p>
<p>If you want the flexibility of the modern web – without living in browser tabs or slow electron apps – Coherence X5 turns websites into Mac apps that finally feel like they belong on macOS.</p>
