  <p>When it comes to Apple’s biggest films, <em>F1: The Movie</em> has
officially moved to pole position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will allow this pun.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>F1</em> has generated $293 million at the global box office after 10
days of release, overtaking the entire theatrical runs of Martin
Scorsese’s <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> ($158 million worldwide)
and Ridley Scott’s <em>Napoleon</em> ($221 million) to stand as Apple’s
highest-grossing movie to date. That’s not a particularly
difficult benchmark to break, since Apple has only released five
films theatrically and two of them, <em>Fly Me to the Moon</em> ($42
million) and <em>Argylle</em> ($96 million), were outright flops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to mention that <em>Wolfs</em>, last year’s crime caper starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, was <em>supposed</em> to get a theatrical release but didn’t, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/03/more-wolfs">leading to bad feelings</a> and, later, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/wolfs-sequel-demise-jon-watts-george-clooney-brad-pitt-no-longer-trusted-apple-1236186227/">a cancelled sequel</a>. <em>Wolfs</em> wasn’t bad. I’d say it was decent. <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wolfs/">Critics seem to agree</a>. But with Clooney and Pitt starring and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wolfs/">Watts</a> at the helm, it felt like a movie that should have at least been pretty damn good. And it wasn’t.</p>

<p>So it’s not just that <em>F1: The Movie</em> is doing well at the box office. It’s seemingly a good movie that delivers what it promises.</p>
