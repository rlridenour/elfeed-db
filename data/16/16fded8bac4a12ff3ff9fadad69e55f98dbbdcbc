<p>My thanks to WorkOS for sponsoring last week at DF to promote their summer launch week. You may recall their previous launch week <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/workos-launch-week">back in spring</a>, when I emphasized that their launch week announcements were worth checking out just to admire the retro-modern design of the web page. Well, they’ve done it again, with all-new retro pixel-art design. It’s so fun and well done, with a bunch of UI elements that you can play with.</p>

<p>Amidst the fun of the presentation, they once again have a slew of great new features, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://workos.com/blog/authkit-custom-css">Custom CSS for AuthKit</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://workos.com/blog/feature-flags">Feature Flags</a> — “Assign flags, expose them in JWTs, and roll out features with targeted control.”</li>
<li><a href="https://workos.com/blog/supabase-integration">Supabase Native Auth Integration</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://workos.com/blog/cli-auth">CLI Auth</a> — “Log in from the command line with OAuth 2.0 device grant flow”.</li>
</ul>
