<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A childhood of sand lots and #baseball makes way for a reflection on a recent &ldquo;About the Author&rdquo; section I just read.  And then a #poem.
</p>
        <p>I picked up <cite data-id="8dd61ce0-3f3c-4faf-bcca-2925477484ac">Rebel Poet</cite> by Louis V. Clark III (Two Shoes).  And the closing sentence about the author caught my
attention: “he leans on his baseball background and &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t go down looking.&rsquo;”</p>
<p>I grew up playing baseball; a game in which you can’t run out the clock, though
the modern pitching clock does require sustained action.</p>
<p>In the early 80s, I lived near a sand lot.  In that neighborhood there were at
least 20 boys between the ages of 7 and 12.  And one man who was on disability
for a busted back.  That man, and his two sons, took it upon themselves to turn
that sandlot into a baseball diamond.</p>
<p>For a few summers, we all played neighborhood baseball during the days.  And
then in the evening played for our little league teams.  I don’t recall being a
good batter, but I was good at knowing where the ball would go.  This meant
early on I was at first base.</p>
<p>First base is where all the action happens.  And there are rules around that
base that highlight how important gaining a toe hold with a base runner can be.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to reading Louis v. Clark III (Two Shoes)’s poetry, but
figured I’d add something of my own before diving into his.</p>
<p>Thank you Two Shoes for lobbing this one right over the plate.</p>
<h2 id="go-down-swinging">Go Down Swinging?</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p>Coach said “never go down looking,”<br />
But I was raised a pacifist,<br />
So going down swinging,<br />
Don’t make no sense.<br />
<br />
Fastballs keep getting faster,<br />
And those curves and cutters,<br />
Can’t catch a break.<br />
<br />
At the plate, so alone,<br />
Even amongst the yelling.<br />
<br />
Who’s the home team?<br />
Top or bottom?<br />
What’s the count?<br />
Who’s in or out?<br />
Someone’s kept the score,<br />
but not me.<br />
<br />
Check that swing,<br />
foul tip…hell of a cutter,<br />
still alive.  No blood.<br />
<br />
If there were a base-runner,<br />
and an out or two to spare,<br />
Then maybe a sacrifice.<br />
Advance the runner,<br />
One step closer to home.<br />
<br />
Here’s the pitch.<br />
<br />
Incoming | Hand slides out<br />
Spinning | Body shifts<br />
Dropping | Barrel level<br />
     (crack)<br />
<br />
Run<br /></p>
