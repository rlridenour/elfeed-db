<p>Presidents Félix Tshisekedi of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Paul Kagame of Rwanda signed the Washington Accords in the US capital, a peace agreement brokered by President Trump after more than eight months of negotiations aimed at ending conflict in eastern Congo and normalizing relations between the neighbors. The deal builds on a US-mediated understanding reached in June and an economic integration compact agreed in November, and includes commitments on security cooperation, withdrawal of support for armed groups, and frameworks for exploiting critical minerals with American participation. Trump hosted the ceremony at the recently renamed Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington and portrayed the signing as a &quot;great day for Africa&quot; and a step toward greater US investment and purchases of rare earths and other minerals from both countries. However, reports from eastern DR Congo describe ongoing clashes involving Rwanda-backed M23 rebels and other militias, and several analysts and local actors question whether the accord can quickly change the situation on the ground despite its hopeful language.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RJp9zp6KMg7aZ3se2myO_lC0CVVWsq6c8uEJqcNV3E6n1NCwthNAfVbJV_FkrWnGRmjfK-II1oMEvkBSAW8WC9wdDlpOuMzcSDPJpC5gAr-ZuvLRGgxezxSPXFOmw8CfVSsVbMN-rDF_nX3NQpc7K3i91E3s49ihDgvPq8XsJL9jvVIR52BgIyaZL-NRtxL9iyxk6fb3oUsgh4mqnk8i1zTU2Ik7vvegAsuY11HhOW_nOL7JQVcOjRQG4T4Gyg2MiEAanu06efcCqk-EtA' alt='President Donald Trump arrives for the Washington signing ceremony with Rwanda&#x27;s President Paul Kagame and DR Congo President Félix Tshisekedi at the Donald J.
