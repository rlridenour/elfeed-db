In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-02/apple-s-nearly-140-billion-quarter-when-ios-26-1-will-be-out-ipad-mini-revamp-mhhpy1ax">"Power On" newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> today provided an update on the status of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> and the plans for it in 2026.<br/>

Apple is still planning to roll out its revamped version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> around March of next year. The release should be accompanied by the release of a new smart home display product with speaker-base and wall-mount options. A new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, which are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/02/new-apple-tv-and-homepod-mini-launching-soon/">set for launch soon</a>, will also "help showcase" next year's new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features.<br/>
<br/>
The new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will apparently "lean" on Google's Gemini and include an AI-powered web search feature. Gurman warned "there's no guarantee users will embrace it, that it will work seamlessly or that it can undo years of damage to the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; brand."<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be paying Google to create a custom Gemini-based model that can run on its Private Cloud Compute servers to power &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. Gurman clarified that this doesn't mean &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will include Google services or Gemini features. Instead, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will simply be powered by a Gemini model in the background, enabling it to deliver the features that users expect with an Apple user interface.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will preview iOS 27, macOS 27, watchOS 27 and other operating systems at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The updates will apparently focus on major updates to &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; and the company's broader AI strategy.<br/>
<br/>
The company is also apparently still running into problems with the launch of &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; in China. Despite partnerships with Chinese companies, &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; in China is still mired by regulatory issues and the launch is now a "rolling target."<br/>
