<p>These are philosophers who were selected to take part in one of three funded summer programs&#8212;one on essay writing, one on trade books, and one on podcasting&#8212;that aim to &#8220;increase the presence of philosophy in print, audio, and video media by training philosophers to write and produce for the public, and by connecting philosophers to editors and commissioners in the media industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program is directed by <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/barryl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barry Lam</a> (UC Riverside, Hi-Phi Nation), and its faculty include writers and editors  of <em>The New Yorker</em> and <em>The New York Times</em>, editors from Viking Books and W.W. Norton, hosts and producers of successful podcasts, and others.</p>
