<p>In 1943 Buckminster Fuller announced that he&#8217;d been getting by on two hours of sleep a day. Each person has a primary and a secondary store of energy, he said; the first is restored quickly and the second takes longer. The trick, then, is to relax as soon as you&#8217;ve used up the primary store. Fuller trained himself to take a nap at the first sign of fatigue, which he found happened about every six hours. Taking a half-hour nap at those times left him in &#8220;the most vigorous and alert condition I have ever enjoyed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For two years Fuller thus averaged two hours of sleep in 24,&#8221; <a href="https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,774680,00.html"><em>Time</em> reported</a>, adding, &#8220;Life-insurance doctors who examined him found him sound as a nut.&#8221; Fuller said he&#8217;d had to abandon the plan because it conflicted with his coworkers&#8217; schedules. &#8220;But he wishes the nation&#8217;s &#8216;key thinkers&#8217; could adopt his schedule; he is convinced it would shorten the war.&#8221;</p>
