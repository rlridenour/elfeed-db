<p>The U.S. military says it carried out a strike in northwest Syria on Friday that killed Bilal Hasan al-Jasim, described by U.S. Central Command as an al-Qaeda-affiliated leader who plotted attacks. U.S. officials said he was directly connected to the Islamic State member blamed for a December ambush that killed two U.S. soldiers and an American civilian interpreter in Syria. The strike was presented as the third round of U.S. retaliatory action tied to that December attack.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/t8W_mspkX2p13idstUDQ0UivTuEiuXgU68WnsJ00El6Ixdt5WlbzB85I7tIszrf5N4C7SOmPrVYBOt90e6GDAYSae4c-HS22SggcOqsTinOnXYcJNexmNh7SwO26w1-0g_swMkBT4KI9w5Cigz8zOGr57-9R68eEN4lmrGD5fTjpCGS8BTQp_2m9XsHiXPqpOfnOmJWyPgqd6-YWUvkSKxsH_28dh8ukx5y0eQpB3pNTE57PzzbGGl_HElVFVmNvE11A2mAGBsM9CYH6qQ' alt='A U.S. military vehicle from the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State in Deir Hafer, Syria, on Friday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Operation name: Firstpost reported the U.S. described the action as “Operation Hawkeye” and linked it to the Palmyra-area attack referenced in U.S. statements.</li><li>Command attribution: CENTCOM said U.S. military forces conducted the strike and framed it as part of efforts to disrupt future militant plotting.</li><li>Victims identified: The Globe and Mail named the Americans killed in the Dec. 13 ambush as Sgt.
