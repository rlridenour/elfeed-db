<p>The decision is owed to &#8220;budget constraints&#8221; and was directed by the College of Arts &amp; Sciences at Georgetown.</p>
<p>It is expected that admissions will resume for fall of 2027.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://thehoya.com/news/gu-philosophy-department-halts-ph-d-admissions-amid-budget-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hoya</a> </em>reports:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The department announced the decision in a Dec. 22 email to applicants, one week after the Dec. 15 application deadline. The announcement came after university officials announced Dec. 12 that Georgetown has <a href="https://thehoya.com/news/gu-addresses-research-admission-concerns-enrollment-drops/" data-google-interstitial="false">reduced</a> doctoral enrollment amid ongoing <a href="https://thehoya.com/news/gu-will-continue-hiring-freeze-budget-cuts-groves-says/" data-google-interstitial="false">budget cuts</a> and a <a href="https://thehoya.com/news/gu-faces-decline-in-graduate-tuition-revenue-applications/" data-google-interstitial="false">decline</a> in graduate tuition revenue&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Interim University President Robert M. Groves announced Dec. 9 that the university recorded a 23% <a href="https://thehoya.com/news/gu-will-continue-hiring-freeze-budget-cuts-groves-says/" data-google-interstitial="false">decline</a> in the number of students starting graduate applications and a 20% <a href="https://thehoya.com/news/gu-faces-decline-in-graduate-tuition-revenue-applications/" data-google-interstitial="false">drop</a> in international graduate student enrollment. Groves <a href="https://thehoya.com/news/gu-faces-decline-in-graduate-tuition-revenue-applications/" data-google-interstitial="false">has cited</a> federal <a href="https://thehoya.com/news/gu-leaders-announce-plans-to-mitigate-executive-orders-impacts/" data-google-interstitial="false">cuts</a> to higher education funding, <a href="https://thehoya.com/news/news-top/gu-recommends-incoming-students-from-banned-countries-defer-enrollment-warns-current-students-not-to-leave-us/" data-google-interstitial="false">changing immigration policies</a> and <a href="https://thehoya.com/news/gu-students-denounce-federal-education-cuts/" data-google-interstitial="false">ending</a> graduate loan programs as reasons for the declines.</em></p>
<p>In an email to applicants breaking the news, John Greco, the department’s director of graduate admissions, wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I sincerely apologize for the late timing of this decision, which I understand is extremely frustrating for many reasons, not least because of the time and effort that goes into building a graduate admissions application. For different reasons, this is all deeply frustrating for the Admissions Committee and the Philosophy Department as well. That said, I do believe that Georgetown’s administration is acting with good will to negotiate difficult circumstances.</em></p>
<p>Georgetown is not the first philosophy graduate program to announce it was cutting back on admissions for the next year. <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/10/22/harvard-cuts-phd-admissions/">Harvard</a> is temporarily reducing the size of its incoming class. <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/09/15/philosophy-grad-programs-are-accepting-fewer-or-no-applications-for-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rutgers</a> is not accepting any applicants. Others are listed on <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/10/27/philosophy-grad-program-application-info-spreadsheet-2025-26-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this spreadsheet</a>.</p>
<p>(Reportedly, the Department of Philosophy is not the only department at Georgetown whose graduate admissions will be affected by the budget cuts, but I have not seen official news about that.)</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/12/24/georgetown-philosophy-suspends-phd-admissions-for-fall-2026/">Georgetown Philosophy Suspends PhD Admissions for Fall 2026</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
