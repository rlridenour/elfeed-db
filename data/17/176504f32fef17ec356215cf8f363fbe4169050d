<p id="p2">A week ago, we <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/welcome-to-the-new-unified-macstories-and-club-macstories/" rel="noopener noreferrer">merged</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/club/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Club MacStories</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/podcasts/appstories-plus/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStories</a> into <a href="https://www.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacStories.net</a>. It was the culmination of months of work, which, along with a new tech stack we implemented last summer, allows us to iterate on MacStories faster.</p>
<p id="p3">As with any large project, there were a few bumps along the way. However, we’ve been able to address them quickly thanks to the site’s new architecture. In fact, since last week, we’ve:</p>
<ul id="ul4"><li>significantly improved the load times of the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/club/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Club MacStories landing page</a>;</li>
<li>restored Discord access for Club members who have joined since the launch;</li>
<li>added <a href="https://www.macstories.net/my-feeds/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a MacStories-only feed for Club members</a> who want to separate free content from Club content;</li>
<li>reimplemented JSON feed support;</li>
<li>enhanced <a href="https://www.macstories.net/podcasts/appstories-plus/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the AppStories+ RSS feed</a> to better differentiate it from the free, ad-supported version of the show;</li>
<li>updated the Club RSS feeds to work with Readwise Reader;</li>
<li>added new category pages for Club members where they can access Federico’s Automation Academy column and my Mac Hacks column;</li>
<li>removed ads from Club-only content;</li>
<li>updated FAQs, author pages, and other pages across MacStories;</li>
<li>eliminated visual glitches, restored missing content, and fixed broken links across the site;</li>
<li>improved the layout of Club newsletters published on MacStories; </li>
<li>resolved caching and URL redirect issues; and</li>
<li>fixed various other smaller bugs and issues.</li>

<hr id="hr7"><p id="p8">One week later, the dust has finally settled, and we’re beginning to take the next steps towards redesigning MacStories. So far, most of the work we’ve done has been behind the scenes, but it sets the stage for ideas we’ve tossed around for years. Soon, we’ll settle on a path forward that’s designed to accomplish two things:</p>
<ul id="ul9"><li>Create an experience for readers and listeners that will make MacStories their favorite place to visit on the web; and</li>
<li>Do it in a way that is sustainable and reflects <a href="https://www.macstories.net/about/#what-guides-us" rel="noopener noreferrer">the values that guide us</a>.</li>
</ul><p id="p10">Our ambitions are big, but our love for MacStories and the community surrounding it is even bigger, so while we can move faster than ever, we’ll also be taking the care needed to preserve what makes MacStories special even as it changes. We can’t wait to share more with you soon.</p>
