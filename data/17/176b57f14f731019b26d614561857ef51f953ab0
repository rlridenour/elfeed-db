<p>Three of Europe’s largest aerospace groups — Airbus, Leonardo and Thales — agreed a preliminary deal to merge their space businesses to create a single broadband-satellite company aimed at competing with SpaceX’s Starlink, a move framed as a response to Starlink’s rapid expansion [ft.com#1][theguardian.com#1][ndtv.com#1]. The firms said they will pool loss-making satellite manufacturing activities and seek “significant synergies” to accelerate scale and lower costs [ndtv.com#1][ft.com#1]. Observers note the plan represents a strategic shift from Europe’s historic focus on large, high-orbit craft toward low-Earth-orbit broadband constellations, and reporting says the initiative (dubbed in coverage as “Project Bromo”) could begin operations from 2027 as Europe tries to catch up with incumbents [semafor.com#1][ft.com#1][theguardian.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eiV5xVj3b6ScFPjeUSJg64hBdzJOgzyH54XcSg0uAs1Sf16W_T71mIq_MZwqRTnGf4BmqRq6LcNVinX96U06kWQ4REZv9sAvK7RrMWfSj8ZvbLGPyjAt2yMyDKGz8HKN1kiPRHW9aHgGZGmqE1cmYgPhniizw6AHLu9_PELp21aWRutARG4AoO3YmeF6Woxsh6QYAua0AV-qm85yyZW96q10RaZ6XXkhEaumpT-nwej4O5Lmt2kwh2sVms8AJ7TgM6WAn8AvTq3guFTj9pAl' alt='Aerospace groups link up to create a European rival to SpaceX' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Strategic pivot: Europe’s top satellite makers are moving away from building large, complex high-orbit spacecraft toward small low-Earth-orbit broadband satellites to match market disruption from constellations like Starlink [semafor.com#1][ft.com#1].</li><li>Competitive field: Besides SpaceX, Amazon’s Project Kuiper and several state-backed Chinese groups have begun launches, meaning the new European player will enter a crowded, fast-growing broadband-satellite market [semafor.com#1].</li><li>Defence angle: European defence-linked divisions framed the consolidation as delivering strategic synergies and industrial scale to supply sovereign secure connectivity needs [ft.com#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Airbus, Leonardo and Thales (consortium): The companies said combining space businesses will create scale and synergies to respond to the rapid expansion of rival broadband constellations and to strengthen their satellite manufacturing footprint.
