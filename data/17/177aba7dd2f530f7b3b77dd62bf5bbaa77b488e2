  <p>Grok 4 Heavy is the “think much harder” version of Grok 4 that’s
currently only available on their $300/month plan. Jeremy Howard
relays a report from a Grok 4 Heavy user who wishes to remain
anonymous: it turns out that Heavy, <a href="https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_fb5f16af-9590-4880-9d96-58573c7e1293">unlike regular Grok 4</a>, has
measures in place to prevent it from sharing its system prompt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most big LLMs do not share their system prompts, but xAI has <a href="https://x.com/jeremyphoward/status/1943871257134739866">made a show out of being transparent</a> in that regard.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In related prompt transparency news, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/12/grok/">Grok’s retrospective</a>
on why Grok started spitting out antisemitic tropes last week
included the text “You tell it like it is and you are not afraid
to offend people who are politically correct” as part of the
system prompt blamed for the problem. That text isn’t present in
<a href="https://github.com/xai-org/grok-prompts/commits/main/">the history</a> of their previous published system prompts.</p>

<p>Given the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/12/grok/">past week of mishaps</a> I think xAI would be wise to
reaffirm their dedication to prompt transparency and set things up
so the <a href="https://github.com/xai-org/grok-prompts">xai-org/grok-prompts</a> repository updates
automatically when new prompts are deployed — their current manual
process for that is clearly not adequate for the job!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Transparently publishing system prompt changes to GitHub was xAI’s main “trust us” argument after <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/08/grok-praises-hitler">the “white genocide in South Africa” fiasco mid-May</a>. Turns out they don’t publish all of them.</p>
