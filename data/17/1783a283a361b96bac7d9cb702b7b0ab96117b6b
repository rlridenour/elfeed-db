Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/">announced</a> financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025, which corresponds to the third calendar quarter of the year.<br/>
<br/>

For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of &#36;102.5 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;27.5 billion, or &#36;1.85 per diluted share, compared to revenue of &#36;94.9 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;14.7 billion, or &#36;0.97 per diluted share, in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/apple-4q-2024-earnings/">year-ago quarter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's profits in the year-ago quarter were hit hard by a one-time charge of &#36;10.2 billion over <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/apple-must-pay-ireland-13-billion-euros/">tax issues in the European Union</a>. Without that one-time charge, Apple's profits in the year-ago quarter would have been &#36;1.64 per share.<br/>
<br/>
Gross margin for the most recent quarter was 47.2 percent, compared to 46.2 percent in the year-ago quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly dividend payment of &#36;0.26 per share, payable on November 13 to shareholders of record as of November 10.<br/>
<br/>
Apple set September quarter records for total revenue, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> revenue, and earnings per share, and an all-time record for Services revenue.<br/>
<br/>
For the full fiscal year, Apple recorded &#36;416.2 billion in sales and &#36;112.0 billion in net income, compared to &#36;391.0 billion in sales and &#36;93.7 billion in net income for fiscal 2024. Both numbers set all-time fiscal year records for Apple, topping previous highs set in fiscal 2022.<blockquote>"Today, Apple is very proud to report a September quarter revenue record of &#36;102.5 billion, including a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and an all-time revenue record for Services," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "In September, we were thrilled to launch our best iPhone lineup ever, including iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, and iPhone Air. In addition, we launched the fantastic AirPods Pro 3 and the all-new Apple Watch lineup. When combined with the recently announced MacBook Pro and iPad Pro with the powerhouse M5 chip, we are excited to be sharing our most extraordinary lineup of products as we head into the holiday season."</blockquote>As has been the case for over five years now, Apple is once again not issuing detailed guidance for the current quarter ending in December, though it should provide some color on things in its conference call.<br/>

<br/>
<b>2:26 pm</b>: Now we're moving to the Q&A portion of the call.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:27 pm</b>: Q: Why do you think the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; is having the degree of success it is as this point? Is this the age of the install base replacement cycle, specific features or functionality this cycle?<br/>
<br/>
A: I think it's all about the product. The lineup is incredibly strong, our strongest ever. The Pro is the most pro phone we've ever done, the design sings, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> feels so thin and light in your hand it feels like it's going to fly away. And then the 17 phone is an incredible value and brings several features that were reserved for Pro and brings them down to the consumer lineup. Strongest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup ever and it's resonating around the world.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:29 pm</b>: Q: Can you discuss your approach to managing component cost inflation? Memory prices are going through some pretty significant inflation. <br/>
<br/>
A: We have a world class procurement team and they're finding ways to drive cost opportunities. We're seeing changes in memory and storage prices, but as seen in our gross margin performance, I think we're managing costs pretty well. We just launched a bunch of new products and they do have a higher cost structure, but we focus on getting those costs down over time.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:30 pm</b>: Q: Can you talk about &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in China? How is that trend going into December and have you turned the corner there?<br/>
<br/>
A: I was just there, store traffic is up significantly, it's incredibly vibrant and dynamic. The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; family has been very well received there. We believe that we'll return to growth in Q1, largely based on the reception of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; there. I couldn't be more pleased with how things are going there in the early going.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:31 pm</b>: Q: Wondering if the antitrust ruling, if there was anything in the Google trial that affected your performance in Services.<br/>
<br/>
A: There was no tax related impact, our strong performance in the quarter was really organically driven. Nothing abnormal at all, pretty much all organic growth.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: Q: Services revenue growth was the fastest across many categories and fastest in the last two years, if you could unpack the drivers of the acceleration — was there cross selling with the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; launch, install base growth, you've been doing a lot of bundling with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> One, any thoughts on that would be very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
A: The way we looked at it, it's not one thing to point to. It's higher than we've seen the last few quarters but the Services profile is very broad with lots of different businesses. Our strength was very broad across categories and geographically, so wouldn't point to one factor that drove any kind of performance.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:34 pm</b>: Q: On &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sell-through, are you seeing any notable shifts in trends between sell-through coming from upgraders versus switchers, US carrier dynamics, promotional activity and channel inventory?<br/>
<br/>
A: We set a September quarter record for upgraders so it was a great quarter from that point of view, it's too early in the cycle on 17 to make any comments about upgraders or switchers. In terms of channel inventory we ended the quarter toward the lower end of the targeted range. We are constrained today on several models of &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; today, there's not a ramp issue we just have very strong demand. We are working hard to fill all the orders that we have.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:35 pm</b>: Q: Can you walk through the expectations on gross margin in December quarter, I think it implies up 30 basis points, can you talk through the puts and takes on there?<br/>
<br/>
A: Targeting 47-48 percent, a lot of puts and takes. This is a quarter we launched a lot of new products that are more expensive than those we replace, those were more favorable mix and higher leverage, those are the two big drivers but really favorable mix from the product side.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:37 pm</b>: Q: For China, what resulted in the weakness over there and the pause, what drove the weakness in September? What is the uptick for December?<br/>
<br/>
A: Greater China revenue was down 4% year over year, driven by &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and if you look at the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, the majority of the sequential year over year change was due to supply constraints mentioned earlier. That drove the results. We're thrilled with what we're seeing now with traffic up and the reception of the 17 family. We expect a return to growth this quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:38 pm</b>: Q: Regarding constraints and demand for iPhones, do you see yourself exiting December without constraints or do you think they'll still be there at the end of the quarter? Do you know what revenue might have been without constraints?<br/>
<br/>
A: If you look at the supply constraints, we are constrained on several 17 models. We're not predicting when the supply/demand will balance. We're obviously working very hard to achieve that, we want to get as many of these products out to people as possible. Today I'm not going to predict.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:39 pm</b>: Q: Talked about new records across a lot of categories and services. I didn't hear search explicitly called out. There are some concerns about search volumes decelerating at the expense of AI, how do you see these growth rates continuing for services?<br/>
<br/>
A: Advertising, which is a combination of third-party and first-party, did set a record during the quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Both Apple's internal advertising and external set record?<br/>
<br/>
A: I'm not saying that, we don't split that out. I'm dodging the question intentionally.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:41 pm</b>: Q: Strong momentum in China, what are your thoughts on subsidies in that region and how they play a role?<br/>
<br/>
A: The subsidies play a favorable role, they're across multiple categories from PCs to tablets, smartwatches and smartphones, but it only applies to certain price ranges, there's a maximum price. Several of our products are above that price are not eligible for a subsidy. It does have a favorable effect and is driving some consumer demand.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:42 pm</b>: Q: On OpEx increase into December, that's a sizable step up. What are the components and that increase in OpEx exceeds your revenue growth, should we expect this to continue?<br/>
<br/>
A: As we've been outlining, we are increasing our investments in AI, while also continuing to invest in our product roadmap. Vast majority of the increase is R&D, we're managing the company in a thoughtful and disciplined way an we're managing the business for the long term. We have seen OpEx growing faster than revenue, but we've seen gross margin expansion and operating income growth has been outpacing revenue growth for the past several years.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:43 pm</b>: Q: Can you help us understand the tariff impact sequentially from September to December, especially around &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; supply constraints, tariffs going from &#36;1.1 billion to &#36;1.4 billion, but the uplift on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue and production will be dramatically bigger so how do these tariff headwinds work as we move forward?<br/>
<br/>
A: Yes, &#36;1.1 to projection of &#36;1.4, that's based on what we know right now and where the tariff rates and policies are. It assumes a stable environment for the quarter. It does comprehend the changes that were just made that we were very encouraged to see with the tariffs moving from 20% to 10% in China. That is factored in and is one of the reasons why it's not linear to volume.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:45 pm</b>: Q: When you think about it, you're going into a holiday season, the attach possibilties for other products to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in this season, is there an opportunity to see upside to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; attach?<br/>
<br/>
A: We always like to remind people who buy an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; of all the other things that we offer. We're definitely doing that. From a Mac point of view, the challenge was the last year was the mother of all Mac launches. All of these, from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> to all the MacBook Pros all launched literally at the same time. That compares to launching the 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, so it's a very difficult compare. In the long run, I'm very bullish on the Mac. You can see that the Mac again last quarter outgrew the market. We feel really well about how Mac is positioned but this certain quarter is an extremely difficult compare. We also had the DRAM upgrade last year for the Mac lineup, another factor.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:47 pm</b>: Q: On the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; constraints, is there a way to quantify how much business was left on the table because of the constraints, and does different &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; manufacturing from different regions contribute to the constraints?<br/>
<br/>
A: It was not related to manufacturing capacity per se. We called the number of &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; that we were going to make and we were a bit short of the demand, we're a bit short of where demand really was. We're not publicly estimating the extent of that. On &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, the demand is very strong and we came out of Q4 with lots of backorders.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:48 pm</b>: Q: Given the prevalence of chatbots and AI-infused web services, do you think that could change consumer behavior on the mobile app ecosystem or are you seeing any of that? Would there be any impact on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;?<br/>
<br/>
A: I think there are opportunities on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; with artificial intelligence. We have made our on-device models available for developers and we've seen developers begin to adopt them. As that proliferates, there's an opportunity for developers and Apple to benefit from that.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:49 pm</b>: Q: When we look at the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; demand, has there been any discernable changes in mix relative to prior cycles?<br/>
<br/>
A: It's too early to call to the mix to be honest, and we don't publicly disclose that for competitive reasons, but we don't know what the mix will be because we have constraints at both the top and at the entry, we'll see what happens as we get more supply.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:50 pm</b>: Q: As we work through the AI narrative, can you provide thoughts on the build out of AI's private compute cloud?<br/>
<br/>
A: Our PCC is being used today for a number of queries for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, and we will continue to build it out. The manufacturing plant that makes the servers used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> just started manufacturing in Houston a few weeks ago and we've got a ramp planned there for use in our data centers. It's robust. In 2025 we did have CapEx costs associated with PCC environment in our first party data centers, so some of that would be in our CapEx invest this year.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:51 pm</b>: Q: Does the consumer reception on &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; give you a feel on the foldable phone market or are the two form factors too different?<br/>
<br/>
A: I'm not sure that one is a proxy for the other. The thing that I would say, we don't get into the model demand, at the aggregate level we're thrilled with how &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has been received and that's why we're expecting double-digit growth in the coming quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:52 pm</b>: Q: On personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, would you continue to use the three-prong approach with your own foundation models, partner with LLM providers or potential M&A?<br/>
<br/>
A: We're continuing Apple foundation models, we ship them on device and use them in the Private Cloud Compute as well. We have several in development. We also continually surveil the market on M&A and are open to pursuing M&A if we think it will advance our roadmap.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:53 pm</b>: Q: We've often seen Apple be a fast follower, whether with large displays or 4G/5G, are you seeing AI capabilities being a material purchase consideration for consumers or are your record sales levels reflecting other factors?<br/>
<br/>
A: There are many factors that influence people's purchasing considerations. We don't have a great, in-depth survey yet on the current &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; yet. It's very new in the cycle and we give it some time to formulate. I would say that &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; is a factor. We're very bullish on it becoming a greater factor. That's the way that we look at it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:54 pm</b>: Q: In the wake of every other tech company raising their CapEx in advance of AI demand, and mentioning scarce capacity, do you anticipate changing your hybrid approach to your own and third-party data centers and the role for Apple silicon?<br/>
