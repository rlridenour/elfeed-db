         
         <p>Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
note-taking and file-naming tool for Emacs.</p>

<p>Denote is based on the idea that files should follow a predictable and
descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear
indication of what the contents are about, without reference to any
other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation of such
files or file names while providing facilities to link between them
(where those files are editable).</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a constistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Version 2.3.0 on 2024-03-24</h2>

<p>This release brings a host of user-facing refinements to an already
stable base, as well as some impressive new features. There is a lot
to cover, so take your time reading these notes.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the numerous
refinements to parts of the code base. Some of these are not directly
visible to users, but are critical regardless. In the interest of
brevity, I will not be covering the most technical parts here. I
mention Jean-Philippe’s contributions at the outset for this reason.
Though the Git commit log is there for interested parties to study
things further.</p>

<h3>Check out the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-explore</code> package by Peter Prevos</h3>

<p>This package provides several neat extensions that help you make
better sense of your knowledge base, while keeping it in good order.
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-explore</code> package has commands to summarise the usage of
keywords, visualise connections between notes, spot infrequently used
keywords, and jump to previous historical entries.</p>

</ul>

<p>Now on to Denote version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.3.0</code>!</p>

<h3>Link to a heading inside a Denote Org file</h3>

<p>Denote creates links to files by using their unique identifier. As Org
provides the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUSTOM_ID</code> property for per-heading identifiers, we now
leverage this infrastructure to compose links that point to a file and
then to a heading therein. This only works for Org, as no other plain
text major mode has a concept of heading identifiers (and it is not
Denote’s job to create such a feature).</p>

<p>I demonstrated the functionality in a video:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-01-20-emacs-denote-link-org-headings/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-01-20-emacs-denote-link-org-headings/</a></p>

<p>Technically, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:</code> link type has the same implementation
details as Org’s standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file:</code> and has always had this potential to
jump to a section inside the given file.</p>

<h4>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-store-link-to-heading</code> user option</h4>

<p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-store-link-to-heading</code> determines whether
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-store-link</code> links to the current Org heading (such links are
merely “stored” and need to be inserted afterwards with the command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-insert-link</code>). Note that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-capture</code> command uses the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-link</code> internally if it has to store a link.</p>

<p>When its value is non-nil, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-store-link</code> stores a link to the
current Org heading inside the Denote Org file. If the heading does
not have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUSTOM_ID</code>, it creates it and includes it in the heading’s
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PROPERTIES</code> drawer. If a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUSTOM_ID</code> exists, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-store-link</code> use it
as-is.</p>

<p>This makes the resulting link a combination of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:</code> link type,
pointing to the identifier of the current file, plus the value of the
heading’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUSTOM_ID</code>, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[denote:20240118T060608][Some test]]</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[denote:20240118T060608::#h:eed0fb8e-4cc7-478f-acb6-f0aa1a8bffcd][Some test::Heading text]]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Both lead to the same Denote file, but the latter jumps to the heading
with the given <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUSTOM_ID</code>. Notice that the link to the heading also
has a different description, which includes the heading text.</p>

<p>The value of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUSTOM_ID</code> is determined by the Org user option
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-id-method</code>. The sample shown above uses the default UUID
infrastructure.</p>

<p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-store-link-to-heading</code> is set to a nil value, the
command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-store-link</code> only stores links to the Denote file (using
its identifier), but not to the given heading. This is what Denote was
doing in all versions prior to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.3.0</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Kristoffer Balintona for discussing with me how
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-capture</code> interfaces with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-store-link</code>. I updated the
documentation accordingly. This was done in issue 267:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/267">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/267</a>.</p>

<h4>Insert link to an Org file with a further pointer to a heading</h4>

<p>As part of the optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras.el</code> extension that comes
with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> package, the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras-link-to-heading</code>
prompts for a link to an Org file and then asks for a heading therein,
using minibuffer completion. Once the user provides input at the two
prompts, the command inserts a link at point which has the following
pattern: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[denote:IDENTIFIER::#ORG-HEADING-CUSTOM-ID]][Description::Heading text]]</code>.</p>

<p>Because only Org files can have links to individual headings, the
command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras-link-to-heading</code> prompts only for Org files
(i.e. files which include the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.org</code> extension). Remember that Denote
works with many file types.</p>

<p>This feature is similar to the concept of the aforementioned user
option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-store-link-to-heading</code>. It is, however, interactive
and differs in the directionality of the action. With that user
option, the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-store-link</code> will generate a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUSTOM_ID</code> for
the current heading (or capture the value of one as-is), giving the
user the option to then call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-insert-link</code> wherever they see fit.
By contrast, the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras-link-to-heading</code> prompts
for a file, then a heading, and inserts the link at point.</p>

<h3>Refinements galore to minibuffer prompts</h3>

<h4>All commands that affect file names conform with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-prompts</code></h4>

<p>The scope of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-prompts</code> user option is broadened to make it
more useful. In the past, this variable would only affect the
behaviour of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> command. For example, the user would make
the command prompt for a subdirectory, then keywords, then a title.
But all other commands were not following this setting, as they were
hardcoding the prompts for title and keywords.</p>

<p>Take the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-subdirectory</code> command as an example. It would first
prompt for a subdirectory to place the new note in, then for a title,
and then for keywords. Whereas now, it prepends the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subdirectory</code>
prompt to the list of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-prompts</code>. So if the user has configured
their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-prompts</code> to, for example, ask for a signature and a file
type, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-subdirectory</code> will do just that with the addition of
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subdirectory</code> prompt.</p>

<p>Same idea for all commands that either create or modify file names,
wherever conformity with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-prompts</code> makes sense. For example,
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-file</code> will never ask for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subdirectory</code> because
our renaming policy is to always rename in place (to avoid
mistakes—you can always move the file afterwards).</p>

<p>This also means that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-file</code> and its multi-file
counterpart, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired-rename-files</code>, will only prompt for a
signature if it is part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-prompts</code>. Whereas in the
previous version this was unconditional, thus burdening users who do
not need the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGNATURE</code> file name component (more about renaming
further into the release notes).</p>

<p>Lots of Git commits went into this redesign, per my initiave in issue
247: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/247">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/247</a>. Thanks to
Vedang Manerikar for the changes to the convenience wrappers of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> command (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-subdirectory</code>), which were done in pull
request 248: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/248">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/248</a>.</p>

<p>Vedang has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>Also thanks to Max Brieiev for joining the technical discussion
therein.</p>

<p>The renaming commands are more intuitive now, which addresses a
discussion point raised by user babusri in issue 204:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/204">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/204</a>.</p>

<h4>A simple tweak for more informative minibuffer prompts</h4>

<p>The text of each prompt now has all capital letters for the word
referencing its scope of its application, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TITLE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KEYWORDS</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGNATURE</code>. The idea is to make it easier to quickly scan the text,
especially while working through multiple prompts. For example, the
prompt for a title now reads:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>New file TITLE:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This paradigm is followed by all prompts. It is a small yet effective
tweak to get a better sense of context.</p>

<h4>The file prompt uses relative names once again</h4>

<p>In previous versions of Denote, the minibuffer prompt to pick a file
(such as a file to link to) would show relative file names: the name
without the full file system path. The functionality depended on the
built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project.el</code> library, which did not allow us to do everything
we wanted with our prompts, such as to have a dedicated minibuffer
history or to easily enable the workflow of commands like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-open-or-create</code>.</p>

<p>In the previous version, I made the decision to remove the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project.el</code> dependency and the concomitant presentation of relative
names in order to add the functionality we want. I did it with the
intention to find a better solution down the line. Et voilá! Relative
file names are back. We now have all the functionality we need. Sorry
if in the meantime you had to deal with those longer names! It was a
necessary intermediate arrangement for the greater good.</p>

<p>For the technicalities, refer to the source code of the function
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-title-prompt</code>.</p>

<h4>Completion using previous inputs is now optional</h4>

<p>All our minibuffer prompts have their dedicated history (you can
persist histories with the built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">savehist-mode</code>). They store
previous values, giving the user easy access to their past input
values. Some of our commands not only record a history, but also
leverage it to provide completion. These commands are named in the
variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-prompts-with-history-as-completion</code>. As of this
writing, they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-title-prompt</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-signature-prompt</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-files-matching-regexp-prompt</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Users who do not want to use completion for those can set the new user
option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-history-completion-in-prompts</code> to a nil value.</p>

<h3>Renaming files got better all-round</h3>

<p>One of the pillars of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> package is its ability to rename
any file to use the efficient Denote file-naming scheme (makes file
names predictable and easy to retrieve even with rudimentary tools).
To this end, we provide several commands that affect file names,
beside the commands that create new files.</p>

<p>As noted above, the commands which rename files to follow the Denote
file-naming scheme now conform with the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-prompts</code>,
but there is more!</p>

<h4>A broadened scope for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-no-confirm</code> option</h4>

<p>The implementation of this user option is redone (i) to save the
underlying buffer outright if the user does not want to provide their
confirmation for a rename each time and (ii) to cover all relevant
commands that perform a rename operation. The assumption is that the
user who opts in to this feature is familiar with the Denote renaming
modalities and knows they are reliable.</p>

<p>The default is still the same: Denote always asks for confirmation
before renaming a file, showing the difference between the old and new
names, as well as any changes to the file’s contents. In this light,
buffers are not saved to give the user the chance to further inspect
the changes (such as by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff-buffer-with-file</code>).</p>

<p>Commands that will now skip all confirmation prompts to rename the file
and, where relevant, save the corresponding buffer outright:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-file</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired-rename-files</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired-rename-marked-files-with-keywords</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-file-using-front-matter</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-add-keywords</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-remove-keywords</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-add-signature</code> (new, more below)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-remove-signature</code> (new, more below)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rename a file by adding or removing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGNATURE</code> component</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGNATURE</code> is an optional free-form field that is part of a
Denote file name. A common use-case is to write sequence notes with
it, though Denote does not enforce any particular convention (you may
prefer to have it as a special kind of keyword for certain files that
simply stands out more due to its placement).</p>

<p>[ Besides, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-dired</code> command lets you filter and sort
  files while putting them in a fully fledged Dired buffer, so
  manually sequencing notes via their signature may not be needed. ]</p>

<p>We now provide two commands to add or remove a signature from file
names:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-add-signature</code> prompts for a file and a
signature. The default value for the file prompt is the file of the
currently open buffer or the file-at-point in a Dired buffer. The
signature is an ordinary string, defaulting to the selected file’s
signature, if any.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-remove-signature</code> uses the same file prompt as
above. It performs its action only if the selected file has a
signature. Otherwise, it does nothing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Files that do not have a Denote file name are renamed accordingly.
Though for such cases it is better to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-file</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired-rename-files</code> as they are more general.</p>

<h4>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-after-rename-file-hook</code> for optional post-rename operations</h4>

<p>All renaming commands run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-after-rename-file-hook</code> after a
successful operation. This is meant for users who want to do something
specific after the renaming is done.</p>

<h3>More optional features of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras.el</code></h3>

<p>I already covered the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras-link-to-heading</code>, though the
file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras.el</code> has some more optional goodies for those
who work with Org files.</p>

<h4>Create a note from the current Org subtree</h4>

<p>In Org parlance, an entry with all its subheadings and other contents
is a “subtree”. Denote can operate on the subtree to extract it from
the current file and create a new file out of it. One such workflow is
to collect thoughts in a single document and produce longer standalone
notes out of them upon review.</p>

<p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras-extract-org-subtree</code> (part of the
optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras.el</code> extension) is used for this purpose.
It creates a new Denote note using the current Org subtree. In doing
so, it removes the subtree from its current file and moves its
contents into a new file.</p>

<p>The text of the subtree’s heading becomes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#+title</code> of the new
note. Everything else is inserted as-is.</p>

<p>Read the documentation string of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras-extract-org-subtree</code>
or consult the manual for further details.</p>

<h4>Convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:</code> links to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file:</code> links</h4>

<p>Sometimes the user needs to translate all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:</code> link types to
their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file:</code> equivalent. This may be because some other tool does not
recognise <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:</code> links (or other custom links types—which are a
standard feature of Org, by the way). The user thus needs to (i)
either make a copy of their Denote note or edit the existing one, and
(ii) convert all links to the generic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file:</code> link type that
external/other programs understand.</p>

<p>The optional extension <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras.el</code> contains two commands
that are relevant for this use-case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:</code> links to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file:</code> links:</strong> The command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras-convert-links-to-file-type</code> goes through the
buffer to find all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:</code> links. It gets the identifier of the
link and resolves it to the actual file system path. It then
replaces the match so that the link is written with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file:</code> type
and then the file system path. The optional search terms and/or link
description are preserved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file:</code> links to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:</code> links:</strong> The command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras-convert-links-to-denote-type</code> behaves like the
one above. The difference is that it finds the file system path and
converts it into its identifier.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>The Denote Org dynamic blocks are now in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras.el</code></h4>

<p>As part of this version, all our dynamic blocks are defined in the
file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras.el</code>. The file which once contained these block
definitions, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-dblock.el</code>, now only has aliases for the new
function names and dipslays a warning about its deprecation.</p>

<p>There is no need to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require</code> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras</code> feature because
all of Denote’s Org dynamic blocks are autoloaded (meaning that they
work as soon as they are used). For backward compatibility, all
dynamic blocks retain their original names as an alias for the newer
one.</p>

<p>We will not remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-dblock.el</code> anytime soon to avoid any
potential breakage with people’s existing notes. Though if you are new
to this functionality, you better avoid the deprecated symbols.</p>

<h4>Org dynamic block to only insert missing links</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-missing-links</code> block is available with the command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras-dblock-insert-missing-links</code>. It is like the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-links</code> block (documented at length in the manual), except it
only lists links to files that are not present in the current buffer.
The parameters are otherwise the same:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#+BEGIN: denote-missing-links :regexp "YOUR REGEXP HERE" :sort-by-component nil :reverse-sort nil :id-only nil

#+END:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Remember to type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-c C-x C-u</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-dblock-update</code>) with point on the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#+BEGIN</code> line to update the block.</p>

<p>This brings back a feature that was deprecated in version 2.2.0, but
makes changes to it so that (i) it is more limited in scope and (ii)
available as a standalone Org dynamic block.</p>

<p>Thanks to Stephen R. Kifer, Peter Prevos, and Elias Storms for the
discussion which made it clear to me that users do have a need for
such functionality. This was done in the now-defunct mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C1db2104e-70bd-47f9-a7ed-b8d4bb370a7f%40app.fastmail.com%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/%3C1db2104e-70bd-47f9-a7ed-b8d4bb370a7f%40app.fastmail.com%3E</a>.</p>

<p>Also thanks to Vedang Manerikar for fixing an edge case bug. This was
done in pull request 260: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/260">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/260</a>.</p>

<p>Org dynamic blocks are a powerful feature which also showcases how far
we can go with Denote’s efficient file-naming scheme.</p>

<h3>Quality-of-life improvements</h3>

<p>Here I include other changes we made to existing functionality.</p>

<h4>BREAKING User-defined sluggification of file name components</h4>

<p>In the previous version, we introduced the user option
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-file-name-letter-casing</code>. This was used to control the letter
casing of file name components, but was ultimately not flexible enough
for our purposes. We are thus retiring it and replacing it with the
more powerful, but also more advanced, user option
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-file-name-slug-functions</code>.</p>

<p>For existing users of the deprecated functionality, you can still
preserve the input of a prompt verbatim with something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(setq denote-file-name-slug-functions
      '((title . denote-sluggify-title)
        (keyword . identity)
        (signature . denote-sluggify-signature)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The manual explains the details and shows ready-to-use code samples.</p>

<p>Remember that deviating from the default file-naming scheme of Denote
will make things harder to use in the future, as files will have
permutations that create uncertainty. The sluggification scheme and
concomitant restrictions we impose by default are there for a very
good reason: they are the distillation of years of experience. Here we
give you what you wish, but bear in mind it may not be what you need.
You have been warned.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for introducing this variable,
among other tweaks, in pull request 217: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/217">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/217</a>.
Jean-Philippe has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<h4>Option to automatically save the buffer of a new note</h4>

<p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-save-buffer-after-creation</code> controls whether
commands that create new notes save their buffer right away.</p>

<p>The default behaviour of commands such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> (or related) is to
not save the buffer they create. This gives the user the chance to
review the text before writing it to a file. The user may choose to
delete the unsaved buffer, thus not creating a new file on disk.</p>

<p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-save-buffer-after-creation</code> is set to a non-nil value, such
buffers are saved automatically and so the file is written to disk.</p>

<h4>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-menu-bar-mode</code> and the placement of the Denote submenu</h4>

<p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-menu-bar-mode</code> toggles the inclusion of the
submenu with the Denote entries in the Emacs menu bar (which is on
display when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">menu-bar-mode</code> is enabled).</p>

<p>This submenu is now shown after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tools</code> entry.</p>

<p>Thanks to Joseph Turner for sending me the relevant patches. Joseph
has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<h4>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-c C-o</code> works in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">markdown-mode</code> for Denote links</h4>

<p>In files whose major mode is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">markdown-mode</code>, the default key binding
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-c C-o</code> (which calls the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">markdown-follow-thing-at-point</code>)
correctly resolves <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:</code> links. This method works in addition to
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RET</code> key, which is made available by the buttonization that we
also provide. Interested users can refer to the function
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-link-markdown-follow</code> for the implementation details.</p>

<p>Thanks to user pmenair for noting a case where this was breaking
general Markdown linking functionality. This was done in issue 290:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/290">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/290</a>.</p>

<h4>More fine-grained control of Denote faces for dates/identifiers</h4>

<p>We now define more faces for fine-grained control of the identifier in
Dired. Thanks to mentalisttraceur for suggesting the idea in issue
276: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/276">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/276</a>.</p>

<p>Before you ask, no, none of my themes will cover those faces because
extra colouration is something only the user can decide if they want
or not. In the above link I provide a sample with a screenshot (apart
from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code>, my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">standard-themes</code> have
similar functionality):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(defun my-modus-themes-denote-faces (&amp;rest _)
  (modus-themes-with-colors
    (custom-set-faces
     `(denote-faces-year ((,c :foreground ,cyan)))
     `(denote-faces-month ((,c :foreground ,magenta-warmer)))
     `(denote-faces-day ((,c :foreground ,cyan)))
     `(denote-faces-time-delimiter ((,c :foreground ,fg-main)))
     `(denote-faces-hour ((,c :foreground ,magenta-warmer)))
     `(denote-faces-minute ((,c :foreground ,cyan)))
     `(denote-faces-second ((,c :foreground ,magenta-warmer))))))

(add-hook 'modus-themes-post-load-hook #'my-modus-themes-denote-faces)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4>New convenience command for users of the optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-extras.el</code></h4>

<p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-extras-link-or-create-entry</code> links to the
journal entry for today or creates it in the background, if missing,
and then links to it from the current file. If there are multiple
journal entries for the same day, it prompts to select one among them
and then links to it. When called with an optional prefix argument
(such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-u</code> with default key bindings), the command prompts for a
date and then performs the aforementioned. With a double prefix
argument (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-u C-u</code>), it also produces a link whose description
includes just the file’s identifier.</p>

<p>Thanks to Alan Schmitt for contributing this command, based on
previous discussions. It was done in pull request 243:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/243">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/243</a>.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-dired</code> function no longer errors out when there is
no match for the given search terms. Thanks to Vedang Manerikar for
the initial patch! This was done in the now-defunct mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/47625">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/denote/patches/47625</a>. Further
changes by me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-keywords-sort</code> function no longer tries to sort keywords
that are not a list. Thanks to Ashton Wiersdorf for the patch. The
change is small. As such, Ashton does not need to assign copyright
to the Free Software Foundation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Documented in the manual that custom convenience commands can be
accessed by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-command-prompt</code>. Thanks to Glenna D. for
clarifying the language.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-user-enforced-denote-directory</code> is obsolete. Those who
used it in their custom code can simply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> bind the value of the
variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code>. Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for
making the relevant changes (the Git history is not direct here and
I cannot quickly find the pull request—the commit is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a48a1da</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-link-return-links</code> no longer keeps buffers around.
Thanks to Matteo Cavada for the patch. This was done in pull request
252: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/252">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/252</a>. The change is
small and so Matteo does not need to assign copyright to the Free
Software Foundation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thanks to user jarofromel (recorded in Git as “random” author) for
fixing a mismatched parenthesis in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-parse-date</code>. This was
done in pull request 258: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/258">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/258</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-buffer-mode</code> now works as expected with
non-editable files, like PDFs. Thanks to Alan Schmitt for bringing
this matter to my attention and then refining the implementation
details in pull request 268: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/268">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/268</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the Denote linking functions can be used from any file outside
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code> (links are still resolved to files inside the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code>). Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the
contribution in pull request 236: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/236">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/236</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We removed all glue code that integrated Denote with the built-in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffap</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xref</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project</code> libraries. We may reconsider how best
to organise such features in the future. Thanks to Noboru Ota
(nobiot), who originally contributed those extensions, for
suggesting their removal from our code base. We did this by
evaluating all use-cases. The discussion with Noboru happened in
issue 264: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/264">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/264</a>. Also
thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay and Alan Schnmitt for checking
the impact of this on how we generate backlinks. The latest
iteration of this was done in pull request 294, by Jean-Philippe:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/294">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/294</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While renaming files, signatures no longer lose consecutive spaces.
Thanks to Wesley Harvey for the contribution in pull request 207:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/207">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/207</a>. The change is
within the ~15 line limit and so Wesley does not need to assign
copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of the above and lots more are documented at length in the
manual. This is a big task in its own right (as are release notes,
by the way), though it ensures we keep a high standard for the
entire package and can communicate all our knowledge to the user.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>No more SourceHut</h3>

<p>Development continues on GitHub with GitLab as a mirror. I explained
my reasons here: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-01-27-sourcehut-no-more/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-01-27-sourcehut-no-more/</a>.</p>

<p>This is a change that affects all my Emacs packages.</p>

<h3>Forward guidance for Denote version 3.0.0</h3>

<p>We will not any new features until mid-April or a bit later if
necessary. This gives users enough time to report any potential issues
with version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2.3.0</code>. If there are any bugs, they will be fixed right
away and new minor releases will be introduced (though without release
notes).</p>

<p>Once we are done with this release cycle, we want to prepare for the
next major version of Denote. The plan is to make the placement of
file name components entirely customisable, among many other power
user features. Though the defaults will remain intact.</p>

<p>For the immediate future, please prioritise bug reports/fixes. Then
see you around for another round of hacking. The Denote code base is a
pleasure to work with due to how composable everything is. I happy to
make it even better for developers and users alike.</p>

<h3>All contributions are valuable</h3>

<p>I encourage you to provide feedback on any of the functionality of the
Denote package. You do not need to be a developer or indeed an expert
in Emacs. When you have an idea in mind on how you use Denote, or you
think something could be done differently, please speak your mind. I
do listen to feedback and am interested in further improving this
package. Everybody is welcome!</p>
