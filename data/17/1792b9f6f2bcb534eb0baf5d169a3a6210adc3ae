<p>In Oslo, the trial of Marius Borg Høiby, the 29‑year‑old son of Norway’s Crown Princess Mette‑Marit, has opened with prosecutors outlining 38 charges that include rape, abuse in close relationships, assault, drug possession and traffic offences allegedly committed between 2018 and late 2024. Høiby, who holds no royal title or official role, pleaded not guilty to four counts of rape and to a charge of domestic violence, but admitted several lesser offences such as certain assaults, narcotics offences, traffic violations and breaches of restraining orders. Prosecutors say multiple women accuse him of attacks that followed consensual sex, often after heavy drinking when they say they were not able to defend themselves, while his defence argues he perceived all encounters as normal, consensual relations. The high‑profile case, which could carry a prison sentence of up to 16 years if he is convicted of the most serious offences, has intensified scrutiny of the Norwegian royal family and comes as unsealed US documents highlighted Crown Princess Mette‑Marit’s past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, adding further pressure on the monarchy’s public image.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/6ssasIhS07ub7nxD_bedR3AtkOoFf8G9iCcUiHmlyAbG4dFxJ_sR0QCk9YjG_YXZ8JlUCA08dV-QZIKVNcW0IYckgAzrfpJs0pfNWR0jMm7o' alt='Courtroom sketch of Marius Borg Høiby during the opening day of his trial at Oslo District Court.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>New weekend arrest: Just days before the trial, police arrested Høiby again on suspicion of making threats with a knife, assault and violating a restraining order, and a court ordered him held in custody for four weeks.</li><li>Alleged incident setting: One of the alleged rapes is reported to have taken place during a 2023 holiday in Norway’s Lofoten Islands, where Høiby was travelling with Crown Prince Haakon, according to the indictment described in court.</li><li>Victim protections: At least one alleged victim testified on the opening day under strict media reporting limits intended to protect her privacy during the sensitive proceedings.</li><li>Courtroom atmosphere: Reporters describe a packed Oslo district courtroom where Høiby appeared in casual clothing, largely expressionless with his head bowed, occasionally fidgeting as prosecutors read the list of charges.</li><li>Next steps: Høiby is scheduled to testify early in the trial, which is expected to run for several weeks as the court hears from complainants, witnesses, and expert psychologists.</li></ul><blockquote>If Marius says he is not guilty... it&#x27;s simply because he perceived all of the acts as perfectly normal and consensual sexual relations - Bjørn Gulstad</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prosecutors: Prosecutors argue that after evenings of heavy drinking, the women involved were no longer in a condition to resist or defend themselves when Høiby allegedly forced sex on them, and they describe a pattern of controlling and violent behaviour in several former relationships.
