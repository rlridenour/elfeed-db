<blockquote>
  <p>The redesign is more than skin deep, however. Apple has rethought
the way some of its most fundamental interactions work. For
example, the increasingly long horizontal popover menus that hid
options behind an interminable scroll have morphed into a
dual-stage design. Tapping and holding on the screen brings up a
popover with a few common options, but it now doesn’t make you
scroll; instead, there’s an arrow indicating more options. Tap
that, and you’ll get a big pop-up panel of all the available
commands in a much easier-to-read and use format. As someone who
frequently finds himself swiping through a very long list to find
the one command I want (and somehow, it’s always the last one),
this is a tangible improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The big improvement here is that in the old popover (from iOS 3 — when copy and paste were finally added to iOS, and the popover typically only contained three or four items — until last year’s iOS 18), the scrolling you had to do was horizontal. And a lot of items were added to that menu over the years. And it wasn’t really <em>scrolling</em>, it was <em>panning</em>. And panning sideways through a long list of options is just a bad interaction experience. For me, a <em>lot</em> of the times I used this popover, I wanted the “Share...” command, and that was the last one, all the way on the right.</p>

<p>In iOS 26’s new tap-and-hold popover, it’s a vertical menu, just like a Mac contextual menu. And you don’t really have to scroll at all most of the time, because all the contextual menu options fit on screen. And even if you do have to scroll (which happens when the keyboard is open, reducing vertical screen real estate), you don’t have to scroll much to get to the bottom.</p>

<p>It’s one of the very best, most thoughtful, most useful changes in iOS 26. But also one of the most overdue: we know how contextual menus should be oriented. Vertically. We naturally make lists vertically, not horizontally. I sort of suspect Apple resisted making iOS contextual popovers vertical for so long because they didn’t want to make iOS more like a desktop computer OS.</p>
