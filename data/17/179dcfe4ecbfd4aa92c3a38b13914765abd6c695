<p>New research says human-driven climate change intensified the torrential rains and flooding that swept parts of southern Africa over the past month, worsening impacts in multiple countries. Several outlets describe the event as a convergence of warmer baseline conditions and the naturally occurring La Niña pattern, which can shift rainfall and storm tracks. The flooding has been deadly and disruptive, with reports ranging from “dozens” of deaths to about 200 fatalities as the situation was tallied across the region, and with hundreds of thousands of people affected. Researchers and forecasters say the findings underscore both the need for faster emissions cuts and practical, hopeful steps like stronger early-warning systems and flood resilience to help communities better withstand increasingly intense downpours.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7IJF_67IviAR8qj9n4_fEfGUXr9RkV9O7g0Oc21QS0xbqvSrJIAh90792LUEkxKTBWPvydiAhMhrcKHm3MLywfxr1dHJTPTy31RzmMDqjLHSmPyLawG9XqPpGaHUJkFWFAzHVY8nMm40ddFhf2PxR4wrh9AHRYD05LT-bpEUvQ' alt='Flooding in southern Africa, as climate and weather factors converge.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Perfect-storm mix: The study described a “perfect storm” in which long-term warming and La Niña combined to amplify extreme rainfall conditions across the region.</li><li>Warmer oceans: Scientists highlighted that warmer oceans can load the atmosphere with more moisture, helping drive heavier downpours when storms develop.</li><li>Regional scale: Reporting framed the floods as a multi-country southern Africa event rather than a single localized disaster, complicating response and damage assessments.</li><li>Attribution focus: Researchers emphasized human-induced climate change as a measurable factor in the intensity of the rains, part of a growing body of event-attribution work.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Study researchers: Researchers concluded human-induced climate change worsened the recent torrential rains and flooding in southern Africa.
