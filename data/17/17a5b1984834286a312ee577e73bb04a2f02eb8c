<p id="p2">Apple has announced a new limited-edition iPhone accessory, the iPhone Pocket, created in collaboration with design brand ISSEY&nbsp;MIYAKE. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/11/introducing-iphone-pocket-a-beautiful-way-to-wear-and-carry-iphone/?1762851602" rel="noopener noreferrer">how Apple describes the accessory</a>, which will be available in select Apple Stores and online beginning Friday:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  iPhone Pocket features a ribbed open structure with the qualities of the original pleats by ISSEY MIYAKE. Born from the idea of creating an additional pocket, its understated design fully encloses iPhone, expanding to fit more of a user&rsquo;s everyday items. When stretched, the open textile subtly reveals its contents and allows users to peek at their iPhone display. iPhone Pocket can be worn in a variety of ways &mdash; handheld, tied onto bags, or worn directly on the body. Featuring a playful color palette, the short strap design is available in eight colors, and the long strap design in three colors.

<p id="p5">The iPhone Pocket comes in two styles. A short strap version will be available in eight colors: lemon, mandarin, purple, pink, peacock, sapphire, cinnamon, and black, while the longer strap model, which is long enough to wear like <a href="https://amzn.to/4qYtgYM" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s Crossbody Strap</a>, is limited to sapphire, cinnamon, and black.</p>
<p id="p6">The iPhone Pocket will be available starting Friday, November 14, for $149.95 for the short strap version and $229.95 for the long strap version from <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/hs8r2zm/a/iphone-pocket-by-issey-miyake-short-lemon" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s online store</a> and ten retail stores worldwide:</p>

<p id="p9">The iPhone Pocket makes a bold design statement that Apple says was &ldquo;[i]nspired by the concept of &lsquo;a piece of cloth.&rsquo;&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not going to venture to guess what that means. Still, the Pocket fits neatly into few Apple knit products that came before it echoing the thick ribbing of both <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mt073ll/a/apple-vision-pro-solo-knit-band-m" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Vision Pro Solo</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/dual-knit-band-sa/apple-vision-pro-dual-knit-band" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dual Knit Bands</a> and <a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/10/ipod-socks/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the iPod Socks</a>, a comparison that is inevitable though left unstated in Apple&rsquo;s press release.</p>
<p id="p10">Apple&rsquo;s connection with ISSEY&nbsp;MIYAKE goes back further, though. It was Miyake who designed <a href="https://www.fashionleague.io/issey-miyake-steve-jobs-turtlenecks-13082022" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Jobs&rsquo; signature black turtleneck</a>, according to <a href="https://amzn.to/43KHK4D" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Isaacson&rsquo;s biography</a> of Jobs. Now, all these years later, your iPhone can have a turtleneck of sorts for itself, too.</p>

<p id="p12">Fashion is nothing new to Apple accessories, but the company&rsquo;s emphasis on it has ebbed and flowed over the years. However, with the fashion-forward iPhone Air in its lineup and rumors of folding iPhones coming as soon as next year, it&rsquo;s not surprising that Apple is fanning the fashion flames. Some may see the Air as an iPhone that costs more but does less, but a big part of its appeal is its striking profile, for which others are willing to pay a premium. The iPhone Pocket fits that narrative perfectly.</p>
