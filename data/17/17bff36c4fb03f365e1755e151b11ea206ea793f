<p>The research will focus on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/holobiont" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holobionts</a> or &#8220;superorganisms&#8221;&#8212;host organisms and the things that live inside of them and on them. Traditional examples of  holobionts are coral reefs or lichens, though <a href="https://dailynous.com/2015/07/24/we-are-not-human-individuals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some have argued</a> that humans and many other organisms are better understood as holobionts. Professor Skillings <a href="https://researchmagazine.uncg.edu/2025-issue/diving-into-the-behavior-of-symbiotic-organisms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> that &#8220;We used to think these&#8230; amalgamations of symbioses were the exception in nature. But now we are realizing no, actually, it’s probably everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grant, which will support the project for three years, is from the <a href="https://www.templeton.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Templeton Foundation</a>. The project will involve research, workshops, and <a href="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/pabst-2025.png">a conference this summer</a>.</p>
