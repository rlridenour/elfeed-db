"We love that early energy," reads the Apple Store's message when visiting the U.S. website. "Almost ready for you. Pre-order begins at 5:00 a.m. PDT. See you soon." Apple has been doing 5:00 a.m. pre-orders for the last several years instead of the 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time pre-orders that it used to have.<br/>

Customers in more than 40 countries and regions, including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the UAE, the U.K., and the U.S., will be able to pre-order ‌‌iPhone 17‌‌ models when the store comes back online.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 17 will be available in Lavender, Sage, Mist Blue, White, and Black, in 256GB and 512GB storage capacities, while the iPhone Air will be available in Sky Blue, Light Gold, Cloud White, and Space Black, in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB capacities. <br/>
