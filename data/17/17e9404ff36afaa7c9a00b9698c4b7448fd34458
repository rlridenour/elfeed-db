<p>I really like this comment from Stas Boukarev on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/ctfk6d/methods_or_functions_when_do_i_use_which/">Methods or Functions, when do I use which</a> on reddit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[You] don&rsquo;t make an extensible program by just making each function generic, if each function still makes some assumption on the data. You can&rsquo;t say &ldquo;oh, it&rsquo;s extensible, but you have to define a hundred methods of your own&rdquo;, an extensible protocol will require defining a handful of pertinent methods and then the hundred of other functions will automatically work on new classes.</p>
