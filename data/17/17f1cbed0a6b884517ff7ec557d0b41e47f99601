<p>President Trump described European countries as &quot;decaying&quot; and led by &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;politically correct&quot; leaders in an interview with Politico, arguing they have mishandled migration and failed to do enough to end the war in Ukraine. He suggested US support could depend on whether European governments align with his administration’s positions, and signalled openness to backing European politicians who share his views. The comments, which follow a new US national security strategy highly critical of the EU, widened transatlantic tensions and prompted European officials to publicly reaffirm Europe’s strength, democratic values and commitment to behaving as reliable allies. President Trump also pressed Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky to hold elections despite the ongoing war, adding another sensitive point of friction between Washington, Kyiv and European partners.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/iAE3fbAJKytVg7LdWONNVc91OcLOXKFiako-sPG1t8jPK17ZUUrF3dM0tTQSO7X2UYuupczKajZYerUxVJhW0NKF1-wK8Wc57fee0od4DvUn' alt='President Trump during an event in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Migration focus: President Trump argued that European governments have adopted migration policies he called a &quot;disaster,&quot; listing countries including Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Sweden as being harmed by large-scale arrivals and by leaders’ reluctance to return migrants to their countries of origin.</li><li>Ukraine elections: In addition to criticising Europe, President Trump urged President Volodymyr Zelensky to organise elections in Ukraine despite the war, framing this as important for the country’s political trajectory while not detailing how ballots could be safely held.</li><li>New US strategy: His remarks came just days after Washington released a national security strategy that sharply criticised the EU’s migration approach and spoke of encouraging &quot;resistance&quot; inside Europe to liberal migration policies, language that unsettled many European observers.</li><li>Russian dimension: Asked about the Kremlin’s positive reaction to the new US strategy, President Trump said President Vladimir Putin &quot;would like to see a weak Europe&quot; and claimed Europe was already moving in that direction, while insisting this development was unrelated to his own policies.</li><li>European self-description: European commentary in outlets such as Spain’s El Mundo stressed that, in response to the criticism, EU figures highlighted Europe’s identity as a space of freedom and democratic values, although some analysts described these responses as somewhat muted.</li></ul><blockquote>Most European nations, they’re, they’re decaying.
