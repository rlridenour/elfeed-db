Apple today added the 11-inch and 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models to its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad/ipad-air">refurbished store in the United States</a>, offering these tablets at a discounted price in the U.S. for the first time since its May 2024 launch.<br/>

Refurbished &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models are discounted by approximately 15 percent compared to Apple's original pricing for new models. The 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with 128GB of storage is &#36;469, for example, while the base 13-inch 128GB &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is &#36;639. Apple originally sold the 11-inch &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; for &#36;549, and the 13-inch model for &#36;749.<br/>

The refurbished &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models were added to the UK store <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/refurbished-ipad-air-m2-chip/">earlier this month</a>, but they are new to the U.S. store.<br/>
<br/>
Apple replaced the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with the M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; earlier this year, so the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; models are the prior-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; option and can no longer be purchased new from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
There are multiple colors and capacities available as of the time of writing, as well as cellular and standard Wi-Fi models, but stock will fluctuate over time as Apple refreshes what's available. If you're aiming for a particular color or capacity, you might need to check back.<br/>
