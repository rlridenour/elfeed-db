My old colleague and friend Watts Martin has <a href="https://tracks.ranea.org/post/780817630854578176/the-robots-have-come-for-your-em-dashes">an interesting and amusing post on em dashes</a> and their indication of AI generated text. As many of you know, Irreal is an em dash friendly site [<a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=6876">1</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10157">2</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10159">3</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=11217">4</a>] and we spend a good portion of our pixel budget on them.

<p>
I was, therefore, surprised to discover from Martin&rsquo;s post that according to LinkedIn influencers, <i>real</i> people don&rsquo;t use em dashes—they use hyphens—and therefore em dashes are a sure sign of AI generated text. Once I got over the notion of a &ldquo;LinkedIn influencer&rdquo; and what that could possibly mean, I read Martin&rsquo;s explanation for this bizarre and clearly erroneous belief.

<p>
His explanation would make a fine Red Meat Friday post. The TL;DR is that LLM AIs are, by and large, trained on polished text where the use of em dashes is natural and common, whereas, sadly, many people can&rsquo;t write at all. That is, their reading and writing is restricted to things like emails or business memos that haven&rsquo;t had the benefit of even a first editing pass, let alone a final polishing. Most of these people don&rsquo;t read enough &ldquo;good&rdquo; writing to even know what it looks like.

Those of us who <i>do</i> use em dashes should feel flattered. We are, apparently, at least as good at writing as the current AIs. Of course, I&rsquo;d prefer the comparison to be to Iain M Bank&rsquo;s <a href="https://theculture.fandom.com/wiki/Mind">Minds</a>—this <i>is</i> <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?page_id=15">Irreal</a>, after all.</p>
