<p>&#8220;I’ve never felt my speech was so chilled as it was in the classroom at UATX.&#8221;<span id="more-56251"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s one student quoted in an <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2026/01/16/civil-war-university-of-austin-bari-weiss-00729688?nid=0000018f-3124-de07-a98f-3be4d1400000&amp;nname=politico-toplines&amp;nrid=994179d5-5162-42ea-ac74-2fb6cab3acb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article at <em>Politico</em></a> by Evan Mandery that describes how things have gone at the <a href="https://www.uaustin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Austin</a> (UATX).</p>
<p>UATX was announced in November 2021 as a &#8220;fiercely independent&#8221; institution of higher education dedicated to free expression and &#8220;the fearless pursuit of truth.&#8221; Claiming to be unbound by the political pieties of the day, it bragged about offering courses that covered &#8220;the most provocative questions that often lead to censorship or self-censorship in many universities.&#8221; Its inaugural class of students began in the fall of 2024.</p>
<p>As the end of the school year approached, in April of 2025, a member of the university&#8217;s board of trustees (and one of its major donors) summoned all of the faculty and staff for a meeting and reportedly told them that they must all subscribe to &#8220;the four principles of anti-communism, anti-socialism, identity politics, and anti-Islamism.&#8221; Whether he had the institutional authority to issue such a command is disputed.</p>

<p>That episode is just one in this fascinating history of the university.
