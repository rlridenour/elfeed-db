<p>President Trump reversed his months-long opposition and urged House Republicans to vote to compel the Justice Department to release investigative files on financier Jeffrey Epstein, saying &quot;we have nothing to hide&quot; and pressing lawmakers to &quot;move on&quot; from what he called a Democratic smear. The Republican-led House has scheduled a vote expected to take place on Nov. 18 and is widely seen as likely to pass the measure after a petition gathered enough support to force the floor action. Trump later said he would sign the legislation if the Senate also approves it, while Speaker Mike Johnson indicated the upper chamber may revise the bill to address protections for victims and whistleblowers. The move follows the recent public release of Epstein-related emails that renewed scrutiny of Epstein&#x27;s ties to powerful figures and intensified divisions inside the GOP.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wsi3p9Y_clK5BhJoChiJz_kL4FiuQT58ssWLm7ax_1TfEkW-DFoe3fCym9722xXaF8wRXe_WEEK1APgM4yCFykhIGfepFCb4luOfPxRBKexWgo1tMX2BHMA_1Bxm5QYWmQ4F0XNVaJNmBdxrqtDdnqbMIkeEfc6Ynttb2IqldzA4IlfcuD_oqhh7GR1s-74WEZ6Q9G04sUN3GYbPffzkKyIS7NCzv6pN_UhPY1973trtEy7TR840UAj-n8QZg_axrkWWkoTs1rVLpAOILg' alt='Rep.
