<p>With the beginning of the new year, I received meeting invitations for
a twice weekly meeting, on Mondays and Thursdays. I added this to my
Org agenda file, and used a diary-style expression. I <em>thought</em> I
could use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diary-float</code> for every Monday and another for
every Thursday, like this</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-org" data-lang="org">* Recurring meeting
&lt;%%(diary-float t 1 0) 11:30-12:00&gt;
&lt;%%(diary-float t 4 0) 11:30-12:00&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p>But when I looked my agenda, I didn’t see anything for Mondays or
Thursdays at 11:30-12:00. Hmm.</p>

<p>The help for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diary-float</code> only specifies how the third
argument, N, applies if it is positive or negative. It would be
nice if 0, or some other value like t, meant every week.</p>

<p>I eventually settled on</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-org" data-lang="org">* Recurring meeting
&lt;%%(diary-cyclic 7 1 5 2026) 11:30-12:00&gt;
&lt;%%(diary-cyclic 7 1 8 2026) 11:30-12:00&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p>for the meeting. It works, but it wasn’t obvious to me that this was
the way to go.</p>

<p>I could also have put 5 entries for Mondays and 5 for Thursdays, to
get all five possible occurences of each in a month. Seems kind of
weird, so I didn’t.</p>

<p>And finally, I could just use a regular +1w repeater, but then I need
to have two separate TODOs in my agenda file, one for Mondays and one
for Thursdays.</p>
