</ul><p id="p4">Long-time readers may remember the MacStoriesDeals Twitter account, which we stopped posting to almost seven years ago. We used that account as a way to share the deals that we came across. Over time, though, Apple slowed its app affiliate spending and then ended it altogether in 2017. That&rsquo;s when MacStoriesDeals went from a useful resource for readers that also made us a little extra money to a chore we couldn&rsquo;t justify spending the time on any longer.</p>
<p id="p5">However, times change. Today, affiliate linking is bigger than ever, and MacStories&rsquo; coverage has grown to encompass more gadget <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/getting-away-from-your-desk-with-jsauxs-flipgo-pro-dual-display/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/my-latest-mac-automation-tool-is-a-tiny-game-controller/" rel="noopener noreferrer">stories</a>, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/setups/" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Setups page</a>, and other media coverage on <a href="https://www.macstories.net/unwind/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacStories Unwind</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPC: Next Portable Console</a>. Plus, with the latest automation tools at our disposal, we can do more with MacStoriesDeals than we ever did before with less effort, which is why we&rsquo;re bringing it back.</p>
<p id="p6">There are plenty of other social media accounts and websites out there that aggregate deals, but MacStoriesDeals is going to be a little different. As we&rsquo;ve noted in <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/prime-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Prime Day coverage</a> the past couple of years, we only recommend deals for gear and media we&rsquo;ve tried and brands we trust. In other words, these aren&rsquo;t just any deals; they&rsquo;re deals we think are worth your time and consideration based on over 25 years of collective editorial experience.</p>
<p id="p7">The links you&rsquo;ll find on MacStoriesDeals are affiliate links, usually from the U.S.-based Amazon and Apple storefronts, that will earn us roughly 2-7% when you use one and buy something. Of course, that will be disclosed in the posts, as it already is in <a href="https://www.macstories.net/privacy-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the MacStories Privacy Policy</a>. Affiliate link revenue is a small part of MacStories&rsquo; annual income, but with the changes the Internet and online media are undergoing, every little bit helps us continue to bring you MacStories&rsquo; unique perspective on the Apple universe and beyond. Rest assured, our approach to MacStoriesDeals is the same as it is everywhere at MacStories: we aren&rsquo;t going to promote deals we don&rsquo;t believe are worth your time and attention.</p>
<p id="p8">We&rsquo;re excited to be revitalizing MacStoriesDeals. It was a great resource for readers looking for bargains in the early days of the site, and we aim to make it so again. We&rsquo;re also working on ways to do more for readers with MacStoriesDeals in the months ahead.</p>
<p id="p9">Thanks for supporting everything we do at MacStories. We hope MacStoriesDeals adds a little more to the experience and you consider following along with the deals we recommend on <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@MacStoriesDeals" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/macstoriesdeals.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a>.</p>
