</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A morning reflection on summer slipping into fall.  Of the hours of the day shrinking amidst the striking clock.
</p>
        <p>Here just around the 43rd, as the morning dawns a bit later each day, I too rise
a bit later each morning.  Instead of 6am, I wake closer to 7am.  There is now
less time between my waking and my starting work for my job.  I don’t like this
compression, favoring the greater space of life before the clock started.</p>
<p>Now, due to present projects, I’m trying to get about the work just a bit past
8am.  Which is not enough time to move from sleep to imposed thought.  Less time
to savor the morning coffee, read a bit, or walk the dogs.  And the shower seems
more urgent; something that I must slot into a narrowing window.</p>
<p>I am thankful I read <cite data-id="fb15e51e-3050-4d09-ab79-f6b6b1f916a8">Being Peace</cite> by Thich Nhat Hanh, as it talked of being
prepared when events explode.  And this dwindling morning feels not like an
explosion but an implosion, a collapse of time.  So I breathe and smile.
Readying myself for yet another day of expressing my understanding of a shared
model by asking questions, drawing diagrams, and writing instructions that both
machine and others (including my future self) should be able to understand.  I
am ever the digital cartographer and archaeologist.</p>
<p>I could compare my leisurely awakening with others and their hasty scamper to
punch into their timeclock.  Those that must do so before the sun has even
hinted at rising.  Yet that is not my present path—though once decades ago was.</p>
<p>I am aware of the tyrannous clock ticking away each second, demarcating an ever
arriving <em>Now</em> with a slipping away <em>Then</em>.  The drop of the executioners axe,
reminding that the present is so very narrow.  A measuring tool for the
managerial class eeking ever more out for capital.</p>
<p>Yet the world’s clock abides not by this same regimentation.  Depending on
latitude, season, and a bit of geography it lingers later and arrives earlier
than for others—or departs sooner and arrives later.  Its plotted sinusoidal
shape dictated by latitude; the greater the latitude the higher the crests and
lower the troughs.</p>
<p>Our clocks we establish and agree upon as defiance of nature.  To segment,
enclose, and dictate.</p>
<p>I am the sunrise.  The sunrise is me.  Where I am, now a bit slower to rise,
earlier to fall, as I pass the quarter-cross en route to autumnal equinox.</p>
<p>I think of my days of working in office.  Of busying myself and chatting around
the coffee maker; those moments of connection in which being dismissed early
felt like almost like gift yet more like when a teacher might wheel in a
television set to show a movie in the afternoon before an extended break.</p>
<p>And of working remote.  No longer feeling as though I must be always on, but
certainly far more tethered to my work machine during working hours.  Attending
to being visible lest it be thought I’m not there.</p>
<p>This morning in which I’ve chosen a written meditation, moves at its own pace.
I’ll soon move to prepare some coffee and take a quick shower.  My job awaits,
with its infinite nice to haves.  Yet no matter how many ticks nor tocks, it’ll
never draw closer to that infinite.  There is only this moment, in which the
pre-morning rain clouds made way for a resplendent dawn.</p>
