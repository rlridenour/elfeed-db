<p>I am arting here &gt; been so very busy working with a team of local artists on making this a successful little art space. We open to the public as a gallery every Saturday 12-6pm so swing by and say hello if you are in York. Give the insta <a href="https://www.instagram.com/piccadillypopupart/">@piccadillypopupart</a> a follow if you will. An exciting project in an interesting old building provided by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uthinkpdp/">@uthinkpdp</a> which we are all very grateful for.</p>
