In an <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1939558413459177897">article published on X</a>, Kuo explained that the device will feature a 13-inch display and the A18 Pro chip, making it the first Mac powered by an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; chip. The A18 Pro chip debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> last year. To date, all Apple silicon Macs have contained M-series chips, which offer higher core counts, support for larger amounts of memory, and better external display support. The more-affordable MacBook could come in Silver, Blue, Pink, and Yellow finishes.<br/>

The new MacBook is expected to enter mass production late in the fourth quarter of 2025 or early in the first quarter of 2026. Apple is hoping that it will drive MacBook purchases and account for 20–28% of sales next year. Chinese technology company Everwin Precision is set to benefit from the release of the new MacBook, serving as a key supplier for its casings. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/a18-pro/">A18 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">Apple Planning to Launch Low-Cost MacBook Powered By iPhone Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-planning-to-launch-low-cost-macbook-powered-by-iphone-chip.2459906/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
