<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe 26</a> includes support for automatically joining your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s Personal Hotspot when no Wi-Fi network is available, so you no longer need to manually connect.<br/>

To set up automatic joining in macOS Tahoe, you can click on the Wi-Fi button in the menu bar or Control Center to open up Wi-Fi Settings. From there, scroll down to the bottom where it says "Ask to join hotspots" and click to select the Automatic option. <br/>
<br/>
With Auto-Join Hotspot turned on, when your Mac doesn't have Wi-Fi available and is near an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> providing a Personal Hotspot, it will automatically attempt to join it. <br/>

Auto-Join works with Family Sharing, so you can set up your Mac to automatically connect to a family member's Personal Hotspot, or allow their Mac to automatically connect to yours. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/16/macos-tahoe-hotspot-auto-join/">Your Mac Can Auto-Join an iPhone Hotspot in macOS Tahoe</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/your-mac-can-auto-join-an-iphone-hotspot-in-macos-tahoe.2466110/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
