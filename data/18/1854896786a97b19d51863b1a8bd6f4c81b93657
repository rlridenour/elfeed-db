<p>A few days ago, redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gollyned">gollyned</a> asked about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1h4eos1/best_practices_developing_on_top_of_modern_elisp/">best practices: developing on top of modern elisp packages</a>. It reminded of my <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/modern-elisp-libraries">modern Emacs lisp libraries</a> post, which I shared with them.</p>
<p>While my post is roughly 4.5 years old, these days I continue to reach out to the likes of <a href="https://nicolas.petton.fr/ressources/emacsconf2015/">seq.el</a>, <a href="https://nicolas.petton.fr/ressources/emacsconf2015/">map.el</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el">subr-x.el</a> and <a href="https://endlessparentheses.com/new-on-elpa-and-in-emacs-25-1-let-alist.html">let-alist.el</a> on a regular basis. My post also <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/modern-elisp-libraries">shared some great third party options</a>. Maybe my post could use an update? Happy to take suggestions.</p>
<p>A few days later, I ran into <a href="https://github.com/p3r7/awesome-elisp">awesome-elisp</a>, which aggregates a ton of resources to check out. Funnily enough, <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-lisp-bookmarks">I had bookmarked it a long while ago</a> and simply forgot about it. On a somewhat related note, when I reviewed my old list of bookmarks, I didn't have Yoo Box's <a href="https://yoo2080.wordpress.com/2014/07/04/it-is-not-hard-to-read-lisp-code/">it is not hard to read Lisp code</a> bookmarked, which changed the way I viewed and read elisp code (spoiler alert, as a tree). I remember how well this approach also translated to languages like Objective-C, enabling me to inline more things without worrying too much.</p>
<p>In any case, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1h4eos1/best_practices_developing_on_top_of_modern_elisp/">reddit post</a> was another reminder for me to go and check out some of those bookmarks I never got to read, including the <a href="https://github.com/p3r7/awesome-elisp">awesome-elisp</a> one.</p>
