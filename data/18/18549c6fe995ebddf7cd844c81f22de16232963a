<p>In 1600, a woman named Mary Deane was imprisoned for adultery in London&#8217;s Bridewell Prison, where she communicated with her lover in a secret code she&#8217;d learned from her mother. Unable to break the cipher, the prison authorities arranged for her to be whipped and deported to Scotland.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve confirmed just enough of this to be sure it happened, but I can&#8217;t find many more details, including (as I&#8217;d hoped) the code. Still, it&#8217;s a striking story.</p>
