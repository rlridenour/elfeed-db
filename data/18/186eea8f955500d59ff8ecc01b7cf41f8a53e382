<p>I have migrated this blog to Hugo yesterday.</p>
<p>It was fun journey and I spent about 5 hours doing it.</p>
<h2 id="why-change">Why change</h2>
<p>Recently I bought a relatively cheap laptop which I decided to use as my &ldquo;Productivity Laptop&rdquo;. I have
Void-Linux installed and I only run Emacs and Firefox on it. There are more to it but that&rsquo;s maybe a story
for another blog post.</p>
<p>Long story short one of the outcomes of using that productivity laptop is <a href="https://github.com/krydos/gemini-server">my Gemini server written in Zig</a>.
When I wanted to write <a href="https://codelearn.me/2025/03/20/gemini-server-zig.html">a blog post</a> about it on the same laptop I found that I have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>install ruby</li>
<li>install gem and bundler</li>
<li>install jekyll and its dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead I could also &ldquo;just&rdquo; install docker/podman and use Ruby or even <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll specific container</a>.</p>
<p>I felt like it&rsquo;s just too much for a simple task as writing a blog post.</p>
<h2 id="why-hugo">Why Hugo</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a single native binary. Everything I mentioned in previous section is solved by just this single native binary.</p>
<p>I did have an idea to use Emacs org-mode for blogging or even write my own static site generator tailored specifically for my needs.
The latter was especially tempting but I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t go this path. Would&rsquo;ve taken more than 5 hours for sure.
I also generally try to resist Emacs power of seducing me into using it for everything.</p>
<h2 id="migration---easy-parts">Migration - easy parts</h2>
<p>Hugo has <code>hugo import jekyll</code> command which basically copies all the posts and assets into Hugo&rsquo;s folder structure.</p>
<p><code>hugo new theme</code> - is for generating a new color theme to use for the blog. This is where all the css and html layout is defined.</p>
<p>I just had to migrate all the html/css into that new theme.</p>
<h2 id="migration---not-that-easy-parts">Migration - not that easy parts</h2>
<h3 id="code-highlighting">Code highlighting</h3>
<p>Code highlighting is a bit different in Hugo as in different css/html is generated for it. I still haven&rsquo;t fixed it properly but it&rsquo;s not that
bad at the moment.</p>
<h3 id="url-schema">URL schema</h3>
<p>URL style is completely different in hugo and I had to make the URL schema the same as in Jekyll because of links to my blog
in the internet. Plus I didn&rsquo;t want to disturb search engines.</p>
<p>There is a way to define <code>url</code> property in every post to customize it but doing it for every post sounds strange.</p>
<p>Fortunately hugo allows to configure it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-toml" data-lang="toml"><span style="display:flex;"><span>[<span style="color:#a6e22e">permalinks</span>]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> [<span style="color:#a6e22e">permalinks</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">page</span>]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">post</span> = <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;/:year/:month/:day/:contentbasename&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is how I did it. <code>post</code> is the folder name where I keep all my posts.</p>
<h3 id="rss">RSS</h3>
<p>Fortunately hugo generates RSS automatically and has a feed per tag too.</p>
<p>On of the issues is that my Emacs RSS feed is shared with Sacha Chua&rsquo;s <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">planet.emacslife.com</a>.
It means that the URL to that feed must have staid the same and Hugo default path for generating RSS for a tag is completely different from Jekyll.</p>
<p>To fix it I had to generate <code>./content/tags/emacs/_index.md</code> file with this content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>url: &#39;feed/by_tag/emacs.xml&#39;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>description: &#39;Posts about Emacs - the best text editor&#39;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>---
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>it made Hugo to generate rss feed for this particular tag at that particular URL I specified.</p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>There were and still are a few nice things I&rsquo;d like to do but in general the migration went smooth.
I&rsquo;m writing this post from my productivity laptop and the only thing I needed to do is download
<a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases">hugo binary from the release page</a></p>
<p>This migration also gave me opportunity to remove all <code>scss</code> files that I used only for keeping variables in (css is now fully capable of that),
remove some unused styles and review the whole html layout of this blog.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite happy with the outcome.</p>
