One of the most meaningful testaments to Clojure&rsquo;s data-driven and lisp-powered design is the ability to use it to refine any of its transpiling processes, here SQL generation (elsewhere route generation, CSS generation, and of course its actual hosted languages, including Javascript or Java generation*). In this post I was tasked with refactoring a 3-arg function that reads from the database into a map-taking function that works with one, two, or three items in the map.
