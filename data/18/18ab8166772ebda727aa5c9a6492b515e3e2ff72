<blockquote><p>
Several claimants have been put forth as the originators of the modern tropical cyclone &#8216;naming&#8217; system. Australian weather meteorologist, Clement L. Wragge, is one of the best-established holders of the title. &#8230; Most ingeniously, he gained a measure of personal revenge by christening some of the nastiest storms with politicians&#8217; names such as <em>Drake</em>, <em>Barton</em>, and <em>Deakin</em>. Modern hurricane researcher Chris Landsea noted that, by using such a personal naming system, Wragge could publicly describe a politician (say one who was less than generous with weather-bureau appropriations) as &#8216;causing great distress&#8217; or &#8216;wandering aimlessly about the Pacific.&#8217;
