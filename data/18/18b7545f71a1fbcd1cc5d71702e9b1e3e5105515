<p>Continuing the company’s cavalcade of M5-related announcements, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unveils-new-14-inch-macbook-pro-powered-by-the-m5-chip/">today announced the new 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> powered by its latest processor.</p>
<p>But hold on, you might say, aren’t there more MacBook Pros than just the one? Well, yes, but it seems that—as rumored—the M5 Pro and M5 Max processors are not yet ready for primetime, so today’s announcement is just the base-level MacBook.</p>
<p>Apple says its new M5 processor brings significant performance improvements to the MacBook Pro, including 3.5x the AI<sup id="fnref-37060-ai"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-37060-ai" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup> performance, thanks to new Neural Accelerators built into the GPU cores, much like on the latest generation of iPhones. (No surprise there, as <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/09/charting-the-path-of-the-a19-pro/">the A19 Pro cores</a> that power the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro are from the same processor family.) The company also touts a faster CPU, revamped Neural Engines, and more memory bandwidth (153GB/s compared to 120GB/s on the M4 model), all of which contribute to its performance gains over its predecessor.</p>
<p>According to the company, the new MacBook Pro also features faster SSD performance thanks to newer storage technology, which also enables an upgrade option for 4TB of storage (at an additional eye-watering $1,200).</p>
<p>Specs otherwise remain unchanged from the M4 model, from the 10-core CPU/10-core GPU configuration down to the physical dimensions and weight, battery life, and colors: your basic Silver and Space Black.<sup id="fnref-37060-joz"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-37060-joz" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">2</a></sup> Like its predecessor, the M5 MacBook Pro starts at $1,599.</p>

If you had “Apple brags about AI performance” on your bingo card, I’m sad to say you can stack all your chips there. That’s how bingo works, right? <a href="https://sixcolors.com#fnref-37060-ai" title="Return to main content.">↩</a>
