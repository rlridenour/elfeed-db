<p>Robert Birming in a relatable post, <a href="https://birming.com/2025/09/28/the-worlds-worst-blogger/">The world&rsquo;s worst blogger</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I moved my blog from Bear to Micro.blog because, as I put it, it “started to feel limited&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;So I moved here. A place with great features for adding photo collections, logging books, writing both long posts and short ones without titles.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I have all these possibilities, I can’t seem to do it. No matter how I try, it never feels right to mix things up. And when I tried running two blogs on the same platform, it just got confusing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used to feel this way about my blog. I came to Micro.blog from a static blog that was hosted on GitLab I maintained for a couple of years. Back then, it was 90% tech-related long posts with footnotes and references. When I moved to Micro.blog, I started to struggle.</p>
<p>At first, I wrote long posts like I used to on the old blog, but writing like that is time-consuming and felt like a chore at times. I became a bit jealous of other folks on the Micro.blog&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/discover">Discover</a> channel, who posted interesting photos or quick quotes from other places online. At the same time, Micro.blog was offering podcasts, so I tried that out and got overwhelmed quickly. It felt like I lost my way. I was an Emacs-dedicated tech person who writes about Emacs, and now I was venting about meaningless things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly when (if there was such a quick transition at all), but I started enjoying posting photos on Micro.blog. I always liked taking photos, and Micro.blog gave me an opportunity to &ldquo;just post stuff.&rdquo; It was easy to do since I had a dedicated photos section (which comes with Micro.blog by default), so it didn&rsquo;t feel like &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; when I wrote long posts on the main blog section.</p>
<p>The other thing that started changing for me was the integration of Mastodon and Micro.blog. I was active on Mastodon before I went &ldquo;all in&rdquo; with the blog. This made it easier to tell myself that I&rsquo;m just posting short &ldquo;mind farts&rdquo; (as I used to call those short out-of-place posts) on Mastodon and using my blog as an archive for those. With time, and also after reading Manton&rsquo;s book about microblogging, I started to switch gears and make my blog the main source of those quick posts. Having an official name for those quick posts  - microblogging - helped me to &ldquo;allow&rdquo; myself to write short posts.</p>
<p>Other things followed up. With Micro.blog as my online home for blog posts, photos, and short descriptions of walks and meals I had, it was easy to start talking about movies I had enjoyed watching. Again, Micro.blog made things easy. I could review my movies on a site meant for that (letterboxd) and my review would appear automatically on my blog, and even get a dedicated feed. I was further inspired by  <a href="https://micro.bitdepth.org">Chris Campbell</a> after one of Micro.blog&rsquo;s Micro camps. Now I can say that the reviews themselves add an incentive to watch interesting movies.</p>
<p>Video games, another activity I spend a lot of time on, followed suit naturally with <a href="https://backloggd.com">backlogged</a>, where I try (and fail) to keep up with all the games I play. Just like Letterboxd, the RSS from my reviews there feeds automatically to my blog and gets published there without me needing to post anything to Micro.blog directly.</p>
<p>After I switched themes to Tiny Theme, which comes with quick &ldquo;micro hooks&rdquo; to add stuff like a static introduction to a page, I included my old blog and wiki in my About and Archive &amp; Search sections because it made sense to fit those there. Now I&rsquo;m considering explaining how I&rsquo;ve done some of these things in my wiki again for other people who want to follow suit, which might become yet another section.</p>
<p>But I feel like I still haven&rsquo;t answered Robert&rsquo;s original issue, that &ldquo;mixing paralysis&rdquo; he describes. <a href="https://kimberlykg.com">Kimberly KG</a> chimed in at some point in the conversation (as a comment) and explained that it&rsquo;s hard to get down and personal sometimes, which is what a blog is all about (Is it? I guess it depends who you ask), and this is yet another big topic.</p>
<p>If I was writing for profit or for some sort of a goal, I&rsquo;d say focus is important and &ldquo;content delivery&rdquo; is important, because that&rsquo;s how you get more subscribers and more traffic and more&hellip; more. But this is not why I write.</p>
<p>I still struggle to write some of my more personal posts (who doesn&rsquo;t?), but I try and push through. It doesn&rsquo;t happen often, but it does happen more often than it used to. I think that&rsquo;s one of my personal victories, to be able to tell the world my personal stories.</p>
<p>Most people who follow my blog are techies and Emacs/Linux people, and that&rsquo;s fine, but I tell myself that every now and then, there&rsquo;s someone out there who stumbled into my blog and reads something personal that hits home. I know this is the case because I sometimes receive personal emails from these readers. I feel that when I write these things, I write them for myself and for them. I love creating those connections. And it doesn&rsquo;t just happen through my posts. I write to people who make themselves vulnerable and write about their personal lives from my blog&rsquo;s email address.  They always respond in kind, and we can sometimes start a heart-to-heart talk as if we&rsquo;ve known each other for years.</p>
<p>This means <em>so much</em> to me. This is what the small web, the <em>personal</em> web, is all about. And it will always be small, it will always be just a small group of people at a time, one reader or two, who reach out about one of the weirder posts, the one you didn&rsquo;t think much about when you wrote it. It&rsquo;s hard to describe how good it feels to get a personal email from someone.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s one reason to justify writing short posts and personal posts, you know, one of those &ldquo;why am I writing about this&rdquo; kind of posts, it is this. And Micro.blog is definitely a good place for that.</p>
