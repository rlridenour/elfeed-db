My userChrome.css doesn&rsquo;t seem to be doing what it did previously, and the text in my URL-bar is far too small. Here&rsquo;s what fixed it in my userChrome.css previously:
#urlbar {-moz-appearance: none !important; font-family: Tahoma Bold !important; color: Black !important; font-size: 16pt !important; } but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be doing anything now; change the font-size and restarting Firefox doesn&rsquo;t seem to make any difference. Why is it behaving differently now?
