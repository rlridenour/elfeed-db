  <p>The app’s security is viewed as fairly strong due to its robust
privacy features and minimal data collection, as well as default
end-to-end encryption of all messages and voice calls. The app
also includes a function that deletes all messages from a
conversation within a set time frame, adding an additional layer
of data protection. But experts agree that it shouldn’t be used
by government officials as an alternative to communicating
through more secure, sanctioned government communications — which Signal is not.</p>

<p>“It’s so unbelievable,” a former White House official, granted
anonymity to discuss The Atlantic’s report candidly, said Monday.
“These guys all have traveling security details to set up secure
comms for them, wherever they are.”</p>

<p>Signal’s encryption is more than just “fairly strong”. It’s very strong, arguably the gold standard in consumer-available communications. But that’s not the point. The point is it’s a consumer application. This whole fiasco happened because you can just mistakenly add the wrong person to a group conversation, which wouldn’t be possible if the Trump national security team were using appropriate channels.</p>

<p>And the disappearing messages thing doesn’t add security. It adds some level of privacy, but it’s an additional factor that makes all of this completely illegal. But avoiding any future scrutiny is almost certainly one reason Trump’s kakistocratic cabinet is using Signal in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The former White House official pointed out that members of
Trump’s Cabinet — including the vice president, Defense Secretary
Pete Hegseth, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard,
among others — were likely using personal devices, <a href="https://fedscoop.com/usaid-policy-signal-telegram-third-party-messaging-apps/">since in most
cases</a>, Signal cannot be downloaded onto official federal
devices. This alone creates a host of cybersecurity issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrote one DF reader (who has professional experience in this area) to me today, “There is no legal way whatsoever that classified information can be communicated over the public Internet — private device, personally owned device, Chromebook, anything. It is all wildly illegal.”</p>
