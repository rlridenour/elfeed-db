    Just because we need a lot of <i>organizational support</i> characters in
    your text files doesn't mean you have to physically type them all.

    After a fun discussion with Mr. <a href="https://github.com/jjasghar">JJ Asghar</a>, I wrote up a
    mini-tutorial on getting Emacs to do some of the heavy typing for
    you when you create a /new file/… you know, boilerplate needed when
    creating a new file of a particular type.

    My tutorial covers and integrates the <code>auto-insert</code> feature and the
    <code>yasnippet</code> template system.
