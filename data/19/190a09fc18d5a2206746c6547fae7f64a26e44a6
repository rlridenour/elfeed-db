<p>I am currently hacking around with my org files and in fact macro removing quite a few unnecessary lines.  However this has had the side effect of leaving some significant holes in the form of blank lines.  Sometimes just two duplicate blank lines and sometimes more!</p>

<p>I found that I can quickly trim them down by using <code>delete-duplicate-lines</code> and making sure the identical lines must be adjacent argument is set by passing in a <strong>C-u C-u</strong> prefix.</p>
<p>So the process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>open the org file</li>
<li><code>mark-whole-buffer</code></li>
<li><strong>C-u C-u</strong> <code>delete-duplicate-lines</code></li>
</ul>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it!, the key here is the prefix argument otherwise all the blank lines will be deleted which is not what I want.</p>
<p>Of course this method would delete all duplicate adjacent lines and not just the blank ones so I guess you would generally need to be a little careful, but I know I don&rsquo;t have any of these and if I am not too sure then I can just inspect a git diff.</p>
