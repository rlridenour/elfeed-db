<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>While there are many brilliant resources available for learning about philosophy, there are relatively few aimed at a younger age group and designed for classrooms. I decided to record some short (6-9 minute) interviews with experts on philosophical topics, with schools in mind. The result is <a href="https://henrytaylorphilosophy.com/philosophy-smash-with-henry/"><em>Philosophy Smash with Henry!</em></a></p>
<p>Each video is a conversation between me and an expert in the field, themed around a philosophical question, like ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaCJts45og8&amp;t=131s">How should we treat animals?</a>’  and ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmTycj9r8Js&amp;t=3s">Are rocks conscious?</a>’, aimed at a class of 9-13 year-olds.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-53975 aligncenter" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-2.png" alt="" width="400" height="306" srcset="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-2.png 736w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-2-300x230.png 300w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-2-400x307.png 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>The goal is to inform children about a philosophical question, and present one or two thoughts on the matter. The project also aims to spread the word about philosophy’s breadth. Rather than going for the ‘classic’ topics and thinkers, we aim for more contemporary issues that can capture the popular imagination. For example, we want people to know that philosophy has something to say about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsKKB3WzAWU">what animals are thinking</a>?)</p>

<p>The project is generously supported by an Impact Acceleration Account Grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (grant number AH/X003388/1) and it’s in partnership with <a href="https://www.sapere.org.uk/">SAPERE P4C</a>, a charity that provides philosophical resources to schools, colleges and communities.</p>
<h3>The Videos</h3>
<p>For several years, I have recorded video interviews with philosophers and used them in my teaching, both at undergrad and postgrad level. What I really love about this format is that, in an interview, philosophers will often talk about the background motivations for thinking about an issue in a certain way and sometimes explain the things in their own lives that led them to a certain idea.</p>
<p>This is what inspired a video-interview format. The project was also inspired by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/the-philosophy-garden/home">The Philosophy Garden</a>, a set of free philosophy resources for kids, also based at the University of Birmingham (for more info on The Philosophy Garden, see <a href="https://dailynous.com/2023/09/13/the-philosophy-garden-guest-post/">this</a> <em>Daily Nous</em> article).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-53977 aligncenter" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-4.png" alt="" width="401" height="269" srcset="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-4.png 879w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-4-300x201.png 300w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-4-768x515.png 768w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-4-400x268.png 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></p>
<p>Most of the interviewees are UK-based philosophers. I have also interviewed a journalist on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3BjY4kHp10&amp;t=1s">whether robots should look after the elderly</a>, and a computer scientist on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A7rkmHItaA">whether robots can be cultured.</a></p>
<p>We always start with the interviewee answering the main question of the video within 45 seconds. This is always funny, and ludicrously hard (you try explaining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcBmCyktS00">whether today’s science will always be true</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmvQu1RMpz0&amp;t=6s">why people think the world is flat</a> in 45 seconds!). We then have a quick back and forth, and a ‘final thoughts’ section.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge faced by a project of this kind is attention span. It’s just too much to ask kids to pay attention to two people talking for seven minutes. We don’t have the budget for fancy animations, and so it’s hard to compete with the kind of explosive content that kids routinely watch on Tik Tok and Instagram. To address this, each video is chopped up into sections, with teaching activities written into the lesson plan (see below), to slot in between the different sections of the video. Chopping the videos up in this way also means that teachers can use whichever chunks best suit them.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-53978 aligncenter" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-5.png" alt="" width="400" height="451" srcset="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-5.png 577w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-5-266x300.png 266w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-5-400x451.png 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>Best of all, YouTube comments are turned off. Internet warriors are forced to leave their keyboards firmly in their scabbards.</p>
<h3>Getting It Into Classrooms</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges with getting philosophy resources for 9-13 year olds into classrooms is that schools usually do not teach philosophy at that age (at least in the UK), so teachers – already facing a heavy workload – may not be sure how best to implement them.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-53979 aligncenter" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-6.png" alt="" width="401" height="281" srcset="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-6.png 749w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-6-300x210.png 300w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-6-400x280.png 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></p>
<p>To help, each video comes with a full lesson plan, handouts, and other resources to make the transition to classrooms as seamless as possible. These lesson plans take teachers step by step through how to use the video to construct a lesson. Examples are <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/henrytaylorphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/treat-animals-lesson-plan.pdf">here</a> and <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/henrytaylorphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/final-world-flat-lesson-plan.pdf">here.</a></p>
<p>Each video also has handouts, to remind children of the core points of the video, to jog children’s memories, or if they naturally learn better with a mix of written and visual materials.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-53980 aligncenter" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-7-1024x574.png" alt="" width="801" height="449" srcset="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-7-1024x574.png 1024w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-7-300x168.png 300w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-7-768x431.png 768w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-7-400x224.png 400w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/taylor-philosophy-smash-7.png 1377w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></p>
<p>The lesson plans are each based around several learning activities that allow children to discuss the issues in a constructive and fun way. For example, for the video ‘Can robots be cultured?’ kids are asked to reflect on what culture means to them and are asked to design their own cultural robot. This makes the material fun and memorable.</p>
