<p>Lebanese and Israeli civilian representatives have taken part in their first direct meeting in decades, joining a UN-led committee that oversees the year‑old cease-fire along their shared border in Naqoura, southern Lebanon. The session, held at UNIFIL headquarters, marked a shift from exclusively military-to-military meetings to a format that also includes diplomats and policy officials as part of a US-backed effort to strengthen the truce with Hezbollah and reduce the risk of renewed war. Israel’s government framed the move as an initial step toward building a future framework for relations and potential economic cooperation, while Lebanon’s leadership stressed that the talks are strictly tied to cease-fire monitoring and that the country remains “far from” diplomatic normalization or broader peace negotiations with Israel. The United States, whose special envoy for Lebanon attended the meeting, has welcomed the inclusion of civilians and continues to press for both sustained dialogue and the disarmament of Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon under the terms of the truce.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/4tsOo-4azTOh2GK6RmG2vJP1LSYXZXmBFSHlGVfAC4GTOjNHfvBXC4jeT3Q6v6VuTvZnCxWB-GG81paKycg5NxZr-fPhNfZd22Xf60pGa7EX' alt='Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam speaks to foreign media in Beirut as Lebanon expands truce talks with Israel.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who attended: Lebanon sent former ambassador to the US Simon Karam, while Israel was represented by National Security Council official Uri Resnick, alongside UN, US and French participants in the monitoring mechanism.</li><li>Location and format: The delegations met at the UN peacekeeping mission’s compound in Naqoura on the Lebanese side of the border, under an existing committee that previously brought together only military officers from both countries.</li><li>Lebanon’s conditions: Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said any future economic or diplomatic ties with Israel could only follow a formal peace agreement and full implementation of the truce, including disarmament of Hezbollah positions in the south.</li><li>Hezbollah disarmament plan: Salam stated that the Lebanese army aims by the end of this year to dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure south of the Litani River so that the state holds the exclusive right to arms in that area, with verification by the monitoring mechanism.</li><li>US objectives: Washington has used the cease-fire framework to push for direct Israeli-Lebanese contact and to weaken Iran‑backed Hezbollah, with its envoy Morgan Ortagus shuttling between Jerusalem and Beirut to support the expanded talks.</li></ul><blockquote>Economic (talks) will be a part of normalisation, normalisation will follow peace.
