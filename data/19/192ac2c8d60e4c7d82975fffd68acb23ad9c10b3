<p>President Donald Trump said it was “very dangerous” for Britain to expand business with China, commenting as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited China to promote a reset in economic ties and to seek improved market access. UK officials said Washington knew about the trip in advance and noted that President Trump is also due to visit China in April, underscoring that major powers are still keeping diplomatic channels open even amid friction. Starmer highlighted what he described as progress from talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, including steps tied to travel and trade that he framed as confidence-building between the two countries. Several outlets describe the broader backdrop as allies and partners weighing closer economic engagement with Beijing as they navigate uncertainty created by U.S. tariff policy signals under President Trump.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/mfZxNUbcr-8y3hHa7AkIqmq9Dl1kqHCScdqERPQgi8_gtKJjVSXsn5w_RSk32TtN-pJL7HImDv85yLkc5hA87gTIcNZcZKDefbT29Ilotjc6W25ucDE_fyjNDd-aG9s-u2o7chgSJfTUMB9wYDMcaQ6gttJK7Rp5fdV8GXSTLB3e3oY5Osb9cYg0YOni-7qwU3QR8Q' alt='Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain toured a garden in Shanghai on Friday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Visa, whisky: Starmer pointed to visa-free travel and lower whisky tariffs as tangible outcomes he said signaled a warming UK-China relationship.</li><li>UK rebuttal: UK Trade Department minister Chris Bryant told the BBC that President Trump was wrong to argue that strengthening ties with China is “dangerous”.</li><li>Canada warning: Trump also cautioned Canada against deepening business ties with Beijing after Canadian leaders visited China seeking stronger economic links.</li><li>Europe’s scramble: Analysts cited in reports described a “race” among European leaders to meet Xi Jinping to secure investment and market access ahead of upcoming China-U.S. summits.</li><li>Parallel pivots: India and the EU announced a long-negotiated trade pact, while Vietnam and the EU committed to deeper cooperation on trade, technology and security, reflecting diversification efforts beyond the U.S. market.</li></ul><blockquote>Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: President Trump argues it is “very dangerous” for close U.S. allies such as the UK (and Canada) to pursue more business with China.
