<p><strong>Paying a true crime podcaster every time something goes missing from your house</strong></p>
<p><em>Pros</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks to the podcaster’s intrepid reporting, you get the whole story, not just what happened in front of a few cameras.</li>
<li>The content can be enjoyed by everyone, not just you.</li>
<li>Lots of 5-star reviews on Apple podcasts.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cons</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No video at all.</li>
<li>While the podcaster is a gifted storyteller, you sorta just want to know what happened to your stuff without having to listen to 8 hours of audio.</li>
<li>Weird that you pay them, but they still do, like, three ad breaks per episode to hawk Squarespace and Better Help.</li>
<li>Is <em>that</em> really what your voice sounds like to other people? Yikes!</li>
<li>The podcaster interviewed your neighbor, and he just said it’s fine living next to you, “aside from the occasional onion smell that wafts over the fence.” What the fuck, Steve? It’s called composting! Jeez!</li>
<li>Oof, did you read some of these five-star reviews on Apple Podcasts? One says: “Just an amazing deep dive into delusion and undiagnosed mental illness.” Another: “I mean, I know it <em>has</em> to be scripted because no one can be THAT stupid, but I don’t care! It’s just SO funny, listening to this Muppet-ass-sounding loser cry about his missing possessions!”</li>
<li>Podcaster completely ignored your cat.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> While the podcaster could be interesting, the cameras are the far more efficient choice.</p>
