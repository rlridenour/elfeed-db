Satechi today announced the launch of a new travel-friendly mouse and keyboard setup designed for smartphones and tablets. The OntheGo Bluetooth Keyboard with Stand and OntheGo Bluetooth Mouse have been developed to be used when flying, at a coffee shop, in coworking spaces, when commuting, and more.<br/>

The OntheGo Bluetooth Keyboard has a protective cover that doubles as an adjustable stand for tablets up to 13 inches in size, so it will work with everything from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to Apple's largest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. It can be used in either landscape or portrait mode, and it connects with up to three devices at once. There's an easy toggle option for swapping between products like a MacBook, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; so you can use one keyboard cross-device.<br/>
<br/>
There are quiet scissor-switch keys for a low-profile typing experience that Satechi says is ideal for shared or quiet spaces, and the keyboard folds up flat when not in use so it can be tucked away in a bag. There is an included 360 mAh rechargeable battery and a USB-C port for recharging.<br/>
<br/>
The keyboard doesn't have an included trackpad like some third-party keyboards, but Satechi is also debuting an affordable OntheGo Bluetooth mouse. It has a sturdy base and a soft-touch top with a simple, no frills design. There is a DPI adjustment button for customizing the sensitivity level, and it supports pairing and swapping between up to three devices. An included battery lasts for up to 67 hours on a single charge.<br/>

Satechi's OntheGo Bluetooth Keyboard with Stand is priced at &#36;80, while the OntheGo Bluetooth Mouse is priced at &#36;30. Both products can be <a href="https://satechi.net/collections/onthego">purchased from the Satechi website</a> starting today, and they come in either sand or black.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/satechi/">Satechi</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/04/satechi-launches-onthego-travel-bluetooth-keyboard-and-mouse/">Satechi Launches OntheGo Travel Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/satechi-launches-onthego-travel-bluetooth-keyboard-and-mouse.2464626/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
