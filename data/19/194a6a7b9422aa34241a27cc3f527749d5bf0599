I close my eyes and begin to type. In my mind, a mixed media of verbal and image information is passing through. Sometimes I am hearing the words that I am putting to the paper, other times I am seeing a page of writing which I am transcribing. The goal is two-fold: on the one hand, I am aiming for speed of production. On the other hand, I am harvesting focus.
