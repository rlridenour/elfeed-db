<p>US Energy Secretary Chris Wright arrived in Caracas on Wednesday for talks aimed at boosting Venezuela’s oil and gas output. The trip comes a day after Washington issued a new general license that eases restrictions on energy activity in the OPEC member. It is among the most senior US energy-focused visits to Venezuela in nearly three decades, as contacts warm and the US embassy in Caracas has begun reopening. Wright met Venezuela’s acting President and Oil Minister Delcy Rodríguez at Miraflores Palace. Caracas said the two discussed a bilateral “energy agenda that benefits both nations”. He is also expected to meet with international operators active in Venezuela’s energy sector. US officials say private investment is key to modernizing Venezuela’s oil industry and its related infrastructure. But the outreach is also happening under closer scrutiny in Washington over how Venezuelan crude is sold.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/dxwO6rrS-KgJeqbsJoQ2Vk8XlvdtvsJxzGFR0MDIGMkBvGrdd5LL6377jFHHm3fadxCitACg5tsCEDEMwRfIBPAMYkBy0sDScpFZINEO' alt='US Energy Secretary Chris Wright arrives at Caracas airport alongside Laura Dogu.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Itinerary beyond oil: Wright is expected to stay through Friday and meet local consumer-goods companies, alongside energy-sector meetings.</li><li>Energy agenda: Rodríguez and Wright met at Miraflores Palace, and Venezuela’s government said the talks centered on “an energy agenda that benefits both nations”.</li><li>Investment conditions: The New York Times said Wright urged Venezuelan leaders to take additional steps to attract foreign investment, underscoring that investor confidence matters alongside output.</li><li>Capitol Hill oversight: Democrats introduced legislation that would require the Trump administration to be transparent about Venezuelan oil sales, highlighting the political oversight risk around any deals.</li><li>Context for thaw: Dawn said the visit follows the early-January capture of President Nicolás Maduro by US forces, a subsequent $2 billion oil supply deal, and a Trump-promoted $100 billion reconstruction plan for Venezuela’s energy industry.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US embassy in Caracas: Charge d’Affaires Laura Dogu cast Wright’s trip as part of the administration’s push for an on-the-ground assessment of Venezuela’s oil sector and a broader reconstruction vision in which US companies would play a major role.
