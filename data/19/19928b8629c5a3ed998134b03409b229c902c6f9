<p>My thanks to ZenStand for sponsoring Six Colors this week.</p>
<p>Zenstand is the artisan wireless charger made for where you actually charge most: the bedroom.</p>
<p>A genuine walnut base blends in with your furniture; every piece has its own natural grain, no two are alike. It also has two MagSafe-compatible pads, so two phones can top up at night without juggling. No RGB glow. No whiny fan. Just quiet and calm charging.</p>
