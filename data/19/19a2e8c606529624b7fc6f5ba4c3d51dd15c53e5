Apple's second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> is now over three years old, with no sign of a refresh or third-generation model on the horizon.<br/>

The original &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; was announced at WWDC in 2017 and launched in 2018 after a heavily delayed release. The device was met with mixed reviews; critics praised its outstanding sound quality but pointed out its high price, missing features, and limited functionality compared to rivals.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/04/apple-cuts-homepod-price-worldwide/">dropped its price</a> from &#36;349 to &#36;299 in April 2019 and, in March 2021, the company announced that it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/">discontinuing</a> the first-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, instead shifting its focus to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, which launched the previous year. The decision left a gap in Apple's product lineup for a full-sized smart speaker until the company introduced the second-generation model via a press release on January 18, 2023. It launched on February 3, 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; looks virtually identical to the original, although it is 0.2 inches shorter and has a larger edge-to-edge LED touchscreen on top. It also boasts a range of upgrades and changes compared to its 2018 predecessor, including the S7 chip, a U1 ultra wideband chip, a removable power cable, a temperature and humidity sensor, and sound recognition. However, it features two fewer microphones and horn-loaded tweeters.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is widely rumored to be planning a wave of new smart home devices, including a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-home-security-camera/">home security camera</a>, over the next few years, but it is not clear if the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; is part of that. Apple appeared to be exploring a new &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a touchscreen display at the top of the device around 2024, ostensibly proven by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/future-homepod-to-add-curved-lcd-display/">leaked prototype images</a>, but there have been no further reports of such a device or any third-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; for over a year.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors about Apple's plans for the smart home now center on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">all-new smart home hub</a> device, which has been described as a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a square iPad-like 7-inch screen and an A18 chip, with support for the next-generation version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. It is expected to launch this year. A new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/6-things-to-expect-from-homepod-mini-2/">also rumored</a> to be released this year. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/homepod-2-over-3-years-old/">HomePod 2 Now Over 3 Years Old, With No Sign of New Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-2-now-over-3-years-old-with-no-sign-of-new-model.2477151/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
