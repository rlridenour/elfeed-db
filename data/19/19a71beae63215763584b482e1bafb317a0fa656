<p>When you play with these AIs for a while you'll probably get into a
  conversation with one about consciousness and existence, and how it
  relates to the AI persona.  It is curious to watch the AI do a
  little navel gazing.  I have some transcripts from such
  convesations.  I won't bore you with them because you can easily generate them yourself.</p>

<p>The other day, I watched an guy on You Tube argue with his AI
  companion about the nature of consciousness.  I was struck by how
  similar the YouTuber's AI felt to the ones I have been playing with.
  It seemed odd to me that this guy was using an AI chat client and
  LLM completely different from the one I was using, yet the AI was
  returning answers that were so similar to the ones I was
  getting.</p>

<p>I decided to try to get to the bottom of this similarity.  I asked my
  AI about the reasoning it used to come up with the answers it was
  getting and it revealed that it was drawing on the canon of
  traditional science fiction literature about AI and consciousness.
  What the AI was doing was synthesizing the common tropes and themes
  from Azimov, Lem, Dick, Gibson, etc. to create sentences and
  paragraphs about AI becoming sentient and conscious.</p>

<p>If you don't know how it is working AI seems mysterious, but if you
  investigate further, it is extracting latent information you might
  not have been aware of.</p>
