According to Apple's website, the new AirTag will be launching at a later date in these countries:<ul><br/>
  <li>Brazil</li><br/>
  <li>Indonesia</li><br/>
  <li>Malaysia</li><br/>
  <li>The Philippines</li><br/>
  <li>Singapore</li><br/>
  <li>South Korea</li><br/>
  <li>Taiwan</li><br/>
  <li>Thailand</li><br/>
  <li>Vietnam</li></ul>In South Korea, Apple will begin accepting orders for the new AirTag on January 28 (local time), so orders should begin imminently in that country. In many of the other countries listed above, however, Apple simply says the new AirTag is coming soon.<br/>
