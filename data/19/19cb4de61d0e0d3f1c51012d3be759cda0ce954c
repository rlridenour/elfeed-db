Apple today shared several new short video ads on its UK YouTube channel, highlighting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> features like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, Ceramic Shield, Stolen Device Protection, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a>.<br/>

Each ad is about 13 seconds in length, and they are all text-based, providing little tidbits of information about the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s capabilities. For the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; ad, for example, Apple focuses on parents and children. "&zwnj;Find My&zwnj; on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lets you view your kid's location if you need to," it reads.<br/>
<br/>
The Stolen Device Protection video reminds people that additional &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; security is available. "Stolen Device Protection adds extra layers of security for your Apple Account if your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is lost or taken."<br/>

For the Ceramic Shield ad, Apple compares it to traditional smartphone glass. "Our Ceramic Shield material on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> is 2x tougher than any smartphone glass."<br/>

The &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; ad highlights Apple's review process, and how it cuts down on malware. "Every app on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; is scanned for malware through automated and human review so your device stays secure."<br/>

Each ad ends with the tagline "There's more to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;," and they link to Apple's "More" &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; page that highlights a range of different things the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can do.<br/>
