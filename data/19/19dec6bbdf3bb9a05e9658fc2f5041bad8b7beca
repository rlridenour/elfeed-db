<p>In productivity, we worship efficiency. The fastest way to clear an inbox. The most automated way to track a project. The most frictionless method to organize our lives.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to suggest something different. </p>



<p>When it comes to your goals and plans, efficiency is the enemy.</p>



<p>I learned this the hard way last year. Trying to be hyper-efficient, I dictated my quarterly review and used AI to organize the text into a structured plan. The resulting document was thorough and efficiently produced.</p>



<p>It failed completely.</p>

<p>By skipping the struggle of manually organizing my thoughts, I hadn’t actually internalized the goals. The plan remained a digital file rather than a core part of my squishy human brain. The process of birthing the ideas is what makes them sink into your core.</p>



<p>I learned, again, that you cannot optimize the pursuit of virtue and your character.</p>



<p>Much of the tech industry has monetized us as advertising units, designing tools that prioritize engagement and speed over our personal flourishing. Choosing to go intentionally slow is an act of rebellion. It’s the refusal to live your life randomly.</p>



<p>The world will try to bury you with petty nonsense. Everyone has good intentions when they ask for just one more little thing. But every “yes” to the unimportant is a “no” to what actually matters.</p>



<p>Solving for meaningfulness means giving yourself permission to ignore the siren song of doing more. It means taking an hour in the morning to read and reflect, or taking two days for a personal retreat, even when your inbox is screaming.</p>



<p>These aren&#8217;t inefficient uses of time. They’re the highest and best use of your life because they ensure you’re actually heading toward a destination that matters.</p>



<p>As we enter a new year, resist the temptation to optimize everything. </p>



<p>Some things deserve to be slow. That&#8217;s where the meaning lives.</p>
