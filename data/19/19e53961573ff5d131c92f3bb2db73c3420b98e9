<p>As a postscript to that last item, it occurred to me that because we’re close friends,  I have a lot of photos of Paul Kafasis in my library. <a href="https://glass.photo/gruber/4efTgLWlUQaVaPqKLx3Xmy">Here’s one from a year ago</a> you can use as a reference. I wondered how Genmoji would do with “An owl who looks like Paul Kafasis, wearing a Celtics jersey, holding a basketball.” Here’s the best one, from my Mac running MacOS 15.3.1 Sequoia.</p>

<p>It does resemble Paul. Not sure about how owl-like it is, the “holding” part, the slopping of “Celtics”, or the quality of orthodontia over in Genmojiworld.</p>
