<li>12 liter capacity</li>
<li>Can hold 24 cans</li>
<li>IT FLOATS!</li>
<li>Is it Mac-compatible: Why are we even talking about this?! IT FLOATS, PEOPLE!</li>
</ul><h1>Soft Drink (Carrier)</h1><p>It’s pretty simple: a soft cooler with a 12-liter capacity, or enough room for 24 cans. In other words, it can hold a whole bunch without being too cumbersome or clunky.</p>
<p>Also, it can FLOAT! How rad is that? Perfect for when you wanna get your hands on a cold one without getting out of the pool.</p>
<p>Neat, right?</p>
<p>Which means, the only question left is: what should you fill it with?</p>
<p>Of course, you could load up some Bud Lites or a few White Claws or what have you. But we say, why not support small businesses? By which we mean: craft breweries.</p>
<p>Here are three craft brews we’ve had recently that we’d recommend:</p>
<p><strong>The Kama Citra</strong>, by Burdenhaus Brewing (Cincinnati, OH)</p>
<p>A hazy double IPA brewed with citra hops, cryo-citra hops, citra-8 hops, experimental citra-12 hops, and artic hops (citra hops but put in backward), and then double dry-hopped with more citra hops, pseudo-citra hops, citra-pop hops, and MDC (magnanimous double citra) hops, all of which impart notes of citrus and hops. Available in cans or on draft at the tap room (where it’s served in a glass rimmed with dehydrated, ground citra hops).</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Operator</strong>, by Question Mark Ales (Modesto, CA)</p>
<p>A super sessionable smoothie sour, clocking in at only 1.9% ABV, brewed with milk sugar, cherries, lemon peel, mango, strawberry, blueberry cake donuts, grape Gushers, fruit-punch-flavored Gatorade, pineapple upside-down cake, and Lucky Charms Rainbow marshmallows. 2-packs available to-go from the tap room, only $72 per!</p>
<p><strong>Massive Damage</strong>, by The Cursed Beer Company (Charleston, SC)</p>
<p>This huge imperial stout achieves its thick, chocolatey goodness thanks to an extremely long boil during the brewing process. How long, you wonder? It’s hard to say. Because it’s actually still boiling now, in the kegs at the tap room and the cans out for distribution. How is this possible? When asked this question, Cursed Beer Company head brewer Martin Castle said, “I’ve put my whole soul into this beer. As in, I’ve literally made deals with entities unspeakable, promising my soul in exchange for this amazing brew. I hope you enjoy. Though, please, for your safety, allow it an hour to stop boiling after pouring before you drink.”</p>
<p>Wow, don’t those sound delicious? And they’d all be entirely at home in your new floating can cooler!</p>
