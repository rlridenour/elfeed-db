<p>CarPlay Ultra barely exists at this point in the $200K Aston Martin.&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/31/carplay-ultra-hyundai-ioniq-3/">The latest rumor</a>&nbsp;has Hyundai putting it in the upcoming (and affordable) $35,000 Hyundai Ioniq 3.</p>



<p>We own the Kia EV6, which is somewhat adjacent to the Hyundai EV’s and the second screen in those cars will be ideal for something like CarPlay Ultra. Moreover, I’ve spent time looking at the Hyundai dashes and I’m certain anything Apple does will be far superior.</p>



<p>While I don’t expect CarPlay Ultra to become as popular as vanilla CarPlay, I hope it gets used enough to remain viable. Car makers are generally pretty terrible at UI.</p>
