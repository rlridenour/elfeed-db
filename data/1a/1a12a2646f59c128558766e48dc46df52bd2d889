<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
An attempt to synthesize four morning readings; and continue to lean into the &ldquo;value of letters.&rdquo;

        <p><time datetime="2025-01-13" title="2025-01-13">Today</time> I read a quartet of posts that rolled through <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" title="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-RSS">&#128214;</a></small>

<p><a href="https://lithub.com/defying-empire-on-the-perennially-relevant-political-message-of-wicked/">Defying Empire: On the Perennially Relevant Political Message of Wicked</a>:
drawing connections between Oz’s empire and the US.  Both sustained by
propaganda, and the encouragement and facilitation of living the “unexamined
life.”  Nothing has made me want to read nor see Wicked more that this essay and
the author’s statement that “the Land of Oz has always reflected the U.S.”</p>
<p><a href="https://lithub.com/danielle-legros-georges-on-docupoetics-the-nuances-of-haiti-and-letter-writing-as-poetry/">Danielle Legros Georges on Docupoetics, the Nuances of Haiti, and
Letter-Writing as Poetry</a>; which raised awareness (for me) of the min-20th
century movement of Haitan’s to the Congo.  Also about the power of letters,
which contributes to the thrust of <a href="https://vhbelvadi.com/relics">Relics of the future</a>; namely the historical
value of the immediacy and intimacy of letters.</p>
<p><a href="https://vhbelvadi.com/newsletter/24">The self-help industry</a>, and appreciate V.H. Belvadi’s−the author
author—distillation self-help’s reduction and perennial popularity.  Namely that
self help’s continued distillation has stripped its philosophical essence,
leaving pithy aphorisms which can quickly be eaten.</p>
<p>And <cite data-id="b53ace85-f1bf-4a5c-9823-d84d60194a27">Cambion</cite> by Clark Ashton Smith, which was posted by James Maliszewski’s
blog post: <a href="https://grognardia.blogspot.com/2025/01/cambion.html">Cambion</a>.  The half-demon; a Merlyn for all eras.  Living a liminal
life, privileged and damned.</p>

Acquiring new knowledge, about the world and about ourselves, often forces us to
reconsider long-held beliefs and stances—and can be uncomfortable even as it is
emancipating.

<p>The modern self-help’s agenda is to provide easy life hacks to create a “better
life”; for some definition of “better”.  Especially when we consider they might
be morally and philosophically bankrupt and un-rooted.</p>
<p>This is reflective of the times, which in the US, <time datetime="2025-01-13" title="2025-01-13">today</time> means echoing and
amplifying the imperial propaganda.  Contrast Haiti and it’s liberation and
education (and the colonialist blow-back that continues to asphyxiate and
impoverish Haiti) and see the philosophical and moral energy to go forth and
help in the liberation the Congo through pedagogy.</p>
<p>Can one consider these homogeneous self-help books knowledge?  A regurgitation of
already mentioned and re-mentioned information.  Ones deeply self-helping one
achieve success…as defined by the author and publisher, and thus likely the
larger systems in which wealth, power, and control are stated goal.</p>
<p>I’d imagine if you’re an self-help author, these now generally available <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction">Artificial Intelligences</a></span> (<abbr title="Artificial Intelligences">AIs</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Artificial Intelligences”" title="Other site-wide references of “Artificial Intelligences”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-AI">&#128214;</a></small>)
 are
a well-spring of material.  Simply feed it a prompt or three, and let it vomit
forth “wisdom.”  The generally available <abbr title="Artificial Intelligences">AIs</abbr>
 have been feed the systems that got
us here; encoding colonialism, racism, misogyny, capitalism, homophobia,
transphobia.</p>
<p>They shall barf forth a rorschach test from those system-supplied inks and then
parrot their word diet back.</p>
<p>Reading between these texts, I see that the letters (and blog posts) we
write—without consulting the vomiting oracles of our time—help create the
reality towards which we are working.</p>
