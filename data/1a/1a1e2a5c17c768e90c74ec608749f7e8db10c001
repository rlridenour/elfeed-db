<p>The West Bank city of Bethlehem has lit its main Christmas tree and resumed public celebrations for the first time since the Gaza war severely disrupted tourism and daily life, drawing hundreds of local residents and visitors to Manger Square for music, dancing and family festivities. City authorities and business owners hope the return of lights and events around the Church of the Nativity will begin to revive an economy where a large majority of residents depend on Christian pilgrimages and holiday tourism. The celebrations come after two years in which Bethlehem either cancelled or drastically scaled back Christmas events in solidarity with people in Gaza and because of Israeli military closures and operations across the occupied West Bank. While crowds and foreign tour groups remain far below pre-war levels, local leaders describe the ceremonies as a modest but meaningful sign that &quot;life is coming back again&quot; to the city.</p><img src='' alt='Crowds gather around the newly illuminated Christmas tree in Bethlehem’s Manger Square.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Manger Square events: The tree-lighting featured choirs, dabke folk dancing and costumed Santas handing out sweets to children packed into Manger Square in front of the Church of the Nativity.</li><li>Tourism dependence: Bethlehem’s mayor estimates that around four-fifths of the city’s residents rely directly or indirectly on religious tourism, from hotels and souvenir shops to butchers and supermarkets supplying pilgrim groups.</li><li>Economic hardship: Local officials say the unemployment rate in Bethlehem rose from about 14% before the Gaza war to roughly 65% at its height, forcing thousands of residents to leave in search of work elsewhere.</li><li>Ceasefire backdrop: The festivities take place amid a fragile ceasefire in Gaza and ongoing Israeli restrictions in parts of the West Bank, which have limited movement and deterred many international pilgrims from visiting.</li><li>Symbol of hope: City leaders describe the freshly lit tree, decorated in red and gold, as a symbol of resilience and hope that more stable times will eventually allow Bethlehem to fully welcome pilgrims again.</li></ul><blockquote>It’s not like it was before the war but it’s like life is coming back again. - John Juka, Bethlehem restaurant owner</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Bethlehem municipal leaders: City officials say reviving Christmas events is essential to restarting the local economy and restoring a sense of normalcy after months of closures and military tension.
