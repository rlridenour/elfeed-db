iPadOS 26.0.1 (23A8464), macOS 26.0.1 (25A8364), and visionOS 26.0.1 (23M8340) should be available upon the launch of the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, and Vision Pro, which each feature the M5 chip.<br/>
<br/>
All three of the new devices likely have the current versions of their operating systems pre-installed. It is not yet clear what's in the new versions of iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS, but day-one updates usually include essential bug fixes.<br/>
