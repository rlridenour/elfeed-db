<p>Eddy Cue, in a rare bylined post on Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The numbers reflect the incredible enthusiasm of our customers,
whether it’s downloading an exciting new app or game, watching the
hottest new show with family and friends, listening to their
favorite songs, or shopping with peace of mind. The App Store
alone saw over 850 million average weekly users globally, with
developers earning over $550 billion on our platform since 2008.
Apple Pay also made a significant impact by eliminating well over
$1 billion in fraud, while generating more than $100 billion in
incremental merchant sales globally, and purchases made through
Apple Pay significantly outpaced the overall growth in consumer
spending levels during the peak holiday shopping period in
November and December.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple TV eclipsed all prior viewership records in December 2025,
while Apple Music reached all-time highs in both listenership and
new subscribers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are not numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple TV’s engagement this past December soared, with total hours
viewed up 36 percent compared to the previous year, setting a new
record for monthly engagement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a number, but it’s <a href="https://x.com/jsnell/status/481863414180896769">a Bezos Number</a>.</p>
