As you almost certainly know, we here at Irreal have little patience for those constantly whining about parentheses in Lisp. They seem to us like little kids complaining to Mom that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not fair&rdquo;. Apparently, we&rsquo;re not the only ones. Joe Marshal, who I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, is an old time Lisper—so old timey that he worked on the firmware for one of the actual Lisp machines—who also doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of patience for the whining.

He settled on a unique solution. He asked his AI client, Gemini, to <a href="https://funcall.blogspot.com/2025/04/get-over-it-ai-content.html">write a rant for him</a>. I have to admit, as much as I dismiss the current AI craze as voodoo, the rant was probably better than I could have written. If you, too, are tired of the jejune whimpering from the ignorati, take a look at Marshall&rsquo;s post for some well earned relief.

Maybe we can enlist an army of these AIs to beat the whiners into submission or at least into complaining about something else. The Illuminati maybe.</p>
