If you&#39;re using i3wm on Linux, how do you adjust the laptop&#39;s screen
brightness?</p>
<p>
Most of the time, I use the laptop with an external monitor. But when
I am out, I have no monitors. And it seems no easy way to adjust the
brightness in i3wm. Being too bright or dim is terrible for the eyes.</p>
