<p>Jonathan Hoefler:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The objects in the <em>Apocryphal Inventions</em> series are technical
chimeras, intentional misdirections coaxed from the generative AI
platform Midjourney. Instead of iterating on the system’s early
drafts to create ever more accurate renderings of real-world
objects, creator Jonathan Hoefler subverted the system to refine
and intensify its most intriguing misunderstandings, pushing the
software to create beguiling, aestheticized nonsense. Some images
have been retouched to make them more plausible; others have been
left intact, appearing exactly as generated by the software. The
accompanying descriptions, written by the author, offer fictitious
backstories rooted in historical fact, which suggest how each of
these inventions might have come to be.</p>

<p>These images represent some of AI’s most intriguing answers to
confounding questions — an inversion of the more urgent debate,
in which it is humanity that must confront the difficult and
existential questions posed by artificial intelligence.</p>
