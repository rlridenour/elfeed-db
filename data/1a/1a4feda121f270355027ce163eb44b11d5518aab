Apple today seeded the second betas of upcoming iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 updates to public beta testers, with the betas coming just a day after Apple provided the betas to developers. Apple has also released a second beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.6. <br/>

Testers who have signed up for beta updates through Apple's beta site can download iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 from the Settings app on a compatible device by going to General > Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
No notable features have been found in the developer betas so far, but the iOS 18.6 update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/26/app-store-eu-rule-change-dma/">will bring additional changes</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> in the European Union. Aside from that, the updates likely focus on smaller changes and bug fixes. No new features were found in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.6 either.<br/>

Apple is also beta testing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a>, and macOS Tahoe.
