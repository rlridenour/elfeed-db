<p>Excel.
Copy-paste to create another sheet (tab) from a selection.

<p>&hellip;how do you insert a blank line? Is it Enter? Nope. Is it Ctrl+Enter? Nope. Is it somewhere in the &ldquo;Insert&rdquo; section of the god-awful ribbon? Not that I can see.</p>
<p>Oh god, you&rsquo;re actually going to have me search for this online?? Fine&hellip;.</p>
<p>Helpful Co-pilot-in-your-face-rather-you-want-it-or-not: double-click. Nope. Alt-Enter? Nope.</p>
<p>Time to sort through individual posts from someone who has Office tips for a PC version from 1997&hellip;</p>
