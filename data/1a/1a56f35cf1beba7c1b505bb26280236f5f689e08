<p>Here’s a product recommendation long in the making. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2021/07/21/ep-318">Four years ago this month</a>, Matthew Panzarino was my guest on The Talk Show and at one point he recommended Moft’s Snap-On iPhone Stand/Wallet. It uses a very clever origami-style folding design. Folded flat it kind of just looks like a leather MagSafe wallet. But folded open it works as a stand — and as a stand, it works both horizontally and vertically. Borrowing images from Moft’s website:</p>

<p>You can also use it with the stand oriented vertically but the phone horizontally.</p>

<p>I bought one of these right after that episode of the show, and I’ve been using it ever since. And every so often when I use it, I think to myself that I should write a post recommending it. I’ve waited so long that Panzarino has been back on The Talk Show five times since the episode in which he recommended it, but here we are. The thing is, I use it both in my kitchen <em>and</em> while travelling, and so I’ll often find myself in the kitchen, rooting around the drawer in which I keep it stashed, only to realize it’s downstairs in my office in my laptop bag. Or, worse, I’ll find myself looking for it in my laptop bag while I’m sitting on an airplane 35,000 feet in the air, only to realize it’s back home in my kitchen. So I ordered a second one today — which I should have done like 3.5 years ago.</p>

<p>I own a few similar/competing products, like these PopSocket-y rings from <a href="https://amzn.to/3Imv8sx">Anker</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/4lhshj0">Belkin</a>. I have no idea why I own both of those rings when I don’t like either of them as much as the Moft foldable stand. The problem with these rings is that they’re only able to prop the phone horizontally. Watching video is almost certainly the most common use case for these stands, but I do often use my iPhone propped up vertically, like for FaceTime calls and when I’m writing on it using a Bluetooth keyboard. I’m going to give both of these rings away — there’s nothing they do better than the Moft stand. The Moft stand even works better as a hand-holding grip.</p>

<p>I’ve never used the Moft stand as a wallet, but if you want to, it holds two cards. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/07/make_me_rich_on_amazon_prime_day">Prime “Day”</a> lasts a week and it’s still running until midnight Pacific tonight, but the Moft stand doesn’t have a Prime Day discount: <a href="https://amzn.to/4eLcTJn">it’s the same price at Amazon</a> as it is <a href="https://www.moft.us/products/iphone-stand-wallet-magsafe-compatible">from Moft’s website</a>: $30. Well worth it. I love this thing. (Buy yours wherever you want, of course, but the Amazon link a few sentences back will throw some filthy affiliate lucre my way.)</p>
