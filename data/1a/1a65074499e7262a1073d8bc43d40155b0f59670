A leaker known as <a href="https://x.com/majinbuofficial">Majin Bu</a> today claimed that iOS 19 will enable support for at least a limited version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/">Stage Manager</a> on iPhone models with a USB-C port.<br/>

In a <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/ipados-19-and-ios-19-new-features/">blog post</a> citing sources, the leaker said that when an iPhone with a USB-C port is connected to an external display, users will be able to take advantage of a Stage Manager-like interface with multiple apps open at once on the screen. However, he said that there might be more limitations compared to Stage Manager on iPads.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone models with a USB-C port include all iPhone 15 models and newer.<br/>
<br/>
iPhones with both Lightning and USB-C ports can already be connected to external displays, but only for basic screen mirroring.<br/>
<br/>
The first developer beta of iOS 19 should be available immediately after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/">WWDC 2025 keynote on June 9</a>, and the software update is expected to be released to the general public in September. It is unclear if Stage Manager support on USB-C iPhones would be available in the first beta, or enabled later in the iOS 19 software cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung offers a similar feature called DeX on its Galaxy smartphones.<br/>

Majin Bu has a mixed track record with Apple rumors, with some hits and some misses. They were one of the sources who accurately claimed that the device succeeding the iPhone SE <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-16e-name-is-likely/">would be named the iPhone 16e</a>, but they also inaccurately claimed that the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/iphone-se-dynamic-island-rumor/">would have a Dynamic Island</a> instead of a notch. They also accurately leaked the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-introduce-redesigned-milanese-loop/">redesigned Milanese Loop for the Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/iphone-16-pro-color-desert-titanium/">Desert Titanium color name for iPhone 16 Pro models</a>, several iPhone cases, and much more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/">Stage Manager</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ios-19-iphone-stage-manager-rumor/">iOS 19 Rumored to Add Stage Manager Support to USB-C iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-19-rumored-to-add-stage-manager-support-to-usb-c-iphones.2455901/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
