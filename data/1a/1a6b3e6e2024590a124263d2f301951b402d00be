<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-cash/">Apple Cash</a> is a virtual debit card where you can send and
receive money through iMessage. Stored in your Wallet, you can
make secure and contactless payments with Apple Pay from your
iPhone or Apple Watch. It’s also a way to receive daily cash back
for those who use Apple Card. Previously a Discover card, your
Apple Cash card is now Visa.</p>

<p>Spotted by user <a href="https://x.com/Kanjo/status/1517427755553804288">@Kanjo on Twitter</a>, it’s easy to notice the
card has a visible Visa logo in the bottom right corner. Before
this change, there was no Discover logo on the card. While not
everyone will like the addition of the logo, it’s going to be hard
to forget it’s a Visa.</p>

<p>So Apple Card is a credit card, with Goldman Sachs as the bank and Mastercard as the network. Apple definitely needs a new banking partner, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses">as Goldman is exiting the consumer banking business</a>, and is rumored to be listening to offers from Visa and Amex to switch its network too.</p>

<p>Apple Cash is a debit card, which launched on the Discover network but switched to Visa three years ago — presumably with a nice kickback to Apple to get that Visa logo on the virtual cards in Wallet.</p>
