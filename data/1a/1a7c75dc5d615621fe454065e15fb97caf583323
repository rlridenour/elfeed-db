<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499">today said</a> that Fortnite will return to the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> next week, and he offered a "peace proposal" with a pledge to bring Fortnite back to iOS worldwide if Apple follows certain steps.<br/>

"Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic," Sweeney wrote.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier today, Apple was found to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-anti-steering-injunction-violation/">willfully violating a 2021 anti-steering injunction</a> that was put in place as part of its legal battle with &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj;. In a strongly worded ruling, the judge overseeing the case ordered Apple to immediately change its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules.<br/>
<br/>
Apple must drop all of its anti-steering policies. The company is no longer allowed to prevent developers from letting customers know about options to purchase subscriptions and content outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apple cannot control link placement, the language that developers use to direct customers to make purchases outside of an app, or the style that developers use for communicating non in-app purchase options.<br/>
<br/>
Further, Apple is not able to charge fees or collect commission for any purchases made outside of an app.<br/>
<br/>
The ruling is a significant blow to Apple. After the injunction was put into place in 2021, Apple had a three year reprieve as it appealed, but ultimately the company was required to make changes in 2024. Apple ultimately allowed developers a single link to direct customers outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and collected between 12 and 27 percent in fees for purchases made from those links.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; accused Apple of violating the anti-steering injunction after the new rules were put in place, and requested that the court find Apple in contempt. The judge sided with &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj;, and decided that Apple's solution did not go far enough to address its anticompetitive behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will not be able to delay making rule changes to the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; based on the wording of the ruling, and &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; is proposing that Apple extend those changes worldwide. If Apple does so, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; will drop all litigation.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-apple-peace-proposal/">Epic Games Offers Apple &#039;Peace Proposal&#039; to Return Fortnite to the App Store Worldwide</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-offers-apple-peace-proposal-to-return-fortnite-to-the-app-store-worldwide.2456265/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
