<p id="p2">In the run-up to yesterday&rsquo;s Apple Event, there were <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/09/08/more-leaked-images-give-weight-to-apples-iphone-17-cross-body-strap" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasingly loud rumblings</a> that Apple would introduce a crossbody strap or lanyard that could be attached to new iPhone cases.</p>
<p id="p3">What followed was a noticeable amount of confusion from those in the tech sphere as to why Apple was entering this market. Now that the Crossbody Strap has been released, Jess Weatherbed at The Verge has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/775498/apple-iphone-crossbody-strap-magnetic-reaction" rel="noopener noreferrer">great explainer</a> on why crossbody straps are an increasingly popular trend and why Apple&rsquo;s take on them is so good. (Spoiler: it&rsquo;s magnets. It&rsquo;s always magnets.)</p>
<p id="p4">This trend seems to be more popular in Europe and Asia, but it&rsquo;s picking up steam in the United States, too. I personally see them all the time in London, both as fashion accessories and practical ways for people to carry their most important device. In fact, as a quick experiment, I counted almost 20 of them on my five-minute walk back from this morning&rsquo;s school drop-off.</p>
<p id="p5">The Apple Crossbody Strap is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGGD4LL/A/crossbody-strap-orange" rel="noopener noreferrer">available to order</a> now and is only compatible with Apple&rsquo;s cases for iPhone 17, Air, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max.
