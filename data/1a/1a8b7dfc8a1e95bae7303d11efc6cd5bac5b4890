<p>This is my contribution to month two of <a href="https://gregnewman.io/blog/emacs-carnival-2025-07-writing-experience/">Greg Newman’s Emacs Carnival</a>. The topic this month is “Writing Experience,” which is perfect, since I write in Emacs all the time. In fact, I am writing this blog post in Emacs right now!

<h2 id="emacs-writing-history">Emacs Writing History</h2>

<p>I do not know how long I have been writing in Emacs, but I have documents written in LaTeX from the early 2000s that were definitely written in Emacs, and I know those weren’t the first. I guess what is interesting about my writing experience in Emacs is how it has developed over the years. Where I originally wrote everything in plain text or LaTeX, over time I moved to org-mode and Markdown.</p>

<p>Writing LaTeX in Emacs taught me to view documents and writing the same way I view source code. Since all of my writing was in text formats, I could easily use version control software to store archives full of text. I began by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">Concurrent Versions System (CVS)</a>, but eventually moved to Git. I have a few Git repositories with writing, but my biggest dates back to 2009. Those early commits are all LaTeX and plain text files.</p>

<p>The oldest org-mode file in my writing repository dates to December 27th, 2010, and is titled “Beer and Pizza.” The commit message indicates that I pulled some writing over from another repository in this commit, so obviously I had been writing with org-mode for quite a while. I know, for instance, that “Beer and Pizza” was an article that I wrote for an early incarnation of <a href="https://southernoregonmagazine.com/">Southern Oregon Magazine</a>, and my notes are dated back to February of that year.</p>

<h2 id="org-mode-is-a-life-changer">Org-mode Is A Life-changer</h2>

<p>You have probably read other people’s experience with writing in org-mode in Emacs, so instead of sharing an exhausting list of all the life-changing, writing-improving things that it has brought me, here are a few bits that I really love about it.</p>

<p><strong>It is fantastic at organizing writing projects.</strong> From being able to shift around headings and blocks of text, to combining to-do lists with writing projects, to being able to create macros and include different files—all of these things make org-mode perfect for working on medium and large projects. I write everything from blog posts to podcast scripts to <em>books</em> in org-mode, and it helps me stay organized.</p>

<p><strong>I do not have to write in Word or Google Docs.</strong> The export functions in org-mode do a great job creating Word files, ODT files, HTML files, and all kinds of formats. If org-mode’s export abilities aren’t good enough, it can also interface with <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> to cover all the other cases! This means I get to use all of my familiar tools and processes when writing, and I don’t have to worry about <a href="https://lions-way-presents.captivate.fm/episode/the-word-processor-war/">awful word processing software</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Everything I need to write can happen in org-mode!</strong> I have several websites that are built entirely out of org-mode. When I need to create slides for a lecture, I do it in org-mode. When I write adventures for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, I do it in org-mode. When I need to whip up a spreadsheet to handle my household budget, I do it in org-mode. When I need to write a formal letter, I do it in org-mode. Frankly, it is so expressive and flexible, that I don’t need to use other tools for writing. It’s all Emacs and org-mode.</p>

<h2 id="emacs-can-be-distraction-free">Emacs Can Be Distraction-Free</h2>

<p>I have a hotkey connected to <a href="https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode">writeroom-mode</a>, which plonks me right into a full-screen, distraction-free writing mode. Easy as pie! This means that when I really need to get down to business and get a lot of writing done, I don’t need to switch to a new app, leave my familiar tools behind, or go through any extra trouble. It’s just right here, built in.</p>

<h2 id="no-going-back">No Going Back</h2>

<p>I’ve been writing with Emacs for decades. It is my comfortable writing spot. I honestly cannot see myself abandoning it for another writing tool, because it works for me. I just used a couple of commands to check my three biggest writing repositories, and I have approximately 630,000 words written in org-mode between them. That’s a commitment!</p>

<p>I am aware that there are a lot of people out there using Emacs for writing, so I am excited to see what others share. I’m very pleased with Greg Newman’s choice for this second writing topic.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I realized that what I was calling my second biggest writing repository was actually my third biggest. I updated some numbers to reflect another 130,000 words of writing I found.</p>
