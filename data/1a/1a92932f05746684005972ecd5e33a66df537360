The Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PkBXPoR6V">Digital Chat Station</a> claims that Apple will adopt a "roughly" 4:3 aspect ratio on the inner display in order to achieve consistency between the outer display, as well as to ensure parity with existing iPad software.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's iPad and iPad Pro models have maintained a 4:3 aspect ratio across generations. The ratio offers a balanced experience in both portrait and landscape orientation, making it particularly versatile for reading/browsing and split-screen multitasking. Only the 8.3-inch iPad mini has deviated from the traditional ratio, instead using an approximate 3:2 ratio due to its slightly taller and narrower dimensions.<br/>
<br/>
Digital Chat Station previously revealed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/">alleged dimensions</a> of the iPhone Fold, claiming the device has a 5.5-inch outer screen and an inner folding 7.8-inch screen. Reputable Apple industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">corroborated</a> the dimensions, additionally describing the inner screen as "crease-free."<br/>
<br/>
Kuo says the device will feature a titanium alloy casing with a hinge made of metallic glass, and it will have a dual-lens rear camera with a front-facing camera for both folded and unfolded states.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, Kuo says that the phone will forgo Face ID authentication, instead using a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space. It will also be positioned as a "true AI-driven phone," with the larger screens allowing for a better multi-tasking AI experience.<br/>

Most estimates put the selling price of the iPhone Fold at around &#36;2,000-&#36;2,500 in the United States. <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman expects Apple's first foldable device to arrive as soon as next year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/28/iphone-foldable-display-ipad-style-aspect-ratio/">iPhone Foldable Display Said to Feature iPad-Style 4:3 Aspect Ratio</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-foldable-display-said-to-feature-ipad-style-4-3-aspect-ratio.2454219/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
