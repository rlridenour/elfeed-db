The new firmware is available for both the 11-inch and 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; Magic Keyboard options that Apple sells for the M4 and M5 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, as well as the version that Apple sells for the M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple overhauled the Magic Keyboard in May 2024 alongside the launch of the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. The updated keyboard has the same floating cantilevered design as the prior version, but it includes a dedicated row of function keys, along with a larger glass trackpad.<br/>
<br/>
Magic Keyboard firmware updates are infrequent, and there is no method for manually refreshing the software. New firmware is installed automatically when the keyboard is attached to an &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; that is connected to the internet.<br/>
