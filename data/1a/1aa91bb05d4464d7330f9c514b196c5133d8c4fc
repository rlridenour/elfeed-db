Apple will launch its second foldable iPhone in the second half of 2027, as part of a major shake-up of its iPhone launch strategy, according to industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>

According to Kuo's latest report outlining <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/kuo-iphone-17e-still-on-apple-2026-roadmap/">Apple's new staggered iPhone roadmap through 2027</a>, Apple will launch its first foldable iPhone in the second half of next year, followed by a second-generation model a year later in 2027, which will be the 20th anniversary of the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-new-20th-anniversary-design-iphone-pro/">reported</a> that Apple in 2027 plans to launch a foldable iPhone alongside a "bold" new iPhone Pro model that makes more extensive use of glass. He did not say which generation of foldable it would be.<br/>
<br/>
However, Gurman had previously said he expects Apple's first book-style foldable iPhone to be released next year, so it was presumed that the "foldable version" he said is coming in 2027 would be a second iteration of that model. Kuo's latest report therefore appears to back up this interpretation.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable/">foldable</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-second-foldable-iphone-2027-launch/">Apple&#039;s Second Foldable iPhone Set for 2027 Launch, Claims Kuo</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-second-foldable-iphone-set-for-2027-launch-claims-kuo.2456520/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
