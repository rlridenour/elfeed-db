<p>A couple of days ago <a href="https://taonaw.com/2026/01/19/orgmode-capture-menu-inside-a.html">I found out org-mode capture sun menus can handle additional nested menus</a>. To recap quickly here (see more details in the link), this means that you&rsquo;d have the main menu for capture templates, which will lead to additional templates menus, and that menu can keep leading to more and more menus. I am not sure how many levels of these templates we can have, but &ldquo;more than enough&rdquo; is a good enough answer for me.</p>
<p>As I was writing the post above, I went back to my old blog and reviewed two of my older, Emacs-usage-defining posts, and added them to this blog: <a href="https://taonaw.com/2019/07/06/orgmode-in-files.html">Org-mode in files</a> and <a href="https://taonaw.com/2019/07/14/submenus-in-orgmode-capture.html">Submenus in org-mode capture</a>.</p>
<p>Those of you who enjoy reading about the Emacs experience from a user perspective (especially someone who started out without a programming background) might want to give those a read, in the order mentioned above. Beyond explaining these crucial org-mode methods (and in my opinion, crucial to use Emacs in general), these describe the struggle and the learning process of, well, how to Emacs correctly: from realizing an option exists (of course it exists, it&rsquo;s Emacs), through asking the right questions, to finding the information and implementing the solution.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a couple of hours re-reading and revising these posts, and reached a conclusion that many of you who are reading this over their RSS feed in Emacs would probably agree with. We, Emacs users who blog, have a critical role in the Emacs ecosystem: we provide others with ideas and questions to ask, which can later be directed to official channels, the manual, and brainstorming answers.</p>
<p>As I mentioned a couple of times throughout the lifetime of my blog (this one and the old one): Emacs is not just a program, it&rsquo;s a lifestyle.</p>
