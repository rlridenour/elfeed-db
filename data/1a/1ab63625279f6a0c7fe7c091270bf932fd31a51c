<p>Matthew Belloni, writing at Puck (paywall-busting gift link) regarding the claim from anonymous CBS sources that <em>The Late Show</em> lost $40 million last year:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nobody can know for sure. All I can tell you is what I’m hearing.
Several sources at both CBS and Skydance insist the decision was
based on economics, not politics. After all, if this was about
appeasing Trump, they argue, Cheeks would have pulled Colbert off
the air ASAP rather than giving him 10 more months in the chair.
“Trust me, there’s no conspiracy,” a very good source close to
Colbert told me tonight. Still, two other people with deep ties to
CBS and <em>Late Show</em> suspect otherwise. After all, when a network
decides that a show is too expensive, executives typically go to
the key talent and ask them to take pay cuts, fire people, or
otherwise slash costs. That didn’t happen here — though with
Colbert said to be making between $15 million and $20 million per
year, a pay cut wouldn’t have solved the problem on its own. And
given the company’s willingness to fold to Trump, there’s no
reason for you or me to think they would stand up to any political
pressure, or resist any specific demand (which, of course, is the
reason to not settle frivolous litigation…). If Chris McCarthy,
Cheeks’s counterpart on the cable TV side, cancels <em>The Daily
Show</em> in the next couple weeks, I think we’ll have a good idea
what’s going on. But for now, I cautiously (and skeptically)
believe that this was mostly an economic decision.</p>
