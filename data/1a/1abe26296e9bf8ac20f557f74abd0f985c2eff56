<p>A few readers took exception to this bit from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/10/m5_chip_launches_with_macbook_pro_ipad_pro_vision_pro">my post Wednesday regarding the new M5 MacBook Pro</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The base 14-inch model, with the no-adjective M-series chip, is
for people who probably would be better served with a MacBook
Air but who wrongly believe they “need” a laptop with “Pro” in
its name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>E.g., <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianstucki.com/post/3m3d7uv77i22k">Brian Stucki, who wrote on Bluesky</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A rare disagree with @gruber.foo here. I’m a cognizant MacBook Pro
no-adjective user because the CPU/GPU is more than enough for me.
I buy over Air for</p>

<ul>
<li>XDR display</li>
<li>Battery life</li>
<li>much better speakers</li>
<li>SD/HDMI ports</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m glad to have the option without an adjective markup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/?modelList=MacBook-Air-M4,MacBook-Pro-14-M5,MacBook-Pro-14-M4-Pro">main link</a> on this post is to Apple’s ever-excellent Compare page for MacBooks, comparing the $1,000 M4 MacBook Air to the new $1,600 M5 MacBook Pro and, because there’s a third slot, the $2,000 M4 MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip. Stucki’s short list nails the actual advantages of the base MacBook Pro compared to the MacBook Air: much better display (1,000 nits vs. 500 nits, with the MBP supporting up to 1,600 nits for HDR content), better speakers, longer battery life, and SD/HDMI ports. Unmentioned by Stucki is that only the MacBook Pro offers the option for a nano-texture matte display for $150.</p>

<p>In my defense, I did say “probably” in my post. My understanding is that the base MacBook Pro is a huge seller for Apple. So of course some very well-informed users are buying them for good reasons. But I really do think an awful lot of base MacBook Pro buyers are spending an extra $600 and carrying 0.7 pounds of extra weight for features they don’t actually notice or care about. They just think they need a “pro” laptop, and underestimate just how incredibly capable MacBook Airs are.</p>
