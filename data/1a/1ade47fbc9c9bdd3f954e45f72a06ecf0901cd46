<li>Two little trash bins for your car</li>
<li>Buckle them in to keep them in place</li>
<li>Collapse them down when you’re not using them</li>
<li>Are they Mac-compatible: No, because they come with replacement bags, and Apple doesn’t support products that come with useful accessories</li>
</ul><h1>Car You Serious?</h1><p>You ever cook an elaborate meal, one that uses a bunch of different pots and pans and baking sheets, and by the time you’re done, you’re so exhausted that you just pack up the leftovers and promise yourself to take care of the dishes in the morning?</p>
<p>It’s rough that next day, isn’t it?</p>
<p>You come into the kitchen, ready to make some coffee and a little breakfast, and it looks like a tornado went through. Or else it’s like the scene in every college comedy, where the main characters wake up to find their home covered in the party detritus from the night before.</p>
<p>Gross.</p>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<p>You clean up, duh.</p>
<p>Messes in your car are different. They’re not blizzards like big meals and parties. No, your car is more like the backyard in mid-February, when several days of 1 or 2 inches of accumulation across three weeks result in a bunch of totally nasty, crunchy snow.</p>
<p>You’re feeling a little snacky as you check out at the pharmacy so you grab a candy bar for the drive home, depositing the wrapper in the passenger seat.</p>
<p>You drive through the Starbucks on the way to work but finish your drink before you get to the office, leaving the cup in the cupholder.</p>
<p>You go on a road trip, stopping three hours in for a snack, some hydration, and some caffeine, tossing the resultant containers in the back seat.</p>
<p>None of these occurrences is, on its own, a <em>huge</em> problem. In fact, it’s debatable if any of this really even constitutes a “mess.”</p>
<p>The problem is, you get home and forget to clear out that trash. Then, some time later, you sit down in the driver’s seat, look at your car’s interior, and say to yourself, “When did this become such a shit show?”</p>
<p>These trash bins might not solve all your slovenly problems. But they’ll help. Because you can buckle them to a seat, and then you have a place to deposit all your garbage. That means, when it’s time to clean your car, you don’t have to go from door to door, checking under every seat and looking in every crevice. You can just take the bag out, throw it away, and load in a new one.</p>
<p>Also, when you’re not using it, it collapses down to nothing.</p>
<p>Neat, right?</p>
<p>So buy one and keep your car a little cleaner.</p>
<p>Also, do the dishes right after dinner. You’ll always thank yourself the next day.</p>
