<p>I was writing HTML by hand today and was reminded
that closing <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags is optional, which I learned about from this
blog post:
<a href="https://blog.novalistic.com/archives/2017/08/optional-end-tags-in-html/">You are not required to close your <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags in HTML.</a></p>
<p>It feels so much easier to just write the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag at the beginning (as if
it&rsquo;s a bullet point) without worrying about the <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>My HTML linter doesn&rsquo;t like it, but my HTML linter doesn&rsquo;t like a lot of things
and often I think I should just turn it off.</p>
