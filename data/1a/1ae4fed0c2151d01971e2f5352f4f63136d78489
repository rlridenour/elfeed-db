Marcin Borkowski (Mbork) has a problem that many of we Org users have: He likes to use checkbox lists to organize tasks to ensure that he doesn&rsquo;t forget any steps. An example that will resonate with most of us is using a checklist for things to pack for a vacation. So what&rsquo;s the problem? The problem is <a href="https://mbork.pl/2025-07-07_Mass_resetting_Org_mode_checkboxes">how to reset those checkboxes to unchecked for the next time you want to use the checklist</a>.
</p>
<p>
For a long time, he just did the obvious thing and performed a <code>query-replace</code> to change <code>[x]</code> to <code>[ ]</code>. The trouble with that solution is that it didn&rsquo;t reset the checkbox cookies so he had to do that by hand. Since he knows <a href="https://leanpub.com/hacking-your-way-emacs">a bit about Elisp</a>, he decided to write his own solution. It turns out that Org already has a function, <code>org-reset-checkbox-state-subtree</code>, that almost does that. It will reset all the checkboxes in the current subtree so all Mbork needed to do was write a function to step down the subtrees and call <code>org-reset-checkbox-state-subtree</code> for each one.
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s a surprising small amount of code and neatly solves the problem. As Mbork points out, there are some problems. His solution will sometimes call <code>org-reset-checkbox-state-subtree</code> for the same subtree more than once and it apparently can mess with header folding but most files you&rsquo;re going to use his function on are probably sufficiently small that it doesn&rsquo;t matter.

I&rsquo;ve written a bunch of code like this. It may not be ready to ship but it solves a problem and I understand its limitations. It&rsquo;s a win.</p>
