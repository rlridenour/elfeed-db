<p id="p2">Yesterday, I wrote about the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/cyberpunk-2077-for-mac-arrives-thursday/" rel="noopener noreferrer">upcoming release of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition on the Mac</a>. Today, CD PROJEKT RED published <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2891/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements" rel="noopener noreferrer">a support document</a>, listing the game&rsquo;s Mac system requirements. As I wrote yesterday, the company says the game will work on all Apple silicon Macs; however, the beefier your CPU and memory, the better.</p>
<p id="p3"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/708100/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements-modes-ray-tracing" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Tom Warren at The Verge</a> today, the support document summarizes the game&rsquo;s system requirements in four categories: Minimum, Recommended, High Fidelity, and Very High Fidelity. It&rsquo;s worth checking out the support document and Warren&rsquo;s coverage before buying Cyberpunk 2077, which still hasn&rsquo;t shown up on the Mac App Store for pre-order, because if you want the Very High Fidelity experience, you&rsquo;ll need at least an M3 Ultra or M4 Max with at least 36&nbsp;GB of memory.</p>
