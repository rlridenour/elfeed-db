<p>Venezuela’s government freed several prominent opposition figures on Sunday after lengthy detentions that multiple outlets described as politically motivated, amid international pressure — including from the United States — to release political prisoners. Among those freed was opposition politician and former National Assembly vice president Juan Pablo Guanipa, an ally of opposition leader María Corina Machado. Within hours, Machado and Guanipa’s family said “heavily armed men” took him in Caracas, calling it a kidnapping and demanding proof of life. Venezuela’s Public Prosecutor’s Office later said authorities had taken Guanipa back into custody and would place him under house arrest, arguing he violated the terms of his release — a reversal that raised questions about how durable the prisoner-release steps will be. Even so, the broader round of releases — reported to include dozens of detainees — is a concrete step that human-rights advocates and foreign governments have long pushed for. It also keeps attention on what comes next: whether those freed regain full civil and political rights, or only a temporary return to liberty.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/3FkNdMELHRYrjrePvE_tT5F4bIANvV-3-DbdQPavNJYDTyIpyMJCY5D8jDL2xYR9kFP2kFr0csH9r8UWOrI2Qo9vF7-VZ-kRnk1H1ecXFtCvHI3aYecPAv2rKAST6gQ1yoPJktESYwqbtSMNt_PSQj72oX18N3qwrFKQbUqGoo3hChjRF6KJlDBmPgob_R8xfdqQ46WkZwpNRu5wX2kghpc1' alt='Juan Pablo Guanipa outside El Helicoide detention center in Caracas after his release on Sunday; he was later taken back into custody.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of releases: At least 35 political prisoners were reported released in Sunday’s round.</li><li>Seizure details: Reuters said heavily armed men in civilian clothing took Guanipa in Caracas.</li><li>Court step: Authorities said they were seeking court approval to place Guanipa under house arrest after he was seized.</li><li>Who else was freed: Reports said the releases included other figures described as part of María Corina Machado’s inner circle.</li><li>Profile detail: Coverage of the rearrest described Guanipa, a former National Assembly vice president, as 61 years old.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>María Corina Machado (opposition leader): She said a close ally had been kidnapped by armed men shortly after his release, framing it as a forcible abduction rather than a lawful detention.
