<p>In the latest development in President Trump&#x27;s maritime anti-drug campaign, the US military carried out another strike on a small boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean or Caribbean region on Thursday, killing four people in what officials say was an operation against a vessel linked to narcotics trafficking and a designated terrorist organization. US Southern Command said Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted the attack in international waters under the direction of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, after a pause of nearly three weeks in a wider campaign that has targeted boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific since early September. The latest operation brings the reported death toll from the series of 22 strikes to at least 87 people, while the administration maintains it is waging an armed conflict against &quot;narco-terrorists&quot; and insists the actions are lawful. At the same time in Washington, Admiral Frank &quot;Mitch&quot; Bradley, who oversaw a September 2 attack that included a second strike on survivors, briefed lawmakers in closed-door sessions where he denied that Hegseth ever issued a &quot;kill them all&quot; order, but several Democratic members left saying the full video raised serious questions about whether the tactics complied with the laws of armed conflict.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ZBFUMXBQhiuYM3IPK-5x3DNaU4gz9hXF7nuYPlcIYCILBsvP8j94DAyvW__9KDkHngabxfCq0Ou_hC2VJOr0et3PfjxjwZIAfap2prKixbaOMkhwOGi0P9ObZf2f1Qxd26T6P6HhmM6p4XERyi1PgrMMiK2h8M7_FlbFOXlf5ywBbvudrdIILbss7cnP5ktx5bE3OMYQcWlVJATIkRW_CQ-fqT4_PkY5LnExGwdL7uooZpggTfsiuSaLdInw5NiJimW6zsoce2HCXH0PiA' alt='President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listen during a Cabinet meeting at the White House amid scrutiny of US maritime strikes.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of campaign: The Pentagon says the latest action is the 22nd lethal strike in a maritime campaign targeting suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific that began in early September, a tempo that lawmakers say is unusual for counter-narcotics operations.</li><li>Target designation: US Southern Command described Thursday’s target as a vessel in international waters allegedly operated by a group the government has labeled a terrorist organization, linking the strikes to counterterrorism as well as anti-drug authorities.</li><li>Congressional reactions: After viewing classified footage of the September 2 mission, top Republicans on armed services and intelligence committees called the operation &quot;highly lawful and lethal,&quot; while senior Democrats described the second strike as potentially hitting shipwrecked survivors and said they were deeply troubled.</li><li>Call for transparency: Legal specialists and some lawmakers have urged the Pentagon to release the unedited boat-strike video to allow independent assessment of whether survivors were lawfully targeted or should have been treated as persons hors de combat under the laws of war.</li><li>Legal debate: International law experts interviewed by media outlets argue that treating alleged drug smugglers on the high seas as combatants in an armed conflict, and conducting repeated lethal strikes against them, may exceed accepted bounds of self-defense and counter-narcotics law-enforcement operations.</li></ul><blockquote>What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I&#x27;ve seen in my time in public service. - Rep. Jim Himes</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: The White House and Pentagon frame the maritime strikes as part of an ongoing armed campaign against &quot;narco-terrorists&quot; and insist that the operations against alleged drug boats in international waters comply with US and international law. (<a href='https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/new-us-strike-on-alleged-drug-boat-in-the-pacific-kills-four'>The Straits Times</a>)</li><li>Democratic lawmakers: Senior Democrats who viewed the September 2 footage say they are deeply concerned that the second strike targeted shipwrecked survivors and that the broader campaign may constitute an unlawful use of military force rather than legitimate law-enforcement at sea. (<a href='https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/dem-congressman-deeply-concerned-about-legality-of-boat-strikes-after-viewing-video'>PBS NewsHour</a>)</li><li>Republican lawmakers: Leading Republicans on relevant committees endorse Admiral Bradley’s decisions as within his rules of engagement, describe the September 2 mission as &quot;highly lawful and lethal,&quot; and emphasize support for aggressive measures to disrupt drug trafficking networks.

(<a href='https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyxjd6pxzro'>BBC News</a>)</li><li>Legal experts: International humanitarian law scholars note that deliberately striking survivors in the water could qualify as an attack on persons no longer taking part in hostilities and therefore risk meeting the legal definition of a war crime if the individuals were hors de combat. (<a href='https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-hegseth-venezuela-boat-strikes-war-crimes-are-they-legal/'>CBS News</a>)</li><li>Foreign policy commentators: Some analysts argue that the controversy over the boat strikes adds to questions about Secretary Hegseth’s judgement and the administration’s broader approach to using military tools against non-state actors in the Western Hemisphere.
