Today is Earth Day, and Apple is celebrating the occasion in five ways.<br/>

First, Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/">updated its home page</a> to highlight its ongoing <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/">Apple 2030 initiative</a>. Apple is aiming to become carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. Last week, Apple announced that it surpassed a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-announces-major-reduction-in-gas-emissions/">60% reduction in its global greenhouse gas emissions</a> compared to 2015 levels. More details are available in the company's <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2025.pdf">2025 Environmental Progress Report</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Second, Apple recently launched an Earth Day promotion that offers customers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-earth-day-recycling-promotion/">10% off eligible Apple accessories when they recycle eligible devices</a> at participating Apple Stores. The offer is available through May 16 in the U.S. and many other countries. For more details about the promotion, read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-earth-day-recycling-promotion/">earlier coverage</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Third, the annual <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/apple-watch-activity-challenge-earth-day-2/">Earth Day Activity Challenge</a> has returned. Apple Watch users who complete any workout for 30 minutes or longer today will receive a 2025 Earth Day award in the Activity app, along with animated iMessage stickers.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/demo-iphones-ipads-clean-energy-charging/">enable Clean Energy Charging on iPhone and iPad demo units</a> in U.S. stores. With this feature, the devices will charge at times of the day when the electric grid is relatively cleaner, as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Apple is celebrating Earth Day with content across some other apps and services. For example, Apple Fitness+ subscribers can listen to a new Time to Walk episode featuring actress and climate advocate Shailene Woodley.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earth-day/">Earth Day</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/apple-celebrating-earth-day-in-five-ways/">Apple Celebrating Earth Day in These Five Ways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-celebrating-earth-day-in-these-five-ways.2455753/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
