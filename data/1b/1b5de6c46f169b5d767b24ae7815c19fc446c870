As you probably know, I&rsquo;m a big fan of Charles Choi&rsquo;s  Casual Suite. His latest offering deals with <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/using-casual-to-work-with-emacs-registers-rectangles-and-windows.html">registers, rectangles, and windows</a>. Much as I like the Casual Suite, I won&rsquo;t be using these latest menus. Choi, as usual, is absolutely correct about the various bindings being difficult to remember but I <i>can</i> remember that <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>r</kbd> is the prefix for both registers and rectangles. If I type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>r</kbd> and wait a second, which-key will pop up a display with all the completions. This seems easier to me than invoking a Casual menu.

As for windows, I hardly ever want to rearrange them. Mostly I just want to switch focus between them and for that the excellent <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window">ace-window</a> does the job nicely and I have it bound to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd> one of the first bindings you learn as Emacs beginner. The only rearrangement I ever want to do is to switch two windows and ace-window does that if called with the universal argument.

Of course, all that&rsquo;s just me. You may not use which-key and may often move your windows around. If so, Choi&rsquo;s solution may be just what you need. He even has bindings for using the numeric keypad keys if you have a full size keyboard. If you already have Casual installed, all this is already available and all you have to do is specify some bindings for it as shown in Choi&rsquo;s post.</p>
