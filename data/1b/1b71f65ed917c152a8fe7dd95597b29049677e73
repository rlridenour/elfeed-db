Pebble smartwatches are making a return this year, and creator Eric Migicovsky this week showed off the finalized design for the <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebble-time-2-design-reveal">upcoming Pebble Time 2</a>.<br/>

Migicovsky previewed early designs for the revamped smartwatch <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches">back in March</a> when he announced the return of PebbleOS, but the final version has a more refined look. The device features a 1.5-inch rectangular watch face with a set of three buttons on the right side and a single button on the left side.<br/>
<br/>
The watch will be made of 316 stainless steel, with black and silver design options and four colorways. The Pebble Time 2 will have a 64 color ePaper touch screen rather than an OLED display like the Apple Watch, which will allow for an estimated battery life of 30 days.<br/>
<br/>
Other features include a multicolor LED backlight, a compass sensor, dual microphones, heart rate monitoring, step tracking, sleep tracking, a speaker, and waterproofing. The watch is <a href="https://store.repebble.com">priced at &#36;225</a>, and it's expected in December.<br/>
<br/>
Pebble went bankrupt in 2016 and was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/12/07/fitbit-pebble-time-core-smartwatches-canceled/">sold to Fitbit</a>, which led to the cancelation of planned Time 2 and Core 2 wearables. Migicovsky is now aiming to bring those devices back.<br/>

Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/pebble-smartwatch-apple-restrictions/">Migicovsky complained</a> that Apple's restrictions on third-party smartwatches will limit how the Pebble works with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. He said that it is "nearly impossible" for third-party wearable developers to create an experience that mirrors the Apple Watch experience.<br/>
<br/>
Migicovsky suggested that "Pebble-curious" &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users complain loudly to Apple or switch to Android, as Android users will have access to more Pebble functionality than &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pebble/">Pebble</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/pebble-time-2/">Pebble Time 2 Unveiled With 30-Day Battery and ePaper Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pebble-time-2-unveiled-with-30-day-battery-and-epaper-display.2463393/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
