The literature on these topics is vast, but the book distinguishes itself on two important grounds: (1) The usual approaches formalize truth and provability as predicates, and the modal notions (e.g., necessity, knowledge, belief, etc.) as propositional operators. This book develops a unified account in which all these notions are formalized as predicates. (2) In the analysis of truth and provability, standard approaches use some appropriate theory of arithmetic as the basis to formalize the syntactic properties of the...
