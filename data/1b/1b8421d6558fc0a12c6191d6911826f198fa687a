<p id="p1">As I read <a href="https://www.lux.camera/iphone-16e-camera-review-the-essentials/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebastiaan de With&rsquo;s review of the iPhone 16e&rsquo;s camera</a>, I found myself chuckling when I got to this part:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  You can speculate what the &lsquo;e&rsquo; in &lsquo;16e&rsquo; stands for, but in my head it stands for &lsquo;essential&rsquo;. Some things that I consider particularly essential to the iPhone are all there: fantastic build quality, an OLED screen, iOS and all its apps, and Face ID. It even has satellite connectivity. Some other things I also consider essential are not here: MagSafe is very missed, for instance, but also multiple cameras. It be [sic] reasonable to look at Apple&rsquo;s Camera app, then, and see what comprises the &lsquo;essential&rsquo; iPhone camera experience according to Apple.

<p id="p3">What amused me was that I initially planned to call <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-e-is-for-elemental/" rel="noopener noreferrer">my iPhone 16e review</a> <em>the &lsquo;e&rsquo; Is for Essential</em>, but I settled on &lsquo;elemental&rsquo; instead. Whether the &lsquo;e&rsquo; in iPhone 16e stands for either of our guesses or neither really doesn&rsquo;t matter. Like Sebastiaan, I find what Apple chose to include and exclude from the 16e fascinating.</p>
<p id="p4">When it comes to the iPhone 16e&rsquo;s camera, there are differences compared to the iPhone 16 Pro, which is the focus of Sebastiaan&rsquo;s review. The 16e supports fewer features than the Pro and the photos it takes don&rsquo;t reproduce quite as much detail, especially in low-light conditions. There are other differences, too, so it&rsquo;s worth comparing the review&rsquo;s side-by-side comparison shots of the 16e to the 16 Pro.</p>
<p id="p5">Overall, though, I think it&rsquo;s fair to say Sebastiaan came away impressed with the 16e&rsquo;s camera, which has been my experience, too. So far, I&rsquo;ve only used it to <a href="https://youtu.be/snjaZM1KOGo" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot video for our podcasts</a>, and with good lighting, the results are excellent. Despite some differences, the iPhone 16e combined with the wealth of photo and video apps, like Lux&rsquo;s <a href="https://halide.cam/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halide</a> and <a href="https://shotwithkino.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kino</a>, make it a great way to enjoy the essential iPhone photography experience.</p>
