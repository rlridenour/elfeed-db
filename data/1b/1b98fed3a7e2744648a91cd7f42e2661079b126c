Over at the Emacs subreddit, weevyl <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1jgmw36/emacs_completion_changed_my_life/">talks about how Emacs completion changed his life</a>. Or at least his Emacs life. His story is about his repeated efforts to move to Emacs and always failing. He finally realized that the reason for his failures was the difficulty of learning and remembering command names. We&rsquo;ve all been there. You load a new package and suddenly you have some new commands to remember.

<p>
Weevyl&rsquo;s epiphany was that command completion can virtually eliminate this problem. He&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">Helm</a> user but the same principals apply to <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Ivy</a> and other such packages. When you start to type a command name, you get a list of completions to help you choose the right one. I&rsquo;m not a Helm user but with Ivy, the search is fuzzy and it&rsquo;s often enough to start with the package name to get a list of available commands.

I use this all the time and have long since stopped thinking about it but weevyl&rsquo;s post made me realize what a powerful facility this completion is. You don&rsquo;t have to try to remember a long list of commands or their bindings. As I said, it&rsquo;s usually enough to remember the package name to get a list of commands that make it easy to narrow down to the desired target.

There&rsquo;s lots of agreement in the comments. Several people have almost the same story. Others have written some Elisp to help with this and shared their code so if you&rsquo;re also finding remembering Emacs command names daunting, take a look at the post. It&rsquo;s easy to forget how much Emacs does—or can do—to make our workflow easier.</p>
