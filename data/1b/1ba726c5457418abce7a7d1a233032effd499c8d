<p id="p2">Today, Apple opened up applications for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/?cid=ht-ssc" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Swift Student Challenge</a>. Students have until the end of February to submit an app playground built with Xcode or Swift Playground. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=f0xw4t5r" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Apple’s developer website</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3">
<ul><li>No prior experience is needed. The Challenge is open to students of all levels who meet the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/eligibility/" rel="noopener noreferrer">eligibility</a> requirements.</li>
<li>The Challenge is free to enter — all you need is access to a Mac or iPad with Xcode or Swift Playground.</li>
<li>Your app playground can be on any topic of your choice. The best app ideas come from subjects or experiences that you’re passionate about. </li>
<li>Your app playground should be experienced within 3 minutes or less.</li>
<li>The Swift Student Challenge is a great opportunity for students to build their skills and create something great.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p id="p4">Apple also released a video explaining the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/meet-with-apple/263/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Challenge</a>, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/get-ready/" rel="noopener noreferrer">additional resources are available</a> for both students and educators.</p>
<p id="p5">After the submission period closes, Apple will pick 350 winners, who will receive a one-year membership in the Apple Developer Program and a gift. Of those winners, 50 will be selected as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/distinguished-winners/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distinguished Winners</a> who will be invited to visit Apple Park in Cupertino for a three-day visit, which in past years was held during WWDC.</p>
<p id="p6">for me, the kickoff of the Swift Student Challenge is the beginning of the build-up to WWDC, which is likely just four months away. It’s a great program that I know has inspired a lot of students to become the developers whose apps we cover at MacStories. Federico and I have also had the pleasure of interviewing many of the winners in the past and have always come away impressed and inspired what they create as part of the Challenge. I’m sure this year will be no different.</p>
