If you haven't heard, OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT-5 on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/07/openai-gpt-5-launch/">August 7</a> has caused a furor among a contingent of paying ChatGPT subscribers who find the new frontier model's communication style too clinical compared to legacy model GPT-4o's warmer, more conversational approach. Keep reading to make the old model available to select again in the ChatGPT app for Mac.<br/>

After just a few days of trying GPT-5, many Plus subscribers have decided they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkt8hv/chatgpt_5_is_the_worst_model_ever_feeling_really/">prefer</a> GPT-4o's personality and creative collaboration skills. As a result, OpenAI is allowing paying customers to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/08/openai-gpt-5-complaints/">continue to use</a> the prior-generation GPT-4o model if they don't want to use the new GPT-5 model. If you count yourself among them, here's how to bring the older model back into your ChatGPT for Mac experience.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Re-enabling GPT-4o Access</h2><br/>
To restore GPT-4o in your ChatGPT for Mac app, you first need to enable the setting through the web interface:<br/>
<ol>  <br/>
<li>Visit <strong><a href="https://chatgpt.com">chatgpt.com</a></strong> in your web browser and log in to your account.</li>  <br/>
<li>Click your profile picture in the bottom-left corner, then choose <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>  <br/>
<li>Navigate to the <strong>General</strong> section.</li>  <br/>
<li>Toggle on the switch next to <strong>"Show legacy models."</strong><br/>

</ol>The setting takes effect immediately in the web interface, where you'll find GPT-4o listed under "Legacy models" in the model selector dropdown. <br/>

Give it a few minutes, and the setting will automatically sync with ChatGPT for Mac upon restarting the app. You'll then find GPT-4o available in the same model selector within the desktop app. If you have an established workflow built around GPT-4o's specific response patterns and interaction style, it can now continue without disruption.<br/>
<br/>
Note that GPT-4o legacy access is currently limited to paying ChatGPT users. The cheapest option is the Plus plan (&#36;20/month). OpenAI hasn't specified how long legacy model support will continue, saying they'll "watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/how-to-re-enable-gpt-4o-model-in-chatgpt-for-mac/">How to Re-Enable GPT-4o Model in ChatGPT for Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-re-enable-gpt-4o-model-in-chatgpt-for-mac.2463163/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
