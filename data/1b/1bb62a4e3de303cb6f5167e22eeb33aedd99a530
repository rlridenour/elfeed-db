In a <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_apple_and_google_on_removing_x_and_grok_from_app_store_192026pdf.pdf">letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai</a>, U.S. Senators Ron Wyden, Ben Ray Lujan, and Edward Markey have requested that Apple and Google remove X Corp's X and Grok apps from their app stores over recent incidents of "mass generation of nonconsensual sexualized images of women and children."<br/>

X has come under fire over the past week amid reports of Grok's AI image generation capabilities being used to create images depicting women and children in bikinis or underwear. In response, X appears to have scaled back the ability for Grok to generate images in response to X posts by non-paying users, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/859309/grok-undressing-limit-access-gaslighting"><em>The Verge</em> notes</a> that the tools remain available to paying subscribers and through the dedicated Grok tab in the X and in the standalone Grok app.<br/>
<br/>
The senators argue that the "harmful and likely illegal depictions" are in violation of Apple's and Google's app store terms and that the two companies must remove the apps until the policy violations are addressed.<blockquote>. . . Apple's terms of service bar apps from including "offensive" or "just plain creepy" content, which under any definition must include nonconsensually-generated sexualized images of children and women. Further, Apple's terms explicitly bar apps from including content that is "[o]vertly sexual or pornographic material" including material "intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings."<br/>

Turning a blind eye to X's egregious behavior would make a mockery of your moderation practices. Indeed, not taking action would undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones. This principle has been core to your advocacy against legislative reforms to increase app store competition and your defenses to claims that your app stores abuse their market power through their payment systems.</blockquote>The senators request a written response to their letter by January 23.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/grok/">Grok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/senators-apple-google-remove-grok/">U.S. Senators Ask Apple and Google to Remove X and Grok Apps Over Sexualized Image Generation</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-senators-ask-apple-and-google-to-remove-x-and-grok-apps-over-sexualized-image-generation.2475818/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
