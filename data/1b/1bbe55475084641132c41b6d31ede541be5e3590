During the keynote, Apple is expected to announce iOS 19, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, watchOS 12, tvOS 19, visionOS 3, and other software updates, along with new Apple Intelligence features. In some years, there are also hardware announcements at WWDC, but there has yet to be any rumors about new devices being unveiled at this year's conference.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has reminded developers that WWDC 2025 is "on the horizon" on its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=wafsmat3">developer news page</a>, where developers can now register for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/sessions-and-labs/">group labs</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The keynote will be followed by the Platforms State of the Union video on June 9 at 1 p.m. Pacific Time. This video will provide a deeper dive into the latest features and tools for developers across Apple's software platforms. Apple says the video will be available to stream via the Apple Developer website, app, and YouTube channel.<br/>
<br/>
Both the keynote and the Platforms State of the Union will be available for on-demand playback after each live stream concludes.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, the WWDC schedule included an in-person Apple Design Awards event, but Apple moved to pre-announcing the winning apps last year.<br/>
