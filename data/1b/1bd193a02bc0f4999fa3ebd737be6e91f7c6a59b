The latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta includes imagery that confirms Apple's work on a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra, which is set to come out this fall. <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris found an Apple Watch image with a resolution that does not correspond to any current Apple Watch models. <br/>

The image suggests that the upcoming Apple Watch Ultra 3 could have a slightly larger display size, with a display resolution of 422 x 514. The current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> has a 410 x 502 resolution.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't heard rumors of an increase in casing size, but the Apple Watch Ultra 3 could be the same size as the current version with slimmed down bezels that allow for a larger display area. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to unveil the Apple Watch Ultra 3 in just over a month, alongside new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models and the Series 11 Apple Watch models. <br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that the Ultra 3 will also feature satellite connectivity for off grid communication, a brighter display with a faster refresh rate, a new chip, and any health features that are coming such as blood pressure monitoring. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-watch-ultra-3-display-size/">iOS 26 Beta Reveals Apple Watch Ultra 3 Display Size</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-beta-reveals-apple-watch-ultra-3-display-size.2462834/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
