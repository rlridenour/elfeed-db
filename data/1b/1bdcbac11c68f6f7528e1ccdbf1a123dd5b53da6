<p id="p4">Albums is the infinite, high-tech CD binder or vinyl crate you wish you&rsquo;d had in high school. Relive the glory days of the iPod with album shuffle, and use robust tagging and filtering options to build the album collections of your dreams&mdash;you can even tag music not in your library to check out later.</p>
<p id="p5">Beyond playback and organization, Albums is packed with features to enrich your musical life; the Release Feed keeps track of new and upcoming music from artists and record labels in your library; the app tracks your play history and generates regular listening reports; and the Insights tab offers dozens of personalized collections to help you experience your library in a new way.</p>
<p id="p6">Albums is deeply integrated with iOS system features, including comprehensive Shortcuts support, a first-class CarPlay app, and interactive widgets. It is available for iOS and iPadOS, with a macOS app on the horizon. Coming up on six years of iterative improvement on the App Store, the app is the best it&rsquo;s ever been&mdash;and only getting better.</p>
<p id="p7">When you&rsquo;re ready to level up your music-listening experience,&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/redeem?ctx=offercodes&amp;id=1469948986&amp;code=MSWWDC" rel="noopener noreferrer">redeem your two-week trial</a>&nbsp;of Albums Premium.
