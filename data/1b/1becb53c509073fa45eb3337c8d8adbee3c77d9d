Apple customers have discovered that the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models Apple has out for display at its retail locations have scratching in the area of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charger. Those devices are handled by hundreds to thousands of people a day and are also attached to proprietary metal charging stands, so it's been unclear if <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models owned by customers will see the same issues.<br/>

YouTuber JerryRigEverything did a scratch test over the weekend, and his results suggest there is an area of the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; that's vulnerable to scratching, but it's not where <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> iPhones are seeing damage.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models are made from aluminum this year, and Apple uses an anodization process to add color. The process provides a strong, scratch resistant finish that is similar to sapphire in terms of hardness. It's not easily scratched, and JerryRigEverything demonstrated that most of the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;'s shell is going to hold up well against minor scratches, including the area where the Ceramic Shield 2 cutout is located for &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Most</em> is the key word when it comes to testing, because there is a vulnerable area. The camera plateau has a sharp, raised edge that is not chamfered, and it is a weak spot where the anodized layer is not well-adhered. The aluminum coating in the camera area does scratch easily.<br/>
<br/>
Items typically found in a pocket, like keys and coins, did not cause damage anywhere on the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;, except at the edges of the camera plateau.<br/>
<br/>
The scratch test results suggest that &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; owners won't have to worry about the kind of scratching seen on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models in Apple retail stores, but the camera is an area of concern. It is likely to get scratched, so if you're worried about that, you might want to use a case to prevent it. The coating on the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models is thin, so more significant drops could cause damage in other areas.<br/>
<br/>
Apple doesn't use the same anodization process for the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; as it does for the aluminum &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models. Apple has described its titanium coating process in the past, and it uses Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) to deposit a thin layer of colored titanium on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. It's possible the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is more vulnerable than the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;, though it is looking like the scratched models in retail stores may have been damaged <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-scratchgate.2466658/post-34170339">by the metal on the chargers</a> that Apple uses.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-17-Pro">iPhone 17 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/23/iphone-17-pro-scratch-test/">iPhone 17 Pro is Vulnerable to Scratching, But Not Where You Might Think</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-is-vulnerable-to-scratching-but-not-where-you-might-think.2467292/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
