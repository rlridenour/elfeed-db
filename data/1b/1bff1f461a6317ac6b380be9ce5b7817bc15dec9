<p id="p2">It&rsquo;s been 10 years since Apple Music launched the summer following <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-acquires-beats-news-recap/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s acquisition of Beats</a>. To mark the anniversary, Apple has made several announcements.</p>
<p id="p3">First of all, the company will soon open a 15,000 square foot multi-use campus in Culver City, California. According to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-music-celebrates-10-years-with-the-launch-of-a-new-global-hub-for-artists/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  &hellip;the new studio represents a major milestone in Apple&rsquo;s continued mission to support artists at every level by giving them the tools, platform, and creative freedom to tell their stories in entirely new ways. More than just a studio in the traditional sense, the new space is a creative campus that reflects a decade of Apple Music&rsquo;s commitment to high-quality sound, authentic storytelling, and artist-first experiences.

<p id="p6">The facility includes two radio studios for Apple Music Radio, with Spatial Audio playback and adaptable configurations to accommodate interviews, performances, and more. Apple has also built a 4,000 square foot soundstage for live performances, multicam recording, events, and screenings. Other spaces are dedicated to Spatial Audio mixing, social media production, and isolation booths for songwriters, podcasters, and interviewers. Apple&rsquo;s new California studio is designed to anchor its other locations that include New York, Tokyo, Berlin, Paris, and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-music-sessions-kicks-off-with-carrie-underwood-and-tenille-townes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nashville</a>.</p>
<p id="p7">Apple is also celebrating its 10th anniversary with a series of events on <a href="http://apple.co/_Radio" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Music Radio</a>. <strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Be Boring: The Birth of Apple Music Radio with Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden&rdquo;</strong> has concluded, but you can still catch:</p>
<ul id="ul8"><li><strong>&ldquo;10 Years of Apple Music&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;featuring stories of big moments from the past decade which will air today from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. PST; and</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Live: 10 Years Of Apple Music&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;from 4 to 7 p.m. PST, which will be hosted by Lowe and Darden and feature the artists who have been integral to the service.</li>
</ul><p id="p9">Apple Music Radio will also be counting down its 500 most streamed songs over the past decade, with 100 songs featured each day, culminating in the top 100 songs, which will stream on July 5th.</p>

<p id="p11">Finally, Apple is rolling out individual <strong>Replay All Time</strong> playlists to its subscribers, which aggregates your most streamed songs from the past 10 years. The playlist hasn&rsquo;t appeared for me yet, but I know Federico has it, so I expect it will show up for most subscribers soon.</p>
<p id="p12">I&rsquo;ve been a subscriber of Apple Music since day one. While I&rsquo;ve leveled my fair share of criticisms of the service over that time, it says a lot that I&rsquo;ve stuck with it for a full decade. There&rsquo;s always room to improve, but I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve had Apple Music as the soundtrack to my everyday life for so long. Ten years is a big milestone for anything, and judging from where things stand today, Apple Music has a bright future ahead of it.</p>
