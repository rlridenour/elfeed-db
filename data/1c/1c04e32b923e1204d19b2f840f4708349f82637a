<p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is rejecting calls to resign after renewed scrutiny of his decision to appoint former Labour heavyweight Peter Mandelson as the U.K. ambassador to the United States, following fresh attention on Mandelson’s past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The pressure rose further when Anas Sarwar, leader of Scottish Labour, publicly urged Starmer to step down, warning the Westminster scandal could overshadow politics ahead of Scotland’s parliamentary election in May. Starmer has leaned on cabinet backing as senior Downing Street staff have resigned in quick succession. Chief of staff Morgan McSweeney said he was responsible for advising the Mandelson appointment, and communications director Tim Allan stepped down soon after. Several outlets report Starmer apologized to Labour lawmakers for the damage and told MPs he would not “walk away,” but critics inside and outside the party are still questioning whether he can hold authority through the May elections across parts of the U.K.. The episode has sharpened questions about trust, vetting, and how senior appointments are handled. Some Labour figures, though, argue that visible accountability—resignations and a public airing of concerns—could help rebuild standards over time, even if the political stakes remain high right now.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/oNlNFl7uwOcCgph1OGNRbEJ34VxBsWY53-rYDccjol1IY2jMOXBUE9wYZZpP1a2K2tGJJVyd9L9kmaCz1n18Yo3GeqsL3LqB6H1hC62RaC0IPfJL52Y83lGFgNK1iu4wkJutcNwYTsN30OZ4NxgLQ_7v_ncMvjszAqKPH2zlmrDH_pSnF3etlIgJWfF5xZ4G-3G5RJg' alt='UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer during the political fallout over the Mandelson appointment.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scotland pressure: Alongside urging Starmer to quit, Sarwar has also had to respond to a resurfaced post describing Mandelson as an “old friend” after an April meeting.
