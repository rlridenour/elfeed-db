Apple says the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max displays are all protected by the latest-generation Ceramic Shield material, which is advertised as being "2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone."<br/>
<br/>
In the new "Trust Issues" ad, a father hands his iPhone to a stranger and asks them to take a photo of his family at a carnival. Unfortunately, the stranger drops the iPhone, leading to a moment of suspense given the device might have been damaged. However, the display glass remains intact due to the Ceramic Shield.<br/>
<br/>
"Relax, it's iPhone 16," the video description concludes.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, your mileage may vary.<br/>

Apple introduced the Ceramic Shield on all iPhone 12 models, and it has continued to improve the glass-ceramic material's formulation over the years.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ceramic-shield/">Ceramic Shield</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16">iPhone 16 (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-16-trust-issues-ad/">iPhone 16 Ad Highlights a Key Advantage Over Android Smartphones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-ad-highlights-a-key-advantage-over-android-smartphones.2455895/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
