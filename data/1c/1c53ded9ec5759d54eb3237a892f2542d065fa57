Several current and former TSMC employees have been accused of stealing proprietary information related to the company's 2-nanometer chip process, which is expected to debut in Apple's A20 chip for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> lineup (via the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ad9d7b68-3654-426d-90ea-332713a7b2c6"><em>Financial Times</em></a>).<br/>

TSMC is Apple's sole chip supplier. It today disclosed that it has identified and acted upon an internal security breach involving attempts to exfiltrate trade secrets concerning its next-generation 2-nanometer process technology. <br/>
<br/>
TSMC referred the matter to Taiwanese authorities, resulting in the arrest of three individuals, including a current engineer, a former employee, and a third suspect whose connection to the company was not disclosed. TSMC uncovered the situation by noticing "unusual access patterns" within the company's internal system related to "critical" information about 2-nanometer chip development and production. <br/>
<br/>
According to TSMC's official roadmap, the 2-nanometer node offers considerable gains in both performance and energy efficiency. The node introduces nanosheet transistor architecture, replacing the FinFET design used in prior generations.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC claims this shift will enable a 10% to 15% speed improvement or a 25% to 30% reduction in power consumption compared to 3-nanometer, with similar or better density. Apple is widely expected to adopt the 2-nanometer process for the "A20" chip, which will likely be used across next year's &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; lineup. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/taiwan/">Taiwan</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/alleged-theft-of-chip-tech-for-a20-chip/">Employees Arrested Over Alleged Theft of Chip Tech for Apple A20 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/employees-arrested-over-alleged-theft-of-chip-tech-for-apple-a20-chip.2462823/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
