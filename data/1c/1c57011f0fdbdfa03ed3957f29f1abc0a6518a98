<p>South Korean prosecutors have asked a Seoul court to sentence former President Yoon Suk Yeol to death in an insurrection case tied to his short-lived declaration of martial law in December 2024. Prosecutors argued the decree—and the deployment of troops to key state institutions including parliament—amounted to a grave attack on the constitutional order and public freedoms. Yoon has denied wrongdoing, saying he acted within presidential powers and portraying the move as a response to political deadlock and alleged hostile forces in the opposition. The case is being closely watched as a stress test of democratic safeguards, with the original decree quickly reversed by lawmakers after public backlash.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/jqHsCpKO5LoLRZ8uT0MnpTD2NmTIL71QaBe8TnTwxhI3um-fPl_o8Px-ZWc0XACy-yGBlHSYzqr8TWGDcCeBy6MMRI7QSKmujz2ap-DDOBmJ' alt='South Korea’s impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol at a hearing in Seoul in January 2025 (file photo).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Closing hearing: The trial’s final hearing at Seoul Central District Court ran late, with prosecutors making their capital-punishment request and Yoon delivering lengthy final remarks afterward.</li><li>Second defendant: Prosecutors also asked for a life sentence for former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun in connection with the same martial law episode.</li><li>Courtroom scene: Reports described a packed public gallery with Yoon supporters reacting loudly during proceedings, highlighting how polarized the case remains.</li><li>Martyr concern: Some observers cautioned that executing Yoon could elevate him as a symbolic figure to supporters, potentially deepening political division even after a verdict.</li><li>Defense strategy: Yoon’s lawyers argued he was being wrongly condemned, even likening his situation to historical figures such as Galileo Galilei and Giordano Bruno.</li></ul><blockquote>The majority does not always reveal the truth, - Yoon Suk Yeol’s defence team</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>South Korean prosecutors (special prosecutor team): They told the court Yoon led an insurrection that damaged constitutional order, sought the toughest punishment, and argued there were no mitigating circumstances given what they described as a lack of remorse.
