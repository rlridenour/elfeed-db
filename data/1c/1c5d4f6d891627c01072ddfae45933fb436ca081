<p>Asked whether he could summarize the lessons of history in a short book, Columbia historian Charles Beard said he could do it in four sentences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad with power.</li>
<li>The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small.</li>
<li>The bee fertilizes the flower it robs.</li>
<li>When it is dark enough, you can see the stars.</li>
</ol>
