<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says he told President Donald Trump he “meant what I said” about his Davos speech, pushing back on claims from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that Carney had walked the remarks back during a phone call. The episode follows Carney’s Davos message warning of a “rupture” in the postwar order and criticizing “American hegemony,” which became a fresh flashpoint in U.S.-Canada relations. Carney framed Canada’s response as economic resilience, saying Ottawa plans to diversify trade beyond the U.S. through new agreements, even as both sides keep lines of communication open.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/W7mUvdl4VAfnNALLTPqNn6cYCKenpVLTee0ORi5V5_cmUzf622FnZkWofChM6tYgIJJ8eFizByOk-CJ0cwp5Vg-gj52fFfNP1gw1UmSVDOeOaXBbvMaX9_kenfjIqGZoiTDn-R7kG-z4HrOlPrUSdioyttuRGRGUEH_Q8sY6jCUYTSccekoPmbgULRhZC0U2rYurMXwV6RGDvaFLlGv1uEJk' alt='Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney during the latest round of U.S.-Canada trade tensions.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Trade diversification: Carney said Canada intends to reduce reliance on the U.S. by pursuing about a dozen new trade deals, presenting it as a practical hedge against policy uncertainty.</li><li>Bessent account: Bessent told Fox News that Carney “was very aggressively walking back” parts of his Davos remarks, a characterization Carney publicly rejected.</li><li>Davos framing: Carney’s speech described a “rupture” in the old order and criticized “American hegemony” without naming Trump directly, drawing global attention and a sharper political contrast with Washington.</li><li>Political bounce: Polling cited by Time indicated Carney’s support rose after Davos, while President Trump’s approval slipped further from already negative territory, suggesting the dispute is also resonating domestically.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prime Minister Mark Carney: Carney says he did not retract his Davos message and told President Trump he stands by it, while emphasizing a plan to diversify Canada’s trade ties.
