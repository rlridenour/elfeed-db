    While awfully early for folks like me in the Pacific Timezone, I really enjoyed <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2019/">EmacsConf 2019</a> (I’ve never attended a conference in my pajamas before). My talk was plagued with technical issues, and I’m sure it came across pretty disjointed. I am planning on re-recording this talk and putting it up on YouTube.

    I have written a <a href="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-transcript.html">transcript of the slides for my presentation</a>, as well as a <a href="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-part-deux.html">lengthy essay on the project</a>. The project is only for interested tinkerers as it is really just a proof-of-concept, but if you’d like to play, pop over to <a href="http://gitlab.com/howardabrams/emacs-piper">emacs-piper project</a> on Gitlab.
