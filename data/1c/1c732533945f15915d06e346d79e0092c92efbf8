<blockquote>
  <p>Two weeks ago, there was a court order in the Apple vs Epic case
that forced Apple to allow developers to circumvent in-app
purchases (IAP). As of April 30th 2025, developers were finally
allowed to send customers in the United States to an external
website to complete the purchases, and thus avoid the 30% fee that
App Store takes. We quickly released <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/introducing-web-paywall-buttons/">Web Purchase Buttons</a>
that, combined with our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/billing/">Web Billing</a> product, create a
seamless way for developers to drive purchasers out of their app
to the web for check out.</p>

<p>IAP in the US is a $52B market, representing about half of all App
Store revenue, and this is the first time that Apple has opened up
such a major market to web purchasing. Previously, similar court
orders have been limited to much smaller markets. It has been much
debated over the years how much, or even if, this new-found
freedom would help developers make more money. The only real way
to know is to run a test, so we took this opportunity to run the
biggest open test of web purchases in history.</p>

<p>Last week, we deployed an experiment on Dipsea (the app we
acquired last year as a testing-ground) and we’re excited to share
initial results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The initial conversion rate for IAP was around 28%; the conversion rate for the link-out web flow was just 18%. That’s a notable drop-off.</p>

<p>I don’t find it surprising at all though. IAP really is more convenient. Apple’s built a great system, and they don’t need exclusivity to keep users preferring it, and thus keep developers using it.</p>
