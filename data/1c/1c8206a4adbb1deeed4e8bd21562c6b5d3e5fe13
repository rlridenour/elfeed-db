<p>This is of interest because of how <em>Political Philosophy </em>got its start. Briefly, in 2023 the publishing firm Wiley threatened to fire Robert Goodin from his position as editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Political Philosophy </em>unless he agreed to publish more articles in it to make it more profitable, a move which spectacularly backfired, resulting in the dissolution of the <em>Journal of Political Philosophy </em>and the creation of a new, open-access journal run by the same editorial team: <em>Political Philosophy</em>. The story is recounted <a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/01/12/solidarity-among-philosophers-leads-to-new-journal-political-philosophy/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Professor Goodin has written to share what the journal&#8217;s done during its first year. He says:</p>
