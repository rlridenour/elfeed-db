<p>What is the institutional future of philosophy?<span id="more-55399"></span></p>
<p>Various demographic, economic, and technological developments raise concerns about the long term survival of traditional institutions of higher education, and over the past decade or so we&#8217;ve seen many colleges and universities reduce their philosophy offerings, or eliminate philosophy programs entirely.</p>
<p>These changes may prompt us to ask whether serious philosophical research and teaching is going to continue to thrive beyond the campuses of the most elite universities, and if so, how?</p>
<p>A team of researchers have recently embarked on a project to take up this question. The project is led by <a href="https://www.afbeavers.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony Beavers</a> (Visiting Associate Researcher and Adjunct Professor of Cognitive Science, Indiana University; Professor of Philosophy Emeritus, University of Evansville) and includes <a href="https://www.jjay.cuny.edu/faculty/catherine-kemp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catherine Kemp</a> (Associate Professor, Philosophy, John Jay College CUNY), <a href="https://philpeople.org/profiles/corey-mccall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corey McCall</a> (Elmira College), <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/~psuber/wiki/Peter_Suber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Suber</a> (Professor of Philosophy Emeritus, Earlham College; Senior Advisor on Open Access, Harvard University), <a href="https://provost.washu.edu/people/mark-valenzuela/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Valenzuela</a> (Project Manager, Academic Compliance and Accreditation, Washington University in St. Louis), and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/dweinberger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Weinberger</a> (Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society).</p>
<p>In the following guest post, Professors Beavers, Kemp, Suber, and Valenzuela describe their project and as well as opportunities for others to become involved with it.</p>

<p>As regular readers of <em>Daily Nous</em> know, academic philosophy has seen significant losses in the form of budget cuts, faculty layoffs, closed departments, dropped majors, narrowed curricula, and <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/10/15/the-plummeting-philosophy-major-in-the-us-guest-post/">declining enrollments</a>. Philosophers are aware of these losses anecdotally as well as through trackers like the one <a href="https://dailynous.com/category/cuts-and-threats-to-philosophy-programs/">here</a> at the <em>Daily Nous</em>, among others.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to document the defunding and shrinkage of academic philosophy in the United States. This project will go beyond anecdotes to trends, and quantify the cuts to the field in the past several decades, primarily in the United States.</p>
<p>We aim to release an open-access report of the results in the fall of 2026.</p>
<p>We are a group of academics, mostly philosophers, with nearly a century of collective college and university teaching experience. We’re greatly concerned by cutbacks to institutional philosophy in the US, and began meeting in October 2022 to think about new ways to support the teaching and study of philosophy.</p>
<p>Our discussions keep pointing in two directions&#8212;first to the need to document the problem, and second to the need for an alternative and complementary institutional home for philosophy.</p>
<p>We’re tentatively calling that complementary institutional home an Independent Philosophy Institute. The core idea is for a nonprofit organization to offer small, online philosophy seminars across a wide range of topics, texts, figures, periods, movements, and cultures. It would be administered primarily by philosophers, and exist outside conventional colleges and universities, not subject to their budgets, curricula, staffing levels, or enrollment expectations.</p>
<p>Our hope, perhaps after a start-up period, is that the Institute’s faculty could be paid and students could earn transferable credits. (We realize that not all faculty will need to be paid and not all students will need credit.) A related hope is that many or most of its courses would be free of charge, even if it charged tuition for other courses to raise revenue to pay teachers and cover basic operating expenses. The idea is still in the planning stage, and we’re thinking hard about finances, quality control, curriculum, accreditation, governance, and infrastructure, among other central issues.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re hoping to hear from members of the discipline interested in our research project or deliberations about the future of philosophy. You can find out more by visiting our website, <a href="https://www.futureofphilosophy.org/welcome">here</a>, where you will find instructions for signing up to our mailing list, forms for volunteering, and a sign-up page to participate in an important data-gathering survey.</p>
<p>Philosophy lives in its conversations among scholars, students, and teachers. When its figures, texts, topics, periods, cultures, and movements disappear from traditional institutional curricula, philosophy itself is at risk of disappearing. We want to find a way to preserve it.
