<p>Mark Gurman, reporting at Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. has expanded the job of hardware chief John Ternus to
include design work, solidifying his status as a leading contender
to eventually succeed Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook.</p>

<p>Cook, who has led Apple since 2011 and turned 65 in November,
quietly tapped Ternus to manage the company’s design teams at the
end of last year, according to people with knowledge of the
matter. That widens Ternus’ role to add one of the company’s most
critical functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/2014413622294790610">And on Twitter/X</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ternus is now the “executive sponsor” of Apple’s design team,
representing the critical function on Apple’s executive team. The
move was under-the-radar: on paper, the teams report to Tim Cook
despite Ternus’s role.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s to hoping Ternus is as pissed as the rest of us are about MacOS 26 Tahoe.</p>
