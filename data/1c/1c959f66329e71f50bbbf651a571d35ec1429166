Starting today, the Apple Maps app on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac now displays Indigenous lands in Australia and New Zealand, such as reserves and protected areas.<br/>

In a <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/newsroom/2025/03/apple-deepens-community-initiatives-in-australia-and-aotearoa-new-zealand/">press release</a>, Apple said the mapping updates were informed by Indigenous peoples, cartographers, language holders, and others in each country.<br/>
<br/>
In Australia, Apple said it referenced language data published by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.<br/>
<br/>
In New Zealand, Apple said it collaborated with local Māori tribes and Indigenous cartographers to develop detailed place cards and map icons for Indigenous lands in the country. The place cards feature information about the local area, and communities can update them with destinations, photos, and text in their own languages.<br/>
<br/>
The mapping updates are available now, with no software updates required.<br/>
