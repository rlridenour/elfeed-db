AT&T <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2025/wireless-account-lock.html">today said</a> that customers can activate Wireless Account Lock, a new feature that will prevent unauthorized changes to a wireless account. With Account Lock turned on, account changes like billing updates and wireless number transfers are disabled.<br/>

Account Lock will protect AT&T users from SIM swapping, a technique that scammers employ to gain control of a smartphone user's phone number, and by extension, two-factor verification codes sent to that number. With SIM swapping, an attacker calls the carrier's support staff, pretends to be the smartphone user, and asks for a number transfer.<br/>
<br/>
Postpaid AT&T customers can activate Wireless Account Lock from the myAT&T app. Locked features will not be accessible until the Wireless Account Lock is disabled in the app, requiring physical control for access. Here's what Account Lock prevents:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Upgrading a device</li><br/>
 	<li>Changing a SIM card or eSIM</li><br/>
 	<li>Initiating a phone number transfer</li><br/>
 	<li>Adding a new line</li><br/>
 	<li>Changing billing information</li><br/>
 	<li>Changing authorized users</li><br/>
 	<li>Changing phone numbers</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
There are also account locking features for enterprise customers and prepaid AT&T users.<br/>

AT&T says that it will never call or text subscribers to ask them to turn off the Wireless Account Lock feature.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/01/account-lock-sim-swapping/">AT&amp;T Launches Account Lock to Combat SIM Swapping Scams</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/at-t-launches-account-lock-to-combat-sim-swapping-scams.2460027/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
