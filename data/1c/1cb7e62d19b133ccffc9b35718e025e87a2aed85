<p>I&rsquo;ve published a repo of <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/git-commands">my own Git commands and aliases</a>. Most of these
commands started as aliases and then got more complex.</p>

<p>All of the commands are described in the README. They&rsquo;re nothing
terribly complex, but I find them all useful almost every time I use
Git.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also included my collection of aliases. You can include the whole
file and get all of my aliases, or just cherry pick the ones you want to
use into your own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitconfig</code>. Hint: if you include a file at the top
of your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitconfig</code>, any aliases you define after it will override the
ones in the file.</p>

<p>Anyway, just thought I&rsquo;d share. Writing Git commands is really easy, so
if there are any tasks you repeat often that are more complex than an
alias, I recommend making a stylish Git command. All you have to do is
write a script and name it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git-COMMAND</code>. Make it executable and put it
in your PATH, and then you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git COMMAND ARGS</code> with it, extending
Git&rsquo;s command set with your own creations (and keeping your scripts
namespaced to Git).</p>
