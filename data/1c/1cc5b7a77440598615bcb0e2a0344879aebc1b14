Introduced in 2015, Apple's Live Photos capture 1.5 seconds of video and audio before and after you take a picture, with the aim of adding a little bit of life and movement to still images.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/09/live-motion-photos-meta-ai-chat-themes-video-call-backgrounds-more-whatsapp/">blog post</a> on Monday rounding up its recent feature additions, Meta-owned WhatsApp listed support for Live Photos on iOS, as well as Motion Photos – the equivalent format on Android. <br/>
<br/>
When a Live Photo appears in a WhatsApp conversation, the familiar Live Photo symbol appears in the top-left corner of the preview image. Tapping the image plays the related clip as well as accompanying audio.<br/>
<br/>
Among the other features recently added, you can now use Meta AI to design custom chat themes and generate unique video call backgrounds, or add AI-powered backdrops to photos and videos in chats. In addition, finding a group chat has become easier – you can now search for a contact in your Chats tab, and WhatsApp will show the groups you share.<br/>
