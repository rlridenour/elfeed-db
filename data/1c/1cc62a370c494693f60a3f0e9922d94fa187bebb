<p>I recently built a WordPress plugin specifically for my friend Allison Sheridan over at <a href="https://www.podfeet.com/blog/">Podfeet Podcasts</a>. She had a <a href="https://www.podfeet.com/blog/system-settings-macos-26/"><em>huge</em> mind map</a> she wanted to display on her blog &mdash; HTML embeds were messy and broke the site, PNG exports were unsearchable and impossible to navigate, and she didn&rsquo;t want to just offer an OPML download. So she output an SVG, and I built a viewer to embed it in a WordPress post with nice zooming and panning, text searchability, and a bunch of customization options.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve submitted that plugin to the WordPress registry, but it will take a couple of weeks before it&rsquo;s available. In the meantime, if you want to check it out, you can learn more at the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/wp-svg-viewer">BT SVG Viewer GitHub repo</a>, or just <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/wp-svg-viewer/releases/latest/download/wp-svg-viewer.zip">download the latest zip file</a> and use Upload Plugin to install it. It has complete built-in help you can access from the Preset Editor page. But I&rsquo;ll post more about that when it&rsquo;s available for easy install.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I thought I&rsquo;d <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/jekyll-svg-viewer">port it to Jekyll</a>. I don&rsquo;t have an immediate need for it, but being able to display mind maps such as those exported from MindNode Next seems like something I&rsquo;ll definitely want to do sooner or later.</p>

<p>I packaged the Jekyll plugin as a gem, so you can install it just by adding it to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> and your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>. Once that&rsquo;s done, when you build the site, you&rsquo;ll get a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/svg-viewer/preset-builder/</code> that gives you an interface for building the Liquid tag used to embed the actual viewer.</p>

<p>Copying the generated Liquid tag and pasting it into a post serves up your SVG like:</p>

<p>You can define a whole set of default options for the tag in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many people will need this one, but I think it came out really polished and will be a perfect solution for those who <em>do</em> need it. Check out the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/jekyll-svg-viewer">project page</a> for more details.</p>
