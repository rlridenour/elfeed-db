<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in Japan are now able to use Apple's Messages via satellite feature, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/newsroom/2025/12/messages-via-satellite-is-now-available-in-japan/">said today</a>. Messages via satellite works on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 or later and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 3</a>, allowing users who have no cellular or Wi-Fi connection to use satellite connectivity for messaging.<br/>

When attempting to send a message with no cellular or Wi-Fi connection, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Japan will see a message that prompts them to connect to the nearest satellite. After connecting, users can send and receive iMessages, SMS messages, emoji characters, and use the Messages Tapback feature.<br/>
<br/>
Messages sent via satellite offer the same end-to-end encryption as messages sent over Wi-Fi or cellular.<br/>
<br/>
Japanese users already had access to emergency SOS via satellite and the option to share location via satellite in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> app, so the new Messages via satellite option joins those two features.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 or later is required for Messages via satellite on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, while the feature needs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a> or later on the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 3&zwnj;. Satellite connectivity continues to be free for all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch users with supported devices.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/japan/">Japan</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/japan-messages-via-satellite/">iPhone Users in Japan Can Now Send Messages via Satellite</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-users-in-japan-can-now-send-messages-via-satellite.2474399/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
