<p>President Donald Trump told the World Economic Forum in Davos that a negotiated end to the Russia-Ukraine war is “reasonably close,” and said he plans to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday in Switzerland. In parallel, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said he and Jared Kushner will travel to Moscow on Thursday for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, after Russia invited them, and then proceed to the United Arab Emirates for additional working-group meetings. The reporting portrays diplomacy picking up speed even as fighting continues, with Politico noting ongoing Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure during a severe winter in Kyiv.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/j4dq6UK9egahs_x_93Lmaa8JGwCJvr_0NVrEOFVahf8BROG2dOESuxNP3NJWUDR0f_V7MCQlfKXbXas2APzvL8dvnwyI0wM9PGa2tfFoyPDdeEJl8Jgl4oTVQvey8EkXn88psVL3l8Doh7XQSAoVkzeLBKHR7vBKRfEnyKsxuJorLMv_g3v-dDd7t8U5amQ' alt='US President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he said a Ukraine deal is “reasonably close.”' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>20-point framework: Witkoff said the discussions build on Washington’s “20-point peace plan,” with negotiators now focused on “land deals” as the central unresolved issue.</li><li>Territory signals: RT reported that a leaked version of Trump’s initial peace plan discussed Ukraine ceding territory and renouncing NATO aspirations, though details of any current draft were not spelled out in Trump’s Davos remarks.</li><li>Broader Davos diplomacy: Politico reported Trump held Davos meetings Wednesday with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and the leaders of Poland, Belgium and Egypt ahead of the Zelenskyy session.</li><li>Process tone: RT said U.S. officials described prior rounds with Russian and Ukrainian counterparts as “constructive” and showing some progress, even without a breakthrough yet.</li><li>Scheduling wrinkle: The Guardian live coverage cited a Zelenskyy adviser saying he was in Kyiv (not Davos) and that the meeting would not happen “today” as Trump had suggested earlier, indicating timing remained fluid.</li></ul><blockquote>I think I can say that we&#x27;re reasonably close - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump (United States): Trump said Russia and Ukraine appear close enough to “come together and get a deal done,” while describing the needed trade-offs as a difficult balance.
