Apple hasn't introduced a major update for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> since the headphones came out in 2020, but last year there was a minor refresh with new color options and an upgrade to USB-C charging. With no additional new features on the horizon, we thought we'd take a look at whether the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are worth picking up in 2025.<br/>

The transition to USB-C didn't upgrade any other internal hardware, so reviews from 2020 about Active Noise Cancellation and sound quality are still valid. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; sound great even after five years, but nothing has improved in terms of the overarching listening experience, and with no design updates, the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are still on the heavy side for ANC over-ear headphones, and some people find them uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
USB-C charging is definitely more convenient than the Lightning-based charging from the prior model, but there is one other change that could draw audiophiles to the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;. With a USB-C wired connection, the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; support 24-bit 48kHz lossless audio and ultra-low latency, which means you can listen to music the way the artist intended it to sound in the studio.<br/>
<br/>
The latency improvement is notable if you want to use your &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; for things like gaming or editing with a Mac, because there's no longer a Bluetooth listening delay. Unfortunately, you need the USB-C version of the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; to use these new features, so if you have older Lightning-based &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; that you bought sometime in the last five years, you won't get the lossless and latency improvements.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are still stylish and you get Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos, which go a long way toward improving the listening experience, plus the ANC is still competitive with other brands. If you can get the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; on sale so you're not shelling out over &#36;500, the USB-C model is worth considering, but make sure you like the fit.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/airpods-max-2025-review/">Video Review: The AirPods Max in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/video-review-the-airpods-max-in-2025.2455836/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
