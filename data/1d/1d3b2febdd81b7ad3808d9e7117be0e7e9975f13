<p><a href="https://campuspress.yale.edu/jasonstanley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Stanley</a> is well known for his work in philosophy of language as well as his more recent work in political philosophy, particularly on topics such as propaganda and fascism. You can learn more about his writings <a href="https://philpeople.org/profiles/jason-stanley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>In an email, he writes that &#8220;the decision was entirely because of the political climate in the United States.&#8221; He had had an offer from Toronto, and decided to accept it last Friday night after <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/03/24/columbia-trump-peril-appeasement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Columbia&#8217;s capitulation</a> to the Trump administration&#8217;s demands.</p>
<p>He notes that he will be joining others who left Yale for the Munk School, such historians <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/person/timothy-snyder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timothy Snyder</a> and <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/person/marci-shore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marci Shore</a>.</p>
<p>Stanley writes that he has been &#8220;very happy at Yale, with the department and the university,&#8221; but that he wants &#8220;to raise my kids in a country that is not tilting towards a fascist dictatorship.&#8221;</p>
<p>He takes up his new position at Toronto in the fall.</p>
