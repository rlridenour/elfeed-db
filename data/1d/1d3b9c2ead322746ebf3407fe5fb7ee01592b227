Apple last updated the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; line with the M4 chip and OLED display technology in May 2024, so there will be about 17 months between the M4 launch and the M5 launch.<br/>
<br/>
Since the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; got a major design overhaul with OLED in 2024, the 2025 models aren't expected to feature design changes. They'll have the same slimmed down chassis and OLED display, but will be equipped with the faster M5 chip. The M5 chip will be built on TSMC's improved 3-nanometer process, and it will bring performance and efficiency improvements.<br/>
