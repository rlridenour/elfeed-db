<p>Alissa Falcone, in a good piece looking back at (my alma mater) Drexel University’s groundbreaking deal with Apple 40 years ago to provide deeply discounted Macintoshes to all students, and integrate them throughout the campus and curriculums:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Drexel was prepared to buy IBM computers — and had equipped its
computer centers with IBMs for decades — but the cost came to
more than $1,000 per unit. IBM’s young competitor Apple, on the
other hand, was willing to give discounts, provided the University
agreed to secret negotiations and discreet showings of its newest,
unreleased personal computer.</p>

<p>Bruce Eisenstein, PhD, Arthur J. Rowland Professor of Electrical
and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering, was the
head of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
the time, and had been the founding faculty adviser for the Drexel
Computer Society started in 1972. He was Drexel’s choice to meet
with an Apple representative to see the future Macintosh, which
had never-before-seen properties like a mouse, icons on a screen
and different fonts. This new Apple product was more powerful and
easier to use than earlier personal computers; novices could
supposedly master it in 30 minutes (without the need to memorize
and type coded commands). And Apple agreed on the $1,000 price tag
for a model that sold to the public for $2,495.</p>

<p>“I went back to the selection committee and I said, ‘Listen, you
have to forget the IBM. This new computer from Apple is the one
you have to get. They are going to make it available to us for a
thousand dollars — that’s all inclusive.’ And the first question
was ‘Is it compatible with the IBM computer?’ Well, no. Was there
software for it? No. Were there any programs for it, like a word
processor? Not yet. So the committee justifiably kept saying,
well, what’s the name of this? What’s it like? I couldn’t tell
them. I had to say you just gotta trust me on this. So they took a
vote and unanimously voted to adopt the unknown computer that
turned out to be the Macintosh,” Eisenstein recalled in <em>Building
Drexel: The University and Its City, 1891-2016</em>.</p>

<p>Drexel chose the untested Macintosh even knowing that Apple
wouldn’t announce it to the public until January 1984 and that the
computers wouldn’t be ready until March, almost halfway through
that momentous academic year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never had the pleasure of meeting Eisenstein, but I’d sure like to thank him for his prescience. By the time I got to Drexel in 1991 the Mac was infused throughout campus.</p>
