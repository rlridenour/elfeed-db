<p>The White House has confirmed that a U.S. Navy admiral ordered a second air strike on a suspected Venezuelan drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean on September 2, after the first attack left people in the water, and says the operation was lawful and within his authority. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Admiral Frank M. Bradley, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, acted under authorization from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ensure the vessel was fully destroyed as part of President Trump’s campaign against cartels that Washington links to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Legal experts, some lawmakers from both parties, and former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta have questioned whether firing again when there were survivors could violate international law that protects shipwrecked persons, prompting bipartisan congressional reviews of the broader series of at least 19–21 maritime strikes launched since early September. President Trump has said he would not have wanted a second strike on survivors and has convened senior advisers to consider next steps in his Venezuela pressure campaign, which has included a naval buildup, warnings about Venezuelan airspace, and at least 21 attacks on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. While the situation is tense and raises serious legal questions, one constructive sign is that U.S. institutions—including Congress and the military—are openly scrutinizing the decisions, offering a chance for clearer rules and stronger safeguards in future operations.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/sXdslSFzUkH1iiGZft4l3N1-h0Q1Jy8JfSWUxrvXxocdccEsy6-78TBKBsU0UE_gLa2pQ88P2Bjw8-Ycr3_ajL_cbvEf3VAmTxjLUu_w4A6uoUrxlNQwmEqfBWnZWxJeVKaC2YmHNEVF5oRtl9UmA-BXFSvcMlKBDQjKtDwcDKVEUDZD4HVyGjIr9TfcFtGbrD_o6ind1jue2s6P3hlIvYxwZ-MlE2YO7cGfjGapjjEhpc-cMUTXNO0srDR4e0K4CBY2AhD9SaAi4yh_eQ' alt='White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt briefs reporters on the legality of the follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scope of campaign: Since early September, U.S. forces have carried out roughly 19–21 airstrikes on suspected narcotics vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, leaving more than 70–83 people dead according to varying tallies in investigative reports.</li><li>Command chain debate: The White House says Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct the September 2 operation, while some reports allege Hegseth gave a verbal order to &quot;kill everybody&quot; on board, a characterization he disputes.</li><li>Trump’s stated view: President Trump told reporters he &quot;wouldn’t have wanted&quot; a follow-up strike specifically to kill survivors and said he would look into what happened while expressing continued confidence in Hegseth.</li><li>Congressional response: Lawmakers from both parties have called for detailed briefings and announced committee reviews of the maritime strikes, including whether they complied with international humanitarian law and U.S. constitutional limits on the use of force.</li><li>Maduro’s reaction: Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has publicly rejected what he calls a &quot;slave’s peace,&quot; denounced the U.S. naval deployment as prolonged &quot;testing&quot; of his country, and insists he has no ties to the drug trade.</li></ul><blockquote>Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was totally destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated. - Karoline Leavitt</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House: Officials argue the admiral’s decision to hit the vessel a second time fell squarely within his legal authority and was necessary to eliminate a threat as part of an armed conflict with drug cartels linked by Washington to the Maduro government.
