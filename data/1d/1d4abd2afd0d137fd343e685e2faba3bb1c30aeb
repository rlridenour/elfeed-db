<p>I just found out Kagi made its assistant available to all paying customers, meaning I can use quite a few LLMs (like ChatGPT or Gemini) directly from Kagi, included in my plan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t fully understand how the token system works or how it&rsquo;s used to determine the search&rsquo;s cost, but it seems like I&rsquo;m not going to run out anytime soon.</p>
<p>Like the rest of Kagi, AI is available if you want it - it&rsquo;s not shoved in your face everywhere you go (looking at you Microsoft) as if it&rsquo;s the damn messiah delivering you from the horror of search. Search is still enjoyable - especially on Kagi.
