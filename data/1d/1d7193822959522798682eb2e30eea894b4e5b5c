<p>The Trump administration is pulling about 700 federal immigration enforcement agents out of Minnesota, effective immediately, while leaving roughly 2,000 agents in the state, according to White House border czar Tom Homan. The shift comes after weeks of enforcement activity and rising tensions in and around Minneapolis. Multiple outlets have linked the operation to deadly shootings that sparked outrage. Homan said the administration can scale back because state and local authorities have increased cooperation, including handing over immigrants after arrests, which he argued reduces the need for as many federal personnel on the ground. Federal officials stressed that immigration raids and deportations will continue despite the drawdown, framing it as a staffing adjustment rather than a change in enforcement goals.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/4QG9S4bAVtkUtQrSlOuK9cb2bxN5Bcx-khQUwS0dGEDq66dbSLrG7xwL705QbCSu5NjMwlGiW8fLz0S4I3eb03-rn-l-bRISE_iiuB7KVy3_f4qoK1T_cNpkTRTcRsIpwzUW8gXFXT28Api7EKyO8Lq6CSuQr_Z5RY9rYN4nItKQQ--nRQ' alt='White House &#x27;border czar&#x27; Tom Homan speaks during a press conference at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on February 4, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>How big the cut is: DW reported Homan described the pullback as nearly a quarter of federal officers deployed in Minnesota.</li><li>What the deployment looked like: El País reported the withdrawal comes from a deployment of nearly 3,000 federal agents in Minneapolis.</li><li>Minneapolis is still central: Homan said federal agents will keep operating in Minneapolis, which DW described as a major flashpoint.</li><li>What led up to it: Le Monde tied the decision to weeks of operations and reported it followed the fatal shooting of two protesters that set off outrage.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Tom Homan (White House border czar): He said the withdrawal would take effect immediately and warned that the administration’s mass-deportation mission would continue.
