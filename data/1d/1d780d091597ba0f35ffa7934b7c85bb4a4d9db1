<p>Ukraine says a U.S.-Ukraine document on security guarantees is “100% ready” and now awaits a time and place to be signed following two days of talks that also involved U.S. and Russian representatives. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented the pending pact as part of Kyiv’s broader push to strengthen its position as negotiations continue on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine, while noting that Ukrainian and Russian positions remain far apart on territorial issues. European leaders are also watching closely as the process intersects with wider debates about NATO burden-sharing and Europe’s security posture under President Trump.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RbE2EqSGhBgcaXKNaOOH2k2RYhNoMEXr0XdSUtG5EacsHp8oTqR2RmA7p7zLbYLE2GR5ClkbZIiWiDBnWlhwPAEMseBo2N-VK2I58OAX5hIRBBcQciKE5bv8BTppKGpios-1isCelLdVYcZpkRItF7MpViDEcieJRUh6AVjRhg' alt='Image accompanying coverage of Zelenskyy saying a U.S. security agreement is ready for signing.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>EU deadline push: Zelenskyy renewed Ukraine’s goal of joining the European Union by 2027, describing EU accession as an “economic security guarantee” alongside military arrangements.</li><li>Skepticism voiced: Russia welcomed the trilateral format but cautioned against expecting “significant results,” signaling that even with talks continuing, a quick breakthrough is uncertain.</li><li>What’s in it: Analysts and Ukrainians cited by Al Jazeera questioned whether proposed guarantees would deter future attacks without clearer enforcement mechanisms and binding commitments.</li><li>Next round set: Kyiv described the discussions as ongoing and said negotiators plan to continue on February 1, keeping diplomatic channels open.</li><li>Alliance tensions: European officials reacted sharply to President Trump’s remarks about NATO allies’ roles in Afghanistan, with Germany’s defense minister urging an apology as allied unity becomes part of the backdrop to Ukraine talks.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine (President Volodymyr Zelenskyy): Zelenskyy said the U.S. security agreement is “100% ready” and that Kyiv is waiting for partners to set a signing date, while also stressing Ukraine’s EU membership push as a key guarantee.
