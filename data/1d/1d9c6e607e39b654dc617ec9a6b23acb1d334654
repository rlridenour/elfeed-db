Before the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Air debuted, rumors suggested that it would adopt the C1 modem chip that Apple first introduced with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>. It turns out Apple had another idea in mind, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air is equipped with a new C1X chip.<br/>

Apple says the C1X modem is up to 2x faster than the C1, while using the same cellular technologies. It is apparently faster than the Qualcomm modem in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, while using 30 percent less energy. According to Apple, the C1X is the most power-efficient modem in an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple seems to be referring to sub-6GHz 5G speeds when it says the C1X is faster than the modem in the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;, because the chip still doesn't support mmWave 5G speeds. <br/>
<br/>
The C1X is limited to sub-6GHz 5G bands, while the Qualcomm modem in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max supports both sub-6GHz and mmWave. Sub-6GHz is the more widespread version of 5G, while mmWave is more limited and is typically found in major cities and urban areas. <br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air has longer battery life than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> despite its thin size, and it also offers better battery life than the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; with C1 modem. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air lasts for up to 27 hours when watching videos, while the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; lasts for up to 26 hours. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-air-c1x-modem/">iPhone Air Gets Faster and More Efficient C1X 5G Modem, But No mmWave</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-gets-faster-and-more-efficient-c1x-5g-modem-but-no-mmwave.2465056/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
