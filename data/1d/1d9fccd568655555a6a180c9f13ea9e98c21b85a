Well, not really prodigal, but the return—nonetheless—of a son assumed lost. Michał Sapka has a blog post about his <a href="https://michal.sapka.pl/weblog/2026/rte-return-to-emacs/">return to Emacs</a>. A while ago, Sapka left Emacs for Vim and the shell. He liked them but realized that Emacs <i>really is</i> different.
</p>
<p>
The way it&rsquo;s different is telling. Although you can do anything in Vim and shell, Emacs is different. As Sapka puts it,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It&rsquo;s not that nothing stops you from connecting Mastodon.el, Magit and Mu4e, it&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s natural.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Because all of Emacs is exposed to the user, it&rsquo;s easy to modify it to fit your workflow and string together disparate applications in ways that their authors never intended. Sapka makes the same point that Irreal and others have made: it&rsquo;s not that Emacs has an extension language, it&rsquo;s that Emacs&rsquo; source code is modifiable on the fly from within the application itself at run time. It&rsquo;s a whole different thing.
</p>
<p>
Sapka admits that there are problems but says that they are solvable. Depending on your work environment, solving them may be more or less difficult but they remain solvable.
</p>
<p>
In any event, Sapka has returned to Emacs because, in the end, nothing else provides the same power and flexibility. He ends his post by noting that he&rsquo;s—sort of—combined the power of Emacs and Vim by adopting Evil mode.</p>
