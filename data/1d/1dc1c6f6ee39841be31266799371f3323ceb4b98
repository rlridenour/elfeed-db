<p>The public betas are out for iOS/iPadOS/WatchOS/MacOS 26, and Dan Moren and Jason Snell cover them all at Six Colors. Here’s Moren on iOS 26:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s new design language, dubbed Liquid Glass, applies across
all their platforms, but unsurprisingly, it feels most at home on
the iPhone and iPad. That’s in part because of the touch
interface; the literal hands-on nature makes the feel responsive
and more like physical things that you’re interacting with. For
example, dragging the new magnifying loupe across the screen,
watching the way it magnifies and distorts text and images as it
passes over them — this interaction has always been unique to iOS
for practical reasons, but the way it feels here doesn’t have a
direct analogue on other platforms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For it now being late July, though, there remain a lot of <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114909122813996684">glaring problems</a>. I hope to be proven wrong, but I think the legibility/usability problems are going to make the 26.0 versions of Apple’s OSes unpopular. Functionally, iOS and iPadOS 26 betas 4 are solid. MacOS 26 Tahoe really adds some great productivity features. But visually, not so much for any of these OSes (especially MacOS) — and that, to me, is a serious problem.</p>

<p>Anyway, public beta commentary:</p>
