For those who are not familiar, the AirTag is a small accessory that you can attach to your backpack, keys, or other items. Then, you can track the location of those items in the Find My app on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and iCloud.com.<br/>
<br/>
The new AirTag is equipped with a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, enabling the Precision Finding feature to work up to 50% farther away from an item compared to the previous-generation model, according to Apple. The new AirTag also has an upgraded Bluetooth chip for improved overall range outside of Precision Finding mode.<br/>
<br/>
With an updated internal design, the new AirTag features a 50% louder speaker compared to the previous-generation model, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The external design of the AirTag has not changed, but its weight increased ever so slightly. The accessory continues to be powered by a CR2032 coin cell battery, and the new AirTag has the same IP67-rated water resistance as the original one. Like the previous model, Apple says the new AirTag offers "more than a year" of battery life. <br/>
<br/>
Free personalized AirTag engraving remains available on Apple.com and in the Apple Store app.<br/>
<br/>
The new AirTag is compatible with all existing AirTag accessories, including the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/mgfy4zm/a/airtag-finewoven-key-ring-fox-orange">FineWoven Key Ring</a>, which still has the same design and color options.<br/>
<br/>
The new AirTag requires an iPhone running an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/ios-and-watchos-26-2-1-coming-soon/">incoming iOS 26.2.1 update</a> or later, per Apple.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 26.2.1 is also coming, and it expands Precision Finding to the Apple Watch Series 9 and later, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 and later. We have not yet confirmed if this is for the new AirTag only or also works with the original model.<br/>

The new AirTag is available to order on Apple.com and in the Apple Store app starting today, and it will be available at Apple Store locations later this week. In the U.S., pricing remains set at &#36;29 for an individual AirTag, while a four pack continues to cost &#36;99.<br/>
<br/>
Apple unveiled the AirTag in 2021, so there was nearly a five-year wait for a new model.<br/>
<br/>
"Since the launch of AirTag in 2021, users from around the world have shared stories of being reunited with lost luggage, keys, bicycles, bags, and more," said Apple, in a press release. "With the help of AirTag placed inside an instrument case, a musician was able to locate their lost instrument and perform that evening, while another user was able to find lost luggage that contained a lifesaving medication."<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the AirTag is the world's best-selling item tracking accessory. It competes with trackers from Tile, Samsung, Pebblebee, Chipolo, and others.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/">AirTag</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-announces-new-airtag/">Apple Unveils New AirTag With Longer Range, Louder Speaker, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-unveils-new-airtag-with-longer-range-louder-speaker-and-more.2476637/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
