Apple today released new firmware for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2 earbuds that came out earlier this year. The updated firmware has a version number of 8A353, an update to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-releases-powerbeats-pro-2-firmware-7b30/">prior 7B30 firmware</a> that came out in March.<br/>

The updated firmware <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/12/ios-26-new-powerbeats-pro-2-features/">adds new functionality</a> when combined with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> update. The heart rate monitoring feature in the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 is now compatible with the Fitness app, and wearers will be able to see real-time performance metrics like heart rate, calories burned, and the Burn Bar, features that previously required an Apple Watch. <br/>
<br/>
Both the Apple Watch and &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 can be used simultaneously to provide data to the Health app, and Apple added a new algorithm that improves heart rate reading speeds. If there's a poor fit that's impacting heart rate monitoring, a new alert will suggest adjustments. <br/>
<br/>
Heart rate monitoring in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; can be done with just a single earbud, and the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 can be used for step tracking even when the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is not nearby. Apple also added support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> head gestures, so there is now an option to nod your head yes or shake your head no to accept or decline calls, hear or decline text messages, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Most of these features are designed for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users, but the improved heart rate tracking algorithm and fit notifications are also available on Android devices. <br/>
<br/>
The updated firmware can be installed on the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 by connecting them to power and ensuring that they are in Bluetooth range of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi. Firmware can be checked on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by going to Settings > Bluetooth and tapping the Info button next to the Beats headphones in the list. Android users can download new Beats firmware through the Beats app for Android.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/16/apple-releases-powerbeats-pro-2-firmware-8a353/">Apple Releases New Powerbeats Pro 2 Firmware With iOS 26 Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-powerbeats-pro-2-firmware-with-ios-26-features.2466067/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
