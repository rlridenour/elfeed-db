<p>The decimal expansion of 1/7 is </p>
<p>0.142857142857 &#8230;</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you split the repeating decimal period in half and add the two complements, you get a string of 9s:</p>
<p>142 + 857 = 999</p>
<p>It turns out this is true for <a href="https://oeis.org/A028416">every fraction with a prime denominator and a repeating decimal period of even length</a>:</p>
<p>1/11 = 0.090909 &#8230;<br />
0 + 9 = 9</p>
<p>1/13 = 076923 &#8230;<br />
076 + 923 = 999</p>
<p>1/17 = 0.0588235294117647 &#8230;<br />
05882352 + 94117647 = 99999999</p>
<p>1/19 = 0.052631578947368421 &#8230;<br />
052631578 + 947368421 = 999999999</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/mathfacpub/48/">discovered by French mathematician E. Midy in 1836</a>.</p>
