Lord of all,
</p>

 <p>
What are these hands <br></br>
that they should seize <br></br>
what is offered as a free gift?
</p>

 <p>
What are these hands <br></br>
that they should grasp <br></br>
what should be shared?
</p>

 <p>
What are these hands <br></br>
that they should clench in anger <br></br>
at the thought that you <br></br>
would ever bless anyone else?
</p>

 <p>
What are these hands?
</p>

 <p>
Just the hands of one <br></br>
who would once again <br></br>
crucify the Christ.
</p>

 <p>
A sinner, <br></br>
lost but for <br></br>
the grace of God.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
