Apple today announced that Beats and Japanese graphic artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/verdy">Verdy</a> have teamed up to bring back a collectible Beats Pill holder.<br/>

This time, the cream-coloured "Vear" bear holds the Beats Pill in his mouth, whereas the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/verdy-beats-pill-vear/">original version</a> from last year holds the speaker between its paws.<br/>
<br/>
Beats and Verdy have been promoting the collectible figure <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNfK3DdSQE6/">on Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nch4ljePeW8">YouTube</a>.<br/>

As part of a so-called "hyper-limited drop," the new Vear will be available starting this Thursday, August 21, exclusively at the Dover Street Market in London, England. A bundle with the figure and a Beats Pill will set you back £380, which is equivalent to a little more than &#36;500 in the United States. The speaker costs &#36;149.99 on its own.<br/>
<br/>
The bundle will roll out across the U.S., China, and Japan later this year, according to Apple. Exact pricing in those countries has not yet been disclosed.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing unique about the Beats Pill included in the bundle.<br/>
