<p>The US Defense Department has opened an investigation into Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona after he appeared in a video with five other lawmakers urging military and intelligence personnel not to follow unlawful commands from President Trump’s administration. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the video “despicable, reckless, and false” and said the Pentagon is considering recalling Kelly, a retired Navy captain and former astronaut, to active duty so he could face possible court-martial under laws that keep some retired officers subject to the military justice system. Kelly and the other Democrats argue they were reminding service members of their duty to refuse illegal orders, while critics inside the administration say the message could be seen as encouraging disobedience and even sedition. The dispute highlights a testy moment in US civil-military relations, but it is also prompting a very public discussion about the military’s long‑standing obligation to uphold the law and the Constitution above any single leader.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fYkUr0wKz7qTchcwU8Uvjm5RXFm3Ml7Eie8MEvFQRClNqO0JnWMWQiCcNKzuPBYLReQsE5fLCeBqjDvSxpHDJHt_UI5OIJLX1e86Nll0Swr0bw9yqu8d6gfurpRHbJMAsX3rcg3gL7RnTEqZtONpE5H2UZdXzCgxYc65WitJWjayzJZrR3vCGYpDVWJSiRK2ba_NO5i1qFfLElLlFxs69iij-l-1lwgSj7nhTSAQ2prXvLUOlBjSCT2seqPvmNYPW-KUcc7-cu5lrc86mA' alt='Senator Mark Kelly speaks during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing at the US Capitol in Washington.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Legal mechanism: The Pentagon’s statement cited a federal statute that allows certain retired officers to be brought back onto active Navy duty so they can be tried under the Uniform Code of Military Justice if the defense secretary orders it.</li><li>Kelly’s military record: Kelly previously served as a decorated US Navy combat pilot before later commanding the Space Shuttle Endeavour’s final mission for NASA, giving him a high profile within both military and space communities.</li><li>Defense secretary’s criticism: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X that the lawmakers’ video was “despicable, reckless, and false,” accusing Kelly specifically of encouraging troops to ignore commands from their chain of command.</li><li>Kelly’s response: Kelly publicly rejected the Pentagon’s threat, saying attempts “to intimidate me and other members of Congress” would not change his stance and framing the investigation as an effort by the administration to pressure lawmakers.</li><li>Group of six lawmakers: Kelly appeared in the video alongside five other Democrats with backgrounds in the military or intelligence services, all of whom addressed uniformed and civilian personnel about refusing unlawful directives from the executive branch.</li></ul><blockquote>Attempts to intimidate me and other members of Congress will not work - Senator Mark Kelly</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Senator Mark Kelly: Kelly says the video simply reminded troops of their duty to reject unlawful commands and insists he will not be intimidated by threats of military prosecution from the administration.
