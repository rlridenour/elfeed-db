<li>Just $0.25 per bar instead of $1.00</li>
<li>A decent amount of protein to get you through your morning</li>
<li>Maybe even enough to be an on-the-go breakfast</li>
<li>Healthy! (By which they mean: not absolutely terrible for you)</li>
<li>Best By: 3/25/2026</li>
<li>Are they Mac compatible: Not without a special dongle</li>
</ul><h1>One Option</h1><p>Last time we sold these, <a href="/@meherson">@meherson</a> wrote:</p>

<p>Last night, I realized I was down to my last box, from my order of these 7 years ago or so. I thought to myself, “Hopefully Meh will put them up again soon!” This morning I realized that I need to be much more specific in my wishes. “Hopefully Meh will put these up again soon, with no pineapple purchase required.” That should work, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrong, meherson, you fool! Your insistence has clearly angered the e-commerce gods, and now pineapple mango is your ONLY OPTION!</p>
<p>Oh, the horror!</p>
<p>Or maybe they were responding to <a href="/@Kendradawn82">@Kendradawn82</a>, who commented on one of the sales before that one, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hopefully, this comes back again soon. I’ve never tried the strawberry banana and I love the pineapple one and the mixed Berry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can’t help with the strawberry banana or the mixed berry, Kendra, but if you love the pineapple flavor, oh boy, do we have great news for you.</p>
<p>And for those of you thinking, <em>Eh, I’m not a big fan of pineapple and/or mango</em>, we’ve got great news for <em>you</em> as well. According to <a href="/@walarney">@walarney</a> these are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Made with half a mango slice and one chunk of pineapple.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See? Unlike other bars that overwhelm you with exciting flavor, these KIND bars are much more bla-- err, let’s say, subdued. And (according to walarney again) that could be a good thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got these last time and still have a bunch. Taste OK, but they don’t call to me to eat them – so, safe to keep in desk drawer. Seems like a better idea than candy when you get a little hungry in the afternoon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a great point! That’s why they’re “healthy,” really: because you’ll have one and then say, “Eh, I’m good,” instead of going back for more.</p>
<p>Perfect, right?</p>
<p>Although, according to <a href="/@auralaura">@auralaura</a>, there are ways to make them better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either Amazon or a prior commenter here recommended a quick zap (just a few seconds) in the microwave to make them a bit softer and slightly gooey and can confirm that is a great approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds delicious!</p>
<p>Look, just buy some, okay.</p>
<p>The pineapple mango KIND bar sales will continue until morale improves!</p>
