<p>Rescuers in Indonesia are continuing a difficult search for dozens of people still unaccounted for after a predawn landslide hit Pasir Langu village on the slopes of Mount Burangrang in West Java, burying homes after torrential rain. Reported death tolls vary by outlet as recovery efforts continue, with figures ranging from around 10 to at least 25, reflecting the evolving nature of the operation. Conditions on the ground have slowed the response, including deep mud and waterlogged, unstable terrain, though improved weather on Sunday was reported to help recovery work. Authorities have also urged residents in flood-affected parts of West Java to move to safer areas as heavy rain risk persists.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/C25UDJzLtNmSSZKKMiD7N_hFpsqUFcBPj0y1TcSqgPdXaxai_dQAWatcxz9CLuqzSXGt6VIwuaUJ8r6HuYV2QIUfsEo9iTVCGlda6PhFK9yjkxAlXS_0U8bSeTzB3niJMXR7IcobZ5pzAKIm4LojGnMQ1N9wpuptSKCMTHOVQw' alt='Rescue teams search through mud and debris after a landslide in West Java, Indonesia.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Homes buried: The slide was reported to have buried about 34 houses in Pasir Langu village, highlighting how quickly hillside settlements can be overwhelmed during intense rain.</li><li>Evacuations nearby: Roughly 230 residents living near the affected area were reported to have been moved away from danger as a precaution.</li><li>Flood spillover: Separate flooding was reported across parts of West Java, including Jakarta, prompting some residents to evacuate to higher ground or unaffected places.</li><li>Weather warning: Indonesia’s weather agency warned that heavy rain could continue for a week in West Java and other regions, complicating rescue work and raising the risk of additional incidents.</li><li>Rescue constraints: Officials and local media reported that continuing rain and unstable ground made it hard to use heavy machinery safely in the early phase of the operation.</li></ul><blockquote>Sometimes we have only small floods from the nearest river, but this time (the landslide) came from the forest, - Dedi Kurniawan</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Rescue authorities: Responders describe search conditions as hazardous due to soaked soil, heavy mud and unstable terrain that limit safe access and machinery use.
