<p>European planemaker Airbus has instructed airlines worldwide to carry out an emergency software change on around 6,000 aircraft from its A320 family, after discovering that intense solar radiation can corrupt data used by flight-control computers. The order follows an October 30 incident on a JetBlue A320 flight from Cancun to Newark, when a guidance system malfunction caused an abrupt, uncommanded loss of altitude and an emergency diversion to Tampa, injuring several people on board. Regulators including the European Union Aviation Safety Agency have issued or prepared emergency airworthiness directives temporarily grounding affected jets until airlines either roll back to a previous software version or replace certain computers, a process that typically takes about two hours per aircraft but could take weeks where hardware changes are needed. The decision, which Airbus says prioritises safety even at the cost of short-term disruption, is affecting carriers across the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Pacific during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year, but the fix itself is technically straightforward and does not involve structural issues with the aircraft.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Jmo4OsCtRYDSU7Z0jiORZ6-0oFq4PxR-UkCiEZd14wRHWBbecbddI_aS1dW8RjbPhAErI-AcXFxSsN5NUrVnEhhS0yEFUUrU89gCgNyk_5F5_W6wjjPsfpuqh2uDgm0DWdA1t7Sl-OwZIphlq6jsrnXxect_GBz2RH2gL-T4Xtbc-5bzGOusCZfK3_0FQWmcW88Nnh7KkNR4r-PF5s7t-MD1_ldc24nBGPYt_tmwPQi3VoJ4Z8Fmog1OyDTAYEHDglVi9_arHZox_-g' alt='An Airbus A320 passenger aircraft takes off from Malaga-Costa del Sol airport in Spain.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of grounding: The recall touches more than half of the global A320-family fleet, with about 6,000 aircraft temporarily sidelined out of roughly 11,300 in service worldwide.</li><li>Jetstar and Australia: Low-cost carrier Jetstar cancelled about 90 domestic and international flights across Australia and New Zealand on Saturday while it applied the software changes to parts of its Airbus fleet.</li><li>Indian carrier impact: Indian regulators barred operations of Airbus A319, A320 and A321 jets until fixes are completed, leaving more than 200 aircraft operated by IndiGo and Air India temporarily grounded.</li><li>American Airlines response: American Airlines, the largest A320 operator, said roughly 340 of its 480 A320-family jets required the fix and expected to complete most updates by Saturday, with around two hours needed per aircraft.</li><li>Latin American constraints: Colombian carrier Avianca, which has more than 70% of its fleet affected, temporarily closed ticket sales for travel dates through December 8 to manage scheduling while repairs are carried out.</li></ul><blockquote>Airbus acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers. - Airbus statement</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Airbus: Airbus says the recall is a precautionary move after tests showed that intense solar radiation can corrupt data essential to the flight-control system and stresses that the change must be completed before the next routine flights, even though it expects this to cause short-term disruption for airlines and passengers..
