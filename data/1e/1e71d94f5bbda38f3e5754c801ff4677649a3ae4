<p>In Guinea-Bissau, the armed forces have removed President Umaro Sissoco Embaló from power and flown him to neighboring Senegal, where authorities say he arrived &quot;safe and sound&quot; on a chartered military plane on Thursday. The military has created a &quot;High Military Command for the Restoration of Order&quot; and sworn in Major General Horta Inta‑a (also reported as Horta N’ta Na Man) as transitional president for a one‑year period, after halting the announcement of results from Sunday’s presidential election. Opposition candidate Fernando Dias da Costa claims he had won the vote and alleges that Embaló engineered the upheaval by placing the general in charge of the government so that he could continue to rule indirectly, an accusation the junta has not publicly addressed. The United Nations and regional bloc ECOWAS have condemned the military takeover as a breach of constitutional order and have called for the rapid restoration of democratic institutions, even as Senegal’s mediation helped secure Embaló’s relocation and avoid further immediate violence.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/BEn4ogphNeAArHgwILt5Kl6S5p2dyJgiQG_gtWtkKPnzX51m-zUClH3pbvMUJY5tbtLBFxxi4TcYYK55nz5aRcW2bR6K23Byf_L9W2yySJqSKW_jRop_z3n3w2dx5brbEQPnN_6sykDoOLdJ_M1fp9LQdLYVhZ6vziD9JHB_C2QvPBNk7_IVSGikUirizaEaMVOp0SeeFR2yKEXE-rIBeyd8' alt='General Horta Inta‑a is sworn in as transitional leader of Guinea-Bissau after the military takeover.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Election dispute: The coup unfolded just days after a national presidential election whose results had not yet been formally declared when soldiers intervened and stopped the counting process, leaving the outcome officially unresolved.</li><li>Transitional mandate: Military statements describe General Horta Inta‑a’s role as heading a one‑year transition under the High Military Command, which says it aims to restore order and manage state affairs during this period.</li><li>Opposition claims: Opposition contender Fernando Dias da Costa told reporters he believed available tallies showed him ahead and argued that the power grab was designed to prevent electoral authorities from confirming his victory.</li><li>Regional mediation: Senegal’s government said West Africa’s ECOWAS chair played a key role in arranging Embaló’s safe transfer by special flight, underscoring regional efforts to de‑escalate tensions without bloodshed.</li><li>Pattern in region: Analysts note that Guinea‑Bissau’s putsch adds to a wider pattern of recent military takeovers and attempted coups in West Africa, contributing to concerns about democratic backsliding in the region.</li></ul><blockquote>The Secretary‑General strongly condemns the unconstitutional change of government in Guinea‑Bissau, which undermines democratic governance and the rule of law. - António Guterres</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Guinea-Bissau military junta: Military leaders say they have formed a High Military Command for the Restoration of Order and installed General Horta Nta Na Man as transitional president for one year to manage state affairs after removing the elected authorities.
