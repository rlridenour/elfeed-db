As most of you know, I&rsquo;m a true believer in the idea of &ldquo;living in Emacs&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve imported every task possible into Emacs to the point where virtually all my tube time is spend either in Emacs or my browser. My third most used application is Apple&rsquo;s Messages but it&rsquo;s a distant third. Everything else gets immeasurably small use.
</p>
<p>
This has always seemed right and obvious to me. At the same time I&rsquo;ve always been dismissive of the newer notion of living in your browser. Why would anyone—other than Aunt Millie—want to do that, I thought.
</p>
<p>
Then I read <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/10/thoughts_observations_and_links_regarding_chatgpt_atlas">this Daring Fireball post on ChatGPT Atlas</a>. Gruber is not a fan for reasons you can read in his post if you&rsquo;re interested but the thing that resonated with me was this quote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But, for me, my browser is not “where all of [my] work, tools, and context come together”. I use an email app for email, a notes app for notes, a text editor and blog editor for writing and programming, a photos app for my photo library, a native feed reader app for feed reading, etc.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When I read that, I thought, &ldquo;See? That&rsquo;s why I live in Emacs. Who wants to deal with all those separate applications?&rdquo; And then I thought, &ldquo;You know, I could make a blog post out of that.&rdquo; Of course, as Paul Graham said, <a href="https://paulgraham.com/words.html">writing down your thoughts usually reveals that you didn&rsquo;t really understand them</a>. That&rsquo;s what happened to me. As I started to lay out this post, I realized there was a contradiction. Why is living in Emacs a self-evident good and living in the browser something only Aunt Millie would do? More generally, if you&rsquo;re going to have one app to rule them all, why should it be Emacs?
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s a reasonable question but there&rsquo;s a good answer. In a sense, all my Emacs posts are answers to that question. Let&rsquo;s restrict the discussion to just Emacs and the browser. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that there are any other serious contenders.
</p>
<p>
When I&rsquo;m in Safari there&rsquo;s not much I can do to adapt it to my way of working. Sure, there are some UI adjustments and other settings to tweak and I can even use <a href="https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-everywhere">emacs-everywhere</a> and <a href="https://github.com/televator-apps/vimari">Vimari</a> but basically I have to work the way the browser authors thought I should. Even if I were using, say, Firefox, which is open source and theoretically open to user change, browsers are sufficiently complex that user modifications are not a realistic option.
</p>
<p>
Emacs is different. Even putting aside its extensive user level configurability, it&rsquo;s easy to modify the way any particular function works. You can make your desired changes, install the source in your <code>init.el</code> and those changes will be reflected whenever <i>you</i> load Emacs. Similarly, you can write entirely new functions in the same way. You don&rsquo;t need to understand everything about Emacs to do this, only enough Elisp to express your desired behavior and a few simple rules to install it.
</p>
<p>
My conclusion is that I&rsquo;ll continue living in Emacs and that Aunt Millie and other non-serious people are welcome to live in the browser.</p>
