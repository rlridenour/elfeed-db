I was browsing the interwebs this morning, looking for a way to open a Dired buffer of the current finder window. There is a lot on going the other way, from Emacs to the Finder, but nothing from the Finder to Emacs.
I got this from  <a href="http://datko.net/2013/07/11/open-emacs-dired-buffer-from-dired/%20">Fortune Datko</a>:
</p>

 <p>
Add this to your shell rc file (in my case, .zshrc):
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org42691e0">
# open a dired window for the current directory
dired() {
    emacsclient -e "(dired \"$PWD\")"
}
</pre>

 <p>
Then, assuming that Emacs server is running, type “`dired`” in the shell, and a Dired
buffer of that directory opens in the current Emacs frame.
</p>

 <p>
Just out of curiosity, I wondered what typing “`emacsclient -c .`” would do. It opens a dired buffer in a new frame. I have a shell script called “ec” that starts a new emacs client, but it’s easy to do it with a zsh alias:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="orgc1c05b5">
alias ec="emacsclient -c -a ''"
</pre>

 <p>
This starts a server if there is not one already, then opens a new client. So, typing `ec .` should then open a Dired buffer in a new frame.
