Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro models will feature a significantly upgraded rear camera with a variable aperture, <em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20251015000275">ETNews</a></em> reports.<br/>

The Korean-language report claims that only the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max will feature the camera, which will replace the main wide-angle camera on the rear, sitting alongside the ultra-wide and telephoto cameras.<br/>
<br/>
A variable aperture allows the camera to adjust the amount of light that reaches the sensor. This means that in dark environments, the aperture can be opened to receive more light, while in light environments, it can be closed to prevent over-exposure. It also should provide users with greater control over depth of field, which refers to how sharp a subject appears in the foreground compared to the background.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is now moving ahead with plans to bring the technology to next-generation iPhones and is now discussing components with suppliers. The variable camera is reportedly set to be made by LG Innotech and Foxconn, while the actuator is to be manufactured by Chinese companies Luxshare ICT and Sunny Optical.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has never used a variable aperture on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> camera before. The main cameras on all of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models have a fixed aperture of ƒ/1.78, and the lens is always fully open and shooting with this aperture. Samsung Electronics previously brought a variable aperture camera to its Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S10 models in 2018 and 2019, but due to increased thickness and high price, it dropped the feature in 2020.<br/>

The report corroborates a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/iphone-18-pro-rumored-camera-upgrade/">rumor</a> from Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> shared in December last year. The &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max are expected to be announced alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> 2 and Apple's first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in the fall of 2026.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/etnews-com/">ETNews</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/iphone-18-pros-major-camera-upgrade/">iPhone 18 Pro&#039;s Major Camera Upgrade to Be Variable Aperture</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pros-major-camera-upgrade-to-be-variable-aperture.2469145/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
