<p>The continuous news about agencies like the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Science Foundation having their funding cut and their <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/04/cancellation-of-neh-grants-begins/">grants being rescinded</a>, the Trump administration&#8217;s attacks on academic freedom, plus the <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/03/25/stanley-from-yale-to-toronto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile emigration</a> of some US academics, has created a marketing opportunity that non-US institutions of higher education are starting to take advantage of.<span id="more-53825"></span></p>

<p>The message they&#8217;re sending is: &#8220;hey US academics, if you&#8217;re worried about lack of funding and freedom in the Unite States, come work here!&#8221;</p>
<p>And that message is sometimes directed specifically at philosophers.</p>
<p>For example, this is from a recent ad from Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland circulated on <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/philosophy/philos-l/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PHILOS-L</a> and posted on their <a href="https://incet.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/aktualnosci/-/journal_content/56_INSTANCE_l13JTNLQWt7Q/137114104/158605288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>:</p>
