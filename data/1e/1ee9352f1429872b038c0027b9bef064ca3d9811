<li>They sit over your ears, not in them</li>
<li>That way, you can remain aware of your environment</li>
<li>Monster claims the sound is good</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: Hmm… maybe if you put them on a shaker and really crank the bass to shake it? But probably not</li>
</ul><h1>It's Over</h1><p>Check out this little tidbit we found in <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/wearing-earbuds-all-the-time-audiologists-wax-on-about-the-impact-1.7154943">an article from the CBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like with cotton swabs, pushing something into your ear can push wax back into the ear canal. If your ears don’t produce much wax, in general, using in-ear headphones may not cause earwax buildup or blockage. But for many people, especially those who use in-ear headphones frequently, earwax can build up and cause problems that could send you to a doctor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author, in the next paragraph, clarifies that “cerumen” is just the technical term for earwax. And wow, what a difference it makes, right? If someone said, “I’ve got some earwax coming out of my ear,” I’d think it was a little gross. “I’m dealing with some cerumen leakage,” on the other hand? I’d be looking for a hazmat suit.</p>
<p>But anyway, the term isn’t what’s important. It’s the content. Put earbuds in your ears, and you might cause some wax blockage or an infection.</p>
<p>Do we, as a frequent dealer of buds, feel bad about the potential pain we’ve caused by offering so many varieties of Bluetooth Q-tips over the years? Nope, not at all.</p>
<p>Because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We don’t control how often and for how long you shove those things in there; and…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We offered that ear-cleaning system a couple times.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, we plead not guilty.</p>
<p>Still, we wanted to offer an alternative: these Monster Clarity Fit Open Air Conduction Wireless Headphones.</p>
<p>Basically, what we have here are a couple flat earbuds connected by a neckband that sit <em>over</em> your ears rather than in them. This allows you to remain “connected to your environment” while also delivering “high-definition sound with rich details and immersive bass.”</p>
<p>Is this entirely true?</p>
<p>Well, consider the fact that you found them for sale on Meh. And yes, we did just sell Beats the other day, but not for $20.</p>
<p>Honestly, best case scenario: these are awesome and you use them all the time. Worst case scenario: they’re just okay, but at least allow you to listen to a podcast while doing some chores around the house without shoving something into your ear canal. Either way, $20 seems fair.</p>
<p>So buy some and give your buds a break.</p>
