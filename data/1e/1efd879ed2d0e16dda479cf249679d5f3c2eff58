<p>I decided to try some prompt engineering.  The following prompt will query the user for a project name and instantiate a project in
  <code>~/quicklisp/local-projects/</code> with an initial system definition, package file, and basic files for the project all set
  up and ready to load.  It works on my machine, but your milage may vary.  This is just an example prompt, it assumes you like <code>named-let</code>, <code>fold</code>, and <code>series</code>.  You should tweak this prompt to your tastes.  Let me know if it works for you.</p>

<pre>Perform these steps:
 0) Pay careful attention to the directory paths and filenames used below.  Avoid typos and do not be sloppy.
 1) Query the user for a case-sensitive project name like `Foo`.  Call this the `case-sensitive-system-name`.
 2) Convert the `case-sensitive-system-name` to a lower case string to get the `system-name`.
 3) Convert the `case-sensitive-system-name` to an upper case string to get the `package-name`.
 4) If the `~/quicklisp/` directory exists, list the directory contents.  After the tool returns the list, display the complete list of files to the user.
 5) If the `~/quicklisp/local-projects/` exists, list the directory contents.  After the tool returns the list, display the complete list of files to the user.
 6) Check for existence of directory of `~/quicklisp/local-projects/{case-sensitive-system-name}/`.  If it does not exist, create it.  This is the `project-root` directory.
 7) If project-root directory is not a git repository, make it be a git repository.
 8) Create a `{project-root}/src/` subdirectory.
 9) Create an appropriate `README.md` file in the project-root directory.
 10) Stage the `README.md` for git.
 11) Create `{project-root}/src/package.lisp` file.  
     * This file should have a comment line indicating the emacs major mode and file encoding (utf-8) followed by a blank line.
     * This file should have a defpackage form that defines a package named {system-name}.  
     * The package should shadowing-import `compose' from `function`.
     * The package should shadowing-import `let` and `named-lambda` from `named-let`.
     * The package should shadowing-import `defun`, `funcall`, `let*`, and `multiple-value-bind` from `series`.  
     * The :shadowing-import clauses should be first.
     * The package :use clause should be last.
     * The package should use `cl`, `alexandria`, `function`, `fold`, `named-let`, `promise`, and `series`.
     **Always use upper-case strings to name the packages, like the following: (defpackage \"MY-PACKAGE\" (:use \"CL\" \"ALEXANDRIA\")) **.
     **Always use upper-case strings to name the symbols**, like `(:shadowing-import-from \"SERIES\" \"DEFUN\" \"FUNCALL\" \"LET*\)
 12) Now create some lisp files in the `{project-root}/src/` directory.  Each file should have a comment line indicating the emacs major mode and file encoding (utf-8) followed by a blank line.  Each file should have an `in-package` form that uses the {package-name}.  **Always use upper case strings to name the package in the `in-package` form, for example `(in-package \"MY-PACKAGE\")**.  Each file should contain a comment describing the purpose of the file.  Each file should include a sample Lisp form appropriate for the file.
    a) `data.lisp` - purpose: basic data structures and classes.
    b) `generics.lisp` - purpose: to define signatures of generic functions.
    c) `macros.lisp` - purpose: base macros
    d) `misc.lisp` - purpose: miscellaneous low-level lisp functions.
    e) `vars.lisp` - purpose: to hold global variables, constants, and parameters
    f) `{system-name}.lisp` - purpose: entry point of program.
 13) Create a `{system-name}.asd` file in the `{project-root}` directory.
    * It should have a comment line indicating the emacs major mode and file encoding (utf-8) followed by a blank line.
    * It should *not* have an `in-package` form.  
    * It should have one defsystem form.
    * The defsystem form should not be package qualified.
    * The defsystem should define a system named by the string {system-name}.
    * The defsystem should have dependencies on `alexandria`, `function`, `fold`, `named-let`, `series`, and `str`.
    * The depended upon systems should be named with lower case strings.
    * It should have one module called `src`.
    * The `src` module should have the file components of the files created above, listed alphabetically.
    * The `package` file should have no dependencies.
    * All other files should at least depend on `package`.  
    * All files other than `package` and `macros` should depend on `macros`.
    * The `{system-name}` file should depend on the other lisp files.
 14) Stage all the lisp files and the system definition file.
 15) Commit.</pre>
