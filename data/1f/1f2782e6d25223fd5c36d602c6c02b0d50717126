Apple has made several updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, and it has AutoMix, which has become one of the most popular additions. &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; also features the Liquid Glass redesign like the rest of Apple's apps, along with new translation features and other quality of life improvements.<br/>

<h2 id="automix">AutoMix</h2><br/>
AutoMix is an upgrade to the crossfade feature in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, and it is designed to provide more seamless song transitions. It transitions from one song to another as the song that's playing ends, using time stretching and beat matching for an undetectable shift.<br/>
<br/>

Apple says that AutoMix is meant to work like a DJ, with songs transitioning at the "perfect moment" based on an on-device analysis of the key and tempo of the music.<br/>
<br/>
AutoMix can be enabled when opening up the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app for the first time after installing &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The feature isn't perfect and it works better with some genres than others, but it is a work in progress that Apple is improving over time. AutoMix is not an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> feature, but it does require an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription.<br/>

<h2 id="lyric_translation">Lyric Translation</h2><br/>
If you're listening to a song in a different language, you can now open up the lyrics and get a real-time translation so you know what it's about. The translated lyrics are displayed alongside the original lyrics.<br/>

<h2 id="lyric_pronunciation">Lyric Pronunciation</h2><br/>
For songs in another language, you can also get a phonetic pronunciation guide for singing them aloud, which is useful when taking advantage of the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Sing karaoke feature.<br/>

<h2 id="pinned_favorites">Pinned Favorites</h2><br/>
There's now an option to pin up to six playlists, albums, artists, or songs to the top of the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; library.<br/>
