New data from <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/new-iphone-model-us-sales-data-welcome">Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP)</a> suggests Apple's iPhone 16e is off to a strong start, capturing 7% of U.S. iPhone sales in its first partial quarter of availability. The new mid-range offering outperformed the iPhone SE's share from the same quarter last year.<br/>

The entire iPhone 16 lineup, now consisting of five models with the addition of the 16e, accounted for 74% of total U.S. iPhone sales in the March 2025 quarter. It's a marked increase from the 68% share held by the four iPhone 15 models during the same period in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
While the 16e drove much of this growth, CIRP's data shows some surprising shifts across the lineup. The standard iPhone 16 saw a decent boost, climbing to 20% of sales compared to just 14% for the iPhone 15 in the previous year's quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Apple's high-end models had an unexpected decline. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max together accounted for 38% of iPhone sales, down from 45% for the iPhone 15 Pro models a year earlier. The iPhone 16 Pro specifically dropped from 22% to 17% market share.<br/>

The numbers suggest Apple's strengthening of its mid-range offerings may be working overall, with more buyers choosing the standard iPhone 16 over the pricier Pro models. At the same time, the 16e appears to be wooing customers who previously might have opted for older models.<br/>
<br/>
Legacy iPhones – defined as models more than a year old – fell to 26% of U.S. sales, down from 32% the year before. The decline coincides with Apple's streamlining of its iPhone lineup, which included discontinuing the iPhone SE and the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus during the quarter.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirp/">CIRP</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-16e-sales-outperform-iphone-se-yoy/">iPhone 16e Sales Outperform SE in First Quarter YoY, Pro Models Decline</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-sales-outperform-se-in-first-quarter-yoy-pro-models-decline.2455874/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
