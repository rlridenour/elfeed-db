<p>I have just released FSet 1.6.0, which completes the work on CHAMP sets and maps that I started months ago.</p><p>CHAMP is a hash-based data structure by Michael Steindorfer, that improves a little on Phil Bagwell's widely-used HAMT.&nbsp; (The HAMT is used, for example, by Clojure.)</p><p>See <a href="https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/fset/fset/-/merge_requests/1">the GitLab MR</a>&nbsp; for the details of how to use it.</p><p>I did some quick micro-benchmarking, using sets of integers, comparing CHAMP against my older weight-balanced trees.&nbsp; On lookup (testing whether a value is in the set), CHAMP is about twice as fast at size 4, growing to almost 5x faster at size 2048.&nbsp; On update (adding an element to the set, with about a 25% chance that it's already there), CHAMP is roughly even with WB at size 4, but over 40% faster at size 2048.</p><p>So to summarize, there's a significant and welcome improvement in update performance, and quite a remarkable improvement in lookup performance.&nbsp; W00t!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
