<p>This week we got the third iOS 26 beta, and, unsurprisingly, Apple continues to tamp down a bit on Liquid Glass. In the below image, from&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/07/liquid-glass-in-ios-26-beta-3-is-much-less-dramatic-as-apple-optimizes-redesign-for-usability/">Zac Hall at 9to5 Mac</a>, you can see the clear trend toward legibility.</p>

<p>This comes as a surprise to nobody that pays attention to Apple Beta cycles. They always start at an extreme with beta 1 and slowly dial it back not just in the beta process but also over the process of years with new software iterations.</p>



<p>I continue to generally enjoy Liquid Glass on my beta devices. My favorite part of this years visual overhaul: whimsy.</p>
