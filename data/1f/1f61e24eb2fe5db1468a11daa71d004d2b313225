<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A gift unwrapped, a book finished, and a hobby remembered&hellip;all of which is to say our stories and myths are important.

<p>
Anyone who tells you that making time for joy — however you define it — is a
distraction or a betrayal has no idea what they’re talking about.  During the
darkest days of the AIDS Crisis, we buried our friends in the morning, we
protested in the afternoon, and we danced at night.  The dance kept us in the
fight because it was the dance we were fighting for.  It didn’t look like we
were going to win then and we did.  It doesn’t feel like we’re going to win now
but we could.  Keep fighting, keep dancing.

<p>At the end of <time datetime="2025-01" title="2025-01">January</time>, I found and opened a gift from my brother in-law and
sister in-law: a set of tiger’s eye dice: my first set of stone.  They feel
ancient, almost primal (though their corners are sharp and crisp telling of the
mechanical precision of their crafting).</p>
<p>These 7 dice stoked and tended the embers of my lifelong hobby.</p>
<p>It seems like a lifetime ago when I wrote 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2024/10/14/the-great-pendragon-campaign-year-490/">The Great Pendragon Campaign: Year 490</a></cite>.  And for awhile I set it aside.  But I realized that I need to dive back
into the things that bring me joy, and <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">Role Playing Games</a></span> (<abbr title="Role Playing Games">RPGs</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Role Playing Games”" title="Other site-wide references of “Role Playing Games”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-RPG">&#128214;</a></small>)
 are one of those things.</p>
<p>I’d love to re-engage with a face to face table where I could play, but its not
quite the season.  I’ve considered playing over Discord, but I’m not quite ready
for that.</p>
<p>I recently finished <cite data-id="0D14E25B-DD86-445E-BD3F-AAE165774566">Worlds of Arthur</cite> by Guy Halsall; a bit of a mythical let down as the author lays on research that says
historical Arthur is very unlikely to have ever existed.</p>
<p>But the thing is: Arthur exists; perhaps not as a historical figure, but as
something more.  Just as Superman exists.  And Clark Kent.</p>
<p>The stories we share hold kernels of truth as well as longing; touching on deep
seeded myths, values, and ethics.  And that is why I turn to <abbr title="Role Playing Games">RPGs</abbr>
: for
story-telling and myth-making.  To interrogate the human condition with a set of
rules and framework.</p>
<p>To find out “What do you do?” in a fantastical make believe.</p>
<p>It is also why I wish to play in the analogue, to touch on those fire-side
moments in which mine and your pre-historic ancestors shared and made the myths
that still reverberate through our psychic narrative.  A narrative that we’re
witnessing homogenized.</p>
