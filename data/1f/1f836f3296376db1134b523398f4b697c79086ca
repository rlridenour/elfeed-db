<p>Israeli air strikes hit multiple locations across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, with hospitals and local emergency services reporting dozens of Palestinian deaths, including children, even as a ceasefire agreement remains in place. Reports described strikes on an apartment building in Gaza City and a tent area in Khan Younis, among other sites. Israel’s military confirmed carrying out strikes and said it targeted Hamas commanders or acted in response to what it described as a Hamas ceasefire violation, while Hamas described the attacks as a renewed violation of the truce and urged mediators to press Israel to stop. The escalation came as attention focused on the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, which several outlets said was due to reopen as part of the ceasefire arrangements, offering a potential pathway for increased movement and aid if implemented as planned.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eJz2DHxU5X-6U5fPi4tX3BuTWxaA0xZPZHWI7kValwW54eOHOvJlhlmyknMBmn3vVOMdhVsm9fy2ObpCU1F_FaRp3dICyTsM6QpnkJRXonyHK15TWZLZrIYfbXHhA9LOzw7PjrXN1tb16V5sNDgS4e-6cp_lHloKsMIHE0Z46kC0hP5xB4_-tedzFo2d18n7iXabPfkapCXXnLy5PP5QXP1AO81zRwpvg2HNtejtlyh9rTRTC6mZlR2yH_fz7in8plmAPpL8Rq5RppKXAg' alt='Rescuers and onlookers inspect the debris of Sheikh Radwan police station in Gaza City on Saturday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Police station hit: Palestinian civil defence said a strike hit the Sheikh Radwan police station in Gaza City, killing police officers and detainees, as responders searched debris for additional victims.</li><li>Family shelter strike: Gaza’s health ministry said a strike on a tent shelter in southern Gaza killed members of a displaced family, including a child and an elderly person.</li><li>Ceasefire strain: Several reports described Saturday as among the deadliest days since an October ceasefire/truce framework, underscoring how violence has continued despite the agreement moving through phases.</li><li>Targets disputed: Israel said it was striking Hamas-linked targets, while Palestinian health and rescue officials emphasized civilian casualties, including women and children, arriving at hospitals.</li><li>Border focus: The strikes came just ahead of the expected reopening of the Rafah crossing, a step tied in some reports to ceasefire implementation and humanitarian access.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli military: The military confirmed the strikes and said it targeted Hamas figures or acted in response to what it described as a Hamas ceasefire violation.
