<p>I found myself thinking about satellite connectivity during today’s Apple event, during which the company announced that the Apple Watch Ultra 3 would include the feature. Back when the feature debuted on the iPhone 14 line, Apple said it would remain free for two years. When that period was up, <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2023/11/apple-extends-emergency-sos-coverage-for-iphone-14-users/">Apple extended free coverage for another year</a>. Which brings us to this year! Will people have to finally start paying?</p>
<p>The Verge’s Jay Peters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/775309/apple-iphone-14-15-satellite-connectivity-free">found the answer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 users are getting another year of free access to satellite connectivity features, according to a footnote on Apple’s newsroom posts for the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro. “The free trial will be extended for iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 users who have activated their device in a country that supports Apple’s satellite features prior to 12 a.m. PT on September 9, 2025,” Apple says.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep, we’re going to keep kicking that can right on down the road—probably forever, at least as far as the Emergency SOS features go—as I said previously, somebody dying because they didn’t pay the fee for satellites would put a real damper on that keynote montage.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that while the Apple Watch Ultra 3’s satellite features are likewise free for two years, using the Find My or texting features requires a carrier plan. Moreover, as Apple’s footnote reads: “To send and receive SMS/MMS from cellular models of Apple Watch over satellite, your paired iPhone must be powered on and connected to Wi-Fi or an active cellular network, but your iPhone doesn’t need to be nearby.” So you can’t just rely on your Apple Watch Ultra 3 for all your satellite texting needs, I guess.</p>
<p>It’ll be interesting to see if Apple ever does start directly charging for non-emergency satellite features, but I think it’s going to be a while yet before we find out.</p>
