Apple is reportedly evaluating a tougher display film technology for its first foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as it tests materials that could differentiate the durability and feel of the screen from rival devices.<br/>

According to a new supply chain report from <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=51990"><em>The Elec</em></a>, Apple is evaluating transparent polyimide film as a protective layer that would sit on top of the ultra-thin glass used in the foldable display. The report says the company is currently testing two options for this outer film: polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and clear polyimide (CPI).<br/>
<br/>
Most of today's foldable displays use ultra-thin glass to improve clarity and rigidity, but the glass still requires a flexible polymer film on top to prevent scratches and damage. This is the layer that users actually touch, making it a key factor in overall durability and feel.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung currently uses PET film as the protective layer on top of the ultra-thin glass in its Galaxy Z Fold and Galaxy Z Flip devices. <em>The Elec</em> says Apple's evaluation of CPI is rooted in a wish to differentiate its approach. CPI is more expensive than PET, but has better surface hardness and scratch resistance.<br/>
<br/>
Kolon Industry has apparently emerged as a potential supplier of the material. The company previously built a mass production line for CPI film after anticipating strong demand from upcoming foldable devices. China-based Lens Technology is expected to supply the ultra-thin glass for the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and will handle bonding the final protective film to the glass.<br/>
<br/>
The final decision on the protective film is expected to be made soon as Apple continues testing remaining components of the first foldable ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌. Other rumors suggest that the device will feature a 7.8-inch crease-free inner display, a 5.5-inch cover display, ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>‌, two rear cameras, the A20 chip, and the "C2" modem. It is expected to launch alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj;‌ Pro Max later this year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/">The Elec</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/tougher-display-for-foldable-iphone/">Apple Hoping to Outdo Rivals With Tougher Display for Foldable iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-hoping-to-outdo-rivals-with-tougher-display-for-foldable-iphone.2477222/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
