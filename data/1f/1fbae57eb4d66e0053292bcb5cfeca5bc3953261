W- has been volunteering for <a href="https://www.bikebrigade.ca/">Bike Brigade</a> for a
number of months now. A+ and I occasionally tag
along. It's encouraging to be part of this
initiative to deliver groceries and other
essentials to people who need help. One of the
organizers spoke at this panel discussion about
<a href="https://www.yorku.ca/cfr/events/creating-sustainable-futures-in-unsustainable-times-bicycles-justice-resistance/">bicycles and social justice</a> organized by York
University.

<p>
Bicycles hold immense potential for addressing today’s pressing social and climate justice challenges. However, coordinating and sustaining grassroots cycling movements remains difficult, especially as global development aid for climate action and broader humanitarian work rapidly declines. Indeed, we are living in a moment of profound global injustice, where imperialism, colonial violence, and systemic oppression dictate whose struggles and resistances are recognized. In this context, grassroots organizing and local self-determination have become more pressing than ever.  This webinar explores how bicycling serves as a tool for justice, sustainability, and collective resistance. Indeed, we see bicycling/mobility justice in responding to uncertain global contexts, including a rise in right-wing fascist governments, climate change and its unequal effects on vulnerable communities, and an escalation on anti-immigrant policies and sentiments. Those most affected – racialized, Indigenous, low-income, and gender-diverse communities – are leading powerful mobility justice movements. They are reclaiming space, resisting exclusion, and challenging systemic inequalities through cycling activism.  Speakers will share insights from different regions, highlighting how bicycles are more than transportation – they are a means of survival, self-determination, and community care. This conversation will thus bring together activists, researchers, and practitioners striving to make transportation more accessible and equitable.

I like that so many people are thinking about this
from different perspectives around the world: from
the ground up with the experiences of people who
are out there, to groups like <a href="https://www.criticalmassnairobi.org/">Critical Mass
Nairobi</a> and <a href="https://www.bikebrigade.ca/">Bike Brigade</a> where people can work
together to make things better, to academics and
urban planners who can think about how systems are
designed.
</p>

<p>
We probably lean more towards the very small scale
end of things, for now: whatever little deliveries
we can squeeze into our schedule. A+ is
particularly proud of putting things in her own
basket and also hauling a full bag of groceries
once we get to the recipient's building. Who
knows, maybe we'll find ourselves moving along
that pipeline from volunteer grocery deliveries to
community organizing&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I don't know if a recording will get
posted, but if I come across one, I'll update
this.
