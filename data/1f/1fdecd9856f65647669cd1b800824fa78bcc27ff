<p>President Trump has launched a new &quot;Trump Gold Card&quot; programme that offers foreign nationals and certain corporate applicants expedited US residency and a pathway to citizenship in exchange for large, upfront payments starting at about $1 million per person. The initiative, framed by the administration as a way to attract wealthy individuals and skilled talent while raising money for public purposes, requires applicants to demonstrate that they will provide a &quot;substantial benefit&quot; to the United States, such as investment or job creation, before qualifying for the fast-tracked process. Officials say funds collected will go directly to the US government, with President Trump predicting that the programme could generate billions of dollars for a Treasury-run account earmarked for domestic projects. The scheme sits alongside, and in some cases replaces, older investor visa categories and is being pitched particularly strongly to international students and professionals who currently face strict limits on staying in the US after their studies or temporary work visas end.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8-gX2p1uFB5dheQwsKpGpPEZUVpZvfOhh6vsjF9-pD8_czk18JF9mO0Z2er_ynUdKZA7Id9OBy3SygDviVe2FFvZMjyx2qGMI4dF8EeUrYBYrnBetNoWBzYwjQMHIPLIcrNshIrhG2-TazmGAeuKuFVagDPRWSy3n4WYDpMST3WA4QXmTOAW2jIw' alt='President Trump speaks as the US government unveils the new Trump Gold Card visa programme focused on high-value investors.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Investment threshold: Reports describe the minimum buy-in for the Trump Gold Card at roughly $1 million per individual applicant, with higher tiers for larger family applications and corporate packages that bundle multiple visas together.</li><li>Who can apply: Eligibility focuses on high-net-worth individuals, their immediate family members, and companies willing to sponsor key staff, provided they pass standard US security and background vetting and can show significant economic benefit to the country.</li><li>Use of funds: President Trump said all revenue from the programme will be channelled into a special Treasury Department account to finance domestic priorities he characterises as &quot;positive for the country&quot; rather than going to private intermediaries or fee-based middlemen.</li><li>Appeal to Indian students: Highlighting what he called a &quot;ridiculous&quot; situation in which many international graduates must leave the US after their studies, President Trump specifically pitched the Gold Card as a way to help Indian students and other skilled foreigners remain in America if they or their sponsors can meet the financial and eligibility conditions.</li><li>Shift from older visas: Analysts describe the Gold Card as a revamped alternative to legacy investor visas such as EB-5-style programmes, streamlining the process by replacing multi-step investment structures with direct contributions and faster processing for those who qualify.</li></ul><blockquote>All funds from the gold card program will go to the U.S. government, where we can do things positive for the country. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He promotes the Gold Card as a way to attract wealthy immigrants and retain top graduates while raising billions of dollars that, he says, will be used for projects that benefit the United States rather than private intermediaries.
