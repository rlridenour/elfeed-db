 <i>As we mourn for the lives lost this week in Paris, Lord, hear our prayer.</i>
</p>

 <p>
Almighty God,
</p>

 <p>
We grieve this week, <br></br>
crying with those who suffer, <br></br>
lamenting with those who mourn.
</p>

 <p>
Even in our anger, <br></br>
May we always seek justice, <br></br>
and never revenge; <br></br>
healing, not harm; <br></br>
and a measured response, <br></br>
instead of thoughtless reaction.
</p>

 <p>
When circumstances tempt us <br></br>
to sink into the depths of despair, <br></br>
may we hear the prophet’s voice, <br></br>
as he surveyed the destruction of Jerusalem <br></br>
yet still found hope,
</p>

 <p>
“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, <br></br>
his mercies never come to an end; <br></br>
they are new every morning, <br></br>
great is your faithfulness.”
</p>

 <p>
When faced with the choice <br></br>
between burning hatred <br></br>
and callous indifference, <br></br>
remind us again that there is a third way, <br></br>
the way of love.
</p>

 <p>
And may that love shine so brightly <br></br>
that the entire world will know, <br></br>
the light still shines in the darkness, <br></br>
and the darkness will never defeat it.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
