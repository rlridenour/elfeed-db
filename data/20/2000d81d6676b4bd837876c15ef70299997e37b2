The thin, light <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> sold so poorly that Apple has decided to delay the launch of the next-generation &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; that was scheduled to come out alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro, reports<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-delays-release-next-iphone-air-amid-weak-sales"> <em>The Information</em></a>.<br/>

Apple initially planned to release a new &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; in fall 2026, but now that's not going to happen. <br/>
<br/>
Since the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; launched in September, there have been reports of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/iphone-air-supply-chain-cuts/">poor sales and manufacturing cuts</a>. Apple's supply chain has scaled back shipments and production. Apple supplier Foxconn has reportedly dismantled all but one and a half of its production lines for the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;, and all production is expected to be stopped at the end of the month. Luxshare, another supplier, stopped production at the end of October.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was counting on the novel look of the device to spark interest, because it features the first substantial design update that we've seen to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> and an all-display design in 2017. Creating a super thin 5.6mm &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; required compromises, so the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; has a smaller battery and a single-lens rear camera, but it still has a high price tag. Apple priced it starting at &#36;999, and that appears to be more than customers are willing to pay for style without substance. The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is only &#36;100 cheaper than the &#36;1,099 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, which has a triple-lens rear camera and much better battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not been able to land on a fourth &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that will sell well alongside the standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models. Apple experimented with a smaller 5.4-inch &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; mini that suffered from disappointing sales, then moved on to the larger "Plus" &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that served as a more affordable version of the Pro Max. Plus models also failed, leading to the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has already been planning for a split launch for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; starting with the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; models. The &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro, &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max, and foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; are planned for fall 2026, while the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18e will be held until early 2027. It's possible that the next-generation &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; will come out alongside the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; in the spring.<br/>

Apple has been working on a second-generation version of the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; with a lighter weight, vapor chamber cooling, and a larger battery capacity, but Apple could rethink the design.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/10/next-generation-iphone-air-delayed/">iPhone Air Sales Are So Bad That Apple&#039;s Delaying the Next-Generation Version</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-sales-are-so-bad-that-apples-delaying-the-next-generation-version.2470895/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
