Selecting Emacs windows using ace-window

<p>
Recently I&#39;ve been building a simple Emacs config for myself, along
the way I re-discovered some fantastic packages, for example, I found
that <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window">ace-window</a> is a simple yet powerful package to enhance
the default <code class="verbatim">other-window</code> command to select other windows quickly
when it has more than two windows in a frame.</p>
<p>
I replaced the key binding of <code class="verbatim">other-window</code> to ace-window by simply
doing <code>(global-set-key (kbd &#34;C-x o&#34;) #&#39;ace-window)</code>, then when there are &gt;2
windows, it will show a white-in-red number at the top-left corner for
every window, hit the number (1, 2, 3, …) and then Emacs will select the
corresponding window (as demonstrated in the above screenshot).</p>
