<p>Before the iPhone, Apple took a shot at making the iPod a device that could do more than just play music. Amongst it: playing games.<sup id="fnref-36505-applecares"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-36505-applecares" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup> If you find yourself feeling nostalgic for that era, you can now revisit those classic games  designed for the iPod—it just takes jumping through a few hoops, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/all-54-lost-clickwheel-ipod-games-have-now-been-preserved-for-posterity/">as Ars Technica’s Kyle Orland reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now that the consolidated clickwheel game collection is complete, though, owners of any iPod 5G+ or iPod Nano 3G+ should be able to sync the complete library to their personal device completely offline, without worrying about any server checks from Apple. They can do that by setting up a Virtual Machine using these GitHub instructions or by downloading this torrented Internet Archive collection and creating their own Virtual Machine from the files contained therein.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The project has recently added the last missing game, <em>Real Soccer 2009</em>, to the archive, so it’s now complete. Apple has in the past revived <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/07/know-when-to-holdem/">one of those old games</a>, but I wouldn’t be holding my breath for the rest of them to resurface in the App Store anytime soon.</p>
