<p>If you’re an Emacs user (which I know you are), especially one who lives in <code>dired-mode</code>, you’re probably familiar with the quick power of <code>isearch</code> for finding files or directories. But if you’re like me, you might have noticed a tiny speed bump in the workflow: after finding a file or directory with <code>isearch</code>, you would typically have to hit <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> to exit the search, and then <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> again to open the entry. That’s two steps for something that feels like it should be one and this has been a very minor annoyance for me for a very long time now.</p>

<p>I had a little time to shave some more yak hair, so lets try and address this!</p>
<p>The solution I came up with was to add a bit of advice to <code>isearch-exit</code>, so now, when you’re in <code>dired-mode</code> and you use <code>isearch</code> to locate a file or directory, pressing <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> will both exit the search <strong>and</strong> immediately open the file or directory, no need for a second confirmation.</p>
<p>Here’s the magic!</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;In dired mode, enter directory or open file after isearch.&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (when (<span style="color:#a6e22e">eq</span> major-mode <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;dired-mode</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    (let ((file (dired-get-file-for-visit)))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      (when file
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        (dired-find-file)))))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The only thing I am a little worried about are the side effects, but I guess we shall see&hellip;</p>
<p>And another thing, now my <code>dired</code> navigation is one step smoother; how much time generally is it going to save me? Was it worth the effort?.</p>
<p>Let’s say, conservatively, that I have pressed that extra Enter 100 times each day. Each press takes, say, 150 ms, accounting for human reaction times, even though it isn’t really a reaction, more of a muscle memory response.</p>
<p>Let’s do the calculations! I have no idea why I’m doing this, but maybe I can validate the amount of time I spent on this for future time-saving gains. Maybe it will make me feel better about the countless hours of yak shaving I have done over many years (with Emacs, of course, although I do have a yak in the garden shed that really needs some attention!)</p>
<p>So, the savings are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day:</strong> 15 seconds</li>
<li><strong>Week:</strong> 105 seconds</li>
<li><strong>Month:</strong> 7 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Year:</strong> 1 hour 24 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, the yearly total is probably about the amount of time I actually took to implement this, so that means in a year I will be making productivity gains! Sweeeeeeet!</p>
