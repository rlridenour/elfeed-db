<p>Security forces in Benin quickly foiled a short-lived coup attempt in Cotonou on Sunday, when a group of mutinous soldiers briefly seized state television, claimed to oust President Patrice Talon and announced the suspension of the constitution, citing security concerns in the country’s north. The putschists reportedly targeted senior officers first, killing the wife of the president’s military chief of staff during an attack on his home and abducting the army chief of staff and another senior commander, who were freed the following morning. Loyal units of the Republican Guard clashed with the rebels as they tried to storm the presidential residence, leading to casualties on both sides before the mutineers retreated and attempted to regroup at a military base outside the capital. Benin’s government says regional partners, including Nigerian airstrikes against rebel armoured vehicles and French intelligence and logistical assistance coordinated with other West African leaders, played a key role in restoring control, and the authorities are now pursuing fugitive soldiers while preparing for elections scheduled in April 2026.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/NT4zN2ogW5VVVEk-72YWhZknTbUB98_f-4lgX-sIWQaPyXhfNrc8hX8-Nw0_1HxparmY-3cfXTieynVkuzKiLgF2x74Z64_0frvq03aNvjV-FPLAvkzwoovtalOUFMZjKbUr3_JZkGjkzm0nt9UOEos8UHILMtMTVqBQEVQX8oPTJ1n1xpI32ZaKhtet72DLg-dbafmEwcEwLg_SyPFRrRhM31VLO-x0SJO_4sDYqkuj8i3xHfmkdQ4VHw' alt='Supporters of President Patrice Talon rally in Cotonou after Benin’s armed forces thwarted a coup attempt.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Nigeria’s air support: Benin’s government reported that Nigerian fighter jets disabled armoured vehicles used by mutinous soldiers after loyal troops encircled the Togbin base where the rebels tried to open a new front.</li><li>French coordination role: An aide to President Emmanuel Macron said France provided surveillance, observation and logistical help to Benin’s armed forces and led a coordination effort that included calls with key regional leaders as the coup unfolded.</li><li>Regional mobilisation: Neighbouring states and the ECOWAS bloc moved troops or support assets to back Benin’s authorities, marking a departure from the muted responses seen after recent successful coups elsewhere in West Africa.</li><li>Casualties and arrests: Authorities said the overnight clashes caused deaths and injuries among both loyal forces and the mutineers, and security services are now hunting coup leader Colonel Pascal Tigri and other fugitives after detaining several participants.</li><li>Democratic concerns: Analysts note that, although Benin has been regarded as a relatively stable democracy in an unstable region, recent tensions over electoral rules, governance and security challenges contributed to the atmosphere in which the coup plotters acted.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Benin: Officials framed the mutiny as an illegal attempt to overthrow elected institutions and stressed that loyal forces, supported by regional partners, had restored constitutional order and would track down those still at large.
