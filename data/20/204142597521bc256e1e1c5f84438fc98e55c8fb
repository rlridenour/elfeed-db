When her daughter announced that she intended to learn to read, Rum Godden wrote this letter to her:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
You see, when you learn to read you will be born again into another world and it is a pity to be born again so
young. I should put off reading, if I were you. As soon as you learn to read you will not see anything again quite
as it is. It will all the time be altered by what you have read and you will never be quite alone again. I should
stay by yourself a bit longer if I were you. 
</p>
</blockquote>
