<p>Two weeks ago, I <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/09/28/tiddlywiki-and-friction-compared-to.html">wrote</a> about some of the challenges I have when working with TiddlyWiki. In a nutshell, TiddlyWiki is better when you want other people to read technical documentation you otherwise much more comfortable writing inside Emacs org-mode.</p>
<p>My problem is that converting org-mode to WikiText (the way TiddlyWiki works) is a friction point, and I am not willing to leave the comforts of org-mode in favor of TiddlyWiki&rsquo;s UI and hotkeys. They are OK, but they do not compare to Emacs and good muscle memory.</p>
<p>The solution (or rather, a workaround) that I found is to export my org-mode buffer to HTML with org-mode, and then let TiddlyWiki handle the rest. I <a href="https://taonaw.gitlab.io/taonah/#Working%20with%20HTML">documented</a> this process in my wiki as part of recording the workflow.</p>
<p>There are still a few issues, of course. Certain HTML tags still need to be converted to WikiText (as I noted in the example in the wiki article) to reflect CSS options that otherwise do not trigger with the raw HTML code yet; this is something I can probably fix down the line. The other issue is that certain TiddlyWiki functions, such as integrated macros and lists, cannot be written inside org-mode because they contain square brackets that serve as links within org-mode.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s easy enough to fix those in the exported temporary HTML buffer before pasting back into a TiddlyWiki tiddler.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been fun going back to TiddlyWiki and seeing some of the recent and exciting changes they&rsquo;ve introduced. I will always have a soft spot for TiddlyWiki, since it was the first personal database I tried, before I discovered Emacs org-mode.</p>
