While we have unsurprisingly yet to see any straight discounts on the just-announced M5 MacBook Pro, Best Buy is seeking to entice upgraders with some <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/kOrPRn">trade-in offers toward the new models</a>.<br/>

Best Buy is currently offering up to &#36;800 in trade-in value for a base M4 MacBook Pro, with higher-spec machines qualifying for even more. Base M3 MacBook Pro models qualify for up to &#36;600 in trade-in credit, while base M2 models qualify for up to &#36;490 and base M1 models qualify for up to &#36;300. My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total members are also eligible for an extra 10% on their trade-in value.<br/>

<br/>
The <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/APvYKx">new M5 MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,599</a>, with higher-spec stock configurations available at &#36;1,799 and &#36;1,999 price points. Pre-orders are available now ahead of a launch next Wednesday, October 22.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in">offers its own trade-in program</a> for Macs and other devices, so it's worth comparing trade-in values to determine what the best option is for you. Private sales can also frequently yield higher values for a given model, though that can come with more hassle and less security than a retail trade-in partner like Best Buy or Apple, so you need to weigh priorities when deciding how to upgrade.<br/>
