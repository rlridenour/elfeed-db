		  <p>We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come – namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour. </p>
		  <p>– John Maynard Keynes,  the essay “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren”, 1930</p>
