<p>Just a quick note on how easy it is to actually navigate Doom Emacs documentation and modules.</p>
<p>I initially was a little afraid that I will not be able to understand what each Doom module does
and there always will be some hidden functionaltiy that will be hard for me to find.</p>
<p>Fortunately there is M-x <code>M-x doom/help-search-headings</code> that allows me to search through
Doom documentation. Specifically it allows me to search through org headings of the documentation.</p>
<p>I can easily find a module I&rsquo;m interested in, let&rsquo;s say <code>lsp</code>.
Then I&rsquo;ll go there and I can see all the documentation of the module. I can see what packages will be installed and what configuration
options available for the module (e.g. <code>+eglot</code> for <code>lsp</code>).
Being in the <code>README.org</code> of a module I can also open <code>config.el</code> which is in the same directory and I&rsquo;ll be able to inspect
all the Elisp that module will add into my Emacs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to search not just headings but everything then <code>M-x doom/help-search</code> is your friend.</p>
<p>I start to like Doom more and more every day.</p>
