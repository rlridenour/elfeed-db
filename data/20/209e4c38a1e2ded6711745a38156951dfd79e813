<p id="p2">Yes, you read that right. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> has finally released an iPad version, and you know what, it looks good, too.</p>
<p id="p3"><a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-for-ipad/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announced on Instagram&rsquo;s blog today</a>, the new iPad app supports iPadOS 15.1 and later and includes the features you&rsquo;d expect like Reels and Stories, plus a new &ldquo;Following&rdquo; tab that includes sections for posts and Reels from Friends who follow you back, a &ldquo;Latest&rdquo; section that&rsquo;s sorted chronologically, and an &ldquo;All&rdquo; section. Instagram&rsquo;s messaging is supported and the extra screen real estate allows you to view your inbox and threads simultaneously. It even supports keyboards, trackpads, and the Apple Pencil.</p>

<p id="p5">I gave up any expectation that Instagram would ever be released on the iPad years ago. I never really understood the notion that it wouldn&rsquo;t work on a bigger screen, especially since what Instagram does has expanded a lot in recent years. I&rsquo;m not a big Instagram user, but I&rsquo;m glad to see it on the iPad finally. Not only does it work full screen, but with windowing coming in iPadOS 26, you&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy the more iPhone-like look if you prefer too.</p>

<p id="p7">I&rsquo;m not seeing the app on the App Store yet, but it&rsquo;s rolling out now and should be available to everyone shortly as a free download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
