 
          <p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year&mdash;the time to publish the <a href="/tags/yearnote">yearly notes</a> summarizing playtime statistics and providing a personal opinion on recent and vintage Game Of The Year (GOTY) contestants.</p>
<p><a href="/post/2023/12/2023-in-video-games">In 2023</a>, <em>Pizza Tower</em> and <em>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em> were examples of superb recent games that even made it to the <a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/top100">Top 100 List</a>, while <em>DUSK</em> and <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> scored high in the vintage list (both also on the Top 100).</p>
<p><a href="/post/2024/12/2024-in-video-games">In 2024</a>, <em>Skald</em> and the <em>Paper Mario</em> remake were the great ones, but the most memorable experience was no doubt playing <a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/games/pc/ultima-underworld/">Ultima Underworld</a> for the first time together for the DOS Game Club.</p>
<p>For 2025, the amount of games recorded on my retro gaming site remains the same as the previous year&mdash;27&mdash;but this year I also started occasionally reviewing board games that I replay at least ten times. Here&rsquo;s this year&rsquo;s collage of the games I (re)played this year in chronological order:</p>

</code></pre><p>I have yet to write a review for <em>Shotgun King</em> so let&rsquo;s keep that one out. It&rsquo;s a small indie roguelike that&rsquo;s fun but doesn&rsquo;t have a lot to offer. Also, since this post is called <em>2025 in Video Games</em>, let&rsquo;s ignore the board games for now and keep that for a future post where I summarise my Board Game Geek statistics.</p>
<p>Some more useless stats, based on user input from How Long To Beat (HLTB):</p>
<ul>
<li>total #games: 27</li>
<li>total hours: 175.8</li>
<li>average hours: 6.51</li>
<li>average a day: 0.5</li>
<li>longest game: 28.0 hours; &lsquo;Castlevania Dominus Collection&rsquo;</li>
<li>shortest game: 0.0 hours; Hoyle Card Games 2002</li>
<li>Divison by platform:
<ul>
<li>Platform: pc (5/27)</li>
<li>Platform: ds (3/27)</li>
<li>Platform: boardgames (6/27)</li>
<li>Platform: gameboycolor (1/27)</li>
<li>Platform: switch (11/27)</li>
<li>Platform: snes (1/27)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year, about 50% of my gaming time took place on the Switch. That&rsquo;s dropped to 40%. Or has it? Remove the six board games and you&rsquo;ve got 52% so nope, I&rsquo;m still primarily a Nintendo (handheld) gamer. I have a bunch of cartridges waiting to be played and I believe even a few cases still in shrink wrap (yeah I know), so for the coming year, that&rsquo;s not likely to change either. I don&rsquo;t need a Switch 2 just yet.</p>
<p>For more details on those divisions by platform, I again reused last year&rsquo;s script to generate a graph summarizing the platforms and calculates an average score (rated on 5, see <a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/about/#rating">about the rating system</a>) for each platform:</p>

<p>Most mediocre plays game from platforms where I was hunting down card games for my feature <a href="/tags/card-games">write-up on card games</a> back in September. Filtering all games that are scored as either <em>great</em> (4/5) or <em>amazing</em> (5/5), we end with the following lists, where I further cherry-picked the best of the best:</p>
<p>The <strong>Recent GOTY</strong> list:</p>
<ul>
<li>💖 Guncho (pc; 2024)</li>
<li>💖 Shogun Showdown (switch; 2023)</li>
<li>💖 Rise Of The Triad: Ludicrous Edition (switch; 2023)</li>
<li>💖 Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (switch; 2024)</li>
<li>💖 DOOM + DOOM II (pc; 2024)</li>
<li>💖 Castlevania Dominus Collection (switch; 2024)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Couch</em> &ldquo;recent&rdquo; <em>cough</em>. Yeah, again&mdash;I know. What can I say, I&rsquo;m a retro gamer, and the &ldquo;new games&rdquo; I play are usually repurposed old ones, go figure. This seems to be especially apparent this year. Those Nightdive Studios boomer shooter remakes are beyond awesome, you&rsquo;ve got to try them!</p>
<p>The <strong>Vintage GOTY</strong> list:</p>
<ul>
<li>💖 Hoyle Card Games 2002 (pc; 2002)</li>
<li>💖 Wonder Boy: The Dragon&rsquo;s Trap (switch; 2017)</li>
<li>💖 Tangle Tower (switch; 2019)</li>
<li>💖 Celeste (switch; 2018)</li>
<li>💖 Inscryption (switch; 2021)</li>
</ul>
<p>I found 2024 to be a meagre year for me when it comes to &ldquo;the great ones&rdquo;&mdash;because I don&rsquo;t play many of those within the year of release. I have the same feeling for this year, looking back at the play log. There are many great games I highly enjoyed such as <em>Wonder Boy</em> with the awesome art and music and ability to switch back and forth between retro and remastered version, or <em>Hoyle Card Games</em>, the PC classic that&rsquo;s hard to beat when it comes to trumping the trump.</p>
<p>I love <em>Celeste</em> and <em>Castlevania Dominus Collection</em> but those were replays of games I know by heart, so I&rsquo;m ruling them out. We&rsquo;ve got to draw the line somewhere.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s <em>Inscryption</em>. What a game. No, what an <em>experience</em> that was! I was on the edge of my seat almost every single in-game minute. I played it in January (read <a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/games/switch/inscryption/">my thoughts</a> but beware of the spoilers) and didn&rsquo;t encounter a game that challenged my expectations that much ever since. There&rsquo;s no need for a debate or a voting round: <em>Inscryption</em> is my &ldquo;Game of the Other Year&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/top100/">in the Top100</a>.</p>
<p>As for the GOTY of 2025-ish; that&rsquo;s got to be one of the Nightdive remakes. Both <em>Blood: Refreshed Supply</em> and the <em>Outlaws</em> remaster have been released recently and I haven&rsquo;t yet had the change to touch either of them. If I had, I think <em>Blood</em> might have been the winner as that&rsquo;s the only Build Engine game I never truly played back in the nineties.</p>
<p>Screw it. <em>DOOM + DOOM II</em> is my GOTY. Just the music alone:</p>
<figure>

<p>And that&rsquo;s from the new <em>Legacy of Rust</em> expansion. I&rsquo;ll leave the discovery of Andrew Hulshult&rsquo;s DOOM riffs up to you. Obviously, <em>DOOM + DOOM II</em> (2024) kicked out and replaced <em>DOOM</em> (1993) in the Top100.</p>
<p>Cheers to 2026. My hopes are high for opening that shrink wrap.</p>
