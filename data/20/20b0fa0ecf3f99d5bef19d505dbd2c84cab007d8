<p>Today in <a href="https://taonaw.com/on-this-day/">On This Day</a>, I wrote about <a href="https://taonaw.com/2024/04/15/attempting-not-to.html">my attempts to leave Arc Browser</a> after using it both for work and personal stuff for a couple of months. I thought their days were numbered, but they&rsquo;re still around, and as far as I can tell, enjoy a thriving community of users.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m still more comfortable using three browsers for my three categories of web surfing: Edge for work, Safari for personal, and LibreWolf (trying to keep it on Linux only) for private.</p>
