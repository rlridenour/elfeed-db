<p>While in the mood to <a href="https://xenodium.com/rinku-cli-link-previews">goof around with Emacs, CLI, and image rendering</a>, I've revised an idea to generate some sort of art from your codebase (or any text really). That is, given an image, generate a textual representation, potentially using source code as input.</p>
<p>With that, here's <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/one">one</a>: a utility to transform images into character art using text from your codebase.</p>
<p>Rather than tell you more about it, best to see it in action.</p>

<p>Just a bit of fun. That's all there is to it.</p>
<p>While I've only run it on macOS, <code>one</code>'s written in Go, so should be fairly portable. I'd love to know if you get it running on Linux. The code's on <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/one">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you're on macOS, I've added a <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> on <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/homebrew-one">GitHub</a>, so you should just be able to install with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">brew install --HEAD xenodium/one/one
</code></pre>
