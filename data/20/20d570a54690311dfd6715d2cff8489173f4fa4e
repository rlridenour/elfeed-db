<p>There are two ways to format digital text: let an app do it for you (e.g.&nbsp;select the text, then choose Bold from a menu), or do it yourself.</p>
<p>When people are discussing the merits of <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/beginners-guide-emacs" target="_blank">Emacs</a> (Org mode) or <a href="https://learnvim.irian.to" target="_blank">Vim</a>, the three main contenders for <span class="small-caps">DIY</span> text editing/formatting, I sometimes imagine geeks fighting it out with an arm wrestling competition or Paper, Scissors, Rock! Then I remember that, much like folders and tags <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/145-2025-02-24-folders-tags-index-no-debate">they’re tools, not a debate</a>.</p>
<p>Now why would you even want to wrest the formatting sceptre from the likes of Word or Pages? Because your data is too important to lock away behind a door you don’t own, that’s why.</p>
<h3 id="whats-your-poison">What’s your poison?</h3>
<p><a href="https://pkm.social/@ellane/114658518281526051" target="_blank">Last week I asked the nicest group of geeks I know</a> (they live on Mastodon; you’d like them) to complete a clean joke that begins,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Markdown, Emacs, and Vim walked into a bar…”. <em>Clever</em> was to be a higher priority than <em>funny</em>.</p>
<p>Answers ranged from short and pithy to a <a href="https://lazybea.rs/tlt/" target="_blank">full article</a>. I loved them all! Even someone who’s never heard of any of these bad boys will get a sense of what they’re best known for.</p>
<p>Here are four:</p>
<p>Markdown, Emacs, and Vim Walked Into a Bar…</p>
<ul>
<li>…But Markdown Ducked Just in Time (this pun’s mine; refers to Markdown escaping the trap of hitting their head on the bar of unnecessary complication)</li>
<li>…Markdown orders a drink and makes friends with everyone while Vim and Emacs spend the night arguing over who gets to edit the menu - @xenodium@indieweb.social</li>
<li>…Two of them started a table, but the other went back to the start of the line - @brettwitty@mstdn.social</li>
<li>…Markdown scanned the menu and ordered a drink; Emacs and Vim spent a month learning a more efficient way to order a drink - @EpiphanicSynchronicity@pkm.social</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re just wetting your toes in techie waters, all this talk of ditching what you know for the wild, wild west might feel a bit much.</p>
<p>As always, please remember that all you really need to start on the path to personal knowledge management (<span class="small-caps">PKM</span>) enlightenment is a simple notebook and / or the generic notes app that came with your computer (likely TextEdit on Mac, and Notepad or WordPad on Windows).</p>
<p>Write something that means something to you, link it somehow (any how) to something else worth reading, repeat. <span class="small-caps">DIY</span> formatting can come later.</p>
<h3 id="over-or-under-rated">Over, or under rated?</h3>
<p>My Mastodon-friend, Hyde (@hyde@lazybear.social) invited me to take part in a series he’s running on whether <strong>Moleskine</strong>, <strong>Obsidian Sync</strong>, <strong>Markdown</strong>, <strong>Vim</strong>, and <strong>Pizza</strong> are overrated or underrated. For most of these items it’s been a solid<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Both”! Hard as it was, I’ve made my choice based on which side of the line the <em>both</em> leans.</p>
<ul>
<li>Moleskine - over (and also under)</li>
<li>Obsidian Sync - under (unless you need it)</li>
<li>Markdown - under<br>
</li>
<li>Vim - over (maybe? I don’t feel qualified to comment, <span class="small-caps">TBH</span>)</li>
<li>Pizza - over (unless it’s healthy)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://lazybea.rs/ovr-022/" target="_blank">You can read the full post on Hyde’s site</a> (along with his take on whether these items are over or underrated), as well as <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025-06-13-moleskine-obsidian-sync-markdown-vim-pizza">here</a>, on my blog.</p>
<h3 id="fun-finale-limerick-time">Fun finale: limerick time</h3>
<p>When Markdown, Emacs, and Vim<br>
were lifting some weights in the gym,<br>
the first two conspired to get poor Vim fired<br>
by hiding the exits from him!</p>
<p>To be clear, <a href="https://ellanew.com">I really don’t care which format you use</a>. I’m more interested in how much a person enjoys the work they do with their chosen tools.</p>
<p>A hybrid approach suits me. Markdown is my daily driver (it’s how I format every post on this site), Org (in Beorg, not Emacs) is how I track my tasks, and Vim is firmly on my list of things to learn. Maybe in No<strong>vim</strong>ber (said in a New Zealand accent)?</p>
