Apple recently added iPad Air models with the M3 chip to its refurbished store <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad/2025-ipad-air-11%E2%80%9D">in the United States</a> and many European countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and others.<br/>

This is the first time the iPad Air with the M3 chip has been available in Apple's refurbished store since the device was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/apple-announces-new-ipad-air-with-m3-chip/">released in March this year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, the refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to new models. In the United States, for example, the 11-inch iPad Air with the M3 chip, 128GB of storage, and Wi-Fi only is available for &#36;509, compared to &#36;599 new.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its refurbished iPads include a new battery and outer shell, a new box, and all accessories, including a 20W USB-C power adapter and/or a USB-C charging cable depending on the country. Apple says it puts refurbished devices through a "thorough cleaning process and inspection," resulting in a like-new condition.<br/>
<br/>
All refurbished iPads are covered by Apple's one-year warranty. AppleCare+ is available.<br/>
