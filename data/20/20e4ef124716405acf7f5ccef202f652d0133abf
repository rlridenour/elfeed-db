God of grace,
</p>

 <p>
You stand and knock, <br></br>
not demanding that we come to you, <br></br>
asking only that we open our hearts <br></br>
that you may come to us.
</p>

 <p>
Help me, likewise, <br></br>
to love others just as <br></br>
you have loved me — <br></br></p>

 <p>
Where they are, <br></br>
and as they are, <br></br>
not how I want <br></br>
them to be.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
