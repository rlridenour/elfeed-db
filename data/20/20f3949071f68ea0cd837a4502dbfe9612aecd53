<p>Australia&#x27;s High Court ruled on 12 November 2025 that federal laws cancelling Russia&#x27;s lease for a Canberra embassy site were valid on national security grounds, rejecting Russia&#x27;s constitutional challenge and allowing the Commonwealth to reclaim the land. The court also held that the Australian constitution requires payment of a reasonable amount of compensation for the acquisition, so Russia is entitled to be paid for the revoked lease. The decision confirms the government&#x27;s 2023 move to revoke the 99-year lease but leaves compensation and some costs to be determined or paid separately.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/WrZ7ob-edGa_FoZhi-buKpxS5Ak_lm6g4NTwz1pMK3zuvz3yONIr64DEhbKJ-vFLntbjB1DUMcmmywOZ6WWTVuviRWMtWNR9pbLP-vz4Qgt5ltlxo2rc60LUtYqA2TZzNQwTtru7jkAAu5S2V_R3OHj9AUxWSGxopONrMYZhyw' alt='Parliament House in Canberra; the nearby plot at issue was slated for a Russian embassy' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Lease origins: The 99-year lease for the Canberra plot was originally granted by the Australian government in 2008, and no embassy developments had been completed on the site before cancellation</li><li>Legal costs: The High Court judgment said the Commonwealth is liable to pay a reasonable amount of compensation and will also need to cover half of Russia’s legal costs from the case, according to reporting</li><li>Russia&#x27;s courtroom argument: Russia told the High Court the laws were unconstitutional because they lacked evidence of any national security threat and therefore should not extinguish property rights without compensation</li><li>On-site protest: After the government&#x27;s cancellation, an official remained on the plot in an apparent bid to frustrate Australian efforts to retake the land, reporting says</li></ul><blockquote>Russophobic hysteria - Russian government statement</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Commonwealth of Australia: The government enacted laws on national security grounds to revoke the lease and reclaim the site near Parliament House.
