<p>The US State Department announced on Thursday that it will classify four European left-wing groups as terrorist organisations, identifying German-based Antifa Ost and three other networks located in Italy and Greece. US reporting says the designations label the groups as violent &#x27;Antifa&#x27; actors; officials presented the moves as part of a broader effort to confront what they called politically motivated violence. Multiple outlets covered the announcement across Europe and Asia, noting it was issued by the State Department this week.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RMP57fEvafrfMnsyOQstYuh7B2d3s6imK3tdsRFEI410yC3t4hb2_jNn2Twu4JJXNUOSigYfH3rE2wim7SX8QXSBFxBQbP81YoAxYjHiIN0OzcASvFw8G47C1Hf0nNyPyL-H4P1PNsR7GSKYmtnxbSix7G4cChw-BO8BMLQ' alt='Image associated with reporting on anti-fascist activism used in coverage of the US designation' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Official label: US statements and reporting use terms such as &#x27;Specially Designated Global Terrorists&#x27; and &#x27;foreign terrorist organisations&#x27; to describe the targets of the move.</li><li>Who announced: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was identified in reporting as the official who announced the designation of German-based Antifa Ost alongside three other groups.</li><li>Geographic note: Reporting from The Hindu says the networks targeted appear to be based in Europe and do not have known operational structures inside the United States.</li><li>Political context: Several outlets place the move within the administration&#x27;s stated effort to confront Antifa and left-wing political violence, linking it to recent statements by the President and senior officials.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio: Marco Rubio said he had designated German-based Antifa Ost as &#x27;Specially Designated Global Terrorists&#x27; and listed three other groups in Greece and Italy in the action.
