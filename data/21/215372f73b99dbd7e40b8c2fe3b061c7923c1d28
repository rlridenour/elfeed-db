<li>Can they make a margarita: Hmmm, what would happen if you soaked a bunch of these in tequila?</li>
</ul><h1>Bouncy</h1><p>Ladies and gentlemen! Announcing, the return… of Pasta Drop!</p>
<p>Only, not really.</p>
<p>And this isn’t actually pasta.</p>
<p>Can I be honest? When I saw “Gummi Fettuccini” on the sales spreadsheet, I imagined those things you sometimes see at the grocery store checkout. You know, where it’s like a build-your-own-mini-burger but all the pieces are gummy candy? I pictured a bowl of pasta along those lines.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong!</p>
<p>Basically, what we have here are some little strands of sweet and sour candy that are, according to the packaging, juicy, fruity, and bouncy. So, two out of three in terms of adjectives you’re happy to see when reading the description of a food.</p>
<p>And you get a box of 10 pouches for just $5. Also, you get to choose your flavor: lemon or grape.</p>
<p>Now, if you ask me, these are basically the two ends of the spectrum when it comes to how artificial the artificial flavor tastes. For my money, citrus fruit flavors are some of the most accurate. It’s the acid, I think. You taste a lemon candy and you’re like, “Ah, neat! Lemonade!”</p>
<p>Artificial grape, meanwhile, challenges banana for the flavor that least resembles how the actual fruit tastes, and that’s embarrassing, because grape doesn’t have the whole ‘extinct variety’ excuse that banana has. (Or, at least, I don’t think so.)</p>
<p>With that being said, Tristan on Amazon ended <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I8HZLRA0C2QM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09K8VBFCR&tag=mehdown-20">his five-star review with an interesting tidbit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are too good. I have no self control and eat the whole box in like two days and them feel the shame of how much sugar I just ate. If you have self control though these are the best. I love the real grape flavor unlike our crappy American artificial flavor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could this be right? Are we just woefully behind on grape flavor here in America?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>Still, a big thanks to Tristan for helping me build some allure. (Although, Tristan, for your own sake, I hope you don’t find this sale.)</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s slightly sour gummy candy. Buy it if you like slightly sour gummy candy.</p>
