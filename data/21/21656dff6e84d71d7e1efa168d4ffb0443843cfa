<blockquote>
  <p>I met with Mr. Lip-Bu Tan, of Intel, along with Secretary of
Commerce, Howard Lutnick, and Secretary of the Treasury, Scott
Bessent. The meeting was a very interesting one. His success and
rise is an amazing story. Mr. Tan and my Cabinet members are going
to spend time together, and bring suggestions to me during the
next week. Thank you for your attention to this matter!</p>
