As soon as this spring, the report said the revamped version of Siri will be able to…<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>Answer more factual/world knowledge questions in a conversational manner</li><br/>
<li>Tell more stories</li><br/>
<li>Provide emotional support</li><br/>
<li>Assist with more tasks, such as booking travel</li><br/>
<li>Create a document in the Notes app with information, such as a cooking recipe</li></ul>The report said Apple plans to announce additional Siri capabilities at WWDC in June, including… <ul><li>Knowledge of past conversations</li><br/>
<li>Proactive suggestions based on information from apps, such as Calendar</li></ul>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">already announced</a> that the personalized Siri would have better understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls, so a lot of the specific capabilities that the report said are coming would align with that.<br/>
<br/>
For example, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.<br/>
<br/>
The report said that the latest prototype of the more personalized Siri does not have any Google or Gemini branding, and Apple will be able to fine-tune Gemini's model to ensure that Siri responds to queries in a way that the iPhone maker prefers.<br/>
