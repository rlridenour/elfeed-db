<p><a href="https://linktr.ee/navigatorsart">Navigators Art</a> are inviting submissions from visual artists based in York for our forthcoming exhibition between 10th March and 6th April 2024.</p>
<p><strong>GUNA</strong> is a version of the ancient Greek word for &lsquo;woman&rsquo; and the show forms part of the city&rsquo;s <strong>International Women&rsquo;s Week</strong> activities.</p>
<p>York Collective Navigators Art &amp; Performance will accept submissions from <strong>visual artists based in York</strong> for our forthcoming exhibition at the <a href="https://www.picturehouses.com/cinema/city-screen-picturehouse">City Screen Picturehouse</a> gallery between 10th March and 6th April 2024.</p>
<p>We will also host a related live performance event of music, spoken word and comedy (independently but under the same title) in The Basement on March 23rd at 7.30 pm.</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;d like to hear from artists (and performers too) whose work identifiably explores, promotes and celebrates the views and voices of women.</strong> The venue requires visual art to be wall-based.</p>
<p>We welcome emerging and established artists equally and encourage new collaborators. Please include a link to your work online and/or examples of your previous work, and a social media link if different.</p>
<p>Submissions must be accompanied by a personal statement about how your work relates to the theme as well as the medium and dimensions of each piece you submit.</p>
<p>We are @navigatorsart on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/navigatorsart/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/navigatorsart/">Instagram</a></p>
