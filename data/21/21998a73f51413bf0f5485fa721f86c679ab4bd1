Over at the Emacs subreddit, iLemming has an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud3Gmxg5UZg">interesting video</a> that explores two packages by <a href="https://github.com/thanhvg">thanhvg</a> for reading reddit and Hacker News from within Emacs. The two packages are <a href="https://github.com/thanhvg/emacs-reddigg">emacs-reddigg</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thanhvg/emacs-hnreader">emacs-hnreader</a>.

Both packages give you a nice Org buffer with each article as a heading and the rest of the content below. Watch iLemming&rsquo;s video to see them in action. It&rsquo;s also pretty easy to customize them as iLemming shows by providing custom search functions. Again, take a look at the video for more details.

I like these two packages but, sadly, they don&rsquo;t fit into my workflow. I never read reddit or Hacker News directly. Rather, I get their content through <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">elfeed</a>, which has a similar user interface and look. Of course, elfeed is RSS based so I often have to follow the link to get all the content. Since I have WebKit hooked into elfeed, my actual workflow just shows we the original Web pages directly as I view each entry.

Of course, lots of people <i>do</i> read reddit and Hacker News directly, and for them these two packages are ideal. You can follow both sites from the comfort of Emacs. If you&rsquo;re one of those people, take a look at iLemming&rsquo;s video and see if they might be right for you.</p>
