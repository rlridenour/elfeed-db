<p>Kagi news looks really good, and I appreciate their principle of updating the news only once a day.</p>
<p>The news section is a &ldquo;stream&rdquo; of titles that expand when you select one into a short blurb (another core principal of theirs is that they need to take five minutes to read, no more) for more information. Each one of those &ldquo;nuggets&rdquo; of information is curated from several sources, which are all listed at the end of the article. I&rsquo;m guessing the text is AI-generated, so some sentences may feel a bit odd, but nothing too bad.</p>
