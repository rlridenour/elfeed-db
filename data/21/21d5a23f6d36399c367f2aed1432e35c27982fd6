The popular DJing app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/djay-dj-app-ai-mixer/id450527929">djay</a> by Algoriddim already offered Apple Music integration since last year, and additional platforms that are now supported include AlphaTheta, Serato, and inMusic's Engine DJ, Denon DJ, Numark, and RANE DJ. For example, you can now access the entire Apple Music catalog in AlphaTheta's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rekordbox-dj-app-dj-mixer/id1487048203">rekordbox</a> app for iPhone and iPad.<br/>
