<p>In 1818, English zoologist William Elford Leach named nine new genera of parasitic isopods: <em>Anilocra</em>, <em>Canolira</em>, <em>Cirolana</em>, <em>Conilera</em>, <em>Lironeca</em>, <em>Nelocira</em>, <em>Nerocila</em>, <em>Olencira</em>, and <em>Rocinela</em>.</p>
<p>Each of these is an anagram of the name <em>Caroline</em> (or its Latinized form <em>Carolina</em>). But Leach was not married and had no known relationship with any woman of that name.</p>
<p>The genera stand as a &#8220;tantalizing puzzle for posterity.&#8221; <a href="https://www.victoriamanning.com/work/elfortiana">More here.</a></p>
