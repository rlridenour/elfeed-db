Many of these tips require the latest version of iOS, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, but there are a few that work for older versions of iOS, too.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li><strong>Alarms in Reminders</strong> - You can set an alarm for a reminder, so you get a pop-up that has to be snoozed or dismissed rather than just a notification.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Adaptive Power Mode</strong> - Adaptive Power Mode is a setting you should turn on, because it uses AI to learn your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; usage habits. If you're using more battery one day, it can adjust background app refresh and other features to preserve battery so you get all-day use. This is limited to newer &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, but you can get some of the same benefit by adjusting which apps are able to use background app refresh on older models.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Link to Specific Text</strong> - When you send a link to someone, you can use Safari's Copy Link with Highlight feature to direct them right to the spot on a webpage that you want them to see.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Action Button Menu</strong> - You can pick one thing for your Action Button to do by default, but if you set it to a Shortcut, you can create a multi-option pop-up that lets you access multiple quick access buttons. It's entirely customizable, and you're only limited to what Shortcuts can do.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Text Message Search</strong> - Search in the Messages app isn't exactly great and it can be hard to find what you're looking for, but there's <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/08e9950b4d674f4f9cd159be9ecdb1ed">a Messages Shortcut</a> that lets you add parameters like date and organize results with the latest messages first.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>AirPods Camera</strong> - You can use the button on your AirPods Pro 2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> as a remote for your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s camera, and when paired with the timer feature, it's a great way to get group shots where everyone is in frame and no one has to hold the phone.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Alarm Snooze</strong> - With &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, you're not limited to a 9-minute snooze duration when an alarm goes off. You can customize your snooze length to be longer or shorter in the Clock app.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Podcast Show Tweaks</strong> - For podcast fans, you can use the Podcasts app to create per-show settings for Enhance Dialogue and playback speed, so you don't need to use the same settings for every podcast.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Snooze Notifications</strong> - For notifications from apps like Calendar and Reminders, you can long press on the notification on the Lock Screen to snooze it for a few minutes, an hour, or a custom length of time.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Screenshots</strong> - Tired of full-screen previews for screenshots? You can turn them off and go back to the prior screenshot method that just saves them right to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app.</li><br/>
