I like GitHub well enough; I link to it often and even have an account but I would never consider using it for anything but public files that I had replicated on my own machine. I&rsquo;ve been over the reasons for that many times. The most important reason is that you should <i>never</i> commit your only copy of any data you care about to a third party computer. Once you do, a clock starts ticking down to the time that you will lose your data. You never know how much time is left on the clock but you can be sure that it will eventually reach 0.<br />
The second reason is that any site that hosts a lot of data is an attractive target for criminals and your data could be compromised. <a href="https://x.com/lbeurerkellner/status/1926991491735429514">Here&rsquo;s the latest GitHub exploit</a>. That&rsquo;s why I say I would only use GitHub for <i>public</i> data.

<p>
All of this is by way of introduction to this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/26/notes/">post from Simon Willison</a>. In it Willison posits that GitHub is (almost) the perfect notebook. What follows is a list of features that could easily be a description of Org mode. Read it and see if you don&rsquo;t agree.

<p>
The only reason for Willison&rsquo;s &ldquo;almost&rdquo; is the lack of synchronized offline support. I submit that <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-for-ios">Journelly</a> goes a long ways towards meeting that concern for Org mode. I&rsquo;ve previously described it as a front end for Org and although it doesn&rsquo;t expose all your Org files to your remote device it gets you a long way.

Given all that, it&rsquo;s clear to me that Emacs and Org mode is a <i>much</i> better notebook than GitHub could hope to be. Your data is safer both from criminals and from being disappeared for some reason by a third party provider. My only question is why do I have to keep repeating this.</p>
