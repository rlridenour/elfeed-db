Sometimes I just need to rewind 15 minutes.
That's the length of A+'s recess at virtual
school, which she does at home. At recess, she
often likes to get hugs and sometimes a snack. If
I'm working on something that requires sustained
thought, like code or a blog post, I can't hold
those thoughts in my head for that long while
cheerfully listening to A+ share the trivia she's
read on the Stardew Valley wiki. If I try to keep
my train of thought, I get grumpy. I'd rather get
better at time travel instead. Naturally, this
calls for Emacs.

<a href="https://sachachua.com/topic/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> is a highly customizable program for
editing text, writing code, and doing mostly
whatever people want to get it to do. <a href="https://sachachua.com/topic/org/">Org Mode</a> is
a package (or ecosystem of packages, really) that
modifies GNU Emacs to make it easier to take
notes, plan tasks, export documents, and so on. If
you're not into Emacs yet, this post might be a
little technical, but maybe there are ways to
translate some of the ideas to things you're
using.

<p>
Sometimes recess totally resets my brain and I
can't even think of what I was just working on. To
make it easier to hit the ground running, I try to
make a habit of creating a task in <a href="https://sachachua.com/topic/org/">Org Mode</a> before
I start working on it. Or, more realistically,
halfway through, when I realize I have to first do
<i>another</i> thing, so then I jot down a quick task
for the work I was previously doing and another
task for the tangent I'm about to go on. That way,
I can quickly check my notes to see what I was
doing. <code>org-capture</code> (which I've bound to <code>C-c r</code>)
is handy for that. I have a template (<code>t</code>) that
creates a timestamped TODO that links to the
context I created it in (files, note headings,
etc.) and saves it to my inbox file. Then I can
jump to my inbox file with a keyboard shortcut and
look at what I need to get back to doing.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I vaguely remember that I've already
created a task for this before and I can find it
with <code>C-u C-c C-w</code> (<code>org-refile</code>). When
<code>org-refile</code> is called with a universal prefix
argument (<code>C-u</code>), it will prompt for a heading in
<code>org-refile-targets</code> and jump to it. I have it set
to complete the outline path, so I can try to find
things by project. Failing that, I might have a
quick rummage in my inbox. I usually don't
remember the exact words I used in the the task
title, though. Maybe someday I'll get the hang of
<a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql">org-ql</a> or <a href="https://github.com/zkry/p-search">p-search</a> (<a href="https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/p-search/">Emacsconf talk on p-search</a>),
resurrect the <a href="https://github.com/zzkt/remembrance-agent">Remembrance Agent</a> so that it can
continuously do bag-of-words matching, or use
embeddings to find semantically similar tasks and
notes. In the meantime, capturing the task is more
important than avoiding duplicates. I can find and
clean up duplicates later on.
</p>

<p>
All of that is moot when I'm away from my
computer, which is most of the time. My phone is
pretty handy for quick notes, though. I use <a href="https://www.orgzlyrevived.com/">Orgzly
Revived</a> to capture a quick note in my inbox. This
gets synchronized with my Org Mode notes using
<a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>.

<p>
Often the interruption doesn't even come from
outside, but from my brain's endless stream of
interesting ideas. Some of those ideas can be
saved as tasks to work on eventually, but
sometimes I need to pause my current task and work
on the new idea. I have a template for an
interrupting task (<code>i</code>) that automatically clocks
out of the previous task and clocks into the new
one.

If I clock into tasks, I can use <code>org-clock-goto</code>
along with the <code>C-u</code> universal prefix (<code>C-u C-c
C-x C-j</code>) to see a list of recently-clocked-in
tasks. This is great for "popping the stack,"
which is how I think of backtracking once I
finished an interrupting task.
</p>

<p>
I usually forget to clock out. That's okay. I'm
not looking for precise total times, just
breadcrumbs.

Sometimes a few keywords aren't enough to jog my
memory. Whenever I think, "Ah, this is easy, I
don't need to take notes," I inevitably regret it.
Sometimes I realize I have to re-do my thinking
fifteen minutes later, when singing 4-Town songs
with A+ has pushed those thoughts out of my brain.
Sometimes I have to re-do my thinking several
months later, which is even harder.
</p>

<p>
Notes are super-helpful. I love the way Org Mode
lets me write notes, paste in hyperlinks, add
snippets of code, save the results of my
explorations, include my sketches, and even export
them as blog posts or documents to share.

<p>
It can take me months or even years before
I can circle back to a project or idea. It can be
hard to reconstruct my thinking after a lot of
time has passed, so it's good to write down as
much as possible. Taking notes feels slower than
just plunging ahead, but they help me travel back
in time to try to remember.
</p>

<p>
This really gets hammered in when I run into
things I've forgotten, like when I dusted off my
<a href="https://github.com/sachac/quantified/commits/master/">time-tracking code</a> so I could make some changes.
In the four years that elapsed between Aug 2020
(my last change) and Oct 2024 (when I decided to
upgrade it to the latest version of Rails), I'd
forgotten how to even run a development version of
my code. Whoops. I ended up taking more notes
along the way.
</p>

<p>
I try to keep project-related notes as close to
the project files as possible, like a README.org
in the project directory. Sometimes I don't even
remember what the project is called. I try to keep
another file that indexes things on my computer as
well as things in real life.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I know I wrote tasks or notes down
before but I can't remember the exact words I used
for them. I'm curious about whether embeddings
might help me find those things again. So far it's
been okay to just add a new task or note, and then
periodically clean up entries that are no longer
needed.

<p>
Sometimes I want to visit
alternate timelines, trying different ways to do
something. I really like the way undo works in
Emacs. It's different from most programs. Emacs
keeps the things you undo/redo.
</p>

<p>
Let's say I start writing a paragraph or a piece
of code. I change my mind about something. Maybe I
undo, maybe I cut, maybe I delete. I write again.
I change my mind again. The first way was better,
maybe. I can go back to that, step through any of
the intermediate changes, consider the other
version again. It's not lost.
</p>

<p>
Actually navigating the Emacs undo history can be
tricky. I like using the <a href="https://github.com/casouri/vundo">vundo</a> package for that.
It shows a compact view of the different branches
of this timeline so that I can easily jump between
them or compare them.
</p>

<div class="update" id="org59f4eeb">
<p>
<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2025-06-26 Thu] </span></span> Check out <a href="https://shom.dev/posts/20250622_undo-finally-clicked-with-vundo/">Undo finally clicked
with vundo | shom.dev</a> for a screenshot and some
explanation of vundo.
</p>

</div>

<p>
If I'm working on something more complicated, like
code, I might make changes over several sessions.
This is where version control is handy. I like
using the <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git version control system</a>, especially
with the <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a> package. I can commit versions of
the files manually along with a quick note about
what I changed or what I'm trying. This allows me
to easily reset to a certain point.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I'm good about picking the right point
to commit: I've made decent progress and things
are working. Sometimes I realize only later on
that I probably should have saved a commit a
little while ago, and now I'm halfway through
another idea that I'm not going to have time to
finish and that leaves my project in a non-working
state. In that situation, sometimes I'll use the
visual undo provided by the vundo package to go
backwards to a version that looks about right,
save that file, commit it with a quick note, and then go forward in
time again.
</p>

<p>
Saving revisions in Git makes it much easier to go
backwards in time even if I've restarted my
computer. <code>magit-blame</code> and <code>vc-annotate</code> give me
slightly different views showing me the changes in
a file. They don't show me information on deleted
sections, though. For that, I can use the
<code>magit-diff</code> command to compare versions.
Sometimes it's easier to flip through the history
of a single file with <a href="https://github.com/emacsmirror/git-timemachine/tree/master">git-timemachine</a>.
</p>

<p>
Git lets me name different experimental timelines
(branches) and logically group changes together.
It means I don't have to worry so much about
messing up a working file, since I can travel back
in time to that version. It also means I can
easily compare them to see what I've changed so
far.
</p>

<p>
In addition to using version control for various
projects, I also save backup files to a separate
directory by setting my <code>backup-directory-alist</code>
to <code>(("." . "~/.config/emacs/backups"))</code>. Disk
space is cheap; might as well keep all the
backups. I sometimes manually go into this
directory to find older versions of things. It
occurs to me that it might be good to flip through
the backups in the same way that git-time-machine
makes it easy to flip through git revisions. I'm
trying out <a href="https://github.com/lewang/backup-walker">lewang/backup-walker</a>, which shows the
incremental diffs between versions. It was last
updated 12 years ago(!), but can easily be dusted
off to work with Emacs 30 by defining some
functions that it's looking for. Here's my config
snippet:
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><code>(<span class="org-keyword">use-package</span> backup-walker

<p>
It's not all about going back to the past.
Sometimes I want to plan ahead: tasks that I want
to schedule for a certain date, pre-mortems to
help me make decisions, gifts for my future self.
I use Google Calendar for appointments and other
things I might want to share with W- for planning,
but there are lots of other things that aren't
tied to a specific time and date. The <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html">agenda
feature</a> of Org Mode is handy for scheduling things
and moving them around.
</p>

<p>
Scheduled tasks don't work out so well if my
agenda gets cluttered by things I ignore, so if I
find myself procrastinating something a lot, I
think about whether I really want to do whatever
it is I've written down.
</p>

<p>
Some notes aren't associated with specific dates,
but with other events that might happen. I have an
Org Mode outline with various subheadings under
"In case of&#x2026;", although I often forget to check
these or have a hard time finding them again.
Maybe someday I can write a script that analyzes
the words I use in my journal entries or tasks and
finds the notes that approximately match those
keywords.

<p>
Thinking out loud more might be worth
experimenting with, since I can do that while I'm
working in a different file. I've used my audio
recorder to <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2023/12/audio-braindump-workflow-tweaks-adding-org-mode-hyperlinks-to-recordings-based-on-keywords/">record braindumps</a> and I have a
workflow for transcribing those with OpenAI
Whisper. I think it would be even more useful to
have an org-capture equivalent so that I can
capture the thought by audio, save the recording
in case there are recognition errors (highly
likely because of the technical terms), and save
the context. Or maybe an even neater interface
that keeps an ear out for keywords, executes
commands based on them, and saves the rest as
notes? <a href="https://github.com/Softcatala/whisper-ctranslate2">whisper-ctranslate2</a> has a <code>live_transcribe</code>
option that works reasonably well after a short
delay, and maybe I can use a process filter to
pull the information out or write a custom Python
script.
</p>

<p>
I appreciate how working with plain text can help
me jump backward or forward in time. I'm looking
forward to seeing how this can be even better!
