<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Personal Value of Conversations Across Serious Disagreement<br />
<em><strong>by Elizabeth Barnes</strong></em></h2>
<p>A little while ago, <a href="https://boldreasoningwithpetersinger.substack.com/p/new-podcast-release-elizabeth-barnes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I was a guest on an episode of</a> Peter Singer and Kasia de Lazari Radek’s lovely podcast, <em><a href="https://www.patreon.com/LivesWellLivedPodcast">Lives Well Lived</a></em>. Because I write on philosophy of disability, and because <a href="https://www.petersinger.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Singer</a> has views about disability that are&#8212;to put it mildly&#8212;controversial, people are often surprised to learn that he and I are on good terms, and that I have tremendous respect for him. That respect persists across significant disagreement&#8212;we talk about some of those disagreements in the episode, as well as lots of points of mutual agreement, and places where we’ve both changed our minds, partly through conversation with each other. In the wake of the podcast episode, Justin asked if I might be interested in writing a guest post reflecting on conversations like these, and on the value of having open conversations about controversial issues and difficult topics. So for whatever it’s worth, this is that post.</p>
<p>More often than not, when we talk about open disagreement and free exchange of ideas, we tend to focus on their broader social value. We say things like: promoting open disagreement is crucial to protecting free speech; promoting open disagreement is the only way to prevent harmful silos and echo chambers; promoting open disagreement is vital to democracy; etc. And I don’t dispute that there are many such values.</p>
<p>But I think an under-discussed aspect of striving to have conversations across serious disagreement is the personal value they can bring. For entirely self-interested and self-regarding reasons, I think these kinds of conversations are good for me. I think they make me a better philosopher and a better thinker.</p>
<p>So I wanted to take this opportunity to reflect on that personal value. In doing this, I realize that my reasons are, well, <em>personal&#8212;</em>this is an exercise in personal reflection rather than argument, and some of what I say here may be entirely dependent on the uniqueness of this particular context and this particular situation, not to mention my own psychology. (Justin is on vacation, sort of, and I am using his blog as my over-sharing diary, you’re welcome.) But I thought it might be worth unpacking why, thinking only of myself and for completely selfish reasons, I’m really glad to have engaged in ongoing discussion with someone whose philosophical perspective is very different from my own, and some of whose views I find offensive. What I’m saying here is descriptive and not prescriptive, and your mileage may vary substantially, depending on the context and the person you’re talking to. But I’m putting it out there in case it’s of interest.</p>
<h3>1. Opponents of a view never give me the best or most charitable version of it</h3>
<p>I disagree&#8212;sometimes profoundly&#8212;with some things that Peter says about disability. But because I want to understand how people think about disability, I want to understand <em>why </em>he says these things. And in news that should be surprising to no one&#8212;but has surprised me way more than I’d like to admit&#8212;I’ve gotten a much better sense of this from talking to him than from talking to his opponents.</p>
<p>His opponents, simply in virtue of being his opponents, will inevitably present his view in a slightly strawman-ish or unfavorable light. Try as we might to uphold the principle of charity, it’s just very hard to make the most compelling case for something we think is false. And I think that’s especially true for things we think are both false and high-stakes.</p>
<p>When I mostly talk with people who share my outlook, it’s probably far easier for me than it should be to lapse into a caricature version of the views of someone like Singer. The line between making good objections and trying to dunk on someone you disagree with is, at least for me, way blurrier and easier for me to ignore than I’d like. And I think this matters even more when it’s a topic that’s of significant moral importance to me, because quite frankly it makes me a worse philosopher. And the last thing I want is to do sloppier philosophy on the topics I care about the most.</p>
<p>It was easier for me than it should’ve been to miss that Peter is a very systematic thinker&#8212;to understand his views on disability, you have to fully understand how he reasons across a wide range of issues, and his critics are simply unlikely to explain that. I don’t agree with his position on infanticide any more than I did when I first encountered it. But I do feel like I can understand it much better than I used to. And trying to understand an argument is step 1 in the process of making a good case for why that argument ultimately doesn’t work.</p>
<h3>2. People who agree with me are never going to push me the way I need to be pushed</h3>
<p>Related to the above, I’ve always tried to think that the single most valuable gift that someone can give me, qua philosopher, is a really great objection. If I’m doing philosophy well, I need to care more about what’s true than about being right. And this is stupidly hard, because the longer I play with an idea the more attached to it I become, and <em>dammit I want to be right.</em> But if I’m messing up, I (should) really want to know. And for that, I need the best objections.</p>
<p>But the truth is that people who are in broad philosophical agreement with me&#8212;while they can and do provide robust criticism&#8212;are just less likely to hit me with the toughest and hardest objections. That’s not from any lack of rigor on their part, it’s just that people who are broadly sympathetic to what I’m saying are less likely to be sympathetic to opposing viewpoints, and so less likely to defend them.</p>
<p>A much harder thing to talk about is a tendency, at least in some areas, to conflate conclusions we politically endorse with conclusions for which we have given good arguments. Sometimes I think&#8212;okay, <em>I know</em>&#8212;that people are reluctant to voice objections to things I’ve said, not because I’ve given a convincing argument, but because I’m a person with a disability making claims about disability, and it just feels <em>uncomfortable </em>to voice hard objections, especially in a public setting.</p>
<p>I get this. I’ve felt the same way in similar contexts. But for my work, it is<em> poison</em>. Without the compliment of forceful objections, I can’t make my work better.</p>
<p>Peter is an interlocutor who has given me a tremendous gift: he will always say what he thinks. No pandering, no soft-balling, just a good old-fashioned objection. I need this more than I’d realized.</p>
<h3>3. Bogeymen only exist in my imagination</h3>
<p>Just as it’s been far too easy for me to lapse into caricature of the views of people I profoundly disagree with, I also think it’s very easy to lapse into caricature when thinking about those people themselves. In some disability-centric circles, the name ‘Peter Singer’ is spoken in hushed tones. The way he’s talked about, you’d think he was something closer to a villain in a children’s fairytale than a mild-mannered academic.</p>
<p>The first time I met Peter, I’m embarrassed to admit that I was upset and nervous. This was <em>Peter Singer</em>. But I quickly figured out that the Peter Singer I was so nervous to meet isn’t real. I had built up an image of him in my imagination, and that image was genuinely unsettling. The real Peter Singer, though, is nothing like that image&#8212;he’s someone who’s always interested in hearing opposing points of view, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/09/29/1039417879/why-peter-singer-the-drowning-child-ethicist-is-giving-away-his-1-million-prize#:~:text=via%20Getty%20Images-,Peter%20Singer,%20the%20Australian%20philosopher%20and%20bioethicist,%20is%20the%20winner,money:%20give%20it%20all%20away." target="_blank" rel="noopener">who wins a million dollars only to immediately give it away</a>, and had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceM8GITkKxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a truly amazing mustache in the 1980s</a>.</p>
<p>The more I’ve read of his work and the more I’ve spoken with him, the more I’ve come to realize that Peter and I agree on much more than we disagree about, even if we arrive at our points of agreement in very different ways. We agree about animal welfare and ethical vegetarianism. We agree about the vital moral importance of health inequalities&#8212;especially global health inequalities. We agree about expanding access to assisted dying. (I very much encourage people to read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/opinion/daniel-kahneman-death-suicide.html">Peter and Kasia’s recent NY Times op ed</a> and then <a href="https://boldreasoningwithpetersinger.substack.com/p/new-podcast-release-daniel-kahneman">listen to their interview with Daniel Kahneman</a>.)</p>
<p>It’s not that I no longer think some of Singer’s views are harmful&#8212;I think they are. And it’s not that I think that vulnerable people who are especially targeted by those harms aren’t justified in being angered by his views&#8212;I think they are fully justified in that anger. But it was an easy slide, at least for me, from a justified appraisal of the harms to a hyperbolic caricature. And that bogeyman, because it really only existed in my mind, only served to hurt me.</p>
<h3>4. People are surprising and I can be a real jerk</h3>
<p>Okay this bit is the most navel-gazing, but bear with me. At the end of the podcast, we talk a little about my experience of being diagnosed (in my 30s) with young-onset Parkinson’s. Something we don’t talk about is that I kept that diagnosis to myself for a while, just to try to get my head around it and get to a place where I felt comfortable talking about it. During the period that I was still keeping it mostly to myself&#8212;where I had only told very close friends and family&#8212;I happened to be corresponding with Peter about something random. And for reasons I can’t fully explain, I mentioned the diagnosis in passing. I mentioned it because, I think, I felt completely comfortable doing so. I knew that he would react exactly the way he did react&#8212;no pity, no condescension, just simple and direct compassion.</p>
<p>I don’t know what it says, exactly, that someone with whom I have such substantial disagreements could also be someone who I can feel completely at ease with on an issue so relevant to our points of disagreement. But I feel like it says <em>something</em>, and I’m glad to have experienced it.</p>
<p>It’s very easy for me to confuse the truth of the propositions a person assents to with the content of that person’s character. It’s very easy for me to assume that if I disagree with someone on an issue that is extremely morally important to me, I’m thereby a better person than they are. It’s very easy for me to be kind of a judgy asshole. I suspect I am not alone in this, among philosophers. I have been truly humbled by many of the ways in which someone I disagree with so starkly can continually fail to be a cartoon villain. I’m really grateful to have been humbled in that way&#8212;it’s been one of the most philosophically enriching experiences of my life.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/07/08/the-personal-value-of-conversations-across-serious-disagreement-guest-post/">The Personal Value of Conversations Across Serious Disagreement (guest post)</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
