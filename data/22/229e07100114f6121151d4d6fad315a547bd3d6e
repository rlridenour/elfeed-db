<p>Apple TV+:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, Apple TV+ announced a new, six-episode seventh season for
the widely hailed, darkly comedic spy drama <em>Slow Horses</em>. The
Emmy and BAFTA Award-winning series stars Academy Award winner Sir
Gary Oldman, who has been honored with Golden Globe, Emmy and
BAFTA Award nominations for his outstanding performance as the
beloved, irascible Jackson Lamb. The complete first four seasons
of <em>Slow Horses</em> are now streaming on Apple TV+, with the premiere
of season five slated for September 24, 2025. Season six was
announced last year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s always good news when a show you love is renewed for another season. It’s almost too good to be true that <em>Slow Horses</em> has been renewed so far into the future already. It’s so good. </p>

<p>Maybe I’m just lucky that the Apple TV shows I like best have proven broadly popular, but it feels like <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/19/amazon-peripheral-season-2">quite the difference</a> from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/02/onion-netflix-wga">other</a> streaming services.</p>
