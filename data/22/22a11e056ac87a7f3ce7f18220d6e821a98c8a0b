<p>President Donald Trump has backed a bipartisan Senate proposal to ramp up pressure on Russia by targeting countries that keep buying Russian energy exports, according to Senator Lindsey Graham. The bill would authorize steep tariffs and other “secondary” measures aimed at trade partners such as India, China and Brazil, with supporters saying the goal is to squeeze revenue that helps fund Russia’s war in Ukraine. Graham said the Senate could vote as soon as mid-January/next week, though the bill has stalled before and the White House has not publicly confirmed details in the reporting cited.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/e_LE-_raxhSZQupjaIxnm3Ui41Xhd1_G2YsfPjysCOZUDTxplpW4SG55tzMFQeVkaIpaCvCATnuv6-3gMfvitwhYNE9ldsHTDw8zm6_6Jm9cEbfxb86d_YFsfhlQTjJZoL3Y6s1NzUzsV8HWRX9MsYsosQWFYqbwbf44EoufVLdoWHDW06154BKDCJb79W7eBO_ZBetyVEkjm1rJ-C2WabkzHv0zuu6WO3OxR5qpOSckzblaI5JqeJY' alt='President Trump pictured during a recent public appearance (image from The Hindu article).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scope of targets: The proposal is framed to cover buyers of Russia’s oil, gas, uranium and other exports, widening beyond crude to additional strategic commodities.</li><li>Ambassador priority: U.S. Ambassador-designate Sergio Gor, expected to take charge in New Delhi on January 12, 2026, has described ending India’s Russian oil imports as a “top priority,” according to The Hindu.</li><li>Flexibility request: Politico reports President Trump has previously asked for “absolute flexibility” to impose or retract sanctions, a key issue as lawmakers finalize the bill’s design.</li><li>US uranium question: Firstpost highlights a potential complication for Washington: the U.S. also buys Russian uranium, raising questions about how broadly such tariff tools could be applied without hitting U.S. supply needs.</li><li>Earlier tariff step: RT says President Trump has already imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods linked to New Delhi’s trade with Moscow, preceding the new, much larger tariff authority discussed in the bill.</li></ul><blockquote>After a very productive meeting today with President Trump on a variety of issues, he greenlit the bipartisan Russia sanctions bill that I have been working on for months with Senator Blumenthal and many others, - Senator Lindsey Graham</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Sen.
