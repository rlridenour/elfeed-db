<p>A fresh round of diplomatic tension has emerged after President Trump again raised the idea of the United States “purchasing” Greenland, comments he made around the World Economic Forum in Davos. Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has continued to resist the idea, a stance that has made her a central figure in managing the relationship between Washington, Copenhagen and Greenland’s own political sensitivities. The episode underscores how Greenland’s strategic location and resources are pulling it further into great-power politics, even as Denmark and Greenland seek to keep decision-making grounded in sovereignty and existing constitutional arrangements.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DbMuIRQX-UT4YcdXYUg4Sgo0nMuZkjVZkiRuyRHpgmfnIlmwTBocOIRjauzLlO0hDX02CfI6g-xdRYpvcxnOmkYoBZebHxEI5wThGs4ylDyHPBODaAI6cM-fFUZCNJzJzecShqWY7yHK7_8xior9EVRQ6xyp3R0wt0TFj6v5OOvTilddYvrA9aVSE1uOdUFm-6VX_Z5Zj5YmAA' alt='Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, in her office in Copenhagen.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Denmark’s posture: The New York Times depicts Frederiksen as taking significant political risks to stand up to President Trump on Greenland, betting that a firm but pragmatic approach can reduce pressure—at least for now.</li><li>Davos framing: The Hindu’s editorial argues that talk of “purchasing” Greenland echoes neo-colonial patterns and intensifies concerns about control of resources and geopolitics in the Arctic.</li><li>Military precautions: WSWS, citing Danish public broadcaster DR, reports Denmark equipped troops deployed to Greenland earlier this month with live ammunition and orders to engage in combat if attacked, describing it as a response to perceived U.S. threats.</li><li>Frederiksen profile: NDTV highlights Frederiksen’s repeated refusal to entertain the idea of Greenland being acquired, presenting her as the main political obstacle to Trump’s renewed interest.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. President Donald Trump: Trump suggested the United States could “purchase” Greenland in remarks connected to the World Economic Forum in Davos.
