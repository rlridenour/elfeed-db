Below, we have recapped 10 other Apple products that are expected to launch this year, with some likely to debut at the event and others to follow later.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 3:</strong> A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-watch-ultra-3-display-size/">slightly larger display</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-watch-s11-chip-info/">S11 chip</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/02/apple-watch-ultra-3-on-track-for-this-year/">5G support</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/02/apple-watch-ultra-3-on-track-for-this-year/">satellite connectivity</a> for sending and receiving text messages in supported areas without Wi-Fi and cellular coverage. Other likely upgrades include faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that is brighter at an angle.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Apple Watch Series 11:</strong> Expect a spec-bump year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-watch-s11-chip-info/">with an S11 chip</a> and smaller changes, after the Apple Watch Series 10 featured bigger changes last year. iOS 26 beta code allegedly includes references to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/22/sleep-score-apple-watch-ios-26/">unreleased "Sleep Score" feature</a> that could be exclusive to the next Apple Watch models.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Apple Watch SE 3:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/29/apple-watch-se-3-could-get-new-display-sizes/">Larger display sizes</a> and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-watch-s11-chip-info/">S11 chip</a> have been rumored for this model. The device was rumored to feature a plastic case in bright color options, but that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/23/plastic-apple-watch-se-in-jeopardy/">might not be happening anymore</a>. Given the Apple Watch SE has not been updated since 2022, it has many features to catch up on.</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPad Pro</strong>: The next iPad Pro is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">powered by Apple's next-generation M5 chip</a>. In addition, the device will reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">be equipped with two front cameras</a>, for both portrait and landscape orientation usage.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Vision Pro:</strong> A minor refresh is expected for the Vision Pro, with rumored upgrades <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/apple-vision-pro-2025-features/">including an M4 chip</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-code-confirms-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">or an M5 chip</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/apple-vision-pro-2025-features/">a new head strap</a> that makes it easier to wear the headset for extended periods.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple TV 4K (4th generation):</strong> Rumored features include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/">an A17 Pro chip</a> for faster performance, and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a> with Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7 support. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">built-in FaceTime camera</a> has been rumored for a future Apple TV, but it is unclear if that will arrive with the next model.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>HomePod mini (2nd generation):</strong> Rumored features include an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/homepod-mini-new-chip/">S9 chip or newer</a>, and an Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip with Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7 support. Improved sound quality is also a safe bet.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>AirTag (2nd generation):</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/airtag-2-longer-range-rumor/">Up to 3× longer item tracking range</a> vs. current AirTag, a more tamper-proof speaker, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/25/airtag-2-september-or-later-rumor/">"very low" battery life alerts</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>AirPods Pro 3:</strong> Updated design, increased noise cancellation, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/airpods-pro-3-expected-this-year/">heart rate monitoring</a>.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Studio Display 2:</strong> A new version of the Studio Display with mini-LED backlighting is expected to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/studio-display-2-rumor-recap/">in late 2025 or early 2026</a>.</li></ul><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2025-apple-event/">September 2025 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/03/beyond-iphone-17/">Beyond iPhone 17: Apple Rumored to Launch 10 Other Products in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beyond-iphone-17-apple-rumored-to-launch-10-other-products-in-2025.2464541/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
