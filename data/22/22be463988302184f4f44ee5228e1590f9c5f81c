<h3>Apple Launches Second Limited-Edition iPhone Accessory in a Month</h3><br/>
Fresh on the heels of the iPhone Pocket that has now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/25/iphone-pocket-fully-sold-out/">sold out worldwide</a>, Apple has released a second limited-edition accessory with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/21/apple-launches-hikawa-iphone-grip-stand/">Hikawa Phone Grip and Stand</a>.<br/>

The new grip and stand, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/hikawa-iphone-grip-sold-out-preorders-available/">also quickly sold out through Apple</a>, is an accessibility-minded accessory that attaches to an iPhone via MagSafe. It was designed by LA-based Bailey Hikawa with direct input from individuals with disabilities affecting muscle strength, dexterity, and hand control.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Foldable iPhone to Debut These Three Breakthrough Features</h3><br/>
We're continuing to hear rumors about the so-called "iPhone Fold," which is now expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/25/foldable-iphone-two-breakthrough-features/">include three standout features</a> that could set it apart from the competition.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/Apple-Foldable-Thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015809" /><br/>
Key rumored features include an industry-first 24-megapixel under-display camera built into the inner display, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/iphone-fold-2026-engineering-validation/">crease-free design for the inner display</a>, and a battery consisting of high-density cells that should give it the highest-capacity battery of any iPhone and top that of key competitors like Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold7 and Google's Pixel Fold.<br/>
<br/>
All of this certainly won't come cheap, however, with one recent report predicting that prices will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/foldable-iphone-could-cost-2400/">in the &#36;2,400 range</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>iOS 27 Will Reportedly Have Two Key Upgrades</h3><br/>
iOS 27 will reportedly have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/23/ios-27-two-key-upgrades/">two major elements: quality improvements and new AI features</a>.<br/>
<br/>

In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter this week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that iOS 27 will be similar to Mac OS X Snow Leopard, in the sense that Apple is focused on improving "quality and underlying performance" over adding new features.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said there is one exception to this rule, though, as he expects there to be new AI features. He said that iOS 27 will extend artificial intelligence to additional Apple apps, and he reiterated that there will be an Apple Health+ subscription service that offers personalized health recommendations and more.<br/>
