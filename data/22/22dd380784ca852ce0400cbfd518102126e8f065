Apple is expected to release iOS 18.4 to the general public as soon as next week, following more than a month of beta testing.<br/>

Apple's website says some iOS 18.4 features will be released in "early April," so the update should be out as early as Tuesday, April 1.<br/>
<br/>
Apple this week seeded the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/apple-releases-ios-18-4-rc/">iOS 18.4 Release Candidate</a>, which is typically the final beta version, barring the discovery of any major last-minute software bugs. iOS updates are typically released one week after the Release Candidate, and next week will be early April, so that would align with the timeframe that Apple has provided.<br/>
<br/>
There is always a possibility of a Release Candidate 2, however, which could push back the release schedule by up to one more week.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.4 is compatible with the iPhone XS series and newer, and it will be available in the Settings app under General → Software Update once it is released.<br/>
