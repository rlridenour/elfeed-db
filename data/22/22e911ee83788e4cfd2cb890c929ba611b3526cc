In a new post on Weibo, the user known as "Instant Digital" said that Chinese supplier BOE has little hope of making panels for the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; because Apple's brightness requirements for the next-generation device are unprecedentedly high. This suggests that the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj;'s display will see a considerable leap forward in terms of brightness.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 13 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 offered a typical maximum brightness of 800 nits, with peak HDR brightness of 1,200 nits. With the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> Apple increased this to 1,000 nits typical maximum brightness and 1,600 nits peak HDR brightness. The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; also saw a notable increase from 2,000 nits of outdoor peak brightness to 3,000 nits. <br/>

Earlier today, Korea's <em>The Elec</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/apple-shifts-iphone-oled-orders-samsung/">reported</a> that BOE is again struggling with &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; OLED production, causing millions of panel orders to be shifted to Samsung Display.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; is expected to launch in early 2027, featuring the A20 chip, the C2 modem, and a simpler Camera Control.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/boe/">BOE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/iphone-18-rumored-to-feature-much-brighter-display/">iPhone 18 Rumored to Feature Much Brighter Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-rumored-to-feature-much-brighter-display.2476391/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
