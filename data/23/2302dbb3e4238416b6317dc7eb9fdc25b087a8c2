<p>In the latest development in Gaza ceasefire talks, Israel says it will reopen the Rafah crossing with Egypt only after its military completes an operation to recover the remains of the last Israeli hostage believed held in Gaza, identified in reports as soldier Ran Gvili. Israeli officials describe the planned opening as “limited,” allowing pedestrian movement rather than full cross-border operations. The U.S. has been pressing Israel and Hamas to move into a next phase of the ceasefire framework, which several outlets say was announced by President Donald Trump in October and includes reopening Rafah as a key step.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ZjnJzvm7DuCTQDgXDsypwqWe4idAn_mhnmtwb6Qmuuiu6GjjRvcq0IXo56jW6XyeDWndWi5TxRJpy5mBiFTHnr9e3klVhO7fZKGEqU6ofSizVWhw1Zxbk09vxXl34BxbYiqGVpGOQDdRCEyMN13heyAsosgZZW5bfcRcYlxeAONGOb-Uoji1aPfrGQRUFRYVDq0pZjJDfJfXjzEXO36u759AgTL87LvErNGupNVTxtdFyYvYuLJvYdsK7Ysods66-IUbig4Fuuyx0psR6Q' alt='People hold signs with a photo of Ran Gvili at a Tel Aviv rally calling for his return, Jan. 23, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Search operation: Israel’s military said it launched a “large-scale” (or “targeted”) operation in northern Gaza and has been searching at a Gaza cemetery for the captive’s remains, as Cabinet-level discussions continued on Rafah’s status.</li><li>Mediator pressure: Reports say top U.S. envoys met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and urged progress on next steps, including reopening Rafah, as Washington and other mediators push both sides toward a subsequent phase of the truce.</li><li>Hamas communication: Al Jazeera reported Hamas said it provided mediators with details about the remains of the last Gaza captive, a claim aired as negotiations over Rafah and the ceasefire phase advanced.</li><li>Crossing modalities: Israeli statements described the reopening as limited to pedestrian traffic; RT reported U.S. officials want the crossing to operate in both directions as originally agreed, while Israel has sought conditions including Hamas disarmament and restrictions tied to security concerns.</li><li>Border control: Rafah has remained shut since Israeli forces took control of the crossing during the war, according to Al-Monitor’s account of the timeline and the truce framework.</li></ul><blockquote>Positive - Steve Witkoff</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli government: Israel says it will reopen Rafah only after completing the operation to recover the last hostage’s remains, and it frames the reopening as limited and focused on pedestrian passage.
