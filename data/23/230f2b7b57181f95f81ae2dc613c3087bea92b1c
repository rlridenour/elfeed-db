 <b>For the First Sunday of Advent</b>
</p>

 <p>
God of all hope,
</p>

 <p>
When those seeking food and shelter <br></br>
are told only to pray to Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
When those fleeing the devastation of war <br></br>
are told only to go to Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
And when those who <br></br>
have lost all hope <br></br>
are told only to hope in Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
Then, Lord, I have failed.
</p>

 <p>
For if I will not welcome <br></br>
those whom the world now rejects, <br></br>
then why would I welcome the child <br></br>
whom the world did reject?
</p>

 <p>
So, instead of the usual <br></br>
empty platitudes of the season, <br></br>
may I offer real hope, <br></br>
a hope that feeds, <br></br>
clothes, and shelters, <br></br>
heals broken lives, <br></br>
and mends broken spirits.
</p>

 <p>
In the name of Christ,
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
