<p>DeadSwitch works on a new blade &#8211; an Emacs-powered static site generator.<br>No analytics. No ads. No noise. Just signal.</p>

<p>Are you an Emacs user?<br>Do you use Org Mode?</p>



<p>The Whisper Engine may be your weapon.</p>



<p>This is not for influencers.<br>This is for insurgents.<br>Those who still believe in owning their words.<br>Ghosts who refuse to rent space in someone else&#8217;s cloud.</p>



<p>If you can wield Emacs like a blade, this engine sharpens the edge.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org98b13bf">Features Of The Blade</h3>



<p><strong>The Whisper Engine is an Emacs-powered static site generator.</strong></p>



<p>It&#8217;s under constant development.<br>The focus is&nbsp;<strong>simplicity</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>security</strong>.<br>The code is modular. Logical. Extensible.</p>

<p>Org files feed the system.<br>Metadata rules the process.<br>HTML builds the castle.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>The feature set is simple, yet effective:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cleanup before site generation (no forgotten files)</li>



<li>Paginated index page (configurable amount of titles)</li>



<li>Clean directory structure (<em>public-html/<strong>year</strong>/<strong>month</strong>/slug.html</em>)</li>



<li>Protected directories in the public site root. (For CSS, fonts, images)</li>



<li>No JS</li>



<li>No analytics. No scripts. No noise. Just raw signal, encrypted in silence.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Whisper Engine is a tool for Ghosts to express themselves in simplicity.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="orgcfef19f">Known Limitations of the Whisper</h3>



<p>Silence has its price. Minimalism cuts both ways.<br>The Whisper Engine is&nbsp;<strong>simple</strong>, self-contained, dedicated to Emacs users.</p>



<p>A full workflow achievable from an Emacs frame.</p>



<p>Yet, there are some warnings ahead:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Full purge</strong>&nbsp;before deploy. No ghosts left behind.</li>



<li>Header and footer elements are embedded&nbsp;<strong>into the lisp code</strong>&nbsp;(<em>plans</em>&nbsp;for external DOM templates)</li>



<li>&#8216;id&#8217; attributes are stripped away&nbsp;<strong>entirely</strong>&nbsp;from the HTML (temporary fix for another problem)</li>



<li>No RSS (yet)</li>



<li>No site map (yet)</li>



<li>No themes (only CSS)</li>



<li>Custom static pages are hardcoded (for now)</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite these, the Whisper Engine is&nbsp;<strong>functional</strong>. Solid. Extensible.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org49d792a">The Ghost&#8217;s Whisper</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Whisper Engine is not for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It started growing as an internal documentation tool for the Silent Architect.<br>The Engine doesn&#8217;t intend to compete with other static site generators. They serve their purpose. This one serves Ghosts.</p>



<p>The Whisper Engine is a weapon to use an entire Emacs-based workflow.<br>From drafting to authoring. The full pipeline.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>The Whisper Engine is for Ghost Operators.<br>From the Silent Architect.</p>

<p>First release drops soon. If you listen closely, you&#8217;ll hear the Whisper.</p>
