<p>CNN media analyst Brian Stelter, on Bluesky:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As “60 Minutes” finalized its “Inside CECOT” report last Thursday,
CBS sent the White House a request for comment. A WH spokesperson
responded within a few hours. The quote was not included in the
“60” report — so, judge for yourself whether it should have been
included or not.</p>

<p>WH spokesperson Abigail Jackson said “60 Minutes should spend
their time and energy amplifying the stories of Angel Parents,
whose innocent American children have tragically been murdered by
vicious illegal aliens that President Trump are removing from the
country.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the fact that it doesn’t address a single aspect of the report, 60 Minutes should have included that statement, both to reveal the belligerent callousness of the administration, and to highlight the glaring grammatical error. In its way, the statement speaks volumes.</p>
