<li>Big towels made of microfiber</li>
<li>They dry very fast</li>
<li>Great for camping and also not camping</li>
<li>Is it Mac-compatible: If your Mac goes swimming, you’re probably going to need more than these</li>
</ul><h1>T'Owl</h1><p>On Amazon (where, we should add, these earn an average score of 4.8 out of 5, based on almost 7500 ratings), the top review, by user RS, perfectly summarizes why these things are great:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I honestly wasn’t expecting to love a towel this much but Wise Owl totally nailed it. The quality is way better than your average travel towel. Super soft, dries insanely fast and the carrying case is actually handy. No more damp, smelly towels in my backpack. I used it for camping, the gym, AND a beach trip and it handled all three perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we want to focus on that part in the middle there. “No more damp, smelly towels in my backpack.”</p>
<p>You see something advertised as being built to dry quickly, and you think, <em>Oh, cool! So I can jump in the pool, get out, dry off, then jump in again in a little while, and my towel will be ready for me!</em></p>
<p>And that’s true.</p>
<p>But the true joy of a quick-dry towel is what RS discusses. You can toss it in your trunk or throw it in the laundry room, and if you forget it there, it’s okay.</p>
<p>Are we encouraging slovenly behavior? No, of course not. You should hang up your wet towels, you disgusting cave person! But, sometimes, shit hits the fan, and you have to do what you have to do.</p>
<p>Like, maybe you’re out playing outside with your kid and/or dog, and a storm rolls in faster than you can take shelter, soaking everyone. Your job, as soon as you get home, is to get everyone dry and comfortable.</p>
<p>And if, after you towel everyone off and get everyone in dry clothes and situated in front of the television with a hot beverage, the towel ends up tossed aside, it’s only natural.</p>
<p>Also, did we mention these things are really big?</p>
<p>That seems like an important thing to include.</p>
<p>Anyway, get some big camping towels. You’ll use them for something, right?</p>
