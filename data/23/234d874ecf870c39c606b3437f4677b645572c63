I have added the following shortcut, possible since exwm frees up my s- key:
(exwm-input-set-key (kbd &#34;s-&lt;backspace&gt;&#34;) &#39;kill-this-buffer) And, for when I am already in an emacs buffer, this added to my personal key map:
(define-key map (kbd &#34;s-&lt;backspace&gt;&#34;) &#39;kill-this-buffer) In any case, making a single-chord shortcut for kill-this-buffer has highlighted how often I use the command, and made work that much faster. Highly recommended!
