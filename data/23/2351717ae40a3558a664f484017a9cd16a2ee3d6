<p>New (well, newish) Mac app from John Siracusa:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyperspace-reclaim-disk-space/id6739505345?mt=12">Hyperspace</a> searches for files with identical contents within
one or more folders. If it finds any, it can then reclaim the disk
space taken by all but one of the identical files — <em>without
removing any of the files!</em></p>

<p>You can <a href="https://hypercritical.co/hyperspace/#how-it-works">learn more</a> about how this is done, if you’re
interested, but the short version is that Hyperspace uses a
standard feature of the macOS file system: space-saving clones.
The Finder does the same thing when you duplicate a file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love everything about this app. I love the name — it “works” in like at least three ways. I love that it’s right up Siracusa’s alley. I love that Siracusa has talked about it, at wonderful length, on ATP and <a href="https://hypercritical.co/2025/02/25/hyperspace">expounded upon it on his blog</a>. I love that the premise sounds a little crazy but the explanation makes all the sense in the world. I love that this small, laser-focused utility is fully and splendidly documented. I love the way it looks. It’s got a great icon. I mean <em>of course</em> it would, but still, let’s celebrate how fun this is.</p>
