<p id="p2">Today, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-vision-pro-upgraded-with-the-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple announced the first revision to the Vision Pro</a>, the company&rsquo;s mixed reality headset. The updated device sports an M5 chip and the new Dual Knit Band for improved comfort.</p>
<p id="p3">The M5 chip is making its debut in the Vision Pro alongside the new <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-debuts-new-14-macbook-pro-with-the-m5-chip/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-new-m5-ipad-pros/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPad Pro</a>. It features a 10-core CPU, a 16-core Neural Engine that&rsquo;s up to 50% faster than the M2, and a 10-core GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading. The M5 allows the Vision Pro to render 10 percent more pixels on its micro-OLED displays, resulting in a clearer image, an increased refresh rate up to 120Hz, and a smoother Mac Virtual Display experience. It also increases the device&rsquo;s battery life to 2.5 hours of regular use and 3 hours of video playback. The M5 processor works alongside the R1 co-processor and the device&rsquo;s built-in cameras and sensors to render the user&rsquo;s surroundings in real time.</p>

<p id="p5">The biggest visible difference this generation is the new Dual Knit Band. Made of two 3D-knitted straps that look similar to the original Solo Knit Band, the Dual Knit Band incorporates a second strap that runs across the top of the user&rsquo;s head and a counterweight in the lower strap to better distribute weight, increase comfort, and create a more stable fit. The strap is backwards compatible with the first-generation Vision Pro and available to purchase for $99.</p>
<p id="p6">Owners of either the M2 or M5 Vision Pro can pair the device with spatial accessories. The Sony PlayStation VR2 Sense Controller, which enables VR games like Elu Legend, Pickle Pro, Ping Pong Club, and Spatial Rifts and can be used to navigate visionOS in lieu of hand tracking, will cost $249.95 and be available November 11. The <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HS9U2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logitech Muse</a> digital pencil for drawing and collaboration costs $129.95; it can be pre-ordered directly from Apple now and will be released alongside the M5 Vision Pro.</p>
<p id="p7">The Vision Pro itself, meanwhile, maintains its starting price of $3,499 with 256&nbsp;GB of built-in storage. The storage can optionally be configured to 512&nbsp;GB for $3,699 or 1&nbsp;TB for $3,899. The M5 Vision Pro is available for pre-order now with deliveries and in-store availability starting Wednesday, October 22.</p>
