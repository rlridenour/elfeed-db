<p id="p2">It&rsquo;s been a couple of months since I updated my desk setup. In that time, I&rsquo;ve concentrated on two areas: video recording and handheld gaming.</p>
<p id="p3">I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the Elgato Facecam Pro 4K camera, so I switched to <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-e-is-for-elemental/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the iPhone 16e</a>. The Facecam Pro is a great webcam, but the footage it shot for our podcasts was mediocre. In the few weeks that I&rsquo;ve moved to the 16e, I&rsquo;ve been very happy with it. My office is well lit, and the video I&rsquo;ve shot with the 16e is clear, detailed, and vibrant.</p>
<p id="p4">The <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16e/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 16e</a> sits behind an <a href="https://amzn.to/4j4lRlF" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elgato Prompter</a>, a desktop teleprompter that can act as a second Mac display. That display can be used to read scripts, which I haven&rsquo;t done much of yet, or for apps. I typically put my Zoom window on the Prompter&rsquo;s display, so when I look at my co-hosts on Zoom, I am also looking into the camera.</p>

<p id="p6">The final piece of my video setup that I added since the beginning of the year is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3FS4M00" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tourbox Elite Plus</a>. It&rsquo;s a funny looking contraption with lots of buttons and dials that fits comfortably in your hand. It&rsquo;s a lot like <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/getting-started-with-shortcuts-for-mac-and-the-stream-deck/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Stream Deck</a> or <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/first-look-logitechs-mx-creative-console-is-poised-to-compete-with-elgatos-stream-deck-lineup/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logitech MX Creative Console</a>, but the many shapes and sizes of its buttons, dials, and knobs set it apart and make it easier to associate each with a certain action. Like similar devices, everything can be tied to keyboard shortcuts, macros, and automations, making it an excellent companion for audio and video editing.</p>
<p id="p7">On the gaming side of things, my biggest investment has been in a <a href="https://amzn.to/4iKr02M" rel="noopener noreferrer">TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 Mesh System</a>. Living in a three-story condo makes setting up good Wi-Fi coverage hard. With my previous system I decided to skip putting a router on the third floor, which was fine unless I wanted to play games in bed in the evening. With a new three-router system that supports Wi-Fi 7 I have better coverage and speed, which has already made game streaming noticeably better.</p>

<p id="p9">The other changes are the addition of the <a href="https://www.ayntec.com/products/odin2-portal?variant=46016396165312" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ayn Odin 2 Portal Pro</a>, which we&rsquo;ve covered on <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPC: Next Portable Console</a>. I love its OLED screen and the fact that it runs Android, which makes streaming games and setting up emulators a breeze. It supports Wi-Fi 7, too, so it pairs nicely with my new Wi-Fi setup.</p>
<p id="p10">A few weeks ago, I realized that I often sit on my couch with a pillow in my lap to prop up my laptop or iPad Pro. That convinced me to add <a href="https://amzn.to/3DU4FR2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mechanism&rsquo;s Gaming Pillow</a> to my setup, which I use in the evening from my couch or later in bed. Mechanism makes a bunch of brackets and other accessories to connect various devices to the pillow&rsquo;s arm, which I plan to explore more in the coming weeks.</p>

<p id="p12">There are a handful of other changes that I&rsquo;ve made to my setup that you can find along with everything else I&rsquo;m currently using on our Setups page, but there are two other items I wanted to shout out here. The first is the <a href="https://amzn.to/43PF06u" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSAUX 16&rdquo; FlipGo Pro Dual Monitor</a>, which <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/getting-away-from-your-desk-with-jsauxs-flipgo-pro-dual-display/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I recently reviewed</a>. It&rsquo;s two 16&rdquo; stacked matte screens joined by a hinge. It&rsquo;s a wonderfully weird and incredibly useful way to get a lot of screen real estate in a relatively small package. The second item is <a href="https://amzn.to/43V38on" rel="noopener noreferrer">8BitDo&rsquo;s new Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller</a> that works with Windows and Android. I was a fan of the original version of this controller, but this update preserves the original&rsquo;s build quality and adds new features like L4 and R4 buttons, TMR joysticks that use less energy than Hall Effect joysticks, and 2.4G via a USB-C dongle and Bluetooth connection options.</p>
<p id="p13">That&rsquo;s it for now. In the coming months, I hope to redo parts of my smart home setup, so stay tuned for another update later this summer or in the fall.</p>
