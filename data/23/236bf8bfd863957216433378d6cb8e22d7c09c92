<li>Human-grade tuna and chicken… but for cats</li>
<li>Best-by dates range from September 2025 to March 2026</li>
<li>Add it to their dry kibble or just give it to them as a snack</li>
<li>Is it available in Georgia Red: dear god, no!</li>
</ul><h1>Feline Hungry</h1><p>Behold: four comments from a previous Inaba sale that, together, perfectly sum up the enigma of cats.</p>
<p>From <a href="/@xtrunksiex">@xtrunksiex</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m late to the party, but I refer to Inaba Churu as “crack.” I give it to dogs and cats and they go absolutely crazy. My friends’ animals won’t leave me alone when I visit because they know I have Crack on me. Haven’t tried this style but I had to get some. These things are worth their weight in gold!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from <a href="/@steelopus">@steelopus</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Popping in to say the chicken in chicken broth are an enormous hit with my three floofs and I now regret not buying multiple boxes when this deal was live. It’s literally a piece of cooked chicken breast and it looks delicious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from <a href="/@joe645">@joe645</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry my stupid cat won’t eat tuna</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from <a href="/@pmarin">@pmarin</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My cat only liked one kind of tuna cat food (was called tuna for cats at Trader Joe’s), it is discontinued though. They had another one but he didn’t like it. I found if I cooked a real tuna steak from the grocery store, or salmon, he would like those. I made sure to make a portion with no seasoning for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, to recap: some cats love this stuff. Like, they’re ADDICTED to it. Other cats, meanwhile, don’t like ANY tuna (which is insane to me). And other cats still have BRAND PREFERENCES for which tuna they prefer; otherwise, they make you COOK IT FOR THEM!</p>
<p>And this, friends, is why you should only buy your cat snacks from us. Because we sell the fancy stuff at trashy prices. Thus, you can treat your little furry friends to “the best” without getting annoyed when they turn their noses up to it and demand some gelatinous quasi-meat product out of a can.</p>
<p>Also, to be clear, humans can eat this stuff too. But no one seems to have tried. C’mon people, eat some cat food and leave a review in the comments!</p>
<p>Or else, just buy some for your cats.</p>
<p>Actually, yeah, on second thought, do that.</p>
