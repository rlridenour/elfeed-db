<blockquote><p>
[Jerome Sankey] challenged Sir William [Petty] to fight with him. Sir William is extremely short-sighted, and being the challengee it belonged to him to nominate place and weapon. He nominates for the place a dark cellar, and the weapon to be a great carpenter&#8217;s axe. This turned the knight&#8217;s challenge into ridicule, and so it came to nought.
