The film reached &#36;509 million in ticket sales as of the final weekend in July, according to Comscore data reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/27/superman-f1-both-cross-500-million-at-the-global-box-office.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. F1 eclipses the previous record held by "Napoleon," Ridley Scott's 2023 historical epic, which grossed &#36;221 million worldwide.<br/>
<br/>
The film also significantly outperformed other Apple theatrical projects including "Killers of the Flower Moon" (&#36;158 million), "Argylle" (&#36;96 million), and "Fly Me to the Moon" (&#36;42 million). F1's box office performance positions Apple to recoup its full investment through theatrical receipts alone. <br/>
<br/>
The film crossed the &#36;400 million threshold in mid-July. F1 was released in over 80 countries and reportedly maintained strong attendance during weekday screenings. With &#36;509 million in earnings, F1 surpasses "Superman" at &#36;502 million to become one of the most popular films of the summer. <br/>

After its theatrical run, F1: The Movie is expected to come to &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ later this year. Apple is also believed to have put in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/14/apple-expected-to-win-rights-to-f1/">winning bid</a> to stream Formula 1 itself.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/f1-surpasses-500-million/">Apple&#039;s &#039;F1: The Movie&#039; Surpasses &#36;500 Million Box Office Earnings</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-f1-the-movie-surpasses-500-million-box-office-earnings.2462337/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
