<p id="p2"><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giovanni Colantonio of Digital Trends</a> broke the story today that Apple has acquired <a href="https://www.rac7.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">RAC7</a>, the two-person game studio responsible for the hit Apple Arcade game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sneaky-sasquatch/id1465346522?mt=12" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sneaky Sasquatch</a>.</p>
<p id="p3">On the one hand, this news isn&rsquo;t that surprising. Sneaky Sasquatch was a launch title for Apple Arcade when it debuted in 2019, and it has been highlighted in several keynotes in the years since. <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As Colantonio notes in his story</a>, Apple Arcade Senior Director Alex Rofman specifically called out Sneaky Sasquatch as an Apple Arcade success in a 2024 interview with Digital Trends.</p>
<p id="p4">On the other hand, however, this is Apple&rsquo;s first known game studio acquisition and a very small indie studio acquisition at that. Out of context, that seemed like an odd acquisition. However, not long after Digital Trends broke the acquisition news, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-27/apple-to-debut-dedicated-gaming-app-within-days-of-switch-2-s-arrival?embedded-checkout=true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gurman reported for Bloomberg</a> that Apple will unveil a dedicated Games app, which lines up with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/27/ios-19-gaming-app/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a previous report by 9to5Mac</a>. Not much is known about the rumored app at this point, but it certainly puts the RAC7 acquisition in a different light. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we hear news of other indie studios joining Apple in the coming months.</p>
