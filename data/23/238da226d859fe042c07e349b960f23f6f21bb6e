It turns out that Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/15/iphone-17-adaptive-power/">Adaptive Power mode</a> extends beyond the iPhone.<br/>

Starting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/15/apple-releases-watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a>, Adaptive Power is enabled by default on all compatible Apple Watch models set up via <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-for-your-kids/">Apple Watch For Your Kids</a>, formerly known as Family Setup. This includes an Apple Watch that is already set up and updated to watchOS 26.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch For Your Kids lets parents set up an Apple Watch — a model with cellular connectivity is required — for a child who does not have their own iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
On the Apple Watch, Adaptive Power can help to extend battery life by adjusting the performance of certain features, according to an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123115">Apple support document</a>. Apple says Siri may take longer to process requests, and some animations and scrolling might appear less smooth on the screen, but it is unclear how often this will happen.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can turn off Adaptive Power on the child's Apple Watch, by opening the Settings app on it, tapping on Battery, and scrolling down to Adaptive Power.<br/>
<br/>
Adaptive Power is only available on Apple Watch units set up via Apple Watch For Your Kids.<br/>
<br/>
Adaptive Power mode is also available on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer running iOS 26, and it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/15/iphone-17-adaptive-power/">on by default on the iPhone 17 series and iPhone Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>
On the iPhone, Apple says the optional setting can make "performance adjustments" when necessary to extend battery life, including slightly lowering the display brightness, allowing some activities to "take longer," and automatically turning on Low Power Mode when remaining battery life reaches the 20% mark.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 11</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE 3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/apple-watch-for-kids-dynamic-power/">Apple Watch Gets New Mode to Extend Battery Life — But For Kids Only</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-gets-new-mode-to-extend-battery-life-—-but-for-kids-only.2466218/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
