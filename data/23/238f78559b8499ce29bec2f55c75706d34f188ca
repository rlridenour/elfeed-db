<p>By default <code>dired</code> orders its files in alphanumeric order and when <strong>s</strong> is selected it sorts by date according to :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(dired-sort-toggle-or-edit <span style="color:#66d9ef">&amp;optional</span> ARG)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But recently I wanted to list files according to their size, which of course is a very common thing to do especially when you are undertaking a nice spring clean up.</p>
<p>The solution is to modify the <code>dired-listing-switches</code> to add in an <strong>S</strong> argument which can be found by passing in the universal argument to <strong>s</strong>, hence : <code>C-u s</code></p>
<p>This presents the user with something like: <code>-al</code> at which point you can just tack <code>S</code> on the end to show <code>-alS</code></p>
<p>as the ls man page states the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">-S     sort by file size, largest first
</code></pre><p>and this is what we get:</p>

<p>a nice ordered listing, it is not something I do often and generally the standard dired sort toggle is all I need, but it is nice to know that this is available.</p>
