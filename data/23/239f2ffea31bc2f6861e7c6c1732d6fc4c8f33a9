<p>House Democrats in the United States have released hundreds of photos and several videos showing the interior and grounds of Jeffrey Epstein’s private island home in the US Virgin Islands, taken in 2020 after his death in custody in 2019. The material, obtained via a subpoena to the US Virgin Islands government, depicts bedrooms, bathrooms, an office-like room with a chalkboard, and a space containing a dentist-style chair and masks on the wall, in a property long linked to Epstein’s abuse of girls and young women. Democrats say the publication is intended to increase pressure on the Trump administration to fully comply with a legal requirement to release all remaining federal investigative files on Epstein by an approaching deadline, and to address what they describe as an ongoing lack of transparency around the case. While journalists note that the images themselves do not appear to reveal significant new information about how Epstein operated, lawmakers argue that fuller disclosure of official records is needed to support survivors and to clarify whether any influential associates were shielded from scrutiny.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wHBre3RMAtZDbGQkjz5COReJM668cJaRGRAGEGqIe1RAe8OTFujwUCPZx4bxLbnPhoP5YD7EIPis3IuTemj-ms5DYfkk14LS6PVZPuKbOd3ngLZzW9uckfWJVy0AjRF_mZu4Je448FixoZXo-7pQLRmLXM9r5blDEmi0qus_UlYJ7dH4vwrdU__MCwjQ-w' alt='A distant view of Jeffrey Epstein’s private island estate in the US Virgin Islands.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Dentist-style room: Several images show a room containing a chair resembling dental equipment, along with masks mounted on the wall, and US media have linked this to Epstein’s last girlfriend, a dentist who reportedly shared an office with one of his shell companies.</li><li>Chalkboard messages: One room includes a chalkboard on which words such as “fin”, “intellectual”, “deception” and “power” are written, offering a rare glimpse into how spaces inside the compound were arranged or themed but without clear explanation of their purpose.</li><li>Walk-through videos: The newly released videos function as a walk-through of the property, guiding viewers through living areas and exterior paths in a way that had not previously been available to the public.</li><li>Limited new evidence: Outlets including the South China Morning Post and The Straits Times report that, despite the volume of images, they add little concrete information about the mechanics of Epstein’s crimes or the identities of alleged accomplices.</li><li>Congressional strategy: Democratic lawmakers say they will keep pursuing what they call an end to any “cover-up”, arguing that publicly accessible files could help rebuild trust in institutions and demonstrate that no one is above the law.</li></ul><blockquote>We are going to keep fighting to end this cover-up, to deliver justice for the survivors, and to ensure that what happened here never happens again. - Representative Stacey Plaskett</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>House Democrats: They argue that releasing the images helps pressure the executive branch to release remaining Epstein-related investigative files and say they will continue pushing until they believe the case has been fully aired for survivors and the public.
