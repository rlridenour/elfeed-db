Apple just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-announces-new-airtag/">announced</a> a new model of the AirTag, which is set to feature longer range for item tracking, a louder speaker, and the same &#36;99 price tag for a 4-Pack. The first generation model is still a solid Bluetooth tracker, particularly at Amazon's &#36;29 discount this week.<br/>
