<p>In a <a href="https://archive.org/details/minduniquereview00schirich/page/128/mode/2up">1901 parody edition</a>, the journal <em>Mind!</em> offered £1,000 to any philosopher who could produce adequate documentary evidence that he:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knows what he means.</li>
<li>Knows what anyone else means.</li>
<li>Knows what everyone means.</li>
<li>Knows what anything means.</li>
<li>Knows what everything else means.</li>
<li>Means what he says.</li>
<li>Means what he means.</li>
<li>Means what everyone else means.</li>
<li>Means what everyone else says that he means.</li>
<li>Can express what he means.</li>
<li>Knows what it signifies what he means.</li>
<li>Knows what it matters what he signifies.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#8220;At first sight it might seem as though the Twelve Labours of Hercules would be in comparison with this a slighter achievement,&#8221; the editors wrote. &#8220;But in view of the extensive and peculiar knowledge of the Absolute&#8217;s Mind which is now possessed by so many philosophers, a large number of solutions may confidently be expected.&#8221;</p>
