<p>Time for a vacation again. I&rsquo;ve been responding to a couple of work emails this morning, even though I&rsquo;m off, and I suspect I&rsquo;ll probably answer a few more while I&rsquo;m away.</p>
<p>This vacation would be a good time to reflect on my workload and if I enjoy being so busy (I suspect that to a certain degree, I do. I get that guilty pleasure out of it). I also want to re-evaluate my org-mode setup, particularly the agenda and my calendar, and how to work with or around those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking my camera with me, and I hope to shake some rust off in the photography department. It would also be interesting to see how Journelly plays into all the locations ' &ldquo;check-ins&rdquo; I plan on doing. If anyone has a system like that in place, I&rsquo;d love to hear about it.</p>
<p>And&hellip; that&rsquo;s it I think. Not much more is planned besides general laziness and sleep, especially in the heat, away from the explosions of fireworks.</p>
