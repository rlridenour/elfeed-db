<p>John Oliver on Last Week Tonight, uh, last week, regarding Disney’s initial (but brief) caving to Trump’s demands that they suspend or even fire Jimmy Kimmel for his having the temerity to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/09/23/kimmel-joke">mock the mad king for being a sociopathic ghoul</a> sliding into the depths of dementia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look, at some point you’re going to have to draw a line. So I’d
argue, why not draw it right here? And when they come to you with
stupid, ridiculous demands, picking fights that you know you could
win in court, instead of rolling over, why not stand up and use
four key words they don’t tend to teach you in business school?
Not, “OK, you’re the boss.” Not, “Whatever you say goes.” But
instead, the only phrase that can genuinely make a weak bully go
away. And that is, “Fuck you. Make me.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Fuck you, make me” is, to me, the founding principle of this nation. That was our message to King George III, a tyrant descending into madness (who even <a href="https://www.hrp.org.uk/blog/the-kings-malady-george-iiis-mental-illness-explored/">suffered from swollen legs and feet</a>, which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-swelling-legs-chronic-venous-insufficiency-health-40beb3c818cfb914645db9d1f143fdd8">rings yet another bell</a> with our current wannabe mad king). And it needs to be our response to Trump.</p>
