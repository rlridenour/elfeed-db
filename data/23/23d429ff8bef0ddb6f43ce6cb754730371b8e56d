<p>The United States says it will suspend processing of immigrant visas for applicants from 75 countries starting January 21, affecting routes such as family-based, employment-based and diversity visas. The Trump administration links the move to the “public charge” provision, arguing it must prevent new immigrants from relying on public benefits funded by taxpayers. Officials say the pause will remain until the State Department reassesses screening procedures, while noting that tourist and business visas are not affected.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/YhpUo4WPKpJSQ7iQyGl0HffCgVtWruApVlJYIvM6lo4XyMuuc8YZ5w7Kj6F3dJj8dKh1x3Filee6qn6LNfmPLI3kPDMhk5qpEJTw11oIOwV6' alt='An undated image of the US State Department in Washington, DC. — AFP/File' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Countries named: Reports cite a broad list that includes Afghanistan, Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Russia, Somalia, Haiti, Bangladesh and Pakistan, spanning multiple regions.</li><li>Scope dispute: Firstpost reported the policy as a suspension of visa processing for “visitors” from 75 countries, while other outlets describe an immigrant-visa-only pause and explicitly say short-term visitor categories are not included.</li><li>Minnesota focus: Semafor says Trump officials have recently highlighted allegations that members of Minnesota’s Somali community defrauded social safety net programs as part of the broader public-benefits justification.</li><li>Research contrast: Semafor notes studies finding immigrants use less welfare than U.S.-born Americans, a point that contrasts with the administration’s stated rationale for the new screening emphasis.</li><li>Pakistan impact: Dawn reports the pause could disrupt plans for thousands of Pakistanis who seek U.S. immigrant visas each year, and says Pakistani consulates in the U.S. are expected to issue guidance to affected applicants.</li></ul><blockquote>We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused, - A US official</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US State Department: The department says it will pause immigrant visa processing to reassess procedures and use existing authority to deny applicants deemed likely to become a “public charge.”.
