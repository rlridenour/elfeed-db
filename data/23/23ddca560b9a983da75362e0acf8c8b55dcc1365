<p>Iceland’s public broadcaster RÚV has decided not to send an entry to the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest in Vienna, becoming the fifth country to boycott after organisers confirmed Israel will be allowed to compete despite the ongoing war in Gaza and recent voting disputes. The move follows a coordinated withdrawal last week by Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland and Slovenia, whose broadcasters had expected to vote on tougher rules after alleged irregularities in previous contests and concerns about Israel’s use of Eurovision for political messaging. RÚV said public debate in Iceland and reactions to the European Broadcasting Union’s (EBU) decision meant that participation would not bring “joy” or “peace,” and also disclosed that it had unsuccessfully requested the exclusion of Israel’s broadcaster KAN from the competition. The boycott adds to two years of protests and political tension around Eurovision linked to the conflict in Gaza, even as the event prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary in 2026 after a 2025 edition involving 37 countries and won by Austrian singer JJ, with Israel finishing second.</p><img src='' alt='Eurovision branding displayed on a large screen during a past contest in Europe.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>RÚV board decision: Iceland’s broadcaster delayed its decision until a formal board meeting, after which it announced that it would not participate in the Vienna contest and revealed it had earlier asked the EBU to remove Israel’s broadcaster KAN from the lineup.</li><li>Coordinated withdrawals: Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland and Slovenia announced a joint pull-out the previous week after meeting EBU organisers, acting together in response to both the Gaza conflict and disputes over how to address alleged past voting irregularities.</li><li>Shelved voting reforms: EBU members had expected to vote on new measures to tackle alleged voting irregularities at earlier contests, but organisers later said no vote was required, a decision that cleared the way for Israel’s continued participation.</li><li>Protests at recent contests: The Gaza war has sparked protests outside Eurovision venues for two consecutive years, prompting organisers to tighten rules on political flag‑waving and other expressions inside arenas.</li><li>Scale of the contest: The 2025 Eurovision featured entries from 37 countries and was won by Austrian operatic performer JJ, underlining how the long‑running show remains one of the world’s largest live music events ahead of its 70th anniversary edition in 2026.</li></ul><blockquote>Given the public debate in this country and the reactions to the decision of the EBU that was taken last week, it is clear that neither joy nor peace will prevail regarding the participation of RUV in Eurovision - RÚV board statement</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>RÚV (Icelandic broadcaster): RÚV stated that after the EBU’s decision and the debate in Iceland, participation would not bring the sense of joy and peace the broadcaster expects from Eurovision, so it chose to stay out of the 2026 event.
