God of hope and joy,
</p>

 <p>
You are with me, <br></br>
and in your presence, <br></br>
I will not be afraid
</p>

 <p>
of the world, <br></br>
for it is your creation;
</p>

 <p>
of the future, <br></br>
for you have already redeemed it;
</p>

 <p>
of the unknown, <br></br>
for surely you have seen it;
</p>

 <p>
of the stranger, <br></br>
for she was made in your image,
</p>

 <p>
of my weakness, <br></br>
for you will give me strength.
</p>

 <p>
of the darkness, <br></br>
For I carry the light with me.
</p>

 <p>
You are there, <br></br>
and I am not alone.
</p>

 <p>
I will not be afraid.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
