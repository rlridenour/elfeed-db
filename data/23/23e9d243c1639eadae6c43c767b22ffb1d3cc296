<p>On his 84th birthday this past Saturday, Bob Dylan played a show. That was in keeping with not only his <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/setlists/bob-dylan-1bd6adb8.html">still-serious touring schedule</a>, but also his apparently irrepressible instinct to work: on music, on writing, on painting, on sculpture. Even his <a href="https://x.com/bobdylan" rel="nofollow">occasional tweeting</a> draws an appreciative audience every time. The Bob Dylan of 2025 is not, of course, the Bob Dylan of 1965, but then, the Bob Dylan of 1965 wasn’t the Bob Dylan of 1964. This constant artistic change is just what his fans appreciate, not that they don’t still put on his early stuff with regularity.</p>
<p>In the earliest of that early stuff, as music YouTuber David Hartley explains in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEtiECT9Gdk">the new video above</a>, Dylan “wrote songs by reinventing tradition.” Using nothing but his voice, guitar, and harmonica, the young Dylan “imitated some of the most well-known folk melodies,” placing himself in that long American tradition of borrowing and reinterpretation. But as dramatized in the recent film <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2025/01/compare-the-it-aint-me-babe-scene-from-a-complete-unknown-to-the-real-bob-dylan-joan-baez.html"><em>A Complete Unknown</em></a>, he soon “went electric,” and with the change in instrumentation came a change in songwriting method: “He would just come up with endless pages of lyrics, something he once called ‘the long piece of vomit.’&nbsp;”</p>

<p>The advice to “puke it out now and clean it up later” has long been given, in various forms, to aspiring artists everywhere. One aspect worth highlighting about the way Dylan did it was that, despite writing popular songs, he drew a great deal of inspiration from more traditional literature, to the point that his notes hardly appear to contain anything resembling verses or choruses at all. Only in the studio, with a band behind him, could Dylan give these ideas their final musical shape — or rather, their final shape on that particular album, often to be modified endlessly, and sometimes radically, over decades of live performances to come.</p>
<p>Hartley tells of more dramatic changes to Dylan’s music and his process of creating. The motorcycle crash, the <em>Basement Tapes</em>, the open E tuning, <em>Blood on the Tracks</em>: all of these now lie half a century or more in the past. To go over all the ways Dylan has approached music since then would require more hours than all but the most rabid enthusiasts (though there are many) would watch. The video does include a <em>60 Minutes</em> clip from 2004 in which Dylan says that “those early songs were almost magically written,” and that he wouldn’t be able to create them anymore. But then, nor could the Dylan of <em>Highway 61 Revisited </em>have recorded <em>Time Out of Mind</em>, and nor, for that matter, could the Dylan of <em>Time Out of Mind </em>have recorded any of Dylan’s albums from this decade — or those that could, quite possibly, be still to come.</p>
