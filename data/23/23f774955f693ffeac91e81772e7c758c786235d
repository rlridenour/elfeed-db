<p>US President Donald Trump said he is considering deploying a second aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East, pairing a show of force with renewed diplomacy as Washington and Tehran prepare to resume negotiations aimed at avoiding a wider conflict. He said there is a limited window for diplomacy and warned the US would do “something very tough” if the sides fail to reach an agreement. The planned talks follow indirect discussions in Oman last week that both sides described positively, with another round expected soon. The central dispute remains Iran’s nuclear programme, and the negotiations are focused on preventing a wider escalation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/n-wCrPMT0Mj3lFU3EDo7k6v1SzzOWXcN6oaG7l8Cr1xoceGSUTHm4XTx0M07S5DIpHaU12QJ4tZC7GQLaWCGzTI9IhBwXQrlPh7hKiKakAQs' alt='US President Donald Trump attends an event in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, DC, on September 2, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Oman channel: Iran said the Oman-mediated talks helped it gauge Washington’s seriousness, and that there was enough consensus to keep diplomacy moving.</li><li>Pressure message: Trump told Axios the carrier deployments are meant to underline the US willingness to use force, and said Iran is now taking the talks more seriously.</li><li>Domestic backdrop: Dawn reported the standoff also comes as the US criticises Iran’s recent crackdown on protesters—an issue Trump has cited in earlier warnings.</li></ul><blockquote>Either we reach a deal, or we’ll have to do something very tough - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US President Donald Trump: Trump said he is weighing sending another carrier group and cast it as leverage to secure a deal, warning that the alternative would be “something very tough.” (<a href='https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/trump-hints-at-second-carrier-in-middle-east-as-iran-and-us-near-talks'>The Straits Times</a>)</li><li>Iranian officials: Iranian officials have described the Oman talks as a constructive start.
