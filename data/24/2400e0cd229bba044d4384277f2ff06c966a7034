<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/">Apple One</a> allows you to subscribe to a bundle of up to six of Apple's services for a discounted all-in-one monthly price, and its value just went up in an artificial way.<br/>

The reason why Apple One just became more valuable is because <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/21/apple-tv-plus-price-increase-announced/">Apple TV+ received a price increase</a> this week in the U.S. and select other countries. In the U.S., for example, the cost of the service increased from &#36;9.99 per month to &#36;12.99 per month. However, <strong>Apple One plans with Apple TV+ did not receive any corresponding price increases</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
There are three Apple One tiers, all with Apple TV+ included:<ul><li><strong>Individual</strong> (&#36;19.95/month): Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and iCloud+ (50GB)</li><br/>
<li><strong>Family</strong> (&#36;25.95/month): Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and iCloud+ (200GB)</li><br/>
<li><strong>Premier</strong> (&#36;37.95/month): Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, and iCloud+ (2TB)</li></ul>All in all, you can now potentially save even more money by switching to Apple One as opposed to paying for Apple TV+ and other services separately.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you can switch to the annual Apple TV+ subscription, which also avoided a price increase. In the U.S., that plan remains available for &#36;99 per year.<br/>
<br/>
Many streaming services like Disney+ and HBO Max offer annual plans at a discount compared to paying for 12 months individually, although it is worth keeping in mind that there is an opportunity cost to paying in full upfront.<br/>
<br/>
This is a win-win situation for Apple, which gains an instant revenue boost from customers who stick with the monthly Apple TV+ plan, while boosting the appeal of its Apple One and annual Apple TV+ plans with a higher spend or longer commitment.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/22/apple-one-just-became-more-valuable/">Apple One Just Became More Valuable Than Ever</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-one-just-became-more-valuable-than-ever.2463823/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
