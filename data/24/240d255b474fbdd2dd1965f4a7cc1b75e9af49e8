<p>From Apple’s Xcode 26 Beta 7 release notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><p>Claude in Xcode is now available in the Intelligence settings
panel, allowing users to seamlessly add their existing paid
Claude account to Xcode and start using Claude Sonnet 4.
(155826755)</p></li>
<li><p>When using ChatGPT in Xcode, users can now start a new
conversation with either GPT-4.1 or GPT-5, with GPT-5 set as the
default. (158342780)</p></li>
<li><p>ChatGPT in Xcode provides two model choices. “GPT-5” is
optimized for quick, high-quality results, and should work well
for most coding tasks. For difficult tasks, choose “GPT-5
(Reasoning)“, which spends more time thinking before responding,
and can provide more accurate results for complex coding tasks.</p>

<p>In the OpenAI API, “GPT-5” corresponds to the “minimal”
reasoning level, and “GPT-5 (Reasoning)” corresponds to the
“low” reasoning level. (159135374)</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s just three weeks from the <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/">launch of ChatGPT 5</a> to shipping support in Xcode. Also, these are just the built-in integrations. As announced at WWDC, Xcode 26 allows developers to use their API keys from other AI providers, or connect to models running locally, on-device (if they’re using an Apple Silicon Mac).</p>
