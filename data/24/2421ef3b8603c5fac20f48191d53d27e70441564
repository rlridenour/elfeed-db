<p>A fresh U.S. Justice Department release of roughly three million additional pages tied to Jeffrey Epstein is reverberating well beyond the United States, prompting public denials, political pressure, and at least one high-level resignation abroad. Multiple outlets emphasize that appearing in the records—or having communications included—is not, by itself, proof of wrongdoing, but the disclosures are intensifying scrutiny of how Epstein built and maintained access to prominent figures across politics, business, and culture. Among the most immediate institutional fallout, LA28 chair Casey Wasserman apologized for decades-old flirtatious email exchanges with Ghislaine Maxwell while denying ties to Epstein, as Olympics officials warned that distractions are unwelcome in the run-up to the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Elsewhere, the documents highlight global links—from communications involving business leaders to political figures referenced in emails—fueling new debate in several countries about transparency, ethics, and the consequences of proximity to Epstein’s network.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/5l_HsrB5_-WW-xoX2BUCRrd4HLJGBOO_Z8l1P6wq-VR1qtCuoJgdqfkA1uhuG6KVf5_hk0ZHLAvQz-Up_izUfOB-AsSc0Jx4vbIo3Vnq5A7m5OJe67jAnePxbcjndyxBFAGgjMetlgvfuQZgj8H2vOvrsBPfMp6KnQU1z1c8Qc7mii8lnuoKoyDb9By2Dit2iK18hFfdJQ1QUPnHOUmqIKdDRFXHNK3Lv3m3YrV6PApbbDUrWQ8D3B75fWPRiU06rYm2zU30hPwS86bJEg' alt='LA28 chairperson Casey Wasserman speaks at a June 2025 press conference; he later apologized for flirty emails with Ghislaine Maxwell.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Slovak resignation: Slovakia’s national security adviser resigned after his name appeared among those who allegedly corresponded with Epstein, saying he was stepping down to avoid political costs for Prime Minister Robert Fico while denying wrongdoing.</li><li>Shipping executive: Emails released by the DOJ show DP World chief Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem discussed a masseuse with Epstein, which the Financial Times described as indicating a close relationship.</li><li>Epstein interview: The newly released materials include video of Epstein being questioned in an interview, with the interviewer asking, “Do you think you’re the devil himself?”.</li><li>South Asia references: Pakistan’s Dawn reported the files include emails where polio efforts and security risks for polio teams in Pakistan and Nigeria came up in discussions involving Epstein and Bill Gates’ teams, alongside other scattered references to Pakistan and India.</li><li>Argentina mention: MercoPress reported the new trove includes records that mention a prominent Argentine businessman, underscoring how the disclosures are drawing attention across Latin America as well.</li></ul><blockquote>Not because I did anything criminal or unethical, - Miroslav Lajcak</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. Justice Department (DOJ): The DOJ released millions of additional pages—along with videos and images, according to Argentina-focused reporting—under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, expanding the public record around Epstein’s contacts.
