A second-generation iPhone Air is "not expected this year," according to a <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/apple-to-prioritize-premium-iphone-launches-in-2026-amid-memory-crunch"><em>Nikkei Asia</em> report</a> today that cites people familiar with Apple's supply chain.<br/>

The report said Apple plans to release an iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and foldable iPhone later this year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/30/apples-split-iphone-launch-strategy-latest-report/">followed by the base model iPhone 18 in the first half of next year</a>. The report said Apple does have a revamped iPhone Air in the pipeline, but the publication does not expect it to launch until at least 2027.<br/>
<br/>
While one leaker on the Chinese social media platform Weibo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/iphone-air-minor-refresh-this-year-claims-leaker/">has insisted</a> that the iPhone Air will receive a spec bump this year, most reports from sources <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/16/when-to-expect-iphone-air-2-and-iphone-20/">such as <em>Bloomberg</em></a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/11/report-delayed-iphone-air-2-second-camera/">and <em>The Information</em></a> have pointed to an early 2027 launch. If so, the iPhone Air 2 would likely be released alongside the base model iPhone 18.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, <em>The Information</em> reported that Apple was aiming to add a second rear camera to the next iPhone Air. That report added that the next iPhone Air could weigh less, have a larger battery capacity, and gain a vapor chamber cooling system like the iPhone 17 Pro models have. And <em>Bloomberg</em> expects the device to have a 2nm chip.<br/>

While several reports indicated that the iPhone Air has been in low demand, the extreme popularity of the iPhone 17 base model and the iPhone 17 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/iphone-demand-simply-staggering/">led iPhone revenue to a new all-time high</a> last quarter, according to Apple.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/">Nikkei</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/30/no-iphone-air-2-this-year-says-report/">Will the iPhone Air 2 Launch This Year?
