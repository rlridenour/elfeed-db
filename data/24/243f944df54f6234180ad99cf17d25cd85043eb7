<p>The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that would
help clear the way for a coalition of investors to run an American
version of TikTok, one that is separate from its Chinese owner,
ByteDance, so that it can keep operating in the United States.</p>

<p>The administration has been working for months to find non-Chinese
investors for a U.S. TikTok company, which Vice President JD Vance
said would be valued at $14 billion. [...]</p>

<p>The White House hasn’t said exactly who would own the U.S. version
of TikTok, but the list of potential investors includes several
powerful allies of Mr. Trump. The software giant Oracle, whose
co-founder is the billionaire Larry Ellison, will take a stake in
U.S. TikTok. Mr. Trump has also said that the media mogul Rupert
Murdoch is involved. A person familiar with the talks said the
Murdoch investments would come through Fox Corporation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>$14 billion is a ridiculous valuation. The whole thing is ridiculous, of course, but a fair valuation on the open market would surely be at least 10× that value. They’re not even pretending this is on the up-and-up. And it doesn’t answer the core problem at the heart of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/tiktok">the PAFACA Act</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who is
focused on U.S.-China relations, said the White House’s executive
order would stoke those questions only because it says “the
divestiture includes intense monitoring of software updates,
algorithms and data flows.”</p>

<p>“If you control it, why would you need intense monitoring to know
what’s happening with it?” Mr. Sobolik said. “Monitoring the
algorithm is not the same as controlling it. That’s the head fake the
administration appears to be trying to pull here.”</p>
