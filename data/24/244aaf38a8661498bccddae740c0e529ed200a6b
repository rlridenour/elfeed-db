We're expecting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/26/apple-september-9-event-rumors/">a number of announcements at the event</a>, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/27/apple-event-logo-hints-at-iphone-17-pro-features/">Apple's event logo potentially hinting</a> at a few aspects of the upcoming iPhone models. Apple reportedly has a host of product launches planned for the coming months, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/28/what-not-to-expect-apple-iphone-17-event/">many of them won't be appearing</a> at next month's event in order to spread things out and keep the focus on the new flagship iPhone models and related products.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>iPhone 17 Air is Launching Soon, Here Are All the Rumors</h3><br/>
While we're getting four new iPhone models at Apple's upcoming event, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17-air-rumors/">most intriguing one is the so-called "iPhone 17 Air,"</a> a new ultra-thin model replacing the traditional Plus model in the lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Air-Dummy-Thumb-2.75.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010200" /><br/>
We're expecting a thin body of around 5.5mm with a wide rear camera bump, a 6.6-inch display, just one rear camera, and an ultra-thin battery that will result in shorter battery life than other models, but some users may find that tradeoff worth it.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Apple Has Reportedly Considered Releasing iPhone 17 Air Bumper Case</h3><br/>
We're continuing to hear more about potential accessories for the iPhone 17 lineup, and beyond a battery case to help give the iPhone 17 Air additional battery life, we're now hearing that Apple has at least <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/iphone-17-air-bumper-case-rumor/">considered releasing iPhone 4-style bumper cases</a> with no rear panel in an effort to provide some protection while still emphasizing the thinness of the new model.<br/>

In other case news, previous reports of a new "TechWoven" material have been joined by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/25/apple-liquid-silicone-iphone-17-case-colors/">rumored colors for "Liquid Silicone" cases</a> similar to those Apple has offered for many years. And finally, we've seen our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/28/iphone-17-crossbody-strap-magnetic-design/">first alleged look at the Crossbody Strap accessory</a> that will be able to attach to Apple's new cases.<br/>

<h3>iPhone 17 Pro Coming Soon With These 12 New Features</h3><br/>

Following the new ultra-thin Air model this year, we should see Apple introduce its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/foldable-iphone-rumored-features/">first foldable iPhone next year</a>, and in 2027 we may see a special 20th-anniversary model with a wraparound display and no bezels at all.<br/>

The earbuds themselves may also see a redesign to shrink the size a bit and allow for a better fit.<br/>
