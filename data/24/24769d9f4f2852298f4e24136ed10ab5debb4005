<p>President Donald Trump said he will seek a $1.5 trillion U.S. military budget for 2027, framing the request as a response to what he called “troubled and dangerous times” and promising a “dream military”. He argued that revenues from his administration’s sweeping tariffs could help fund the increase. The proposal would further widen the U.S. lead in global military spending, and some coverage notes it could intensify competition with other major powers even as supporters argue it could strengthen deterrence.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/I65Ce-6WuGvihas3pnoau2Ym1LEWSDbK_4gfNappg2u9jSnGlq3I4YUMc2Pda5Wg9c1TO5oIkkA30mABCcDvHfMSkajCJf-0pR7wjPMrKaDWMiDBQYk-TJtulLWk9DGrcyW9X0uZMKdqGSukE0SJNL4aBrl8Dxb-9q7NcFiGF67oLHtZIkQkdgxW4dZhYPN1LfdAtB1emqHSu2rlY5ZBj5cYkaHxaAZ61XBfg1gYWhYVhXT8qz7xCFS4iP_GBbKjNOHluMmI85vbGzAg0g' alt='U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to House Republican lawmakers during their annual policy retreat in Washington, January 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Contractor pressure: Trump said defense firms should boost manufacturing output and warned of a crackdown on shareholder payouts, including restricting dividends and stock buybacks until production improves.</li><li>Executive pay cap: He called on defense contractors to cap executives’ pay until new production plants are built, linking compensation to expanded capacity.</li><li>Base budget context: Reporting highlighted that the 2026 military budget was set at $901 billion, underscoring how large a 2027 jump would be in nominal terms.</li><li>Debt-cost estimate: A U.S. budget watchdog group estimated the proposal would cost about $5 trillion through 2035 and could add $5.8 trillion to U.S. debt when interest is included, while also arguing existing tariffs might cover only about half the cost and could face legal risk.</li><li>Programs in view: Some U.S. defense priorities cited as costly drivers include Trump’s “Golden Dome” air-defense effort and his call for a new battleship design, which Politico reported would be difficult to fund under current levels.</li></ul><blockquote>This will allow us to build the ‘Dream Military’ that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: Trump argued a much larger 2027 military budget is needed for security in “troubled and dangerous times,” and he said tariff revenue could help pay for it.
