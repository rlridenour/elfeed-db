<p>President Trump said he will likely sue the BBC next week for between $1 billion and $5 billion over a Panorama edit of his January 6, 2021, speech, after his lawyers set an earlier deadline demanding a retraction and at least $1 billion in damages. The BBC issued an apology, called the edit an &quot;error of judgement&quot; and said it would not rebroadcast the segment, but it rejected the defamation claim and declined to offer financial compensation. The row has provoked a governance crisis inside the broadcaster: two senior leaders have resigned and the BBC chair sent a personal apology to the White House, while the dispute adds a diplomatic layer as Mr Trump says he will raise the matter with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/EYNu3-WrR4RNNTDcFpAHK8cCl3fuOXMb6edbl1CJwmuLQkR_BnBxcJF9LNBvopgbB_Kqb1jBGXAoRCMjg9EDpFaniBs9ePEIAwVvX91pJGlIznFSkORmf_1i5TLirYoOb39-AiopwXbtYS-49rUXkMweUyX8FASHljMD_iC7BQi9A_dNc3zFAFvjdIzHgfdscPdJhLu8uFFUI5Fcitmf9KApAtxYFs2U6-MvnhxiP-y4L315oUrBcF8mfQ' alt='US President Donald Trump said he plans to sue the BBC for &quot;between a billion and five billion dollars&quot;.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Litigation record: Trump has filed high-profile suits against US media companies before; one recent case against Paramount — originally a $20 billion claim — ended in a $16 million settlement, a precedent that illustrates the range between headline damages and final payouts.</li><li>How it was made: Broadcasters and reporters say the Panorama documentary spliced together three separate excerpts of the January 6 speech and was produced by a third-party production company, which BBC editors later judged created a misleading impression.</li><li>Pressures before apology: Scrutiny intensified after parts of an internal dossier prepared by the BBC&#x27;s adviser on standards were published by the Daily Telegraph earlier in November, increasing pressure on the organisation to respond quickly.</li><li>Broadcasting response: Alongside resignations, the BBC confirmed the Panorama segment will not be rebroadcast and issued a formal apology directly to the White House, while maintaining it does not accept the legal basis for Trump&#x27;s claim.</li></ul><blockquote>We’ll sue them for anywhere between $1 billion and $5 billion, probably sometime next week, - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He says the BBC &#x27;changed the words coming out of my mouth&#x27; and that the broadcaster &#x27;cheated&#x27;, adding he intends to file suit for $1bn–$5bn and will press the issue with UK leaders.
