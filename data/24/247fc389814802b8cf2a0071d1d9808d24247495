<p><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/marcel-duchamp-1887-1968">Marcel Duchamp</a> (1887–1968) made some heady art. His whole goal was to “put art back in the service of the mind,” or to create what Jasper Johns once called the “field where language, thought and vision act on one another.” And that’s precisely what Duchamp’s 1926 avant-garde film&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXINTf8kXCc">Anémic Cinéma</a></em> delivers. You can watch a restored version above.</p>
<p>Drawing on his&nbsp;inheritance, Duchamp shot&nbsp;<em>Anémic Cinéma </em>(almost a palindrome) in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Ray">Man Ray’s</a> studio with the help of cinematographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_All%C3%A9gret">Marc Allégret</a>. The Dada-inspired film features nine whirling optical illusions, known as Rotoreliefs, alternating with spiraling puns and complex word play. Vision acts on language and thought, indeed.</p>
<p><em>Anémic Cinéma </em>appears in our collection, <a href="https://www.openculture.com/freemoviesonline">4,000+ Free Movies Online: Great Classics, Indies, Noir, Westerns, Documentaries &amp; More</a>.</p>
