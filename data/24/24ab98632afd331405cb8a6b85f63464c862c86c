The "T-Satellite" <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">Starlink satellite</a> service that T-Mobile has been testing for the last several months is now out of beta, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert <a href="https://x.com/mikesievert/status/1948032032396968247">announced today</a>.<br/>

Satellite-based connectivity is available for T-Mobile subscribers, but it is also an option for Verizon and AT&amp;T users. T-Mobile's offering uses over 650 Starlink satellites to allow users to send text messages when they are out of range of a cellular or Wi-Fi connection.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile says that its satellite services work with more than 600 smartphones, including iPhones. If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14 or later, you can use T-Satellite, though these devices already have Apple's built-in satellite functionality that works with Globalstar satellites. You will need iOS 18.3 or later to sign up.<br/>
<br/>
The T-Mobile satellite service is limited to texting with iMessage and SMS, and data is not supported. Apple's built-in satellite service supports sending and receiving messages, sharing location via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a>, connecting with emergency services, getting satellite-based weather updates, and arranging roadside assistance via satellite. Apple does not yet charge for any of its Satellite functionality.<br/>
<br/>
T-Satellite is free for Beyond 5G and Go5G customers, while T-Mobile users with other plans can get the service added to their plans for &#36;10 per month using the Manage Add-Ons option in their accounts. AT&amp;T and Verizon customers can get T-Satellite for &#36;10 per month by contacting T-Mobile customer support. The &#36;10/month pricing is a limited-time promotion, and T-Mobile intends to raise the price to &#36;15 per month in the future.<br/>

&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who sign up for T-Mobile's satellite service and connect to a Starlink satellite will see a small "SAT" icon in the status bar<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/23/t-mobile-starlink-launch/">T-Mobile&#039;s Starlink Satellite Service Officially Launches With iPhone Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobiles-starlink-satellite-service-officially-launches-with-iphone-support.2462099/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
