While the iPhone Air is equipped with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-air-c1x-modem/">Apple's custom C1X modem</a> for cellular connectivity, all of the iPhone 17 models are outfitted with Qualcomm modems still.<br/>

A <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1DHWGzFECm">teardown video</a> shared on Chinese platform Bilibili today (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1nkwwwu/breakdown_of_17_pro_max_shows_a_qualcomm_x80_modem/">Reddit</a>) appears to confirm the iPhone 17 Pro Max is equipped with Qualcomm's <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/technology/modems/snapdragon-x80-5g-modem-rf-system">Snapdragon X80 modem</a> in particular. The same modem is likely used in the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Qualcomm says the Snapdragon X80 contains AI accelerator hardware that intelligently enhances cellular data speeds, latency, coverage, and power efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the Snapdragon X80 modem supports mmWave 5G, which is available on iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max models sold in the U.S. only. Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">C1 modem in the iPhone 16e</a> and C1X modem in the iPhone Air are limited to sub-6GHz 5G.<br/>
<br/>
mmWave is a set of 5G frequencies that promise ultra-fast speeds at short distances, which is ideal for dense urban areas. By comparison, sub-6GHz 5G is generally slower than mmWave, but the signals travel further, better serving suburban and rural areas.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 18 Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/apple-c2-modem-iphone-18-pro-feature/">expected to use Apple's custom C2 modem</a>, with mmWave 5G support, as Apple continues to phase out Qualcomm modems.<br/>
<br/>
The Snapdragon X80 is already outdated. Qualcomm has since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/qualcomm-claims-x85-modem-better-than-apple/">unveiled its Snapdragon X85 modem</a>, and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said Android smartphones using it would have a "huge delta" in performance compared to iPhones. <br/>
<br/>
We are still waiting for Snapdragon X80 vs. C1X speed tests.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/">Teardown</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-17">iPhone 17 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-17-Pro">iPhone 17 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/19/iphone-17-pro-max-qualcomm-snapdragon-x80/">iPhone 17 Pro Max Teardown Reveals Qualcomm&#039;s Snapdragon X80 Modem for 5G</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-max-teardown-reveals-qualcomms-snapdragon-x80-modem-for-5g.2466588/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
