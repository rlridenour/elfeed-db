<p>Tanzania’s government cancelled public Independence Day celebrations and banned demonstrations as security forces flooded major cities to deter planned protests over alleged abuses during October’s elections. Police and soldiers patrolled largely deserted streets in Dar es Salaam and other urban centres after authorities urged people to stay home and the prime minister asked non-essential workers not to report to work. Activists and opposition figures had called for peaceful rallies to denounce what they describe as violent suppression of post-election dissent, but police warned that any gathering would be illegal and could lead to arrests. Officials say the tightened security aims to preserve peace and national unity, while critics argue it reflects shrinking space for assembly and political expression in one of East Africa’s largest democracies.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DXcPe-uUd7IAlc6vUhJmjO-3FC-KzxfKR5qVq8ggKLvDtsNP5EPD5-WkhUej7YS563yCBw3zwQwuYxtnsCA9_tZp651BON5CGKCqQo67-69NJW5dl_XaS1jn5DYGGZOggPJIwXNLGzu6qTA_CwIr77nUXV3F6TLvT2oZ8vaLOg' alt='Police officers patrol a quiet street in Dar es Salaam during Tanzania’s Independence Day holiday as authorities move to prevent planned protests over the October election.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Security measures: Authorities deployed both police and army units around symbolic sites and key junctions in Dar es Salaam, including near the presidential palace and main roads leading into the city.</li><li>Transport restrictions: Public transport services were halted in parts of the country, limiting movement between residential areas and city centres on the holiday.</li><li>Banned activities: Police warned that even wearing certain colours, blowing whistles or holding placards linked to the protest call would be treated as participation in an unlawful gathering.</li><li>Opposition objectives: Organisers of the planned demonstrations said they wanted an independent investigation into deaths and injuries allegedly caused by security forces during and after the October vote.</li><li>Government justification: Officials framed the restrictions as necessary to prevent what they described as attempts to destabilise the country under the guise of commemorations and political rallies.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Tanzanian government: Officials argue that suspending Independence Day events and discouraging public gatherings is a temporary step to safeguard peace and avert unrest following heightened political tensions around the October elections.
