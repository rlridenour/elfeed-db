<p>The whole illustration is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/milk-and-cookies-tim-cook-keith-thomson.png">just weird looking</a>, for one thing. As for sloppy details, the tree is in soft focus but somehow has a crisp edge, the carton is labeled both “Whole Milk” and “Lowfat Milk”, and the “Cow Fun Puzzle” maze is just goofily wrong. (I can’t recall ever seeing a puzzle of any kind on a milk carton, because they’re waxy and hard to write on. It’s like a conflation of milk cartons and cereal boxes.)</p>

<p>[<strong>Update, 29 December:</strong> Turns out, the “lowfat” milk carton props from the actual show <a href="https://x.com/lionesspike/status/1999675978650648889">have the same mistake</a> with “whole milk” printed above. That doesn’t change that it’s a stupid mistake to copy, or that there are a slew of other telltale signs that the image was generated by AI.]</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/appletv/status/2003927243245203539">The Apple TV X account retweeted Cook</a>, and added a credit: “We thought you might like this festive artwork by Keith Thomson, made on MacBook Pro.”</p>

<p>Apple didn’t tag the “Keith Thomson” who supposedly created this artwork for them, but if it’s <a href="https://www.keiththomsonart.com/">this Keith Thomson</a>, Apple must have somehow fallen for a scam, because <em>that</em> Keith Thomson’s published paintings are wonderful. It does seem to be <a href="https://x.com/flyosity/status/2004010434844938312">that Keith Thomson’s signature</a> on Apple’s sloppy illustration, though. (I like a bunch of the paintings from that Keith Thomson, and love a few of them, but <a href="https://www.keiththomsonart.com/?itemId=id1bethwvp1f2b3fsm5np1sg5i9p50">this one in particular</a> feels like it was made just for me. It’s perfect.)</p>
