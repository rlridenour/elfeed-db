Being a basically boring guy, I almost always have a full screen frame with two side-by-side windows for Emacs. For some functions—Magit and Elfeed are examples—I temporarily pop up a single full frame window but the previous window configuration is restored when I finish. Some of you, I know, lead less constrained lives and have more complicated window configurations.

People with these more interesting configurations sometimes want to move their windows around. When you have two side-by-side windows, that&rsquo;s trivial—basically <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>u</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd> is all you have to know—but if you have different sized windows stacked both vertically and horizontally, things can get more complicated.

Pranshu has <a href="https://p.bauherren.ovh/blog/tech/new_window_cmds">a nice post</a> that describes the problem and what he&rsquo;s done to address it. The changes won&rsquo;t appear until Emacs 31 but for those of you with complex window configurations they will surely be welcome.

Take a look at his post to see the sorts of transformations that are possible and the commands that implement them. To tell the truth, they make me dizzy and I&rsquo;m happy to stay with my simple configuration but as always Emacs is able to adjust to everyone&rsquo;s needs.</p>
