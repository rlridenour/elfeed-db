<p>Affirmation. It&#8217;s natural to want it and to be encouraged by it. If deserved, it&#8217;s good to give. And giving it to your students can help grow your department&#8217;s enrollments and majors.<span id="more-53504"></span></p>

<p>This is the sixth installment in the occasional <a class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" href="https://dailynous.com/tag/philosophy-department-survival-strategies/">Philosophy Department Survival Strategies</a> series.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s strategy: instructors contacting promising students of theirs individually to praise them for their work so far and encourage them to take another step into philosophy.</p>
<p>That next step might be to take a particular class that you or a colleague are teaching, to join an occasional reading group or informal independent study, to attend a philosophy department event, to become a philosophy major or minor, etc.</p>
<p>For example, an instructor might write to a student something like the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I&#8217;ve really been impressed with your work in this course. Your last paper was really well-argued, and I&#8217;ve appreciated many of your insightful comments in class about the readings. I can also see the occasional frustration on your face when you think the discussion isn&#8217;t getting at what you think are the important points. I take that as a good sign&#8212;you have your own interest in some of these topics beyond what we have been able to do in class this term, especially, it seems, the topics that seem to  science. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m writing to you. Professor Jones is teaching an upper level course on consciousness next term. She&#8217;s a great teacher, and I think you&#8217;ll really get a lot from her course. And given what I&#8217;ve seen from you this term, I have every reason to think you&#8217;ll do quite well in it. I&#8217;d be happy to talk more about this with you, if you&#8217;d like, and about other courses&#8212;just let me know.</em></p>
<p>Now is a good time for this kind of reaching out.</p>
<p>As semesters wrap up, it&#8217;s easy to be busy and forget to do something like this, or to push it to the back burner. Departments may want to assign a faculty member the task of reminding others to take a few minutes to send a few notes out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are variations on this, or related strategies, that professors and departments make use of. Any and all suggestions in the vicinity are welcome.
