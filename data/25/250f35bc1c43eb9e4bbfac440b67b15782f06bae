iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max models can be charged up to 50% in around 20 minutes with a compatible USB-C power adapter, according to Apple's website.<br/>

That means iPhone 17 models offer faster USB-C charging compared to iPhone 16 models, which can be charged up to 50% in around 30 minutes with a compatible adapter.<br/>
<br/>
The ultra-thin iPhone Air has similar USB-C charging speeds as the iPhone 16 series.<br/>
<br/>
One power adapter that supports the iPhone 17's faster wired charging capabilities is Apple's new <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGKN4AM/A/40w-dynamic-power-adapter-with-60w-max">40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max</a>. It is available to order starting today, with pricing set at &#36;39 in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
As its Dynamic Power name implies, this charger can dynamically deliver up to 60W of power, despite having a smaller form factor. However, due to the thermal limitations of its compact design, the charger can only reach that 60W peak in short bursts. A larger 60W-or-higher charger does not face that limitation.<br/>
<br/>
Know that you do not need to use this specific new Apple power adapter to unlock the iPhone 17's faster charging — most higher-wattage chargers should do the trick.<br/>
<br/>
Also, remember that Apple sells USB-C charging cables separately.<br/>

iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max models can be pre-ordered starting this Friday at 5 a.m. Pacific Time, and the devices launch on Friday, September 19.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-models-faster-usb-c-charging/">iPhone 17 Models Feature Faster USB-C Charging With Apple&#039;s New &#039;Dynamic&#039; Power Adapter</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-models-feature-faster-usb-c-charging-with-apples-new-dynamic-power-adapter.2465060/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
