<p>The United States and Switzerland announced a framework memorandum of understanding that would cut US tariffs on Swiss imports from 39% to 15%, bringing Swiss duties in line with those applied to the European Union, in a deal welcomed by both governments. The White House said Swiss companies have pledged up to $200 billion in investments in the United States by the end of 2028, with at least $67 billion expected in 2026, and officials framed the move as opening markets and creating jobs in key industries such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The agreement is a non-binding memorandum and negotiators aim to finalise a formal trade deal by the first quarter of 2026, while customs-system adjustments mean the lower rate could take effect within days or weeks once implemented.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/dLlJi5A5-sWfpNwKiRH5BPep2mt9qGb34-bs21_gNPxOa02bVlwDYxXeM4stgAeghzGmOmHcJonfTBBH_GX-FMUjCLft0yk2kwBaaNF8YrWEpItQ7CieCLsc46cgseQwqUmqJxyTVW7m5mcHmIfdC5aoUHtTHgnWWQ0' alt='Coverage of the US–Switzerland tariff framework announced in November 2025' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Export coverage: The tariff cut would affect roughly 40% of Switzerland’s exports, according to Swiss officials describing the deal’s scope.</li><li>Investment timing: Of the $200 billion in pledged Swiss investment into the US, the White House said at least $67 billion is expected to arrive in 2026, targeting pharmaceuticals, medical devices, aerospace and gold manufacturing.</li><li>Legal form: Officials described the announcement as a non-binding memorandum of understanding rather than a final treaty, signalling more detailed negotiations ahead before legal commitments are signed.</li><li>Small partner included: Liechtenstein joined Switzerland in the framework talks with the United States, indicating the agreement’s scope extends beyond Switzerland alone.</li></ul><blockquote>This agreement puts Switzerland on an equal footing with the European Union and brings the tariff level down from 39 per cent to 15 per cent - Guy Parmelin</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States Trade Representative (USTR): USTR Jamieson Greer said the agreement tears down longstanding trade barriers, opens new markets for US goods and welcomed &#x27;massive Swiss investment to help reduce our deficit in pharmaceuticals and other key sectors&#x27; that will generate thousands of jobs across the US.
