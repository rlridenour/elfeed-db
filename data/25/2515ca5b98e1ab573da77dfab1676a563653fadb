<p>Firefox 89 changed right-click functionality on macOS. Previously, in a right click menu, typing a letter triggered an option in the menu. For example, rightclicking on a link and pressing <code>t</code> would open the link in a new tab.</p><p>But with the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/89.0/releasenotes/">June 1 release</a>, that is no longer the case. Now, pressing a letter highlights a menu item, but does not trigger it. It even highlights a different menu item from before. It is a side effect of using the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/89.0/releasenotes/#note-788671">native context menus</a> on macOS.</p><blockquote><p><b>Native context menus</b>: Context menus on macOS are now native and support Dark Mode.</p></blockquote><p>We can fix this by changing the about:config setting <code>widget.macos.native-context-menus</code> to true. Then Firefox uses its own context menus, so typing a letter triggers the menu item, as in previous browser versions.</p><p>Interestingly, this change was landed for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34572">a bug</a> reported a long time ago <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmzpdd4pWvM">in the year 2000</a>.</p>
