<blockquote><p>
A dentist spotted a deadbeat patient while dining at his country club one evening. He called the patient aside, reminded him that he owed him $250 for work done more than two years earlier, and insisted the man pay up. To the dentist&#8217;s astonishment, the patient pulled a checkbook from his pocket and wrote a check to the dentist for the full amount.</p>
<p>Skeptical about the patient&#8217;s good faith, the dentist went directly to the bank the next morning and presented the check for payment. The teller handed it back with the explanation that the patient&#8217;s account was a little short of the amount of the check. Following a few minutes of good-natured conversation the dentist learned that the man&#8217;s account was twenty-five dollars short of the needed amount. The dentist smiled, went to the customers&#8217; desk for a few minutes, came back to the teller, deposited thirty dollars to the account of the patient, and then again presented the check for $250 and walked out with a net gain of $220.
