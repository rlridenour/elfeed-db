<p>Operational Security (OPSEC) isn&#8217;t a military secret &#8211; it&#8217;s a survival tool.<br>People think it&#8217;s for soldiers, spies, or hackers.<br>But it&#8217;s for civilians. For you.<br>Every day, you leave trails: where you go, who you talk to, what you buy.<br>Someone is watching. Someone is connecting the dots.<br>OPSEC is the discipline of controlling your own story before someone else writes it for you.</p>
