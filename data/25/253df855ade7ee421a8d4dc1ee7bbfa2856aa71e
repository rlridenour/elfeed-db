<p>DuckDuckGo is a search engine. Like Google Search, you just throw some keywords into a box and get a list of results. Lots of people use Google, but I don&rsquo;t. DuckDuckGo works better for me, and this is why.</p>

## Consistent Results
<p>Did you know that Google will give you different search results, based on who you are and what you have searched for in the past? This is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter bubble</a>, and it&rsquo;s <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/google-filter-bubble-study/">annoying and dangerous</a>. DuckDuckGo doesn&rsquo;t put you in a filter bubble.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s incredible. It&rsquo;s simple. Perhaps best of all, ad-free! Well, they do display ads based on your search term for <em>just that search</em>. They don&rsquo;t track you. The ads are not customized to <em>you</em>, rather they are customized to your <em>search</em>. They&rsquo;re not intrusive either. I forgot they were there until I was typing this. 😄</p>
<p>But seriously. DuckDuckGo is amazing. Give it a try.</p>
<p>You can even enable it as your default search engine on iOS. Go to Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Search Engine and select DuckDuckGo. You can set it as well in Safari on desktop, as well as Firefox. (I don&rsquo;t use Chrome or Edge, though I imagine they&rsquo;d let you do the same. Comment below if you find anything out.</p>
