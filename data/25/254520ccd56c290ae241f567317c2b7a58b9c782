Although this is a previous generation device, it will work great for anyone who doesn't need the performance gains introduced with the newer Apple silicon chips, especially at this discounted price. Apple just announced the new M4 MacBook Air, and anyone shopping for those models can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/01/new-m4-macbook-air-50-discounts/">get up to &#36;60 off</a> a few configurations on Amazon.<br/>
