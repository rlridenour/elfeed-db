<p>Two projects involving philosophers were among those funded in the latest round.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Popular Government in Global Perspective: History, Principles, Institutions, and Experimentations<br />
</strong>(€9.2 million)</p>

<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><em>[Political systems often exhibit] “unequal responsiveness&#8221;, often tilting decisions in favour of the wealthy and special interest groups and this, the researchers say, has created widespread dissatisfaction. The project aims to counter this by uncovering alternative democratic models, which it groups under the label &#8220;popular government&#8221;. These are defined as political forms that genuinely seek to empower ordinary citizens, not just a select few. The study aims to break new ground by combining history, political philosophy, comparative politics and empirical research across five packages of work. Researchers will study historical, defeated democratic visions in India, South Africa, and Chile alongside existing or proposed elements of popular government around the world. These include mechanisms like citizens&#8217; assemblies, recall elections, and theoretical models like &#8220;lottocracy&#8221; (selection by lottery).

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>The Ethics of AI-Enabled Synthetic DNA<br />
</strong>(€5.8 million)</p>

<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><em>Should we use artificial intelligence to generate synthetic DNA? In the past, DNA was something that could&#8212;with difficulty&#8212;be modified, with fairly uncertain results. Now, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), it is possible to design DNA from scratch and &#8220;print&#8221; synthetic DNA sequences. Synthetic DNA can be used to create entirely new genetic sequences unrelated to the natural world and has been proposed as a strategy to preserve endangered species. It may also allow for the replication and reproduction of human genetic material in unprecedented ways&#8230; There are many questions regarding this technology that remain unanswered. The use of this technology forces us to reconsider fundamental questions about our relationship with nature. Who, if anyone, should have the right to design and create DNA? What restrictions should exist? These questions must be addressed, as the technology is already here.
