iOS 18.4 is the fourth major update to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> operating system that first came out last September, and it adds a long list of new features. Some features are limited to Apple's newer and more powerful <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, while others are available to all &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; users.<br/>
<br/>

This guide covers everything new in iOS 18.4.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="priority_notifications_-_apple_intelligence">Priority Notifications - Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
iOS 18.4 adds an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> Priority Notifications feature that shows you your most important notifications first. Priority Notifications is disabled by default, but it can be turned on by going to Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Prioritize Notifications and tapping the toggle.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991317" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/prioritize-notifications-ios-18-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Priority Notifications can also be set up on a per-app basis, with toggles available in the same sections of the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992532" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-prioritize-notifications.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
With the feature enabled, &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; will show notifications that may be important in a dedicated section at the top of the Lock Screen's notification center.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="visual_intelligence_for_iphone_15_pro_models">Visual Intelligence for iPhone 15 Pro Models</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/ios-18-4-visual-intelligence-iphone-15-pro/">is now available</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max, and it's no longer an option limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970984" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-Visual-Intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
<br/>
Since the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro and Pro Max do not have a Camera Control button, &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; can be activated via the Control Center or with the Action Button.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="visual_intelligence_action_button">Visual Intelligence Action Button</h2><br/>
Apple added an Action Button option that activates &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj;, and it can be used as an alternative to the Camera Control button for &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; on the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992533" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-visual-intelligence-action-button.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="control_center_apple_intelligence_section">Control Center Apple Intelligence Section</h2><br/>
In the Control Center, there's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-control-center/">an Apple Intelligence section</a>. It includes the Type to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> option that was in the now-removed &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; section, along with new options for activating &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and using &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992503" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-control-center-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="image_playground_sketch_style">Image Playground Sketch Style</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a> includes a Sketch style that joins the Animation and Illustration styles. Sketch was previously available for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-wand/">Image Wand</a>, but now it is a third style that can be used in &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991330" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-image-playground.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Swap styles by tapping on the "+" button in the &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; app. Apple also replaced the previous "Winter Holidays" theme with a new "Spring" theme.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_apple_intelligence_languages">New Apple Intelligence Languages</h2><br/>
French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified), along with localized English for Singapore and India.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_emoji">New Emoji</h2><br/>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992499" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18.4-Emoji-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="vision_pro_app">Vision Pro App</h2><br/>
If you have a Vision Pro headset, you'll <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/vision-pro-app-ios-18-4-beta-2/">see a Vision Pro app</a> on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; after installing iOS 18.4 if you have a Vision Pro headset. The Vision Pro app helps you discover and download content on the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992487" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/vision-pro-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
There are dedicated sections for Immersive Video, 3D movies, and more, with options to download apps directly to the Vision Pro without having to use the headset. Apple also added a dedicated My Vision Pro section with a user guide and tips for using the device.<br/>
<br/>
Guest setup can now be managed on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> linked to a Vision Pro, making it easier for Vision Pro owners to let others test their headset. There are controls for limiting what apps a guest is able to use, and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> mode for guiding the guest through Vision Pro experiences. When a guest user puts on the Vision Pro, a prompt to enable Guest Mode will appear on the headset owner's device.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_news+_food">Apple News+ Food</h2><br/>
For <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/">Apple News</a>+ subscribers, there's now an &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj; Food section. The Food section features tens of thousands of recipes, stories about restaurants, tips for healthy eating, kitchen essentials, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991301" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-food-news.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Content will come from top food publishers such as Allrecipes, Bon Appétit, Food & Wine, Good Food, and Serious Eats. &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj; editors will curate food-related stories, and there will be a dedicated Recipe Catalog section where new recipes are added regularly. An included cook mode provides step-by-step instructions, and users can save favorite recipes for offline access.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ambient_music">Ambient Music</h2><br/>
iOS 18.4 includes an Ambient Music option that can be added to Control Center. There are four different sound categories, including Sleep, Chill, Productivity, and Wellbeing.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991311" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-ambient-music.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Each category can be added to Control Center separately, and tapping one plays a random selection of sounds or music from that particular category. If you tap on the Ambient Music button that you added while in edit mode, you can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/27/ios-18-4-new-music-feature/">select different options</a> within each category.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Sleep Sounds, Bedtime Beats, Sound Bath, and Piano Sleep.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Chill:</strong> Piano Chill, Ambient Chill, Lo-Fi Jazz, and Pure Chill.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> BEATstrumentals, Binaural Frequencies, Pure Focus, and Classical Concentration.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Wellbeing:</strong> Pure Meditation, Spa, Beats & Breath, and Pure Calm.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
If you play Ambient Music and then tap into the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> at the top or access the Now Playing widget, you can skip songs and see the name of what's currently playing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="privacy_indication_dots">Privacy Indication Dots</h2><br/>
The small dots that show up on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s menu bar when the camera or microphone is in use have been moved to the left and are now more apparent thanks to a black background.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991331" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/new-siri-indicator-dot-ios-18-4.jpg" alt="" width="1134" height="182" /><br/>
<h2 id="siri_voices">Siri Voices</h2><br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="genmoji">Genmoji</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a> icon for the Emoji keyboard now says "&zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;" instead of just featuring a multi-colored smiley face. The change should make it more obvious where users go to create a &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; character.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991332" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-genmoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2><br/>
In the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app, there are new options to filter your library by images that were shared with you by others or by those that are not included in an album, which is useful for separating out content that you've organized into albums.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991598" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/photos-filters-ios-18-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992531" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-deleted-album.jpg" alt="" width="1918" height="997" /><br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="type_to_siri">Type to Siri</h2><br/>
When you use Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; a question, the keyboard is now collapsed down when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; answers. To type another request, you need to tap on the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; bar to bring it back up. There is also a toggle to activate Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; with the side button, which would normally cause &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to listen for a voice command.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991628" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-siri-accessibility-toggle.jpg" alt="" width="1811" height="1019" /><br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="app_store_review_summaries">App Store Review Summaries</h2><br/>
Apple now provides summaries of an app's customer reviews to get a quicker overview of what people think of it.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993504" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/app-store-review-summaries.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="pause_app_store_downloads">Pause App Store Downloads</h2><br/>
When you download an app from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, you can pause the download right from the update list in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rather than having to do it from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> icon for the app. Before now, you could only stop and restart an installation entirely from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, with no option for stopping it entirely.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992535" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ios-18-4-app-store-pause-download.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991600" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-password-countdown.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
