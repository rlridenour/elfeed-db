<p>Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s last shah, publicly appealed to European governments to take steps he says would help Iranian demonstrators bring down the Islamic Republic. In interviews, he argued the ruling system is close to collapse and framed himself as a potential figure for a post-regime transition, while acknowledging the immediate focus is supporting protests inside Iran. The reports also note the violence surrounding the unrest, including accounts of thousands killed during crackdowns, underscoring the stakes for Iranians and for foreign governments weighing how to respond.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/l-JsdfQzlmLPO9K3PKF6wd9O3lxfEoZ0TibU2S4f0NtLiLUyNSxc_HmoqqmnDGtW-abeLhVvq-jZ9iYhz3rJe7piXg_uzJDkaLr7uedFOQMTHitP59cBP5BNsBi_7yDmBngeu2D_j-wC9s0Hj5GIufybs0ob_6ohcMG1' alt='Reza Pahlavi, exiled son of Iran’s last shah, speaks as protests continue.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Targeted sanctions: Pahlavi urged the international community to specifically target the leadership of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a way to increase pressure on the state’s security apparatus.</li><li>Leadership claim: He said he is “uniquely positioned” to help lead a successor administration if the current system falls, a claim that has prompted questions about how broad his support is inside Iran and among opposition groups.</li><li>US posture: NDTV and Firstpost reported that President Donald Trump has so far held off on direct intervention in the unrest even as Pahlavi urges outside action.</li><li>Return pledge: Pahlavi publicly promised “I will return,” presenting himself as ready to go back to Iran if political conditions change.</li><li>Europe focus: He specifically asked European countries to take action in support of demonstrators, putting EU capitals at the center of his diplomatic outreach.</li></ul><blockquote>I will return - Reza Pahlavi</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Reza Pahlavi: He says Iran’s ruling system is on its “last legs” and is urging Europe and other governments to take actions that support demonstrators and hasten political change.
