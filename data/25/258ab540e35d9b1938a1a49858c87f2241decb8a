<p>While our country looks like it might be coming apart at the seams, it’s good to revisit, every once in a while, moments when it did work. And that’s not so that we can feel nostalgic about a lost time, but so that we can remind ourselves how, given the right conditions, things could work well once again.</p>
<p>One example from history (and recently rediscovered by a number of blogs during the AHCA debacle in Congress) is this government propaganda film from 1949—the Harry S. Truman era—that promotes the idea of cradle-to-grave health care, and all for three cents a week. This money went to school nurses, nutritionists, family doctors, and neighborhood health departments.</p>

<p>Directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Jones">Chuck Jones</a>, better known for animating Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, and the Road Runner, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiOzt57mfyA">“So Much for So Little”</a> follows our main character from infancy—where doctors help immunize babies against whooping cough, diphtheria, rheumatic fever, and smallpox—through school to dating, marriage, becoming parents, and settling into a nice, healthy retirement. Along the way, the government has made sure that health care is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>The film&nbsp;won an Academy Award in 1950 for Documentary Short Subject—not best sci-fi, despite how radical this all sounds.</p>
<p>So what happened? John Maher at the blog <em>Dot and Line</em> <a href="https://dotandline.net/ahca-vs-obamacare-so-much-for-so-little-chuck-jones-66e69ca916b2">puts it this way</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Partisanship and capitalism and racist zoning policies shattered its idealistic dream that Americans might actually pay communally for their health as well as that of their neighbors and fellow citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three cents per American per week wouldn’t cut it now in terms of universal health coverage. But according to Maher, quoting a 2009 Kingsepp study on the original Affordable Care Act, taxpayers would have to pay $3.61 a week.</p>
<p>So folks, don’t get despondent, get idealistic. The Greatest Generation came back from WWII with a grand idealism. Maybe this current generation just needs to fight and defeat Nazis all over again…</p>
