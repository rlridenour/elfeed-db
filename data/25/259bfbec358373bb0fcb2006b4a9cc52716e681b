**debugging my Planck keyboard
Intro Help please: GUOFF ?
I&rsquo;m using an unmodified Planck dropshipped keyboard. It is mostly as represented here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/refs/heads/master/keyboards/planck/keymaps/default/keymap.c with the exception that the lowest-left key is &lsquo;shift&rsquo; and not &lsquo;brite&rsquo;, although it would be nice if it were related to my keyboard backlight. See also https://config.qmk.fm/#/planck/rev7/LAYOUT_ortho_4x12, which seems to match except that both my spacebar buttons are, for now, really just space.
My toddler mashed some buttons for ten minutes before we realized where he was, and ever since then my GUI key is disabled.
