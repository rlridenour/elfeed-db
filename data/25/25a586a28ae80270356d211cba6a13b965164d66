AirPods Max were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/airpods-max/">first released in December 2020</a>, and the over-ear headphones have received minimal hardware changes since then.<br/>

Below, we recap when AirPods Max 2 are rumored to launch.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the new AirPods Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/kuo-lighter-version-airpods-max-2027/">will be lighter than the current ones</a>, but he did not mention a specific weight. The current AirPods Max weigh 0.85 pounds, excluding the charging case, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo expects the AirPods Max 2 to enter mass production at some point in 2027, but he did not provide any other details about the headphones.<br/>
<br/>
By the time the AirPods Max 2 launch in 2027, it will have been a seven-year wait for them. It is unclear what other changes they might have, beyond weighing less.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple updated the AirPods Max with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-announces-new-airpods-max/">USB-C charging port and new color options</a>, but they are still considered first-generation AirPods Max. The headphones <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/12/updated-airpods-max-are-disappointing/">did not receive Apple's H2 chip</a> that debuted in the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, so they continue to miss out on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airpods/">Adaptive Audio features</a>, and there were no other changes.<br/>
<br/>
AirPods Max still have the outdated H1 chip that Apple introduced in 2019, and yet the headphones continue to cost &#36;549 in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
AirPods Max with USB-C did gain <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/airpods-max-lossless-audio-coming-april/">support for lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio</a> in a firmware update released earlier this year.<br/>
