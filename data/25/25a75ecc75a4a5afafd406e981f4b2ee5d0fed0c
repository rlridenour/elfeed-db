<p>A collapse at the Rubaya coltan mine in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has killed more than 200 people, according to an official linked to the province’s rebel-appointed administration. Reports said the collapse happened earlier in the week, with some accounts describing people still trapped in the debris as rescue efforts continued. Rubaya is a major source of coltan—an ore processed into tantalum used in products such as mobile phones and computers—and the mine is described as supplying roughly 15% of the world’s coltan. Several outlets note the mine has been under the control of the M23 rebel group since 2024, and that the site relies heavily on manual digging by local workers for low pay, underscoring longstanding concerns about safety and oversight in the region’s mineral sector.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PiDQnyh1j8vRe8ZwVHqB5KZNw2UBpec5iYJ2yvnTwBuULw9AGVm46zgYlWj3n9Byaa2QtvZX4fDLyfydLHwzQqK0BSf3aBoQfZt6GpsiIb6FKCa9sBUgzhC_v_GAfIL_8sNfB2miPPZzTmHOZYdS0opcTYmZg2Z5cu4M6tZgO4QqunZDaBmRT2rkA6dWLKJ5yY66axa7UsRWEBHH-AzckT0FlgByxeSdVD_Akrr0RTx_PSkl8mTPmEDpTiE4Br0k-AbKJxiPe_l8ALX8cA' alt='Labourers at the coltan mine in the town of Rubaya in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in March, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Confirmed toll: An adviser cited by The Hindu put the confirmed death toll at at least 227, offering one of the more specific counts reported.</li><li>Mine governance: The official quoted by Reuters was identified as a spokesperson for the rebel-appointed governor of the province where Rubaya is located, highlighting the area’s contested administration.</li><li>Worker livelihoods: The Guardian reported local people dig manually at Rubaya for just a few dollars a day, a detail that points to economic pressure that can keep workers in risky sites.</li><li>Rights concerns: Al Jazeera noted that rights groups have previously raised concerns about conditions at the mine, adding scrutiny to the safety context around the collapse.</li><li>Global supply link: Because tantalum is valued for heat resistance and used in aerospace components and gas turbines as well as electronics, disruptions or reforms at Rubaya can echo beyond consumer tech supply chains.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Rebel-appointed provincial administration: A spokesperson for the rebel-appointed governor said more than 200 people died in the collapse at Rubaya.
