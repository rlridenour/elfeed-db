getmail -rmymail.conf File &ldquo;/usr/bin/getmail&rdquo;, line 64 except ImportError, o: ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
 It turns out, the service I use to collect my email, getmail, requires python 2; I&rsquo;d forgotten this (if I ever knew it) and made python 3 my system default (I rebound the &ldquo;python&rdquo; command to 3 instead of 2) and so it failed. I didn&rsquo;t realize this until 16 hours later wondering why I wasn&rsquo;t getting my mail, and digging into my scripts, evaluating line by line, I finally got the above error.
