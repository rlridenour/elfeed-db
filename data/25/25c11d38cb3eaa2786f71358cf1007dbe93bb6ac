<li>Cool little cars that can do flips and spins and stuff</li>
<li>Keychains attached</li>
<li>They light up</li>
<li>Clear balls for them to do tricks in</li>
<li>Are they available in Georgia Red: The red one has a yellow accent so I’m sorry, that’s Iowa State</li>
</ul><h1>Easy, Stupid, Giftable</h1><p>Hey, it’s me. The young child in your life.</p>
<p>Look, this time of year can seem fraught. I get that. The holidays are important for kids, and you want to make it <em>extra</em> special. That’s so sweet. But you really need to remember who you’re dealing with here.</p>
<p>Let me remind you of some of my tastes.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I have two favorite toys. One of which is the little figurine version of my favorite character from my favorite cartoon show. The other one? It’s a tiny knock-off GI-Joe-like guy manufactured sometime between 1985 and 1999 that I found in a box in the attic at grandma and grandpa’s house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are about a month removed from a holiday during which I acquired and happily ate my weight in candies that are basically sugar cubes with citric acid added to them. In a couple days, I’m going to turn up my nose at a delicious bowl of homemade cranberry relish in favor of the quote-unquote sauce that still retains the shape of the can it came in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My favorite brand of pants is red. My favorite brand of shoes is velcro. My favorite brand of coat is shiny. My favorite movie is a user-made video featuring <em>Paw Patrol</em> click art moving around the screen and text-to-talk digital voices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All I’m saying is, I’m about three to five years removed from being a nightmare who worries about the status certain brand names carry. But this year, my Christmas list includes a pony, a hoverboard (but, like, one that <em>really</em> hovers), and then the toys from the last three ads I saw before writing it.</p>
<p>In other words: this holiday, I’m looking for quantity over quality.</p>
<p>And so, when I unwrap these USA Toyz Whipz Micro Racers, I’m not going to scoff at packaging that features not one but two z-for-s substitutions. I’m not going to ask you why the cars themselves look like computer mice from the early aughts. What I’m going to see is: whoa! Keychain-size cars! And balls! What???</p>
<p>Might your insistence on flooding the area of floor beneath the Christmas tree with junk from a deal site result in issues later on, when I come to understand just how little you spent on my gifts? Sure. But that’s something adult me can work out with a therapist.</p>
<p>For now, keep the presents coming, whatever they are!</p>
