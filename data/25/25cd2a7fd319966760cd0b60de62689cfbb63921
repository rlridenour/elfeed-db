With the sixth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, Apple has added several new ringtones that are alternatives to the classic "Reflection" ringtone. Reflection is the ringtone that Apple has long used as the default on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>

In addition to the standard Reflection ringtone, there are now six variants: Buoyant, Dreamer, Tech, Pop, Reflected, and Surge.<br/>
<br/>
Reflected is identical to the "Alt 1" ringtone option that was added back in the second beta of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The classic Reflection ringtone is still the default, so if you prefer one of the new sounds, you'll need to set it manually. Apple also added a new ringtone called Little Bird, which is distinct from the new Reflection options. You can listen to all the new ringtones below. <br/>

You can get to the new ringtones in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; by opening up Sounds and Haptics in the Settings app, tapping on Ringtone, tapping on Reflection, and then selecting one of the alternates. <br/>
