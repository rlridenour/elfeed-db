This appears to be a record-breaking sale price for an original iPod at auction, with the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2023/08/03/original-ipod-sealed-sold-rally/70518816007/">previous known record being &#36;29,000</a> in 2023.

<br/>
Introduced by Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2001/10/23Apple-Presents-iPod/">in October 2001</a>, the iPod helped Apple to become successful again, after it flirted with bankruptcy in the late 1990s.<br/>
<br/>
Jobs famously pitched the iPod as offering "1,000 songs in your pocket," and he unveiled the device by pulling it out of his own pocket.<br/>
<br/>
"With iPod, Apple has invented a whole new category of digital music player that lets you put your entire music collection in your pocket and listen to it wherever you go," he said. "With iPod, listening to music will never be the same again."<br/>
