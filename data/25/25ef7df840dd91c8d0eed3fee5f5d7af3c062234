<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday, with Iran diplomacy at the top of the agenda as US-Iran nuclear talks enter what several outlets describe as a critical stage. Netanyahu is expected to push Washington toward a tougher approach to Tehran and to seek terms that address broader security concerns alongside the nuclear file. Iran, for its part, has warned the United States not to let Netanyahu derail the negotiations, highlighting how high the stakes are for both sides as the meeting nears. Even with the tensions, diplomacy is still moving—and the face-to-face meeting keeps a path open to dial down escalation if negotiators can narrow long-standing gaps.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gkvkoicqmeRY2FGMyYXzXQ6GFOBiwOPpiNPN-7rRbW9VY5FZkeT79VyunsqcNeAkRmYoWCousrgOyayfl7O9jLxWbOsYSk7e1hpNTb-Sgc_FK_oFS9gmu9VXqY4nb__QFv-sO22QoeWqSF4r2KZxKFfXnZXSnmhs5eaKWEVehyov1bSy3fSUMCvYtIz_CoQmtYB--mTAjznzy3JhAm4G6S1f4Fs_qYXg6tHH6N9mpjqzw-DJ0lJvVyNsX0axh3qPZFn36fIn4Irm_D4kNB3WgAq1' alt='A meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu comes as US-Iran nuclear negotiations intensify.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Broader conditions list: Netanyahu may argue the talks should cover more than the nuclear issue, including ballistic missiles, Iran’s support for regional proxy forces, and other non-nuclear concerns.</li><li>Military contingency: The leaders may also discuss potential military action if US-Iran diplomacy fails.</li><li>Timing shift: Netanyahu’s visit was moved forward as US-Iran talks progressed.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Iran: Tehran warned Washington not to let Netanyahu “thwart” the nuclear talks, saying Israel is trying to add conditions that could sink a deal—such as demands tied to missiles, Iran’s regional proxies, and other issues beyond the nuclear file.
