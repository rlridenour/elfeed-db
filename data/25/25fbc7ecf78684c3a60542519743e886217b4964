<p>US President Donald Trump warned that American economic support for Argentina, including a planned $20 billion lifeline, depends on President Javier Milei winning this month’s legislative midterms, saying, “If (Milei) wins we are staying with him, and if he doesn&#x27;t win we are gone” [france24.com#1][nytimes.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][theguardian.com#1][bbc.com#1]. The two leaders met at the White House on Tuesday as Washington moves to finalize a package described as a currency swap to bolster the peso and calm market volatility ahead of the vote [nytimes.com#1][semafor.com#1][dw.com#1][firstpost.com#1]. Trump framed the aid as support for Milei’s economic philosophy and said the US would not be “generous” if Milei’s coalition loses [theglobeandmail.com#1][scmp.com#1][theguardian.com#1][bbc.com#1]. Argentina’s legislative elections on October 26 will determine whether Milei retains a mandate to pursue his cost-cutting agenda [elpais.com#1][semafor.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DSijPNq8wFwO3yHlGCtL6wY79EwNox1PaqkCGqhC7fYlY3-i1lnxbDG1iEO-MtF0wsUta9gLwM08-Ld8WT98RldTjIIkaSjWsjrfSQxl_Pb1qGpc841HghVrFg9IpP2mLhvtylTK90PUzkdPi-VGlOXHPwt-zCWSsC4fD-dEajQ-0WKGI8VoUg' alt='President Trump with Argentina’s President Javier Milei outside the White House on Tuesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Aid structure: US support is described as a $20 billion lifeline taking the form of a currency swap to stabilize the peso and ease volatility [semafor.com#1][elpais.com#1][dw.com#1].</li><li>Conditional backing: Trump said the US &quot;will not be generous&quot; and &quot;we are gone&quot; if Milei loses the midterms later this month [theguardian.com#1][bbc.com#1][france24.com#1].</li><li>Election stakes: The October 26 legislative elections will shape Milei’s ability to advance his agenda in Congress [elpais.com#1][semafor.com#1].</li><li>White House meeting: Milei visited the White House on Tuesday to seek political and economic support as Trump publicly reaffirmed his backing [firstpost.com#1][nytimes.com#1][theguardian.com#1].</li><li>Unusual step: Semafor called the move a rare, direct foreign intervention intended to calm markets before the vote, looming over IMF and World Bank meetings [semafor.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>If (Milei) wins we are staying with him, and if he doesn&#x27;t win we are gone. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He tied future US aid to Milei’s success, saying Washington would not be &quot;generous&quot; or &quot;waste our time&quot; if Milei’s coalition loses.
