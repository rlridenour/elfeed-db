</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
I can think of no better time than that between Winter Solstice and New Year’s Day.

Myth is a tear in the fabric of reality, and immense energies pour
through these holy fissures.  Our stories, our poems, are rips in this
fabric as well, however slight.

<p>Yule-tide, the twelve days between Winter Solstice and New Year’s Day.  <time datetime="2025" title="2025">This
year</time> those days coincide with my (paid) time off of work.</p>
<p>I stumbled a bit, thinking what the common weekday name I would give <time datetime="2025-12-30" title="2025-12-30">today</time>.  It
felt very much like Sunday.  Much as <time datetime="2025-12-29" title="2025-12-29">yesterday</time> did.  Perhaps there’s that sense
of holiness that burns through these yule-lit days.</p>
<p>Not holy as we might conflate with communion and sermons, but in those fissures.
In which a true light shines through, that of communal memory and myths
constructed around firelight.</p>
<p>I think to those gatherings at Grandma and Grandpa Friesen’s house.  We’d be
there together for what felt like several days.  Time made little sense, as the
15 of us stuffed into that small ranch house in Nebraska.  Laughter tumbling
amidst Low German and English.</p>
<p>The younger cousins and I would play at grandpa’s pool table.  Endless hours in
those pre-electronic entertainment console days.  Later I’d learn that it was a
shoddy thing, warped and uneven.  But in those days, the green felt felt
enchantingly rich.</p>
<p>In later years, there were those days in which we’d pack up after Christmas and
drive to Vermont.  Late nights of laughter as we’d play fishbowl around the
hearth.  Yule-tide, is for gathering.  For catching glimpses of the sun’s
return.  Sharing in that joy of togetherness, when the world outside, at this
latitude at least, is grinding ice and howling wind.</p>
<p>Now, I gather with Jenny and our dogs Lacey and Ollie.  Me writing (poetry and
Lisp, as though there were a difference) and Jenny reading.  Lacey curled up
beside Jenny and Ollie wedged into his lounging chair.  We’ll go outside for a
bit, and stomp through the fresh powder of yesterday.</p>
<p>But Yule-tide is now a fragile thing, at least in these States of America.  Each
year, I claim some of my employer benefits: paid time off.  Yet not all of my
children have benefits that provide paid time off.  Others must budget time off
for visiting their fractured families.</p>
<p>Where is the sacred?</p>
<p>I want to write “sacrificed to the maw of capitalism”, but that is an
indirection.  Capitalists, lets name them not their system, demand our time and
talent to extract and enrich themselves.  The sacred, cultural memories and
echoes, is something to be shattered, rended, and in their flattening-mind,
forgotten and/or perverted.  Replaced with consumption.</p>
<p class="verse">
Yule-tide, yule-tide, a wave of night<br />
passing through mists of time<br />
waxing toward growing light.<br />
<br />
This yule-tide let pop the cork<br />
and decant drought of warding warmth,<br />
and celebrate family and friends<br />
and home and hearth.<br />
