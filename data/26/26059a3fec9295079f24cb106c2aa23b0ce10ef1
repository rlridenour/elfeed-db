<p>President Trump announced on Thanksgiving that his administration will work to &quot;permanently pause&quot; migration to the United States from what he called &quot;all Third World Countries,&quot; following a shooting near the White House that killed one National Guard member and critically injured another. He linked the plan to the suspect&#x27;s background, saying investigators believe the attack was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 under a resettlement program approved during President Biden&#x27;s term. In a series of late-night posts on his Truth Social platform, Trump also said he would seek to end federal benefits and subsidies for &quot;non-citizens,&quot; revoke admissions granted under Biden-era immigration policies, and remove anyone he deemed &quot;not a net asset&quot; to the United States. The declarations signal a significant escalation of his administration&#x27;s immigration agenda but did not include legal details, timelines, or a list of affected countries, leaving major questions about implementation, international relations, and impacts on existing migrants.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/1TM3fks9GlInrwE1UbjZhV4aJGlro9Td6UWzSUZZOrPZasaTD_bBwqIrf3JVPfwQqI1TwxAPXD7SSDuxYncLJnQcdnoHIO_wiGCWrregCi4iHlVcukjj_HV5Li_RPgPCcUAnFJ72aPTbYKks6VWjT7hkCBZs7KlhH-Tj2UVE1uKwGQyrpl9ztssVYGjB1VeSLuCk-Pfmp6tWwqUxb6ztZEQcK_dl8QTR4gsjTnt2a7Vdu-J9l2UHp-03v7x2Tisvugtb7FKTgGOqLEKdew' alt='President Donald Trump speaks with US military personnel via video link from Mar-a-Lago on Thanksgiving, shortly before or after posting about plans to pause migration from &quot;Third World Countries.&quot;' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Policy scope: Trump said the pause would apply to all migrants from &quot;Third World Countries,&quot; including people already approved under former President Biden&#x27;s resettlement and admission programs.</li><li>Additional measures: His posts called for &quot;reverse migration&quot; to remove certain immigrants, denaturalisation of migrants who &quot;undermine domestic tranquillity,&quot; and deportation of any foreign national deemed a public charge or security risk.</li><li>Afghan cases halted: US officials had already stopped processing immigration requests from Afghan nationals a day before the announcement, after the National Guard shooting near the White House.</li><li>Rhetoric on countries: Trump described the targeted nations as &quot;failed&quot; or &quot;Third World&quot; and argued that refugee and migrant arrivals were a leading source of social strain in the United States.</li><li>Institutional follow-up: The Department of Homeland Security has been ordered to conduct a wide-ranging review of asylum cases and other admissions approved under the Biden administration, focusing on security vetting.</li></ul><blockquote>I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Trump argued that &quot;unchecked migration&quot; has weakened US society and strained national resources and said the country needs time &quot;to fully recover&quot; from what he called an immigration &quot;onslaught.&quot;.
