<div>  <p>I recently wanted to develop some Emacs code. But I didn't want to do the work of finding all the different dependencies needed to install them.</p>  <p>I'm running NixOS, so luckily, there is a command for that.</p>  <pre><code class="code-shell">nix develop nixpkgs#emacs</code></pre>  <p><a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-develop.html"><code>nix develop</code></a> will open a shell with all the dependencies needed to develop that package.</p>  <p>This is a flake-based command, so I believe it needs to be building a flake.</p>  <p>As above, you need to specify that the package is inside <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs"><code>nixpkgs</code></a> if you're trying to use one from there. Do that with <code>nixpkgs#your-package-here</code>. You can presumably develop flakes from elsewhere by specifying different locations.</p>  <p>After running the command, I was able to build Emacs without having to install a single dependency! Thanks, Nix!</p></div>
