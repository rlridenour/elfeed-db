YouTube has started testing a new two-person Premium subscription tier in some countries, offering a more affordable option for pairs of users who want ad-free viewing without committing to a full family plan (via <em><a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/youtube-pilots-two-person-premium-plan-to-boost-its-subscription-push-article-13012813.html">Money Control</a></em>).<br/>

The pilot program is currently limited to India, France, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, with no immediate word on whether the tier will expand to other regions like the United States.<br/>

"We're experimenting with new ways to provide greater flexibility and value to our YouTube Premium subscribers, including offering a two-person Premium plan option, allowing two people to share a subscription at a reduced cost," a YouTube spokesperson confirmed in a statement to <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/youtube-is-testing-a-discounted-two-person-premium-subscription-tier/">TechCrunch</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
Similar to Spotify's Duo plan, the new tier is designed for two people living at the same address who want Premium benefits such as ad-free viewing and background play.<br/>
<br/>
The test appears to be part of YouTube's efforts to diversify its subscription offerings and potentially recover subscribers who may have canceled after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/youtube-tv-gets-major-price-hike/">recent price increases</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The test follows YouTube's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/youtube-premium-lite-ad-free-tier-launch-us/">March rollout of Premium Lite</a>, a lower-cost tier that offers ad-free viewing without YouTube Music access or certain other Premium features. The Lite plan is currently available in the United States, Australia, Germany, and Thailand.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/">YouTube</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/youtube-two-person-premium-subscription-plan/">YouTube Tests New Two-Person Premium Subscription Plan</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-tests-new-two-person-premium-subscription-plan.2456577/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
