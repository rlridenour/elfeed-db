Startup accelerator and venture capital firm Y Combinator (YC) today filed an amicus brief supporting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> in Epic's continued legal fight with Apple. Y Combinator says that Apple's "anti-steering restraints" have long inhibited the growth and development of technology companies that monetize goods and services through apps.<br/>

The company calls on the court to deny Apple's appeal and uphold the order that required Apple to change its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> linking rules in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-anti-steering-injunction-violation/">Back in April</a>, Apple was found to be violating a 2021 injunction that required it to let developers direct customers to third-party purchase options on the web using in-app links. Apple had implemented a system for developers to link to external websites in their apps, but it charged an up to 27 percent fee to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was found to be in "willful violation" of the anti-steering injunction, and it was ordered to allow developers to freely link to purchase options outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; with no fees or restrictions on link format. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-updates-u-s-app-review-guidelines-epic/">implemented those changes</a>, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-appeals-app-store-payment-rule-changes/">also filed an appeal</a>, so there is potential for the decision to be walked back. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; and now Y Combinator are aiming to prevent Apple from being able to revert to its old &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules around linking.<br/>
<br/>
Y Combinator says that it has "long been hesitant" to support app-based businesses subject to "the Apple Tax" because they were poor investments.<br/>
<blockquote>A 30% revenue share can easily be the difference between a company that can afford to scale, hire new employees, and reinvest in its product, and one that is perpetually struggling to stay afloat. Understood in this light, the 30% Apple Tax protected from erosion by Apple's anti-steering restraints is not merely a cost of doing business, it is a profound and often insurmountable barrier to entry that stifles competition and innovation at its source.</blockquote><br/>
The enforcement order that's currently in place has already created renewed investor interest in app-based business models that were previously not feasible, according to Y Combinator. The company believes that Apple adds minimal value for the fees that it collects.<br/>
<br/>
Y Combinator suggests that the court end Apple's anti-steering restraints permanently to promote innovation and to allow tech startups to freely compete.<br/>
