<p id="p2">Audio Hijack&rsquo;s tagline is short and sweet: Record any audio. Save audio from any app, any device, or even from your entire system. Record podcasts, capture streaming audio, archive audio calls, or grab sounds from games and videos. If it makes sound on your Mac, <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack?utm_source=macstories&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=STORIES-2512" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audio Hijack</a> can record it.</p>
<p id="p3">There&rsquo;s so much more. Use the built-in Transcribe block for local, secure transcription of audio without relying on any cloud services. Schedule recordings for live broadcasts you don&rsquo;t want to miss. Even use it to create your own live streams.</p>
