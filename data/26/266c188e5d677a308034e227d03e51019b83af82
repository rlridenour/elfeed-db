Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.3.2, a week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-releases-ios-18-4/">releasing the iOS 18.4 update</a>. Now that iOS 18.3.2 is not being signed, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.4 are not able to downgrade to a version of iOS 18.3.<br/>

It is typical for Apple to stop signing an older version of iOS after releasing an update, and the process keeps &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users from installing outdated versions of iOS. "Signing" refers to a server-side verification check that's done when versions of iOS are downloaded onto an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Only software that passes the verification check is able to be installed.<br/>

Preventing downgrading ensures that customers have the latest security improvements and are not vulnerable to known attacks or security holes.<br/>
