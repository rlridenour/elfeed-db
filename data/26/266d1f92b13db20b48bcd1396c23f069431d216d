<p>A US federal immigration agent shot a Venezuelan man in the leg during a Wednesday evening enforcement operation in north Minneapolis, authorities and multiple outlets reported. US Department of Homeland Security officials said the agent fired in self-defence after being attacked with a shovel and a broom handle while trying to make an arrest, and they described the man’s injuries as non-life-threatening. The incident came about a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot a local woman, Renee Good, in the same city, a case that has helped drive protests and sharpened a political clash between Minnesota leaders and the Trump administration over immigration enforcement.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/sXv-LyqhqAfuiX3TPc6jNWGXyQMBRLmchWTnKhUGlAH_XX5mFRB_fMjoQtjGTRjsU0xon41H0cRdwa_EYrZ3XeUkXDDI3-htbOXX7bRAjb0Vbs5Yd3dc93oFxWMEEdlV-EdBU8CMG-C2SIxq8WcQq7aD1kU0LBHT44q67ZQIz_SbMtZRGmqDHgFcBnD6ZGq32Qs5eqaXVUloYk8CMXgcjuaeWovnww9Ps1FIbw16c9hbwlwEBwVU48n7oewERJ9UdkwoK6IfAPb1PQanSw' alt='Federal immigration officers at the scene of a reported shooting Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026, in Minneapolis.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Crowd response: Several hundred protesters gathered near the scene and federal agents used smoke and other crowd-control measures as they blocked off the area, according to witness reporting.</li><li>Official account: DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the shooting followed a targeted traffic stop shortly before 7pm local time after the man fled in his vehicle and crashed into a parked car.</li><li>City leadership: Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called the situation “not sustainable,” as the city faces repeated unrest tied to immigration enforcement actions.</li><li>Enforcement surge: Reporting described the shooting as linked to an ICE surge in the area, with political leaders trading blame as tensions rise.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Department of Homeland Security: Officials said the agent fired a defensive shot after an ambush-style attack with a shovel and broom handle, and they characterized the injury as non-life-threatening.
