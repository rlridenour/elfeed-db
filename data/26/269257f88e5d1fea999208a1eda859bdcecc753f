<a href="https://www.colorware.com">ColorWare</a> is known for making custom-painted Apple products and accessories, and it is essentially the only company that offers non-standard colors for AirPods, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, and other Apple accessories.<br/>

In addition to letting you order custom AirPods in <a href="https://www.colorware.com/collections/apple">a wide range of colors</a>, ColorWare often comes up with fun special edition products. This February, ColorWare debuted its ColorWare Retro Collection with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> that have a unique design.<br/>

The Retro &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 and &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; come in a matte cream color ColorWare is calling "Light Mode," and a matte black "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a>" shade. Both models feature colorful rainbow accents that harken back to the rainbow colors that Apple used for some of its original Macs.<br/>
<br/>
The Retro &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 are priced at &#36;499, and the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; with ANC are priced at &#36;439, so there is a premium for a custom design, but it's worth it if you want a look you can't get elsewhere. ColorWare uses a proprietary painting process to ensure the finish will hold up over time, and it's been customizing devices for more than a decade.<br/>

ColorWare uses a multi-step coating process that includes a primer, the application of a proprietary color formula, and an X2 liquid plastic coating that protects the color, with all products warrantied for 12 months.<br/>
