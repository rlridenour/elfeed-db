<blockquote>
  <p>Oracle Corp. is in discussions with Skydance Media LLC for a major
software deal once the media company’s acquisition of Paramount
Global is complete. The new arrangement is expected to be worth
about $100 million per year, according to people familiar with the
matter who asked not to be named speaking about the private
discussions. The agreement would see Paramount and its
subsidiaries using Oracle’s cloud software, the people said.</p>

<p>Skydance was founded by David Ellison, the son of Oracle Chairman
Larry Ellison.</p>
