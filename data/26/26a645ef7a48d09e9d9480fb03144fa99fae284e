  <p>“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said. “I
said to him, ‘my friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming
here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over
India.’ I don’t want you building in India.”</p>

<p>Trump was referencing Apple’s commitment of a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/apple-to-open-texas-ai-server-factory-in-500-billion-us-expansion.html">$500 billion
investment</a> in the U.S. which was announced in February.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And which would have <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/24/apple-500-billion-american-manufacturing-plan">almost certainly been the same thing they would have announced</a> if Kamala Harris had won the election. They announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-commits-430-billion-in-us-investments-over-five-years/">a $430 billion US investment in 2021</a>, in the first year of the Biden administration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has been ramping up production in India with the aim of
making around 25% of global iPhones in the country in the next few
years, as it looks to reduce reliance on China, where around 90%
of its flagship smartphone is currently assembled.</p>

<p>“I said to Tim, I said, ‘Tim look, we treated you really good, we
put up with all the plants that you build in China for years, now
you got build us [<em>sic</em>]. We’re not interested in you building in India,
India can take care of themselves ... we want you to build here,’”
Trump said.</p>

<p>The U.S. president added that Apple is going to be “upping” its
production in the United States, without disclosing further
details.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Apple were to assemble a single iPhone in the United States, that would be upping its US iPhone production, which, since the original iPhone in 2007, is at zero. It’s not a matter of willpower or spending — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/09/trump-think-us-has-resources-to-make-iphones">it just isn’t possible</a> at anything even vaguely approaching the iPhone’s scale.</p>
