<p>There is peace in boundaries<br>
In knowing that beyond certain fences<br>
Lie lands that make wild promises<br>
But sow seeds of devastation</p>
<p>There is wisdom in boundaries<br>
In knowing that some restrictions heal<br>
While others oppress, and that<br>
I can know the difference between them</p>
<p>There is joy in boundaries<br>
In knowing that while I long to be free<br>
True freedom requires restraint<br>
And so, smiling, I dance toward the light</p>

<p>Everything we say <em>yes</em> to implies a <em>no</em> to something else (or at least a <em>not yet</em>). The latter are the boundaries that protect our time as well as our physical, emotional, and mental wellbeing.</p>
