<p>My thanks to <a href="https://whispertype.com">WhisperType</a>​ for sponsoring Six Colors this week.</p>
<p>WhisperType brings high-quality speech-to-text transcription to the Mac with a clever twist: It’s designed for people who love using the keyboard. You can start or stop dictation with a hotkey, and once your words are transcribed, you get full control to navigate, edit, and format using just your keyboard. No awkward mouse-clicking or hunting for buttons.</p>
<p>It’s built on Whisper, the open-source transcription engine from OpenAI, so the accuracy is seriously impressive, even in less-than-ideal environments. While WhisperType uses cloud processing for transcription, your files are deleted immediately after returning the result, maintaining your privacy and security. You can even set up custom spelling for unusual words you use all the time, such as the names of people or products.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever wished macOS dictation was just a little smarter, or if you’ve avoided voice tools because they didn’t feel built for you, WhisperType is worth a look. It’s fast and feels right at home on a Mac. You can learn more and download a free trial at <a href="https://whispertype.com">WhisperType.com</a>.</p>
