In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-12/inside-apple-s-glasses-pivot-when-apple-is-launching-m5-macbook-pro-ipad-pro"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said he was told a future version of Apple's smart glasses may be able to run a full version of the visionOS operating system when they are paired with a Mac, and then switch to a more lightweight, mobile-friendly interface when they are paired with an iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's smart glasses <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/04/apple-smart-glasses-launch-timeframe/">would compete with the Meta Ray-Bans</a>, which are now available with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/18/meta-launches-ai-glasses/">an in-lens display</a> (pricing starts at &#36;799 in the United States). However, Gurman previously said Apple's first version of smart glasses will not offer an in-lens display.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's first smart glasses will have speakers for music playback, cameras for photos and video, voice control, and potentially health features, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
He previously said Apple may announce the first-generation glasses <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/01/apple-ai-smart-glasses-focus/">as early as 2026</a>, ahead of a 2027 launch.<br/>
