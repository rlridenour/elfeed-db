<p>Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. delegations met in Abu Dhabi for a second round of U.S.-brokered technical talks aimed at ending the nearly four-year war, with Kyiv calling the first day “substantive and productive” and saying the agenda centers on military issues. The United Arab Emirates is hosting the two-day meetings as Washington pushes for a path toward a ceasefire and a broader settlement. Any optimism is tempered by continued fighting and hard positions. Several outlets say Russia has not softened demands that Ukraine considers unacceptable, while Moscow has publicly insisted Kyiv must accept Russian conditions or Russia will keep fighting. In Kyiv, residents voiced skepticism as strikes continued, and President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of using a U.S.-backed energy truce to stockpile weapons ahead of a record wave of ballistic missile attacks. Even so, the fact that all sides returned to the table—and are working through practical, military “technical” steps—still leaves room for incremental progress, such as limited pauses that could reduce harm to civilians, especially in winter.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/-KB700NlOlyFCZed9GOXacQ8Azw15Nzo1sGkSAwXNe-0lLiKm9hF0C8MsGP87iH69fA6ZfFmppeaCrwjUvQUuqRGLyBMSCk4l0aGCMrfP3Xt_rv5vHO5geUVzUR2E4rl1arbJ-SWCF2xaKAtuwgm8ThpumSP3B8qNgGGX0C41ryGhB0jimMX4DAv-w4bbnxLd22403LqUWKuyymO4YtjkqsRMWn7xdMbJyCQOT5DVVftvmllwdrlTDrddVO58YosGzOR2IJDY7O1ObJtlVs' alt='Members of the US, Russian and Ukrainian delegations attend trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi on Feb. 4, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Freeze proposal: Ukraine says it supports freezing the conflict along the current front line and rejects any unilateral pullback of its forces.</li><li>Market attack: A Russian strike using cluster munitions killed seven people at a market in Ukraine, a reminder of the risks to civilians even as talks continue.</li><li>Energy grid strain: As negotiations continued, Russian strikes were reported to have severely disrupted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and power supply during harsh winter conditions.</li><li>No territorial concessions: Ukraine has warned that ceding ground would embolden Moscow and says it will not sign an agreement that fails to deter a future Russian invasion.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine (negotiating team): Kyiv says the Abu Dhabi meetings are technical talks focused on military issues and “practical solutions,” and Zelenskyy says he expects the negotiations to soon lead to another prisoner exchange.
