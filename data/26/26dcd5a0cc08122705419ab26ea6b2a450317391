</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
When offline and online reading collide, I take note.  This time a bit about Socrates, Turing, and Orwell.
</p>
        <blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="it-is-that-disregard-of-truth-that-phoniness-that-makes-them-unstable">
<p>
It is that disregard of truth, that phoniness, that makes [Authoritarian
regimes] inherently unstable.

<p>I just read <a href="https://netwert.com/ideapad/2025/08/04/the-impossibility-of-comprehending-ai/">The impossibility of comprehending AI</a>, with a quote from <a href="https://www.todayintabs.com/p/we-need-to-talk-about-sloppers-b732">Rusty
Foster</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humanity has never before experienced coherent language without any cognition
driving it. In regular life, we have never been required to distinguish between
“language” and “thought” because only thought was capable of producing language,
in any but the most trivial sense. The two are so closely welded that even a
genius like Alan Turing couldn’t conceive of convincing human language being
anything besides a direct proxy for “intelligence.” … Very few of us have been
inoculated with a theory of mind that distinguishes language from thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my read of <cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite> by Agnes Callard, she made mention of the Turing Test.  And explained how Socrates might
construct a test to fool us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Socrates will require that the computer fool us in a specific way: by playing
either the role of [William] James, or the role off [William] Clifford, well
enough to help us inquire into some untimely question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where William James is inquiring to seek truth and William Clifford is refuting
to avoid error.  That is I might inquire while the <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr> refutes; or vice versa.
Given that these <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLMs</abbr> fabricate truth, flatter, and grovel, they are
ill-equipped to pursue knowledge.</p>
<p>Thinking more on this, an <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLMs</abbr> output is shaped in part by its handlers.  And
with that constraint, the language output could be construed as propaganda.
Which is perhaps highlights a possible course of inoculation…that is read more
Orwell, and other refutations of propaganda.</p>
