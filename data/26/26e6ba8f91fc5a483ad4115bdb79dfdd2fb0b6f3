<p>An anti-corruption probe has uncovered a roughly $100 million kickback scheme tied to Ukraine&#x27;s energy sector that implicated close associates of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, prompting sanctions and the dismissal of senior officials. Kyiv&#x27;s independent anti-graft agencies led the investigation, and officials say the revelations have raised fresh concerns among Western partners about transparency in how international aid is used. In response, Zelenskyy imposed sanctions on a former business partner and removed several ministers, actions Kyiv presents as accountability measures while allies demand concrete anti-corruption commitments before further financial support. Analysts warn the scandal could complicate Ukraine&#x27;s ability to attract outside aid at a time of fiscal strain, with officials in Brussels seeking reassurances on future spending.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/rtlT4vlq8rMFBmOilRRoGWkCPjr3YJ-Z2s9791wcH59Of0NCP8kN2LZP6siOSAYRotnIlpc1H8rH23mVFICHkqZ24SrlDbRh4D9rsGTzEQhDRMLZdqRB1JLdkqRtAtaBHqCha7Ggfp0rphPAAzH2YD_dM_SI0CA' alt='President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced sanctions after an energy-sector kickback probe implicated a former associate' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of losses: Investigators say about $100 million was siphoned from energy-sector contracts, a sum that officials warn could have weakened state resources during wartime</li><li>Watchdog independence: Several EU diplomats called the probe a sign that Ukraine&#x27;s anti-corruption bodies are operating independently, even as they pressed Kyiv for concrete reforms to satisfy partners</li><li>Nuclear sector scrutiny: Reporting indicates the investigation touches the state-owned nuclear power company, placing additional operational and reputational pressure on a critical part of Ukraine&#x27;s energy system</li><li>Budget pressure: Officials warn the revelations arrive as Kyiv faces a projected €41 billion budget shortfall next year and stalled talks over a €140 billion reparations loan from frozen Russian assets</li></ul><blockquote>We expect Ukraine to press ahead with anti-corruption measures and reforms in its own country - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Union (diplomats): Some EU officials said the probe is a positive sign of watchdog independence but warned Ukraine must give more transparency about how it spends aid.
