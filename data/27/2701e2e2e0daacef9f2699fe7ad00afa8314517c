Álvaro Ramírez is a genius at what might be called programming at the edges. By that I mean he&rsquo;s good a finding and solving small problems that can negatively effect our workflows. A great example of that is his <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command">dwim-shell-command</a> package. Of course, he written some full fledged applications such as <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-for-ios">Journelly</a> as well.

His latest example of programming at the edges is a post <a href="https://xenodium.com/patching-your-homebrews-emacs-plus-macos">on how to patch an Emacs from Homebrew</a>. For those who don&rsquo;t know, <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is a package repository that provides pre-built packages for macOS and Linux.

After a long time of building Emacs from source, Ramírez starting using Emacs Plus from Homebrew. It&rsquo;s a lot easier than worrying about library dependencies, especially on macOS. But what happens if you want to patch Emacs Plus or some other Homebrew package?
</p>
<p>
Ramírez, of course, has the answer. It&rsquo;s just the sort of problem that he excels in. There&rsquo;s no point in me repeating his procedure. Most of us won&rsquo;t need it but if you&rsquo;re one who does, take a look at Ramírez&rsquo;s post.</p>
