I use GNUs for most of my email needs, but also have notmuch for rapid search of my inbox. Trouble is, when I choose a message in that notmuch search, it doesn&rsquo;t open it with gnus but with its own message-mode spinoff called Message[Notmuch]. In GNUS I have an automatically added BCC address (my &ldquo;sent-mail&rdquo; inbox, which is downloaded across devices to sync what I&rsquo;ve sent). How can I get the same automatic BCC added to anything I send in reply with Message[Notmuch]?
