The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> costs at least &#36;250 more than the entry-level <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, so is choosing the pricier model worth it? Or should you save the money and buy the 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;? This guide helps you to understand the differences between the two models and decide which is best for you.<br/>

The 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is positioned as an entry-level model with essential features for basic use, while the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is for users who need more from their tablet, such as students, creatives, or anyone who wants a future-proof device with newer, more advanced features. All of the differences between the entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; are listed below:<br/>

The entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is best for people who mainly use their &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for light, everyday tasks. If your typical day includes browsing Safari, watching YouTube or Netflix, reading articles, messaging friends, and maybe doing some basic schoolwork or light gaming, the 11th-gen &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has more than enough power and suitable features.<br/>
<br/>
The A16 chip is still very capable, and the device still has &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support for casual note-taking or drawing. However, the display is not laminated, which means there's a slight air gap between the glass and the screen content—something most users won't notice unless they're drawing or writing precisely. The entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; also lacks the anti-reflective coating, so it can be more reflective in bright lighting, as well as wide color support.<br/>
<br/>
It's a great choice for students or casual users who don't need advanced multitasking features or professional apps. The starting price of &#36;349 makes it especially appealing for families, kids, or those upgrading from an older &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. For many users, the extra &#36;250 to buy the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is not justified.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is for users who want noticeably more performance and versatility. Its M3 chip is noticeably faster and supports things the A16 doesn't, such as hardware-accelerated ray tracing and ProRes video encoding/decoding. That makes it far more suitable for video editing, high-end gaming, working with large documents, running creative apps like Affinity Photo or Logic Pro, or even writing code. It also supports &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, so if you want the latest AI features such as writing tools or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>, as well as anything Apple brings to &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; in the future, the Air is the better choice.<br/>
<br/>
The display is fully laminated, which eliminates the gap between your &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and the screen, making writing and drawing feel more natural—especially important if you're using &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro, which also brings extra features like barrel roll and haptic feedback. The 13-inch model offers significantly more screen real estate for multitasking, side-by-side apps, or content creation. It also supports &zwnj;Stage Manager&zwnj;, allowing true multi-window multitasking with resizable windows and external display support.<br/>
<br/>
If you're planning to use the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for productivity tasks or want something that feels more like a laptop alternative, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is likely the better choice. Its starting price is &#36;599 (or &#36;799 for the 13-inch), so it is a more substantial investment—but one that makes sense for users who will take advantage of its more advanced capabilities.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-11-vs-ipad-air/">iPad 11 vs. iPad Air Buyer&#039;s Guide: 30+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-11-vs-ipad-air-buyers-guide-30-differences-compared.2455006/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
