         <p>In this ~44 minute video I demonstrate packages that upgrade the
experience with Emacs. They are about the minibuffer: where we
interact with Emacs to call a command by its name or pick a candidate
for some action.</p>

<p>The packages I cover are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vertico</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">marginalia</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">orderless</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">embark</code>. I also mention briefly the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wgrep</code> package
as well as the built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">savehist-mode</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">recentf-mode</code>.</p>

<p>A related video I did about search (search+replace):

<h2>Sample configuration</h2>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; The `vertico' package applies a vertical layout to the minibuffer.</span>
<span class="c1">;; It also pops up the minibuffer eagerly so we can see the available</span>
<span class="c1">;; options without further interactions.  This package is very fast</span>
<span class="c1">;; and "just works", though it also is highly customisable in case we</span>
<span class="c1">;; need to modify its behaviour.</span>

  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">vertico-mode</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c1">;; The `marginalia' package provides helpful annotations next to</span>
<span class="c1">;; completion candidates in the minibuffer.  The information on</span>
<span class="c1">;; display depends on the type of content.  If it is about files, it</span>
<span class="c1">;; shows file permissions and the last modified date.  If it is a</span>
<span class="c1">;; buffer, it shows the buffer's size, major mode, and the like.</span>
<span class="c1">;;</span>

<span class="c1">;; The `orderless' package lets the minibuffer use an out-of-order</span>
<span class="c1">;; pattern matching algorithm.  It matches space-separated words or</span>
<span class="c1">;; regular expressions in any order.  In its simplest form, something</span>
<span class="c1">;; like "ins pac" matches `package-menu-mark-install' as well as</span>
<span class="c1">;; `package-install'.  This is a powerful tool because we no longer</span>
<span class="c1">;; need to remember exactly how something is named.</span>
<span class="c1">;;</span>
<span class="c1">;; Note that Emacs has lots of "completion styles" (pattern matching</span>
<span class="c1">;; algorithms), but let us keep things simple.</span>

<span class="c1">;; The `consult' package provides lots of commands that are enhanced</span>
<span class="c1">;; variants of basic, built-in functionality.  One of the headline</span>
<span class="c1">;; features of `consult' is its preview facility, where it shows in</span>
<span class="c1">;; another Emacs window the context of what is currently matched in</span>
<span class="c1">;; the minibuffer.  Here I define key bindings for some commands you</span>
<span class="c1">;; may find useful.  The mnemonic for their prefix is "alternative</span>

<span class="c1">;;</span>
<span class="c1">;; When inside the minibuffer, `embark' can collect/export the</span>

<span class="c1">;; command retains the original behaviour of the minibuffer, meaning</span>
<span class="c1">;; that if you navigate over the candidate at hit RET, it will do what</span>
<span class="c1">;; the minibuffer would have done.  In contrast, the `embark-export'</span>
<span class="c1">;; command reads the metadata to figure out what category this is and</span>
<span class="c1">;; places them in a buffer whose major mode is specialised for that</span>
<span class="c1">;; type of content.  For example, when we are completing against</span>
<span class="c1">;; files, the export will take us to a `dired-mode' buffer; when we</span>
