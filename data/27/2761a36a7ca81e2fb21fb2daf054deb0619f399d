Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> begins today, with the event kicking off at 10:00 am Pacific Time via the traditional opening keynote. We know that some <em>MacRumors</em> readers who can't follow the event as it's being broadcast are interested in avoiding all of the announcements and waiting until the event video is available for on-demand viewing so as to experience it without already knowing the outcome. <br/>

For those individuals, we've posted this news story, which will be updated with a direct link to the presentation once it becomes available from Apple. No other news stories or announcements will be displayed alongside this story.<br/>
<br/>
Replays of Apple's recent events have been made available to view almost immediately following the conclusion of the broadcasts, and we expect similar timing for today's event.<br/>
<br/>
Users waiting for the video to be posted are welcome to gather in the thread associated with this news story, and we ask that those who follow the events as they occur refrain from making any posts about Apple's announcements in this thread.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spoiler-free/">Spoiler-Free</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/wwdc-2025-spoiler-free/">WWDC 2025 Spoiler-Free Video Stream</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wwdc-2025-spoiler-free-video-stream.2458423/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
