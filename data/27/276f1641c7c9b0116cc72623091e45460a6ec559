<p>&#8220;The  <i>Journal of Political Philosophy</i>  will cease publication effective January 1, 2026.&#8221;<span id="more-54441"></span></p>

<p>Wiley had <a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/09/12/no-editorial-team-for-8-months-but-wiley-keeps-jpp-open-for-submissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempted to keep the journal going</a> without an academic editorial team in place, but those efforts have now come to an end. The publisher says, &#8220;All authors with active submissions will be contacted directly by Wiley to discuss available alternatives and next steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last issue of the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14679760/2023/31/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Journal of Political Philosophy </i></a>was published in December, 2023, following the departure of editor <a href="https://researchportalplus.anu.edu.au/en/persons/robert-goodin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Goodin</a> (ANU).</p>
<p>For readers who don&#8217;t recall the series of events, starting earlier that year, leading to the demise of that journal and, eventually, the creation of a new journal headed by Goodin, <a href="https://politicalphilosophyjournal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Political Philosophy</em></a>, that story is <a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/01/12/solidarity-among-philosophers-leads-to-new-journal-political-philosophy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
