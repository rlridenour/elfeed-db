<p>A blast struck a Chinese-run noodle restaurant inside a hotel in Kabul on Monday, killing seven people and wounding about a dozen, according to Afghan police and an Italian charity working in the country. Multiple outlets reported that the Islamic State’s Afghanistan affiliate (Islamic State Khorasan Province) claimed responsibility, describing the attack as targeting Chinese citizens. The attack hit the Shahr-e Naw area, a commercial district that includes embassies and is often described as one of the better-protected parts of the city, raising fresh questions about security for foreigners and Afghans alike.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lUDBi3imoFQwPecP9gt1ez0eHWXXh6OWfrzHGCBD05AS4iOGaTPDzzS0TfN_nUzkobYj9bnexDRyLGNLUah2G07xGK8QYtOsa3YT9M20E0BvrrKOi6amk6g4sSk1bA72FfRfGo2_S0lq96Gpmph-MheippDcuEjp9z9RS1tk2SvUXo4MS4wfkavGG_gILTAvFzLkiE5zHC4n8vBzUnE' alt='Taliban security personnel standing guard at a blast site after an explosion in the Shahr-e Naw area of Kabul on Monday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Where it hit: Police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said the explosion occurred near the kitchen of the restaurant, and social media videos showed debris outside and smoke pouring from a large hole in the building’s front.</li><li>Victims identified: Authorities identified the Chinese victim as “Ayub” and said the restaurant was jointly run by a Chinese Muslim, Abdul Majid, his wife, and an Afghan partner, Abdul Jabbar Mahmood, and served the Chinese Muslim community in Kabul.</li><li>Hospital response: The Italian humanitarian group EMERGENCY said it received 20 people at its hospital, including four women and a child, and reported that seven victims were dead on arrival.</li><li>Regional condemnation: Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the bombing, expressed sympathy for the injured, and said Chinese citizens have continued working on Afghanistan’s development despite security risks.</li><li>Claim rationale: In its claim of responsibility, Islamic State said it targeted Chinese citizens, a framing that analysts say could further heighten Beijing’s security concerns as China expands its engagement in Afghanistan.</li></ul><blockquote>So far, we have received 20 people at our hospital, - Dejan Panic</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Afghan police: Police said they were investigating the blast and initially reported no immediate word on its cause while casualty figures emerged from responders and officials.
