The second beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> includes a new ringtone that's an alternative to the classic "Reflection" ringtone that Apple uses as a default on iPhones. <br/>
<br/>

Apple didn't give the new ringtone a special name, and it's just listed as "Alt 1" as an option if you tap into Reflection. You can get to the ringtone in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; by opening up Sounds and Haptics in the Settings app, tapping on Ringtone, and then tapping on Reflection.<br/>
<br/>
The classic Reflection ringtone is still the default, so if you prefer the new sound, you'll need to set it manually. You can listen to the ringtone below. <br/>
