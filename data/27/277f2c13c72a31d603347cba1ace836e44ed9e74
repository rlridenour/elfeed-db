<p>I just found this in <a href="https://www.pme-math.org/journal/issues/PMEJ.Vol.1.No.1.2.3(reprint).pdf#page=16">a 1950 issue</a> of <em>Pi Mu Epsilon Journal</em>:</p>
<p>Question: How many legs has a horse?</p>
<p>Answer: Twelve; two in front, two behind, two on each side, and one in each corner.</p>
<p>Later in the same volume, Marlow Sholander shows that in fact every horse has <a href="https://www.pme-math.org/journal/issues/PMEJ.Vol.1.No.1.2.3(reprint).pdf#page=35">an infinite number of legs</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s to say nothing of <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2012/08/18/gray-area/">color</a>. And see <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2011/02/02/chasing-leo/">Chasing Leo</a>.</p>
