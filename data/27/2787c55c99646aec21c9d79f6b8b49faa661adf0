  <p>Several days after top national security officials accidentally
included a reporter in a Signal chat about bombing Houthi sites in
Yemen, a Pentagon-wide advisory warned against using the messaging
app, even for unclassified information.</p>

<p>“A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal messenger
application,” begins the department-wide email, dated March 18,
obtained by NPR. The memo continues, “Russian professional hacking
groups are employing the ‘linked devices’ features to spy on
encrypted conversations.” It notes that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-targeting-signal-messenger">Google has
identified</a> Russian hacking groups who are “targeting Signal
Messenger to spy on persons of interest.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not a weakness in Signal’s cryptography, it’s a hole in their device-mirroring setup. From that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-targeting-signal-messenger">Google Threat Intelligence post</a>, published last month:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most novel and widely used technique underpinning
Russian-aligned attempts to compromise Signal accounts is the
abuse of the app’s legitimate “<a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007320551-Linked-Devices">linked devices</a>” feature that
enables Signal to be used on multiple devices concurrently.
Because linking an additional device typically requires scanning a
quick-response (QR) code, threat actors have resorted to crafting
malicious QR codes that, when scanned, will link a victim’s
account to an actor-controlled Signal instance. If successful,
future messages will be delivered synchronously to both the victim
and the threat actor in real-time, providing a persistent means to
eavesdrop on the victim’s secure conversations without the need
for full-device compromise.</p>

<p>You’d have to be a bit of a doofus to fall for such a phishing attack if you were in a national security leadership position, but, well, our national security leadership positions are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/trump-admin-included-goldberg-in-yemen-war-plan-signal-group">currently occupied</a> by what the Russians call “useful idiots”.</p>
