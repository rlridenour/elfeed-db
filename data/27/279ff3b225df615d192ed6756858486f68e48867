<p>The president of the United States, on his blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for
raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and
China they should, as is said, “EAT THE TARIFFS,” and not charge
valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your
customers!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.” So I guess I’m wrong that Trump is a know-nothing ding-dong slipping rapidly into dementia, and in fact possesses a first-rate intelligence. Because it’s Trump — soon to win a Nobel Prize in economics for this keen insight — who has been braying to the world, non-stop, for years, <a href="https://youtu.be/WhR3i2UAGSQ?t=33">that tariffs are “a tax on a foreign country”</a>. </p>

<p>So given that China pays for any tariffs the US imposes on Chinese-made goods, I, for one, don’t have the intellect to understand how there are any tariffs for Walmart to 
eat. I’m sure Trump is right and Walmart — a company whose “always low prices” brand results in <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/WMT/walmart/net-profit-margin">net profit margins between 2–3%</a> — will somehow “eat the tariffs” without losing money. I don’t know why the WSJ Editorial Board <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trumps-everyday-high-prices-kamala-walmart-price-hike-tariff-439cb183">is so upset about this</a> — the Republican Party has always been in favor of government price controls.</p>
