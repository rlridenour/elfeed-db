<p>In the latest development across south and Southeast Asia, authorities in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Malaysia are mounting large‑scale rescue and recovery operations after days of intense monsoon rains, fuelled by tropical cyclones, triggered catastrophic floods and landslides that have killed more than 1,000 people in under a week. Indonesia’s Sumatra island and Sri Lanka have been hardest hit, with Indonesia confirming more than 440 deaths and hundreds missing, while Sri Lanka’s government reports over 330 fatalities in what its president has described as the country’s largest and most challenging natural disaster in its history. Military troops have been deployed in both Indonesia and Sri Lanka to reach cut‑off communities, distribute food, water and medicine, and help clear roads blocked by landslides and fallen trees, as some districts remain inaccessible due to collapsed bridges and deep mud. Officials and scientists link the severity of the event to the interaction of seasonal monsoon systems with Cyclone Ditwah and other storms, and warn that climate change is contributing to more intense rainfall events in the region.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JTYn2tES4VntchTmg77ojANnD_BWyTc-MarT5_JRtGVYh6AtwpXD3u3vhYsKefOE5PBx13eL7oEHR03fh1BaFS_UsdFUN5BiIlDu8bDSl5qwgn9MNQJ6uEXSevlAHwdXCeXnHZnFSUF_lQmAuI87Gs6lqHh8Si8uiGuGAx42yHSfS82epKa_QFda9G8' alt='Flood damage in a residential district of Indonesia’s Aceh province following days of torrential rain.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Countries affected: The same weather pattern has drenched Sri Lanka, Indonesia’s Sumatra, southern Thailand and northern Malaysia, leaving entire towns inundated and large rural areas underwater across four countries.</li><li>Scale in Indonesia: Indonesia’s disaster agency reports 442 deaths and about 402 people unaccounted for in Sumatra alone, after floods and landslides swept away homes and buried neighborhoods.</li><li>Sri Lanka emergency: Sri Lanka’s authorities say more than 1.3 million residents have been affected, nearly 20,000 homes destroyed, and over 196,000 people displaced following Cyclone Ditwah’s passage across the island.</li><li>Thailand and Malaysia: Thai officials count at least 162 deaths from flooding and landslides, while northern Malaysia has also suffered fatalities and widespread damage amid the same spell of intense rainfall.</li><li>Infrastructure damage: Collapsed bridges, blocked highways and power outages have hampered relief efforts, with nearly a third of Sri Lanka temporarily without electricity or running water after the cyclone.</li></ul><blockquote>We are facing the largest and most challenging natural disaster in our history. - President Anura Kumara Dissanayake</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka’s president framed the flooding as the nation’s largest and most challenging natural disaster and pledged to rebuild with international assistance while a state of emergency is in force.
