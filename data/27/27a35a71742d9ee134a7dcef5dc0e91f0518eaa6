iLemming has an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44024086">interesting post on Hacker News</a> about why younger engineers don&rsquo;t use Emacs and why they should. You may find the post a bit overwritten but I especially like the ending:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The specialized app user lives in rented apartments; the Emacs devotee walks through an ever-expanding mansion whose rooms rearrange themselves to their thoughts.
</p>

That&rsquo;s a nice metaphor for the Emacs experience. Whatever you need it to be, Emacs will change itself to accommodate you. We usually talk about Emacs as being a clay that we can mold into whatever shape we desire but I like this description better.

Not everybody agrees. Over at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1kq3pjx/the_emacs_devotee_walks_through_an_everexpanding/">Emacs subreddit</a> there&rsquo;s a bit of pushback. That&rsquo;s fine but some responses, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1kq3pjx/comment/mt94q3e/">like this one</a>, just seem uninformed. You can tell that the commenter doesn&rsquo;t really know what they&rsquo;re talking about because they refer to Emacs as &ldquo;eMacs&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not a big thing but it&rsquo;s a sure sign that the commenter isn&rsquo;t really familiar with the subject matter.

All that aside, I really like the metaphor of Emacs being a mansion whose rooms rearrange themselves to suite your needs.</p>
