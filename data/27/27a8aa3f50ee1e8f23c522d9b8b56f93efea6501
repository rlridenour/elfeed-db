<blockquote>
  <p>One woman described arriving at Krome — a facility that typically
<a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2024-04/OIG-24-21-Apr24.pdf">only holds men</a> — late at night on January 28. Officers then
confined her for days with dozens of other women without bedding
or privacy, in a cell normally used only during incarceration
intake procedures. “There was only one toilet, and it was covered
in feces,” she said. “We begged the officers to let us clean it,
but they just said sarcastically, ‘Housekeeping will come soon.’
No one ever came.”</p>

<p>A man recalled the frigid conditions in the intake cell where he
was detained: “They turned up the air conditioning... You could
not fall asleep because it was so cold. I thought I was going to
experience hypothermia.”</p>

<p>This report documents serious violations of medical standards.
Detention facility staff routinely denied individuals with
diabetes, asthma, kidney conditions, and chronic pain their
prescribed medications and access to doctors. In one case at
Krome, a woman with gallstones began vomiting and lost
consciousness after being denied care for several days. Officers
returned her to the same cell after emergency surgery to remove
her gallbladder — still without medication. [...]</p>

<p>Staff were dismissive or abusive even when detainees were
undergoing a visibly obvious medical crisis. For example, staff
ignored a detained immigrant who began coughing blood in a crowded
holding cell for hours. In that case, unrest ensued, and a
Disturbance Control Team stormed the cell, forcing the men in it
to lie face down on the wet, dirty floor while officers zip-tied
their hands behind their backs. A detainee said he heard an
officer order the cell’s CCTV camera feed to be turned off.
Another detainee said a team member slapped him while shouting,
“Shut the fuck up.”</p>

<p>During another incident, officers made men eat while shackled with
their hands behind their backs after forcing the group to wait
hours for lunch: “We had to bend over and eat off the chairs with
our mouths, like dogs,” one man said.</p>
