Last year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a new AirTag would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/">released around the middle of 2025</a>. More recently, a leaker known as Kosutami claimed that Apple plans to release a new AirTag <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/airtag-2-in-may-or-june-rumor/">in May or June</a> this year. Both of those timeframes suggest that the next AirTag is up to a month or two away from launching. <br/>

Three upgrades have been rumored for the AirTag 2 so far:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>A second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/airtag-2-longer-range-rumor/">up to 3× longer range</a> compared to the current AirTag. The chip debuted in the iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models, there is a Precision Finding for People feature that can help you to find your friends in crowded places, and it offers a range of up to 200 feet (approximately 60 meters).</li><br/>
<li>A more tamper-proof speaker, as a safety measure to reduce stalking.</li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/">Improved integration with the Apple Vision Pro</a>.</li></ul>No major design changes are expected.<br/>
