The home hub device that Apple plans to release as soon as this spring has a "robotic swiveling base," according to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-developing-ai-wearable-pin">The Information</a></em>'s Wayne Ma. Ma mentioned the new detail in a piece outlining <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/apple-ai-pin/">Apple's work on an AI pin</a>.<br/>

<blockquote>Apple is also working on a home product featuring a small display, speakers and a robotic swiveling base, designed with a heavy emphasis on AI features. That device could be released as soon as this spring, according to two of the people.</blockquote><br/>
We've heard a lot of rumors about the home hub because it was supposed to launch in 2025, but to date, no rumors have suggested that it will have a swiveling robotic base. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> previously said that Apple is developing two versions of the hub, one that's meant to be mounted on the wall and another that has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> mini-like speaker base that can be placed on a desktop or countertop.<br/>
<br/>
No prior descriptions of the home hub base have suggested that it will have any kind of swivel function or that it will be robotic. In fact, the wording sounds similar to how Gurman has described Apple's tabletop robot, which will be a 2027 follow up to the home hub.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/">said the tabletop robot</a> will have an iPad-like display mounted on a thin robotic arm that allows the display to tilt up and down and rotate 360 degrees. The device will be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-launching-robot-virtual-companion-in-2027/">reposition itself</a> to face whoever is speaking, and it is said to have a "visual personality."<br/>
<br/>
Ma did not go into detail on the purpose of the robotic swiveling base, or how it will work, but presumably it would be able to move to face people. The home hub is supposed to have an array of sensors that let it determine when someone is in the room.<br/>
<br/>
We are expecting the home hub to launch in the coming months, right around the time that Apple debuts iOS 26.4 with the upgraded version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">Apple Command Center</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-robot/">Apple Robot</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/home-hub-robotic-swivel-base/">Apple&#039;s Upcoming Home Hub Could Include &#039;Robotic Swiveling Base&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-upcoming-home-hub-could-include-robotic-swiveling-base.2476412/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
