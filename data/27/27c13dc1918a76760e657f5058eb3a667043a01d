Earlier this week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-announces-new-airtag/">announced</a> the second-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;, marking the first major update to its item tracker since the product's introduction in 2021, with improvements focused on tracking range, audio output, and device support rather than changes to its physical design.<br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; uses a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that extends Precision Finding range by up to 50%, adds support for Precision Finding on compatible Apple Watch models for the first time, and includes an upgraded Bluetooth specification designed to improve general tracking range. Apple also says the built-in speaker is up to 50% louder, making it easier to locate items in noisy environments.<br/>

<br/>
Externally, the &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; remains visually similar to the original and continues to use a replaceable CR2032 coin battery with more than a year of battery life, while Apple has made a significant number of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/airtag-2-full-of-hidden-changes/">internal changes</a>. The second-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; is priced the same as before at &#36;29 for a single unit or &#36;99 for a four-pack, is compatible with existing &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; accessories, and requires devices running iOS 26.2.1 or later.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/apple-creator-studio-now-available/">launched Creator Studio</a>, a new all-in-one subscription aimed at content creators. For &#36;12.99 per month, or &#36;129 per year, Creator Studio provides access to Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage, consolidating tools for video editing, music production, image editing, and live performance. The bundle replaces Apple's long-standing one-time purchase model for these apps with a subscription approach, while keeping standalone versions available for users who do not want access to the full package.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond bundling existing apps, Creator Studio introduces a set of AI-powered features that are exclusive to subscribers. These include transcript and visual search in Final Cut Pro, enhanced beat detection and new dynamic titles, AI-assisted session players and harmonic analysis in Logic Pro, and new design and warp tools in Pixelmator Pro, which is now available on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> for the first time. The subscription also unlocks premium AI features in Apple's free productivity apps, including Keynote, Pages, and Numbers, with Freeform support coming later.<br/>
<br/>
Creator Studio is available now via the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, with a one-month free trial for all users and a three-month trial for customers who purchase a qualifying new Mac or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The subscription supports Family Sharing for up to six people, and features discounted pricing for students and educators.<br/>
