<h3 style="text-align: center;">Sylvia Burrow (1969-2025)</h3>
<p>After more than a decade of fighting a brain tumour and exhausting her treatment options, Sylvia Jane Burrow, professor in the Department of Humanities at Cape Breton University, chose to end her life with medical assistance on December 1, 2025 at the age of 56.</p>
<p>She received a BA from Dalhousie University and MA from the University of Alberta and completed her PhD at the University of Western Ontario in 2003, under the supervision of Samantha Brennan. After visiting professor positions at the University of Utah and the University of Limerick, Sylvia joined the Philosophy Department (latterly, the Department of Humanities) at Cape Breton University.</p>
<p>While spanning a range of philosophical subdisciplines, including bioethics (e.g., “<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=RD2Sy_MAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=RD2Sy_MAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC">On the cutting edge: ethical responsiveness to cesarean rates</a>”, feminist ethics (e.g., “<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=RD2Sy_MAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=RD2Sy_MAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC">Sexual autonomy and violence against women</a>”, argumentation theory (e.g., “<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=RD2Sy_MAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=RD2Sy_MAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC">Verbal sparring and apologetic points: Politeness in gendered argumentation contexts</a>”), philosophy of emotions (e.g., “<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=RD2Sy_MAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=RD2Sy_MAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC">The political structure of emotion: From dismissal to dialogue</a>”, and the philosophy of sport (e.g., “<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=RD2Sy_MAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=RD2Sy_MAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC">The Interconnection of Aesthetics and Ethics as Revealed in Martial Arts</a>” [with Jason Holt]), Sylvia’s work is remarkably thematically unified. It addresses perennial concerns about the ways that oppression damages moral agency.</p>
<p>Sylvia also brought her knowledge of karate (which she also taught) and her proficiency as a martial artist to her academic work. Her 2022 book, <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/ca/gender-violence-9781978752948/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Gender Violence: Resistance, Resilience, and Autonomy</em></a> (Rowman and Littlefield), explores how gender violence, and the vulnerability and fear that accompanies it, undermine autonomy. Sylvia argued that self-defence training is a means not only of physically protecting oneself but also building autonomy capacities, such as self-trust and self-worth. In this way, the book draws awareness to the everyday oppression of gender violence while pointing to possibilities of resistance to, and resilience despite, that oppression.</p>
<p>Sylvia’s work and life exemplified feminist praxis and the East Asian idea of philosophy as a <em>dao</em>, bringing philosophical reflection to the way she lived her life and loved those around her. No less significantly, Sylvia drew from her experience as a woman, a mother, a martial artist, and a teacher in her philosophical work.</p>
