<p>Dear God, show me the way to be content with my fully working Emacs-config and give me strength to resist temptation to tinker with some fancy bullshit functionality or package that will break everything for the 100th time and I will probably never use.Let my startup time always be low. Amen. #emacs</p>

<p>I have been struggling with this. I don’t want to keep monkeying with my configuration. I like where I am in terms of the functionality that Emacs offers me, and I need to keep using the editor and stop customizing it.</p>
<h2 id="ditching-god-mode">Ditching god-mode</h2>
<p>I liked god-mode. Don’t need it anymore. I use the general.el setup for almost all the commands that I use regularly. I find that I don’t use the Ctrl key commands all that much. The usual commands are bound to <code>M-o</code>. Using the Ctrl key once in a while is not a pain that justifies god-mode. I have disabled god-mode. Living in plain vanilla Emacs is a freeing exercise.</p>

<p>I didn’t know about this. It is built-in to Emacs and is a good addition to my workflow. karthinks.com is an amazing resource.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Orgonomic replaces return and backspace in org-mode with versions that behave more like they do in a word processor. That is, return at the end of a bulletted list will extend the list. A second return will delete the hanging bullet. Backspace in a bulleted list will delete the bullet or reduce its level by one if it indented. The same is true for headline levels.</p>

<p>This is useful to me.</p>
