  Mac users with the Studio Display have been complaining about intermittent flickering since the [macOS Tahoe] update launched in September. There are also complaints from users who have other kinds of displays, so it might be a bug that is affecting more than one type of external monitor.

<p>I’m glad this is finally gaining some attention because I have been seeing this since the earliest betas of Tahoe back in June (I complained about it again <a href="https://zeppelin.flights/@dmoren/115652922362281797">more recently</a>). And that’s been on multiple Macs, including my Mac mini attached to a Studio Display, my old M1 MacBook Air, and my current M4 MacBook Air. I’ve tried deactivating several of the display features to see if makes a difference (TrueTone, Night Shift, automatically adjusted brightness); it felt like maybe turning off Night Shift helped, but it’s one of those frustrating intermittent issues that can be hard to track down.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I’ve heard from others with this problem, and it’s definitely only been happening to me since Tahoe. I’m surprised Apple hasn’t squashed this bug yet, but hopefully gaining more attention will shed some more light on it.</p>
