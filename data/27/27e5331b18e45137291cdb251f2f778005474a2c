I&rsquo;ve been continually seeking the answer to Garden CSS&rsquo;s title question: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s possible when you trade a preprocessor for a programming language?&rdquo; I have used Garden exclusively for years, happily wielding garden-gnome to implement hot-loading on my front-end for an excellent development experience. Writing CSS with Clojure data-structures is a hands-down win over raw css-writing, and Garden also gives useful shortcuts that some of the preprocessors also have like lighten, darken, &amp; selectors, and more.
