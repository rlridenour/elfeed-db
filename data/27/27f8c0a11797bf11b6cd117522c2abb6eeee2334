<p>A UN treaty covering biodiversity in international waters entered into force on Saturday, creating a legally binding framework for how countries manage and protect marine life on the high seas—vast areas that sit outside any single nation’s jurisdiction. The agreement aims to help meet a global goal of protecting 30% of the ocean environment by 2030, including by enabling a network of marine protected areas in previously lightly regulated waters. Supporters describe it as a hopeful step toward curbing pressures such as overfishing, while some countries that have not yet ratified it—such as the United States and, so far, the UK—face growing pressure to join so they can fully shape how the new rules are implemented.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/kGh-E9kLWv9affDgVuITZKCQEw9yrOElnUUyT8pzhMCoOsqtkAStdbb078VrejVHR2x9U9ICcHGdJjLFnu9CJX70MnD3Wa9Po_aS3jk4zRRx' alt='A tuna swims among a school of fish as a scuba diver looks on at the Galapagos Marine Reserve.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Long road: Negotiators finalized the treaty in March 2023 after about 15 years of negotiations, reflecting the difficulty of setting shared rules for international waters.</li><li>Legal threshold: The agreement entered into force after reaching 60 national ratifications on September 19 last year, triggering a 120-day countdown to activation.</li><li>Ratification momentum: Ratifications have since climbed to more than 80, with China, Brazil and Japan among the later additions, according to the reporting.</li><li>UK domestic pace: Campaigners warned that a British bill to implement the treaty has moved at a “glacial pace” in parliament, and they say delay could leave the UK sidelined from an upcoming “Ocean Cop” summit.</li><li>High seas scale: Australian official Adam McCarthy highlighted that the high seas cover roughly two-thirds of the ocean and about half the planet’s surface, underscoring the treaty’s geographic reach.</li></ul><blockquote>It’s two-thirds of the ocean, (and) it’s half the surface of the planet that for the first time will have a comprehensive legal regime, - Adam McCarthy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>High Seas Alliance (environmental coalition): The coalition says broad—ideally universal—ratification matters for effective implementation, even though the treaty has already met the entry-into-force threshold.
