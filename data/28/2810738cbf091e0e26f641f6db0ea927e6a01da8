<p>Pakistan’s military and Balochistan police say they have ended a roughly 40-hour counterterrorism operation in the southwestern province of Balochistan, reporting 145 insurgents killed after coordinated attacks that included suicide bombings and gun assaults. Officials said the earlier attacks left dozens dead, including civilians and security personnel, and triggered a manhunt for remaining assailants. The Pakistani government has accused India of backing the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a banned separatist group that claimed responsibility for the assaults, while India’s foreign ministry rejected the allegations as baseless and pointed to Pakistan’s internal problems. The flare-up underscores the long-running unrest in a resource-rich region where Pakistan has been seeking to attract outside investment, even as violence raises concerns about security for residents and projects alike.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/KE_EG83j_2QE3GUAKpwp9ouu4-U7g6wdkldhOx_t8lKw_q-ftxMvext8QXAs3REFV3rDgsgAam2c8aZ8xZLoVjE9suPa34kL7tN0QiwwVaN3O5YM5MVQu3PzEcX4B9ZX7hmmbe61lKshPwiHY51PYwNUexxcHBBCzf--L5v1lagOqDEyEPv-DEn5K2NeZ2Y08Qkc4ySALEpe9Xdzhrpkl-PJFzhb22wc77VO12JRDj8GwGgnu2yqaIpppBf8dKWW6gGuridbOB9Hs2fqHg' alt='A man stands beside burnt vehicles inside a torched police station on the outskirts of Quetta, after an attack blamed on Baloch separatists.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who claimed attacks: The banned Baloch Liberation Army said it carried out recent assaults targeting security forces, civilians and infrastructure, according to multiple reports.</li><li>Toll breakdown: Pakistan’s announcement included separate reported deaths of 18 civilians and 15 security personnel during the operation and related violence.</li><li>Rebel tactics: NDTV reported the BLA described its offensive as “Operation Herof Phase II” and claimed the use of IED attacks and suicide attackers, including women, though the claim is not independently verified in the reports provided.</li><li>Policy debate: Al Jazeera’s discussion framed Islamabad’s challenge as balancing security operations with addressing local grievances that fuel separatist support in Balochistan.</li><li>Investment backdrop: CBS noted the violence struck a region central to Pakistan’s push to draw foreign investment into mining and minerals, raising stakes beyond immediate security concerns.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pakistan government/military: Officials say the operation killed 145 fighters and allege the attacks were conducted by “Indian-sponsored” or “Indian-backed” militants linked to the BLA.
