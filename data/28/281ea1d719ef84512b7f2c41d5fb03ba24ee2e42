<p>On October 15, President Trump confirmed he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela and said his administration is weighing strikes on land against alleged drug cartels, following recent lethal maritime actions in the Caribbean [france24.com#2][nytimes.com#1][bbc.com#1]. The maritime campaign has destroyed at least five suspected smuggling boats since early September, with reports of 27 fatalities overall; on Tuesday he posted a video of a strike that killed six men off Venezuela’s coast [scmp.com#1][time.com#1]. Trump cited drug trafficking and migration—including an unsubstantiated claim that Venezuela sent prisoners to the United States—as reasons for the move [dawn.com#1][firstpost.com#1]. The New York Times reported the authorization could permit lethal CIA actions in Venezuela, while Trump declined to say whether the agency could target President Nicolás Maduro; DW reported he ruled that out [nytimes.com#1][euronews.com#1][bbc.com#1][dw.com#1]. Caracas denounced the move as regime-change interference, urged Americans to avoid war in the region, and called for dialogue, as Washington maintains a $50 million reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest on drug charges [elpais.com#1][bbc.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#1][dawn.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RzqZeLS9wlTtqQ_F0iluEUdSpjCd179gs7YFl9trREVVnVv8LOvlHsUdIHWRT_1x2XKQk9aHAbMSgYRbkUaVowIk0r0QUvnnbiY2x7eiClWy' alt='President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office, October 15, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Maritime campaign: U.S. forces have destroyed at least five boats since early September; SCMP reports 27 fatalities, and a Tuesday video shared by the President showed a strike that killed six men off Venezuela’s coast [scmp.com#1][time.com#1].</li><li>CIA posture: The CIA has surged personnel to the Caribbean and Central America, and reporting indicates new authority for covert actions that could occur unilaterally or alongside broader military operations [washingtonpost.com#1][nytimes.com#1][semafor.com#1].</li><li>Legal scrutiny: Legal scholars and United Nations experts have questioned whether the boat strikes comply with international law, with critics calling them unlawful [time.com#1][theguardian.com#1].</li><li>Bounty and sanctions: Washington has offered a $50 million reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest and previously imposed sweeping sanctions to pressure his government [theglobeandmail.com#1][dawn.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>We are looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Says he authorized CIA operations to curb drug trafficking and is now considering land options after claiming maritime routes are under control.
