<p>Russian forces carried out a prolonged overnight barrage of drones and missiles against Kyiv and several other Ukrainian regions early Saturday, striking residential areas and energy infrastructure and leaving multiple civilians dead and dozens injured, according to Ukrainian officials. Local authorities reported that debris from intercepted drones caused fires in apartment buildings and houses, while parts of western Kyiv temporarily lost electricity after hits on the power grid. The attack lasted close to 10 hours and formed part of what Ukrainian officials described as a large-scale assault across the country that also cut power to hundreds of thousands of households beyond the capital. The strikes came just as a second round of US-led peace negotiations involving Ukrainian and Russian representatives was due to begin in the United States, underscoring how active diplomacy and heavy fighting continue in parallel.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/5cqZsDS8FeGe7dHeSRpfpZTP5t64LaNeFBO5gLtuR7g8jOivZkXwzHAwDVf-rSiQnU1kVm9BLz_iZ1qg6NIo9vt6XZOQ3KrjpQOEp5MZ9VxV3OU0geswtT8go8ou_adCUU4TBwz4uSjmuhOFCxP4NlBH0P5R3vdpm_PdcyMQCAi2z7ZfZW7X_7uVv3HKduUXtKAURXI09Xuldg' alt='A damaged house in Kyiv after an overnight Russian drone strike.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Air defense effort: Kyiv’s air defenses engaged multiple incoming targets through the night, with authorities warning residents to remain in shelters as falling debris from intercepted drones posed additional risks on the ground.</li><li>Power grid damage: The wider overnight assault on Ukraine’s energy system left more than 600,000 households without electricity after strikes on the grid, highlighting continued pressure on the country’s civilian infrastructure.</li><li>Human rights clampdown: In a separate development, Russian authorities labeled the international NGO Human Rights Watch as an “undesirable” organization, effectively banning its activities in Russia amid the ongoing war.</li><li>City services response: Kyiv’s mayor reported that emergency services worked through the morning to extinguish fires, clear rubble, and restore basic utilities in affected districts following the strikes.</li><li>Diplomatic momentum: US officials planned to host a second round of Ukraine-related peace discussions over the weekend, part of what several outlets describe as a renewed diplomatic push to find a path toward ending the conflict.</li></ul><blockquote>We see this as an attempt to intimidate Ukrainians on the eve of important talks aimed at restoring peace. - Unnamed Ukrainian official quoted by ABC News</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Ukraine: Ukrainian officials framed the overnight attacks as attempts to pressure Kyiv and its partners just as new diplomatic efforts to end the war get under way.
