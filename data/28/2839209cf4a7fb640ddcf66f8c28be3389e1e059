<p>Spain’s cabinet has approved a decree to regularise undocumented migrants and some asylum seekers, with the government saying the measure could cover around 500,000 people and is expected to take effect in April. Eligibility described in the reports includes proving residence in Spain for at least five months before 31 December 2025, having no criminal record, and in some cases having applied for international protection by that date. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and his government argue the plan supports Spain’s economy and helps address labour needs alongside an ageing population, while critics on the right call it a “reward” for irregular migration and pledge to roll it back if they return to power.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Tr_KsKhJ8_ReylVGCPqu11uqxlma4r_Y4_GbKYherLcrFGTLrIdnzxFebau6jvyAYMGnnJhzHjyITtAe9k6q_m61wOgZgkxMMgK7WzNODJP81k5hAAX8VP7hNEi-XGd-sj4wYa0YG1nZpZrS7p5PP9x1M8G-o18ml4n6kEWuiA' alt='Illustrative image accompanying reporting on Spain’s migrant regularisation plan.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who qualifies: The scheme is described as offering one-year residence and work permits, with beneficiaries able to work in any sector and anywhere in Spain, according to Spain’s migration minister.</li><li>Political pathway: Several outlets report the decree route lets the minority government act amid a fragmented parliament, putting immigration at the center of Spain’s domestic political divide.</li><li>Economic argument: Sánchez has framed migration as a major contributor to Spain’s recent growth, with one report citing his view that it accounted for 80% of the country’s dynamic economic growth in the past six years.</li><li>Opposition backlash: The opposition Popular Party’s Alberto Núñez Feijóo is reported to have vowed to repeal the measure if elected, while Vox leader Santiago Abascal called for mass deportations and used “invasion” rhetoric.</li><li>European context: Multiple reports describe Spain’s move as running against a broader European trend toward tougher migration policies, with one comparing it to approaches championed by President Trump in the US.</li></ul><blockquote>Spain “lacks people” and must choose between being “a closed and poor nation” or “opening itself to the world to ensure prosperity.” - Pedro Sánchez</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Spanish government (Socialist-led coalition): The government says the regularisation will help fill workforce needs, support an ageing society, and integrate people already living and working in Spain.
