<p>Back in November, Apple quietly published a <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/exploring-llms-mlx-m5">research article</a> about the Neural Accelerators in the M5 chip. The numbers are wild.</p>



<p>The base M5 MacBook Pro already delivers up to 4x faster time-to-first-token compared to the M4 when running large language models through MLX. Image generation with FLUX is 3.8x faster. This is on the <em>base</em> chip with 24GB of unified memory.</p>



<p>Think about what happens when the M5 Pro and M5 Max show up with more memory bandwidth and more Neural Accelerators. And eventually the M5 Ultra in the Mac Studio.</p>



<p>Right now, people serious about running local AI often look at expensive PC builds with dedicated GPUs. The M5 generation might change that math entirely. A well-configured M5 Max MacBook Pro or Mac Studio could become the machine for people who want to run models locally, privately, on their own hardware.</p>



<p>Apple&#8217;s unified memory architecture was always a theoretical advantage for AI workloads. With the M5&#8217;s Neural Accelerators, that advantage is becoming very real. If you&#8217;re interested in local AI and you&#8217;re on an M3 or earlier, I&#8217;d wait for these announcements before buying anything.</p>
