<p>Iran’s parliament speaker said Tehran now considers the armed forces of European Union member states to be “terrorist groups,” describing the move as retaliation after the EU designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a terrorist organisation. Iranian officials and lawmakers presented the step as a response to what they called a symbolic and political EU shift on Iran, tied in European statements to Iran’s handling of a recent protest wave and ensuing crackdown. The immediate practical effect of Iran’s designation remained unclear in the reporting, but it further raises the temperature in already tense Iran-Europe relations.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/0MsNrUVCx5zbtCJFXCBgOW0Qo0gfQgL8CN3IlMCJwojQmpNrUcPwry16vqkZxSXSSCdfdRGUCo6XTcPMQjPXrY5-LJJQ3spgr8AmVL0N_Ft1' alt='Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf after a press conference in Beirut (Reuters file photo, Oct. 12, 2024).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Parliamentary follow-up: Iran’s parliament speaker said lawmakers may consider expelling EU countries’ military attaches, with Iran’s national security parliamentary commission set to deliberate and coordinate with the foreign ministry.</li><li>Uniformed session: Iranian lawmakers wore IRGC uniforms during the session and chanted slogans including “Shame on you, Europe,” according to state TV footage described in reports.</li><li>Legal basis cited: Iran framed the step under “Article 7” of a law on countermeasures against labeling the IRGC a terrorist organisation, a measure reported to date back to 2019 after a similar US designation.</li><li>EU sanctions package: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed both the IRGC designation and a political agreement on new Iran-related sanctions targeting 15 individuals and six entities, according to reporting.</li><li>Diplomacy note: DW reported that Iran’s president called for tensions with Washington to be resolved diplomatically, even as the Iran-EU tit-for-tat unfolded.</li></ul><blockquote>By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards … the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot and once again made a decision against the interests of their people by blindly obeying the Americans, - Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iranian parliament leadership: Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf framed Iran’s designation as a legal countermeasure under Iranian law and argued the EU acted against Europeans’ interests by aligning with the United States; he also raised possible steps such as reviewing the presence of EU military attaches.
