<p>If you’re someone who loves your keyboard but understands how much of a productivity boost you could get from voice dictation, <a href="https://whispertype.com">you need to check out WhisperType.</a>​</p>
<p>WhisperType brings high-quality speech-to-text transcription to the Mac with a clever twist: It’s designed for people who love using the keyboard. You can start or stop dictation with a hotkey, and once your words are transcribed, you get full control to navigate, edit, and format using just your keyboard. No awkward mouse-clicking or hunting for buttons. Moreover, while you’re dictating, you can add carriage returns. Just press the Return key.</p>
<p>It’s built on Whisper, the open-source transcription engine from OpenAI, so the accuracy is seriously impressive, even in less-than-ideal environments. While WhisperType uses cloud processing for transcription, your files are deleted immediately after returning the result, maintaining your privacy and security. You can even set up custom spelling for unusual words you use all the time, such as the names of people or products.</p>
<p>Use it to create quick outlines or process a bunch of email replies. Speak the words, then zip through edits with your keyboard setup. It’s the speed of dictation with the precision of typing.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever wished macOS dictation was just a little smarter, or if you’ve avoided voice tools because they didn’t feel built for you, WhisperType is worth a look. It’s fast and feels right at home on a Mac.</p>
