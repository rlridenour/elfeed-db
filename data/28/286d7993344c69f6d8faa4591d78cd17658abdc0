But live streaming immersive video hasn’t happened yet.</figcaption></figure>
<p>After much anticipation, it’s finally happening. On Thursday <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/spectrum-brings-nba-games-in-apple-immersive-to-apple-vision-pro/">Apple and Charter Communications</a> announced that “a selection of Los Angeles Lakers matchups” will be streamed <a href="https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/spectrum-introduces-the-spectrum-app-store">live and immersive to the Vision Pro</a>. Charter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  With Apple Immersive, a remarkable storytelling format available on Vision Pro, Lakers fans will feel like they are sitting courtside for those games. Live games, available via streams of up to 150 Mbps, will be accessible to authenticated Spectrum SportsNet subscribers, as well as Spectrum Internet customers, via the Spectrum SportsNet app in the Lakers’ territory. The game replay and highlights in Apple Immersive will also be available on demand via the Spectrum SportsNet app across the Spectrum footprint and on the NBA App for national and international fans.

<p>Since the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/06/eyes-and-head-on-with-the-apple-vision-pro/">very first Vision Pro demos</a> showed a third baseman’s throw to first go wide of the bag at Fenway Park, it’s been clear that immersive video could really transform the sports experience. I have no idea what it feels like to sit courtside at an NBA game—though I did sit courtside at a few Cal women’s basketball games last winter!—but I am looking forward to trying it out.</p>
<p>The first game will be streaming by early next year. Games will be captured using the new URSA Cine Immersive Live cameras from Blackmagic.</p>
