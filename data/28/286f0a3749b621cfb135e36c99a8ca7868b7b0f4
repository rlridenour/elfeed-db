<p>Lithuania has declared a nationwide emergency situation after a surge of balloons believed to be launched from neighboring Belarus repeatedly violated its airspace and disrupted flights at Vilnius Airport in recent weeks. Authorities say many of the balloons appear to be meteorological or simple devices carrying cigarette contraband, but they still pose a safety risk to aviation and raise security concerns on NATO’s eastern flank during the ongoing war in Ukraine. The emergency status allows Lithuania’s government and security services to react more quickly, temporarily halt air traffic, and deploy additional resources to track and neutralize the objects near the border. While Lithuanian officials blame Belarus for tolerating or facilitating the launches, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko has publicly called for negotiations on border tensions and stated that his country does not seek conflict.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/BsYYZojhyaxbdnoRLYaKAnM1qn-Tjmz5FG65fH5sqqXxUsLVLVn0PDKtOywz2aIkiwZkFmsCUkzMhIJl2FityNR6oGH1NH2ec_SYnCEQ2W69oOWw_uRaDgkUJdrEhwidHN2ANlww0NHW7NSuZRwhi4PUwCSLSwvoujwpJIv-h9GPsQzO-om4fyWSs34Il23bvK1ojqA9hH6wel9qPw53pbc4ut3ETMz-Dn0sQokPOGouFuEg_uusF-bm4A' alt='Confiscated balloons and packages used to smuggle cigarettes from Belarus into Lithuania.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of incursions: Lithuanian officials report that so far this year hundreds of balloons linked to smuggling activities and almost two hundred drones have entered their airspace from the direction of Belarus, illustrating a persistent pattern rather than isolated incidents.</li><li>Airport disruptions: Vilnius Airport has had to suspend operations multiple times while air traffic controllers ensured that commercial aircraft were safely separated from the slow-moving balloons, leaving thousands of passengers temporarily stranded and forcing some flights to divert.</li><li>Smuggling method: Investigators say many balloons are used to carry cigarette packets across the border on the wind, allowing smugglers to avoid crossing checkpoints physically while still delivering contraband into EU territory.</li><li>NATO sensitivity: The incidents come as European countries remain on alert after previous unauthorized airspace intrusions, including during earlier phases of the war in Ukraine, leading Lithuania to coordinate closely with NATO partners on monitoring its skies.</li><li>Legal framework: The emergency situation designation gives Lithuanian agencies expanded powers for tasks such as quickly restricting access to certain areas near the border and accelerating technical responses, but stops short of martial law or mobilization measures.</li></ul><blockquote>We do not need war - Alexander Lukashenko</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Lithuanian government: Officials describe the balloons as a security risk that justifies an emergency situation, citing both the danger to civilian air traffic and the broader context of tensions on NATO’s eastern border.
