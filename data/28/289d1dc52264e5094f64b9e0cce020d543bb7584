A new rumor out of China today has sparked speculation that Apple may be readying a unique new iPhone 17 Pro color that somehow reflects the new design language of its iOS 26 software.<br/>

Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://t.co/nBP4VF7qri">Instant Digital</a> on Thursday hinted that the iPhone 17 Pro has a "special" color variant that is said to be "connected to the iOS 26 Liquid Glass design." <br/>
<br/>
The leaker, who only claims to have heard of it but not seen it, seems to believe that the color is what previous leaks have simply referred to as white, "but it appears differently depending on the lighting." <br/>
<br/>
While speculative, a white base material that subtly shifts hues depending on light and angle could add a dynamic, refractive quality to the color. Combined with the Liquid Glass UI aesthetic of iOS 26, a shimmering surface could potentially create a sense of motion or unity with the glassy elements of the software interface. <br/>
<br/>
The account Instant Digital has accurately leaked Apple information before, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">Yellow finish for the iPhone 14</a> and iPhone 14 Plus, and the<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-introduce-redesigned-milanese-loop/"> Apple Watch Ultra 2's Titanium Milanese Loop</a>. But its track record isn't perfect.<br/>
<br/>
On Wednesday, a <em>Macworld</em> report <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/all-new-iphone-17-and-17-pro-colors-leaked/">claimed</a> to reveal all of the colors that each iPhone 17 model will come in. Allegedly based on an "internal document," the report listed white as a color option for all models, including the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
Other colors that have now been rumored for the iPhone 17 Pro models by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/14/iphone-17-pro-all-new-color-rumored/">multiple</a> <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1945498931237970054">sources</a> include a new copper-like orange, black, gray, and dark blue. Whether Apple chooses different names for the colors it ultimately goes with remains to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
Curiously, the leaker Majin Bu recently <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1945498931237970054">shared images</a> of third-party lens covers purportedly reflecting Apple's iPhone 17 colors. A white color was not shown, but another, identified as "Transparent," appeared in its place. When asked why the transparent accessory is included in the images, Bu has equivocated, but the leaker has since <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-pro-new-colors-revealed/">alluded to another "surprise" color</a> that Apple is currently still testing, without giving anything else away.<br/>
<br/>
In a change to last year's all-titanium iPhone 16 Pro models, Apple is believed to be using a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/iphone-17-pro-dummies-highlight-apples-new-design/">part-glass, part-aluminum</a> design for the iPhone 17 Pro chassis. This could potentially usher in all-new color choices for Apple's high-end iPhone 17 models. What they look like in reality is something we'll learn in just a couple of months. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 series in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/liquid-glass-iphone-17-pro-color-ios-26-design/">Rumor Hints at &#039;Liquid Glass&#039; iPhone 17 Pro Color Tied to iOS 26 Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumor-hints-at-liquid-glass-iphone-17-pro-color-tied-to-ios-26-design.2461717/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
