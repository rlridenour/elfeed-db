<p>London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police arrested Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu in the Finsbury Park area after he was mistakenly released from prison earlier this week; officials say he is back in custody and will face removal proceedings . Kebatu had been sentenced in September to 12 months&#x27; imprisonment for sexually assaulting a woman and a 14-year-old girl and was subject to a five-year sexual harm prevention order, details that triggered public concern when he was freed in error . The case has prompted government attention and a vow from Prime Minister Keir Starmer to deport him following his re-arrest .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/o_WHgbseUipl4hIkxBKH2Y5LLLSrJ2TaT8ihoc5b2bf2EoJqRWkBef1JyzBxIw3I7yTZvhr1utIBdfqpx7KQ-EeEV42pXQkMqRh9U-XKrwsvZt6z0BKUBzhcv63VIA8_VHllf5v7eoW1Ei5yXgcLsM3nFfLjSuCG6IhDwZQznw' alt='Metropolitan police in north London after the re‑arrest of a man mistakenly released from prison' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Prison procedural probe: Officials say Kebatu was released in error from HMP Chelmsford and the mistake has prompted a government investigation into the circumstances of his discharge</li><li>Police search: Metropolitan police carried out a search that lasted nearly three days before locating and arresting him in the Finsbury Park area of north London</li><li>Local reaction: Kebatu&#x27;s original conviction earlier this year sparked weeks of protests in parts of Essex and increased local pressure on authorities over offender release controls</li><li>State response: Following the re-arrest, national leaders signalled a push for removal, with officials saying deportation will be sought once legal and custody steps are complete</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Metropolitan Police: Met officers said they located and detained the man in north London after a targeted operation following reports of his release .
