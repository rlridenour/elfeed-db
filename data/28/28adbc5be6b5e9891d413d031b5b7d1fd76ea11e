The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-announces-new-airtag/">new AirTag that Apple unveiled today</a> features a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, enabling the Precision Finding feature to work up to 50% farther away from an item compared to the previous AirTag, according to Apple. However, you need a compatible iPhone model in order to take advantage of this improvement.<br/>

The improved Precision Finding requires one of these iPhone models:<ul><br/>
  <li>iPhone 15</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 15 Plus</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 15 Pro</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 15 Pro Max</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16 Plus</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16 Pro</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16 Pro Max</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 17</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 17 Pro</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 17 Pro Max</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone Air</li><br/>
</ul>Precision Finding at longer distances is limited to the iPhone models listed above because both the AirTag and the iPhone need Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, which was introduced starting with the iPhone 15 series.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the lower-end iPhone 16e does not have a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip.<br/>
<br/>
Precision Finding at the previous distances is still supported on the iPhone 11 and newer.<br/>
<br/>
Precision Finding can lead you to the exact location of an item with an AirTag attached to it, by showing you a directional arrow and your distance away from the item on your iPhone's screen. Starting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-releases-watchos-26-2-1/">watchOS 26.2.1</a>, you can also use Precision Finding on an Apple Watch Series 9 and later or Apple Watch Ultra 2 and later to find an AirTag 2. <br/>
<br/>
Precision Finding on the Apple Watch does not work with the original AirTag.<br/>
<br/>
The new AirTag also has an upgraded Bluetooth chip for improved overall range outside of Precision Finding mode, with an iPhone 11 or newer.<br/>
<br/>
The new AirTag is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag">available to order on Apple.com</a> and in the Apple Store app starting today, and it will be available at Apple Store locations later this week. In the U.S., pricing remains set at &#36;29 for one AirTag and at &#36;99 for four.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/">AirTag</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/new-airtag-longer-precision-finding/">New AirTag&#039;s Improved Precision Finding Requires These iPhone Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-airtags-improved-precision-finding-requires-these-iphone-models.2476656/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
