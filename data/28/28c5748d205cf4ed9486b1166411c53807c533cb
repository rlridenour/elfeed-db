<li>I've been practising fretting less about homework.</li>
<li>I added an <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/on-this-day/">On this day</a> page to my blog. (<a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/03/on-this-day/">blog post about it</a>)</li>

I might be able to save time and just copy over the blog post during the first go-around, from make serve.</li>
<li>I added <a href="https://pagefind.app/">Pagefind</a> search to my blog.</li>
<li>I wrote about some of my <a href="https://sachachua.com/topic/workflows/">workflows</a>.</li>
<li>I started a <a href="https://sachachua.com/now">/now</a> page.</li>
<li>Oops: I forgot to check on Emacs Berlin and it turned out that the NAS timezone was set to GMT-5 instead of America/Toronto, so I scrambled to get it set up. I also got distracted while trying to figure out how to revoke the token the NAS was using so it wouldn't downscale automatically, so that might have wrapped up the meeting early. I set up cronjobs on xu4 for next time.</li>

Next week:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Continue to reduce fretting about homework.</li>
<li>Work through intermediate piano course in Simply Piano. Practise1 more songs, too.</li>
<li>Take a look at that inbox and start dusting things off.</li>

“One thing that really fascinates me is how I'm reminded of events and
readings that I'd completely forgotten &#x2013; but, once reminded, I find
that these things are once again in my mind. Perhaps I can say what I'm
thinking more clearly &#x2014; though I'm more than a little frustrated by
having absolutely no memory of experiencing or reading something I
describe in an entry written only a few years ago, I'm fascinated by how
reading what I wrote has brought that experience back to mind rather
vividly. Of course I'm reminded of what I described in the text that I'm
now re-reading, but I can also remember other things associated with
whatever it is that is described there. It's as though the small bit
that I wrote and can now read is the key that unlocks a much larger
trove of memory. Funny how the mind works.”

<p>
I am also quite fuzzy about things that happened, and I'm glad I've got
notes to help me sort of remember.

Following a link from <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-maya">https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-maya</a> , I enjoyed this quote about blogging:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Although, as well researched and as thoughtful as Houston might be
there's a messiness at work here that I love; it is the true great
quality of a blog. That permission to roam, to let your curiosity grab
you by the lapel and hoist you across fifteen different subjects over
the course of a single paragraph; blogging is pointing at things and
falling in love.

every now and then. Someone had a question about whether bull sharks are
obligate ram ventilators, so I did a little research and added whatever
notes I could find there. I think maybe they aren't, although they're
sometimes described as such? Not sure, maybe someone can chime in. =)</li>

Oooh, it could be fun to trawl through these for ideas for things to
port over to Emacs.

<p>
The Smartblocks plug-in for Roam Research is the system I personally
use to build these types of workflows. It offers a set of triggers,
variables, and commands you can chain together into fairly readable
statements like:
<code>&lt;%SET:topOfMindToday,&lt;%INPUT:What's on your mind today?%&gt;%&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;%RANDOMBLOCKFROM:Writing Ideas%&gt;</code>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Even with limited programming knowledge, many people in the community
have been able to fashion their own Smartblock flows. Plenty of them
have published their workflows to the community Github for others to
use.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Books are maps to territories that are completely internal to the
reader. By focusing so heavily on extracting the surface symbology of
the map itself, these process-heavy note-takers risk losing sight of the
territory. A book's territory is the reasoning and argument that the
book presents to you as a path you take through your own psyche. The
goal isn't to remember everything the book contains. Remembering a
book's contents is useless. The book exists to contain what it contains.
If the contents are important, you keep a copy of it for you to look
things up again.
</p>

<p>
But that isn't the point of reading. The purpose of reading is to be
changed. Sometimes the change is trivial and temporary &#x2013; a piece of
fiction that brings some joy in your life. Sometimes the change is
profound &#x2013; a shift in your perspective on life. “Action items” from a
book are external and forcing yourself to follow through on them is
exhausting.

<li><a href="https://social.sachachua.com/@sacha/statuses/01JQ7ZA1C4P0389SDJ0B9Y753C">Added Pagefind search (toot)</a>
I'm also experimenting with using <a href="https://pagefind.app/">Pagefind</a> to
provide search for my static site using client-side Javascript. It
currently analyzes 10934 files and indexes 8183 pages (87272 words) in
40 seconds. The data is 125MB, but a search for, say, "sketchnote"
transfers only 280KB, so that's pretty good. I think I'm adding the date
properly and I know I can set that as the default sort, but I haven't
yet figured out how to make it possible for people to sort by either
relevance or date as they want. I also want to eventually format the
search results to include the date. Maybe
