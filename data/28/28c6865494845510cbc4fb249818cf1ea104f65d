Apple is preparing to release another minor iOS 18 update for the iPhone, according to information shared by an anonymous leaker today in a post on X. The leaker has a private account, and they request that we do not link to their posts, but they have proven to be a reliable source for upcoming iOS versions.<br/>

Specifically, the leaker said they have seen evidence of iOS 18.6.2 with a build number of 22G100. However, in a private message, they said it is possible that the update will simply end up being a revised version of iOS 18.6.1.<br/>
<br/>
A similar situation played out last year, when the leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-preparing-ios-17-5-2/">said iOS 17.5.2 was in the pipeline</a>, but Apple ended up releasing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-releases-ipados-17-5-1-ipad-10/">revised iOS 17.5.1 build for the iPad 10</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/apple-releases-ios-18-6-1/">released last week</a>. Those software updates <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/blood-oxygen-monitoring-returning-to-apple-watch/">re-enabled the Blood Oxygen feature</a> on Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 models sold in the U.S., with calculations now happening on a paired iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the update coming would likely include bug fixes and/or security patches, or perhaps some minor tweaks to the re-enabled Blood Oxygen feature.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/another-ios-18-update-is-in-the-pipeline/">Another iOS 18 Update is Coming Soon, Says Leaker</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/another-ios-18-update-is-coming-soon-says-leaker.2463554/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
