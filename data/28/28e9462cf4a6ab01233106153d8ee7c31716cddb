<p>Gunmen stormed a girls’ boarding school in Maga, Kebbi State, Nigeria, in a pre-dawn raid on Monday, killing a staff member and taking 25 students from their hostel, authorities said. Police tactical units exchanged fire with the attackers, who were described as carrying &quot;sophisticated weapons,&quot; and the army has been called in to help search nearby forests for the abducted pupils. No group has claimed responsibility and officials did not report the motive; similar raids in the region are often linked to criminal gangs that demand ransoms, a pattern analysts and local media have highlighted.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/2chwFrnnph9bO1yxAXzN_Lfe2lSee4M8zByhKYLcQoJ08WIbzVLck0YjldxwLKmBep5YukPtmKef7Lkpnfhlp3hlVrS9o-npJ8n5vmU6mf_7wTSSH2vIFvu7BBL-n8Lgqh1VGFKiyejNaag' alt='File image used to illustrate school safety concerns after a raid on a Nigerian girls&#x27; boarding school (not the scene of the attack).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Method of entry: Reports say attackers scaled the school fence and seized students from the hostel during the pre-dawn raid, indicating a targeted operation on boarding facilities.</li><li>Weaponry described: Police described the assailants as carrying &quot;sophisticated weapons,&quot; a phrase used by authorities to stress the attackers&#x27; firepower and organization.</li><li>Human cost named: Local media identified the killed staff member as Hassan Makuku, and a school official said another staffer was wounded while resisting the attack.</li><li>Kidnapping pattern: Analysts note this raid fits a wider trend in northwestern Nigeria where criminal gangs abduct schoolchildren and frequently seek ransom payments, prolonging insecurity in the region.</li></ul><blockquote>Hassan Makuku was shot dead while Ali Shehu sustained an injury to his right hand. - Nigerian Police Force</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Nigerian Police: The attackers carried sophisticated weapons and engaged in sporadic shooting while fleeing with students, according to the police statement.
