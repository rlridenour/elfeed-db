<p>I’ll just say it. I think the default set of icons provided by Emacs are embarrassingly ugly. It’s a shame because I think a well designed tool bar is a genuinely useful user interface. I also suspect that a lot of the guidance to disable the tool bar is motivated more by aesthetic than functional reasons.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in keeping with the deeply configurable nature of Emacs, one can substitute said icons for better looking ones. That is what <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/calle24">Calle 24</a> does, a new package now available on <a href="https://melpa.org/#/calle24">MELPA</a> that substitutes the default tool bar icons with those from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/">SF Symbols</a>, a library of images provided by Apple to support apps made to run on their platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Calle 24</strong> also provides different icon sets for both light and dark mode appearances.</p>
<p>If you use Emacs for macOS, I invite you to give <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/calle24">Calle 24</a> a try.</p>
