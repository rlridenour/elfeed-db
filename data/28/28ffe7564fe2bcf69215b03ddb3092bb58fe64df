Although, as I have said, <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/08/01/emacs-carnival-2025-08-your-elevator-pitch-for-emacs/">the Emacs elevator pitch</a> is a difficult challenge, several people have stepped forward to meet it. Eric MacAdie is one of those people and has provided <a href="https://macadie.info/2025/08/26/emacs-carnival-elevator-pitch-and-post-pitch-talking-points/">his own contribution</a>. His approach is to offer some talking points for such a pitch without making an actual elevator pitch himself.

<p>
His points, it seems to me, are an excellent précis of what we love about Emacs and why we&rsquo;re still using it after other editors have come and gone. His post is well worth reading but here&rsquo;s a short summary of his points.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When you&rsquo;re starting, use a a cheat sheet. It&rsquo;s <i>not</i> a sign of weakness.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to learn everything at once. After you learn the basics you can start worrying about living your life in Emacs.</li>
<li>In Microsoft products, everything seems easy in the beginning but you soon reach a point where everything is hard. Emacs is just the opposite: at first things seem hard but you soon reach a point where you can do anything you want.</li>
<li>Emacs is older than the IBM CUA standards and has its own way of doing things. Instead of asking why Emacs doesn&rsquo;t follow the CUA standards, perhaps you should ask we everyone else isn&rsquo;t following the Emacs standards.</li>
<li>Most things in Emacs don&rsquo;t change. The things you learned 30 years ago still work. At the same time, Emacs continues to evolve and add new capabilities.</li>
<li>Completion. Completion is one of Emacs&rsquo; magical powers. You don&rsquo;t have to memorize the key chords for every command. Rather you can use <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> and an approximation of the command name to bring up list of candidates. Seventeen years on, I&rsquo;m still using this technique to find seldom used commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As I said, MacAdie&rsquo;s post is a good summary of reasons to use Emacs. Take a look and see if you don&rsquo;t agree.</p>
