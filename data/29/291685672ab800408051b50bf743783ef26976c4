<blockquote><p>
  Apple will introduce a redesigned Blood Oxygen feature for some Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 users through an iPhone and Apple Watch software update coming later today.</p>
<p>  Users with these models in the U.S. who currently do not have the Blood Oxygen feature will have access to the redesigned Blood Oxygen feature by updating their paired iPhone to iOS 18.6.1 and their Apple Watch to watchOS 11.6.1. Following this update, sensor data from the Blood Oxygen app on Apple Watch will be measured and calculated on the paired iPhone, and results can be viewed in the Respiratory section of the Health app. This update was enabled by a recent U.S. Customs ruling.

<p>This seems like a workaround to let Apple Watches released after <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/09/masimo-founder-resigns-as-ceo-after-removal-from-board/">Masimo</a> successfully brought a patent case against Apple and forced the company to deactivate the blood oxygen sensor on new U.S. Apple Watch models. The main difference seems to be that data will be recorded on the watch, but only displayed on the iPhone.</p>
<p>I’m still surprised that it’s gone this long and this far, but Apple seems to be a company that will leave no legal stone unturned and will fight to the end when it feels it’s in the right.</p>
