<p>On Tuesday, the cardinals locked themselves into the <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2025/05/take-a-3d-virtual-tour-of-the-sistine-chapel.html">Sistine Chapel</a>, officially beginning the conclave to elect the 267th pope. First formalized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_X">Pope Gregory X</a> in 1274, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_conclave">the conclave </a>(a word derived from the Latin words&nbsp;<i>cum clave</i>, meaning “with a key”) follows a highly scripted process honed over the past 800 years. How the conclave works, and how it came into being—all of that gets covered in the <em>Religion for Breakfast</em> video above. It’s hosted by the religious studies scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Mark_Henry">Dr. Andrew M. Henry</a>.</p>
<p>Below, you can also delve into the more recent history of papal elections. Created by <em>Useful Charts</em>, this video covers every papal conclave since 1958 and includes a prediction for who the next pope will be once the white smoke rises. Who is the next likely pontiff? No spoilers here. You’ll have to watch the video to find out.</p>
