Working with d3js I found myself in need of a tooltip to explicate data as it is explored in a chart. The best way to use d3 with Reagent (react.js) is to use reagent to handle the DOM manipulations and d3 to handle more elaborate visualizaion calculations. We don&rsquo;t follow the d3 model of adding an event to every dom element to trigger a tooltip item to be created, which duplication would behave poorly with React state maintenance.
