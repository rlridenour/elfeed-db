A couple of weeks ago, I wrote <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12919">about Charles Choi&rsquo;s Scrim beta</a>. Scrim is an app that makes the <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Protocols.html">Org Protocol</a> work in macOS. <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/announcing-scrim--an-org-protocol-proxy-for-emacs-on-macos.html">The problem, as Choi explains</a> is that Org Protocol depends on calling <code>emacsclient</code> to deliver the messages to Emacs. Unfortunately, this became impossible when Apple started sandboxing applications for security reasons.
</p>
<p>
Choi is a huge fan of Org Protocol so he he wrote <a href="http://yummymelon.com/scrim/">Scrim</a> to act as a native macOS client for Emacs server. That gets around the sandboxing and allows Org Protocol to work on macOS. Scrim is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scrim/id6744040981">on the App store</a> by itself or as a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app-bundle/id1810494622?mt=12">bundle</a> with the related app <a href="http://yummymelon.com/captee/">Captee</a> that allows sharing links from other applications via the share menu.
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;ve tried using Org Protocol before but could never get it to work. Now I understand why. If you too have tried and failed to get Org Protocol working, you can get Scrim and Captee for $7.99. That&rsquo;s a very reasonable price and since the two apps scratch one of Choi&rsquo;s itches, it&rsquo;s very likely that they&rsquo;ll be maintained on an ongoing basis.

<p>
Take a look at Choi&rsquo;s <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/announcing-scrim--an-org-protocol-proxy-for-emacs-on-macos.html">announcement</a> to see if Scrim might be helpful to you.</p>
