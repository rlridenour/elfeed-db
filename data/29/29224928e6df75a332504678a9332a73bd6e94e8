<p>Uganda’s main opposition figure, Bobi Wine, was reported by his National Unity Platform (NUP) to have been forcibly taken from his home in Kampala by security forces, with the party saying an army helicopter landed at his compound and flew him to an unknown location. Ugandan authorities rejected that account, with police and the army publicly denying that he was abducted or arrested. The competing claims came as early results indicated President Yoweri Museveni was heading toward another election win, while Wine challenged the credibility of the announced tallies.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Pf_sCesRJv8dcQOlB8XKCUnGWHEZAcwvFs3VavY48ODng9GjeL_yrXoqM10U0PcfsL0giPz8xRNPkZXNwWkM1sPcZSrCbxlFZ1QAYCC_QVEqYdKqTsqYX8jub_6Q6EtRtqL8LR4o3b2NSgXDt3KnSZTZP8RrMZIm4KHpT0jxniM9UaAK80suyGv_0fW8FZSN4fuV6BW8ATkh_PVqaaulXAl5NPAd-dvqwxr5XngKnnjkC9epFsJmJQnXUEi4VCgskEZ4cj45Ca721mFAHw' alt='Uganda&#x27;s security forces patrol a street during protests following the announcement of preliminary results in Kampala, Jan. 16, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Internet disruption: The reports unfolded during a nationwide internet blackout, which limited independent verification and communication by parties and supporters.</li><li>House arrest claim: Separate reporting said Wine was under house arrest, according to his party, as results began to come in.</li><li>Army statement: An army spokesperson, Chris Magezi, said rumors of Wine’s “so-called arrest” were “baseless and unfounded,” framing the episode as misinformation.</li><li>Violence allegation: Wine’s party alleged that security forces killed 10 of his campaigners in the hours surrounding the vote, adding to tensions around the results.</li><li>Street security: News photos and reporting described heightened security patrols in Kampala as preliminary results were announced and contested.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>National Unity Platform (opposition): NUP said an army helicopter landed at Wine’s compound and that he was forcibly taken to an unknown destination; in other accounts, the party said he was placed under house arrest as results emerged.
