TOT was formed by engineer Alvaro Lopez-Medrano, who patented a technology that manages "how power is used to respond to decreases and increases in the ratio of radio signal to interference." TOT does not manufacture any products, and it has also sued LG, Samsung, Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile.<br/>
<br/>
In the original filing in 2021, TOT said that it had approached Apple "and its suppliers of wireless baseband processors" to license TOT technology, but Apple and other companies "refused."<br/>
<br/>
Apple claimed that the TOT patents it was accused of infringing were invalid, but it was unable to prove that in court. TOT was seeking damages and ongoing royalties.<br/>
<br/>
Apple told <em>Reuters</em> that it is disappointed with the ruling and that it will appeal.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/">Patent Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/01/apple-patent-lawsuit-tot/">Apple Owes Spanish Company Over &#36;110 Million for Violating Wireless Patents</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-owes-spanish-company-over-110-million-for-violating-wireless-patents.2460020/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
