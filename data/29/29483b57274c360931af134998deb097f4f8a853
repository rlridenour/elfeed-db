Nomad today announced the launch of the <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/leather-mag-wallet-horween-black">Leather Mag Wallet</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, which includes an integrated Tracking Card that works with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> app.<br/>

The Leather Mag Wallet attaches to the back of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; using a magnetic connection, and it serves as an alternative to Apple's own Leather Wallet with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;. Nomad made the wallet from vegetable-tanned Horween leather that will develop a unique patina over time.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad's Mag Wallet is able to hold up to four standard credit cards, and it connects to &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; so if it comes off of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and is lost, it can be found with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app. &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network integration is included, so if you are out of range, it will be able to connect to Apple products owned by others to relay its location. &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; also includes features for playing a sound and getting a notification when the wallet is left behind.<br/>
<br/>
There is a rechargeable battery inside and the Mag Wallet can be charged using any Qi or &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger. The battery lasts for up to five months. The wallet can be attached to any &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; case, and it comes in black and brown colors.<br/>
