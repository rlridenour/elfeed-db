  <p>The details of how, when, and where Google would charge its
fees are complicated, and they seem to be somewhat tailored to
the needs of a game developer like Epic Games. Google can
charge 20 percent for an in-app purchase that provides “more
than a de minimis gameplay advantage,” for example, or 9
percent if the purchase does not. And while 9 percent sounds
like it’s also the cap for apps and in-app subscriptions sold
through Google Play, period, the proposal notes that that
amount doesn’t include Google’s cut for Play Billing if you buy
it through that payment system.</p>

<p>That cut will be 5 percent, Google spokesperson Dan Jackson tells
The Verge, confirming that “This new proposed model introduces a
new, lower fee structure for developers in the US and separates
the service fee from fees for using Google Play Billing.” (For
reference, <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622?hl=en">Google currently charges</a> 15 percent for
subscriptions, 15 percent of the first $1M of developer revenue
each year and 30 percent after that, though it also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23969690/google-spotify-android-billing-commission-secret-deal">cuts special
deals with some big developers</a>.)</p>

<p>If you use an alternative payment system, Google might still get a
cut: “the Google Play store is free to assess service fees on
transactions, including when developers elect to use alternative
billing mechanisms,” the proposal reads. But it sounds like that
may not happen in practice: “If the user chooses to pay through an
alternative billing system, the developer pays no billing fee to
Google,” Jackson tells The Verge.</p>

<p>According to the document, Google would theoretically even be able
to get its cut when you click out to an app developer’s website
and pay for the app there, as long as it happens within 24 hours.</p>

<p>This seems as clear as mud, other than being music to Epic Games’s ears.</p>
