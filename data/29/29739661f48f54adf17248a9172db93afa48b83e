<p>Alexander Pope made use of every scrap of paper that offered a clean surface &#8212; nearly the entire first draft of his translation of the <em>Iliad</em> was written on the backs of envelopes, bills, miscellaneous letters, and stray bits of paper. Jonathan Swift suggested that other writers might turn this to their advantage: They could print their own works in editions with wide margins, lend these to &#8220;paper-sparing Pope,&#8221; wait for him to fill in the spaces with poetry &#8212; and then sell this as their own.</p>
