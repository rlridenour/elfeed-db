<p>Someone pointed me to <a href="https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/">The TTY demystified</a> on Mastodon and I
appreciated the list of every signal that the kernel&rsquo;s terminal driver sends
processes (SIGWINCH, SIGPIPE, SIGCHLD, SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTSTP, SIGQUIT).
I thought <code>SIGWINCH</code> and <code>SIGHUP</code> were sent by the terminal emulator but they
aren&rsquo;t.</p>
