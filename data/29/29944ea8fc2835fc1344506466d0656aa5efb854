<p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/apple-ai-pin/">Via Juli Clover of MacRumors</a>, The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-developing-ai-wearable-pin">is reporting</a> that Apple is working on a “small, wearable AI pin with multiple cameras, a speaker, and microphones.” Clover’s summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The pin is said to be similar in size to an AirTag, with a thin, flat, circular disc shape. It has an aluminum and glass shell, and two cameras at the front. There is a standard lens and a wide-angle lens that are meant to capture photos and videos, while three microphones are designed to pick up sound around the wearer. An included speaker allows the pin to play audio, and there is a physical control button along one edge. The device is able to wirelessly charge like an Apple Watch.

<p>This is a report about an early prototype, not a product being prepped in the supply chain, so if it ever exists, it’ll be quite a while from now—and there’s a good chance it’ll never exist.</p>
<p>However, I think it’s interesting that Apple’s considering this product, because in many ways it fits with Apple’s product strategy. Sure, maybe in the future everyone will just wear AR glasses containing cameras and displays and audio output and an Internet connection. But it’s also possible that we’re headed for a more mix-and-match future with a constellation of smart devices that we wear in various contexts throughout our day. If you are someone who just has an iPhone in your pocket, it’s hidden away from the outside world… a problem rectified by wearing a small device with cameras and microphones on your shirt.</p>
<p>Does such a device fit in the future, or would it be pointless and redundant? It’s hard to say right now, but it certainly seems like something worth an investigation by Apple. I’d be shocked if Apple’s long-term wearables strategy isn’t based on offering a load of ancillary devices that leverage the iPhone’s computing power and cellular connectivity wherever possible.</p>
