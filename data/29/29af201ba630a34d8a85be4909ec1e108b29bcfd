<p>This remarkable phenomenon was discovered by Cambridge mathematician James Grime. Number five six-sided dice as follows:</p>
<p>A: 2, 2, 2, 7, 7, 7<br />
B: 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6<br />
C: 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5<br />
D: 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9<br />
E: 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8</p>
<p>Now, on average:</p>
<p>A beats B beats C beats D beats E beats A</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>A beats C beats E beats B beats D beats A.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though, if each die is rolled twice rather than once, then the first of the two chains above remains unchanged except that D now beats C &#8212; and the second chain is reversed:</p>
<p>A beats D beats B beats E beats C beats A.</p>
<p>As a result, if each of two opponents chooses one of the five dice, a third opponent can always find a remaining die that beats them both (so long as he&#8217;s allowed to choose whether the dice will be rolled once or twice).</p>
