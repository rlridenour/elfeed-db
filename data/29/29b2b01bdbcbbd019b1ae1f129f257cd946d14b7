Apple's long-rumored "homeOS" operating system might finally be on the horizon, based on recent trademark activity reviewed by <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>

An apparent shell company known as Home Operations Suite LLC has submitted trademark applications for "HOMEOS" in a handful of countries in recent months. A priority filing was made <a href="https://www.tmdn.org/tmview/#/tmview/detail/LI500000000020671">in Liechtenstein</a> in October 2024, and additional filings were made <a href="https://www.tmdn.org/tmview/#/tmview/detail/US500000099140347">in the United States</a>, Argentina, Peru, and a few other countries in April this year.<br/>
<br/>
The trademark is now registered in Liechtenstein, but the applications are still pending elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
The trademark filing in the U.S. was first spotted by <a href="https://www.parkerortolani.com/">Parker Ortolani</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/05/apples-new-homeos-might-debut-next-week-at-wwdc/">reported by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
There is no definitive proof that Apple owns the shell company, but it has a history of creating limited-liability companies with generic names in order to discreetly move to protect its intellectual property related to unannounced products.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in May 2023, <em>MacRumors</em> <a href="https://x.com/rsgnl/status/1663956592990060544">uncovered a "VisionOS" trademark application</a> filed by another secretive LLC shell company. A month later, at WWDC, Apple announced its Vision Pro headset and its visionOS operating system.<br/>
<br/>
"homeOS" has been referenced in various other places in the past, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/apple-refers-to-homeos-job-listings/">in Apple job listings</a>, and in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/tvos-17-4-homeos-mention/">tvOS 17.4 code discovered by <em>MacRumors</em></a>. It could end up being the name of the software platform that powers Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">long-rumored smart home hub</a>, which has been described as a HomePod with a screen. The device will reportedly have a square iPad-like screen that can be attached to a speaker base or mounted on a wall.<br/>
<br/>
The hub would allow users to control smart home accessories, make FaceTime video calls, use Apple's intercom feature between rooms in a house, and more. It might even double as a home security system with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-smart-home-camera-rumor/">Apple-designed smart home camera</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In March, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the HomePod with a screen would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/homepod-with-screen-after-wwdc-kuo/">enter mass production in the third quarter of 2025</a>, but it is unclear if it will ship to customers this year or next year. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">delayed the personalized Siri features</a> that are expected to be at the core of the device, so perhaps next year is a safer bet at this point. However, Apple could still provide an early preview of the home hub at any point now, and its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/">WWDC 2025 keynote</a> just so happens to be coming up next week.
