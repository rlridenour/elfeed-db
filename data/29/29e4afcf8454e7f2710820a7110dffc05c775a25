It is finals week here at Oklahoma Baptist University. Here is a prayer for students:
</p>

 <p>
Dear students,
</p>

 <p>
May God calm your anxieties, <br></br>
refresh your minds, <br></br>
and honor the faithfulness <br></br>
you have shown this semester.
</p>

 <p>
Remember that God has gifted you <br></br>
more than you can imagine, <br></br>
and you are capable of more <br></br>
than you’ve ever dreamed.
</p>

 <p>
May the great wisdom of the Father, <br></br>
the incomparable love of the Son, <br></br>
and the mighty power of the Spirit <br></br>
be with you all this week.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
