<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key Features of Timing</h2>

<li><strong>Automatic Tracking:</strong> No need to remember to start or stop timers. Timing automatically logs your activities, capturing every detail without manual intervention.</li>



<li><strong>Detailed Insights:</strong> Review precise data on the duration spent on specific applications, documents, or websites. For instance, distinguish between time dedicated to a client proposal in Word versus casual browsing on retail sites.</li>



<li><strong>AI-Powered Summaries:</strong> Leverage artificial intelligence to receive concise summaries of your daily activities, helping you quickly grasp where your time goes without sifting through extensive logs.</li>



<li><strong>Team Functionality:</strong> Timing also has teams support. Collaborate effortlessly by sharing projects, while managers can view aggregated time reports. Importantly, individual privacy is respected, as only manual time entries are visible to supervisors, ensuring a non-intrusive tracking environment.</li>
