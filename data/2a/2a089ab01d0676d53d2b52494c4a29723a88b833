<p>It has been a while since my <a href="https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/exploring-desktop-linux-p2/">last post in this series</a>. I have been pretty busy with work, but pottering with tweaking my Linux setup in the meantime. At some point, I will likely publish my dotfiles, but I am going back and forth so much on things at the moment that dotfiles would only be a transient snapshot of the way things are right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still in Hyprland, but this time I have swapped out my status bar and moved away from <a href="https://www.ml4w.com">ML4W</a> as I have added more of my own configuration. I&rsquo;ve also temporarily stepped away from Emacs while my brain adapts to switching between Linux and macOS shortcuts, and found a few new CLI apps that I really love.</p>

<p>Playing with Hyprland continues to be great fun. I really enjoy the snappiness of it, and moving between windows, apps and workspaces with the keyboard alone is a joy. Last time, I had swapped Waybar with <a href="https://aylur.github.io/ags-docs/">ags</a> to provide a status bar. I liked it, but hit a few snags configuring it to my liking. It was nothing major, but &mdash; as I am in the exploratory phase with this at the moment &mdash; I am trying out all sorts of set-ups to see which I like best. In my wanderings, I came across <a href="https://github.com/JakeStanger/ironbar">Ironbar</a>, which (as the name hints) is written in the programming language of the hour, Rust. I managed to get it up and running quickly, and found styling and tweaking the widgets reasonably easy.</p>

<p>I like the set of minimal info I have up there now. From the left-hand side of the screen, I have numbers representing my occupied workspaces (i.e. workspaces that have windows in them). The current one is styled with a larger oval and a lighter grey background so that it stands out. Previously, I&rsquo;ve been showing all workspaces, or just showing them as unmarked blobs, but since I use numbers in the shortcuts to move to or move a window to a workspace, having the numbers there helps a lot. After that, I have the focused window name with the app&rsquo;s icon, then on the right side, I have widgets for current volume, Arch packages ready for updates, CPU and RAM used, connected <a href="https://github.com/JakeStanger/ironbar/discussions/614">Bluetooth</a> devices and their battery level, network connection, date and time, and a button to bring up a rofi window to choose whether to lock the screen, logout, reboot, power off etc. In the central spot, if <code>ncmpcpp</code> is running, it shows a widget with the current track name and artist, and when clicked, pops up a player widget with album art. When <code>ncmpcpp</code> is stopped, it removes the widget for a sleek look. I have configured most of the widgets to pop up something useful or launch an app when clicked.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still using Harmonoid as a more immersive playing experience, or to browse my music collection to find something to play, but the efficiency of <code>ncmpcpp</code> has grown on me, especially if I want to put together a playlist to play in the background. I think this is part of my growing appreciation of the ease of popping up a terminal window, launching some CLI app to do something quick, then closing the app and window with a keystroke and getting on with what you were doing.</p>
<p>In other Hyprland moves, I have removed the UI animations. I liked them, but turned them off experimentally, and found that I enjoyed the expreience more without them, as everything feels faster. I still use rofi for presenting interactive widgets for various things (like the logout menu I mentioned above), but I am trying out <a href="https://ulauncher.io">ULauncher</a> which has a very familiar &lsquo;Alfred-like&rsquo; UI, and some useful extensions. I would prefer the entry window to stay anchored and to expand the list down as you type, rather than keeping the whole list centered on the screen, but that&rsquo;s a minor thing, and may be a configuration option I haven&rsquo;t found yet. Or I may go back to rofi&hellip;</p>
<p>I no longer use a tray widget in the status bar to show minimised applications. I honestly didn&rsquo;t find it that useful, and sometimes found that the tray disappeared and took the apps with it when I disconnected and reconnected my Thunderbolt monitor. Instead, I use a plugin called <a href="https://github.com/hyprland-community/pyprland">Pyprland</a>, which &mdash; among other useful things &mdash; enables you to use &lsquo;scratchpads&rsquo;. Essentially, you can define certain apps that you want to be able to popup or hide on any workspace with a keystroke, and they float over your other apps in a defined position. This is really handy for apps like 1Password which you pop up and then dismiss when you have the info you need. I have found that it works much more predictably and reliably than tray widgets.</p>
<h3 id="web-email-and-todos">Web, email and todos</h3>
<p>In theory, I didn&rsquo;t need to find a new email client, because I was using Hey.com email, and their client uses Electron, so works cross-platform. I could also have switched to Firefox on Linux, which is well supported. However, I have ended up switching to <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> for browsing (which is incredibly powerful and flexible, but lightweight on resources), and moving back to <a href="https://www.fastmail.com">Fastmail</a> for email, calendars and contacts. I have cancelled my Hey.com account. I liked Hey, and appreciated that they were doing something different with email, but found that I didn&rsquo;t really use the features that are unique to their service, and worried a bit about being locked in to a non-standard email service. I realised that I could move my stuff back to Fastmail and get custom domain email handling for less than half the amount I was paying Hey.</p>
<p>I could have used any number of native email clients with Fastmail as it is a standard IMAP/CalDAV/CardDAV service, but having used their web app (which gives access to mail, calendars and contacts), I found that I liked it and didn&rsquo;t need anything else. There are plenty of keyboard shortcuts and it&rsquo;s attractive to look at. I made a single site app using Vivaldi, so I can launch it as a separate client, which works fine. I subscribe (read only) to my work Outlook calendar with it, and it works so much more reliably and smoothly than it ever did with Apple iCloud calendars. I use Fastmail&rsquo;s own app on iOS. It&rsquo;s a bit ironic that I have ended up using their clients when my worry with Hey was about lock-in, but I am using <a href="https://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/">vdirsyncer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pimutils/khal">khal</a> to pull down and create text versions of my appointments which is handy for widgets, and I may set up Emacs with notmuch to sync with my email at some point too. I have options, which is the main thing.</p>
<p>My todo setup is currently more in flux. I did indeed go down the Emacs org-mode rabbit hole for managing todos, as I foretold last time. It&rsquo;s not my first journey down that particular rabbit hole, and I am sure will not be my last, but once again, I found it a bit too intensive on the care and management of the system, rather than the actual Doing Of Things. At the moment, I have moved my repeating chores to the iOS app Due, and am trying out (again, not my first time) <a href="https://taskwarrior.org">Taskwarrior</a>. I like it. I think I could find a way of making it work well for the scheduling-based system that I prefer to use, and I like the fact that I can pop it up in a terminal. The one downside is that I haven&rsquo;t yet found a good way to access things when mobile, though I can ssh into my Linux box using Blink shell on iOS and look at my todos that way. This one is definitely ongoing.</p>
<h3 id="yazi">yazi</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried a lot of GTK/Qt based graphical file managers, and I&rsquo;m not in love with any of them. They are ok, they do the job, but I find that each has aspects that I find a bit irritating. Then I came across <a href="https://yazi-rs.github.io">yazi</a>, a CLI file manager, written in Rust (as many apps seem to be these days&hellip;). I absolutely love it. It&rsquo;s really fast, uses Vim keybindings, shows previews of the contents of many kinds of files (including images and PDFs), and integrates with <code>zoxide</code>, which I am already using to jump around frequently visited directories. I haven&rsquo;t done much configuration of it yet beyond changing the theme to Catppuccin, but it works very well out of the box.</p>
<p>Using yazi prompted my return to using <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a> as my terminal, as I found it easier to configure the font rendering and integration with Nerd Font symbols than on <a href="https://github.com/DanteAlighierin/foot">foot</a> which I had been trying on Linux. foot is nice too, and has some interesting features, but I am familiar with setting up kitty on macOS, so getting things how I wanted them was a little easier.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-shortcut-confusion">Keyboard shortcut confusion</h3>
<p>This brings me to one of the challenges I have faced switching daily between macOS and Linux: differences in core keyboard shortcuts. On macOS, the main modifier for most shortcuts is obviously Command (Super or Win on Linux), while Control is the counterpart on Linux. Working against my very long muscle memory of Cmd+s for save, Cmd+c for copy and so on, and remembering which I should be using on the computer in front of me is a challenge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried several strategies, but currently, I have a two-part approach. First, I remapped my modifier keys on my homerow mods so that Shift is on the index finger, Control (not Command) is on the middle, Option/Alt on my ring finger, and Command on my little finger. This is mirrored on both sides of the keyboard (a new keyboard actually, but that&rsquo;s a story for another time!). Then, on macOS only, and only for the external keyboard, I switch the Command and Control keys in the system settings. In effect, this means that for the main shortcuts, I can use the same keys and fingers on both macOS and Linux, but the combo issues, say Ctrl+s on Linux and Cmd+s on macOS.</p>
<p>However, fixing this created another problem on Emacs. Emacs obviously goes its own sweet way with keybindings, so that Control is a major prefix for bindings (with Meta/Alt/Option) on both platforms. That means that the same binding means hitting <em>different</em> keys on each system, and that has been one too many things for my poor old brain to assimilate right now. For now, I have moved back to using only Neovim for writing and coding, and I will try to think if there is some clever way out of the keybinding issue.</p>
<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h3>
<p>I am still loving this exploration, and enjoying Linux more the more I use it. There have been moments of frustration (often when trying to fix minor, essentially cosmetic issues that I should have really left alone), but generally I am still having enormous fun crafting my own computing experience. I find it quite telling that if I have to switch my monitor over to my Mac mini quickly to check something there (just moving one cable, so not a difficult process), I feel quite reluctant to have to deal with macOS again, and want to stay on the Linux box.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably too soon to say, but I really think I might be looking at switching completely for home use. That&rsquo;s quite something after more than 30 years as a Mac-only person.</p>
