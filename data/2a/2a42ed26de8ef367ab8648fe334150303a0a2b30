<p>As my emacs keybindings journey continues to evolve and to delete more efficiently with delete word it has lead to an interesting issue for me.</p>

<p>Typically, especially in my coding life I will typically copy a string to the clipboard, then go in and delete the target area and insert from the clipboard/kill-ring.  Now I have moved from deleting with the delete key to the the M-delete-word concept it seems that deleting words automatically puts this to the clipboard/kill-ring, so when I paste in my original copy it pastes back in the last killed words.</p>
<p>Generally I only ever use kill-line when I want a kill to be copied to the kill-ring and I only ever use the word deletion to just delete in preparation for a yank.</p>
<p>A bit of hunting around on the Interwebs lead to the definition of two new functions to be remapped to avoid the kill-ring.</p>
