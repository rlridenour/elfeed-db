<p>I posted this update a bit ago, but it’s worth making a separate post so you don’t miss it if you read the original post before I added the update:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It goes without saying that any consumer survey is only as good as
the surveyor. But CIRP, in particular, has posted some dubious
ones, to say the least. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@lapcatsoftware/114638324316925437">Jeff Johnson pointed out on Mastodon</a>
that back in 2023, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/09/apples-most-popular-mac/">CIRP published a survey that claimed the Mac
Pro accounted for 43 percent</a> of all Mac desktop sales, with
the Mac Mini and Mac Studio each accounting for only 4 percent
each. That’s just bananas. That’s not like <em>maybe wrong</em>, that’s
not <em>gotta be a little wrong</em>, that’s <em>how could anyone publish
this?</em> wrong. It’s hard to believe anything from CIRP after they
published that.</p>
