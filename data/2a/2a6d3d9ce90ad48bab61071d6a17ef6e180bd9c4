<p>President Trump signed an executive order declaring a U.S. “national emergency” related to Cuba and warning that the United States may impose tariffs on imports from countries judged to be supplying oil to the island. The step is framed as a way to increase the external cost of keeping Cuba’s fuel lifeline open as Washington seeks to intensify pressure on Havana’s communist government. The announcement lands as Cuba faces a worsening energy crunch: multiple outlets describe limited fuel availability and prolonged power cuts, raising concerns that tighter fuel flows could deepen hardship for ordinary Cubans. Mexico, which could be affected by the policy, said it would pursue diplomatic options and look for alternatives to help Cuba, while Cuban leaders denounced the U.S. move as an attempt to choke the island’s economy and worsen living conditions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/pDOFlqk90OxeeradCv-G9gZakDGWMNirG8U_ktXb0UNaOC5QoMmLVYLg6oHoC6KiMPKs_DTqslzmH99FyX-GEPOQ3j9v9iW1z21JX7strGPQqmGdnfPiXQTGTql3tVe98n6NFPy_LxeePIIZ9u2RWXUn3peKSx9pUHYoz7lzYciO7JVucKUBeGH4ndUedU-JcW6gwDw7RTZ5YpeHgobd-q-40TaJ0X2ejNQTFYr4rzHUHkTiNBVMNC6ETQ' alt='Reporting describes Cuba facing deeper blackouts as fuel supplies tighten.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Mexico’s warning: Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum warned the tariff threat could trigger a humanitarian crisis on the island and said Mexico would seek a diplomatic solution and alternatives to help Cuba.</li><li>Cuba’s response: Cuba’s leadership condemned the order, with President Miguel Díaz-Canel describing it as an effort to “suffocate” the economy and Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez calling it a “brutal act of aggression” against Cubans.</li><li>Fuel horizon: Some reporting estimates Cuba has roughly two to three weeks of oil on hand, while lengthy blackouts have become common in parts of the country.</li><li>Pressure mechanism: The executive order is described as creating a deterrent by tying third-country oil shipments to possible U.S. tariffs on those countries’ exports to the U.S. market.</li><li>Trump’s remarks: In separate comments reported alongside the order, President Trump said Cuba “will not be able to survive,” underscoring the administration’s stated goal of increasing pressure on Havana.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. administration: The order declares a national emergency regarding Cuba and sets up potential tariffs on countries seen as supplying oil, as part of a strategy to intensify pressure on Havana.
