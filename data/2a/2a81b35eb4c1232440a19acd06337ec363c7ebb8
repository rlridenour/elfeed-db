<p>Apple recently posted a white paper called&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/Helping-Protect-Kids-Online-2025.pdf"><em>Helping Protect Kids Online</em></a>, where, among other things, they disclosed an upcoming software update that will make it easier to set up child accounts and provide age ranges to developers. I am sure part of the reason for this is pending legislation making platform owners and software developers more responsible for keeping kids out of apps they shouldn&#8217;t be in.</p>



<p>The dangers of social media for children are well documented in Jonathan Haidt&#8217;s book,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jonathanhaidt.com/"><em>The Anxious Generation</em></a>. Haidt dives deep into how social media has contributed to rising anxiety and mental health struggles among young people. I&#8217;d recommend anybody interested in this topic give that book a read.</p>



<p>Social media companies have been doing a lot of finger-pointing at Apple and Google, arguing that platform owners should be responsible for ensuring that children don&#8217;t access inappropriate apps. Their claim is that the platform owner is in the best position to determine the age of the user. I&#8217;d agree with that.</p>



<p>However, I don&#8217;t think platform owners are exclusively responsible for fixing this problem. Indeed, part of me thinks that Facebook had better be careful what it wishes for. If Apple goes through with this update — and I fully expect them to — we will have a reliable age verification system on these devices. That means companies like Meta will have no excuse to claim they didn&#8217;t know children were using their applications.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m generally very privacy-sensitive, but in this case, I think the trade-off is worth it. Yes, Apple and app developers will know your age range, but at least we&#8217;ll have a system in place to help avoid the problems outlined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jonathanhaidt.com/"><em>The Anxious Generation.</em></a>&nbsp;I&#8217;m glad Apple is taking steps in this regard. But this isn&#8217;t just Apple&#8217;s responsibility. Other participants in this (specifically, social media companies and parents) need to do their part as well.</p>



<p>For parents, this is a good reminder to take an active role in your child&#8217;s online experience. With Apple making it easier to set up child accounts and manage access, now is the time to familiarize yourself with these tools. Technology can help, but ultimately, it&#8217;s a combination of smart tools and engaged parenting that will make the biggest difference.</p>
