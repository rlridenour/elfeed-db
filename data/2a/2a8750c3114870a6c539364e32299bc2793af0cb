<p>If asked to name our favorite French composer of the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, most of us would reach straight for Erik Satie, being able to bring to mind only <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2019/08/animated-scores-of-eric-saties-most-famous-pieces.html">his most famous pieces</a>, the <em>Gymnopédies </em>and perhaps the <em>Gnossiennes</em>. We may not know that those works all date from the same few years of his career between the late eighteen-eighties and the early nineties. They also represent only a small portion indeed of his artistic output, which includes a great deal of instrumental and vocal music as well as compositions for dramatic works, written between 1886 and his death in 1925 — the coming hundredth anniversary of which is being celebrated with the recording of newly discovered pieces.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/26/unheard-works-by-erik-satie-to-premiere-100-years-after-his-death">As the&nbsp;<em>Guardian</em>’s Dalya Alberge writes</a>, these “twenty-seven previously unheard works by Erik Satie, from playful cabaret songs to minimalist nocturnes” have been “painstakingly pieced together from hundreds of small notebooks,” most of them written “in the bohemian bistros of Montmartre in Paris where Satie worked as a pianist.”</p>

<p>Their rediscovery owes to the efforts of two composers, James Nye and Sato Matsui, who “tracked down the lost material in various archival collections, including the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.” They’ve now been recorded by pianist Alexandre Tharaud, and you can hear the resulting album, <em>Satie: Discoveries</em>, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kuFyuH6tvOjqf-ugVZ1RXulJtFUqnDPz0">the Youtube playlist at the top of the post</a>.</p>

Famous in his native France and elsewhere, Tharaud’s professional involvement with the work of his esteemed predecessor and countryman goes back to at least 2009, when he organized a Satie Day at Paris’ Cité de la Musique. That same year, he recorded Satie’s 1915 compositions <em>Avant-dernières Pensées</em>, or “Penultimate Thoughts. Once dismissed as minor, even by the composer’s enthusiasts, the <em>Avant-dernières Pensées</em> have since risen in status to become some of his most often performed later works. With the 27 short pieces that constitute <em>Discoveries</em>, Tharaud’s challenge wasn’t to come up with a fresh reinterpretation, but the very first interpretation any of us will ever have heard, leaving it to the next century of pianists to put their own spins on them.</p>
