For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2FAstropad%2Fpage%2F7A0D4682-3671-4F59-A263-926917F2940E">Astropad</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> and one of Astropad's <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0G6GRGCLW">anti-reflective Fresh Coat screen protectors</a> to go along with it.<br/>

Fresh Coat is a new kind of screen protector that Astropad designed with an optical-grade anti-reflective coating to reduce glare and provide a better <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> viewing experience. The technology that Astropad is using cuts reflections by 75 percent, while improving contrast and keeping colors vibrant. Unlike other anti-reflective screen protectors on the market, Fresh Coat has adds no haze or distortion.<br/>

<a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0G6GRGCLW">Priced at &#36;30</a>, Fresh Coat is made from a scratch-proof tempered glass that also provides protection for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display in addition to cutting down on glare and reflections. It's slim and won't add any bulk to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; even though there are five layers of technology at work. From the top down, there's an anti-reflective coating, an oleophobic and hydrophobic coating, a layer of tempered glass, a dust barrier, and an impact-resistant "airbag" bonding.<br/>

If you have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, it comes with an anti-reflective coating added by Apple. What you might not know, though, is that you can't use just any screen protector with the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. If you put a regular screen protector without an anti-reflective coating on, it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/iphone-17-screen-protector-anti-reflective-issue/">nullifies</a> the anti-reflective properties of that added coating.<br/>

Since Fresh Coat has its own anti-reflective coating, it actually improves upon Apple's included anti-reflective layer, reducing glare even further. With Fresh Coat, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s screen is easy to see in any lighting conditions, there's less eye strain, and if you use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a>, it looks even darker.<br/>

If you don't have an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, Fresh Coat can provide an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17-style display upgrade, mirroring Apple's own reflection-reducing display coating. Fresh Coat is available for all &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro and Pro Max, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15 Pro and Pro Max.<br/>
