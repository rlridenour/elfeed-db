<li><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/sticking-with-it" target="_blank">Sticking with it – Manu</a>. Manuel “Manu” Moreale writes about sticking to the tools he uses. The continued use of a product for a long stretch of time makes it possible for you to know the innards of the tool. Using the tool becomes second nature to you. The keyboard commands embed themselves into your muscles. The experience becomes fulfilling and productive.</li>

So have no use for this product. But if you are using a non-mechanical keyboard, Thock will bring some background noise to help you concentrate and write.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/i-deleted-my-second-brain" target="_blank">I Deleted My Second Brain</a>. This article got a fair amount of attention. I think the core issue around note-taking that needs to be discussed is the “why?” behind the activity. Why are we taking notes? What is the goal? What do we expect to be the fruits of this activity? For me, I take notes to think things through. Writing the note clarifies my thinking. So the goal is to think better. My notes show the progression of my thinking. That be itself is useful to me. So I can’t envision a scenario where I get rid of all of my notes.</li>
