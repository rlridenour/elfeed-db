<p>A US federal judge in Virginia has thrown out criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James after finding that the Trump‑selected prosecutor who brought the indictments was installed in violation of federal law and the US Constitution’s appointments clause. Judge Cameron McGowan Currie ruled that interim US attorney Lindsey Halligan, previously a personal lawyer to President Trump, lacked legal authority to act as a federal prosecutor, so every step she took in the cases must be set aside. The Justice Department under Attorney General Pam Bondi says it will appeal, meaning higher courts will now weigh in on the limits of presidential power to install loyalists in prosecutorial roles. For Comey and James—both frequent critics of the President—the decisions are a legal victory and a reminder that procedural checks can still constrain politically charged prosecutions, even amid fierce polarization.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/FExS634oLxECzprBM1l7u0mh1AsSGRPBoRtuWNIujiUTj4-yFa5bu5E_nD2K_iTG87xwHxRs64MufgtX4IfpeWradRNqhXfWSK1mk6kUzEiqaIjfwqDh8L3cdk5sJbSk-ZEtotegCW6KFxXpqpZKe7CxkcnStmZMgkjqftScjZXQnHVIczdNXSd8ovSLWsaIlcPBlYRywb21Rpf4nAYkHDHqbbNkb0HTBNBgIPULKiKgeZdO_y9eAN9-omp3Ai3rBqGSJXgForSCxLY9FQ' alt='James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose Trump‑backed federal indictments were dismissed over an unlawful prosecutor appointment.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Illegal appointment: Judge Currie concluded that Lindsey Halligan’s appointment as interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia violated federal statutes and the Constitution’s appointments clause, rendering all of her official actions invalid in both prosecutions.</li><li>Prior prosecutor’s stance: The previous Senate‑confirmed US attorney declined to bring charges against either Comey or Letitia James, citing insufficient credible evidence before Halligan later secured the indictments at the administration’s urging.</li><li>Public opinion context: Polling cited by US media reports indicated that more than half of Americans viewed the prosecutions of Comey and Letitia James as unjustified, suggesting widespread concern about politically driven cases.</li><li>Statements from defendants: Comey called the case against him &quot;a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence,&quot; while James described the dismissals as a &quot;victory&quot; and thanked supporters who had backed her during the proceedings.</li><li>Appeal and next steps: Attorney General Pam Bondi pledged to &quot;take all available legal action&quot; to reinstate the prosecutions on appeal, while some reports note that prosecutors could theoretically seek new indictments using a lawfully appointed US attorney.</li></ul><blockquote>I’m grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence - James Comey</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Judge Cameron McGowan Currie: Currie wrote that all actions taken by Lindsey Halligan, including securing James Comey’s indictment, were &quot;unlawful exercises of executive power&quot; that must be set aside because Halligan’s installation as interim US attorney was constitutionally defective.
