Problem: my MCRON process stops and I don&rsquo;t know how to check/restart it Sometimes, usually after coming back from suspend or starting a new session without rebooting, my &ldquo;check mail every 5 minutes&rdquo; mcron has stopped running and I have to execute the script manually. Does anyone know why it might stop, and how I can check if it&rsquo;s running right now? I attempted to start it as follows, but I get a strange cannot read error.
