<p>The world’s most famous organ piece, played on the world’s largest fully functioning pipe organ. That’s what you have above. Here, organist <a href="https://www.dylandavidshaw.com/bio">Dylan David Shaw</a> performs Bach’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnuq9PXbywA">Toccata and Fugue in D minor</a> on the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanamaker_Organ">Wanamaker organ</a>.</p>
<p>Originally built for the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904, the organ ended up in Philadelphia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanamaker%27s">Wanamaker’s department store</a> in 1911. More than a century later, the organ still resides in the same store. But Macy’s eventually took over Wanamaker’s, and Macy’s now plans to close the store, leaving <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2025/03/05/wanamaker-organ-macys-closing-philadelphia/">the fate of the organ unknown</a>. Where will the 28,000-pipe organ find a new home? That’s still TBD, something that’s&nbsp;likely to get resolved in the months to come.</p>
