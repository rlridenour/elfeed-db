<p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) opens this week in Davos, Switzerland, with President Donald Trump scheduled to attend as global leaders and executives discuss geopolitics, trade, and fast-moving technologies such as artificial intelligence. Several outlets describe Trump’s expected presence as a central storyline, with attendees weighing how US policy choices could reshape alliances, security arrangements and economic planning, especially for Europe. The meeting’s official theme emphasizes dialogue, and multiple reports frame the gathering as a test of whether governments and businesses can still find workable cooperation amid sharper global tensions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/t6qC0OJAWnZCSb3eTfMEGBeoFI7TzWqyWfpFCbJQyR4ZhYkc4wjCP4dkiqCpryaGp8fdP1Ti5rYwVcQQZtFMM906frS7txNxjl_gMqTWo2mhkzKUYwCc4BhRiF5qeIttI5NA8aEWfU8qIR7lnBJMA8jVRVfdkGp23hwAXM7E3g' alt='Davos hosts the annual World Economic Forum as leaders and executives arrive.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Street protests: Hundreds demonstrated in Davos against the WEF and Trump’s planned appearance, and protesters criticized Swiss authorities for how the event is handled.</li><li>US footprint: WEF President and CEO Børge Brende said he coordinated with the White House and expects a large US delegation, including five Cabinet secretaries, alongside President Trump.</li><li>Agenda shift: Politico reports that climate and diversity have slipped down Davos’ agenda while AI and growth have risen in prominence, reflecting how organizers and attendees are recalibrating priorities.</li><li>China messaging: China plans to use Davos to present itself as a supporter of cooperation and multilateralism, while still facing questions over trade practices, supply chains and fair competition.</li><li>Elite unease: AP/ABC reports the Davos opening comes amid heightened public unease about inequality, sharpening the contrast between the conference’s elite setting and broader social concerns.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>World Economic Forum leadership: WEF chief Børge Brende presents President Trump’s attendance and a large US delegation as a boost to Davos’ relevance and a sign of strong engagement with Washington.
