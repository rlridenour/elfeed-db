<p id="p1">I constantly see articles or videos proclaiming that iPhones are better than traditional cameras or that traditional cameras will always be superior to the iPhone&rsquo;s camera system. So it&rsquo;s great to see a measured opinion &ndash; with plenty of comparisons &ndash; from someone who clearly loves shooting with both pieces of hardware.</p>
<p id="p2">That&rsquo;s exactly what designer and creator Oliur has done with his latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv0bPa42m0" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> and <a href="https://www.oliur.com/iphone-vs-2000-pro-camera" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>.</p>

  I took the new iPhone 17 Pro and the Fujifilm X100VI out with me, shot the same scenes, edited everything the same way I normally do, and then mixed them up to see whether anyone could guess which was which.</p>
<p>  Some of the results genuinely surprised me.</p>
<p>  I originally posted the challenge on X to see who could figure out which camera was which, and out of all the comments, only one person got them all right.

<p id="p4">What&rsquo;s striking is how, despite the Fuji camera&rsquo;s evident technical prowess, it&rsquo;s not so simple:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  Technically, the Fuji should win. But in real-world photos &mdash; especially the kind most people share online &mdash; the gap isn&rsquo;t as big anymore.

<p id="p6">While the blog version is good, I&rsquo;d recommend Oliur&rsquo;s YouTube version for more in-depth breakdowns and an interesting conclusion.</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote7"><p>
  The iPhone&rsquo;s convenience and computational power make it competitive in almost every normal scenario. If someone told me they rely solely on their phone for photography today, I wouldn&rsquo;t argue with them.

<p id="p8">As someone who loves photography but doesn&rsquo;t want to commit to a dedicated camera, it&rsquo;s good to know that after some adjustments, the iPhone&rsquo;s input can now result in an output that is competitive with a traditional camera &ndash; at least for my use cases.</p>
