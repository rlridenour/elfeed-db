I wrote what was supposed to be today&rsquo;s post last night but in the light of day I decided I didn&rsquo;t like it and had to start over. Fortunately, I found this set of slides on <a href="https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~elec399/201409/Akin%27s%20Laws%20of%20Spacecraft%20Design.pdf">Akin&rsquo;s Laws of Spacecraft Design</a>. They appear to be lecture notes from a course at the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/index.php">University of Victoria</a>.
</p>
<p>
They are, as the title suggests, nominally about aeronautical engineering but the &ldquo;laws&rdquo; apply equally well to software engineering or, really, any type of engineering. The fact that they aren&rsquo;t specialized to software engineering makes them seem more general and applicable because they do get into the weeds of a developer&rsquo;s job.

Most Irreal readers are sure to find something they like in the slides. One of my favorites was
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
– Engineering is not a religion.<br />
   • Technical apostasy is perfectly acceptable.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On another note, it&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s eve so be safe and stay off the roads if you can. We here at the Irreal bunker want you back tomorrow.</p>
