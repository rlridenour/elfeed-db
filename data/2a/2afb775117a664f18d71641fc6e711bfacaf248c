<p>The 1984 action comedy <em>Top Secret!</em> contains an odd sequence set in a Swedish bookstore. Val Kilmer, Lucy Gutteridge, and Peter Cushing acted the entire scene backward, and the filmmakers then reversed this performance to produce a dreamlike atmosphere in which impossible things happen.</p>
<p>The scene required 17 takes and four dogs, co-director Jim Abrahams told <a href="https://screencrush.com/top-secret-30/">ScreenCrush</a>. &#8220;Each dog stopped being hungry.&#8221;</p>
