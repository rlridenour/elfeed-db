Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies Johny Srouji could be the next leading executive to leave the company amid an alarming exodus of leading employees, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/apple-rocked-by-executive-departures-with-johny-srouji-at-risk-of-leaving-next">Mark Gurman reports</a>.<br/>

Srouji apparently recently told CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> that he is "seriously considering leaving" in the near future. He intends to join another company if he departs. Srouji leads Apple's chip design and pioneered the transition to Apple silicon.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, it emerged that Meta had hired multiple significant Apple employees, including longtime Apple designer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/apple-alan-dye-joining-meta/">Alan Dye</a>, while conducting its own recruiting blitz for AI and smart glasses development. Meanwhile, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/two-more-apple-executives-retiring/">announced the retirement</a> of Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kate Adams, Lisa Jackson, Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai-chief-retiring-after-siri-failure/">AI chief John Giannandrea</a>. Earlier this year, Apple lost Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/jeff-williams-stepping-down-as-apple-coo/">who is retiring</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-cfo-luca-maestri-stepping-down/">Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri</a>. There have also been rumors about Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; retiring, with rumors suggesting he is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/report-tim-cook-to-step-down-as-soon-as-next-year/">preparing to leave his role</a> as soon as next year.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says that the losses are partly due to veteran executives nearing retirement age, but there is still a "disconcerting brain drain" taking place in the company. Nevertheless, Gurman says the accumulative weight of the departures all adds up to "one of the most tumultuous stretches of Cooks tenure." Some of the losses are said to be a "cause for deep concern," and Cook is now looking to prevent further loss of leading talent with stronger compensation packages.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman notes that "Apple hasn't launched a successful new product category in a decade," leaving it increasingly vulnerable to having its talent poached by more agile rivals who are said to be better equipped to develop the next generation of devices and AI technologies. <br/>
<br/>
Cook himself is thought to be likely to join the exodus and step down in the not-too-distant future. He turned 65 last month and now exhibits a noticeable, unexplained tremor in his hands. He is likely to transition to the role of chairman, rather than vacate the company entirely.<br/>
<br/>
The departure of Srouji is said to be "a more imminent risk" and Cook is purportedly working hard to retain him by offering a substantial pay package and the potential of more responsibility. Some executives have suggested elevating Srouji to the role of chief technology officer. This would move him to oversee a broad range of hardware engineering and silicon technologies, making him Apple's second-most powerful executive. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman says this change would likely require John Ternus to be promoted to CEO, but Srouji apparently would prefer to not work under a different CEO, even with an expanded remit. If he does leave, Srouji would likely be replaced by Zongjian Chen or Sribalan Santhanam. Beyond Srouji and the other reported departures, Apple is believed to be contending with a significant talent drain among its key engineers. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman explains that there has been "a broader collapse within Apple's artificial intelligence organization" triggered by AI models chief Ruoming Pang departing earlier this year, along with colleagues such as Tom Gunter and Frank Chu. Apple lost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and search overseer Robby Walker, as well as his replacement, Ke Yang, to Meta.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's AI group is apparently suffering from low morale and there is growing worry over the increasing use of external AI technology such as Google Gemini. Around a dozen of Apple's leading AI researchers have also now departed. <br/>
<br/>
The company's AI robotics software team has seen widespread departures, including its leader Jian Zhang, who joined Meta. The user interface team has also lost members, such as Billy Sorrentino, culminating in Dye's exit. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's hardware design group "has been nearly wiped out," with many employees vacating to other companies or following former design chief Jony Ive to his studio, LoveFrom. Abidur Chowdhury, the designer behind the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> who narrated its unveiling in September, left for an AI startup.<br/>
<br/>
The company has lost a key director in charge of display technologies, Cheng Chen, to OpenAI. He also oversaw the optics of the Vision Pro headset. In addition, one of Apple’s top hardware engineering executives, Tang Tan, similarly left for OpenAI.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has even lost the dean of Apple University, Richard Locke. Apple University is the internal program intended to preserve the company's practices and culture following the death of Steve Jobs.<br/>
<br/>
The exodus has become a major concern for Apple's leadership, which has instructed human resources to ramp up recruitment and retention efforts.
