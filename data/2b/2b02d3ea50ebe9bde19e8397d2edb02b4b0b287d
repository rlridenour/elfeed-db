<p>Cuba has told international airlines it can no longer provide jet fuel at multiple airports, a move that has already triggered flight suspensions and emergency plans to bring stranded passengers home. Air Canada, for example, has paused service and is operating empty aircraft to repatriate customers already on the island. The refuelling limits highlight a broader energy crunch, with rolling blackouts and fuel rationing squeezing daily life and hard-currency earners such as tourism and aviation. Several outlets point to the Trump administration’s stepped-up effort to cut Cuba off from oil supplies, including a recent executive order that threatens tariffs on countries that sell or provide oil to Cuba. Matters worsened after fuel shipments from Venezuela—described as Cuba’s main supplier—stopped following a U.S. military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and after Mexico said it would suspend shipments amid U.S. tariff threats. As pressure has mounted, Cuba has rolled out emergency conservation steps, including closing schools and universities, shortening the work week, and cutting public transport. The shortage is also raising immediate worries about healthcare and basic supplies, with reports of hospitals strained by the lack of fuel.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/3CGXZH2hrmQCsXqAC8fDPXDA8DDYznjPqnJXPZrP81OnCR2PwkguBGOUDoiY-WRhYcHqGhMaMyU8wuXTncrmrrcqP0W7Oybp3RGtE_T7BJvw4luxLBypjz1uUctYcobyZKBkZh0L4eaqLa2ZTYdc0HEBas_2qxvqB9yZnC7sI7pTlTEf-CTYuPaLMzDV32JMK_YJ66BrixhKadJdoqUEIqw65yajd1yEsUSWeSyN9GfVS2sZQpDmheKohvnfHA' alt='A passenger jet is towed at José Martí International Airport after Cuba warned jet fuel would not be available, Havana, Feb. 9, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Airports affected: Cuba warned that jet fuel would not be available at nine airports across the island, including Havana’s José Martí International Airport, as part of rationing steps.</li><li>Reserves outlook: Time reported in late January that an estimate put Cuba’s oil reserves at about “15 to 20 days” at then-current demand levels.</li><li>Notice timing: Cuba published notices to pilots and airlines on Sunday night saying refuelling would be unavailable starting Tuesday, while aviation authorities separately told airlines the suspension could last a month.</li><li>Long-haul exposure: The refuelling shortage is expected to hit long-haul routes hardest—and with them the tourism flows that bring Cuba hard currency.</li><li>Diplomatic sparring: Russia called Cuba’s fuel situation “critical” and accused the U.S. of trying to “suffocate” the island’s economy, while Cuba’s foreign minister called Washington’s approach “cruel”.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Cuban government: Aviation authorities told airlines refuelling services would be suspended for a month as jet fuel supplies run low.
