Apple's adoption of a 200-megapixel camera for a future iPhone is still some ways off, according to a prominent supply chain leaker who says such a sensor is not currently part of Apple's active prototype testing.<br/>

In a <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/5252407685546916">post on Weibo</a>, Chinese leaker Digital Chat Station said that 200-megapixel camera sensors are being discussed in the supply chain, but they have not appeared in iPhone engineering prototypes undergoing real-world imaging tests. Instead, Apple's current camera development work is said to remain focused on refining 48-megapixel systems, as per previous reports.<br/>
<br/>
The leaker's comments follow a research note from Morgan Stanley this week that suggested Apple is working to bring a 200-megapixel camera to the iPhone as soon as 2028. Digital Chat Station's remarks don't rule out such a move – indeed, the leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/iphone-200-megapixel-camera-rumor/">said last May</a> that Apple was looking at future adoption – but they do indicate that engineering-stage development on the sensor has yet to begin.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung introduced a 200-megapixel rear camera on its Galaxy S23 Ultra in 2023, and the follow-up models also have one. With a 200-megapixel camera, an iPhone would be able to shoot photos with greater detail. The increased megapixel count would also result in higher-resolution photos, which can be cropped further and printed at larger sizes without a loss of image quality.<br/>
<br/>
However, Digital Chat Station says current Pro-series prototypes continue to test a 48-megapixel main camera with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/27/iphone-18-pro-variable-aperture-camera/">variable aperture</a>, alongside a 48-megapixel telephoto camera featuring a longer focal length and a larger aperture. The leaker says these changes will be introduced later this year in iPhone 18 Pro models, indicating Apple is continuing its emphasis on optical flexibility and low-light performance, rather than a jump in raw resolution.<br/>
<br/>
The leaker adds that 200-megapixel sensors – reportedly supplied by Samsung – are currently only at a material or component evaluation stage. This typically refers to early feasibility checks within the supply chain, rather than integration into complete iPhone prototypes.  <br/>

Digital Chat Station also notes that Apple has shown interest in "multispectral imaging technology", though testing has reportedly not yet begun. Multispectral imaging could theoretically enable improved material/object detection and image processing, but there is no suggestion that such features are anywhere close to shipping.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/07/200mp-iphone-camera-not-yet-prototyped/">200MP iPhone Camera Not Yet in Active Prototype Testing, Says Leaker</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/200mp-iphone-camera-not-yet-in-active-prototype-testing-says-leaker.2475704/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
