<p><a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/06/ptpl-176-simple-obsidian-iphone-shortcuts" title="wikilink">I mostly run my life in plain text</a>, so I was initially excited to learn about plain text email. One email into investigating it, however, I was out!</p>
<p>As much as I love the idea of a fully plain text life, I’ve decided that naked email is, for me, a step too far. I deal with customers who like pretty links, images, and formatting in the emails I send to them. I appreciate images and formatting in (most of) the emails I receive.</p>
<p>(I am writing this as a low-tech person. Much to learn.)</p>
<h3 id="are-html-emails-dangerous">Are <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails dangerous?</h3>
<p><span class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails can contain tracking pixels, and spoofed links.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://useplaintext.email/" target="_blank">Use Plain Text Email</a> website says—</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails are mainly used for marketing - that is, emails you probably don’t want to see in the first place. The few advantages they offer for end-users, such as links, inline images, and bold or italic text, aren’t worth the trade-off. —<a href="https://useplaintext.email/#why-plaintext" target="_blank">why plain text</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails I receive are, for the most part, those I’ve signed up to. Their links and images can be helpful. Some are marketing messages I’ve agreed to receive. Others, like the example below, are order confirmations with useful reference information, including images.</p>
<p>It is true that, in some cases,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><a href="https://useplaintext.email/#why-plaintext:~:text=Privacy%20invasion%20and%20tracking" target="_blank"><span class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails are good for marketers and bad for you</a><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span>. Receiving emails in plain text would unmask any nefarious links hiding behind convincing graphics. But you would still need to know what you are looking for, in order to recognise links that point to bogus websites. This isn’t something your grandma is necessarily going to know how to do without some guidance.</p>
<p>Here’s an order confirmation email I received this week, in both <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> and plain text formats:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/51ad1396-819a-42cc-8a48-36b2389cbbea.png" alt="Two side by side screenshots of a MooGoo order, showing one in rich text and the other in plain text. The rich text version has an Order Confirmation graphic at the top, and a View Order Status button at the bottom. The plain text version has lines of monospaced text, with a partially obscured, extremely long URL beneath the words “View Order Status”." width="2930" height="1624"></p>
<p>I like seeing thumbnails of the products I’ve purchased (visible when scrolling down the <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> version), and it’s good to have clear links I can go to in case of a problem with the order. The portion of the text you can see above (right) is just a snippet of a much longer message that contained all sorts of goobledegook. Some <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails viewed as text can be very messy.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that the potential security issues of <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails are a real thing. These are the rules I follow in order to mitigate the risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off auto-loading of images</li>
<li>Actively maintain a suspicious mindset!</li>
<li>View individual emails as text as needed to verify the source</li>
<li>Don’t click on <em>any</em> link inside an unverified email</li>
<li>Never log into a site by clicking on a link within an email; always go directly to the website in the usual manner to login</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-now">What now?</h3>
<p>I will always advocate for your most important information being stored in plain text, no matter what else you do with it. You won’t be able to change my mind on that one.</p>
<p>Looking into the two main email formats has made it clear that despite its advantages, plain text is not the best choice for every person, in every situation.</p>
<p>I recommend getting familiar with your email client’s settings, and change as needed. You could send yourself a few emails with the different types of quoted text and see which style you prefer.</p>
