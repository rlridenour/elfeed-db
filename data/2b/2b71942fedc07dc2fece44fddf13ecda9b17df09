It&rsquo;s been years since I wrote about <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=7927">Gilles  Castel and his astounding ability to take LaTeX notes so fast that he was able to keep up with the the instructor in his Mathematics classes</a>. Sadly, Castel died in 2022 but his blog—including the two posts [<a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/">1</a>, <a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-2/">2</a>] that deal with taking Mathematics notes with the associated diagrams—is still up.

Castel used Vim so he didn&rsquo;t have AUCTeX but he did have a large collection of <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips">UltiSnips</a> snippets that he used to make entering LaTeX fast and relatively painless. One feature of UltiSnips that he leveraged was the ability to specify the trigger word with a regular expression. For example, he uses that capability to recognize subscripts so that <code>a2</code> → <code>a_2</code>. See <a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/">his post</a> for other examples.

Naturally, we Emacs nerds went crazy and attempted to replicate his system in Emacs. Karthink had <a href="https://karthinks.com/software/latex-input-for-impatient-scholars/">a particularly good solution</a> using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/">AUCTeX</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cdominik/cdlatex">CDLaTeX</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet">YASnippet</a>. Still it <i>would</i> be nice to be able to specify triggers with a regex.

Over at the Emacs subreddit, nmorazotti has a solution. He&rsquo;s put together a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1qysf9e/resnippetsel_snippets_with_regex/">snippet package, Resnippets.el, that can recognize a regex as a trigger</a>. If you&rsquo;ve been yearning to try Castel&rsquo;s approach to taking LaTeX notes, resnippets may be useful.

I won&rsquo;t be using it for two reasons. First it&rsquo;s LLM generated and I have a prejudice—rational or not—against AI generated code. Second, and probably more important, is that the snippets are all autoapplied. I HATE that. I want to explicitly invoke the snippet with a <kbd>Tab</kbd>. Actually, UltiSnips has this right. By default you invoke its snippet explicitly but you can, on an individual snippet basis, choose to have them invoked automatically.

I don&rsquo;t know if anyone is still interested in all this but it was fun for me to revisit it.</p>
