Apple today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEalzEnT70k">touching video</a> that highlights how the iPhone's Action mode allows for people with Parkinson's disease to record stable videos.<br/>

Parkinson's disease can cause hand tremors, which could ordinarily result in a hand-held video recording appearing shaky, but the Camera app's Action mode automatically stabilizes video recordings so that footage appears smooth.<br/>
<br/>
"The simple act of filming can be challenging for people with Parkinson's," says Apple.<br/>
<br/>
"For Brett, Bette, and Ellen, every moment matters," adds Apple. "With Action mode on iPhone, they can capture smooth hand-held videos and reclaim the joy of filming their favorite moments — supported by accessibility features like Voice Control, which help them operate the camera and navigate their iPhone with ease."<br/>

"For someone like me, who's been using cameras for 30 years, it being an option again is kind of life-changing," said Brett.<br/>
<br/>
Action mode is available on all iPhone 14 through iPhone 16 models, except for the iPhone 16e.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/accessibility/">Accessibility</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/apple-no-frame-missed-video/">Apple Shows How iPhone&#039;s Action Mode Helps People With Parkinson&#039;s</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shows-how-iphones-action-mode-helps-people-with-parkinsons.2463693/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
