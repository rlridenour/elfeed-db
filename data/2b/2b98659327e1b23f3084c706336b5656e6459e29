<p>An airstrike by Myanmar’s ruling military hit a major public hospital in Mrauk U township in western Rakhine state late Wednesday, killing at least 30–31 people and injuring more than 70, according to the Arakan Army, an on-site aid worker and local witnesses. The 300‑bed Mrauk U General Hospital was reportedly full because many other health services in the conflict-affected state had shut down, and photos from the scene showed the building reduced to rubble with bodies lined up outside. The junta, which did not immediately comment, has been escalating air and artillery attacks in a push to retake territory from the Arakan Army and other ethnic armed groups ahead of elections it has announced for December 28, which resistance forces have vowed to disrupt in areas they control. The strike adds to a worsening humanitarian situation in Rakhine, where both fighting and a breakdown of basic services have left civilians with dwindling access to medical care and safe shelter.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DEseyhcEUlIhqQ769EacXTYk3xXjsT9jBEw4y_ZMA7PyQN3dmgNi5qr74N0AS3_7tlaYG0hsEwGBqXl_slxhyVRTRf1iB_-E1_WfXdErsqe7' alt='Mrauk U General Hospital lies in ruins after a Myanmar military airstrike in western Rakhine state on December 11, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Crowded facility: Witnesses and aid workers said the hospital was operating over capacity because many clinics and services elsewhere in Rakhine have suspended operations due to ongoing clashes.</li><li>Extent of destruction: Images from the scene showed the hospital’s roof collapsed, support columns shattered and the main building burned out, with debris scattered across the compound.</li><li>Election backdrop: The military has scheduled multi-day national polls starting December 28 as a purported route out of conflict, but resistance groups have pledged to prevent voting in areas under their control.</li><li>Intensified campaign: Analysts cited by international media say the junta has increased airstrikes and bombardment in several regions as it struggles to reverse territorial losses to ethnic armed forces and anti-coup resistance groups.</li><li>Local emergency response: Surviving patients were hurriedly evacuated from the destroyed facility to undisclosed locations deemed safer, according to an aid worker who visited the site after the strike.</li></ul><blockquote>The Mrauk U General Hospital was completely destroyed. - Khine Thu Kha</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Arakan Army: The Arakan Army said a military aircraft dropped bombs directly on the Mrauk U General Hospital, causing extensive casualties among patients and staff and leaving the facility “completely destroyed.”.
