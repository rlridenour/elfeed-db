<p>Sarah Perez, writing at TechCrunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We’ve structured this entire business around being a sustainable,
profitable, and hopefully, long-running enterprise, but not a
startup,” Migicovsky told TechCrunch on the sidelines of the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week. [...]</p>

<p>“I want a companion to my phone, rather than a replacement for my
phone. I want it to be more like a Swatch than a Rolex. I want it
to be a little bit more fun, casual, playful, and plasticky.”
Plus, he added, with the reboot of Pebble, he’s now okay with a
watch that doesn’t try to do it all.</p>

<p>“I’m okay with a limited vision and a limited scope of what we’re
trying to accomplish,” Migicovsky said.</p>

<p>Under the new company, Core Devices, the team has announced the

2</a>, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/pebbles-founder-introduces-a-75-ai-smart-ring-for-recording-brief-notes-with-a-press-of-a-button/">$75 AI smart ring, called the Index 01</a>.</p>

<p>What a great profile from Perez. I think she captured the current moment for Core Devices. I personally don’t want their new watches, and I don’t see the appeal (especially ergonomically, given that it needs to be on your index finger) of the Index 01 ring, but I can see why some people might. And I’m delighted to see a small company trying these things. Better to make things a few people might love than to try to make something zillions might like.</p>
