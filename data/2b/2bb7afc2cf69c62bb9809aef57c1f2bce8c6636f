HoneySQL is a wonderful Clojure library that lets use the full power of Clojure collections to generate your SQL statements. Postgres supports json operators and data types, which is one of the main features for which I use it; however, since this is a non-SQL-standard feature, HoneySQL doesn&rsquo;t support it directly, and I didn&rsquo;t see that support in HoneySQL-Postgres yet. Fortunately, HoneySQL makes it easy to extend this way.
