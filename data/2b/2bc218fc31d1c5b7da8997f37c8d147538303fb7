<p>President Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, a new Detroit–Windsor crossing scheduled to open in the first half of 2026. He says he wants the United States “fully compensated” and is pressing for negotiations with Ottawa. The White House has also said Trump could amend a permit tied to the project, keeping the planned launch of a major trade and travel link between the two neighbors uncertain. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he spoke with Trump on Tuesday and called the conversation “positive.” He said the row would be resolved and emphasized the bridge’s importance for cross-border commerce, tourism, and travel. Carney, along with other reporting, disputes Trump’s claims about financing and ownership. Multiple outlets cite project information saying Canada financed the bridge and that it will be publicly owned, with a U.S. stake linked to Michigan.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/TdSXRSsZSKYa34PZ6Jet20f17vYvZdvMuvgpD9ZftzdWIHPpBfLwDCm4x4NcTL7WrHVeF4fvq0JtHwhWc8Lc_zCebN1Osg0UvAOfCyZEabJc' alt='The under-construction Gordie Howe International Bridge linking Detroit to Windsor, Ontario, seen from Detroit on Feb. 10, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>U.S.-content dispute: Trump alleged the bridge used “virtually” no U.S. products.
