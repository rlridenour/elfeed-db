Smartphone price comparison platform <a href="https://www.sellcell.com/blog/iphone-17-pre-launch-survey/">SellCell</a> surveyed over 2,000 U.S.-based &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in August to assess upgrade interest and brand loyalty before Apple's event. According to the data, 68.3% of current &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users intend to purchase an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; model at launch, marking an increase from 61.9% recorded ahead of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> launch in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max models are expected to dominate early sales, accounting for 38.1% of planned upgrades. The standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; is the choice for 16.7% of respondents, while 13.5% expressed interest in the all-new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, which is expected to feature an ultra-thin design. Only 3.3% of respondents indicated they are holding out specifically for a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, which Apple has yet to release.<br/>
<br/>
The survey highlights that 72.9% of users feel more satisfied with their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; today than in previous years, but 27.1% said they believe Apple has "lost its edge" compared to rival smartphone makers. <br/>
<br/>
Battery life emerged as the most important upgrade driver, with 53.% of respondents citing it as their top reason for upgrading. Other motivating factors included new designs and features (36.2%), display improvements (34.3%), camera upgrades (28.1%), and AI and software enhancements (7.1%). <br/>
<br/>
Price remains the primary deterrent, with 68.9% of users listing cost as the main reason for not upgrading. Satisfaction with existing devices is also a significant factor, with 71.7% stating they are content with their current &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. A smaller share of users cited interest in foldables (7.5%), discomfort with eSIM (6.6%), or interest in switching to Android (5.3%) as reasons for holding off.<br/>
<br/>
Foldables from Samsung and Google are emerging as a competitive threat. If Apple does not release a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by 2026, 20.1% of respondents say they would consider switching to Samsung, and 10.2% to Google. Brand loyalty remains high, with 69.6% of respondents stating they plan to stay with Apple regardless of competing products. <br/>
<br/>
When asked to choose between device thinness and battery capacity, 47.5% of respondents said they would accept a shorter battery life in exchange for a thinner design. Meanwhile, 29.7% said they are not interested in ultra-thin phones at all.<br/>
<br/>
44% of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users said they view <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> as a very important feature. Another 33% said AI does not matter to them. When asked which company leads in AI, 44% named Apple, while both Samsung and Google were selected by 6.6% of respondents. Ten percent of users said no brand currently leads in the AI space.<br/>
<br/>
36.8% of users would delay upgrading if prices rise significantly, while 29.2% said they would decide based on the size of the increase. Only 34% said they would proceed with their purchase regardless.<br/>
<br/>
The survey was conducted using an online survey platform, with responses collected in August 2025 from a sample of over 2,000 U.S. adults who currently own an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup is expected to be announced on Tuesday, September 9.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/">SellCell</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/01/nearly-70-of-users-plan-to-upgrade-to-iphone-17/">Survey: Nearly 70% of Users Plan to Upgrade to iPhone 17</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/survey-nearly-70-of-users-plan-to-upgrade-to-iphone-17.2464411/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
