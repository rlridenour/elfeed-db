<p>Snap general election results in the Netherlands produced an extremely tight finish: preliminary counts and exit polls showed the centrist Democrats 66 (D66) and Geert Wilders’s far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) effectively level at about 26 seats each in the 150-seat House of Representatives, with counting continuing . The vote marked a strong comeback for D66 after a poor 2023 showing and a setback for Wilders, whose coalition collapsed earlier this year after he pulled partners over an immigration package . D66 leader Rob Jetten is positioned to lead initial coalition talks and could become the country’s youngest prime minister; most mainstream parties signalled reluctance to join any government with Wilders, making a PVV-led cabinet unlikely .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gWcKS4axU_nG5smhhvgIRtU5cq1MvWQgXF6gsdB8Jbk_lsZbApHNpMKc4oVx5yf8FT5ugdLtVMqtqUzN4LmQgM5T3B-2amJprEqs5yraTgOuFcr7IeLhtOIBQIjejbZpUqMPuqlEJl95EF9L-E5368qZoMg_EXBIcKUFmNj7a4vcsjxY0ZEgMJ71nSMmuDmU7dxfpfEOh7omMIOmLRsqAAagEJ8dVkJTRpANAcfmTUTKWdEa' alt='Supporters of D66 in Leiden celebrating early exit-poll results.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Seat swings: Exit-poll and early projections suggested D66 made its largest gains in decades—rising roughly by the high teens in seats compared with 2023—while Wilders’ PVV lost about a dozen seats in preliminary counts .</li><li>Voter participation: Official tallies cited by local agencies showed a high turnout, with public broadcaster figures putting participation around 78.4% as counting proceeded toward completion .</li><li>Campaign themes: Analysts said the campaign focused on housing shortages, nitrogen pollution and immigration, issues that helped drive late shifts in voter support toward centrist policy proposals .</li><li>Election night mood: Supporters at D66 and GreenLeft headquarters celebrated exit-poll gains, with videos and reports describing scenes of joy as preliminary results were released .</li></ul><blockquote>The positive forces have won!
