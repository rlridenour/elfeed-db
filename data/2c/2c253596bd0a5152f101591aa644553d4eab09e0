<li>A flashlight and a couple nice little lanterns that pop up</li>
<li>Great for camping, power outages, basement projects, whatever</li>
<li>Are they available in Georgia Red: Yeah, sorta (though to our eyes, that might be more of an Alabama Crimson)</li>
</ul><h1>Lumen Over You</h1><p>May the fourth be with you, amirite?!</p>
<p>Because, c’mon, these are vaguely <em>Star Wars</em>-y, yeah? I mean, just look at this:</p>

<p>Is that a couple lanterns and a flashlight? Or is that a lightsaber between two of R2D2’s little cousins?! Who’s to say!</p>
<p>Okay, but seriously, given we’re talking about a Disney product, we should clarify for legal purposes: these have no affiliation with <em>Star Wars</em> (or any film franchise for that matter). We just wanted to note the resemblance given the date.  And we’re out of the silver anyways… but you could always paint them (don’t do that).</p>
<p>Also, we’ve offered up a lot of flashlights and lanterns recently, and we didn’t want to open with the same pitch we’ve used the last ten sales.</p>
<p>Which is: you really can’t have too many flashlights and lanterns.</p>
<p>And to be clear, the issue isn’t with the pitch itself. We still believe it, and, in fact, if you bought each of the past few flashlights and/or lanterns, you could also buy this without fear of overdoing it.</p>
<p>As previously stated, you can stash them all in a tote in the basement and forget they exist. UNTIL! The power goes out, and now, suddenly, who’s the super responsible parent/partner/roommate/neighbor with a light for everyone? There can be a lantern in the kids’ playroom, next to your reading chair, in the bathroom, in the garage, plus flashlights for everyone to get from one room to the next. And you’d still have some to lend out around the neighborhood.</p>
<p>So, again, airtight pitch.</p>
<p>The problem is, when you repeat it too much, you start to seem like a light-obsessed weirdo. In fact, you seem like way more of a weirdo than the person who has a tote full of thirty lights and lanterns in their basement.</p>
<p>So let’s pretend we didn’t use it again, shall we?</p>
<p>Buy some lights, people.</p>
