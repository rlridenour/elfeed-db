<p>Demetri Sevastopulo and Michael Acton, reporting for the Financial Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the US government 15 per cent
of the revenues from chip sales in China, as part of an unusual
arrangement with the Trump administration to obtain export
licences for the semiconductors. [...]</p>

<p>The quid pro quo arrangement is unprecedented. According to export
control experts, no US company has ever agreed to pay a portion of
their revenues to obtain export licences.</p>

<p>But the deal <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4273254b-6e1f-4cb1-bca7-19c7389c719a">fits a pattern</a> in the Trump administration
where the president urges companies to take measures, such as
domestic investments, for example, to prevent the imposition of
tariffs in an effort to bring in jobs and revenue to America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This FT report starts out on shaky ground, using <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/11/unusual-agreements">the same “unusual agreement” euphemism</a> as the WSJ and NYT reports, but they soon found a little backbone with “The quid pro quo arrangement is unprecedented.”</p>

<p>This is not merely unusual. It is unprecedented. Seemingly, too, <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S9-C5-1/ALDE_00013596/">plainly unconstitutional</a>.</p>

<p>Quipped a friend: “Nvidia and AMD’s general counsels must be wondering how much of this money they can eventually get back, if we ever reverse the banana republic index.”</p>
