<p>Japan votes in a snap lower-house election on Sunday. Polls suggest Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is on track for a decisive win—and could regain a governing majority after recent setbacks and a slush-fund scandal that hurt the party’s standing. Takaichi, Japan’s first female prime minister, took office about three months ago and has quickly built unusually strong approval ratings and a high-profile following—especially among younger voters—sometimes dubbed “Sana-mania”. The campaign has put her direct, youth-friendly style front and center. Supporters describe her as plain-spoken and determined to restore optimism, while the race has also sharpened debates about where Japan goes next on immigration, economic policy, and regional security. Beyond the buzz, the vote will show whether Takaichi can turn early popularity into durable parliamentary power—and what a stronger mandate could mean for Japan’s economy and its already strained relationship with China.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/VYnq5f7zFGm48BK1QzBeeWs5tPxBcqb2H3OIAag4IT-Njfl-trBvJGuHabnZAh_YPVx2Vu0rV2KhVghm4HvD3i9eG8so55SLaVlppYOLmBrV' alt='Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi speaks during a press conference at the prime minister’s official residence in Tokyo, January 19, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Approval ratings: null</li><li>Majority math: Surveys suggest the LDP could clear the 233-seat threshold needed for a lower-house majority, though many voters say they are still undecided.</li><li>Policy expectations: Coverage says investors are positioning for a longer Takaichi tenure, which could open the door to more expansive fiscal policy and shareholder-friendly measures.
