<p>French police are searching for a gang that used an extendable ladder to break into the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery on Sunday morning and steal eight pieces from France’s royal jewelry collection in a swift four-to-seven-minute raid [nytimes.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][washingtonpost.com#1][bbc.com#2]. The thieves escaped on motorbikes, while the crown of Empress Eugénie was later recovered in a damaged state nearby, and no injuries were reported [theglobeandmail.com#1][bbc.com#3].
