<p>Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office carried out surprise searches at properties linked to presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak in Kyiv on November 28 as part of a widening graft investigation in the energy sector. Investigators say the searches are connected to an alleged kickback scheme worth around €100 million involving Ukraine’s nuclear and broader energy industries, a case that has already led to charges against businessman Timur Mindich and implicated several current and former officials. Yermak confirmed that investigators were inside his home, said they faced no obstacles, and stressed he was cooperating with the probe with his lawyers present. The operation marks a rare move against one of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s closest allies, raising domestic political pressure and questions about possible implications for Western-backed peace efforts that Yermak helps lead, even as it underscores that Ukraine’s anti-corruption institutions are actively investigating powerful insiders during wartime.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/WsUNsW17GZp2MUVZNkTSmWsezYdrQ79BiJWFNRYjFIQsTSPqLF4t1aYbsxtZF3w02fWGNFbxigqhZ73JiR8s-UyZ9wo8pBu4-40w_0liy61FAgDTi0Y8-dz8YtJlVyGvhxNQxeOjZmUgb_qfThnvfAP43KwpM8ymX_2AO9t0W_7EwJU4VTo1d_d6AAaHaA-M3eNl7cHmiLBHjSRe83dhtllIocX3pwWihzHwUg' alt='Andriy Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff and lead negotiator in peace talks, speaking at a recent event in Geneva.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Energy scheme focus: The investigation centers on alleged kickbacks linked to state nuclear power company Energoatom and other energy deals, in which prosecutors say intermediaries extracted large payments from contracts while Ukraine faces repeated Russian strikes on its energy grid.</li><li>Businessman abroad: Key suspect Timur Mindich, a longtime associate of Zelenskyy, left Ukraine before his residence was searched and is now listed under Israeli nationality in Ukrainian sanctions documents, raising questions about how fully Kyiv can enforce measures against him.</li><li>Political backlash: Earlier in November, some Ukrainian lawmakers and civil society watchdogs publicly urged Zelenskyy to dismiss Yermak over his reported links to people named in the probe, reflecting growing unease about high-level corruption during the war.</li><li>Institutions under pressure: In the summer, Zelenskyy’s office and parliament advanced steps that would have placed NABU and the special anti-corruption prosecutor under the prosecutor general’s supervision, but reversed course after street protests and European Union pressure to preserve their independence.</li><li>Peace talks role: Despite controversy, Yermak was recently appointed Kyiv’s chief negotiator on a United States-backed proposal for ending the conflict with Russia, making any disruption to his position especially sensitive for ongoing diplomatic efforts.</li></ul><blockquote>The investigators have no obstacles. - Andriy Yermak</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Andriy Yermak: Yermak said that searches were taking place at his home, investigators had been given full access, and his lawyers were on site interacting with law enforcement, presenting his stance as open cooperation with the inquiry.
