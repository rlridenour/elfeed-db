<p>I had a problem. I wanted to put a stray E-Ink device, which I had sort of given up on, back into action. It has a color screen, but my attempts to write out color graphics were coming up empty. I <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2025/02/gifs-transparency-and-pil/">turned to the Internet’s Dr. Drang for help</a>:</p>

  A week or so ago, <a href="https://sixcolors.com/">Jason Snell</a> asked if I could help with a problem he was having using the <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Python Imaging Library</a> (PIL) . He wanted to update <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/09/a-smart-e-ink-calendar-comes-to-my-kitchen/">his e-ink status board</a> with color images, as he now has the color e-ink display that <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/11/creating-a-smart-on-air-sign-with-an-e-ink-display/">Dan Moren uses</a>. But he couldn’t get consistent results as he tried to use PIL to change the color of black pixels to different colors in a set of GIF images that were overlaid on his calendar background.

<p>Related: Dr. Drang also <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2025/02/chit-chat-about-charts/">wrote a piece about my approach to financial charts</a>, based on my <a href="https://www.podfeet.com/blog/2025/02/ccatp-808/">interview with Allison Sheridan last week</a>. I enjoyed reading the judgment of someone far more versed in charting than I am.</p>
