<p>Wiley Hodges, a 22-year veteran of Apple product marketing, who retired in 2022, in an open letter he sent to Tim Cook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know where this leaves me as an Apple customer, but I do
know that it upsets me as an Apple shareholder. I am asking you
and your team to more clearly explain the basis on which you made
the decision to remove ICEBlock — and how the government showed
good faith and strong evidence in making its demand of Apple, or
that you reinstate the app in the App Store.</p>

<p>I hope that as a man of integrity and principle you can understand
how outrageous this situation is. Even more, I hope you recognize
how every inch you voluntarily give to an authoritarian regime
adds to their illegitimately derived power. We are at a critical
juncture in our country’s history where we face the imminent
threat of the loss of our constitutional republic. It is up to all
of us to demand that the rule of law rather than the whims of a
handful of people — even elected ones — govern our collective
enterprise. Apple and you are better than this. You represent the
best of what America can be, and I pray that you will find it in
your heart to continue to demonstrate that you are true to the
values you have so long and so admirably espoused.</p>

<p>When you give a bully your lunch money, they always come back for more. </p>

<p>Disney learned this. Last December, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/16/nx-s1-5230274/abc-settles-with-trump-for-15-million-now-he-wants-to-sue-other-news-outlets">Disney settled a lawsuit Trump had filed against ABC News and host George Stephanopoulos for $15 million</a>. The lawsuit was bullshit; nearly all experts agreed that if Disney/ABC had taken the case to court, <a href="https://fair.org/home/abc-settles-with-trump-in-a-case-it-could-have-won/">they’d have won</a>. Disney settled — with both the $15 million and “a note of regret” — thinking, surely, that this would get Trump off their back. Put them on Trump’s good side. Then came <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/09/23/goddard-kimmel">the Jimmy Kimmel fiasco</a>, when they <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/09/24/kimmel-returns">finally stood up</a> and said, effectively, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/03/fuck-you-make-me">Fuck you, make me</a>.”</p>

<p>Hodges, earlier in his letter, makes reference to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Adaringfireball.net+san+bernardino+fbi&amp;ia=web">Apple’s 2016 standoff with the FBI over a locked iPhone belonging to the mass shooter in San Bernardino</a>, California. The FBI and Justice Department pressured Apple to create a version of iOS that would allow them to backdoor the iPhone’s passcode lock. Apple adamantly refused.</p>

<p>The message Trump and his lickspittles surely took from Apple acceding to their “demand” regarding ICEBlock — a demand made without an iota of legal justification, nor any factual justification that the app was being used to put ICE law enforcements agents in harm’s way — is that when they make a demand to Apple, Apple will respond not with the four words “Fuck you, make me” (as they did in the 2016 San Bernardino case), but instead “Whatever you say goes”. It was, obviously, easier for Apple to stand on principle in 2016, when Barack Obama, a man who deeply respected the Constitution and the principle of rule of law, was president. But it’s more important to stand on those same principles with Trump — a would-be mad king with no respect nor even understanding of the Constitution or rule of law — in office.</p>

<p>If not now, when? Apple will, I believe, find out.</p>
