<p>Yours truly, yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem I see with the MacBook power adapter situation in
Europe is that while power users — like the sort of people who
read Daring Fireball and Pixel Envy — will have no problem buying
exactly the sort of power adapter they want, or simply re-using a
good one they already own, normal users have no idea what makes a
“good” power adapter. I suspect there are going to be a lot of
Europeans who buy a new M5 MacBook Pro and wind up charging it
with inexpensive low-watt power adapters meant for things like
phones, and wind up with a shitty, slow charging experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actual email, from actual reader <em>D.B.</em> today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anecdotes to support your point about normal customers not knowing
which power adapter to pick, I’ve had both my mother and a
mid-level IT director at my work complain that their Macs no
longer hold a battery. In both cases, they were using a 5 watt
USB-A charger.</p>

<p>It’s hard for people to understand that not all USB chargers are
the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from actual reader <em>D.K.</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My mother in law called me to ask why her MacBook Air no longer
turned on. She had called AppleCare and they told her to bring the
computer to a store for repairs. Turns out she was using a very
old 5 watt USB-A iPhone charger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And of course, the real danger isn’t using an underpowered charger. It’s thinking you can save a few bucks by buying a cheap high-watt third-party charger and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/04/cheap-batteries-are-dangerous">then burning your house down</a>.</p>
