<p>A New York state court has begun hearings on whether key evidence can be used at the upcoming murder trial of Luigi Mangione, who is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a Manhattan sidewalk in December 2024. Prosecutors played surveillance footage that appeared to show the shooting and later showed videos of police speaking with Mangione for more than half an hour inside a McDonald’s restaurant in Pennsylvania before arresting him several days after the attack. Mangione’s lawyers are asking the judge to suppress items including the handgun authorities say matches the weapon used in the killing, along with statements he gave to police, arguing they were obtained improperly. If convicted of the charges related to Thompson’s death, Mangione faces a possible life sentence, while the pretrial hearings will determine how much of the prosecution’s evidence reaches the jury.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lMPmEkeNE5BZKXtSSsqN2l49lmpGkUHqayDmBCZ14sOowclElAONFv-P71yUSvbPYDFNKh2jlIBIqQMsgSu-WL_pKzG0X5vGsPZgExonjU0narTTcojIgRldRra0sarbIzBKnHvG_aPAJFOpsUHXPucp1cNLAseAyhSzL3Ky55IbJ8boUQ9KKZewhlUR1i1AsRxK8RgFuMuPu4o0uEGLa0VrkkFPaPSOycV5n6C8RHvMqwv8gdFDbQh9s0fx5xwdtHJF7GzPg8bdz9RN3KRwnjtu4fK44eoRRmVCCYLsvh5mJltOahnzc_DAAL21NHzmeYzbRmcwR3bTfXRWEPv2DuPzY9LHL9gB0LOVjCQJBpF7p45HtELkcZvVE4Uxf95C9orBuVbAP4Q1muxkOqfLHwgOgDGYGZD5ei21_4GkhNWe1C_pxWy9Ae-O8JJDpVb2C0JRWHao9QFN64sFf3O82QSz1ZPSXYasx9rT9UF_BBY7' alt='Luigi Mangione appears in a New York courtroom during pretrial hearings on evidence in the UnitedHealthcare CEO murder case.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Surveillance footage: Courtroom monitors showed multiple surveillance clips, including images of the street shooting in Manhattan and separate video capturing Mangione inside a Pennsylvania McDonald’s shortly before police took him into custody.</li><li>Police interaction: Video from the arrest location indicates officers conversed with Mangione for over 30 minutes in the restaurant before formally detaining him in connection with Thompson’s killing.</li><li>Defense strategy: Defense attorneys focused on challenging whether investigators respected Mangione’s legal rights during questioning and evidence collection, seeking to exclude both his statements and physical items from being shown to jurors.</li><li>Prosecution position: Prosecutors argue that the contested evidence, including a gun they say is ballistically linked to the attack, is central to proving their case at trial and was lawfully obtained by police.</li><li>Public reaction: Coverage notes that the case has stirred debate in the United States over crime, corporate power and the criminal justice system, with Americans divided in their views of the accused and the broader meaning of the killing.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prosecutors: Prosecutors presented surveillance videos and asserted that the handgun they link to Mangione matches the weapon used in the New York shooting, underscoring their view that this evidence is legitimate and essential for the jury to see.
