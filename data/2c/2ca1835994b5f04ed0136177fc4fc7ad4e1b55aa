<p>The Steve Jobs Archive has remastered his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiHZqamCD8c">classic Stanford commencement address</a> for its 20th anniversary:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It’s not an obvious candidate for a classic. A commencement address by a college dropout. A talk aimed at 22-year-olds that warns “You will gradually become the old and be cleared away.” A text as shadowed by reality as soaring with inspiration: “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are also a remarkable set of emails that Jobs sent himself with notes about what he wanted to say in his speech, and a lot of details (like his nerves, and Apple PR’s attempts to suggest things for him to say) that I hadn’t heard before.</p>
<p>It remains one of the most remarkable speeches you will ever hear. And certainly one of the best things to ever happen at Stanford Stadium.<sup id="fnref-35385-luck"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-35385-luck" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup></p>
