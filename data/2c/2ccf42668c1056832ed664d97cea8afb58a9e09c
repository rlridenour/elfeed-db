<p>President Trump has begun a five-day diplomatic tour of Asia that will take him to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, and includes a planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on October 30 on the sidelines of the APEC forum . The trip is framed around efforts to ease US‑China trade tensions: US and Chinese economic teams began talks in Kuala Lumpur ahead of the leaders&#x27; meeting, and the administration announced an investigation into whether China complied with the 2020 trade deal . Mr Trump also said he would “like” to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during the trip and has described a cordial relationship with him, while Washington officials have publicly downplayed immediate prospects for such a summit . The trip comes as US negotiators try to secure tariff relief and new economic commitments while the White House manages domestic challenges at home .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JDRbJSCLv5V4vT1U5PnH6ryyf8G6xby4KDyYIoe_HrOsRPHBC7IfPHGxx5SwafnTviPgqHX5c-b9B7uCthxKulJmFBSlHMe9czVZp_rh7h1g19pl62m4iJrQ0mms0K99J1UiNMpa9JxlIM80X7aU_IN4S7jiLVQMUJ0l2XpeTIlsW9kLthW51kbtF-2ZIYGDDTjO-fmJk60' alt='President Trump and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, in 2019 at the Group of 20 Summit in Osaka, Japan.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Trade investigation: The administration opened a probe into whether China met obligations under the 2020 trade deal, a step that could justify further trade actions or tariffs if violations are found .</li><li>Negotiators on the ground: Chinese Vice‑Premier He Lifeng led Beijing’s delegation while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and trade officials met Chinese counterparts in Kuala Lumpur to try to avert escalation ahead of leaders&#x27; talks .</li><li>Regional diplomacy: On the tour’s first stop, ASEAN will formally welcome East Timor as its 11th member and Trump is set to witness a Thai‑Cambodia peace accord that US officials helped broker .</li><li>Domestic context: Analysts note that Mr Trump’s Asia trip tests his role as a statesman while he leaves a Washington dealing with a government shutdown and political turbulence .</li></ul><blockquote>Deal on everything - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He said he would like to meet North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and has signalled he wants a broad deal with China, describing his ties as cooperative and aiming for &#x27;a deal on everything&#x27; during the trip .
