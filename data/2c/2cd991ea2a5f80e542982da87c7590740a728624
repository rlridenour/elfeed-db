<p>I&rsquo;m so used to watch movies on my computer, I didn&rsquo;t think getting a new TV would be that much of a difference, but I just got a Sony BRAVIA X90L and boy&hellip;</p>
<p>We just watched Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. The depth of the black colors, the sharpness, and the enjoyment of watching it on a big screen&hellip; it was /fun/. The movie and the experience. The next upgrade is a Bluetooth hub, so we can have two headphones connected at the same time. This is a smart TV that can stream from my Synology (through my phone), no problem. It has the apps for Netflix, Prime, and Apple TV installed. I&rsquo;m going to have a lot of fun with this one.</p>
