<p>At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered one of his sharpest critiques of European partners, saying Europe “looks lost” and remains too fragmented to respond quickly and forcefully to Russia’s war on Ukraine. He argued that repeated warnings have started to feel like “Groundhog Day,” as debates continue while the security situation evolves. Zelenskyy also said he had met with President Trump shortly before the speech and that the two discussed what post-war U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine could look like; Zelenskyy described the guarantees as ready for signature and eventual ratification, without detailing what they include.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/hwfDAdinx3uaOBY1Z-ptEhzAmJxmjd_XHLzAJTcPlCVDrYcKuwix0-VESCslY-Q-itWjbm64SkRk-nGhEJZCKurtNxScVWCZckZc3RmZHmBiUclhN9Qz1tgkbx3LGiBIzjKymxT7bSfRr2tmbsiiqWn7l0DXYutky9J3sfDi4yZ9UE7MF76E7f1DQD0xdrqMrPlIAehwsuR_j4_0PetxisdYm1Drgw' alt='President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine delivers a blunt speech in Davos, Switzerland.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Frozen assets: Zelenskyy criticized the European Union for not using frozen Russian assets in Europe to help fund Ukraine, calling it a sign of stalled decision-making.</li><li>Missile debate: He said some European leaders have urged him to avoid raising specific long-range weapons requests with Washington, citing Tomahawk and Taurus missiles as examples.</li><li>Cease-fire security: Zelenskyy publicly thanked U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron for offering post-cease-fire security guarantees, while still pressing for stronger collective action.</li><li>Oil enforcement: He urged tougher action against Russian oil shipments near European shores and pointed to recent seizures of Russian oil tankers, with Macron confirming a vessel seizure during the Davos session.</li><li>Broader diplomacy: In contrasting Europe’s pace with Washington’s “bold steps,” Zelenskyy referenced U.S. actions related to Venezuela and Iran as examples of faster, more decisive policy moves.</li></ul><blockquote>Europe loves to discuss the future, but avoids taking action today - Volodymyr Zelenskyy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Ukraine): He argued Europe needs more unity and urgency, and said U.S. security guarantees are essential and he discussed them with President Trump.
