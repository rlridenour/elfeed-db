Foxconn's facility in Hyderabad, India is preparing to double monthly AirPods output and more than double its workforce as Apple accelerates accessory manufacturing in the country, the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/foxconn-arm-to-amplify-output-of-airpods-with-line-overhaul/articleshow/124792376.cms"><em>Economic Times</em></a> reports.<br/>

Foxconn will apparently raise capacity at its Kongara Kalan plant from more than 100,000 units per month to 200,000 units per month by overhauling five existing assembly lines and installing additional equipment that is being transferred from facilities in Vietnam. The site began production of AirPods in April after machinery and tooling were relocated.<br/>

The workforce of around 2,000 employees is also likely to rise to 5,000 in the next six to eight months. The current assembly mix at the plant includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a>.<br/>

The step-up in Hyderabad follows a temporary constraint in July, when AirPods production was hampered by a shortage of dysprosium after China tightened export controls on rare earth metals. The expansion of AirPods production in India is part of a broader strategic production shift in Apple's supply chain as it diversifies its manufacturing across different countries.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/">Foxconn</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/25/apple-to-make-more-airpods-in-india/">Apple Preparing to Make More AirPods in India</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-to-make-more-airpods-in-india.2469793/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
