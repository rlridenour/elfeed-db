Recently many fonts are unusable in gimp because the underlying Pango library ceased to support bitmap fonts, resulting in the majority of fonts on my system being unusable by Gimp (including anything Adobe). When editing a form I filled out with gimp last year, I need to change all text fields (ie each field of the form) to one of the working fonts. This tedious task demands a more efficient solution if I&rsquo;m going to be doing it repeatedly; apparently, it might be time for learning gimp plugins.
