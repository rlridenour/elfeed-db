Poland's antitrust regulator is investigating whether Apple is restricting competition in the mobile ads market through its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/polish-antitrust-watchdog-investigates-apple-over-privacy-policy-2025-11-25/">Reuters</a></em>.<br/>

Introduced in April 2021 with the release of iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5, Apple's ATT framework requires that all apps on ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ ask for the user's consent before tracking their activity across other apps. Apps that wish to track a user based on their device's unique advertising identifier can only do so if the user allows it when prompted.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said the feature was designed to protect users and not to advantage the company. It has been unsurprisingly unpopular with advertisers and data brokers. <br/>
<br/>
Poland's anti-monopoly office, UOKiK, suspects that Apple's ATT framework could be favoring the company's own ads service by limiting the ability of third-party apps to collect user data for personalized ads.<br/>
<blockquote>"We suspect that the ATT policy may have misled users about the level of privacy protection while simultaneously increasing Apple’s competitive advantage over independent publishers," UOKiK President Tomasz Chrostny was quoted as saying in a statement. "Such practices may constitute an abuse of dominant position."</blockquote>If the regulator finds its suspicions to be warranted, Apple could face a fine of up to 10% of its annual turnover in Poland.<br/>
<br/>
In an emailed statement to <em>Reuters</em>, Apple said: <br/>
<blockquote>"It is no surprise that the data tracking industry continues to oppose our efforts to give users back control over their data, and now intense pressure could force us to withdraw this feature, to the detriment of European consumers."<br/>
<br/>
"We will work with the Polish competition authority to ensure Apple can continue to offer users this valuable privacy tool."</blockquote>Regulators in Germany, Italy, and Romania have opened similar probes to examine whether the privacy feature violates competition rules by impeding access to essential data for advertising while reinforcing Apple's own position in the digital ad market. <br/>
