<p>Today I learned about using zero-knowledge proofs in the context of passwords. These are my rough-and-ready notes from reading. Apparently OpenSSL has an implementation of the SRP algorithm.</p>

<p>In this example Peggy is the person who wishes to <em>prove</em> knowledge about something to Victor, the <em>verifier</em>. Peggy is proving that she knows some value

  \(x\)
</span>
, but she doesn&rsquo;t want to reveal the value of <span>
  \(x\)
</span>
.</p>
<p>Peggy and Victor need to share a large prime <span>
  \(p\)
</span>
 and a generator <span>
  \(g\)
</span>
. (This means that <span>
  \(g\)
</span>
 and <span>
  \(p\)
</span>
 must be relatively prime.)</p>
<p>Peggy computes <span>
  \(g^x \mod{p} = y\)
</span>
 and sends <span>
  \(y\)
</span>
 to Victor.</p>
<p>Peggy generates a random number <span>
  \(r\)
</span>
 and computes <span>
  \(C = g^r \mod{p}\)
</span>
 and sends <span>
  \(C\)
</span>
 to Victor.</p>
<p>Victor randomly issues one of two challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>Victor asks for <span>
  \(r\)
</span>
. Peggy sends him <span>
  \(r\)
</span>
 and Victor verifies that <span>
  \(C\)
</span>
 matches <span>
  \(g^r \mod{p}\)
</span>
.</li>
<li>Victor asks for <span>
  \(s = (x &#43; r) \mod{(p-1)}\)
</span>
. Peggy computes this and sends the result to Victor. Victor checks that <span>
  \(g^s \equiv (C \cdot y) \mod{p}\)
</span>
.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat process <span>
  \(n\)
</span>
 times to drive the probability that Peggy was just guessing to <span>
  \(\frac{1}{2^n}\)
</span>
.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article has a good explanation for how an attacker could not mimic knowing <span>
  \(x\)
</span>
 with this interactive proof.</p>

</h3>
<p>The last step works because</p>
<span>
  \(\begin{aligned}
C \cdot y &amp;\equiv g^r \cdot g^x &amp;\mod{p} \\
          &amp;\equiv g^{r &#43; x \mod{p-1}} &amp;\mod{p}
\end{aligned}\)
</span>

<p>When working <span>
  \(\mod{p}\)
</span>
, operations on combining exponents are <span>
  \(\mod{p-1}\)
</span>
. This is a consequence of Fermat&rsquo;s Little Theorem. Proof:</p>
<span>
  \(a^e = a^{p-1} \cdot a^{p-1} \cdot a^{p-1} \cdots a^n\)
</span>

<p>Where <span>
  \(a^{p-1}\cdot a^{p-1} \cdots a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod{p}\)
</span>
 by Fermat&rsquo;s theorem, and <span>
  \(n &lt; p\)
</span>
 and <span>
  \(e = m(p-1) &#43; n\)
</span>
 by the division algorithm. Therefore,
<span>
  \(n \equiv e \pmod{p-1}\)

<p>The above framework is not useful as-is for password authentication.</p>
<p>There is a method for verifying that a user knows a password without revealing the password to the server. The standard is called &ldquo;SRP&rdquo; (Secure Remote Password) and there&rsquo;s at least a version 6. As far as I can tell, version 6 is the most up-to-date version as of writing.</p>

<p>Shared: large safe prime <span>
  \(N\)
</span>
 (suggested that <span>
  \(N = 2 * p &#43; 1\)
</span>
 where <span>
  \(p\)
</span>
 is prime) and primitive root <span>
  \(g\)
</span>
. (I.e., <span>
  \(N\)
</span>
 and <span>
  \(g\)
</span>
 must be relatively prime.)</p>
<p>In this algorithm, the values <span>
  \(a\)
</span>
 and <span>
  \(b\)
</span>
 will be randomly generated. At the end, both parties will have a secret key <span>
  \(K\)
</span>
 that they share.</p>
<ol>
<li>Client sends identifier <span>
  \(I\)
</span>
 to Server.</li>
<li>Server looks up the salt and the verification token <span>
  \((s,v)\)
</span>
 associated with <span>
  \(I\)
</span>
 and sends just <span>
  \(s\)
</span>
 to Client.</li>
<li>Client computes hash of salt, ID, and password <span>
  \(x = H(s, I, P)\)
</span>
.</li>
<li>Client generates a random value <span>
  \(a\)
</span>
 and computes <span>
  \(A = g^a\)
</span>
. Client sends <span>
  \(A\)
</span>
 to Server.</li>
<li>Server and client compute <span>
  \(k = H(N, g)\)
</span>
. This is an enhancement from the older SRP-6 algorithm.</li>
<li>Server generates a random value <span>
  \(b\)
</span>
 and computes <span>
  \(B = kv &#43; g^b\)
</span>
. Server sends <span>
  \(B\)
</span>
 to client.</li>
<li>Server and Client both compute <span>
  \(u = H(A,B)\)
</span>
. This is called the <em>scrambler</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now both parties have access to <span>
  \(A, B, k, u\)
</span>
 and <span>
  \(g, N\)
</span>
 of course. With this they can each create a shared session key:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Client computation</dt>
<dd><span>
  \(K = (B-kg^x) ^ {(a &#43; ux)}\)
</span>
</dd>
<dt>Server computation</dt>
<dd><span>
  \(K = (Av^u)^b\)
</span>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The server and client must now both verify that they have the same value <span>
  \(K\)
</span>
. One simple way to do this is to hash <span>
  \(K\)
</span>
 (potentially with some other salting information like <span>
  \(A\)
</span>
 and <span>
  \(B\)
</span>
) and transmit that. Example from the paper:</p>
<span>
  \( \begin{aligned}
 M_1 &amp;= H(A,B,K) \\
 M_2 &amp;= H(A,M_1,K)
\end{aligned}\)
</span>

<p>The Client computes <span>
  \(M_1\)
</span>
 and sends it to the server. The server should have enough information to recompute this value. Once that&rsquo;s done, the server can compute <span>
  \(M_2\)
</span>
 and send that back to the Client. (This last step is optional.) Now both parties know that they&rsquo;ve got the right key. Use <span>
  \(K\)
</span>
 as the session token.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article mentions that it is important that the client send its proof of <span>
  \(K\)
</span>
 (i.e., the proof is the value <span>
  \(M_1\)
</span>
) <em>first</em>, and that the server should <em>not</em> reply with <span>
  \(M_2\)
</span>
 if verification fails.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the communication flow would look like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Client <span>
  \(I\)
</span>
 → Server</li>
<li>Server <span>
  \(g,N,s,B\)
</span>
 → Client</li>
<li>Client <span>
  \(A, M_1\)
</span>
 → Server</li>
<li>Server <span>
  \(M_2\)
</span>
 → Client</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the Server and Client can communicate using secret key <span>
  \(K\)
</span>
, which was only granted to the Client because it had the password that corresponded to the stored verifier <span>
  \(v\)
</span>
 on the server.</p>
