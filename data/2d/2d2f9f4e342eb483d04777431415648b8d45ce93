<p id="p2"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/caffeine-tracker-alyx/id6473840226" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alyx</a> is a new caffeine tracking app for the iPhone by Jordan Morgan that&rsquo;s simple, fun, and flexible all at once. It&rsquo;s a great example of marrying Apple&rsquo;s latest design language with recent technologies in a way that serves its users incredibly well.</p>

<p id="p4">The app has just one view and a couple of prominent Liquid Glass buttons for logging caffeine consumption and accessing settings. That&rsquo;s balanced visually by a bar at the top that remains on-screen as you scroll, showing your current caffeine intake, how many milligrams of caffeine you can still consume before reaching your self-imposed limit, and a &lsquo;Last Call&rsquo; button that tells you the latest time you can have caffeine without interrupting your sleep at night. The &lsquo;Last Call&rsquo; button opens a view with an explanation of how the time is calculated, an option to set an alarm for your Last Call, and a &lsquo;Learn More&rsquo; button that opens a fun terminal-style view with even more data.</p>

<p id="p6">Most of the time, you&rsquo;ll remain in the app&rsquo;s main view, which summarizes the data you enter. You can add caffeine using a series of categorized preset drinks, manually punching in the number of milligrams of caffeine you&rsquo;ve consumed, or using Apple Intelligence to describe a drink and get an estimate of its caffeine content. You can also define custom drinks and log them using a Siri Shortcut, the Action Button tied to an App Shortcut, or a shortcut you create yourself. You can also use Visual Lookup to get an estimate of the caffeine in a drink based on a photo. The app offers a lot of options for logging caffeine, but that&rsquo;s good because it covers a wide range of potential contexts inside and outside the app where you might want to add a drink, lowering the barrier to recording them.</p>

<p id="p8">The rest of Alyx&rsquo;s main view includes:</p>
<ul id="ul9"><li>a graph that can be switched between your daily, weekly, and annual caffeine intake, </li>
<li>a handful of glanceable daily and weekly stats, </li>
<li>a sleep forecast that tells you how much sleep you might lose based on your caffeine intake,</li>
<li>more detail about the individual drinks you&rsquo;ve logged for the current day,</li>
<li>a different graph depicting your rate of caffeine intake over the past year,</li>
<li>your annual caffeine intake measured in espresso shots, and</li>
<li>a Hall of Shame that measures your top intake by month, week, day, and entry.</li>
</ul><p id="p10">It&rsquo;s also worth noting that Alyx includes eight small- and medium-sized Home Screen widgets to track your caffeine intake, a Lock Screen widget for logging caffeine, and a very long list of Shortcuts actions.</p>

<p id="p12">It&rsquo;s a lot of data, but it&rsquo;s presented in clear card-style groupings that are broken up with just enough explanation of what you&rsquo;re looking at to make everything understandable. Behind the cards is Liquid Glass&rsquo; familiar frosted effect backed by subtle areas of color that make the UI feel more dynamic than scrolling a plain list of graphs and numbers. It looks great and adds vibrancy that fits in with the app&rsquo;s touches of humor from its coffee drink mascot, Alyx.</p>
<p id="p13">I often find myself in stretches where I know I&rsquo;m consuming too much caffeine but find it hard to break the habit. Alyx offers the ability to get control of that sort of thing in a way that&rsquo;s inviting. The app is fun to use and makes it dead simple to keep up with tracking, too. I highly recommend giving it a try.</p>
<p id="p14">Alyx <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/caffeine-tracker-alyx/id6473840226" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available in the App Store for the iPhone</a> as a free download with a subscription that&rsquo;s $1.99/month, $9.99/year, or a $24.99 one-time payment.</p>
