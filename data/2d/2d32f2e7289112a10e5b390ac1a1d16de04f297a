It's only been two months since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> launched, but rumors don't take breaks. We're already hearing details about the next-generation iOS 27 update, which Apple will introduce in June 2026 before launching it in September 2026.<br/>
<br/>

We've rounded up all of the rumors that we've heard so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="foldable_features">Foldable Features</h2><br/>
In 2026, Apple plans to launch the first foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, a device that could be called the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold. Rumors suggest that it will feature a 5.5-inch display when folded, and a 7.8-inch display when it's opened up like a book.<br/>
<br/>
An &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a larger display that also folds will require some major updates to iOS, and iOS 27 will focus on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/21/ios-27-prioritize-foldable-iphone-features/">building new interfaces</a> and experiences made for a larger display.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't heard specifics on how Apple will tweak iOS to accommodate the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold, but we could see some iPad-like options such as side bars and perhaps even multitasking views with support for multiple windows.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="bug_fixes">Bug Fixes</h2><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/23/ios-27-two-key-upgrades/">has described iOS 27</a> as a "Snow Leopard" update, suggesting that Apple will focus on improving underlying performance and quality rather than introducing major new functionality. Apple engineers are reportedly going through &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; to look for bloat, bugs, and any other issues impacting performance.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="liquid_glass">Liquid Glass</h2><br/>
iOS 27 might include refinements for the Liquid Glass design that Apple introduced with &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. There have already been some changes in the iOS 26.1 and iOS 26.2 updates, but iOS 27 will provide Apple with the opportunity to make larger adjustments.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence">Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
We're supposed to get the much smarter version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> in an iOS 26.4 update planned for spring 2026, but it's likely even more <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> capabilities will follow in iOS 27.<br/>
<br/>
We don't know specifics yet, but &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features could expand to additional apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is working on a "World Knowledge" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/03/llm-siri-with-search-early-2026/">Siri search feature</a> that would provide information on general search queries, which will likely be included in &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s iOS 26.4 update. If it's not in iOS 26.4, the add-on &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; feature could instead come in iOS 27.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="siri">Siri</h2><br/>
With iOS 27, Apple could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/siri-redesign-report/">update Siri's design</a>. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will get its major overhaul in iOS 26.4, but a new visual look is supposedly planned for iOS 27. There are no specifics about what the redesign might entail, but rumors linked to Apple's upcoming tabletop robot suggest that the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-launching-robot-virtual-companion-in-2027/">might introduce</a> a version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that's more animated, similar to the Mac Finder logo. That more animated version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could also come to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="health+">Health+</h2><br/>
Apple is rumored to be developing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/apple-health-plus-rumored-to-launch-next-year/">a paid Health+ service</a> with nutrition planning and medical suggestions, and we could see that introduced as part of iOS 27.<br/>
<br/>
The medical tool would explain different health metrics and trends from the Health app, offering up personalized guidance for health improvement.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_satellite_features">New Satellite Features</h2><br/>
Apple is working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/09/apple-developing-new-satellite-features/">several new satellite features</a> for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and it's possible some features could be introduced as soon as 2027. Timing on Apple's satellite improvements is unclear, though, and behind-the-scenes updates from Apple's satellite partner Globalstar are required.<br/>
Rumored features:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> via satellite</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> in Messages via satellite</li><br/>
 <li>Satellite API framework for third-party apps</li><br/>
 <li>Satellite over 5G</li><br/>
 <li>Satellite connectivity without the need for a view of the sky</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Some of these features might require new hardware, but options like &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; via satellite would not require components beyond what's available now.<br/>
<br/>
