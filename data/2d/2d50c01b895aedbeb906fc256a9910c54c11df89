As it did <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/26/iphone-17-usb-c-charging-speed-test/">with the iPhone 17</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/iphone-17-pro-max-usb-c-charging-speed-test/">iPhone 17 Pro Max</a>, ChargerLAB has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mENbJIRIvKA">tested the iPhone Air's USB-C charging speeds</a> with a variety of Apple chargers.<br/>

In the test, the iPhone Air reached a peak charging speed of around 18W to 19W.<br/>
<br/>
For comparison, ChargerLAB found the standard iPhone 17 reached a peak of 27W to 28W, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max reached a peak of around 36W.<br/>

Like the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max, Apple says the iPhone Air can be charged up to 50% in 30 minutes with a compatible 20W or higher charger. For comparison, Apple says the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max can charge up to 50% in 20 minutes, so the iPhone Air charges a bit slower. However, slower charging also means less heat will be generated, which is good for long-term battery health.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chargerlab/">ChargerLab</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/30/iphone-air-usb-c-charging-speeds-tested/">iPhone Air&#039;s USB-C Charging Speeds Tested With Apple Chargers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-airs-usb-c-charging-speeds-tested-with-apple-chargers.2468023/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
