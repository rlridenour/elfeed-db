With the release candidate, Apple provided release notes, so we have a more complete look at the new features that are included in the update, including those that weren't found during the beta testing period.<br/>

The update adds a new wallpaper that matches this year's Pride Apple Watch Band, along with a new parental alert when a child is able to bypass the Screen Time passcode. Apple also added support for carrier-provided satellite services on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 13, and a feature for using an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to purchase content within the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app on a third-party device.<br/>
