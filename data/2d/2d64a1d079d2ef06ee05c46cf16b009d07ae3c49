<p>Years ago, back in 2016, we featured a <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/the-1950-superman-poster-that-urged-kids-to-stick-up-for-all-americans.html">1950 Superman poster that urged students to defend the American way and fight discrimination everywhere</a>. Today, we present&nbsp;another chapter from Superman’s little-known history as a Civil Rights defender.</p>
<p>The year is 1946. World War II has come to an end. And now membership in the Ku Klux Klan starts to rise&nbsp;again. Enter&nbsp;<a title="Stetson Kennedy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stetson_Kennedy">Stetson Kennedy</a>, a human rights activist, who manages to infiltrate the KKK and then figures out an ingenious way to take them down. He contacts the producers of<em>&nbsp;</em>the popular<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Superman_(radio)">Adventures of</a></em>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Superman_(radio)"><i>Superman </i>radio show</a><i>, </i>and pitches them on a new storyline: Superman meets and defeats the KKK. Needing a new enemy to vanquish, the producers greenlight the idea.</p>

<p>The 16-episode series, “The Clan of the Fiery Cross,” aired in June 1946 and effectively chipped away at the Klan’s mystique, gradually revealing their secret codewords and rituals. Listen to the episodes above. And take heart in knowing this: According to Stephen J. Dubner and Steven Levitt, the authors of <a href="http://amzn.to/2fWpuys"><em>Freakonomics</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>The Clan of the Fiery Cross</em> was “the greatest single contributor to the weakening of the Ku Klux Klan.” Mocked and trivialized, the Klan’s numbers went back into decline.</p>
