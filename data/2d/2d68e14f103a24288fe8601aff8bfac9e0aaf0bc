If you are a millennial or younger, you have probably heard the someone say "It's NOT a PC, it's a Mac!" during your lifetime. It was most certainly said by a person who wanted to feel superior to you. The person in question was probably not a computer person either, but parroted terms they had heard from people who were actually intelligent. I heard it from those types, and it made me want to stay away from Apple for years. You may think it was just sheer arrogance from the Apple cult, but today we will discuss the historical reasons for the distinction. We will also discuss why it made less and less sense over the years, and why it might make some sense again now.
