According to a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/24/ios-18-6-code-hints-at-airtag-2-but-when-is-it-coming/"><em>9to5Mac</em> report</a> this week, citing reliable sources, Apple is now planning to release the AirTag 2 in September or later this year. If so, the updated accessory could be announced at the iPhone 17 event in less than three months from now.<br/>

The report also said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/18/apple-releases-ios-18-6-public-beta/">iOS 18.6 beta</a> code hints at the upcoming software update being compatible with the AirTag 2, when it is released.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the report said that the AirTag 2 will provide alerts for both low and very low battery levels. You can already see if the current AirTag's battery level is low in the Find My app, but it sounds like there will now be two tiers of alerts.<br/>
<br/>
<em>9to5Mac</em> speculated that this change could hint at the AirTag 2 featuring a rechargeable battery. However, in a November 2024 edition of his <em>Power On</em> newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the next AirTag would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/">"certainly not" be equipped with a rechargeable battery</a>, suggesting that Apple will stick with a replaceable battery.<br/>
<br/>
In that same newsletter, Gurman said that Apple was aiming to release the AirTag 2 around the middle of 2025, which sounded more like June or July. So, if <em>9to5Mac</em> is accurate about the accessory's launch timeframe now being September or later this year, then customers will have to wait a little longer for it than expected.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever it launches, the AirTag 2 is rumored to feature up to 3× longer item tracking range compared to the current AirTag. Gurman expects the AirTag 2 to look similar to the current model, but he said the built-in speaker will be more difficult to remove, which would make it harder to covertly stalk people with the accessory.<br/>

Apple released the current AirTag <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-april-event-recap/">in April 2021</a>, so it is now more than four years old. It debuted at an event alongside the iMac with the M1 chip, the iPad Pro with the M1 chip, a new Apple TV, and a purple color for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/9to5mac-com/">9to5Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/">AirTag</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/25/airtag-2-september-or-later-rumor/">AirTag 2 Now Rumored to Launch in September or Later This Year With New Battery Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airtag-2-now-rumored-to-launch-in-september-or-later-this-year-with-new-battery-feature.2459661/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
