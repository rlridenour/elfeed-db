<p>What do you do as a philosophy professor? What does it take to get a job as a philosophy professor? To get tenure? What is teaching like? What is a philosophy department like as a work environment? How much does college or university administration affect your work? What are plusses and minuses of the job? <span id="more-55340"></span></p>
<p>When these and related questions are taken up, it seems they are often answered with a certain type of institution in mind: R1 Universities. These are universities that, according to the <a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a>, have &#8220;very high research spending and doctorate production.&#8221;</p>
<p>The focus on these types of institutions is not all that surprising, as a good number of people thinking about these questions are graduate students in philosophy, that is, people who by and large are at such institutions.</p>
<p>Currently in the US there are <a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/institutions/?inst=&amp;research2025%5B%5D=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">187 R1 universities</a>. But, according to Carnegie, there are over 3900 institutions of higher education in the country. Even taking into account that there are generally quite a bit more philosophers per R1 university than there are at the average institution of higher education, there are still plenty of philosophers who work at non-R1 institutions.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/24/a-trove-of-data-about-philosophy-departments-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data from Humanities Indicators</a> published earlier this year, 744 departments in the US award degrees in philosophy. Of these, 200 (27%) award graduate degrees, with 120 (16%) awarding PhDs.</p>
<p>Across all of these institutions, there are around 8,620  full- and part-time philosophy faculty members. Fewer than half teach in departments with graduate students:</p>

<p>Given these numbers, it may be that the conventional answers to the questions at the start of this post provide a somewhat biased picture of the profession of philosophy.</p>
<p>So I thought it would be a good idea to open up a space for people to identify particular distortions or misconceptions about various aspects of professional philosophy that may have arisen from overgeneralizing from a nonrepresentative sample of professional philosophy positions.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/10/16/research-university-biased-perceptions-of-professional-philosophy/">Research-University-Biased Perceptions of Professional Philosophy</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
