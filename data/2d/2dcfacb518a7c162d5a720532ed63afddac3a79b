It's been four months since the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> came out, and it hasn't exactly been a resounding success. Sales are reportedly so low that Apple is delaying the next-generation model. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera shares what it's been like using Apple's thinnest and lightest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> on a daily basis over the last few months.<br/>

With its super thin design, the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; still impresses even months later. It's much lighter than the other &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, and a pleasure to use because of it. The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is Apple's best one-handed smartphone, plus it impresses everyone who tries it out.<br/>

The frosted glass texture is attractive, and thanks to that titanium frame, it's durable. The glass resists fingerprints, plus it's not slippery, so it can be used without a case. That's a good thing, since a case tends to ruin the ultra thin feel. The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is all glass, though, so it's still breakable if dropped and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ is recommended.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; has the smallest battery in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup, and there was a lot of concern that it wouldn't last all day. As long as you're not using it for high-end gaming, the battery is totally fine. Dan hasn't had a problem with battery life for day-to-day activities like browsing social media, YouTube, navigating, and using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>.<br/>

If you're someone who only uses the Wide camera on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, you might not miss the Ultra Wide or Telephoto lenses, but having only a single-lens rear camera is one of the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;'s major downsides. You get 1x and 2x zoom, but no 0.5x mode, no macro lens, and no 5x telephoto lens. It's definitely a dealbreaker for some people.<br/>
<br/>
There's also only a single speaker, and while it's fine for use in quiet rooms, if you like to use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for things like listening to music in the shower, it might not be good enough.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest thing wrong with the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is the price tag. Sure, it's light, thin, and has an impressive design, but it's &#36;999. For &#36;200 less, you can get the standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; with two cameras and near identical performance, and for &#36;100 more, you can get the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, which has three cameras and faster performance. The only sacrifice is thinness, and it's clear that most people aren't willing to pay more to lose features for a thin and light design.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, it's not entirely clear when a new &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is coming out. Rumors originally suggested we'd get the second-generation model in the fall of 2026, but sales were below expectations, so Apple is holding back on a new model to make some changes.<br/>

The next &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; could have a second camera and display improvements like a smaller <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> to make it more appealing, with a potential launch happening in spring 2027.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/06/iphone-air-four-month-review/">iPhone Air Review: Four Months Later, is Apple&#039;s Thinnest iPhone Worth &#36;999?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-review-four-months-later-is-apples-thinnest-iphone-worth-999.2477302/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
