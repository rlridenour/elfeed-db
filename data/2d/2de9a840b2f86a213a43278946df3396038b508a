<p>Brazil’s Supreme Federal Court has ordered former president Jair Bolsonaro to begin serving a prison sentence of more than 27 years for leading a failed effort to stay in power after losing the 2022 election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The ruling came after Bolsonaro exhausted all remaining appeals against his September conviction for participating in a plan to block the transfer of power, which prosecutors said included discussions of using the military and an alleged plot to kill Lula, though senior commanders ultimately withheld support. Bolsonaro, who had been under house arrest, was moved on Saturday to a specially prepared room at federal police headquarters in Brasília, where he will remain as he starts his sentence while additional cases involving his conduct in office and in the post‑election period continue moving through the courts. Supporters and some right‑wing politicians argue he is being persecuted, while others in Brazil and abroad see the decision as a sign that institutions are enforcing accountability for attempts to undermine democratic rules.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SCbKqHQLbRuX7K010PzJQ5X9pmF3Hmoc_eyKXHJknclM7Qv6fFFzmlvB_kd5mmNMqMGHxoiFSOD9ENMt8bBqFmZi6pdpUnnTOk61eytMf2HA_-CbShAa8G0onFWDe1jIonhZ7vmqZZBgtz5WqN8Pmkh5K8i7olIIog9QBxosaq43_EOLF_FzURmofg8yTGx4IvJR8g4dJmUIUGM8tBTiiiQ13SEhIlvwQVo3PH-EFaJ05gN1hZZkJyAPzoODjNTW0xtpS4DCLxr6yk-pCw' alt='Jair Bolsonaro leaving a hospital in Brasília earlier this year, before the Supreme Court ordered him to begin serving his prison sentence.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Cell conditions: Bolsonaro has been placed in an officers’ room at Brasília’s federal police headquarters, described as a small secured space equipped with a television, mini-fridge and air conditioning, separated from the general prison population for safety reasons.</li><li>Alleged escape plan: Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered Bolsonaro’s pre-emptive detention after the former president allegedly tampered with his ankle monitor using a soldering iron, citing signs he might seek refuge near his home, possibly at the nearby U.S. embassy, during a vigil organized by his son.</li><li>Co-defendants sentenced: Five of Bolsonaro’s allies, including senior military officers and former ministers, also began long prison terms ranging from 19 to 26 years for their roles in the coup plot, while former intelligence chief Alexandre Ramagem, sentenced to 16 years, has been declared a fugitive after leaving for the United States.</li><li>Military status in question: Alongside the prison term, the Supreme Court instructed a military tribunal to decide whether Bolsonaro should be stripped of his army captain rank, a step that would further distance the armed forces from his political project.</li><li>Trump’s involvement: Some coverage notes that President Trump publicly criticized the Brazilian court’s decision and urged leniency for Bolsonaro, but the Supreme Court proceeded with the sentence despite this international political pressure.</li></ul><blockquote>I acted out of paranoia induced by medication - Jair Bolsonaro</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Jair Bolsonaro: Bolsonaro maintains his innocence and portrays himself as a victim of political persecution, arguing that prosecutors and Supreme Court justices have targeted him and his allies for their right-wing agenda rather than for genuine crimes.
