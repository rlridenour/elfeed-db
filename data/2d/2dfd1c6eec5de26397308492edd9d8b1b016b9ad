<p>Larry David, in a column for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He loved that story, especially the part where Hitler shot the dog before it got back into the car. Then a beaming Hitler said, “Hey, if I can kill Jews, Gypsies and homosexuals, I can certainly kill a dog!” That perhaps got the biggest laugh of the night — and believe me, there were plenty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been reliably informed that, having <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/13/bill-maher-on-his-dinner-at-the-white-house-with-donald-trump">linked approvingly</a> to Bill Maher’s “book report” on his dinner with Trump, I must also link to David’s report of dinner with Adolf.</p>
