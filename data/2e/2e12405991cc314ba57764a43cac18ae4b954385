<p id="p1">I <a href="https://www.david-smith.org/blog/2025/03/17/optimism/" rel="noopener noreferrer">loved this post by David Smith</a> on his decision to remain optimistic about Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/apple-readies-dramatic-design-overhauls-for-ios-19-ipados-19-and-macos-16" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored</a> iOS 19 redesign despite, well, <em>you know</em>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/apple-s-siri-chief-calls-ai-delays-ugly-and-embarrassing-promises-fixes" rel="noopener noreferrer">everything</a>:</p>

  Optimism isn&rsquo;t enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is a feeling, optimism is a choice. I have much less of the enthusiastic feelings these days about my relationship to Apple and its technologies (discussed <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/312" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> on Under the Radar 312), but I can still choose to optimistically look for the positives in any situation. Something I&rsquo;ve learned as I&rsquo;ve aged is that pessimism feels better in the moment, but then slowly rots you over time. Whereas optimism feels foolish in the moment, but sustains you over time.

<p id="p3">I&rsquo;ve always disliked the word &ldquo;enthusiast&rdquo; (talk about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2011/07/attribution_and_credit" rel="noopener noreferrer">a throwback</a>), and I&rsquo;ve been frequently criticized for <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/living-with-ios-7/" rel="noopener noreferrer">choosing</a> the more <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/" rel="noopener noreferrer">optimistic</a> approach in covering Apple over the years. But David is right: pessimism feels better in the short term (and performs better if you&rsquo;re good at writing headlines or designing YouTube thumbnails), but is not a good long-term investment. (Of course, when the optimism is also gone for good&hellip;well, that&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-ipads-sweet-solution/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a different kind of problem</a>.)</p>
<p id="p4">But back to David&rsquo;s thoughts on the iOS 19 redesign. He lists this potential reason to be optimistic about having to redesign his apps:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  It would provide a point of differentiation for my app against other apps who wouldn&rsquo;t adopt the new design language right away (either large companies which have their own design system or laggards who wouldn&rsquo;t prioritize it).
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">He&rsquo;s correct: the last time Apple rolled out a major redesign of iOS, they <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-launches-designed-for-ios-7-app-store-section/" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched a dedicated section</a> on the App Store which, on day one, featured indie apps updated for iOS 7 such as OmniFocus, Twitterrific, Reeder 2, Pocket Casts 4, and Perfect Weather. It lasted for months. Twelve years later<sup id="fnref-78110-fiveYears"><a href="#fn-78110-fiveYears" class="jetpack-footnote" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a></sup>, I doubt that bigger companies will be as slow as they were in 2013 to adopt Apple&rsquo;s new design language, but more agile indie developers will undoubtedly have an advantage here.</p>
<p id="p7">He also writes:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote8"><p>
  Something I regularly remind myself as I look at new Apple announcements is that I never have the whole picture of what is to come for the platform, but Apple does. They know if things like foldable iPhones or HomeKit terminals are on the horizon and how a new design would fit in best with them. If you pay attention and try to read between the lines they often will provide the clues necessary to &ldquo;skate where the puck is going&rdquo; and be ready when new, exciting things get announced subsequently.

<p id="p9">This is the key point for me going into this summer&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/ios-reviews/" rel="noopener noreferrer">review season</a>. Just like when Apple introduced <a href="https://mrblog.org/2014/06/06/wwdc-ios-8-reading-between-the-lines/" rel="noopener noreferrer">size classes in iOS 8</a> at WWDC 2014 and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/10/" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched Slide Over and Split View</a> multitasking for the iPad (alongside <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first iPad Pro</a>) the next year, I have to imagine that changes in this year&rsquo;s design language will pave the way for an iPhone that unfolds into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a mini tablet</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-foldable-macos-prediction/" rel="noopener noreferrer">convertible Mac laptop</a>, App Intents on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/homepod-with-screen-after-wwdc-kuo/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a dedicated screen</a>, or more. So while I&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/on-apple-offering-an-abstraction-layer-for-ai-on-its-platforms/" rel="noopener noreferrer">not</a> <em>enthusiastic</em> about Apple&rsquo;s performance in AI or <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/apple-in-2024-the-six-colors-report-card/" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer relations</a>, I choose to be <em>optimistic</em> about the idea that this year&rsquo;s redesign may launch us into an exciting season of new hardware and apps for the next decade.</p>

Think about it this way: when iOS 7 was released, the App Store was only five years old.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref-78110-fiveYears" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8617;&#65038;</a>
