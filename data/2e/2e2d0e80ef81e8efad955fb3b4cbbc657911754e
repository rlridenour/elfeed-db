<p>Throughout history, communities that preserved old knowledge alongside new technology were happier, and more resilient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saturday, market day. The square at the center of the village bustles and boils with activity. Boys and girls have come from every farm, and wives and old men, too, with the last of the harvest’s produce to offer up in trade.</p>
<p>This system of barter is a quaint tradition, one that would never exist today, in our modern world of automobiles and radio broadcasts, tinned food, and electric lights. It’s war that has resurrected these cunning old ways; deprivation keeps the past alive.</p>
<p>—The Ragged Edge of Night, by Olivia Hawker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what if we could keep the best parts of old traditions alive, without the necessity that stems from conflict or scarcity?</p>
<p>We’ve already seen enough bare shelves, internet outages, and frozen bank accounts to know there’s likely to be a repeat. At times like that, no one will care about your pro-model iPhone or <span class="small-caps">16K</span> smart <span class="small-caps">TV</span>. And they certainly won’t care about any of my <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/06/ptpl-176-simple-obsidian-iphone-shortcuts" title="wikilink">plain text productivity</a> achievements!</p>

<p>People may, however, be interested in trading their garden produce for the preserves in the back of your cupboard, your ability to fix a leaking roof, or your grandmas’s kitchen remedy for removing splinters. The right kind of stuff<a href="#footnote-1FV5" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1FV5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> can be worth something, but a lot of it will be useless without the knowledge to put it to work.</p>
<p>My Mum was born a couple of years into World War 2. Here are some skills she said were normal then that are still worth learning today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mending (darning socks, Japanese sashiko for holes in clothing)</li>
<li>Upcycling (making a thing that you have into something you need more)</li>
<li>Gardening in both the ground and in containers, keeping a seed bank</li>
<li>Grind grain, make flat bread</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAD1w8NUeic" target="_blank">Twisting your own cordage</a><br>
</li>
<li>Making soap, candles</li>
<li>Make fire and learn how to cook over one</li>
<li>Foraging (safely) for food</li>
<li>Keep animals for food and clothing, kill and prepare your own meat / leather</li>
<li>Toilet paper alternatives (newspaper, bidet hose)</li>
<li>Cleaning your hair without shampoo</li>
<li>Schoolyard and other <a href="https://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Mancala.htm" target="_blank">traditional games</a> (knuckle bones, hoops, elastics)</li>
<li>Home remedies for mild complaints (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305417923002140" target="_blank">magnesium for burns</a>, <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/11/inktober-sting" title="wikilink">honey</a> for anti bacterial, grated raw potato and castor oil for removing splinters, peppermint for upset stomach)</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you can already do one of those things, maybe you know people who can do some of the others. Community is vital!</p>
<p>I learned how to make cordage last year from foraged materials. It’s an easy, practical skill. I’m not great at sashiko mending, but I can do it well enough to have saved several garments from the bin this year.</p>

<p>There’s nothing crazy-prepper about being quietly ready for an emergency.</p>
<p>While things still feel relatively normal, you can also consider <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/13/ptpl-177-plain-text-part-of-a-bigger-picture" title="wikilink">how to structure your digital life</a> so that your most important data isn’t inaccessible if your devices fail or the internet is down.</p>
<p>In an emergency, the things you put in place yesterday will see you through. When those things include ways to fill your basic physiological and safety needs, plus a good family and community support network, you’ll be able to keep going. To be part of the solution, rather than falling in a heap.</p>
