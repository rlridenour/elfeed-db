The "Your Tree on Battersea" campaign encourages participants to "express their creativity on &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;" by drawing and submitting original Christmas tree designs. Hosted by British comedian and presenter Munya Chawawa, the project will culminate with 24 winning public entries being displayed on Battersea Power Station's river-facing chimneys and wash towers, alongside digital artwork from artists and public figures, including Sir Stephen Fry and David Shrigley OBE. <br/>
<br/>
Submissions for Your Tree on Battersea open immediately and will be accepted until 11:59 p.m. on November 23, 2025. The winning entries will be unveiled on December 4 at 5 p.m. on Battersea Power Station's chimneys.<br/>
<br/>
To help participants create and submit their entries, Apple is hosting special 30-minute Today at Apple sessions across all 39 of its UK retail stores from November 6 to November 22. The company added that the same sessions will continue through December 22 "so that the public can get creative on &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> throughout the festive season." Participants can also submit their artwork from home using <a href="http://apple.com/uk/apple-christmas-trees">downloadable templates</a> provided by Apple.<br/>
