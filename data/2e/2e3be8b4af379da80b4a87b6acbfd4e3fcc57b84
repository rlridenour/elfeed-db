I've been deep in a solo TTRPG campaign for the last few days, and I want to give a quick shout out to <a href="https://ucmeumm.blogspot.com/2022/11/lets-talk-standalone-npc-dialogue.html">Let's Talk!</a> I'd heard some buzz around it recently and thought I'd give it a try over <a href="https://jeansenvaars.itch.io/scene-unfolding-machine">SUM</a>s character emulation oracles which I'd been using prior.

I've gotta say, so far I'm pretty impressed. The system is quite streamlined and abstract, which I thought would be a detriment, but actually it has been brilliant in giving me good dialogue prompts. And I can also fall back to the SUM oracles if needed as well. I'm going to look at <a href="https://ucmeumm.blogspot.com/2022/12/keeping-contact-standalone-social.html">Keeping Contact!</a> next to see if it's something else I can integrate into this campaign, since it also seems pretty interesting.
