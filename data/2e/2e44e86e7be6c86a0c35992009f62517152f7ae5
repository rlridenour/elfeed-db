<p>I&rsquo;ve had it with Orion&rsquo;s tabs. Since Zen has been a good experience on Linux so far, I decided to reinstall it on my Mac. To my surprise, workspaces did not sync even when turned on, so I ended up creating a new workspace. There&rsquo;s also the weird issue that Grammarly works on Mac, but not Linux.</p>
