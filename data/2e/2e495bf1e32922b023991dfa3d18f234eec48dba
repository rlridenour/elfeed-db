<p id="p1">Professional photographer Austin Mann published his annual tests of the new iPhone&rsquo;s cameras. This year, Mann traveled to the Dolomite Mountains in Northern Italy to bike and photograph the mountain landscapes.</p>
<p id="p2">It&rsquo;s probably not surprising that <a href="https://www.austinmann.com/trek/iphone-17-pro-camera-review-dolomites" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 17 Pro&rsquo;s telephoto cameras were a perfect match with the Dolomites</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  After extensively testing the iPhone 17 Pro camera system, I can confidently say the biggest improvement for photographers this year is the new 48MP 4x lens and the 8x telephoto. These focal lengths feel right and open up opportunities to capture fresh perspectives.

<p id="p4">Mann&rsquo;s photos are stunning. What stood out to me the most is the level of detail that can be captured with the 4x and 8x cameras. I spent some time testing this over the weekend myself and it&rsquo;s seriously impressive.</p>

<p id="p6">Mann is also <a href="https://www.austinmann.com/trek/iphone-17-pro-camera-review-dolomites" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fan of the new selfie camera</a>, using it to take selfies as he biked through the mountains:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote7"><p>
  This is one of those features that just works without any effort and will make everyone&rsquo;s selfies better, and many users won&rsquo;t even be aware of what it&rsquo;s doing. Just as I hoped, I can hold the iPhone in horizontal or vertical orientation and the camera automatically adjusts based on whether I&rsquo;m alone or surrounded by others.

<p id="p8">As always, it&rsquo;s worth scrolling through the entire post because the Dolomites are a beautiful mountain range that offered a lot of opportunities for Mann to show off the new iPhone 17 Pro&rsquo;s cameras.</p>
