<blockquote>
  <p>For more than a year, we’ve heard scattered complaints: problems
with Nisus Software’s website, particularly the user discussion
forum; slow or absent responses to support requests; assorted
bugs; and other issues. But earlier this week, on 22 October 2025,
the reports changed to: “Did you know the Nisus website is
completely down, and that Nisus Writer is no longer in the Mac App
Store? Does this mean Nisus is out of business?”</p>

<p>On the one hand: The site is back online as I write this. The
app still works. I’m writing the first draft of this article in
Nisus Writer Pro on a Mac running macOS 26 Tahoe, and it’s fine.
You can still download it and buy a license. At least one person
is actively involved in the company, to some extent. It’s
(mostly) alive!</p>

<p>On the other hand: All available evidence suggests that
development and support for Nisus Writer have ceased, and barring
some new information, its future is doubtful. It’s (mostly) dead!</p>

<p>I’m going to tell you what I know. (Well, <em>most</em> of what I know.)
I’m also going to speculate a bit, because despite my best
efforts, I have been unable to obtain verifiable information about
certain topics, though I have a pretty good idea of what’s likely
the case.</p>

<p>Seems like an ignominious demise for a once-great app. Nisus Writer has been an acclaimed Mac-only (and Mac-assed) word processor since 1989. I never got into it, but I could always see the appeal. Nisus had a macro language for automation and regex-style advanced search and replace. But when I wanted features like those, I wanted them in a plain text editor, not a word processor, so I got into BBEdit.</p>
