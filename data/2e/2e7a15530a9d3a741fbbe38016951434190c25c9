<blockquote>
  <p>Something jumped out at me in the macOS Tahoe segment of the WWDC keynote today: the Finder icon is reversed. […]</p>

<p>The Big Sur Finder icon has been with us ever since, and I hope Apple reverses course here.</p>

<p>I’m obviously joking about this being the biggest news of the day, but it really does feel just plain wrong to swap the dark/light sides. The Finder icon is more than an icon, it’s a logo, a brand.</p>
