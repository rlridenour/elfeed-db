<li>They’ve got freezable gel inside them</li>
<li>Put them in the freezer and then they’ll keep your ice cream from melting as you eat it</li>
<li>Also great for dips, veggies, you name it</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No but they can keep one cold (as long as you don’t mind slurping your marg a bit)</li>
</ul><h1>Chill Out</h1><p>Simply put: these are bowls lined with gel that can freeze. Clear enough?</p>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>Now, a big part of the marketing for these things hinges on their use as vessels for ice cream. And, obviously, there’s good reason for that. You want to enjoy a bowl of delicious ice cream on a hot day without having to risk brain freeze before the sun reduces it to crème anglaise?</p>
<p>These can help!</p>
<p>But there’s so much more you can do with them.</p>
<p>Like, let’s say you’re having people over for a little patio party.</p>
<p>You want to set out some snacks, right? Maybe a nice creamy spinach dip or some French onion dip. Delicious! As long as they don’t boil in the summer heat.</p>
<p>Same goes for veggies to dip in those dips. There’s just something weird about munching on lukewarm carrots.</p>
<p>Or, what if you’ve got gazpacho soup on offer? Even if you keep it inside, where it won’t get too hot, it’s still risky. After all, your guests will expect it to be chilled, so even if it only gets up to room temperature, it can burn someone’s mouth, because they won’t be expecting it.</p>
<p>Our point is: you can think of dozens of uses for these things.</p>
<p>And yet, most of these would not be considered <em>everyday</em> uses. You’re not having several patio parties a week. And while there are some stretches where you get a good tub of ice cream and want to enjoy some every evening after dinner, eventually you’ll run out and decide not to buy more for a little while for your tummy’s sake.</p>
<p>Which is what makes them the perfect Meh product.</p>
<p>Because you look over at Amazon, and you see that each one runs about 15 bucks, and you think, <em>Sure, I probably would use them occasionally, but not enough to justify spending that much.</em></p>
<p>Whereas, at $20 for 4, the math is less complicated. Even if you and your family use these things five times between when they’re delivered and the last truly warm day in September, that’s money well spent! (Not to mention, there’s always next year.)</p>
<p>So get some freezable bowls for a great price, whether you use them a lot or a little.</p>
