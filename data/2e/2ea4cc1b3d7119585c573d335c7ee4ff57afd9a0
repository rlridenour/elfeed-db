Accessing the full functionality of Apple's video editing, photo editing, audio editing, and iWork apps will require a Creator Studio subscription going forward, though Apple will continue to offer updates for the standalone versions of the apps. Some of the tools exclusive to Creator Studio:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Final Cut Pro</strong> - Transcript search that uses AI to search for the soundbite you're looking for, visual search for finding specific parts of a video, and beat detection improvements that make it easier to match a video to the rhythm of the music. There are also new dynamic titles, transitions, and graphic elements to improve visuals.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Logic Pro</strong> - There's an option to add a Session Player to a song that plays synth keyboard and synth bass parts in a variety of styles. AI can be used to analyze any audio or MIDI region to extract harmonic and chord information. Logic Pro's &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; sound packs and producer packs are also now available on Mac. Users have access to royalty-free loops, samples, and instruments.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Pixelmator Pro</strong> - The Creator Studio version of Pixelmator Pro features a Liquid Glass design, a new warp tool for reshaping layers, and warp-powered mockups for apparel and products. Pixelmator Pro for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is also entirely new.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>iWork</strong> - Includes a new content hub with Apple-curated royalty-free photos, premium templates, and themes. There are also options to generate and remix image creations right in documents, with a Super Resolution tool for upscaling images. In Keynote, you can generate slides and presenter notes using AI, while Magic Fill in Numbers runs a pattern analysis model across your data and suggests table contents for missing data.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
There is no way to subscribe to just a single Creator Studio app at a lower price, as Apple only offers an all-in-one subscription.<br/>
<br/>
Creator Studio can be downloaded from the iOS and Mac App Stores starting today. All new subscribers are eligible for a one-month free trial, and customers who purchase a new Mac or qualifying &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; model with an A16, A17 Pro, or M-series chip can get an extended three-month free trial.<br/>
<br/>
The Creator Studio membership can be shared with up to five family members on a linked Apple Account. Students and educators are able to subscribe to Creator Studio for &#36;2.99 per month or &#36;29.99 per year.<br/>
<br/>

Most of the apps require macOS 15.6 at a minimum and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip or newer for Mac use, though Pixelmator Pro requires a Mac with macOS 26.<br/>
<br/>
