<p id="p2">Today, Apple launched <a href="https://apps.apple.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">a web version of the App Store</a>, with a twist. I&rsquo;ll admit that this wasn&rsquo;t on my &ldquo;things Apple will do this fall&rdquo; bingo card. I&rsquo;ve wondered since the earliest days of the App Store why there wasn&rsquo;t a web version and concluded long ago that it just wasn&rsquo;t something Apple wanted to do. But here we are, so let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p id="p3">You&rsquo;ll find the new web-based App Store at <a href="https://apps.apple.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps.apple.com</a>, where you&rsquo;ll be greeted by a sort of amalgam of the App Stores on each of Apple&rsquo;s platforms. Along the left sidebar, you&rsquo;ll find the same Today, Games, Apps, and Arcade tabs found in the native App Stores. This is where Categories reside, too. One big difference is that in the top-left corner, you&rsquo;ll see what store you&rsquo;re viewing, which defaults to the iPhone even if you&rsquo;re on a different device. Click the drop-down label, and you can switch to another storefront.</p>

<p id="p5">An even bigger difference from the native App Stores is that you can&rsquo;t buy anything on the web. That&rsquo;s right: there&rsquo;s no way to log into your Apple account to download or buy anything. It&rsquo;s a browse-only experience.</p>
<p id="p6">The site looks great and is a fully responsive replica of the native App Store apps in just about every way, but in place of the usual &lsquo;Get&rsquo; or &lsquo;Buy&rsquo; buttons, there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;View&rsquo; button, which is replaced by a &lsquo;Share&rsquo; button when you go to an app&rsquo;s dedicated page. I really don&rsquo;t get it. At least on the Mac, there&rsquo;s a button to open an app in the Mac App Store, but the same isn&rsquo;t true on the iPhone and iPad.</p>

<p id="p8">Sure, you can always share an app to yourself on a device where you can buy it. But shouldn&rsquo;t the point of a web store be to allow you to make purchases when you&rsquo;re not on an Apple device or, for example, to buy a Mac app on your iPhone and have it waiting for you when you return to your Mac? I&rsquo;ve literally checked the site multiple times because I can&rsquo;t believe Apple built a storefront but left out the commerce part.</p>
<p id="p9">Look, the website is very nice and does a great job replicating the UI of the App Store, just like the web versions of Music, Maps, and iCloud do. I just wish I could buy something.</p>
