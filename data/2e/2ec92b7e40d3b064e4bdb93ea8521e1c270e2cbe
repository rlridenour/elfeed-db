</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A reflection on blogs and books read, letters sent, and the accretion of words.
</p>
        
<aside  role="note" class="margin">

<p><small>I wrote portions of this post in the middle of July, having now gotten around to
lifting it from my journal and developing more.</small></p>
</aside>

<p><i class="new-thought">Up before dawn</i>as Lacey was barking about something.  I did see in the
dark someone walking on our road, which is a quiet street.  I suspect they were
out walking their dog.</p>
<p>Instead of going back to bed at 5:30am, I decided to watch the sunrise from the
living room window.  Cupped between the dark distant treeline and the leafy dark
shape of a near tree, a pink pastel ember hints of a sun still an hour from the
treeline.  Colors not yet awake.</p>
<p><i class="new-thought">As I often do in the morning,</i>I sat down to read my daily feed of
information.  And read <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/07/17/read-what-we-see-when-we-read/">Read What We See When We Read</a>.  Some quotes from the
«What We See When We Read», as transcribed by Tracey (the author of the post):</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

The story of reading is a remembered story. When we read, we are immersed. And
the more we are immersed, the less we are able, in the moment, to bring our
analytic minds to bear upon the experience in which we are absorbed. Thus, when
we discuss the feeling of reading we are really talking about the memory of
having read.  And this memory of reading is a false memory.

</blockquote>

<p>And then there’s this one:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

We cherish the notion that books hold secrets; that books are <em>reticent</em>.

</blockquote>

<p>That quote sums up my book collecting mindset.  To learn of secrets, as though
in reading a novel or non-fiction, I have learned something that is worth
learning.  Why?  Because someone has taken the time to assemble the words and
send them forth into the world.</p>
<p>And there will inevitably be insights into the human condition.  Which alludes
to why I disdain this current era of “Generative <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction">Artificial Intelligence</a></span> (<abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Artificial Intelligence”" title="Other site-wide references of “Artificial Intelligence”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-AI">&#128214;</a></small>)
.”</p>
<p>And:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

<p>A novel invites our interpretive skills, but it also invites our minds to
wander.</p>
<p>Memory is made of the imaginary; the imaginary made of memory.</p>
<p>Words are effective, not because of what they carry in them, but for their
latent potential to unlock the accumulated experience of the reader. Words
“contain” meanings, but, more important, words potentiate meaning… This is a
word’s dormant power, brimming with pertinence.</p>


</blockquote>

<p>In Tracey’s post there is another quote…about reading the word <em>river</em>.  I’ll
replace that with <em>lake</em>.  For me, the quintessential lake of my past is
Shavehead; having swum in it since I was 5.  Each summer packing up and staying
a week at Camp Friedenswald.  There are other visits to lakes: Michigan on a few
occasions.  Maybe Wawasee.  And Brown Bay visits for fishing.  Now the lake just
out my window, which greets me each and every day.</p>
<p>And as I read the word <em>lake</em> I receive that with all of the potential energies
and memories of each visit to a lake.  These are personal memories.  Ones in
which an author, invoking a <em>lake</em>, teases out of me.  Helping me revisit those
memories and mix within them that which they are writing.  Maybe just bringing a
thimble full of <em>lake</em> to the larger reservoir; but invariably changing the
composition.</p>
<p><i class="new-thought">This year,</i>Jenny (my partner) and I have joined our local library’s
reading competition.  The goal is for your team (of 10 or fewer members) to read
a total of 100 books.  As of <time datetime="2025-07-28" title="2025-07-28">today</time> we are at 81.  And what we’re reading
launches our interests towards other.</p>
<p>On a lark I checked out <cite data-id="1f28328c-be96-453d-a9a8-9b921c39fd8a">The Little Book of Solitude</cite> by Joost Joossen; and read an micro-essay about Pico
Iyer.  Curious, I looked up his bibliography, and found <cite data-id="fee4ffa7-1d45-46e7-86f1-af203b92f54b">Aflame</cite> by Pico Iyer.</p>
<p>Which, <time datetime="2025-07-28" title="2025-07-28">this morning</time> I sent an email sharing a conflation of memories, dreams,
and readings with Sekar, the author of <a href="https://sekarwrites.com/the-emotional-cost-of-being-a-reader/">The Emotional Cost of Being a Reader</a>.  I
encountered something deep and reflective in <cite data-id="fee4ffa7-1d45-46e7-86f1-af203b92f54b">Aflame</cite>.</p>
<p>Iyer’s <cite data-id="fee4ffa7-1d45-46e7-86f1-af203b92f54b">Aflame</cite> dances through decades, a fire burning, fueled by solitude that
brings about a deeper connection to the world around.  I scribbled notes in the margins and captured several quotes for reflection.</p>
<p>This is a book in which fire flickers, looms, and erupts; pulling upon my
memories of nights around a campfire, in which infinity feels within reach.  Of
flames twisting, flickering, and revealing.  And of <cite data-id="7904CE86-1A82-4FCB-B0DB-BCBCE04C2811">The Origins of Creativity</cite> by Edward O. Wilson, and his research of the types of conversations our
ancestors of millennia ago likely had around the fire…these were the stories
that shaped identity, memory, and purpose.</p>
<p>I also think of camp, when someone’s marshmallow caught on fire, and to
extinguish they attempted to fan it out by flapping the stick back and forth.
Then watching in horror as that flaming marshmallow launched and hit someone in
the face…a rudimentary napalm.</p>
<p><i class="new-thought">I find</i>myself fascinated with language and philosophy, often placing
the spiritual alongside philosophy.  Which writing that conjures an oft heard Bible verse: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
was God.”</p>
<p>These days, I’m casting a broad net for wisdom and finding meaning.  Finding
profundity in paradox and poetry; in koans and aphorisms.  New, old, and
ancient.  From my immediate tradition (of Russian Mennonite) I never found nor
heard calls for proselytizing; and consider suspect any of those calls to be
dubious, arrogant, and dismissive.</p>
<p>I look to each book as a dawn breaking, bringing color anew; as waves lapping on
the lake, an infinity of truth ever arriving; an evening fire around which I
hear our stories old (and new).</p>
