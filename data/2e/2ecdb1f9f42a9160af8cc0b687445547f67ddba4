Apple is offering a limited-time promotion for its streaming service, giving new and eligible returning subscribers access to Apple TV+ for just &#36;2.99 per month for three months.<br/>

The deal runs until April 24, 2025, and offers a decent discount from the regular &#36;9.99 monthly subscription price, saving viewers &#36;21 over the promotional period.<br/>
<br/>
The offer comes as Apple TV+ has been boosted in popularity with hit shows like "Severance," which recently surpassed "Ted Lasso" as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/severance-more-popular-than-ted-lasso/">platform's most-watched series</a>. Seth Rogen's "The Studio" has also been receiving positive reviews from critics and viewers.<br/>
<br/>
The streaming service also includes sports content with "Friday Night Baseball" and select Major League Soccer matches from MLS Season Pass.<br/>
<br/>
After the three-month promotional period ends, subscriptions will automatically renew at the standard &#36;9.99 monthly rate unless canceled. The deal excludes Apple device customers who are already eligible for a free three-month trial and subscribers who get Apple TV+ through third-party providers or mobile wireless carriers.<br/>
