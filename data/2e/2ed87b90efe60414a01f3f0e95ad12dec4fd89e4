</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cozy-caravan/id6740474743" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cozy Caravan</a>: another family-friendly game where kids can create and play as an animal character, make meals, and enjoy activities like fishing and games, all while preparing for the Whizz Bang Fair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/potion-punch-2/id6636548835" rel="noopener noreferrer">Potion Punch 2+</a>: a restaurant management simulator where you manage a variety of shops like the Potion Café or Enchantment Shop. The app features a fantasy theme filled with magic and monsters with an amusing storyline.</p>

<p id="p11">I loved season one of this series starring Idris Elba, who returns as corporate negotiator Sam Nelson in this real-time thriller. After saving a hijacked flight last season, Sam finds himself at the center of a new crisis on a Berlin underground train. The eight-episode season includes new cast members Toby Jones, Lisa Vicari, and Clare-Hope Ashitey, with returning stars Christine Adams, Max Beesley, and Archie Panjabi.</p>
