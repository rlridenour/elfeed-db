Apple has completed Engineering Validation Testing (EVT) for at least one iPhone 17 model, according to a <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/backgrounders/features/snapshots.asp#s2">paywalled preview of an upcoming <em>DigiTimes</em> report</a>.<br/>

The EVT stage involves Apple testing iPhone 17 prototypes to ensure the hardware works as expected. There are still DVT (Design Validation Test) and PVT (Production Validation Test) stages to follow before the devices enter mass production.<br/>
<br/>
This is a routine but key milestone for Apple to have achieved ahead of the iPhone 17 series launching in the usual month of September.<br/>
<br/>
Following the EVT stage, there is still a window for Apple to make some smaller iPhone spec changes, if necessary. For example, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently claimed that Apple would make a final decision on whether to include 8GB or 12GB of RAM in the iPhone 17 base model by May. At a minimum, Kuo expects the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-12gb-ram-rumor/">to be equipped with 12GB of RAM</a>.<br/>
