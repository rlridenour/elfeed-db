<p>Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged urgent action after groups of Israeli settlers set fire to Palestinian homes and vehicles in West Bank villages, and Israeli forces dismantled an illegal outpost near Gush Etzion on Monday, citing severe violence and clashes with security troops. Netanyahu called the perpetrators a &quot;handful of extremists&quot; and said he would convene ministers and ask law enforcement to act &#x27;to the fullest extent of the law&#x27; as his government seeks to restore order amid rising international pressure. The incidents form part of a wider spike in violence across the occupied West Bank since the October 2023 Gaza war, complicating security and humanitarian conditions for Palestinian communities.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ZtQ5rBMfhv4ylWI_W__gxdY4ifuFHD7SyXsrHaLn21m5PxIrKzK4hmZpgSUxbHaLxvfYLwlTfTQhVOudb_ErzkLVb4NyNo-KlF_s0S8yPUZ0N2R0bScVrjX0HzoBdZX9uTnhGu9laV7xNZ-DU-E-uxhxHnsPP6FYTSP6mj4pbKMo1TFWhjRA824QN5CQL5QbhCYoSHUkOcA-VHu-1xMQeUuRASMKQj6JOJA6ydYwfl-9SwzaFmZCeXQy2q5D_FNYF6oWQJn_kKy-WeZb4liJ' alt='Palestinian farmland and olive trees affected by recent settler harassment during harvest season' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>UN reporting: The United Nations logged a record 260 attacks in the West Bank in October, its highest monthly tally on record, highlighting an intensification of settler-related incidents.</li><li>Emergency access blocked: Israeli forces reportedly blocked fire engines and ambulances from reaching one attack scene while outpost dismantling operations were under way, according to local reports and footage.</li><li>Political pressure: Facing criticism at home and abroad, Netanyahu&#x27;s government has pledged extra funding and resources to address settler violence while also containing coalition tensions with settler-aligned partners.</li><li>Security response: The Israeli military and police are searching for suspects and said they were investigating the arson incidents after videos and reports circulated of attackers and property damage.</li></ul><blockquote>I call on the law enforcement authorities to deal with the rioters to the fullest extent of the law - Benjamin Netanyahu</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Benjamin Netanyahu / Israeli government: Netanyahu said the perpetrators are &#x27;a group that does not represent&#x27; settlers and vowed to convene ministers and press law enforcement to act firmly, calling them &#x27;extremists&#x27;.
