Last week, it emerged that Chinese display manufacturer BOE was aggressively <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/chinas-boe-planning-100m-iphone-comeback/">ramping up its OLED production capacity</a> for future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models as part of a plan to recapture a major role in Apple's supply chain.<br/>
<br/>
Now, tech news aggregator <a href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1943096720893841688">Jukan Choi</a> reports that Apple has approved BOE's latest displays for mass production. However, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models with BOE displays will apparently be limited to the Chinese market. <br/>
<br/>
Today, Apple sources the majority of its OLED panels for iPhones from South Korea-based Samsung Display and LG Display. BOE has struggled to replicate the panel brightness, efficiency, and long-term durability of Samsung and LG's offerings.<br/>
<br/>
In May 2022, Apple halted BOE's inclusion in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13's supply chain after detecting unauthorized design modifications. The crisis began when BOE, facing component shortages and yield issues, expanded the circuit width of thin-film transistors in its panels without Apple's approval. When Apple discovered this, Apple instructed BOE to halt production.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, BOE has gradually sought to return to Apple's good graces. The company was later granted approval to resume supplying OLED panels for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14, albeit in limited quantities. The Chinese supplier apparently intends to play a major role in &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; production in the future and grow its share of Apple's highly competitive display supply chain.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/boe/">BOE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jukanlosreve/">Jukanlosreve</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/11/iphone-17-pros-with-boe-displays-for-china-only/">iPhone 17 Pro Models With BOE Displays Will Be Sold in China Only</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-models-with-boe-displays-will-be-sold-in-china-only.2461353/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
