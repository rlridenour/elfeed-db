One of the key changes to Safari on iOS 26 is a redesigned Liquid Glass address bar, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-ios-26-safari-design/">three layouts available</a> to choose from. Beyond that, the upcoming software update includes a few smaller changes for the web browser.<br/>

<h2>Web Apps For All Websites</h2><br/>
Starting with iOS 26, every website added to the Home Screen via Safari opens as a web app, even if it is not configured to be. On earlier iOS versions, websites that were not configured to open as a web app would open in Safari, meaning that the Home Screen app icons for those websites were effectively just bookmarks.<br/>

Users can turn off "Open as Web App" while adding a website to the Home Screen if they prefer the app icons to still function as simple bookmarks.<br/>
<br/>
This change also applies to iPadOS 26.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>HDR Images</h2><br/>
Safari now supports HDR images, five years after the browser gained support for HDR video.<br/>
<br/>
HDR images have wider dynamic range and increased color gamut, making bright areas of the image appear brighter and dark areas appear darker.<br/>
<br/>
This change applies across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>SVG Icons</h2><br/>
Safari now supports the SVG file format for icons anywhere that they are shown in the browser, including in the bookmark bar and on the start page.<br/>
<br/>
SVG icons have smaller file sizes than PNG icons, and they offer infinite vector scaling, meaning they can be resized without any loss in image quality.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More</h2><br/>
Even more changes coming to Safari across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26 were outlined in a <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/16993/news-from-wwdc25-web-technology-coming-this-fall-in-safari-26-beta/">WebKit blog post</a> last week.<br/>
