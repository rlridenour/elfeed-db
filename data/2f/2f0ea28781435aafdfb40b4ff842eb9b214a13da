<p>Among many other things, Emacs’ Org mode manages tasks and allows you
to easily see an agenda of tasks that are scheduled or approaching a
deadline. Emacs also has an appointments system that shows scheduled
appointments at various times ahead of time. Org provides
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-agenda-to-appt</code> to create appointments from your
agenda items.</p>

<p>So running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-agenda-to-appt</code> once during Emacs
startup is great, but it has limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it only creates appointments from today’s agenda items</li>
  <li>it has no clue when you’ve added an appointment to one of your
agenda files</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming you run your Emacs for longer than a day, or that you add
appointments, this is a problem!</p>

<p>My solution is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-agenda-to-appt</code> with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run-at-time</code> with a repeater of 3600 seconds, i.e. 1
hour, like this, at Emacs start:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">run-at-time</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="mi">3600</span> <span class="ss">'org-agenda-to-appt</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Time 0 means “right now”, and the repeater is 3600 seconds. After
adding a new task to an agenda file, it shows up as an appointment
within an hour. This may not work if you add an appointment that’s due
in the next hour, as the timer that adds the apointment may run after
the appointment time.</p>
