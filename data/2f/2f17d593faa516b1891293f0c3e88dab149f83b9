Even though the iPhone 17 Pro models can briefly reach a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/iphone-17-pro-max-usb-c-charging-speed-test/">higher 36W peak</a> USB-C charging speed, Apple says all of the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro models can be charged up to 50% in 20 minutes with a compatible charger, including its new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/apple-40w-to-60w-charger-key-advantage/">40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max</a>. For comparison, the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max can be charged up to 50% in 30 minutes with a compatible charger.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGKN4AM/A/40w-dynamic-power-adapter-with-60w-max">available to order</a> in the U.S., Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, Taiwan, and the Philippines.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind you also need an appropriate USB-C cable for fast-charging capabilities, with the most basic or cheap options sometimes not supporting enough power delivery. If you are unsure, the USB-C cable included in the box with iPhones does the trick.<br/>
<br/>
As for wireless MagSafe charging, the standard iPhone 17 reached a peak charging speed of 29W with Apple's latest MagSafe Charger, according to ChargerLAB. For sustained MagSafe charging, Apple says the device can reach up to 25W speeds.<br/>
