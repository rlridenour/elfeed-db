<p>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to Microsoft for 50 years of being awesome to developers!
Some years the software was great. Some years the software sucked.
Every year the company and its ecosystem has stood with and
supported developers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I pity the man who doesn’t have enough fingers to count the number of game stores available on Xbox.</p>
