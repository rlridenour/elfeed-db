<li>An interesting discourse on Light and Dark mode. I use <a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/" target="_blank">Solarized</a>, Light during the day and Dark at night. <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Dark-Mode-iPhone-Android-interface-feature-pros-cons-versus-light-mode_id116978" target="_blank">The pros and cons of Dark Mode Here’s when to use it and why - PhoneArena</a></li>
<li>After all of these years using macOS, I discover new things. This article is illuminating the uses of the Option key. <a href="https://getenet.notion.site/Eighty-Shades-of-Option-Key-3c6e58feb5c848ee9d4c027f0b9d52e0" target="_blank">Eighty Shades of Option Key</a></li>
<li>This was useful from Jack Baty. - <a href="https://baty.net/2023/prepending-creation-date-to-selected-files" target="_blank">Prepending creation date to selected files using AppleScript (macOS) - ~Baty.net</a></li>
<li>These two articles hit home with me. <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/i-tried-to-migrate-to-todoist-it-didnt-go-well/" target="_blank">I Tried to Migrate to Todoist; It Didn’t Go Well – The Sweet Setup</a> and <a href="https://www.gr36.com/2023/04/27/not-chasing-perfection.html" target="_blank">Greg Morris - Not Chasing Perfection</a>. I spent a lot of time looking for the right program to write in. Every solution I landed on had some good features and some not so good ones. Every product had friction points. I solved my quest by settling on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a>. It is not perfect, but it is where I spend all my time. It doesn’t grate on me. It has no deal breaking friction point. I discovered that the more time you spent in an application, the more you learn about it. That learning makes you efficient in the application and you feel better using it. I wish I had discovered this truth earlier.</li>
