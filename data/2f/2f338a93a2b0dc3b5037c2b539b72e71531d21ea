<p>Cynthia Knight composed this in 1983 &#8212; a poem typed entirely on the upper row of a typewriter:</p>
<p>O WOE<br />
(we quote you, poor poet)<br />
We tiptoe up, quiet. You peer out. You opt to write<br />
quite proper poetry<br />
to pour out your pretty repertoire.<br />
We try to woo you to write. You pop out; retire to pout.<br />
Torpor? Terror? Ire? Or worry? We pity you, poor poet.<br />
Put out, you rip your poetry up. Too trite?<br />
We try to pique you.<br />
Were your pep to tire, or your power to rot<br />
We prop you up to retype it.<br />
Or were our top priority to trip you<br />
or were etiquette, piety, or propriety to require you to wire up your typewriter to rewrite it &#8230;<br />
O! You write witty quip, pert retort. You titter. You write pure, utter tripe too, I purr.<br />
You err<br />
retype your error<br />
weep<br />
wipe your wet typewriter (your property)<br />
We TOWER o&#8217;er you, wee tot &#8212; were you TWO?<br />
YOU WORE YOUR TOY TYPEWRITER OUT!<br />
We quit.</p>
