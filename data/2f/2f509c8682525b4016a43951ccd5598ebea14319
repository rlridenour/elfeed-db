About a year ago I was bitten by the PL bug. It started with reading Crafting Interpreters and discovering the wonders hidden under the hood of a compiler. I am also been a big fan of Emacs, and this started to get me interested in how its interpreter works. At the same time, I was reading the Rust book and trying to understand the concepts there. This all came to a head, and I decided to write an Emacs Lisp interpreter called rune in Rust.
