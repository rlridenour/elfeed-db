<li>It’ll charge your EV if it has an NACS port (or you can use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Adapter-J1772-Adaptive-Charging/dp/B0CW1JC9HD/?tag=meh0ec-20">this $28 J1772 adapter</a>)</li>
<li>That means it works with Teslas, but also other cars</li>
<li>Looks very cool</li>
<li>Is it Mac-compatible: Hmmm… will Apple ever make an EV?</li>
</ul><h1>Make It Go</h1><p>Today, we’re selling a charger designed for cars made by Tesla. You know, the totally non-controversial automotive company run by geniuses.</p>
<p>And what perfect timing, right? After all, everyone’s talking about Tesla right now! Why, just Google “Tesla” and dozens of articles from the past week alone pop up. (We actually didn’t click on any, but we assume it’s all good news about how cool the cars are and stuff.)</p>
<p>But hold on, which Teslas does this thing charge? According to this image, most of them (or at least the current ones):</p>

<p>That’s right, whether you drive their cars, SUVs, or the truck-thing that looks it was created with the original <em>Unreal</em> engine, you’re covered!</p>
<p>Okay, we got our digs in. But real talk? Cars are major investments. So if you own a Tesla, you’ll probably keep driving it for a while — which means you’ll need to keep it charged. After all, switching something like a soda brand is easy, but selling a car, taking a financial loss, and going through the process of buying a new one? That’s a much bigger decision, no matter the circumstances.</p>
<p>Plus, this thing can charge cars other than Teslas if your car is still rockin’ a J1772 port – just buy one of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Adapter-J1772-Adaptive-Charging/dp/B0CW1JC9HD/?tag=meh0ec-20">these $28 adapters</a>.  Moving forward, most EVs will have either a NACS port or can be adapted to fit one</p>
<p>Which is made clear by <a href="https://d2b8wt72ktn9a2.cloudfront.net/mediocre/image/upload/v1746025996/fjzwmojj5o0sfhlpatxd.pdf">this PDF</a>.</p>
<p><em>Deep sigh</em>. Yes, we asked ChatGPT to help us make that because no one here really understands what any of this shit means. Oddly enough, “Automotive Innovations” was not a class I had to take to earn my MFA in creative writing.</p>
<p>But, you know, the usual disclaimer: AI makes stuff up all the time. So after you check out that PDF, check the <a href="https://meh.com/daily/forum">forum</a> to see what it got wrong.</p>
<p>In conclusion, you might want to buy this charger.</p>
