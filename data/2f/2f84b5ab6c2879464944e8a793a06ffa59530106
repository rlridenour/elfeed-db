<p>I finally got around to reading&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/use-cases/student-writing-guide/">ChatGPT’s Student Guide to Writing with ChatGPT</a>, and I think it’s pretty good. The reality is that these tools aren’t going away, and students today should learn how to use them to improve their work product, not replace it.</p>



<p>The guide offers a solid list of ideas — none of which include the prompt,&nbsp;<em>“Please write this for me.”</em>&nbsp;Instead, it emphasizes using AI as a tool to refine thinking, generate ideas, and improve clarity. That’s exactly how I use AI in my own writing.</p>



<p>For example, I’ve been experimenting with having AI read my draft blog posts and ask me clarifying questions. More often than not, those questions push me to refine my ideas and make the post better. The AI isn’t writing for me; it’s helping me sharpen my own words.</p>



<p>For students (and writers in general), the key is understanding that AI is most useful as a creative assistant, not a shortcut. The better your input, the better your output.</p>



<p>If you’re curious about using AI in your writing, I’d recommend&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/use-cases/student-writing-guide/">checking out the guide</a>.</p>
