<p>Yesterday we finished watching season two of Severance, and it got me so <em>angry</em>. I was fuming. I had to go for a walk and leave poor Nat with the takeout containers to clean (I did apologize and say he can just put it in a bag, but the shock I gave him was a different story)</p>
<p>Why was I so angry? To explain that I need to explain more than a decade of my lifestyle and the impact it had on my life in light of what is considered to be normal or usual, which is what I suspect the show&rsquo;s target audience is.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the show itself is great, the story is good, and my anger wasn&rsquo;t really directed at the story or the characters in it; it was mostly directed at its creators and the mindset. And from there it escalated to the whole &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with the world,&rdquo; and me barking at clouds again.</p>
<p>The good thing that came out of it, besides the nice walk, was to start a new lifestyle category on my blog and see how it goes. The trick is to know what <em>not</em> to include under &ldquo;lifestyle,&rdquo; because I have a tendency to use &ldquo;life&rdquo; as an overall category for everything that doesn&rsquo;t fit anywhere else.</p>
<p>So while I&rsquo;m not 100% sure what it will be yet, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://taonaw.com/categories/lifestyle/">there</a>, with its own dedicated <a href="https://taonaw.com/categories/lifestyle/feed.xml">RSS feed</a> and all (I need to explain the feeds of my blogs a bit better for you RSS folks out there).</p>
