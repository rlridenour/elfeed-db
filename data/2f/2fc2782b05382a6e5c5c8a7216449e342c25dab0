<p id="p2">Last year, Apple announced a partnership with cable company Spectrum and the Los Angeles Lakers to stream select games in Apple Immersive Video on Vision Pro. Today, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/spectrum-front-row-tips-off-january-9-on-apple-vision-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the company announced the schedule</a> and availability of the games, which will be offered via Spectrum Front Row starting this Friday.</p>
<p id="p3">These are the dates the games will be streamed live in Immersive Video:</p>
<ul id="ul4"><li>Friday, January 9, at 7:30 p.m PT</li>
<li>Thursday, February 5, at 7:00 p.m. PT</li>
<li>Friday, February 20, at 7:00 p.m. PT</li>
<li>Thursday, March 5, at 7:00 p.m. PT</li>
<li>Tuesday, March 10, at 8:00 p.m. PT</li>
<li>Monday, March 30, at 7:00 p.m. PT</li>
</ul><p id="p5">In the press release, Apple revealed details of what viewers can expect from the broadcasts:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote6"><p>
  Spectrum Front Row in Apple Immersive is directed and produced for Vision Pro with a feed of up to 150 Mbps and seven unique viewing angles: the scorer’s table, the area beneath each basket, a high-and-wide view of the arena, the player tunnel, the broadcast booth, and a roaming courtside perspective for interviews and commentary. The broadcast team features Emmy Award-winning play-by-play commentator Mark Rogondino and three-time NBA champion and former Lakers forward Danny Green as an analyst.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p7">Spectrum SportsNet subscribers in the Lakers regional broadcast territory (Southern California, Hawaii, and parts of southern Nevada) can watch immersive games live via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spectrum-sportsnet-live-games/id563316826?platform=vision" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Spectrum SportsNet app</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nba-live-games-scores/id484672289?platform=vision" rel="noopener noreferrer">the NBA app</a>. Viewers in other U.S. markets will have access to highlights and full-game replays later, beginning this Sunday, for free via the NBA app or in the SportsNet app with a subscription.</p>
<p id="p8">The games will be available in some international markets as well. Users in Japan, Singapore, and South Korea will have access to live immersive games in the NBA app, while users in Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the UAE, and the UK will be able to watch replays up to 24 hours after each game has ended.</p>
<p id="p9">The Vision Pro’s potential for offering viewers the thrill of attending sports events has been a part of the product’s story from the very beginning, with the company including sports footage in the first demos shown to attendees at WWDC 2023. And while we’ve seen highlight videos of various sporting events released publicly since then, this collaboration marks the first time Vision Pro users will be able to experience a full game in Immersive Video. This is also the first time the format will be used for live video rather than on-demand. It’s only a handful of games from one team, but this is a step forward for Immersive Video and the Vision Pro itself that I’m looking forward to experiencing myself this weekend.</p>
