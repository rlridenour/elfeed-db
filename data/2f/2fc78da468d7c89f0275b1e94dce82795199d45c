<p>It touches on several aspects of the problem of student use of ChatGPT and other AIs in their coursework, including its prevalence, the underestimation of the phenomenon by faculty, the growing acceptance of its use (see <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/23/ai-firm-start-cheating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cluely</a>), and the possible consequences of all of this. For some, it will be an eye-opener. If you&#8217;ve been reading the posts here about AI over the past five years I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be too surprised.</p>
<p>That said, there are some noteworthy passages. Here&#8217;s one that illustrates what students are doing with AI and how they don&#8217;t quite understand what it is they&#8217;re doing&#8212;including what they&#8217;re doing to themselves.</p>

<p><em>Wendy, a freshman finance major at one of the city’s top universities, told me that she is against using AI. Or, she clarified, “I’m against copy-and-pasting. I’m against cheating and plagiarism. All of that. It’s against the student handbook.” Then she described, step-by-step, how on a recent Friday at 8 a.m., she called up an AI platform to help her write a four-to-five-page essay due two hours later.</em></p>
<p><em>Whenever Wendy uses AI to write an essay (which is to say, whenever she writes an essay), she follows three steps. Step one: “I say, ‘I’m a first-year college student. I’m taking this English class.’” Otherwise, Wendy said, “it will give you a very advanced, very complicated writing style, and you don’t want that.” Step two: Wendy provides some background on the class she’s taking before copy-and-pasting her professor’s instructions into the chatbot. Step three: “Then I ask, ‘According to the prompt, can you please provide me an outline or an organization to give me a structure so that I can follow and write my essay?’ It then gives me an outline, introduction, topic sentences, paragraph one, paragraph two, paragraph three.” Sometimes, Wendy asks for a bullet list of ideas to support or refute a given argument: “I have difficulty with organization, and this makes it really easy for me to follow.”</em></p>
<p><em>Once the chatbot had outlined Wendy’s essay, providing her with a list of topic sentences and bullet points of ideas, all she had to do was fill it in. Wendy delivered a tidy five-page paper at an acceptably tardy 10:17 a.m. When I asked her how she did on the assignment, she said she got a good grade. “I really like writing,” she said, sounding strangely nostalgic for her high-school English class — the last time she wrote an essay unassisted. “Honestly,” she continued, “I think there is beauty in trying to plan your essay. You learn a lot. You have to think, Oh, what can I write in this paragraph? Or What should my thesis be?</em><em> </em><em>” But she</em><em>’d rather get good grades. </em><em>“An essay with ChatGPT, it</em><em>’s like it just gives you straight up what you have to follow. You just don</em><em>’t really have to think that much.</em><em>”</em></p>
<p><em>I asked Wendy if I could read the paper she turned in, and when I opened the document, I was surprised to see the topic: critical pedagogy, the philosophy of education pioneered by Paulo Freire. The philosophy examines the influence of social and political forces on learning and classroom dynamics. Her opening line: “To what extent is schooling hindering students’ cognitive ability to think critically?” Later, I asked Wendy if she recognized the irony in using AI to write not just a paper on critical pedagogy but one that argues learning is what “makes us truly human.” She wasn’t sure what to make of the question. “I use AI a lot. Like, every day,” she said. “And I do believe it could take away that critical-thinking part. But it’s just — now that we rely on it, we can’t really imagine living without it.”</em></p>
