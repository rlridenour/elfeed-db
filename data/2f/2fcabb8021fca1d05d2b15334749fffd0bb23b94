<p>Airbnb CEO (and founder) Brian Chesky, back in October in an interview with Nilay Patel, regarding Tim Cook’s eventual successor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This goes to the very awkward thing that no one wants to talk
about. Succession planning is hard because the people that are
great product visionaries are typically young. They’re young and
they’re less mature. Who wants to put a young, not-super-mature
person at the helm of a giant company? Founders are allowed to
manage people older than them because they’re the founders. If
you’re not the founder, people just don’t want to be managed by
somebody younger than them who’s maybe a virtuoso, a wunderkind,
but they’re a little immature. The companies don’t want to take
that risk, so they bias towards senior, grown-up, functional
experts. But typically that function is not the product, and I
think that’s a problem.</p>

<p>Satya [Nadella, Microsoft CEO] is more technical. I think that
has afforded them more, but he mostly just got them back to Bill
Gates’ primacy. I think Apple should go back to having a CEO
that’s the chief product officer. I think it should rein the
company in and simplify how it operates, but that’s just my
opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a very succinct summation of the problem Apple faces replacing Tim Cook, and it’s a much better explanation, or angle, on “<a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/foundermode.html">Founder Mode</a>” than just about any I’ve seen. It’s not that founders are magic. It’s that youth is magic. And the only effective way to get a big company led by a young CEO is for that CEO to be a founder. </p>

<p>Or even a returning founder — Steve Jobs was 42 when he returned to Apple after his decade-ish exile in 1997. But that leads to what’s probably an additional thing working against youthful leaders at Apple, which might be a belief, probably largely unspoken, that the only people who really “get it” are the people who were there with Jobs, especially those who worked for him directly.</p>

<p>But Sundar Pichai was only 43 when he became CEO of Google. Google’s always been different, and maybe that’s one of the ways they’ve been <em>successfully</em> different.</p>
