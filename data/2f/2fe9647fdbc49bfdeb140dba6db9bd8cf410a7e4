Some of the features available through the Apple Watch app include Lock/Unlock, Honk and Flash, Vehicle Status, and Lock Status. For EVs, Remote Charging, Charge Status, and Climate Start/Stop are available. ICE models have access to Remote Start/Stop and Fuel Status.<br/>

To use the app, vehicle owners will need to download the myWV app, accept the myVW terms of service, add their vehicle to the virtual garage, and subscribe to a paid or included Remote Access or VW Vehicle Insights plan.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/13/myvw-apple-watch-app/">Volkswagen&#039;s myVW App Now Available on Apple Watch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/volkswagens-myvw-app-now-available-on-apple-watch.2471102/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
