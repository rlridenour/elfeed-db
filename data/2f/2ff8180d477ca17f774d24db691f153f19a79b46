<p>There&#8217;s a lot of chatter lately about Apple working on a new entry-level MacBook. The latest <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250811PD214/apple-low-cost-macbook-notebook-market.html?mod=3&amp;q=entry%2Dlevel+macbook">report from DigiTimes</a> claims it could feature a 12.9-inch display and, more importantly, a $599 price tag. That&#8217;s right, six hundred bucks for a MacBook.</p>



<p>If true, this could mark the return of the plain old &#8220;MacBook&#8221; branding. Apple retired that line back in 2019, but it has always carried a certain charm. The old 12-inch MacBook was ahead of its time and had the right ideas: ultra-portable, fanless, and light. It was, however, during the Intel era and it was also underpowered, got too hot, and was overpriced. A modern spin with Apple Silicon under the hood could be the redemption story for the name.</p>



<p>The real story here is the price. At $599, this would dramatically undercut the current MacBook Air, which starts at $999. It would also make Apple competitive with Chromebooks, low-end PCs, and even iPads with keyboards. This isn&#8217;t just another MacBook, it’s the&nbsp;<em>gateway Mac</em>&nbsp;for first-time buyers, students, and maybe even Windows switchers who&#8217;ve hesitated at the $1,000+ threshold.</p>



<p>Think of it as a Mac mini with a screen.</p>



<p>Of course, to get down to $599, something has to give. The screen would be a little smaller than the Air&#8217;s, and the processor could be a repurposed A18 mobile chip rather than an M-series. RAM will almost certainly be at the bare minimum. Storage could start at 128 GB. And don&#8217;t expect a rainbow of color options; Apple will likely keep this simple to keep costs down.</p>



<p>A $599 MacBook will eat some into Air sales, but Apple may not care if the net effect is pulling in more users. It could also make some would-be iPad + keyboard buyers think twice. For years, the Air has been the entry-level Mac. If this rumor pans out, the Air suddenly has company on the lower shelf.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve long wished Apple would bring back the ultralight 12-inch MacBook. I don&#8217;t think this is that machine. This one feels like it&#8217;s going to be all about minimal specs at a low price point. But Apple Silicon is&nbsp;<em>that good</em>. Even a &#8220;budget&#8221; version will likely feel fast and capable for most people. If Apple really does launch a $599 MacBook, I expect they’ll sell a lot of them and their owners will be happy.</p>
