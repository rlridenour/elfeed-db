Apple's "A20" chip designed for next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models could be considerably more expensive, the <a href="https://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20250922000510-260110?chdtv"><em>China Times</em></a> reports.<br/>

The A20 chip is likely to be the first widely available 2-nanometer chip, debuting in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> lineup next year and forming the foundation of subsequent M6-series chips. The previous three generation A-series chips have all been based on TMSC's 3-nanometer node, with the upgrade to 2-nanometer promising further performance and efficiency improvements.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC has reportedly told customers, presumably including Apple, to expect pricing that is at least 50% higher than 3-nanometer processors. This is attributed to unusually high capital expenditure for the new node and to the lack of discounting strategies while yields are still in their early acceptable phase.<br/>
<br/>
The report further states that suppliers expect flagship mobile chips built on the 2-nanometer process to carry unit prices around &#36;280 once volume production begins. This would make it the most expensive component in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and dramatically affect Apple's profit margins, if the increase is not passed on to customers.<br/>
<br/>
A report from <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241004PD214/apple-iphone-component-cost-production-profit.html">DigiTimes</a></em> last year placed the cost of the A18 chip at around &#36;45, with a total hardware bill of &#36;416 for a model that retailed at &#36;799, implying that the chip represents roughly 10% of bill of materials (BOM) cost and about 5–6% of retail price before logistics and development expenses. The most expensive component in that teardown was the rear camera assembly rather than the chip.<br/>
<br/>
If the component cost rumors are true, Apple could limit 2-nanometer chips to only some 2026 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, such as the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max. In September last year, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1836674446763208925">warned</a> that "due to cost concerns, not all new &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; models may be equipped with a 2-nanometer processor."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2nm/">2nm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chinatimes/">China Times</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/apples-a20-chip-could-be-massively-more-expensive/">Apple&#039;s A20 Chip Could Be Massively More Expensive</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-a20-chip-could-be-massively-more-expensive.2469600/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
