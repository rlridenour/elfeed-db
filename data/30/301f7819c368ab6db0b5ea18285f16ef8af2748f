</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
On being human, embracing the analogue, and working through private deep introspection.
</p>
        <p>From <a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/being-creative-requires-taking-risks">Being creative requires taking risks</a>:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

Children will say stuff that will shock you, because you can see where they are
coming from, but it’s just not the thing you say. They’re not yet collapsed. But
we are collapsed. We end up revisiting the same thoughts. We end up saying more
and more of the same stuff, and the learning rates go down.

</blockquote>

<p>This requires further thinking and discussion.  Why?  These last few days I’ve
been actively and assertively deconstructing and mitigating deeply internalized
patriarchy—staring at a 50th birthday a half-a-year away; feeling the
reverberations of pivoting from ever darkening days to those of light’s return.</p>
<p>I’m also reading further in the blog post, and fucking hate the permeation of
semantics describing <span>Large Language Model</span> (<abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Large Language Model”" title="Other site-wide references of “Large Language Model”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-LLM">&#128214;</a></small>)
 phenominon that are then projected onto the act of
being human; I’m not a fucking computer nor mathematical model.</p>
<p>I am a human being, always arriving into a present in which I seek orientation,
wonder, beauty, poetry, and art.</p>
<p>A present in which I’m busy practicing to write better haiku, <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>

, love
notes to my wife, and read chunky books.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last 9 days, I have watched only a fragment of something
on “television.”  Most everything else I’ve pursued is tactile: a book printed
on paper, dishes in the sink (so many), colored pencils scribbling on paper, and
more.  (I have had days of work in which I needed to clicky-clacky on the
keyboard to make the code behave).</p>
<p>So, when I read a post in which “the human” condition is mapped to the language
of <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr>
, I think “bro, get out, touch some dirt, read an older book of fiction,
and watch a sunrise.”  We are each, and all, more than that lingual effort to
collapse us into an ever simplifying model.</p>

Warmth of mid-winter<br />
I fear you most as herald<br />
Of hell-blasted hate.<br />
