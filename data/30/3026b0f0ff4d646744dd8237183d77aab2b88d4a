<p>The world’s 100 largest arms and military services companies generated a record $679 billion in sales in 2024, an annual increase of 5.9 percent, according to new data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Researchers link the growth mainly to high demand driven by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and broader geopolitical tensions, which have prompted governments, especially in Europe and the Middle East, to place more and larger orders for weapons and ammunition. Despite the revenue surge, SIPRI notes that actual deliveries have struggled to keep pace with orders because of production bottlenecks, labour shortages and supply‑chain constraints, leaving some armed forces waiting longer for equipment. The report also finds that arms revenues have risen about 26 percent since 2015, underlining how prolonged instability has reshaped the global defense market over the past decade.</p><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Regional growth: European and particularly German arms manufacturers recorded some of the fastest sales growth last year as governments accelerated rearmament in response to Russia’s full‑scale invasion of Ukraine.</li><li>Middle East producers: Nine arms companies based in the Middle East together booked around $31 billion in sales, with three Israeli firms accounting for roughly half of that amount as regional demand rose during the Gaza war.</li><li>US and SpaceX role: US firms remained the dominant players in the rankings, and the SIPRI list now also counts space and missile‑launch activities such as those of Elon Musk’s SpaceX when they are tied directly to military contracts.</li><li>Output constraints: Even as order books expand, some manufacturers face limits from outdated production lines, shortages of skilled workers and delayed component deliveries, slowing efforts to replenish ammunition and missile stocks.</li><li>Longer conflict planning: SIPRI researchers say the spending patterns indicate many governments are planning for the possibility of prolonged or repeated conflicts rather than short, one‑off surges in demand.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>SIPRI researchers: The institute characterizes the revenue jump as a consequence of governments reacting to active wars and heightened security fears, rather than a one‑time statistical anomaly, and warns that persistent demand risks entrenching a higher baseline for global military spending.
