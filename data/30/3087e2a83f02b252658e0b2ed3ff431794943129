<p><a href="https://munozphilosophy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Muñoz</a> has some for you at his blog<em>, </em><a href="https://substack.com/@bigifftrue/p-162615965" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Big Iff True</em></a>.</p>
<p>I like the part about &#8220;the telos&#8221;. What should you aim for, he asks, if you want your manuscript to scream &#8220;PUBLISH ME&#8221;?</p>
<p>Here are three things he mentions:</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>A paper whose contribution is immediately obvious</strong></em>
<p><em>&#8230;the really crucial thing is to start your introduction by <strong>framing the question</strong>. Don’t just launch into your thesis, bury us in citations, or bust out your “road map.” First lay down the basic concepts that your reader needs to understand the question at issue, then give them a sense of why it matters, and only then give a peek at your answer, making sure that your point ends up looking new and interesting. An easy way to do this is by explaining the main issue in a way that creates tension, then telling the reader (not laboriously showing!) how you’re going to resolve that tension in a novel way&#8230;</em></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><em><strong>A goldilocks thesis</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>By which I mean: not too epic, not too tiny—just right. You want a claim that’s grand enough to be interesting but not so grand that you lack room for a proper defense. If you’re struggling to publish an ambitious project, the problem might not be quality but quantity: your thesis may be overspilling your paper. (You can’t frame the question right if the question doesn’t fit the frame!) If so, consider some ways of cutting down on grandiosity. Can you split the paper in two? Can you weaken the thesis?&#8230;</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em><strong>The right venue</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Even if your paper is exactly what it’s supposed to be, that doesn’t mean that it will get in wherever. Ask your advisors and savvy friends what journals you should be sending which papers to. Journals differ in their preferred (a) topics, (b) word counts, and (c) level of grandeur.</em></p>
<p>He elaborates on each of these, discusses things to avoid, and walks the reader through the process&#8212;including, importantly, choosing the right idea.</p>
