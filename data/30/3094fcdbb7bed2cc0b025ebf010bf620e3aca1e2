<p>Is there an analog of throwaway culture in the realm of ideas?</p>
<p><a href="https://axdouglas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Douglas</a> (St. Andrews) thinks so. In a <a href="https://axdouglas.substack.com/p/throwaway-culture-in-philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post at his blog/newsletter</a>, he notes the observations of historian <a href="https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/people/professor-peter-burke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Burke</a> (Cambridge) about this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Old editions of encyclopaedias, for instance, are pulped; the paper is rarely recycled, and likewise the knowledge contained. Even digital editions are often deleted to clear storage space or sent to some inaccessible archive. Sometimes newer editions reuse or update older entries, but just as often new entries are written from scratch, with little or no consultation of the past.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>To prove that there is a real loss of knowledge involved in this waste, Burke documented how certain entries shrunk over time—the </em>Encyclopaedia Britannica<em> entries on King Charles I, Charles V, Raphael, Cicero, Goethe, Luther, and Plato, for example, grew much shorter over time, reflecting a declining public interest in Christianity and classical culture. The knowledge contained in the longer entries might end up being as lost as the Serapeum of Alexandria. Unlike any educated Victorian, you might have to look up what that is, but once you do you’ll see the point: public interest is fickle, and a time will likely come when we wish we hadn’t thrown away so much knowledge on then-unfashionable topics.</em></p>
<p>What about in philosophy? Douglas writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>In philosophy, I think our throwaway culture results in a lot of wasted time and effort. Large research grants are awarded to researchers who use </em>a priori<em> methods, or consultation of only the most recent sources, to come the long way around to ideas, arguments, theories, and insights that are abundantly documented and discussed in historical texts. Vast sums are then paid to predatory publishing houses to digitally print these redundant results. It is like watching a government spend billions on new buildings, expanding cities into ecologically fragile hinterlands, while existing buildings in the centre of the city are abandoned to dereliction rather than being restored and updated at a fraction of the cost&#8230;</em></p>
<p>What&#8217;s an example of this phenomenon?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>In the early days of analytic philosophy, a lot of time and effort went into “discovering” the various consequence relations that might hold between propositions besides material implication. A mountain of literature was produced&#8212;shiny new buildings on the edge of town&#8212;while Buridan’s </em>Treatise on Consequences<em> sat unread. Almost nobody thought to check what might be salvageable in this or hundreds of other medieval works on the topic. Since most philosophy degrees tended to divide the history of philosophy into “Ancient” and “Modern”, with the intervening millennium and a half unmentioned, the whole medieval tradition lay as unseen as an underground landfill.</em></p>
<p>I suspect some readers have other examples in mind.</p>
<p>Throwaway culture in philosophy is &#8220;self-defeating,&#8221; Douglas says.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>What does anyone write philosophy for, if not to have it used and developed in the future? What is the point of writing it at all if the cultural norms of academia guarantee that in fifty years time the most anyone will say about your work is the box-ticking footnote, “(Smith 2025) is a pioneering study of the topic”, and in a hundred years time nobody will know it at all? </em></p>
<p>Douglas thinks that the lesson here is that the discipline should &#8220;cultivate a more respectful attitude towards past ideas.&#8221; Though he doesn&#8217;t put it this way, it seems the idea is that the history of philosophy, far from a backwards-looking drag on progress in philosophy, is instead crucial for making sure such progress is not merely apparent.</p>
