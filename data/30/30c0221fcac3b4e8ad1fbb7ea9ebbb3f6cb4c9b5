<p>President Trump, in a post on Truth Social, which is apparently how the world’s financial markets now run:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s
Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the
United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some
point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the
days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer
sustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that
more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United
States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the
USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed
relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation,
and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my
strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against
the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a
substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of
10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to
this matter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/09/trump-announces-90-day-tariff-pause-for-at-least-some-countries.html">The entire stock market jumped</a> on Trump’s announcement, with the S&amp;P 500 up 8% as I type this. Apple is up 9%, Meta 13%, Nvidia 16%, and Tesla 19%. I’m not sure why though. All Trump seems to have done is switch from waging a trade war against the entire world to a trade war against China. And the 10% tariffs Trump now claims we’re applying to imports from the rest of world are themselves economic nonsense — they only look low compared to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-day-two">the nonsensical rates Trump announced a week ago</a>. We’re at the whims of a mad king. Trying to report this as having any sort of logic in a traditional economic sense is folly. It’s like trying to make scientific sense out of the biblical fable of Noah’s Ark.</p>
