<p>Two closely watched US court cases begin this week, and both could help define what responsibility social-media platforms bear for harms to children and teens. In Los Angeles County Superior Court, plaintiffs want a jury to hold Instagram owner Meta and YouTube owner Google liable for allegedly designing products that can be addictive for young users and cause harm. In a separate case in New Mexico, plaintiffs say Meta failed to do enough to keep young users from explicit material and to reduce sexual exploitation risks, putting the company’s child-safety practices under a spotlight. In the California trial, plaintiffs’ lawyers described the platforms as “digital casinos” or “addiction machines,” and pointed jurors to internal studies and documents they say show the companies understood how certain features could keep minors engaged. Meta and Google are expected to push back on key parts of that narrative, including how scientists define and measure “addiction” when it comes to social-media use. Outside the courtroom, several outlets say the cases could shape wider debates about platform accountability and child online safety, especially if they set new legal precedents.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/bfZ3hgBoU_bEEOAEvZgcNcBJCgvqYZg4OgPSfqr7K2VEjdrWX7T92YbuabK2RpgF_eSrDpS2SJ1D5B2kp0F37-v9nXKlfBzEpZ5bsWdfdQTyhnf4g-XnIhb1fop7EClibvTWIcwC_qTx8xRJxoI8lUtxmxD4-EzzbdAl7hhbtlHkBbrFF0iuKCjAF7djTR8b203cQT_D2yuBq47qafCs1_Qw-UNYxfspNfWC5_FLd__Jb16M1lXWNB_gXNj4_MNGEb09JLY9WgYhPHsWng' alt='FILE - Young people use their phones to view social media in Sydney, Nov. 8, 2024.
