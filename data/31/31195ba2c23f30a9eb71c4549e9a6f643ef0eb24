</ul><h1>L'illumination Intelligente</h1><p>I finished popping the popcorn and made my way back to the living room, where Erica sat on the couch, waiting.</p>
<p>Handing her the bowl, I took out my phone. “Hey, why don’t I set a little mood lighting for movie night?”</p>
<p>Erica sighed. “Brad, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about the lights. Just because we have smart bulbs that allow you to adjust color from your phone doesn’t mean you <em>need</em> to do it all the time.”</p>
<p>She tried to affect a tone of mild frustration, but I could tell she was just jealous of my cool lights. In fact, she was turning green with envy. I could practically see it!</p>
<p>“Exit that app,” Erica said, “right now.”</p>
<p>“But what do you care what color or brightness I set the lights at?” I said. “You’re beautiful no matter what.”</p>
<p>“That’s not going to work on me, Brad,” she said.</p>
<p>And yet, it had worked. She blushed, her cheeks reddening. And also, her whole face. And also the bowl of popcorn.</p>
<p>“Quit it with that damn colors, Brad,” Erica said.</p>
<p>Absentmindedly, she took a bite of popcorn. But it must’ve gotten caught in her throat. Her face turned blue and then purple. Oh god, she was choking!</p>
<p>“What are you–”</p>
<p>“No, babe!” I said. “Don’t talk! Your airway is blocked!”</p>
<p>Erica rolled her eyes. “You’re not going to shut me up that easy.”</p>
<p>And honestly, I didn’t appreciate her tone. It was making me… angry. I could feel the transformation coming on, the muscles on my arms growing taut, my skin turning bright–</p>
<p>“You already did green, remember?”</p>
<p>Dammit, she was right.</p>
