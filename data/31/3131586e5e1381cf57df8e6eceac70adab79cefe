After being <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/18/iphone-drivers-license-13th-state/">announced</a> yesterday, the feature is now live in Illinois.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Wallet IDs are accepted at TSA checkpoints in more than 250 airports, including O'Hare and Midway in Chicago. They can also be used to show proof of age or identity at select businesses and venues, but there is no list of specific locations.<br/>
<br/>
To set up the feature, open the Wallet app and tap on the plus sign in the top-right corner. Next, select Driver's License and ID Cards and follow the steps.<br/>
