I saw <a href="https://mbork.pl/2026-01-12_Making_fill-paragraph_more_flexible">this post from mbork</a> on paragraph filling. It&rsquo;s a nice post and I&rsquo;ll probably write about it later but today I want write about something else he mentioned in his post: <a href="https://github.com/purcell/unfill/blob/master/README.md">unfill.el</a>. It&rsquo;s from Steve Purcell and has been around for a couple of years but I somehow missed it.

Most of my Emacs buffers are set to wrap text, which is usually what you want to do but for writing buffers, such as my blog posts, I use visual line mode and don&rsquo;t want any filling. More often than you&rsquo;d think I would, I find myself writing a blog post or some other prose  and discover that I&rsquo;m filling text lines.

My usual solution to this is to let the line length to a large value and call <code>fill-paragraph</code>. That&rsquo;s not very hard but it&rsquo;s a pain and I should have automated it long ago but my laziness kicked in and I never did. Happily, Purcell has done this for me. It does the same thing I did manually but with a single key press. Even better, he provides the <code>unfill=toggle</code> function. If you call it once, it fills the paragraph. If you call it again, it unfills the paragraph. That&rsquo;s nice because you can bind <code>unfill-toggle</code> to <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>q</kbd>, or whatever you usually bind the fill command to, and get both commands for the price of one. In the mean time, I&rsquo;ve installed unfill.el and bound <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>q</kbd> to <code>unfill-toggle</code>. One more tiny nub sanded down.
