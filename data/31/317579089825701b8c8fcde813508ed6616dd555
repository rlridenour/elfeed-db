Apple has marked as private its day-old <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/20/apple-shares-the-parent-presentation-for-mac/">The Parent Presentation video</a> on YouTube, meaning that it is no longer available to watch.<br/>

Apple has also moved The Parent Presentation to the bottom of its <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/college-students/">College Students page</a>, effectively burying it. When we reported on the marketing campaign yesterday, the presentation was prominently featured at the top of the page. <br/>
<br/>
It is unclear why Apple is suddenly hiding the ad, or if it will return. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.<br/>
<br/>
On social media, some people said that the ad was cringe or gross, so perhaps Apple pulled the video due to overly negative reception. To be clear, this is merely speculation, and there were others who found humor in the video.<br/>

Teenagers can be a tough crowd to impress.<br/>
<br/>
It would not be the first time that Apple pulled ads from YouTube that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/apple-crush-ad-apology/">did not go over well</a>, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-pulls-iphone-16-ad-more-personal-siri/">became the subject of a class action lawsuit</a>.<br/>

The Parent Presentation is a customizable slideshow that explains why a Mac is a useful tool in college. The presentation is <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fnB7HrN6fRFM9hNtnhbXdVepRxuJxZ84_aTTu4VECwg/template/preview">available to download</a> for free in PowerPoint, Keynote, and Google Slides formats. Students can customize the presentation slides, and then show it to their parents to convince them to buy them a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
In an accompanying YouTube video shared by Apple, comedian Martin Herlihy showed a group of high school students how to effectively use The Parent Presentation.<br/>
