<p>A couple of weeks ago, <em>Scientific American</em> published <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/game/math-puzzle-wrangle-rectangles/">this puzzle</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Overlapping rectangle puzzle" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2025/20251231-Overlapping%20rectangle%20puzzle.png" title="Overlapping rectangle puzzle" width="80%"/></p>
<p>There are nine overlapping rectangles, A through I. They overlap one another in a specific pattern using a notation I hadn’t seen before:</p>
<pre><code>A\(D, F)    F\(A, B, I)
B\(F, G)    G\(B, C, I)
C\(G, H)    H\(C, D, E)
D\(A, H)    I\(E, F, G)
E\(H, I)
</code></pre>
<p>This means that rectangle A overlaps with two rectangles: D and F; rectangle F overlaps with three rectangles: A, B, and I; and so on. The goal is to correctly label the rectangles in the image.</p>
<p>My sense of the “right” way to handle this puzzle is to think of it as a network and use some powerful result from graph theory to solve it in an instant. But since the only thing I know about graph theory is that it exists, I went about it differently.</p>
<p>First, I labeled each rectangle with a code that indicates the number of rectangles it intersects and the number of rectangles its overlapping rectangles intersect.</p>
<p><img alt="Overlapping rectangles labeled with intersection counts" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2025/20251231-Overlapping%20rectangles%20labeled%20with%20intersection%20counts.png" title="Overlapping rectangles labeled with intersection counts" width="80%"/></p>
<p>For example, the rectangle at the top is labeled 3–222. That means it intersects three rectangles, and each of those intersecting rectangles intersects with two rectangles. I put the numbers after the dash in increasing order, just as the puzzle puts the rectangle letters in alphabetical order in its notation.</p>
<p>Then I added my notation after the puzzle’s notation:</p>
<pre><code>A\(D, F)     2–23 
B\(F, G)     2–33
C\(G, H)     2–33
D\(A, H)     2–23
E\(H, I)     2–33
F\(A, B, I)  3–223
G\(B, C, I)  3–223
H\(C, D, E)  3–222
I\(E, F, G)  3–233
</code></pre>
<p>The H and I rectangles are unique in my notation, so they could be identified immediately. I then went counterclockwise from H and saw that the leftmost rectangle had to be D (the only 2–23 intersecting H), the one at the bottom had to be A (the only 2–23 intersecting D), and then similarly up from the bottom through F, B, G, and C. E came from its connection to H and I.</p>

<p>When I looked at the SciAm solution, I was disappointed. It was faster than mine, but not because they used some clever math. They basically identified H and I using my method (albeit without my notation), figured out B and E from that, and then “the rest is simple.” It <em>is</em> simple, but it didn’t teach me anything new. Oh well, maybe next year.</p>
