<p>Three weeks ago, Rivian started supporting Apple Wallet car keys. I set it up immediately. (I made a video on it in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macsparky.com/join">MacSparky Labs</a>)</p>



<p>Before this, unlocking my car required pulling out my phone and waiting for a Bluetooth connection. It worked, but it wasn&#8217;t great. Sometimes I&#8217;d be standing at the door like an idiot while my phone figured things out.</p>



<p>One out of fifteen times, it just didn&#8217;t work, and I had to pull out the credit-card style key from my wallet and tap it against the door.</p>



<p>The Wallet car key is different. I walk up, and when I&#8217;m about five feet away, the car unlocks.&nbsp;<em>Every damn time.</em>&nbsp;Three weeks in, it hasn&#8217;t failed once.</p>



<p>I still carry the credit card backup key in my wallet. Old habits. But if this streak continues for another few weeks, that backup is coming out. One less thing to carry.</p>



<p>I hope this goes wide. Every car manufacturer should be on board with this.</p>
