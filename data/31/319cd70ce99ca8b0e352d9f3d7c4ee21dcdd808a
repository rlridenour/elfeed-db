I export to HTML fairly often with orgmode. In this case &ldquo;export and open&rdquo; resulting in viewing the code is almost never what I want; it would be much more useful like the export pdf option, which doesn&rsquo;t view to the LaTeX code but right to the PDF.
Answer As per https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/2387/browser-not-opening-when-exporting-html-from-org-mode
A setting change fixed this. M-x customize-variable org-file-apps and for files of type \\.x?html?\\' I specified firefox %s. Now it does what I want.
