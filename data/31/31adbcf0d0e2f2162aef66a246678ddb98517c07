<p>In spite of her sniffle<br />
Isabel&#8217;s chiffle.<br />
Some girls with a sniffle<br />
Would be weepy and tiffle;<br />
They would look awful,<br />
Like a rained-on waffle,<br />
But Isabel&#8217;s chiffle<br />
In spite of her sniffle.<br />
Her nose is more red<br />
With a cold in her head,<br />
But then, to be sure,<br />
Her eyes are bluer.<br />
Some girls with a snuffle,<br />
Their tempers are uffle.<br />
But when Isabel&#8217;s snivelly<br />
She&#8217;s snivelly civilly,<br />
And when she&#8217;s snuffly<br />
She&#8217;s perfectly luffly.</p>
<p>&#8212; Ogden Nash</p>
