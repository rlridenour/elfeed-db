<p>The European Commission has fined Elon Musk’s social media platform X €120 million (about US$140 million) for breaching the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA), saying the company failed to meet transparency obligations on advertising, data access and its paid blue-check system. X is accused of providing deceptive information around verified checkmarks, not giving researchers and authorities required access to platform data, and not clearly labelling or explaining targeted advertising to users. Musk rejected the decision and responded online by saying the &quot;EU should be abolished&quot; and calling the bloc a &quot;bureaucratic monster,&quot; arguing that regulations are smothering innovation and that power should return to individual European countries. The case highlights widening tensions between EU regulators seeking stricter oversight of large platforms and some US political figures and business leaders who describe the enforcement of the DSA as censorship or an attack on American technology companies.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/5KQnhR80iKiyVZhXD-nH2tS78tdBwo9_hXZJ6LoOaKF12ziAHvbBvXSPMhWvgCbe2EcoqPJ79KBfIyQm-JfB8ug33sRyDSZzeEqpzWQ03103DjEe6TMhvA_dM6rDL9wbYf5Wuw1WTeD6ND48IeBJXEynQF9gHTFJUEPU' alt='Elon Musk speaks at an event in front of the X logo, as debate intensifies over EU digital rules and platform regulation.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Alleged DSA breaches: EU regulators say X’s blue-check subscription feature misleads users about account authenticity, and that the platform did not provide mandated data access for researchers nor adequate transparency around political and commercial advertising under the Digital Services Act.</li><li>Musk’s promised response: Musk wrote on X that there would be a &quot;response&quot; against the individuals who imposed the fine, signalling he may challenge the decision or target specific officials, although no concrete legal steps have yet been detailed.</li><li>US diplomatic criticism: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President J.D.
