<p>President Trump withdrew his endorsement of Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she publicly criticized his handling of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and questioned aspects of his foreign policy, a split reported over the weekend. Greene said private security firms contacted her with &quot;warnings for my safety&quot; after the president&#x27;s posts and accused him of fueling threats; she has pushed for the Justice Department to release remaining Epstein-related files, which she says prompted the break. The dispute is drawing attention because it exposes growing fractures inside the MAGA coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm season.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/MKZm3ZWe7BwiXCD6aKhTRGWfyPuyv4ZO-LryMHnC42N2_gdEr9ZJmLOWrc51AMDNigP9scPZ-ePE7mNnzJbPuKH3suVgNHPmr6V8CkiniF-KTb1F0SZiGAIgBumt64hDL5PPAR_-M_79wJlV7tzFissXhWqKU5i7BIWnx9GYpQ7eBp473JXKSFpXRE18t1HfkNzgQiHG8gfYtR6NXPBwRAb5pX1-kn4eVmj3k8KS-7-Zyf-58Gc6ZqAymunz' alt='Once considered one of President Trump&#x27;s fiercest allies, Marjorie Taylor Greene has found herself an outcast of the MAGA firm.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Campaign calculus: Trump reportedly shared a poll showing Greene with about 12% approval in Georgia and advised her not to run, a factor cited in his decision to withdraw endorsement.</li><li>Rhetoric from Trump: The president publicly accused Greene of becoming a &#x27;traitor&#x27; and said she had gone &#x27;far left&#x27;, language that signaled a sharp personal rupture.</li><li>Push for Epstein files: Greene has pressed the Justice Department to release remaining documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein and suggested the endorsement withdrawal was intended to intimidate other Republicans before a vote on those files.</li><li>Midterm implications: Analysts warn the dispute could deepen factional divisions within the MAGA movement and complicate GOP unity ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</li></ul><blockquote>A hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world - Marjorie Taylor Greene</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: The president announced he was withdrawing his support and endorsement for Rep.
