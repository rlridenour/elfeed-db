<p>Having not revisited <a href="https://amzn.to/YEeW3o"><em>The Hobbit</em></a> in some time, I’ve felt the familiar pull—shared by many readers—to return to Tolkien’s fairy-tale novel itself. It was my first exposure to Tolkien, and the perfect book for a young reader ready to dive into moral complexity and a fully-realized fictional world.</p>
<p>And what better guide could there be through <em><a href="https://amzn.to/YEeW3o">The Hobbit</a> </em>than Tolkien himself, reading (above) from&nbsp;the <a href="https://amzn.to/YEeW3o">1937 </a><a href="https://amzn.to/YEeW3o">work</a>? In this 1952 recording in two parts (part 2 is below), the venerable fantasist and scholar reads from his own work for the first time on tape.</p>

<p class="p1">Tolkien begins with a passage that first describes the creature Gollum; listening to this description again, I am struck by how much differently I imagined him when I first read the book. The Gollum of <em>The Hobbit</em> seems somehow hoarier and more monstrous than many later visual interpretations. This is a minor point and not a criticism, but perhaps a comment on how necessary it is to return to the source of a mythic world as rich as Tolkien’s, even, or especially, when it’s been so well-realized in other media. No one, after all, knows Middle Earth better than its creator.</p>

<p>These readings were part of a much longer recording session, during which Tolkien also read (and sang!) extensively from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. A YouTube user has collected, in several parts, a radio broadcast of that full session, and it’s certainly worth your time to listen to it all the way through.&nbsp;It’s also worth knowing the neat context of the recording. Here’s the text that accompanies the video on YouTube:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Tolkien visited a friend in August of 1952 to retrieve a manuscript of The Lord of the Rings, he was shown a “tape recorder”. Having never seen one before, he asked how it worked and was then delighted to have his voice recorded and hear himself played back for the first time. His friend then asked him to read from The Hobbit, and Tolkien did so in this one incredible take.</p></blockquote>
