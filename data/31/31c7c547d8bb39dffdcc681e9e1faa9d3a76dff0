<li>Real flames you can control with a remote</li>
<li>Safety features galore (for example, they immediately extinguish if they tip)</li>
<li>Each liquid paraffin refill provides 50 hours of burn time (and you get 10 of them!)</li>
<li>Buy more refills <a href="https://sidedeal.com/deals/4-pack-ludela-refills-8">on SideDeal</a> if you want (we’d recommend it as once these are gone, they’re gone)</li>
<li>Is it available in Georgia Red: Nope, just white unfortunately</li>
</ul><h1>Real Fire</h1><p>Did you know that CNET stands for “Candles ‘n’ Electronics/Technology”? Yeah, the original intention of the site was to cover those two product categories equally, but over time, they grew more and more focused on the second one.</p>
<p>Okay, fine. We just made that up.</p>
<p>But, get this: <em>these</em> candles have been reviewed on CNET. Why? Because they’re cool, that’s why.</p>
<p>You see, we’ve sold a lot of candles. We’ve sold scented candles. We’ve sold LED lanterns that flicker. We’ve even sold candles made of real wax with fake wicks developed by Disney to be used in the haunted mansion (or something like that).</p>
<p>But these are some of the most impressive we’ve ever gotten our hands on.</p>
<p>Because they produce real flames and yet can be controlled by a remote. Plus, they have a bunch of built-in safety features. For example, they won’t just light up when you touch the on button by accident, and they’ll put themselves out if they tilt or you touch the top.</p>
<p>Here’s a video showing all this stuff in action:</p>

<p>Pretty rad, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/ludela-gen2-candle-review-real-flame-via-remote-control/">CNET thought so</a>, giving them a solid 7.9.</p>
<p>Here’s the final verdict from over there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not something most people need, but LuDela’s remote control candle makes sense for anyone who regularly lights pillar candles in their home. Sure, you can pick up a plain white pillar candle of the same size for anywhere from $10 to $20 – but that’s also about what you’ll pay for each of those liquid paraffin cartridges, which cost $25 for a 2-pack. That makes the $99 price tag more of a one-time fee for the convenience of remote controls and the safety of automatic shutoff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, you probably noticed something interesting in that. Namely, the price. ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS?! FOR THE CANDLE ALONE?!?! Come on!</p>
<p>Which means this deal would’ve cost about $273 at one point. Which is a lot more than our price of $24.99.</p>
<p>Nice, right?</p>
<p>So get some remote control candles. They’re cool, we swear!</p>
