<p>Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies has approved a bill that reduces penalties for several crimes, including attempted coup, in a way that would sharply shorten former president Jair Bolsonaro’s 27‑year prison term for an alleged coup plot if it becomes law. The late‑night vote in Brasília followed chaotic scenes in the chamber, where left‑wing lawmaker Glauber Braga was dragged away by police after seizing the speaker’s chair and accusing the right of trying to protect Bolsonaro. Supporters of the bill argue it updates sentencing rules and ensures proportional punishment, while opponents say it was rushed through to benefit Bolsonaro personally and undermine accountability for the 2023‑24 coup attempt investigations. The measure must still pass the Senate and could face scrutiny from the Supreme Court before any reduction to Bolsonaro’s sentence, which analysts say would likely bring it down to just over two years, takes effect. Separately, Bolsonaro’s lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to allow him to leave prison temporarily for surgery and then serve time under home detention on health and humanitarian grounds.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/I17sY7RQVlDino0ROTgudfdxKKBXfYewRdzrHsG0W224nOparEVVgfH_C1HA623JuIO7mEDhX-HrMoqB4B_8cnIrOIVc2L2RxBLiEe_paFt78bmyIKfgHLVaUgKrB32Xn-OyXkbs17GC3I36hh1c6Oq9SROLnji-zPCEt5Bro08c3szDaw' alt='Deputy Glauber Braga is removed from Brazil’s lower house before the vote on a bill that could reduce former president Jair Bolsonaro’s sentence, in Brasília on December 9, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Bill’s wider scope: The draft law does not mention Jair Bolsonaro by name but revises sentencing for a list of offenses, including crimes against democratic institutions, meaning other defendants in coup‑related cases could also see penalties reduced if it is enacted.</li><li>Procedure and timing: The lower house leadership scheduled the vote quickly and pushed it through in a single sitting, prompting complaints from opposition deputies who argued that such a far‑reaching change to criminal law deserved longer debate and public consultation.</li><li>Security response: Parliamentary security officers and federal police in riot gear were deployed inside the chamber when tensions rose, forming a cordon around the speaker’s platform as shouting between government and opposition lawmakers intensified.</li><li>Senate’s next step: Senate leaders have indicated they will not automatically fast‑track the same text, suggesting there could be negotiations over the scope of the reductions and possible amendments before any final vote.</li><li>Legal strategy: Bolsonaro’s defense team has coupled its push for sentence‑reduction legislation with court filings that emphasize his medical needs and age, arguing these should justify less restrictive detention conditions while appeals proceed.</li></ul><blockquote>This is part of a coup offensive - Glauber Braga</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Supporters of the bill in Congress: Backers in the lower house say the legislation modernizes sentencing rules and prevents what they describe as overly harsh punishments in political cases, framing it as a way to restore balance to Brazil’s criminal code rather than a measure written solely for Jair Bolsonaro.
