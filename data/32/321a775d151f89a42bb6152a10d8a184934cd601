<p>In the latest development, Hamas returned two more Israeli hostages&#x27; bodies via the Red Cross as Israel warned it will resume military operations if Hamas fails to comply with the U.S.-backed truce’s terms on returning remains [euronews.com#1][france24.com#2]. The Israeli military also said earlier that one body handed over this week did not match any of the hostages on its list [euronews.com#1][theguardian.com#2]. Hamas says it has delivered all the remains it can currently reach and needs specialized recovery equipment to retrieve others from beneath Gaza’s rubble, a challenge the Red Cross has also highlighted given the scale of destruction [nytimes.com#2][firstpost.com#1][pbs.org#1]. President Trump said he would consider allowing Israel to resume fighting if Hamas does not uphold the deal, while also acknowledging the difficulty of locating bodies under debris [firstpost.com#3][aljazeera.com#1]. Israel said it will reopen the Rafah crossing today to allow humanitarian aid and construction materials into Gaza, even as funerals begin in Israel and authorities say 19 slain hostages’ remains are still unreturned; the last 20 living hostages were freed on Monday under the truce’s first phase [france24.com#1][nytimes.com#1][apnews.com#1][pbs.org#2][timesofisrael.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/q_X8qY_zocYQCBxMbcEC1PLP_Lzv8M89JbRXNeshlvBKAtQXUwWmGMbwUmdRJ_z0eY-F7W6LMXNNJ6XmkdeBtmgVflrVO2yuhTv1q7a3AhMCHpWbd8wZ4C8cislMk0rAN5-cfGlzRePQLsDbZcY_eoQyOiTGXmvaN-oPCuVAG9uSoNnUiBlImsgNUD8uzQV8-esUFuHTHZZNkRTYrAPtJPcai-s7-VHSOGBURw' alt='Mourners accompany a returned hostage’s coffin during a funeral in Israel.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Recovery obstacles: The Red Cross and Hamas say collapsed buildings and deep rubble make recovery of remains extremely difficult without heavy machinery, complicating timelines promised under the truce [pbs.org#1][nytimes.com#2].</li><li>Aid leverage: After Israel threatened to restrict aid over delays, Hamas handed over additional remains, while Israeli officials warned further steps if obligations aren’t met [foreignpolicy.com#1][firstpost.com#4][france24.com#2].</li><li>Identified victims: Israel identified the two latest returned as Inbar Haiman and Muhammad el-Atrash, as families began burials and mourning ceremonies [timesofisrael.com#1][nytimes.com#1].</li><li>Ceasefire framework: The first phase of the truce freed the last 20 living hostages alongside prisoner exchanges, but disputes now center on unreturned bodies and humanitarian access [pbs.org#2][france24.com#2].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israel’s defense ministry: Warns fighting in Gaza will resume if Hamas fails to fully comply with the ceasefire terms.
