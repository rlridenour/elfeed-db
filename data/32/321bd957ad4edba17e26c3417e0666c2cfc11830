<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/g3nsgg/mumu4e_14_has_been_released/">mu/mu4e 1.4 is out</a>. About a week ago, I built and installed its <a href="https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/tag/1.3.10">pre-release version (1.3.10)</a> and noted <a href="http://xenodium.com/building-mumu4e-on-macos/">build steps on macOS</a>. It's been working great for me. Today, I updated to 1.4.</p>
<p>I was keen to try the new release out. I had been experiencing a short delay immediately after syncing/indexing mail. An initial investigation pointed to contact syncing, but I didn't dig further. The 1.4 release notes had a promising entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many cases, `mu4e' used to receive <em>all</em> contacts after each indexing operation; this was slow for some users, so we have updated this to <em>only</em> get the contacts that have changed since the last round.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After upgrading. The delay is gone for me ø/</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: there are a few config tweaks needed for the 1.4 upgrade, but these are well-documented in the <a href="https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/tag/1.4">release notes</a>. For me, it primarily consisted of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swapping elisp <em>mu4e-maildir</em> var for <em>mu init –maildir path/to/local/IMAP</em>.</li>
<li>Swapping elisp <em>mu4e-user-mail-address-list</em> for <em>mu init –my-address address1@domain.com –my-address address2@domain.com</em>.</li>
<li>Disabling <em>mu4e-maildirs-extension</em> (not yet compatible with mu 1.4). No issues here, since I hardly ever look at the <em>mu4e-main</em> buffer. I have global binding to my unread messages that looks a little something like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(defun ar/mu4e-view-unread-messages ()
  (interactive)
  (mu4e-headers-search-bookmark (concat &quot;flag:unread AND &quot;
                                        &quot;flag:unread AND &quot;
                                        &quot;NOT flag:trashed AND &quot;
                                        &quot;(maildir:/box1/INBOX OR &quot;
                                        &quot;maildir:/box2/INBOX)&quot;)))
