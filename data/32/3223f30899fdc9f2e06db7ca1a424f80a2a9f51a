<p>&#8220;Whatever reasons there are that might justify the state saying that free speech is not being protected, the fact that some people felt intimidated by the permitted rowdy and contentious speech of others cannot be among them.  <span id="more-53428"></span> Yet our supposed defenders of free speech continually resort to this cowardly line of argument, and ironically enough end up being the greatest enemies of free speech there are, given their support from powerful factions in the state, press, and even some upper administrations.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s <a href="https://www.liamkofibright.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liam Kofi Bright</a> (LSE) writing at his blog, <a href="https://sootyempiric.blogspot.com/2025/04/the-free-speech-world-is-rowdy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Sooty Empiric</em></a>.</p>
<p>His post was prompted by the decision of the UK government&#8217;s Office for Students (OfS) (whose <a href="https://dailynous.com/2023/05/10/philosopher-to-be-appointed-uks-first-free-speech-tsar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;free speech czar&#8221;</a> is philosopher Arif Ahmed), to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/26/university-of-sussex-fined-freedom-of-speech-investigation-kathleen-stock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fine the University of Sussex £585,000</a> after its investigation into how the university handled the case of philosopher Kathleen Stock, who <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/10/28/kathleen-stock-resigns-from-sussex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resigned</a> after <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/10/08/students-at-sussex-campaign-to-get-philosopher-fired/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">students protested</a> her views and called for her to be fired.</p>
<p><em>The Guardian</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/26/university-of-sussex-fined-freedom-of-speech-investigation-kathleen-stock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>:</p>
<p class="dcr-16w5gq9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The OfS criticism was directed at the university’s trans and non-binary equality policy statement, which required course materials to “positively represent trans people” and said “transphobic propaganda … will not be tolerated”. The regulator said it had “a chilling effect”, which could result in staff and students self-censoring.</em></p>
<p class="dcr-16w5gq9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“An example of this chilling effect materialising in practice is the experience of Prof Stock while at the university. Prof Stock said that she became more cautious in her expression of gender critical views as a result of the policy,” the OfS said.</em></p>
<p class="dcr-16w5gq9" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“There were some views she did not feel able to express, and therefore teach, despite those views being lawful. Other staff and students may have felt similarly unable to express these, or other, lawful views, and not speak about or express lawful views.”</em></p>
<p>The full report of the OfS is <a href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/media/hcllzxwx/university_sussex_free_speech_case_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The policy (which you can read <a href="https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=trans-and-non-binary-equality-policy-statement.pdf&amp;site=369" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) is largely about equal opportunity and treatment for trans students, and about the unacceptability of &#8220;abuse, harassment, or bullying&#8221; directed at trans people because they&#8217;re trans.</p>
<p>The focus on the policy seems a bit disingenuous.</p>
<p>As the university’s vice-chancellor, Sasha Roseneil, noted:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Universities must be able to have policies and expectations of behaviour that support respectful communication and enable us to manage cultural tensions on campus&#8230; Under this ruling, we believe that universities would not be permitted to expect their staff and students to treat each other with civility and respect.</em></p>
<p>And as readers will recall, it was the <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/10/08/students-at-sussex-campaign-to-get-philosopher-fired/">student protests and signs</a> that were cited as the problem at the time; Stock herself lauded the university leadership when she decided to <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/10/28/kathleen-stock-resigns-from-sussex/">resign</a>.</p>
<p>So what seems to have happened is that, using the fig leaf of a policy problem, the UK government is punishing a university for allowing protests of trans-exclusionary or &#8220;gender critical&#8221; views.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some more of Bright&#8217;s commentary:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Let me say what it is that bothers me about the UK&#8217;s current attitude to protecting campus free speech. What bothers me is we let &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; arguments constitute violations of our free speech, as per the Education Secretary quoted <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn9vr4vjzgqo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The same article quotes Dr. Ahmed, head of the Office for Students&#8217; free speech wing, saying his group were &#8220;concerned that a chilling effect may have caused many more students and academics at the university to self-censor&#8221;. So it seems that the earlier cited fact that &#8220;[p]osters were put up on the campus calling for [Kathleen Stock] to be sacked, and students turned up with placards at an open day&#8221; is the sort of thing that prompted action here. And I think that is absurd. I think that leads to violations of free speech, like the one Sussex is suffering from!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Free speech protections only arise as an issue where there is controversy. If nobody felt particularly strongly on a matter the issue simply doesn&#8217;t arise. But if, say, someone publishes a paper saying &#8220;Black people are less intelligent than white people&#8221; then presumably black people are not going to like that. So maybe me and my buddies decide to express our unhappiness publicly with our (free!) speech, and stand in the campus quod shouting &#8220;fuck that guy&#8221;. Indeed we might even say that he should be fired, or at least never be employed. Well, this is all very heated, all very rowdy&#8230; but so far no one&#8217;s free speech rights are being infringed. You could make the case that if anyone calls for the person to be fired then they are clearly calling for a world with less free speech, but unless there is some serious reason to believe that us saying this will actually prompt action from the university so far it&#8217;s all just so much hot air. In fact, all this is what we should expect it to look like in a world with free speech protections! People have the freedom to say stuff that upsets others, and those who are upset have the right to make it clear how they feel about this and the person saying it. They may even be unreasonable in so doing. That&#8217;s what happens when you are angry! This is the sort of issue where free speech protections actually matter, and so far they are working as planned.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Chilling effect arguments allow this to get transmuted into a bad thing!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Because now suppose the 1st person claims they can&#8217;t publish their follow up paper (&#8220;Black people are ugly&#8221;) because they&#8217;re afraid of me and my buddies saying mean things about them. Sure, they weren&#8217;t actually fired, but us saying we thought they ought to be was very distressing. Since they don&#8217;t want to be distressed they don&#8217;t want to publish the paper since they know that will start a causal chain that ends up with them feeling distressed. Now, if that counts as a reason for state action to punish the university (unless the university takes proactive steps to silence us) then suddenly speech has become punishable! But it&#8217;s the protestors whose speech is suppressed, all in the name of protecting free speech! (And notice how the chilling-effect way of framing things inevitably favours those who are less likely to have people saying stuff about how much their group sucks. Restrictions on free speech are, ever, a tool to protect the antecedently powerful; they only ever can be.) The inevitable rowdiness of the world with free speech is taken as reason to suppress speech! </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The lesson I take from this is: a genuine regime of free speech requires an attitude of learning to accept that people will be rowdy and mean and unreasonable and say you shouldn&#8217;t have a job and all sorts of things. Sometimes this will, genuinely, suck and be unreasonable. Free speech is better if we all display virtues of reasonableness and keeping a calm head &#8211; and we don&#8217;t always! (I initially included links to work illustrating the sort of unpleasant statements that get made re black people, but I eventually decided not to precisely because I didn&#8217;t trust readers not to go and harass the author(s).) I am not saying we should celebrate that people do this, only that our means of responding to it should not be to institutionally punish them. </em></p>
