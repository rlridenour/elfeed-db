Google this week targeted the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> in an ad for the Pixel 9 Pro, mocking Apple's design plans and suggesting that Apple often copies Android features.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; isn't released, of course, so Google's ad is based on rumors that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is going to get a horizontal camera bar at the back, which is a Pixel-esque design. Dummy models and mockups of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; depict a thick horizontal camera bar for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models, and a slimmer, more Pixel-style camera bar for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Google's Pixel lineup has long used a horizontal camera bar, but it has lenses arranged in a horizontal line. Apple plans to continue to use a triangular arrangement for the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models, and will simply expand the camera bump.<br/>
<br/>
In the ad, Google points out that the Pixel had a horizontal camera bar first, before delving into other features that Apple has allegedly copied. The video is positioned as a "podcast" featuring a Pixel phone and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<blockquote>Pixel: Hi, I'm Pixel, and this is my friend, iPhone.<br/>
iPhone: Good day.<br/>
Pixel: There are a lot of rumors circulating about iPhone's upcoming redesign.<br/>
iPhone: It's crazy. Can you imagine me doing the same thing you did first years later?</blockquote><br/>
Google highlights <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-mode/">Night Mode</a>, Clean Up, and widgets as examples of features that were available on Android first. The video wraps up with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; copying a line that the Pixel says first: "We want to remind everyone that these rumors are just rumors."<br/>
<br/>
"Please don't go repeating everything you see," reads the video description. Google has used the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android ad format <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/21/google-pixel-anti-iphone-ad-series/">in the past</a> to mock Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; design decisions, most recently targeting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/google-pokes-fun-iphone-15-usb-c-adoption/">Apple's switch to USB-C</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/google-mocks-iphone-17-design/">Google Mocks iPhone 17 Design Rumors in Pixel 9 Pro Ad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-mocks-iphone-17-design-rumors-in-pixel-9-pro-ad.2456636/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
