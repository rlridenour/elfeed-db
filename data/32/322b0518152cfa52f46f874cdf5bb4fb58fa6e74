This week also saw the first beta of iOS 18.5, a new rumor about iOS 19 compatibility, and Apple's work on haptic buttons that have yet to surface on the iPhone, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18.4 Released: Here's Everything New</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-4-features-2/">released iOS 18.4 to the general public</a>, following more than a month of beta testing. While the personalized Siri features that were originally expected to debut in iOS 18.4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">have been delayed</a>, the software update still includes a handful of new features and changes for iPhones, so be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-4-features-2/">list of everything new</a>.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>iOS 19 Rumored to Drop Support for These iPhones</h2><br/>
A private account on X that accurately shared iOS 18 compatibility details last year is back with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/ios-19-expected-to-run-on-these-iphones/">list of iPhone models that iOS 19 will allegedly support</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Unlike iOS 18, which maintained compatibility with the same iPhone models that can run iOS 17, the upcoming iOS 19 update is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/ios-19-expected-to-run-on-these-iphones/">expected to drop support for three older iPhone models</a>, so be sure to check out the list to see if the device that you use might be affected.<br/>
<br/>
The first iOS 19 beta should be available <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/">on June 9</a>, and the update should be released to the general public in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases New Firmware for AirPods Max With Lossless Audio Support</h2><br/>
After a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/new-airpods-max-firmware-unavailable/">false alarm</a>, Apple has followed through with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/airpods-max-7e101-firmware/">releasing an AirPods Max firmware update</a> that enables support for lossless audio and ultra low-latency audio on the over-ear headphones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/airpods-max-2024-colors.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964775" /><br/>
These features are only available on the newer version of the AirPods Max with a USB-C port, with the older version of the headphones that still have the Lightning port unfortunately missing out on these free upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Reportedly Hasn't Given Up on Haptic Buttons for a Future iPhone</h2><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/apple-hasnt-given-up-on-haptic-buttons/">still exploring solid-state buttons with haptic feedback for future iPhones</a>, according to information shared recently by a known leaker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-15-Pro-Multi-Purpose-button-Mute-Switch-Feature-Green-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-890432" /><br/>
It was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/kuo-iphone-15-pro-models-solid-state-buttons/">widely reported</a> that Apple intended to introduce solid-state buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro models in 2023, but it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-iphone-15-pro-no-solid-state-buttons-after-all/">canceled the plan</a> at a late stage. The buttons were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-16-pro-solid-state-buttons/">again rumored</a> for the iPhone 16 Pro models, before being shelved indefinitely. They are not expected on the iPhone 17 Pro models, but it seems like the project is still alive.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything New in the iOS 18.5 Beta</h2><br/>
Following the release of iOS 18.4 earlier this week, Apple has already moved on to the next version, with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-5-beta-features/">first iOS 18.5 beta already available to developers for testing</a>. So far, iOS 18.5 includes only a few minor changes, as outlined in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-5-beta-features/">list of everything new</a>.<br/>
<br/>

iOS 18.5 could gain new features and other changes in later betas, but it is currently shaping up to be a minor update, as Apple starts shifting its focus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/29/ios-19-rumors-recap/">towards iOS 19</a>.<br/>
