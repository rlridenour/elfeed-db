<p>US aviation authorities abruptly halted flights in and out of El Paso International Airport, on the US-Mexico border, after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a notice citing “special security reasons” and initially indicated restrictions could last up to 10 days. The shutdown ultimately lasted only several hours, and flights resumed after the FAA said the temporary closure had been lifted and that there was no threat to commercial aviation. Public explanations for what prompted the halt differed across officials and subsequent reporting, with accounts ranging from an external drone incursion near the border to U.S. government counter-drone activity and coordination issues among agencies involved. The episode highlighted cross-border concerns about drones and the need for clearer inter-agency communication.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/cSonL6Gmvcn-FhvJk3d5AdW273zijvOyDuWYgs_NhrvghPbXOIdZvBXA0cnBAB3WmbaPPXuimNBsRzIzDBf6vI7SFTYs8vblUSslesEkTb5E0vl1Kc_ctobVrEeu9ffu6qywilNAJwTLgDunvKUZmMQrP-qeSri_VYj7A4cXMUBCZ6AAuMuJYIWK6Lj1xUkADvai_bsZ-AXbmGgmIo8ONCX_WGu8mxALr_glO85mhJa6ZSdxYdl45SZK8jAq6qBe8beY740lMh6cWJ-D0Q' alt='Cars cross the Paso del Norte International Bridge at the U.S.-Mexico border between Ciudad Juárez and El Paso on Feb. 11, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Safety scope: The FAA notice was unusually broad, halting flights at El Paso International and restricting nearby airspace, including around Santa Teresa, New Mexico; some reports said the original order also restricted certain medical evacuation flights transiting the area.</li><li>Laser involvement: Separate reporting said the Pentagon had authorized Customs and Border Protection to use a laser-based counter-drone system in the El Paso area, and that the FAA shutdown reflected concern about safely deconflicting that activity with civilian air traffic.</li><li>Cartel drone context: Separate reporting highlighted that Mexican cartels have used drones for surveillance, smuggling and attacks against rivals, adding context to why officials would treat drone reports near the border as a serious security issue.</li><li>Conflicting narratives: One version of events cited in reporting suggested a balloon may have been mistaken for a drone, adding to the mix of explanations and public confusion.</li><li>What ‘neutralized’ meant: In accounts attributing the shutdown to cartel drones, officials said the threat was “neutralized,” but details of how were not publicly spelled out; related reporting noted the Pentagon has electronic-jamming capabilities that can disable drones.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Mexico’s government: Mexican officials said they had “no information” about drones at the border in response to the US claims.
