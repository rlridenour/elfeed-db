<blockquote>
  <p>When President Trump arrived in the snow-covered Swiss Alps on
Wednesday afternoon, European leaders were panicking that his
efforts to acquire Greenland would trigger a trans-Atlantic
conflagration. By the time the sun set, Trump had backed down.</p>

<p>After a meeting with Rutte on Wednesday, Trump called off promised
tariffs on European nations, contending that he had “formed the
framework of a future deal” with respect to the largest island in
the world. [...] During an hourlong speech at the World Economic
Forum, the U.S. president said he wouldn’t deploy the military to
take control of Greenland. It was a stark shift in tone for Trump,
who just days earlier had declined to rule out using the military
to secure ownership of Greenland and posted an image online of the
territory with an American flag plastered across it.</p>

<p>No need for panic. Alarm, yes. Panic, no. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/11/trump-chickens-out-again">The TACO theory</a> holds. Stand up to Trump and he’ll chicken out.</p>
