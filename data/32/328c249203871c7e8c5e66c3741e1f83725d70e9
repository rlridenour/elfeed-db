Kuo shared the prediction on <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1924150858549514640">X (Twitter)</a>. He provided no additional details on the weight reduction that Apple plans to make to its over-ear noise-canceling headphones. <br/>
<br/>
Apple updated the AirPods Max in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-announces-new-airpods-max/">September</a>, receiving a USB-C charging port instead of Lightning, and new color options. <em>Bloomberg</em> reported in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airpods-max-2-not-yet-planned/">November</a> that Apple currently has "no concrete plans" to update the headphones again "in a meaningful way."<br/>
<br/>
AirPods Max weigh 13.6 ounces (386.2 grams). Apple says the headband is designed to distribute weight and reduce on-head pressure, but some users find that the stainless steel and aluminum design puts weight on the ears that can become uncomfortable after longer periods of wear. <br/>
