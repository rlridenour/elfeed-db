<p>A double limerick by <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_AM1AAAAMAAJ&#038;pg=PA4">Walter de la Mare</a>:</p>
<p>There was a young lady of Rheims,<br />
There was an old poet of Gizeh;<br />
He rhymed on the deepest and sweetest of themes,<br />
She scorned all his efforts to please her:<br />
And he sighed, &#8220;Ah, I see,<br />
She and sense won&#8217;t agree.&#8221;<br />
So he scribbled her moonshine, mere moonshine, and she,<br />
With jubilant screams, packed her trunk up in Rheims,<br />
Cried aloud, &#8220;I am coming, O Bard of my dreams!&#8221;<br />
And was clasped to his bosom in Gizeh.</p>
