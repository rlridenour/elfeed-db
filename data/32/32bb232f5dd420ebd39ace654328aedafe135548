<p>Overnight gunfire and explosions were reported around Diori Hamani International Airport in Niamey, Niger, prompting a heavy security deployment around the site on Thursday. Residents near the airport said the shooting and detonations began shortly after midnight, and the airport complex sits beside Base Aérienne 101, a military facility. Two security sources cited by one outlet described the incident as a “terrorist attack”, while other reporting said the cause was not yet known and authorities had not publicly commented. Local sources told another outlet that fighting lasted until about 2:00 a.m. and that calm later returned, a near-term reassurance for residents even as questions remain about who carried out the attack and why.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ljglUxfmCgBpYokVi0BGVLEZY1wSMGn39NIVeTKmxQbUTEIYjtPH4dFM7ewpJPLV9fZ7TM_pX1QwYZUBp0cURp8hS-i9OIFd35-31lYGDSfnRAzaCzQHAkal0f0mgm26p_VnknQe8oS1b2Wu1UQ84vBGVzMHIUJhMnxRpZLXPLMA3ML3U5SU8nbP8me95GmTwP4F6n5EXhMJROHYYvT3TSHk4kri05ARLWgTm9fk4jgNavrzpEtQozsdAIBAJq5kskq3uPf68X4zMpq-UWM' alt='Security presence near Diori Hamani International Airport in Niamey after overnight blasts were reported.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Aircraft damage: A source cited in one report said two aircraft on the ground were “destroyed” by gunfire, though officials had not confirmed the claim publicly.</li><li>Uranium stored: One outlet reported the airport area is linked to the presence of about a thousand tons of uranium, adding a sensitive security dimension to the site.</li><li>Base proximity: The airport is about 10km from the presidential palace and also houses an air force base, underscoring its strategic importance.</li><li>Militant deaths claim: RT reported that several suspected militants were reportedly killed during the attack, based on its account of the incident.</li><li>Possible drone use: Local sources described anti-aircraft tracers in the sky and suggested they may have been used against drones deployed by attackers.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Security sources (cited by The Straits Times): Two security sources described the incident as a “terrorist attack” and said calm returned by Thursday morning.
