Woot today kicked off a <a href="https://howl.link/vq02vf3ynsrw4">sale on Apple products</a>, and it includes <a href="https://howl.link/pzv6ezuuat2gp">new record low prices on Apple's M3 iPad Air</a> models. You'll see these all-time lows by entering the code APPLEFIVE at checkout to get an additional &#36;5 off your order.<br/>

<br/>
All iPads in this sale come in new condition and with a 90 day Woot limited warranty. Woot says that the extra APPLEFIVE coupon code will last through September 26 at 11:58 p.m. Central Time, but the overall Apple product sale lasts through October 8 or while supplies last.<br/>
<br/>
With this sale, you can get the <a href="https://howl.link/pzv6ezuuat2gp">11-inch M3 iPad Air (256GB)</a> for &#36;534.00, down from &#36;699.00, and beating Amazon's current low price by &#36;15. The 512GB model is also available on sale for &#36;724.00 after you enter the coupon code, down from &#36;899.00 and undercutting Amazon's deal by &#36;25.<br/>

Woot also has a <a href="https://howl.link/arrnsz1tvkl1b">13-inch M3 iPad Air</a> on sale for a new record low price this week. You can get the 512GB model for &#36;914.00 with the APPLEFIVE coupon, down from &#36;1,099.00, which beats Amazon's current sale by &#36;35. <br/>

<br/>
Shoppers might note that Woot has mislabeled this as an 11-inch iPad Air in the product title, but the price, product description, and model number confirm that it is the 13-inch 512GB model.<br/>
<br/>
Also worth noting is the warranty on these iPads, which is a 90 day Woot limited warranty, and not the typical one year Apple warranty. If these savings aren't worth missing out on Apple's warranty to you, Amazon still has those second-best prices on <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DZ74W8QP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1">nearly every M3 iPad Air model</a> this week.<br/>
