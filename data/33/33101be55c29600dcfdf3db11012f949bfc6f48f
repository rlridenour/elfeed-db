<p>I&#8217;m happy to welcome back <a href="https://directmailmac.com/whats-new?utm_source=macsparky&amp;utm_medium=sponsor">Direct Mail</a>, a true Mac-native email marketing app that&#8217;s been making waves with MacSparky readers.</p>



<p>Most email marketing platforms live in your browser, which means you&#8217;re always one accidental tab close away from losing your work. Or you&#8217;re dealing with a sluggish interface because your internet connection decided to take a coffee break. Direct Mail takes a different approach. It&#8217;s a real Mac app that harnesses your computer&#8217;s power to work faster and more reliably than any web-based solution.</p>

<p>What I appreciate about Direct Mail is how it handles the details that matter. The app features over 50 mobile-optimized templates that you can customize using a drag-and-drop editor. However, it also integrates with macOS features you already use—such as Photos for images and Apple Intelligence Writing Tools for refining your copy. You receive detailed campaign analytics that show not just opens and clicks, but also individual subscriber activity and engagement patterns. And if you&#8217;re using WooCommerce, there&#8217;s now built-in integration that connects your store data directly to your campaigns.</p>



<p>The pricing is refreshingly straightforward. You can send up to 150 emails per month for free forever. Need more? Plans start at $20/month or you can go pay-as-you-go if subscriptions aren&#8217;t your thing.<br>If you&#8217;re tired of fighting with clunky web interfaces, check out Direct Mail. It&#8217;s free to download and try, and you might find that email marketing on the Mac can actually feel&#8230; good. <a href="https://directmailmac.com/whats-new?utm_source=macsparky&amp;utm_medium=sponsor">Check it out.</a></p>
