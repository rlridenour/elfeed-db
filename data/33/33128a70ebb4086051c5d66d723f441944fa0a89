<p>President Trump said he could block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge—a new Detroit, Michigan–Windsor, Ontario crossing—unless Canada “fully compensates” the United States and agrees to talks over what he described as unfair trade treatment. The six-lane bridge is nearing completion after construction that began in 2018, and it is expected to open later this year / later in 2026 after final testing and inspections, according to different reports. In his social media post, Trump said the bridge was built with “virtually no U.S. content” and linked his threat to broader grievances, including Canada’s dairy tariffs and provincial decisions about which alcoholic products to stock in stores. The dispute comes as U.S.-Canada trade relations are already strained, even though the project aims to speed cross-border travel and trade along one of the busiest corridors between the two countries.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/r123JFtH1aCmnYwP-kkxoqcLPsQYYPzjlqp60ZsW8mR2r_GPxNtjxDeXY0mQeLubpXWQvpplhY5LgrKk1HIe2h9gH7aOi3i--nniLIFTHHYnVmjGozUZVP75eSNpWXOibq1zpEZS0y4irqifqy83NzdTpSwF1EhVd4yhU5BIrLOCfyJw8spX6Q28hwFr4EIvhR7k7b83NNaoJKxvFCbKTtp-2O_91_QUbCE69LgVD9HVUZLpJiYTUGXXxGfUCS6jFPA' alt='The Gordie Howe International Bridge linking Detroit and Windsor ahead of its planned opening.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Funding agreement: A Canada-Michigan crossing agreement signed in June 2012 says Canada will pay for the bridge and recoup costs over time using toll revenue collected over 30 years.</li><li>Ownership structure: Multiple outlets say the Canadian government fully paid for the bridge, and reporting describes it as a Canadian-built project with Canada retaining ownership/operational control under the project framework.</li><li>Cost changes: Cost estimates vary by outlet; Time describes it as a $4.7 billion bridge, while RT separately reported different higher estimates.</li><li>Domestic politics: The Guardian reported US Democrats planned to force a House vote this week related to President Trump’s tariffs on Canada.</li><li>Why it matters locally: Reporting says the new bridge will add capacity and backup options in the Detroit-Windsor corridor, a major route for cross-border travel and trade.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: Trump said he would not allow the bridge to open until the US is “fully compensated,” and suggested the US should own “perhaps, at least one half” of the asset.
