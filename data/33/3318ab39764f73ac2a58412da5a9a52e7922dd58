Apple's entry-level <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> model is selling poorly, just like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>, according to an Asia-based leaker.<br/>

The Weibo user known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>" said that the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is not selling well and the attempt at delivering a popular, low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> has "failed." That being said, both models are expected to see successors. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to debut in the spring of 2026, while the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; 2 is likely to arrive at a later date owing to a delay. Meanwhile, demand for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup continues to surge, with production orders increasing.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; was introduced earlier this year, offering the A18 chip, an OLED display, the C1 modem, a 48-megapixel camera, and more, for &#36;599. There have been few reports about its sales performance until now.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is widely reported to have seen <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/report-virtually-no-demand-for-iphone-air/">low demand</a>. All production is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/10/next-generation-iphone-air-delayed/">expected to stop</a> by the end of this month. There were plans for a second-generation &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; that would be released alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro in September 2026, but <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-delays-release-next-iphone-air-amid-weak-sales">The Information</a></em> says Apple has decided to delay the fall 2026 launch.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to feature the A19 chip and potentially the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>. The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; 2 is rumored to offer an additional rear camera, a larger battery, and a vapor-chamber for cooling. Apple is seemingly hoping that these enhancements will help lift sales.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e">iPhone 16e (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-17">iPhone 17 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/13/iphone-16e-failed-like-iphone-air/">iPhone 16e Has Apparently &#039;Failed&#039; Just Like iPhone Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-has-apparently-failed-just-like-iphone-air.2471077/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
