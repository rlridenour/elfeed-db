<p>US President Donald Trump said in Washington that he is &quot;a little bit disappointed&quot; and believes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky &quot;isn’t ready&quot; to approve a US-authored proposal aimed at ending the war with Russia, after three days of talks between American and Ukrainian negotiators in Florida ended without agreement on Saturday. Trump claimed Russia is comfortable with the latest version of the plan and suggested that some in Ukraine’s leadership support it, though he did not provide details of the proposal in his public comments. Zelensky, who followed the Florida talks remotely, said in his nightly address that discussions with US representatives were &quot;constructive, although not easy&quot; and stressed that American officials now understand Kyiv’s fundamental positions, which include rejecting any loss of Ukrainian territory. He added that Ukraine &quot;deserves a dignified peace&quot; and plans to consult closely with European leaders in London, Paris and Berlin in the coming days to coordinate positions before talks continue.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/4MOxYlwNWjE5t97FYd_Rzk3m2LiB5gdRudVJVLHeRsKXqBdmHu5eCR-9hCQHiMf7TcBK35URv0P4RYzvc1zLj4u9f-SUot6Cc2xUW8JffjicDUs9tYbOZrpB0dvofXl9xVbkLTXOvkjXYH0f3W9Pelr-un1YwPqoTvez9vIIew' alt='US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in Washington after US–Ukraine peace talks concluded without a deal.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Florida negotiations: US negotiators, including businessman Steve Witkoff and presidential adviser Jared Kushner, held three days of discussions with a Ukrainian delegation in Florida, updating Zelensky by phone on the results before the talks concluded without a breakthrough.</li><li>Key sticking point: Axios and other reports cited by Russian state media say one area of disagreement is whether Ukraine should relinquish control over some territory to Russia, a condition Zelensky has publicly ruled out.</li><li>Russian position: Russian President Vladimir Putin recently reiterated that Moscow expects Kyiv to recognize Russia’s current borders, including Crimea and areas of Donbass, and warned Russian forces would continue operations there if Ukrainian troops do not withdraw under Russia’s ceasefire terms.</li><li>European consultations: Following the US talks, Zelensky is travelling to London to meet European allies, with further meetings expected with French, British and German leaders to align strategies on any future peace framework.</li><li>Ukrainian public message: In his video address after the talks, Zelensky emphasized that peace must be achieved &quot;on Ukrainian terms&quot; and framed the current phase as one of intensive diplomacy with both the US and Europe rather than an imminent signing of any deal.</li></ul><blockquote>The conversation was constructive, although not easy - Volodymyr Zelensky</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Trump told reporters he was &quot;a little bit disappointed&quot; that Zelensky had not yet engaged with the latest US peace proposal and said the Ukrainian leader &quot;isn’t ready&quot; to accept it, while claiming Russia was &quot;fine&quot; with the plan.
