Flameshot is an excellent new screenshot tool to replace Spectacle, the default KDE tool that served me for years until the latest round of software updates. Suddenly out a screenshot utility for my exwm setup, Flameshot more than impressed me with its rapid editing functionality in addition to the nuts-and-bolts screenshots. Then implementing it into my exwm and binding to my printscreen key was easy:
(exwm-input-set-key (kbd &#34;&lt;print&gt;&#34;) (lambda () (interactive) (start-process-shell-command &#34;flameshot gui&#34; nil &#34;flameshot gui&#34;)))
