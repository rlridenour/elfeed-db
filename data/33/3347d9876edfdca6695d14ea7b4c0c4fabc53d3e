In iOS 26, Apple has a helpful new feature that notifies you when your iPhone's camera lens needs cleaning – something Android devices have offered for years. Here's how to turn on this smart notification system.<br/>

Whenever your iPhone's camera is active, iOS 26 monitors the incoming light for signs of reduced clarity or smudging that could indicate a dirty lens. When triggered, you'll see a discrete alert suggesting you clean your camera lens to improve image quality.<br/>
<br/>
To benefit from the feature, you'll need an iPhone running iOS 26 (currently in beta). It's currently unclear which models support Lens Cleaning Hints, but you can check by looking for the following toggle:<br/>
<ol><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Camera</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle on <strong>Lens Cleaning Hints</strong>.</li></ol><br/>

Once enabled, your iPhone will analyze image quality and display a notification in the Camera app when it detects your rear camera lens could benefit from cleaning.<br/>
