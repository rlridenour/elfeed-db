<p>3 and 5 are &#8220;twin primes&#8221;: They&#8217;re two prime numbers that differ by 2. Further such pairs are 5 and 7, and 11 and 13. These pairs get sparser as you travel out the number line, but no one knows whether they eventually cease appearing altogether.</p>
<p>University of Alberta mathematician Leo Moser saw an opportunity in this pattern &#8212; if a prime magic square can be fashioned from the smaller partners in these pairs:</p>
<pre>
  29 1061  179  227

 269  137 1019   71

1049  101  239  107

149   197   59 1091
</pre>
<p>&#8230; then it immediately suggests a second prime square produced from the larger:</p>
<pre>
  31 1063  181  229

 271  139 1021   73

1051  103  241  109

 151  199   61 1093
