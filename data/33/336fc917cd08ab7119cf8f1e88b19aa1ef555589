<p>An inter-island passenger and cargo ferry, the MV Trisha Kerstin 3, sank after midnight off Basilan province in the southern Philippines while traveling from Zamboanga City toward Jolo island in Sulu province. Officials reported at least 15 deaths, with many more rescued as coast guard, navy, and local boats searched for those still unaccounted for. The Philippine Coast Guard said the vessel issued a distress signal hours after departure and that an investigation is underway to determine what caused the sinking.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/EapmT-KC8z0D1ltMaGcFQg6W3Y_upX3mQXqKEHvTw7elN7XDYIWQs5iRo5vUhZ4E4bkt8Wb37lKZ5cL9Yk4MUgIXkmlPDBjK3Y-CnI_OsxPp' alt='Rescuers assist survivors of the sunken MV Trisha Kerstin 3 at a port in Isabela, Basilan province.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Route and load: Officials described the triple-decker, 44-metre ROPAX-type ferry as carrying about 332 passengers and 27 crew on a run toward Jolo, highlighting how vital sea travel is for island communities in the Sulu archipelago.</li><li>Rescue effort: Search teams operated in good weather with help from fishing boats, while military aircraft and vessels were deployed to expand the search area and speed medical evacuation.</li><li>Family helplines: Rescuers in Isabela City said they fielded more than 100 calls from worried relatives as authorities worked to confirm names because retrieval and accounting were still ongoing.</li><li>Possible cause: Coast guard officials said the ferry appeared to have encountered technical problems before going down, and video showed survivors clinging to emergency rafts and some wearing life vests.</li><li>Safety context: The route echoes a 2023 disaster in which 31 people died in a fire aboard the Lady Mary Joy 3, and Dawn reported both vessels were owned by Aleson Shipping Lines.</li></ul><blockquote>There’s a tug in our hearts whenever we pick up a call.
