<p>It&rsquo;s a drop on the bucket, but it&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In every state other than Montana, if police want to know where you have been, rather than presenting evidence and sending a warrant signed by a judge to a company like Verizon or Google to get your geolocation data for a particular set of time, they only need to buy that same data from data brokers&rdquo;</p>
