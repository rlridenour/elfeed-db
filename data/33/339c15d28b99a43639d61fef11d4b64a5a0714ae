<p>Earlier this week, NK and I finished watching the 7th season of The X-Files. Even though there are more seasons to go, I think I&rsquo;m ready to say bye to this show. I was ready since the episode Mulder found out what happened to his sister.</p>
<p>After the show, we watched both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson clips on YouTube, discussing The X-Files (not together, different clips), and as it turns out, Anderson is pretty f-ing cool. Here, have a listen:</p>

<p>After I found out about her tattoos and the dress with the vaginas, I also learned she&rsquo;s the sex therapist (Jean Milburn) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Education_(TV_series)">Sex Education</a>. I immediately decided I&rsquo;m going to watch it - and I just finished the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/81356/season/1/episode/1">first episode</a> 📺.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s my kind of show (I usually don&rsquo;t connect well with high school shows, it just doesn&rsquo;t speak to me that well) but it does have a certain charm. I see myself as a sex-positive person, and this show kind of highlights some principles I agree with in a comic way.</p>
<p>Well, I guess we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
