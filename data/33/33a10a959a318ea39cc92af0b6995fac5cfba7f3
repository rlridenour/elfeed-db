<p>In the latest development, large anti-ICE demonstrations spread across multiple US cities, with Minneapolis remaining a focal point as crowds rallied in freezing weather and organizers urged a nationwide “no work, no school, no shopping” strike to pressure the federal government to scale back immigration enforcement operations. The protests have been fueled by public anger over the fatal shootings of two people — Renee Good and Alex Pretti — during recent enforcement operations in Minneapolis, an incident that multiple outlets say involved federal agents. At the same time, the US Justice Department opened a federal civil rights investigation into Pretti’s killing, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche describing it as a “standard investigation” and saying authorities would examine what happened and the lead-up to the shooting. Separately, journalist Don Lemon was arrested and charged in connection with a protest at a Minnesota church earlier this month; Lemon says he was there as a journalist documenting events, and his lawyer has criticized the arrest as an attack on press freedom.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Nm_JRAzJiax5VrrdTl644vrSMBFBJ0uuTDKTWbA8INEI_13bjgYFcBEA7NmabxJ45EdGqPaFZMsjPjjrCl9zAxZ4uUCe3lvAhttJ__fXdnnwD4EboYDy_6-46HJc6S_C-6w63r4pi3pjhzoHhe-lpx0zFEuqs91Zg5ac_AcGmwkoDCLhO-k' alt='Demonstrators march through downtown calling for an end to ICE operations in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on January 30, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Los Angeles clashes: RT reported that downtown Los Angeles saw tear gas, flash-bang devices and baton charges after some demonstrators tried to breach police lines near the Edward R.
