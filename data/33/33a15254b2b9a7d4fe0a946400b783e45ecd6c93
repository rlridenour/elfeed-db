<p>Are we making progress in philosophy? Or at least in philosophy-themed costumes? Here&#8217;s one way to find out.<span id="more-55479"></span></p>

<p>Ten years ago, I put up a <a href="https://dailynous.com/2015/10/30/which-philosophy-ideas-good-costumes/">post</a> asking which philosophy ideas make for good Halloween costumes.</p>
<p>I included some suggestions:</p>
<p class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" style="padding-left: 80px;"><em>Yes, <strong>Brain in Vat</strong>. We all think we’ve thought of that one already. What else?</em></p>
<p class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" style="padding-left: 80px;"><em><strong>Eternal Recurrence</strong>? You went as that last year! And the year before.</em></p>
<p class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" style="padding-left: 80px;"><em>I suppose you could go as <strong>anything</strong>. Just make a sign that says “p &amp; ¬ p” and walk behind it.</em></p>
<p class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" style="padding-left: 80px;"><em>How would you go about dressing up as the <strong>Categorical Imperative</strong>? Remember, it would have to be the kind of costume everyone could wear.</em></p>
<p class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" style="padding-left: 80px;"><em>Looking for a sexy costume idea? Go as <strong>Philosophy Department Budget</strong>. It barely covers anything.</em></p>
<p>Readers came through with various ideas: turtles all the way down, Moore&#8217;s hands, a duck-rabbit, and so on. You can check them out <a href="https://dailynous.com/2015/10/30/which-philosophy-ideas-good-costumes/">here</a>.</p>
<p>But we barely scratched the surface of possibilities. Since it has been a decade, I thought we could revisit the topic.</p>
<p>There certainly seems to be room for growth, especially when it comes to ideas developed, say, over the past 30 or so years, or ideas from outside the traditional canon. Plus, there are plenty of people reading these words who were not in DN&#8217;s audience back in the day, and I bet they&#8217;ll have some good suggestions. So let&#8217;s hear &#8217;em.</p>
<p>Happy Halloween, philosofriends!</p>
