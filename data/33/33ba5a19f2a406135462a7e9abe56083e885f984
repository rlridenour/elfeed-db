<p>Kwan Wei Kevin Tan, reporting for Business Insider five months ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dario Amodei, the CEO of the AI startup Anthropic, said on Monday
that AI, and not software developers, could be writing all of the
code in our software in a year.</p>

<p>“I think we will be there in three to six months, where AI is
writing 90% of the code. And then, in 12 months, we may be in a
world where AI is writing essentially all of the code,” Amodei
said at a Council of Foreign Relations event on Monday.</p>

<p>Complete bullshit, but, I guess he still has one month to go. (<a href="https://www.threads.com/@davew/post/DNhTsistxCs">Via Dave Winer</a> on Threads.)</p>
