<li>Serious power, on demand when you need it.</li>
<li>Tons of ports and outlets; clear and easy digital display</li>
<li>Solar panels (if you buy ‘em)</li>
<li>Also compatible with the Duracell solar panels <a href="https://sidedeal.com/deals/duracell-heavy-duty-briefcase-solar-panels-100w-or-200w">on SideDeal</a>, just make sure to buy the $14 adapter we linked</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita? It can make your blender run NO MATTER WHAT.</li>
</ul><h1>Don’t Make This Your Hobby</h1><p>You can make a whole lifestyle out of being ready for anything.</p>
<p>Thanks to a combination of unhinged social media influencers, ubiquitous residential delivery, and podcast ads selling you gold and/or military rations, it has never been so fun or so easy to scare the absolute crap out of yourself and your family before equipping the household with a variety of weapons and emergency supplies.</p>
<p>Is this the year we run out of coal? Or are hit by an electromagnetic pulse? Global cyberattack? Banking system collapse? DoorDash service outage?</p>
<p>It could be anything. And you could base your entire personality around stocking up, locking down, and arming yourself to the teeth against whatever is coming.</p>
<p>But that’s also kind of exhausting. (It also makes you tiresome at parties.)</p>
<p>And if you aren’t the kind of person who gets some perverse entertainment value out of worrying about all this stuff, it can all feel like a bit much. Which makes it tempting to not do anything at all to prepare for…anything at all.</p>
<p>Then when something unexpected happens, all you’re left with is a Costco pack of water and that plastic grocery bag full of plastic grocery bags under the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>So while losing yourself down an algorithmically driven rabbit hole about how to prepare for nuclear fallout or the inevitable AI overthrow of the internet, not having any electricity when a tree falls on the power junction up the street is also bad. Less annoying to have you at Thanksgiving, sure. But still bad.</p>
<p>This brings us to today’s deal. It’s a bit of emergency hardware. Or, you know…camping hardware. It’s whatever you think it is.</p>
<p>It’s a modest, thoughtful, and responsible purchase that can help you out in a pinch, whether it’s a random pinch like a natural disaster or a self-imposed one like living out of a tent for a long weekend at a place that doesn’t have cell service.</p>
<p>You’ll notice we have a couple of levels to this offer, from the 512Wh to the 512Wh with solar, then up to the beefier 806Wh or the 806Wh with solar. Decide for yourself just how ready for anything you want to be, but we’re pretty stoked that if all you want to do is have some extra juice on standby if you need it, we can help you accomplish that for just two hundred bucks.</p>
<p>Beyond that? Up to you. Definitely get the big one with the solar panel if you want to have a leg to stand on chatting with Uncle Barry at Thanksgiving, though.</p>
