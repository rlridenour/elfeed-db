Intro Trying to have xscreensaver load my images, I am getting error:
xscreensaver-getimage: file does not exist: &#34;~/wallpapers/angels-phonebox.png&#34; No amount of changing file names, user permissions, etc seems to be effecting this. However, it is obviously seeing that that image (and the others in the directory) ARE there; they should be working.
Answer: don&rsquo;t use a tilde ~ in your file path Local is already presumed, so just setting wallpapers as the directory, rather than &ldquo;~/wallpapers&rdquo;, did the trick.
