</ul><h1>Temper Your Expectations</h1><p>So much of our enjoyment of a food or beverage comes down to the temperature it’s served at.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, speaking of beverages: over on Casemates, <a href="https://casemates.com/">there’s a great offer on the Band Blend from Little Vineyard</a>! We’re talking aromas of cedar and black pepper, with notes of fresh boysenberry, raspberry, and an underlying hint of watermelon. Sounds like a delicious summer red, if you ask us!</p>
<p>Anyway, what were we talking about?</p>
<p>Oh right, serving temperature for food and beverages.</p>
<p>An ice-cold can of seltzer, for example, is a refreshing treat. But room temperature seltzer? It’s like drinking sizzle. And that’s if it’s just plain seltzer. Any essence that, when cool, tastes subtle will start to seem weird and synthetic as it warms.</p>
<p>Same goes in the other direction as well.</p>
<p>Warm macaroni and cheese? Creamy comfort in a bowl. Macaroni and cheese that’s cooled down? Kind of a weird, gloppy mess.</p>
<p>Most of the time, though, this isn’t an issue. As long as you don’t finish cooking an hour before mealtime, the food should be warm when it hits the dinner plate. Likewise, your house probably has something called a refrigerator that can keep not just seltzer but any beverage cold and ready to drink.</p>
<p>Problems arise when it comes time to bring food or beverages to another place. Like, say, a cookout. Or a work potluck. Or a Friendsgiving.</p>
<p>As in: you’ve got something you need to transport. And you don’t want it to get too warm or too cold en route.</p>
<p>Now, there are various ways to keep beverages cold for an extended period of time without refrigeration. You just get an insulated bag, load it with some ice packs, and then fill it with cans. The only problem? The cold doesn’t last indefinitely. Moreover, there’s a chance you go to load up said ice packs and find they’re already in said insulated bag. As in: you forgot to put them <em>back</em> in the freezer after the last time you used them. So they’re not frozen.</p>
<p>As for that hot dish you’re bringing: your best option traditionally has been to be that annoying person who says, “Hey, can I borrow your oven a minute?” As if the people hosting whatever event you’re attending have no cooking to do themselves.</p>
<p>But now, there’s a better way. You get one of these.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s an insulated bag that will heat itself up or cool itself down. You put whatever you want in it. Then you plug it into your car with its travel adapter and head wherever you’re going. Once you get there, you can plug it into the wall if you need to keep your contribution warm or cold for a bit longer.</p>
<p>Which means your favorite beverage or side can be enjoyed at the right temperature, at the right time.</p>
<p>Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>And also pretty warm.</p>
