<p>U.S. officials presented a glossy “New Gaza” concept this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, describing a post-war rebuild featuring coastal skyscrapers and large-scale real-estate development. Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and a senior Middle East adviser, promoted the proposal as a pathway to investment-led redevelopment after roughly two years of war. The pitch arrived as fighting and civilian hardship in Gaza continue, highlighting a wide gap between long-term planning and immediate realities on the ground.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/L8zGXTuDDROR4p-S2EBVlruMGmxOwO49ljlAAfZaeho-NbkCNo3EfOSPtPxlmW3YxBUbM9tn53p3RZCB1wVZdyq9cPnPKRFAX3UFKaZ61LO52Gdgeo9IcB_P5lBY7wfMRMZhpjqQh9FjDZYxCxgDNdVfRA0AU5PN6dkNHY5sSPOHvGziTVc' alt='President Trump with other world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Slide deck details: Presentations depicted seaside resorts, residential towers, data centers, and new housing areas, including estates in the Rafah area, as part of the envisioned rebuild.</li><li>Governance vehicle: The announcement was tied to a Davos event inaugurating President Trump’s “Board of Peace,” which the New York Times reported as the ceremony where Kushner offered the plan.</li><li>Economic framing: Kushner described the enclave as offering “amazing investment opportunities,” with coverage emphasizing the plan’s emphasis on free-market, Dubai-style development and tourism.</li><li>Ongoing violence: Reporting alongside the announcement said Israeli fire killed five Palestinians, underscoring that conflict-related deaths continued as the proposal circulated.</li><li>Trump messaging: President Trump publicly linked the initiative to confidence in U.S. success in Gaza, as quoted by the BBC during the rollout.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: U.S. officials described a “New Gaza” concept centered on large-scale reconstruction, skyscrapers, housing and private investment as part of a post-war vision presented in Davos.
