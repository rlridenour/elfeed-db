Though Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; was not previously available for Puerto Rico banks, though Puerto Ricans have had access to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> and have been able to use &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; with U.S. credit and debit cards. <br/>

As of right now, Banco Popular in Puerto Rico supports &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, so Banco Popular cardholders in the territory can add eligible cards to the Wallet app to use as a contactless payment method. Banco Popular cards are able to be used at any location that accepts &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;.<br/>

Apple first launched &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; in 2014, and has expanded it to dozens of countries and territories around the world. <br/>
