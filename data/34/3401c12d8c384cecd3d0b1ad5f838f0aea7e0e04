<blockquote>
  <p>This week we <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/ollies-arcade-expansion-more-retro-games?ref=user_menu">announced a new Kickstarter</a> that’s aimed at
expanding the game offerings of Ollie’s Arcade, the fun, ad-free
retro gaming app we introduced back in 2023. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ollies-arcade/id6446127619">Ollie’s
Arcade</a> has always been a great way to escape doomscrolling,
even if just for a little while, and now we have an opportunity to
bring these retro games to even more people on iOS.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter aims to raise enough money to make all of the
in-app purchase games in the app completely <em>free for everyone</em> to
enjoy. We also want to bring our beloved puzzle game,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenzic">Frenzic</a>, to life once again. Frenzic was one of the very
first games available on iOS back in 2008, then was reborn as
<a href="https://frenzic.com/">Frenzic: Overtime</a> on Apple Arcade. Since it left, people
have been asking us for a new version that they can just pick up
and play. We couldn’t agree more!</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/03/ollies-arcade">I linked to</a> the Kickstarter for the original Ollie’s Arcade project back in 2023, which was a big success. And I <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/11/19/frenzic">first linked to Frenzic</a> all the way back in 2008, when the App Store was only a few months old. It’s just a great concept for a casual game on a small screen, implemented with all of The Iconfactory’s exquisite attention to detail. That’s true for all the games in Ollie’s Arcade, but Frenzic is special.</p>

<p>This new Kickstarter for the Ollie’s Arcade expansion has already hit its funding goal, but it’s approaching the stretch goal for an additional game. There are a zillion games for iOS, but it’s sad how few are ad-free and don’t require a subscription. If you think well-crafted fun games that you can pay for once (for a very reasonable price) should be rewarded, you should join me (<a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-iconfactory-launches-kickstarter-to-expand-ollies-arcade-with-frenzic/">and</a> <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2026/01/the-iconfactory-wants-to-bring-fun-back-to-your-fingers/">others</a>) in backing this Kickstarter.</p>
