<p>I was trying to summarize some of the things I like about Orion on macOS, but there&rsquo;s a lot I&rsquo;m still learning. All in all, it&rsquo;s growing on me. Here are some of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dark mode for individual websites is nice, especially when the rest of the windows are dark</li>
<li>Compatibility mode is a quick way to lift ad blockers and disable extensions for websites that don&rsquo;t work with those</li>
<li>Vertical tabs.
<ul>
<li>Links from the page you&rsquo;re on show under it as sub-tabs.</li>
<li>You can organize tabs into workspaces for individual projects</li>
<li>Tabs can also be auto-hidden</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extensions from Chrome and Firefox allow me extra privacy and tweaking.</li>
</ul>
