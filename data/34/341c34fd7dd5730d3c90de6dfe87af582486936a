<li>Is a flashlight and a power bank, too.</li>
<li>Refurbished (translation: less expensive)</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita? No, but did you read the bit about the brad nailer??</li>
</ul><h1>This Blows</h1><p><em>DEEP BREATH</em></p>
<p>There’s-a-reason-that-we’re-offering-this-in-a-two-pack…</p>
<p><em>BLOOOOOOOOOW</em></p>
<p>And it isn’t just that we want to get them the hell out of the warehouse twice as fast.</p>
<p><em>DEEP BREATH</em></p>
<p>Mostly-because-even-though-it’s-called-a-car-tire-inflator…</p>
<p><em>BLOOOOOOOOOW</em></p>
<p>It’s actually super great for inflating all kinds of things that aren’t car tires. Like…</p>
<p><em>DEEP BREATH</em></p>
<p>Pool-toys-and-bike-tires-and-other-weird-kid-gear-and-inflatable-pools-and-that-sort-of-thing…</p>
<p><em>BLOOOOOOOOOW</em></p>
<p>Which obviously opens up all sorts of additional uses, but also creates the possibility of a very real problem.</p>
<p><em>DEEP BREATH</em></p>
<p>Namely-that-your-car-tire-is-low-when-you’re-out-driving-and…</p>
<p><em>BLOOOOOOOOOW</em></p>
<p>…your awesome inflating device is sitting at home because that’s where you last used it to inflate your kid’s giant pink flamingo pool floatie.</p>
<p><em>DEEP BREATH</em></p>
<p>So-why-are-we-still-continuing-this-tedious-deep-breath-and-blow-bit??</p>
<p><em>BLOOOOOOOOOW</em></p>
<p>To palpably emphasize how annoying it would be to blow up that stupid flamingo without an inflator like this while also driving home the point that you really want one of these in your car and one at home just to be safe.</p>
<p>So while this thing is beefy enough to inflate a car tire, it’s also adjustable enough for a basketball or an inner tube or whatever. And believe us when we say that once you get a taste of using a proper tool to inflate miscellaneous things around the house instead of your weak and vape-addled lungs, you’ll never go back.</p>
<p>Oh! And it’s also a power bank, because of course it is. And a flashlight. And a…compressor for a brad nailer? Sure, why not. That seems like a totally reasonable use case for something like this and not at all like what your low-bid roofing contractor would figure out after having his air compressor repossessed by Harbor Freight Credit Services.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a proper piece of equipment that can get you out of all sorts of situations, from genuine emergencies to the low stakes and mundane. These are actually pretty pricy at retail, so being able to pick up two at deep refurbished discounts is kind of great.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion…</p>
<p><em>DEEP BREATH</em></p>
<p>Yes-we-needed-to-do-one-more-of-these!</p>
<p><em>BLOOOOOOOOOW</em></p>
<p>Anybody else getting woozy?</p>
