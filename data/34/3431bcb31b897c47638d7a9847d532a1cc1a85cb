Apple has announced a major Visual Intelligence update at WWDC 2025, enabling users to search and take action on anything displayed across their iPhone apps.<br/>

The feature, which previously worked only with the camera to identify real-world objects, now analyzes on-screen content. Users can ask ChatGPT questions about what they're viewing or search Google, Etsy, and other supported apps for similar items and products.<br/>
<br/>
Visual Intelligence recognizes specific objects within apps – like highlighting a lamp to find similar items online. The system also detects events on screen and suggests adding them to Calendar, automatically extracting dates, times, and locations.<br/>
<br/>
Accessing the feature appears straightforward: users press the same button combination used for screenshots. They can then choose to save or share the screenshot, or explore further with Visual Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
The update basically makes Visual Intelligence more of a universal search and action tool across the entire iPhone experience. Apple says the feature builds on Apple Intelligence's on-device processing approach, maintaining user privacy while delivering contextual assistance across apps.<br/>
