<p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://youtu.be/nAjY3e-KYms">scene in the Wallace and Gromit film</a>, &lsquo;Curse of the Were-Rabbit&rsquo; where &mdash; due to a mishap with Wallace&rsquo;s Mind Manipulation-O-Matic machine &mdash; Wallace has swapped preferences and personalities with Hutch the rabbit. While Wallace sobs, &ldquo;Oh Gromit! I don&rsquo;t want to be a giant rabbit!&rdquo;, Hutch observes, &ldquo;Aww, the bounce has gone from his bungee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s me at the moment. The bounce has definitely gone from my bungee. Only, in my case it is not due to an accident with a Mind Manipulation-O-Matic machine.</p>
<p>In my mid twenties, I started to feel exhausted all the time. Any kind of activity (mental or physical) would wipe me out, and I got pain in my joints and muscles and terrible brain fog (at the time I called likened it to trying to think through treacle). I went to the GP and had a lot of tests over a period of months, all of which ruled out a range of possible causes. After about six months of feeling no better and being tested for what felt like very disease under the sun, I got referred to a specialist in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (or ME/CFS as it now tends to be known).</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, I got diagnosed with ME/CFS and advised about how to manage my energy levels in order to try to recover. I was told that there wasn&rsquo;t any guarantee that I would be able to get back to my previous levels of activity and health, but that I should try &mdash; very gently and gradually &mdash; to increase my levels of activity, paying close attention to how I felt day to day, and resting as soon as I felt that I was going over my current capacity and energy levels. I think that the advice has changed somewhat since then, but it turned out that I was one of the very lucky ones, and that advice worked for me. It took a year or two, but eventually I got back (more or less) to &rsquo;normal&rsquo; functioning. I had to be careful: if I overdid it, or had very busy or stressful periods, I would start to feel the old symptoms again, and had to rest. However, I felt that I was successfully managing it, and didn&rsquo;t think about it most of the time.</p>
<p>Fast forward 30 or so years. In the late Summer/early Autumn of last year I started to feel completely wiped out. That wasn&rsquo;t entirely inexplicable, as I was very busy at work, but rest didn&rsquo;t help, and I was getting all the old symptoms with which I had become so grimly familiar back in my twenties. It continued to get worse, so I made an appointment with my GP, explaining the symptoms and my history with ME/CFS. Once again, I had blood tests and a range of investigations, ruling out other causes. The conclusion was that it was my old arch enemy again, and that I had effectively had either a relapse or reactivation of ME/CFS, possibly as a result of my having had both Covid and a bad bout of &lsquo;flu within the previous year. Ultimately, the cause doesn&rsquo;t really matter: it&rsquo;s back again, and I have to try to do what I did before and get back to health. However, doing that in your mid-twenties is one thing, doing it again in your mid-fifties is quite another.</p>
<p>The bounce has gone from my bungee.</p>
<p>I am obviously not alone in this position. Post-Covid, many more people are experiencing similar kinds of symptoms because of Long Covid. In 2023 the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/2february2023/previous/v1">ONS estimated</a> that there were around 2 million people in the UK who self-reported limitation on their activity levels because of Long Covid. ME/CFS has not gone away either. I&rsquo;m lucky in a way that I&rsquo;ve been here before, and have a bit of hope because I know that I was able to get into what I guess is technically remission from it last time. I&rsquo;m also very lucky that my work has been supportive, and I am in a stable enough financial situation to be able to reduce my work hours to to 80% of full-time. Having an extra rest day per week has certainly meant the difference between being able to work and not being able to work, but it is still a continual struggle.</p>
<p>On many days, I only just have the energy when I get back home to (literally) crawl up the stairs and get into bed fully clothed. I have to lie there, dozing or awake but unable to move or speak, until I have gathered back enough energy to undress and have a shower. My evenings and weekends are mostly spent recuperating. I haven&rsquo;t been able to do many of the hobbies I love (like sewing) because they take too much energy to set up or do. I take gentle walks when I can to try to keep active, I can pootle about on the computer for short periods, and I can knit for a while if I take rest breaks. I know I am incredibly lucky to be able to do even this, as many others with Long Covid or ME/CFS can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve wondered why I have written even less often on this blog than in previous years, or been less active on social media, this is why. I am, by nature, quite a hopeful and resilient person. Now that so many people are suffering from similar symptoms, I&rsquo;m hopeful that more research will uncover the causes, and develop effective treatments. The way I dealt with it before certainly doesn&rsquo;t work for everybody, and can be hugely counter-productive, causing people to swing from one &lsquo;crash&rsquo; to the next. People who are much more severely affected than me can&rsquo;t even get started with being more active without severely adverse consequences. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it now to anyone in my position, but it was all that I had back in the mid-90s. It&rsquo;s all I have for now too, so I&rsquo;ll keep trying, and try to recover some of my old bounce.</p>
