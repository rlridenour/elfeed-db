<p>Wrapping things up for the calendar year, Apple has released its final OS 26.2 updates for Mac, iPhone, and iPad.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest changes are on the iPad, which has <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/11/apples-26-2-betas-boost-ipad-multitasking-ai-processing/">added a bunch of new ways to multitask using the Dock</a>, including to create/change a Slide Over app and dragging app icons to automatically have them fill half of the screen.</p>
<p>Other new features include more customization of the time in the iOS lock screen, a new method to grant AirDrop permission via a numerical code, and a new “Edge Light” on macOS that places a white ring on your display to increase the overall brightness when you’re on a video call.</p>
