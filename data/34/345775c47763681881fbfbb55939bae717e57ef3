<p>In the latest development in the Gaza conflict, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel and Hamas are expected to move &quot;very shortly&quot; into the second phase of a U.S.-backed ceasefire plan once Hamas returns the remains of the last hostage held in Gaza. Under the first phase, Israeli forces pulled back behind a so‑called &quot;Yellow Line&quot; inside Gaza but continue to control more than half of the territory while a fragile truce and prisoner–hostage exchanges take place. The envisaged second phase focuses on disarming Hamas, demilitarising Gaza and consolidating a longer-term cessation of hostilities, though key questions remain over whether a multinational security or stabilisation force can successfully take on this role. Netanyahu plans to discuss these unresolved issues and broader arrangements for Gaza’s future, including ending Hamas rule, in a meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington later this month.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/OAwfEiDjz4tNjWGM9CsAkwOSJKjA3eD-pf-uHuBmb_2U4hLOQ6fIE_P2L5fJOgyM9ssnS1xjlqhaMjsPMXhZqYN8pR5HRqAh27GckutJhUFIM8m1NlQqF5aG_Ejn8tmaZ0BzDvKdEzH7nLYzqVLnM-8QXWL-GqbyHbQUzux_VaoUf1qMJeZls810yRPX8AgKUeFX-bXC0mJds8L5prvunchP-dgwlXFgTxxB' alt='Israeli soldiers and military vehicles near the Gaza border during the first phase of the U.S.-backed ceasefire plan.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Yellow line positions: During the first phase of the plan, Israeli troops redeployed to positions behind a designated &quot;Yellow Line&quot; within Gaza, which commanders describe as a revised front while maintaining Israeli military control over a majority of the enclave’s territory.</li><li>Disarmament debate: Netanyahu has expressed doubt that an international or multinational force could by itself disarm Hamas, saying he will nonetheless give such a force a chance before ensuring the group’s weapons are removed by other means if necessary.</li><li>Multinational force role: The U.S.-backed plan foresees a foreign-led stabilisation or security force deploying in Gaza to help maintain the truce and oversee demilitarisation, but parties have yet to agree on its composition, mandate or rules of engagement.</li><li>Hostage and prisoner swaps: The first phase has included exchanges of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza for Palestinians detained by Israel, with the recovery of the last hostage’s remains now set as the trigger for moving into the second stage.</li><li>Questions for phase two: Analysts and officials are asking whether Israel’s continued control of a large part of Gaza, ongoing Israeli strikes during the truce period, and competing expectations over Hamas’s obligations will complicate efforts to shift into a more durable cessation of fighting.</li></ul><blockquote>We are very shortly expected to move into the second phase of the ceasefire - Benjamin Netanyahu</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli government: Netanyahu has framed the coming second phase as an opportunity to end Hamas rule in Gaza while ensuring the territory is demilitarised, and has argued that Israel is &quot;stronger than ever&quot; as it considers whether to work with a multinational force on disarmament.
