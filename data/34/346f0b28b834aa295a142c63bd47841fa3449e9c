<p>A new feature in our membership CMS (<a href="https://passport.online/">Passport</a> — check it out) lets us make individual episodes of Dithering free for everyone to listen to (on the web). I can’t think of a better way to first use this new capability than to open up Friday’s episode, recapping my “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</a>” article, and the resonance with which it hit. Even the cover art — selected weeks ago — captures how I’ve felt this week.</p>

<p>Give it a listen. <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Subscribe if you enjoy it</a>.</p>
