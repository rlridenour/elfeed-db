Apple has "considered" releasing a bumper case for the upcoming iPhone 17 Air, <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1959665102313205875">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

Similar to the bumper case that Apple introduced for the iPhone 4 in 2010, Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air version of the case would cover the edges of the device, but not the back of it. Those bumper cases were made of rubber.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the iPhone 17 Air is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">expected to have an ultra-thin design</a>, customers who purchase the device might be reluctant to put it inside of a regular case, due to the added thickness. A bumper case would be a fitting compromise, as it would provide some level of protection against drops and scratches, without being overly thick.<br/>

Apple eventually ended up <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2010/07/23/apple-launches-free-iphone-4-case-program/">offering customers a free iPhone 4 bumper case</a>, due to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2010/07/16/apple-posts-video-of-iphone-4-press-conference-antenna-information-pages/">infamous "antennagate" issue</a>, which related to spotty cellular signal reception when the iPhone 4 was held in a way that covered the device's antenna bands.  <br/>

<em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma previously reported that Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">plans to release an iPhone 17 Air battery case</a>, for extra battery life on the go.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last released battery cases <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/20/apple-new-iphone-11-battery-cases/">for the iPhone 11 lineup</a>, followed by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">since-discontinued MagSafe Battery Pack</a> for iPhone 12 models and newer.<br/>
