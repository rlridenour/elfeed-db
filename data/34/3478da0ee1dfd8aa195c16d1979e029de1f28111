<p>I&rsquo;ve been on the lookout for an efficient way to swiftly scan through org headings exclusively for a specified input string, akin to the functionality of <code>isearch</code>. This would enable me to promptly navigate to a past blog post which is typically stored under an org heading.</p>
<p>By default, a standard <code>isearch</code> examines the entire file, a behaviour that in this case I don&rsquo;t really want. I specifically need to limit the search to org headings only, allowing me to swiftly navigate to an org heading.</p>
<p>The best method I have found is to use <code>consult-outline</code> which I have bound to <code>C-o</code></p>

<p>I had a play around with various org filtering options like <code>org-goto</code> and <code>org-agenda</code> but they didn&rsquo;t really quite do what I wanted.</p>
<p>As it turns out leveraging the built-in <code>outline-mode</code> through <code>consult-outline</code> also comes with the additional benefit of being applicable to source code files.</p>
<p>Also in combination with <code>embark-collect</code> it means I can create a separate outline buffer which can simply be <code>isearch</code>&rsquo;d through to refine my search further.</p>
<p>I seem to be using <code>embark-collect</code> more often these days so I bound a key to the mini-buffer map so I won&rsquo;t necessarily need to go through the embark despatching mechanism each time I want to redirect the mini-buffer contents to a proper buffer:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I have also added <code>consult-imenu</code> to my arsenal of search weapons which I have bound to <code>M-o</code>.  For example I have a very clearly defined commenting format in emacs init and sway configuration files so to jump through a file I can use <code>imenu</code> with <code>consult</code> instead.</p>
