<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve switched through a lot of different OS setups and my projects list in Spacemacs was bloated.</p>
<p>Some projects were from MacOS, others were from Windows. All of them were not existed anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to find a file where Emacs (Spacemacs) stores list of projects but I&rsquo;ve found even better elisp function
for this.</p>
<p>Just call <code>M-x projectile-cleanup-known-projects</code> and every path (project) that is not exists
on your current machine will be removed from the list of known projects.</p>

<p>Glad there is such function and my *spacemacs* buffer looks much much better now</p>
