  <p>Online tipsters have had a mixed record when it comes to providing
information about mass casualty incidents. But Rhode Island
Attorney General Peter Neronha said this Reddit user “blew the
case wide open” after posting about their encounter on Saturday

<p>“I’m being dead serious,” wrote the Reddit user, identified in an
affidavit as “John,” three days after the shootings at Brown. “The
police need to look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates,
possibly a rental.”</p>
