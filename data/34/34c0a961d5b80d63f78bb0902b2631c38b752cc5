<p>Hondurans are voting in a tightly contested presidential election framed by President Trump’s unexpected intervention from Washington, which candidates quickly turned into a central campaign issue. Leftist ruling-party candidate Rixi Moncada accused the US leader of “interventionist” meddling after he publicly endorsed her conservative rival and said he would pardon former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who is imprisoned in the United States on drug-trafficking charges. President Trump has argued that “democracy is on trial” in Honduras and presented his preferred candidate as the best option for stability and cooperation with the US, while Moncada and civil society groups warn that foreign pressure could undermine confidence in the vote. The campaign has been marred by mutual accusations of fraud and fears that whoever loses may challenge the result, but high turnout and strong engagement from election observers offer Hondurans a chance to renew their democracy through the ballot box.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/pBPHnjpvpx0jmJCD5R_0wQpTIYSQoj1mIRIVy-YK6V3ck8z6vxoiz1hbck2oBTfYZMz_BgwgCqlNXO5yrLEkIQufjiI3tkkVlquv289_mghODgywpEpQCXbKlp0OnjUMp2yXNWyjuuDc9kT9uS6S5n86I25rIUyxYcI4iFFrSw' alt='Voters in Tegucigalpa queue outside a polling station during Honduras’s closely watched presidential election.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Trump’s endorsement: President Trump issued a late endorsement of the right-wing opposition candidate, portraying them as a partner for closer security and migration cooperation with Washington, a move that Moncada’s camp says favored her rival in the campaign’s final stretch.</li><li>Pledge on ex-president: In the same message, Trump vowed to pardon former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted in a US court on drug-related charges, drawing sharp criticism from Moncada and her allies who view Hernández as emblematic of past corruption.</li><li>Fraud accusations: Both main Honduran presidential candidates have traded allegations of possible electoral fraud, heightening concerns among rights groups and analysts that narrow results could be disputed rather than swiftly accepted by the loser.</li><li>US regional posture: Analysts see Trump’s public involvement in the Honduran race as part of a broader reassertion of US influence in Latin America, especially on migration and security issues that directly affect the United States.</li><li>Observer presence: International and domestic observers have deployed across Honduras to monitor the vote-counting process, an effort aimed at bolstering transparency and public trust amid the heightened tensions around the election.</li></ul><blockquote>Democracy is on trial in Honduras. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Rixi Moncada and ruling LIBRE party: Moncada has denounced President Trump’s comments as “interventionist” and claims that backing her rival and promising a pardon for ex-president Hernández amount to meddling that disrespects Hondurans’ right to choose their own leaders.
