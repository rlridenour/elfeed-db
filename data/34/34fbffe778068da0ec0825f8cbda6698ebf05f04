The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Air is limited to USB 2 transfer speeds and it does not support faster USB 3 transfer speeds like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models. Apple also didn't update the USB port that it's using for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, so USB 3 continues to be a Pro-only feature.<br/>

With USB 2 support, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air and the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; support transfer speeds of up to 480Mb/s. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max support transfer speeds of up to 10Gb/s, like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models. <br/>
<br/>
480Mb/s is the same transfer speed that Lightning offered, so the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air and &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models are still limited to the speeds of the now-outdated Lightning technology. <br/>

Apple did not make any changes to USB-C transfer speeds this year, and it is a bit of a disappointment to see the &#36;999 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air limited to USB 2. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-air-usb-2/">iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Limited to USB 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-and-iphone-17-limited-to-usb-2.2465036/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
