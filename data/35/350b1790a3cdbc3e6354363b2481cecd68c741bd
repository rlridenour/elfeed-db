<p>Ruffin Prevost, writing at The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As everyone filed out, I repeated, in English, some of the
priest’s comments to my guide, Keiko Hatada, who taught English
for 30 years and has led custom tours of Tokyo for the past
decade. I wanted to make sure I had understood things correctly.</p>

<p>I recounted the priest’s admonition to set aside unwholesome
feelings of anger and greed, and work instead to show compassion
and generosity, as well as his reminder that his temple was still
accepting donations for those affected by the 2011 earthquake and
tsunami.</p>

<p>“You told me you didn’t speak Japanese,” my guide said, pleasantly
surprised.</p>

<p>Beyond a few basic greetings and food terms, I don’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote the following two years ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/09/airpods_pro_2_usbc">in my AirPods Pro 2 review</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new AirPods Pro are the best single expression of Apple as a
company today. Not the most important product, not the most
complicated, not the most essential. But the one that exemplifies
everything Apple is trying to do. They are simple, they are
useful, and they offer features that most people use and want.
Most people use headphones. A lot of people use them every day — in noisy environments. AirPods Pro are — for any scenario where
big over-ear-style headphones are impractical — the best
headphones in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was <em>before</em> Live Translation, a feature that until recently existed only in science fiction.</p>
