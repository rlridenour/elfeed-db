<li>They can make cold brew coffee (relatively) quickly</li>
<li>It takes 10-30 minutes depending on your desired strength (we prefer at least 30)</li>
<li>Can also mix other stuff</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: Honestly, what would happen if you put margarita ingredients into one of these?</li>
</ul><h1>Fast-ish</h1><p>Here’s what <a href="/@kdominique">@kdominique</a> said when we sold these things about a year ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have one, recently started using it regularly and loving it. Could I just make cold brew in the fridge, overnight? Sure, if I was smart enough to think that far ahead. This does a nice job in a short period of time, and now I’m buying it as gifts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the thing about cold brew coffee done the normal way. It’s not hard to do. It’s not a complicated process. It’s like marinating meat or making pizza dough. You just put a few things together and let it sit.</p>
<p>And that’s the problem, the ‘let it sit’ part.</p>
<p>You start making dinner a half-hour later than you planned, there might be a few shortcuts you can take to get that meal on the plate by the time you plan on eating. But if you forget to mix together cold brew a day early, then you have to wait a whole extra day to enjoy some iced coffee.</p>
<p>Unless you have one (or two) of these.</p>
<p>Though we should say, “rapid” here is relative. It takes a half-hour or so.</p>
<p>Oh, also, you don’t have to make coffee with it.</p>

<p>Another really good use for this is to mix protein shakes and powder add-ins like glutamine fast and smooth. Tried it today with two scoops of Fruity Pebbles Dymatize protein powder and it mixed perfectly. I have a blender but what usually happens is there’s a lot of bubbles and foam using my ninja blender so this is a nice alternative for a quick shake without the extra hassle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="/@andymand">@andymand</a>, meanwhile, chimed in with tips for the tea drinkers out there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m a (mostly herbal) tea drinker and enjoy flavorful iced tea from time to time, but I don’t enjoy the long planning that it requires: brew tea, throw it in the fridge, do other things for at least a few hours, enjoy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, I saw that I had some peach oolong tea, so I gave it a (literal) whirl in this device. I used cold water from the fridge and let it spin at full speed for about 45 minutes and the half I had was really good. I put the second half in the fridge and am drinking it today and it’s as good or better than yesterday’s.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: you get two for $12. That’s $6 each. Which is about what you pay for a grande iced Americano from Starbucks these days.</p>
<p>What we’re saying is: they’re stupid cheap. So give them a shot.</p>
<p>Or, actually, no. Shots are an espresso thing.</p>
<p>Give them a go. How about that?</p>
