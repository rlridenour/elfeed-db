<p id="p2">Wireless charging is great, but historically it&rsquo;s been slow. That&rsquo;s starting to change for the iPhone with <a href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/standards/qi-wireless-charging/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qi 2.2</a>, the latest wireless charging standard that the iPhone 16 and 17 series phones support. With Qi 2.2, a compatible iPhone charges wirelessly at 25W. By comparison Qi 1 charged at 5&ndash;7.5W and Qi 2.0 and the original MagSafe charged at 15W.</p>

<p id="p4">So far, though, there have been precious few chargers, besides <a href="https://amzn.to/4hh9hjy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s MagSafe puck charger</a>, that support Qi 2.2&rsquo;s faster charging, which is why I was interested in trying <a href="https://amzn.to/4h9hlTc" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Kuxiu X40 Turbo</a>, when Kuxiu offered to send me a review unit. As advertised, the compact 3-in-1 charger delivers the fastest wireless iPhone charging around, but that&rsquo;s not its only selling point.</p>

<p id="p6">In addition to fast charging an iPhone 16 or 17 series phone at 25W, the X40 Turbo, which retails for around $80, charges AirPods and an Apple Watch at 5W. However, what I wasn&rsquo;t expecting was just how small the X40 Turbo is when folded for travel. The entire package is about twice as thick as an iPhone 17 Pro Max and fits neatly into the palm of your hand. At the same time, though, the X40 Turbo feels sturdy. It&rsquo;s made of metal with soft-touch pads to avoid scratching your devices or tabletop. Here&rsquo;s a closer look at what Kuxiu sent me:</p>

<p id="p8">When it&rsquo;s time to charge your iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, the X40 Turbo unfolds into a z-shaped configuration from which the Watch pad flips down horizontally. So far, I&rsquo;ve used the X40 Turbo on my nightstand and at my desk, where it takes up minimal space. I also plan to take the X40 Turbo on my next trip because it takes so little room in my bag.</p>

<p id="p10">Kuxiu isn&rsquo;t the first company to make a charger in this form factor, but the X40 Turbo is one of the best built that I&rsquo;ve tried, and as one of the first Qi 2.2 models, it&rsquo;s notable, and a great upgrade to your charging setup.</p>
<p id="p11">The Kuxiu X40 Turbo <a href="https://kuxiu.co/products/kuxiu-x40-turbo-stand?ref=ppgbbyut" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available directly from Kuxiu</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/4h9hlTc" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>.</p>
