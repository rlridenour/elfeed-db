<p>As I often do, I thought it worthwhile to put up a quick post showing how I made the graphics in <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2025/09/barycentric-coordinates-and-random-distribution-of-points/">my previous post</a>. The images were made in Mathematica, mainly through the <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Graphics3D.html"><code>Graphics3D</code></a> command. The exception was the plot of 10,000 random points; that was done through <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ListPointPlot3D.html"><code>ListPointPlot3D</code></a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the notebook.</p>

<p>As typically happens, the graphics that you see in the notebook don’t match what was in the post, at least with regard to shading. That’s because the embedded notebook doesn’t evaluate the cells; it shows a kind of pre-evaluation skeleton view of the images that doesn’t account for lighting. It’s basically what I see when I first open my local copy of the notebook. I’ve reported this bug to Wolfram, and they seem to agree that it should be fixed, but my sense is that it’s not a high priority.</p>
<p>After evaluating the notebook, I right-click on the graphics cells to save the images to disk. Then I crop them, if necessary, and save them to the server.</p>
