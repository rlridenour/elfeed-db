<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I mostly use PHP or Node.js and sometimes I have to touch Ruby projects.</p>
<p>I know I can run <code>bundle install</code> to install deps from Gemfile but I was unable to find them in the project directory.</p>
<p>It turned out the reason is they are installed globally. It doesn&rsquo;t fit my needs sometimes so I had to find the way to install them locally.</p>
<p>They solution is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bundle install --path=./local-dir-name</code></li>
</ul>
<p>it will install packages into local directory but you were not be able to call binaries. Ok&hellip;</p>
<p>The solution for this is to run binaries via <code>bundle exec</code> like so:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Works perfectly.</p>
