<p>Following up on the previous item, here’s Fred Vogelstein, at Crazy Stupid Tech:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rivera says that he’s not naive about the long term, however,
“given the astonishing rate of improvement in AI capabilities
we’ve seen. So we just have to improve our own stuff. And a major
part of that will be adopting AI ourselves.”</p>

<p>Despite all this the basic approach of the original Techmeme
algorithm remains the same, he said. “What are the most linked
blog posts and news articles from this set of blogs? And once they
reach a certain threshold, they’re featured on the site,” he said.</p>

<p>Maybe there’s a lesson here for the rest of the media world. I and
every writer and mid level editor I know has stories about design
changes to publications that made us groan. They seemed more in
service of a new editor or design chief marking their territory
like a dog or cat, than in service of actually making their
publication easier to read.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I agree wholeheartedly.</p>
