Apple Intelligence has not been working for many hours today across the first developer betas of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe.<br/>

The issue has been flagged by users across the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/788946">Apple Developer Forums</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1lf99ux/ios_26_db1_apple_intelligence_uninstalled/">Reddit</a>, and other online discussion platforms throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris is <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1935848922389352816">unable to use any Apple Intelligence features</a> on iOS 26, ranging from Image Playground to Visual Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/foundation-models-framework/">new Foundation Models framework</a>, which provides developers with access to Apple's on-device large language model that powers Apple Intelligence, is also not working right now. Even the built-in ChatGPT functionality in the Xcode 26 beta is down.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, betas are pre-release software, and issues like this are to be expected. However, we wanted to bring awareness to the ongoing outage.<br/>
<br/>
While the cause of the outage is not entirely clear, <a href="https://x.com/nicolas09F9/status/1935865443249709179">developer Nicolás Alvarez said</a> that Apple made some kind of update to its Apple Intelligence backend recently, so perhaps something went wrong with that, but we are merely speculating.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, hopefully a fix is implemented soon.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> Just minutes after we published this article, the issue has been fixed.<br/>
