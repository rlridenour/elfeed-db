<p>Tim Cook, in a company-wide memo (first published by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/apple-s-cook-calls-for-deescalation-after-latest-ice-shooting">Mark Gurman</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Team, <br />
I’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and
deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities,
and with everyone that’s been affected.</p>

<p>This is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest
when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with
dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from,
and when we embrace our shared humanity. This is something Apple
has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the
president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his
openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.</p>

<p>I know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am
proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our
walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is
something I believe we all cherish.</p>

<p>Thank you for all that you do. <br />
Tim</p>

<p>“Events” is doing a lot of work there, to describe what has happened and is happening in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Trump’s “openness” on this particular “issue” has been to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/greg-bovino-demoted-minneapolis-border-patrol/685770/">replace Greg Bovino</a> — the <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/gregory-bovino-coat-border-patrol-j29xxmzmj">diminutive Himmler-cosplaying</a> “commander at large” of Border Control, who insisted, adamantly, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/bovino-border-patrol-agents-minneapolis-victims-00745702">that the real victims in Alex Pretti’s murder were the Border Patrol agents</a> who shot him — <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw1pn4lwjqo">with “border czar” Tom Homan</a>, a man who took a <a href="https://www.ms.now/news/tom-homan-cash-contracts-trump-doj-investigation-rcna232568">$50,000 cash bribe from undercover FBI agents</a> in exchange for a promise to award them government contracts if Trump were reelected.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/apollozac/status/2016346258772770826">Zac Hall, on Twitter/X</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cook took three days to not name Alex Pretti in his not public
statement and 20 days to not name Renée Good in his not public
statement. [...]</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/speaking-up-on-racism/">2020 Tim Cook on Apple’s homepage</a>: “Right now, there is a
pain deeply etched in the soul of our nation and in the hearts of
millions. To stand together, we must stand up for one another, and
recognize the fear, hurt, and outrage rightly provoked by the
senseless killing of George Floyd and a much longer history of
racism.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite the different message (and medium — this time with nothing on Apple’s website, let alone their homepage) from 2020, for what I consider far more outrageous and alarming killings.</p>
