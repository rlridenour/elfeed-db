Apple is designing an updated version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K, and rumors suggest that it could come out sometime in the next couple of months. We're not expecting a major overhaul with design changes, but even a simple chip upgrade will bring major improvements to Apple's set-top box.<br/>

We've rounded up all the latest &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; rumors.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>New A-Series Chip</strong> - The next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; is expected to get an updated A-series chip, and Apple backend code we found suggests that it'll use the A17 Pro. The A17 Pro is the chip that Apple first used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 15 Pro models, and it would bring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; for the first time. The A17 Pro is built on 3-nanometer technology and it would also bring support for console-quality games thanks to much improved CPU and GPU performance. It'll be a significant improvement over the current A15 Bionic chip.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Apple-designed Wi-Fi Chip</strong> - Apple debuted its custom N1 networking chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models, and rumors suggest that the N1 will also be used in the upcoming &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. It adds support for Wi-Fi 7, which is not a current &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; feature. With Wi-Fi 7 support, the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; will be able to connect to Wi-Fi networks that support the faster and less crowded 6GHz band. Users can expect faster Wi-Fi speeds and lower latency.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Better Siri</strong> - With a faster chip that supports &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, the next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; will support the LLM version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> that Apple plans to debut next year. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be more like Claude or ChatGPT, which could lead to better &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; recommendations, the option to use voice commands to do more than before, better support for questions about actors and music in movies and shows, and much more. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; improvements won't come until spring 2026.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>A Camera?</strong> - This is far from guaranteed and we haven't heard anything about it for quite some time, but there have been rumors suggesting that a future version of the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; could have a front-facing camera for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>. Right now, the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; requires a connected &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; calls, but if a built-in camera is added, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; wouldn't be needed. A camera could also add support for gesture-based controls.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>tvOS 26</strong> - The next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; will run tvOS 26, the latest version of tvOS that came out in September. tvOS 26 has the new Liquid Glass design, changes to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app interface, easier profile selection when logging in, Live Captions for &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;, and new aerial screensavers. There's also an option to use an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as a microphone with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Sing karaoke feature on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - There's a possibility that Apple will cut costs for the next &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, and Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has suggested that Apple is targeting a price point around &#36;100. With the A17 Pro chip and the N1 chip, Apple might not be able to hit that price with the flagship model, but there could be a lower-end entry-level option that's more affordable. Pricing right now starts at &#36;129.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Apple could release the new &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; model before the end of the year in November or December, but at this point it's also possible we won't be seeing it until early 2026.<br/>
