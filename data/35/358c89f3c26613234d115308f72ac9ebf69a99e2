<p>President Donald Trump signed a stopgap spending package that ends a four-day partial US government shutdown, reopening many federal functions and funding most agencies through the end of September (the fiscal year). The House passed the measure 217–214, with bipartisan support, clearing the immediate funding standoff. The compromise also sets up the next fight: it funds the Department of Homeland Security only for a shorter window, forcing another round of talks focused on immigration enforcement and how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is funded and overseen.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/6nt38GIZvbxWJuK_FPSGwKO-VUTmgSbPIK23n1Sw5jnkBNv5nU2TGByXnOaceqgvxKmLCYr1lWAvaKOWXjvMy0m0QgJ5sZlZ6KlIDgz8PCB_vH9ozrMgj43kB4pnEEhOwIQEl14sM8VRmhtCShY32hZxrkgtWit_c0cla-yaLi3XUheQubVrQct0FljJZWxZV5x9ensOhXlBLR77sYQXhbVzQGnFuJ38iW6JX5TaTGtaL3yiKjVH22lq_Q' alt='President Donald Trump smiles after signing a spending bill that ends a partial shutdown of the federal government, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on February 3, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Holdout meeting: President Trump met at the last minute with Republican holdouts.
