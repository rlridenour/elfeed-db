<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has quietly removed DeICER, a civic-reporting app used to
log immigration enforcement activity, from its App Store after a
law enforcement complaint — invoking a rule normally reserved for
protecting marginalized groups from hate speech.</p>

<p>According to internal correspondence reviewed by Migrant Insider,
Apple told developer Rafael Concepcion that the app violated
Guideline 1.1.1, which prohibits “defamatory, discriminatory, or
mean-spirited content” directed at “religion, race, sexual
orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted
groups.”</p>

<p>But Apple’s justification went further. “Information provided to
Apple by law enforcement shows that your app violates Guideline
1.1.1 because its purpose is to provide location information
about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such
officers individually or as a group,” the company wrote in its
removal notice.</p>

<p>The decision effectively treats federal immigration agents as a
protected class — a novel interpretation of Apple’s hate-speech
policy that shields one of the most powerful arms of government
from public scrutiny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Delicate flowers, these ICE agents are. And it’s a lie, anyway. There’s not one story about any of these apps being used to harm ICE agents. And even if such an attack happened, that wouldn’t imply it’s the <em>purpose</em> of these apps. The purpose of these apps is to protect people — citizens and non-citizens alike — <em>from ICE</em>.</p>

<p>Alas, <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-calls-ice-agents-a-vulnerable-group-removes-ice-spotting-app-red-dot/">there’s no more courage, conviction, or honesty from Google</a> on the Android side of the fence either.</p>

<p>It’d be both interesting and honest if either Apple or Google justified these app bannings by simply saying the Trump administration demanded them and that they — Apple and Google — fear reprisal from Trump if they don’t comply.</p>
