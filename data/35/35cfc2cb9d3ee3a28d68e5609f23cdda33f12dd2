<p>The United States is moving a carrier strike group and other military assets toward the Middle East in the coming days, according to U.S. officials, even as President Trump says he hopes to avoid new military action and remains open to talks with Iran. Trump described the deployment as a “big force” or “armada” heading toward Iran while saying he may not need to use it. Iranian Revolutionary Guards leadership responded with a warning that it has its “finger on the trigger” and cautioned the U.S. against “miscalculations,” as tensions remain elevated amid Iran’s recent crackdown on protests and U.S. warnings about protesters and Iran’s nuclear program.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/yY_--9nSfko_M5c55wZCnK-qgVLWQJBbrqVPn2T-CbDHGgk45ai1iniLhx6RGBzYNdnxkfQGJki1W6iqg875qn77ZipuEXzq1dfpoY76tUs5lhhdXf5VhAlrMHjH2oyA1Re2gOkoWBS7pyrbU7y9yTRwEyA-1id7xCokyaCDDIJlG1Xi_HXeENWLkKwpuU80H1K0pA_QtzYvgptuUUqwe89yrLi_T_jv4H-QZDWALRGH2lr0rM7NUN1F4w' alt='President Donald Trump reacts during a signing ceremony on his Board of Peace initiative at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on January 22, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Forces en route: U.S. officials said the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, with several destroyers and fighter aircraft, is shifting from the Asia-Pacific and is expected to reach the region soon.</li><li>Air defenses considered: One U.S. official said the administration is also looking at adding more air-defense systems as part of the posture in the region.</li><li>Protest crackdown: The deployment comes against a backdrop of months of unrest in Iran and a harsh crackdown on protests that has heightened U.S.-Iran tensions.</li><li>Claims on executions: Trump said his threat of force against Tehran had halted 837 hangings of protesters, while also reiterating he is open to talks.</li><li>Options still reviewed: Indian media reported that while the chance of immediate U.S. action appears to have receded, Trump has still been studying options as both sides say they want to give diplomacy a chance.</li></ul><blockquote>Maybe we won&#x27;t have to use it. - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US President Donald Trump: Trump said the U.S. is sending a large naval force toward the region but expressed hope he would not need to use it and said Iran still seemed interested in talks.
