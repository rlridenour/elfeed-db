Data science is the activity of creating value from data. While the mechanics of developing data products by writing code is an essential skill, data science as an activity needs to be strategic to deliver business value. This chapter develops a framework for a strategic approach to data science by creating useful, sound and aesthetic data products. Usefulness relates to a data product&#39;s ability to achieve business outcomes. A sound data product is developed using valid and reliable models, is reproducible, and, when using data about people, is ethical. Lastly, data products need to be aesthetic, not to beautify but to ensure that the outcomes of analyses are easily understood so that benefits can be realised. The book <em>Data Science for Water Utilities</em> introduces using R for water utilities through realistic case studies. <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003326977-1">The first chapter</a> introduces the principles of data science and how they relate to water management.</p>

What is Data Science?
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Data science involves analyzing data in a systematic way to create value for businesses. This field combines mathematics, computer science, and domain knowledge. Some professionals in the industry believe that individuals with expertise in all three areas are rare and often referred to as &#34;data science unicorns.&#34;</p>
<p>
As part of my Data Science Unicorn Breeding Program, I have written a book aimed at water professionals who already possess mathematical skills and domain knowledge. I want to create the elusive data science unicorns by teaching them computer science.</p>

Learning how to code
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This book uses the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R language for Statistical Computing</a>. This language is specifically designed for statistical analysis. Data science often uses other languages, such as Python, SQL, and Julia. The fact is that all data scientists need to be multi-lingual. </p>
<p>
These seven steps will help you in your journey of becoming fluent in any programming language:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://lucidmanager.org/data-science/basics-of-the-r-language/">Understand the basics</a></li>
<li>Code by hand</li>
<li>Create simple programs</li>
<li>Practice</li>
<li>Ask for help</li>
<li>Build projects</li>
<li>Help others</li>
</ol>
<p>This book introduces the basics of coding with R. Coding by hand is essential to thoroughly learning the language. Although generative AI, such as GPT or GitHub CoPilot, can write code, it will not teach you how to write code. Generative AI can assist you with finding solutions, but make sure you reverse-engineer the output so you understand the code.</p>
