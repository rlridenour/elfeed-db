<p>In the first six months of 2025, a top philosophy journal received 403 submissions. Of those, how many did it accept during that time?<span id="more-54902"></span></p>

<p>So reports <a href="https://www.journalofphilosophy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Journal of Philosophy</em></a>.</p>
<p>Here are the journal&#8217;s 2025 statistics through July 1st, as reported on its <a href="https://www.journalofphilosophy.org/memotoauthors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memo to authors</a> page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total submissions: 403</li>
<li>Desk rejections: 192; Avg # Days: 17</li>
<li>Rejections with comments: 63; Avg # Days: 77</li>

<li>Accepted: 1; # Days: 61</li>

<p>That the number of acceptances is one is striking, though I&#8217;d caution readers against jumping to conclusions about responsibility here.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE </strong>(9/9/25): I should have pointed this out in the original post, but, as some commenters have noted, the &#8220;1&#8221; looks worse than it is, since it is only about articles submitted in 2025 (and so does not include papers submitted in 2024 that were accepted for publication in 2025). I&#8217;m sorry for not doing so. In addition to adding this note, I have reworded the opening of the post. That said, as other commenters have noted, our familiarity with the &#8220;<a href="https://dailynous.com/2018/05/24/insanely-low-acceptance-rates-philosophy-journals/">insanely low acceptance rates</a>&#8221; in our discipline doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t critical questions to ask about our publishing ecosystem.</p>
