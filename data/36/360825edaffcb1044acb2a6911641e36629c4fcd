Apple is working on a 12th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and plans to update the most affordable tablet in the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup next spring. It's not going to be a major update, but if you're planning a purchase, you might want to wait for the newest model.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
There are no rumors of an updated design for the 12th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, so it will likely have the same 11-inch edge-to-edge display with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> Side Button and thick bezels.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last updated the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s design with the 10th-generation model, giving the device a more modern look to better match the designs of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
The low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is only available in a single screen size, and it is Apple's thickest tablet at 7mm. It features a Retina LED display with no ProMotion support, no P3 wide color, and no lamination (display technology that allows for improved visuals) compared to Apple's other tablets.<br/>
<br/>
Apple makes the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in several fun colors, and we could see some new shades in 2026. Current colors include blue, pink, silver, and yellow.<br/>
<br/>
No changes are expected for the rear camera, front camera, USB-C port, or compatibility with accessories like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="a-series_processor">A-Series Processor</h2><br/>
Rumors suggest the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will use Apple's A18 chip, which is the chip that Apple used for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus. It is built on a 3-nanometer process and it will offer speed and efficiency improvements over the A16 chip that's in the current model.<br/>
<br/>
The A16 chip that Apple used in 2025 does not support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, but the A18 does, so that will mark a major update for Apple's affordable tablet. The 2026 model should be able to support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that are unavailable with the 2025 model.<br/>
<br/>
The A18 also offers hardware-accelerated ray tracing and similar features for improved gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
The 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has 6GB RAM, but Apple will need to bump that up to 8GB for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="n1_chip">N1 Chip</h2><br/>
Apple debuted its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip, called the N1, in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models. The N1 was added to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it's likely that Apple plans to add the chip to all future devices coming in 2026 and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
The N1 chip supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread networking technology for smart home devices.<br/>
<br/>
The 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is limited to Wi-Fi 6, so if the 12th-generation version does indeed get Wi-Fi 7, it will be able to connect to faster 6GHz networks for the first time. Bluetooth 6 would also be an improvement over Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_modem">Apple Modem</h2><br/>
Apple has designed C1 and C1X modem chips that it has used in iPhones and iPads in 2025, and the next-generation version of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; could also get an Apple-designed modem chip for cellular models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's modem chips are more power efficient than Qualcomm chips while providing similar performance.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2><br/>
The 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;349 for 128GB of storage, and there are so far no indications that pricing is going to change for the 12th-generation model.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="launch_date">Launch Date</h2><br/>
Apple plans to release the new low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in spring 2026, which is a timeframe that spans from March 20 to June 20. The launch will likely come sometime in March or April, with Apple also set to update the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-12/">12th-Generation iPad: Release Date, Specs, and Everything We Know About Apple&#039;s 2026 Budget Tablet</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/12th-generation-ipad-release-date-specs-and-everything-we-know-about-apples-2026-budget-tablet.2471538/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
