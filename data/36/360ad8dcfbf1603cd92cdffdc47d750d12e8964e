<p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that any U.S. attack on Iran would ignite a wider “regional war,” as tensions rose after President Trump threatened military action in response to Iran’s crackdown on nationwide protests. Iranian leaders framed the recent unrest as violent “riots” and even a “coup,” while U.S. reporting described the protests as a major anti-government movement that surged amid anger over living costs and broadened into political demands. At the same time, President Trump struck a more diplomatic note publicly, saying Iran was “talking” with the United States and that he was hopeful for a deal that could avoid strikes. The reporting paints a moment where sharp warnings and military signaling coexist with active efforts—directly or through intermediaries—to find an off-ramp and prevent miscalculation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/020_0eQTJeH80dsmlG8U8sgeI3xAAQUjr4vHeUDyb7B6G0wPz2bAzLvRymLFQaLgczL1BphbkkmGJMiyXRC5J0JAr-91B9P4l8PusTp6iIWAJmuqsyZCgpcH5thKo761j3y_jbORBLiX1OKO3TrjUvvYCCOVGztNJg-V2Bll_qhfgJIeON_fb-Ij2k2YJh_HRifNUqcOPrWcFqygQAM9_49ztDa2mIA' alt='Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks in Tehran amid rising U.S.-Iran tensions.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Carrier deployment: Washington deployed a naval battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln off Iran’s shores, a step reported alongside President Trump’s warnings tied to Iran’s protest crackdown.</li><li>EU designation: Iran designated EU armies as “terrorist groups,” a move described as retaliatory as Tehran warned about broader conflict if the U.S. attacks.</li><li>Risk of errors: Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said he was worried about “miscalculations,” while also suggesting President Trump was “wise enough” to choose the right path.</li><li>Trust and mediation: Araghchi said Iran has lost trust in the United States as a negotiating partner and said some regional countries were acting as intermediaries to rebuild confidence.</li><li>Naval exercise: Iran was reported to be due to start a live-fire naval exercise in a key shipping route as the standoff intensified.</li></ul><blockquote>The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war - Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: He warned a U.S. attack would trigger a “regional war” and urged Iranians not to fear Trump’s rhetoric, while describing the protests as akin to a “coup” that was put down.
