<p>Ukraine&#x27;s prime minister Yuliia Svyrydenko announced the suspension of Justice Minister German Galushchenko on Wednesday as investigators pursue a wide-ranging probe into alleged kickbacks in the energy sector, described by authorities as a roughly $100 million scheme. Anti-corruption agencies carried out searches and have charged several people while also implicating a prominent businessman, Timur Mindich, who has been accused of orchestrating the scheme and was reported to have left the country before raids. Galushchenko — who previously served as energy minister and was reportedly subject to searches — said he agreed with the suspension and will defend himself in court, while Kyiv faces heightened scrutiny over energy contracts as the country copes with recent Russian strikes and lengthy blackouts.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qLXRDmWsweB9id1QNnlueJOozF0IsWM1MQIQ-zVEFo3Iq0jA3Afmq5pv7-MgCmQHHac9UtSgtJY-pQ3osBBVoYq_voyoiZQr0k0ufUueXSfW5m0Uw79Yq_OiBqNgxvZ2GnZnX_yC2Sa4OtFdgqbhYkTFBl-cl5LdlviXUZL3IoQzNnZ2hj7HNFJ1WCUDKYehVQwJKwQ8b7j69IaunyFcdERFfxTuVqw8U2MX66UB4Y0emb2jCPOTl84FWIJbT7PMlaTND0q1UdODVXw' alt='Accusations of corruption in the energy sector are particularly sensitive with the Ukrainian public as they face lengthy daily blackouts.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Disputed sums: News outlets report differing totals for the graft: many cite about $100 million, while at least one report put the alleged scheme at roughly $140 million after investigators&#x27; inquiries.</li><li>Long investigation: Authorities say the operation follows a prolonged probe lasting about 15 months, culminating in coordinated raids across energy-related offices and homes.</li><li>Who else is implicated: Prosecutors and NABU have implicated a close Zelensky ally, Timur Mindich, and named a figure nicknamed &#x27;Che Guevara&#x27; along with intermediaries alleged to have moved illicit transfers exceeding $1.2 million in traced cash flows.</li><li>Political pressure: Observers warn the scandal risks eroding public trust and comes at a sensitive time as Kyiv seeks continued Western financial support and progress toward EU integration.</li></ul><blockquote>I believe that the suspension for the time of investigation is a civilized and correct scenario.
