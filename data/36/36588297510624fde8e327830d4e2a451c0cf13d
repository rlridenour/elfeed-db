<p>I&rsquo;m a FreeBSD guy. My first computer was a FreeBSD machine that my dad had running in a closet. I learned how to use Emacs as well as the command line on that black-screen white-text no-mouse interface. That&rsquo;s how real programmers spend their childhood! 😎 😜</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only heard good things about FreeBSD. While not known as particularly desktop-friendly (various Linux distros win here) I&rsquo;ve heard tales of its rock-solid stability. I wanted to try running on FreeBSD again, just to see what all the fuss was about.</p>

<p>Installing was relatively straight forward. I followed the instructions
<a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/action/show/arm/Raspberry%20Pi?action=show&amp;redirect=FreeBSD%2Farm%2FRaspberry&#43;Pi">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once I got the card flashed (took about an hour) and booted, I reset the
passwords for users <code>root</code> and <code>freebsd</code>. Note that at time of writing
WiFi wasn&rsquo;t supported; I had to hard-link an Ethernet cable. It found
the connection without any trouble, so that was nice.</p>

<p>The clock is necessary to start working with the ports. Set the config

rebooting, but I think I did things out of order.)</p>

<p>I tried going into <code>/usr/ports/editors/emacs/</code> and running
<code>make install</code>, but I must have had an option wrong because it tried
installing&hellip; I think the entire X Windowing System. Yikes.</p>
<p>I gave up after about a day and instead ran <code>pkg install emacs-nox</code> and
<code>pkg install git</code>; those ran pretty quickly.</p>
