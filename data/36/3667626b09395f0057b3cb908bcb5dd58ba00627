<p>Ookla, the company behind the Speedtest download/upload bandwidth testing app:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although it’s early in the adoption curve for the iPhone 16e, we
analyzed the performance of the new device from March 1st through
March 12th, and compared it to the performance of iPhone 16, which
has a similar design and the same 6.1” screen. Both devices run on
the same Apple-designed A18 SoC.</p>

<p>When we compare Speedtest Intelligence data from the top 90th
percentile (those with the highest performance experience) of
iPhone 16e and iPhone 16 users from all three of the top U.S.
operators, we see the iPhone 16 performing better in download
speeds. However, at the opposite end, with the 10th percentile of
users (those who experience the lowest performance) we see the
iPhone 16e performing better than the iPhone 16.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are some differences, but overall the 16e’s cellular performance seems great for the frequencies it supports. And given the efficiency claims from Apple, it might be the better overall modem. (I also think the frequencies it <em>doesn’t</em> support don’t really matter all that much in real-world practice. If you know that you really make use of the crazy-high speeds of mmWave from Verizon, then you know the C1 modem is not for you.)</p>
