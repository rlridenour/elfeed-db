<h2>Background Security Improvement</h2><br/>
Apple appears to have changed the name of Rapid Security Updates to Background Security Improvement, which is mentioned in the iOS 26.1 code.<br/>
<br/>
"Background Security Improvement improves the security of your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> by installing security improvements and system files before they are available in iOS Software Updates. In rare instances of compatibility issues, these deliveries may be temporarily removed and then improved in a feature software update."<br/>
