<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A quick post laying the ground work for a &ldquo;From MacOS to Linux&rdquo; blog post series.
</p>
        <p>In between my day job, gardening, gathering with friends, unpacking, and playing
with my dogs, I’ve been migrating my non-work computering to <span><a href="https://linux.org/">Linux</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Linux”" title="Other site-wide references of “Linux”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-LINUX">&#128214;</a></small>
.  This post
is my first post written and published on that <span>Linux</span>
 machine.</p>
<p>I’ll be following up on this preliminary post with more posts, extracted from
the notes I took on my migration.</p>
<p>For now, the purpose of this post is to test that I can publish from the <span>Linux</span>

machine.</p>
