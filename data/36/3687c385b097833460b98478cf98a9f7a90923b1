<blockquote>
  <p>Moltbot was formerly known as Clawdbot. Independent project, not
affiliated with Anthropic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makes sense, to be honest, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/clawdbot-changes-name-moltbot-anthropic-trademark-2026-1">that Anthropic would object</a> to naming it a homonym for Claude.</p>

<p>One additional followup to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/26/viticci-on-clawdbot">my post the other day</a>. In his terrific introduction to <s>Clawd</s>Moltbot, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/clawdbot-showed-me-what-the-future-of-personal-ai-assistants-looks-like/">Federico Viticci wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been playing around with Clawdbot so much, I’ve burned
through 180 million tokens on the Anthropic API (<em>yikes</em>), and
I’ve had fewer and fewer conversations with the “regular” Claude
and ChatGPT apps in the process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those tokens aren’t free. I asked Viticci just how much “yikes” cost, and <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@viticci/115968901926545907">he said</a> around US$560 — using way more input than output tokens.</p>
