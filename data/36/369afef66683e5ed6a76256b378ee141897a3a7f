<p>Ukraine’s partners meeting in Paris agreed on a framework of “robust” security guarantees intended to deter any renewed Russian attack once a ceasefire or peace deal is reached. Leaders said the package would pair a European multinational force deployed in Ukraine after a ceasefire with U.S.-led monitoring of the truce, signaling an effort to make any future settlement more durable. The talks underscored both coordination among Kyiv’s allies and the reality that a deal remains uncertain, with Russia described as holding to its demands and with lingering questions in Europe about how far U.S. backing would go in writing.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/BTETbjB1SmvNJYX12YLxNk_GjuV5wFkHjSjBX80YU3Q98U7g7GoJxM1ODRFVTEcGbSexO6Ajtb1xg9k7Oup2ibCGAkUeA98mt0hG9PwzaQND2uaEpGHCtOVWjPnWMqMX1akg_gI4niShrZlH_PpD3SPCnPBWFoYZYKrAcVR2L35lQU073oPzWI5zdlHhfbxdAo2ElJE1Rb4V9WuwNArzXfet9CkaA8yzgD6964ArrgTc1g56tEZx2xHF3g' alt='Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, left, France&#x27;s President Emmanuel Macron and Britain&#x27;s Prime Minister Keir Starmer shake hands after the signing of the declaration on deploying post-ceasefire force in Ukraine during the &#x27;Coalition of the Willing&#x27; summit on security guarantees for Ukraine, at the Elysée Palace in Paris, Tuesday, January 6, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Troop concept: The UK and France signed a declaration of intent with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that foresees British, French and other European troops deploying on Ukrainian territory after a ceasefire.</li><li>US role debated: European officials had hoped for an explicit U.S. “backstop” written into a joint statement, but the final declaration was signed only by the Europe-led “coalition of the willing,” feeding concerns about U.S. reliability even as American envoys offered supportive remarks in Paris.</li><li>Ceasefire monitoring: French officials said Washington would lead a mechanism to monitor any truce, with U.S. support envisioned if a European force faced a renewed Russian attack.</li><li>Russia’s stance: Russia has said it would reject any settlement that allows forces from NATO countries to be stationed in Ukraine, posing a clear hurdle for the post-ceasefire force proposal.</li><li>Focus on territory: U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff described territorial questions as the most critical issue and said compromises would be needed, while Zelenskyy noted talks with the U.S. included “some ideas” on territory.</li></ul><blockquote>This is important so that when this war ends, it ends forever - Steve Witkoff</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>France (President Emmanuel Macron): Macron presented the declaration as an “operational convergence” among allies and argued that security guarantees are essential so a peace deal does not become “Ukrainian surrender” or invite future Russian threats.
