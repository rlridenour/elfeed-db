The acquisition, spotted by <em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/11/faster-more-flexible-databases-could-be-coming-to-filemaker-or-iwork">AppleInsider</a></em>, was completed in October 2025 for an undisclosed sum. The company's website was subsequently taken down and its Github repository was archived, as is commonplace for Apple acquisitions.<br/>
<br/>
Kuzu was "an embedded graph database built for query speed, scalability, and easy of use." It offered Kuzu Explorer, a browser-based database that displayed datapoints as linked nodes. Apple had to <a href="https://digital-markets-act-cases.ec.europa.eu/acquisitions">inform the European Union</a> of the acquisition owing to its significance, but there are few other details around it. <br/>
<br/>
Apple already owns FileMaker, a cross-platform relational database app, via a subsidiary. It is unclear what Apple plans to use Kuzu's technology for. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-acquisition/">Apple Acquisition</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/apple-acquires-new-database-app/">Apple Acquires New Database App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-acquires-new-database-app.2477530/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
