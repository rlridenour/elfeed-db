</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Considering the great utility of procedures and tables as a means of developing the fictive world, passing from potential to actual.
</p>
        <p>I’ve been playing a solo game of <cite><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514996/mythic-bastionland?affiliate_id=318171">Mythic Bastionland</a></cite> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Mythic Bastionland”" title="Other site-wide references of “Mythic Bastionland”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-MYTHIC-BASTIONLAND">&#128214;</a></small>
, tracking the story in my
Forged from the Worst series.  This morning <a href="https://gnomestones.substack.com/p/ep-4-gnomereign-mythic-bastionland">Ep 4: Mythic Bastionland Solo
Campaign</a> rolled through my feed.</p>
<p>And I noted they were using different procedures.  Which lead me to <a href="https://gnomestones.substack.com/p/tension-tables-and-faction-development">Tension
Tables and Faction Development in Mythic Bastionland</a>.  Very interesting and I
can see cribbing that encounter table procedure.</p>
<p>In one of the comments, Jack Edward wrote:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

It&rsquo;s funny, I&rsquo;m always curious about how to work other kinds of play into Mythic
Bastionland — particularly other themes and dimensions of play — just reworking
the random encounter table to include more stuff is one of the most elegant ways
I&rsquo;ve seen of doing it!

</blockquote>

<p>And this is something to poke at more.  At the end of <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/12/20/forged-from-the-worst-session-5/">Forged From the Worst:
Session 5</a>, Sir Beatrice learned of The Lich.  I the referee and you the reader,
had known that the Lich was likely going to enter into the fiction.  Yet, as the
player of Sir Beatrice, it was news to me.</p>
<p>The fiction is what happens at the table: revealed random encounters, actions
taken, words spoken, tests passed and failed etc.  The potential is the random
encounter tables, rumor tables, morale checks, reaction rolls, and backstory.
And we use procedures, implicit and explicit, to transform potential into
actual.</p>
<p>In that moment between potential and actual, we gain glimpses.  When a referee
and player negotiate task, intent, and the consequences of success and failure,
the game enters a liminal space.  There is visibility into the potentiality of
something that will not occur (the failure consequences when the test succeeds).</p>
<p>Likewise, when a player has visibility into the random tables (and procedures
for using them) they have access to more than what is…they know what can be.</p>
<h2 id="swapping-procedures">Swapping Procedures</h2>
<p>At a few sessions into <cite>Mythic Bastionland</cite>
, I’m looking at the Gnomestones’s
random event table.  The table and procedures mean that their game will involve
more consideration for weather and factions.</p>
<p>I find the ability to swap out subsystems a compelling reason for these analogue
games.  And as these procedures are performed “by hand” there’s an incentive for
them to be concise.  Which helps in their portability.</p>
<p>Don’t like that your players are always escalating to combat?  Introduce the
Reaction Roll?  See that the players are always leaning into the Reaction Roll
because of high charisma?  Require that in order to gain the Charisma bonus the
first action of the encounter must be Parlay; which might leave them
ill-prepared for an attack.</p>
<p>I think it is important that you shouldn’t significantly change procedures
between sessions…unless an Age has passed.  As in, if you are fast forwarding to
a time in which world events would change, consider the swap out.</p>
<p>Thinking of Mythic Bastionland, how might we start shifting towards the “Into
the Odd” era (if we wanted to)?  What procedures might change?  How might I
alter my random tables or procedures to move in that direction?</p>
<p>Or how might I give more focus to the Factions?  I’ve created the lever in the
procedures for entering a Holding, and when the current Age ends, perhaps I’ll
adjust the procedures to reflect the game I’m seeing or wishing to further
explore.</p>
<h2 id="building-forged-from-the-worst">Building Forged from the Worst</h2>
<p>These days, I eschew writing back story, instead spending time having that
emerge in play.  I might seed situations, but most often that’s through random
procedures.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://takeonrules.com/series/forged-from-the-worst">Forged from the Worst</a> I did spend time rolling up relationships and
conflicts, but only in service of seeding an Escalation Table for one of the
relationships.  And I’m doing that in a just in time manner.</p>
<p>Below is the relationship graph.  It’s one where I’ve thought a bit about each
relationship, marveling at some of those random rolls and how they compounded on
each other.  But only the Escalation Table for the relationship between Prentise
and Yelena carries any fictive reality; in that I’ve now once rolled on it.</p>

<p>Further, in solo-play it seems absurd to spend much time on back story.  If I’m
doing that, I might as well write a novel.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I first started playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons in Second Edition era.  It was a time
when backstory and story plot became vogue.  Amongst my local gaming groups, and
those that ran games, I remember derision towards random encounters —
self-included.  Yet now, I consider much of this required for the types of games
I’ll enjoy running.</p>
<p>First, when I’m running a game, I too want to experience surprise and wonder.
With procedures generating random situations, I’m surprised first in the
situation I present and then in the response of the players.  Which I find far
more enjoyable than presenting the next plot point then being surprised by the
player responses.</p>
