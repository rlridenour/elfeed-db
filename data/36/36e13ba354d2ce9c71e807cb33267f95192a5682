<p>Ryan Wedding, a former Canadian Olympic snowboarder, was arrested in Mexico after years as a fugitive and is now in U.S. custody, according to multiple outlets. U.S. prosecutors accuse Wedding, 44, of running a transnational cocaine-trafficking operation and link him to killings, including the alleged murder of a federal witness, charges he will have a chance to contest in court. Authorities say he turned himself in at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Mexico City and is expected to appear in court in California, a development officials framed as a win for cross-border cooperation against organized crime.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/HpIMnCj1Fw6UQQHcg0y-FhqJG5twq5pTDRnUvdA0QjYveQ00rMqwzmOhjsI3XKRAY3zWsLEaL-rdMZO_k_GUo2BwnD4JIXEwZV2BnhbaneJ8HT_K1UqUcw-aW7KiqPlrRKD8oHcuf0Uj8TUJPq1GBJBj6yAcA4sUmlQZ0_w3BugYBVSDOsvJzRLuwTe15TMRYFJO7EfP' alt='Ryan Wedding, a former Olympic snowboarder, has been charged with smuggling cocaine into the United States and with murder.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Court next steps: Wedding is due to make a court appearance in California on Monday, The Guardian reported, as U.S. proceedings begin following his transfer from Mexico.</li><li>Most wanted status: The BBC reported he had been on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, underscoring how high a priority the case was for U.S. authorities.</li><li>Scale alleged: Al Jazeera said prosecutors describe the alleged trafficking scheme as multibillion-dollar in scope, reflecting the scale authorities attribute to the network.</li><li>Officials’ framing: The Guardian quoted U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi calling the alleged organization “one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations” in the world.</li><li>Athletic past: El País highlighted Wedding’s early prominence as an Olympic athlete before the allegations, describing a dramatic personal trajectory now headed into the justice system.</li></ul><blockquote>One of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations - Pam Bondi</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. Justice Department: Officials say Wedding faces serious U.S. charges tied to cocaine trafficking and multiple killings, and they announced his arrest and transfer into U.S. custody.
