<p>I recently made an update to how I build my blog. I like writing my posts with Org-mode because it provides a richer markup language than Markdown. Plus, more Emacs = more good. <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> has support for Org files, but there was a problem with the RSS feed generation: all of my posts written in Org got truncated at some point. I don&rsquo;t know if the fault lies with Hugo itself or with some problem in the theme I use—whatever it was, I don&rsquo;t have the time right now to debug that and submit a good bug report or a fix. Instead, I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">ox-hugo</a> org-mode exporter, so I still can write my posts with Org, but then let Emacs export them to Markdown for Hugo to process.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a Rube Goldberg machine. But what would a programmer&rsquo;s blog be if the build wasn&rsquo;t convoluted like this? Anyway, RSS feeds are fixed now—I checked. If you happened to read anything only via RSS, and found the content cut off at a strange point, this might have fixed it for some posts. Let me know if you run into any other strange issues.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
