<p>
Pedro pointed out that I had some incomplete clock
entries in my Emacs configuration.
<a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Resolving-idle-time.html">org-resolve-clocks</a> prompts you for what to do
with each open clock entry in your Org agenda
files and whatever Org Mode files you have open.
</p>

<p>
If you don't feel like cancelling each clock with
<code>C</code>, I also wrote this function to delete all open
clocks in the current file.

<div class="org-src-container">
