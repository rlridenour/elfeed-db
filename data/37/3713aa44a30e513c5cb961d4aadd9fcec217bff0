<p>In my previous post about creating simple functions to create a new directory and file in <code>dired</code>, I received an interesting comment suggesting another way to bypass the potential messiness of completion and pass through the literal text input.</p>

<p>My last post :</p>

<p>It is a subtlety of most if not all completion systems, and that is to exit with any input, hence exiting without having to necessarily match and complete.</p>
<p>Given this, and given that I&rsquo;m using the completion framework of <code>vertico</code>, I thought I would revisit the vertico github manual : <a href="https://github.com/minad/vertico">https://github.com/minad/vertico</a></p>
<p>and I find :</p>
<p><strong>M-RET -&gt; vertico-exit-input</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>vertico-exit-input exits with the minibuffer input instead. Exiting with the current input is needed when you want to create a new buffer or a new file with find-file or switch-to-buffer. As an alternative to pressing M-RET, move the selection up to the input prompt by pressing the up arrow key and then press RET.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well this is exactly the issue I was having and why I wrote my two little simple functions.  Now if I build in M-RET into my muscle memory (which already seems pretty natural), I can refine my Emacs init, while adhering more to vanilla Emacs concepts.  Also as I now am being more idiomatic, I suspect the M-RET keybinding may just come in handy at some point in the future.</p>
<p>So, now rebinding <code>dired-mode-map</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;_&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">.</span> dired-create-empty-file)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is all that is required; note that <code>dired-create-directory</code> is already bound to my preferred keybinding.</p>
<p>So continues the evolution of my Emacs understanding!</p>
<p>As a side-ish note, I have found that writing this blog provides not only an opportunity to explore a topic further and thoroughly understand it, thereby enabling me to articulate the subject fully, but also to receive comments and discover subtle nuances that I hadn&rsquo;t realized existed or hadn&rsquo;t thought to explore!</p>
