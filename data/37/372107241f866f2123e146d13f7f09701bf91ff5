With the iOS 18.6 update, Apple may <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-6-ios-19/">bring Apple Intelligence to China</a> for the first time. Apple is expected to partner with Alibaba and Baidu for AI features in the country, but it is not clear if this has been delayed because Apple is facing regulatory hurdles in China.<br/>
