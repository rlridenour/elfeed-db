The feature enables unlocking, locking, and starting the vehicle using an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or Apple Watch via NFC, Bluetooth Low Energy, and Ultra Wideband. Digital Keys stored in Apple Wallet will continue to function even when an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has run out of charge. Owners will be able to share access with up to seven additional users.<br/>

Porsche was highlighted as an <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-macan-model-year-change-comfort-assistence-entertainment-40360.html">upcoming partner</a> when Apple outlined next-generation Car Key support at WWDC. Porsche Digital Key support will be available on 2026 model year versions of the <a href="https://www.porsche.com/usa/porsche-connect/digital-key/#FAQ-and-Support">electric Cayenne and Macan</a> as part of the Comfort Access option. <br/>

Earlier this week, Samsung <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-wallet-enhances-vehicle-connectivity-with-porsche-digital-key-integration">announced</a> that its Samsung Wallet service now supports Porsche Digital Key access for select models beginning with the 2026 Macan, using similar standards.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/carkey/">iPhone Car Keys</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/porsche/">Porsche</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/porsche-digital-key-support-to-cayenne-and-macan/">Porsche Bringing Apple Digital Key Support to 2026 Cayenne and Macan</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/porsche-bringing-apple-digital-key-support-to-2026-cayenne-and-macan.2474526/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
