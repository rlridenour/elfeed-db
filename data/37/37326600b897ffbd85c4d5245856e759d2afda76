<p>At the bottom of Apple’s press release announcing that <em>F1 The Movie</em> will be available for streaming on December 12:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity.
Ahead of its global streaming debut on Apple TV, the film
continues to be available for purchase on participating digital
platforms, including the Apple TV app, Amazon Prime Video,
Fandango at Home and more.</p>

<p><strong>About Apple TV</strong></p>

<p>Apple TV is available on the Apple TV app in over 100 countries
and regions, on over 1 billion screens, including iPhone, iPad,
Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, Mac, popular smart TVs from Samsung,
LG, Sony, VIZIO, TCL and others, Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices,
Chromecast with Google TV, PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles,
and at tv.apple.com, for $12.99 per month with a seven-day free
trial for new subscribers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In some ways, I get it. Like, if you’re telling someone how much you enjoy <em>Slow Horses</em> and they ask how to watch it, it’s more natural and conversational to just say “It’s on Apple TV”. That’s what most people say. That’s what I say — and as part of my job, I completely understand the difference between Apple TV the device, Apple TV the (free) app, and Apple TV+ the (paid) streaming service.</p>

<p>But right there in Apple’s own “About Apple TV” description, you see just how overused “Apple TV” now is. You can watch Apple TV in Apple TV on Apple TV — the paid service in the free app on the set-top box. But you can watch any streaming service you want on the box, in that service’s own app. But many of those services are also available in the Apple TV app. And the Apple TV streaming service is also available on just about all other popular set-top hardware platforms. So you don’t need an Apple TV to watch Apple TV. It’s a bit like Abbott and Costello’s classic “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYOUFGfK4bU">Who’s on First</a>” routine.</p>
