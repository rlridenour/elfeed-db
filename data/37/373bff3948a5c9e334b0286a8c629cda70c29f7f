<p>President Trump’s overnight flight from the Washington, DC area to Switzerland for the World Economic Forum turned back soon after takeoff because the crew identified what the White House called a “minor electrical issue”. Journalists traveling with the president reported that lights in the press cabin briefly went out after departure. The aircraft returned to Joint Base Andrews, and the president continued the trip on another plane—ultimately arriving in Davos as planned. The interruption comes as Trump prepares to meet global political and business leaders amid strained U.S.-Europe relations, including a heated debate over Greenland’s ownership mentioned across coverage.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PhotgJAFg-ZlqpdgR3uj2Z6Taw3dIyWwKk-gN7t7k9fBi0uCzYwSKY8kC4BVkE137eCRvJPAObL7ghcMlDf8fMXQHM9JeCqGtykvhBKr-QvT' alt='A view of the plane set to carry President Trump to Switzerland after Air Force One returned to Joint Base Andrews on Jan. 20, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Caution protocol: Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the plane returned “out of an abundance of caution,” with Air Force One landing at Joint Base Andrews shortly after 0400 GMT.</li><li>Second departure: After switching aircraft at Andrews, Trump’s party took off again shortly after 0500 GMT—about two-and-a-half hours after the first departure, according to the report.</li><li>WEF schedule: Trump is scheduled to address the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday afternoon, per the White House statement cited in coverage.</li><li>Aircraft concerns: The current Air Force One fleet consists of two highly customized Boeing 747-200B aircraft that entered service in 1990, and Trump has previously complained about delays in the delivery of new 747-8 replacements.</li><li>Greenland tensions: RT reported Trump plans to discuss acquiring Greenland from Denmark and has threatened new tariffs on multiple European countries unless a deal is reached, while EU officials have discussed possible retaliation measures.</li></ul><blockquote>After takeoff, the AF1 crew identified a minor electrical issue.
