<p>Regarding my earlier post on similarities between the 2010 App Store Guidelines and today’s: Notably absent from the current guidelines (I think for a very long time) is the specious but very Jobsian claim that “If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps.” Getting the press on your side is one of the <em>best</em> ways for a developer to get an unjust App Store review decision overturned. Apple <em>loathes</em> negative publicity.</p>
