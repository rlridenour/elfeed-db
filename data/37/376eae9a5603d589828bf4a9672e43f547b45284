<p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a tense House Judiciary Committee hearing over the Justice Department’s handling of investigative files tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Lawmakers from both parties pressed Bondi over redactions and the pace of disclosure. Democrats argued the department is holding back information, while Republicans said the release still falls short of what Congress required. One flashpoint came after Reps. Ro Khanna (Democrat) and Thomas Massie (Republican) said they reviewed unredacted material at the Justice Department. They then publicly named six previously redacted people they described as “powerful” men, while stressing the documents do not, on their face, allege specific criminal wrongdoing by those individuals. Bondi defended the department’s work, saying it had limited time to review, redact, and unredact millions of pages. She also apologized to Epstein’s victims during the hearing, according to multiple accounts.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/aF0LfLuK6CC49MYEfLxImi_GrW7lOqNj_C_2AHAYpcSlAPwOZ2ClQTBJCUCmeyyqawXO2gIPBee29Q9DRbABYpQjtD_MkzAIYVCwv0ps' alt='Rep.
