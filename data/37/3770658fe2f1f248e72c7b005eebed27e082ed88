<h2>A happy Journelly user</h2>
<p>Just as I'm getting ready to announce Journelly's 1.1 release, <a href="https://ellanew.com/about">Ellane</a> (from <a href="https://ellanew.com">ellanew.com</a>) shared a wonderful blog post on her experience using version 1.0:</p>
<p><a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/157-2025-05-19-journelly-is-org-for-those-who-dont-do-org">Journelly is the Org App You’ll Love (Even if You Don’t Do Org)</a>.</p>
<p>I'm particulary excited to hear from Ellane given her <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl">Plain Text; Paper, Less</a> philosophy.</p>
<center>
<small>
<p>"It’s the perfect mix of simplicity and low-tech plain text wizardry"</p>
<p>"It takes a very particular set of features for a new app to impress me enough to hit the purchase button as fast as I did with Journelly."</p>
<p>"Journelly is the first Org-powered app I’ve seen that lays out the welcome mat for people who don’t even know what Org is, never mind how to use it."</p>

<p>As an <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org mode</a> enthusiast myself, I'm delighted to hear Journelly is paving a gentle road for org newcomers.</p>
<p>Ellane's post also has a great list of features requests. Lucky for me, I can report at least two of them are covered by today's release:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new hashtag picker.</li>
<li>Pasting images from the clipboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to check out <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/157-2025-05-19-journelly-is-org-for-those-who-dont-do-org">Ellane's post</a>, as she covers many details I'm not mentioning here. But lemme share one last tip I learned from her post today…</p>
<h2>Ellane's iCloud tip</h2>
<p>Today I learned something new from Ellane’s <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/157-2025-05-19-journelly-is-org-for-those-who-dont-do-org">post</a>: you can Control-click the Journelly iCloud Drive folder on your Mac and select &quot;Keep Downloaded&quot; to ensure your notes are always available offline. Super handy, specially for those of us using Emacs on macOS.</p>
<h2>Markdown enthusiast? Enquire within</h2>
