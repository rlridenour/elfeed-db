<blockquote>
  <p>As President Donald Trump’s enormous new tariffs on China rippled
through global supply chains, Apple CEO Tim Cook went to work
behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Cook spoke to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week about
the potential impact of the tariffs on iPhone prices, two people
familiar with the phone call said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity to reflect private conversations that were previously
unreported. Cook spoke with other senior officials in the White
House, the people said. And he refrained from publicly criticizing
the president or his policies on national television, as many
other executives have over the past several weeks.</p>

<p>By the end of the week, the Trump administration agreed to exempt
from import duties electronic products that Apple produces in
China, an action that also granted a reprieve to other large U.S.
firms, including HP and Dell. Trump did so despite the
recommendations of senior White House aide Peter Navarro, who had
wanted the taxes to remain in place, the people said.</p>

<p>Three points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Tim Cook manages this dance with aplomb. This is not a “good system”. But given the way Trump operates, what Cook managed here is not merely good for Apple but better policy, period.</p></li>
<li><p>Howard Lutnick is a lickspittle moron with the demeanor of a used car salesman who knowingly sells overpriced lemons to suckers. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644320/us-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-says-well-be-making-iphones-in-the-us">Here he is on Meet the Press a few weeks ago</a> bragging that “The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones — that kind of thing is going to come to America.” Keith Olbermann mentioned in a recent episode of his podcast that Lutnick is a dead ringer for Morrie Kessler, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UNC4nvo4Wo">the bookmaker of “Morrie’s Wigs” fame</a> from <em>Goodfellas</em>, and I can’t un-see it.</p></li>
<li><p>Peter Navarro is <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/killer-klown-khaos">such a profound dope</a> and abject fraud — seriously, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/18/771396016/white-house-adviser-peter-navarro-calls-fictional-alter-ego-an-inside-joke">he’s not even good at making up phony names</a> — that he makes Lutnick seem like a credible, responsible official.</p></li>
