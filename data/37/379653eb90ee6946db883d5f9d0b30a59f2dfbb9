Apple tweaked the design of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a>, changing the fit of the tips in the ears and bringing some updates to the case. On the whole, the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; look a lot like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, but there are some differences to be aware of.<br/>

<h2>Earbud Design</h2><br/>
Apple reengineered the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; using more than 10,000 ear scans and more than 100,000 hours of user research.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says internal architecture was revamped to make each AirPod slightly smaller, and the external geometry of the ear tip was aligned to the center of the body to improve stability. Basically, the ear tips are now rotated inward.<br/>

The shape is meant to better fit into the ear canal, improving sound isolation and ensuring that the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; stay in place during workouts.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to actual size, there are a couple changes. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; are the same height as the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2, so the stem isn't any shorter. Width is now 19.2mm, down from 21.8mm, so they're a little bit slimmer. They're also deeper, though, measuring 27mm, up from 24mm. Weight increased too, so the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; are 5.55 grams, while the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 were 5.3 grams.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Charging Case</h2><br/>
There were rumors that Apple would slim down the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; Charging Case, like it did with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> Charging Case last year.<br/>
<br/>
That didn't happen. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; Charging Case is actually larger than before. It measures in at 1.86 inches tall (up from 1.78 inches), 2.45 inches wide (up from 2.39 inches), and 0.86 inches deep (up from 0.85 inches). It's not as heavy, weighing 1.55 ounces, down from 1.79 ounces.<br/>

The case for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; has an attachment point for a lanyard, along with a capacitive pairing button and an invisible LED that only shows up when the case is opened or charging. <br/>
<br/>
Battery life for the earbuds themselves is up, but the charging case doesn't last as long. Apple says it provides up to 24 hours of charging time, but the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 case provided up to 30 hours of listening time. <br/>

You can pre-order the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; now, and the earbuds will launch on September 19.
