  <p>Now Threads feels rather lifeless. While users still post there,
for many it has become something of a second-tier platform — a place
that they dump content out of habit, not because they’re having
real conversations or finding meaningful engagement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I believe Meta that there are hundreds of millions of people
signing on every month, but they seem to be doing absolutely
nothing there. More interesting stuff is on Bluesky and Mastodon,
and better conversation happens on those platforms as well.</p>

<p>I feel the same way. Threads has dropped to a decided #3 for me after Mastodon and Bluesky, and (a) I don’t really have room in my head or time in my day for 3 of these platforms, and (b) I’m more than OK with Meta’s entry falling by the wayside.</p>

<p>Like, if the answer at the moment for Twitter-style social media is Bluesky (general audience) and Mastodon (nerds), that’s ... the best outcome? Even X (chaos and Musk sycophancy) seems to have a better, more defined vision for what it’s supposed to be than Threads.</p>
