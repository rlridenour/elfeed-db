</ul><h1>Good Looks, Good Taste</h1><p>When we sold this in August of last year, <a href="/@heidit24">@heidit24</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oops I cracked a bottle yesterday and it was amazing, please offer this deal again!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We share this for three reasons. First, we assume that by “cracked,” heidi meant “opened.” And we just want to assure all reading that this is nothing to say oops about. Our intention here is for the bottles to be opened and even consumed.</p>
<p>Second, we wanted to let heidi know we are offering this wine again.</p>
<p>Third, and most important, we want everyone to understand that this stuff isn’t just a pretty label slapped on a mediocre bottle of wine. The stuff inside is good too.</p>
<p>But also, that label? Hoo-boy! What a looker! A two-piecer? With just enough medieval pizazz that it’d be perfect for an epic fantasy movie watch party? But not super gaudy or over-the-top either, meaning you can bring a bottle to dinner at the in-laws’ without them thinking you just finished up at the Renaissance Faire?</p>
<p>And all priced for less than $10 a bottle, whether you buy a 6-pack (which comes out to a bit over $8 per) or a 12-pack (a cool $7.50 each).</p>
<p>But the crazy thing is, that price doesn’t even tell the full story of how much cash you’re saving here. Because if you buy this Dragon Ridge wine, we’re going to give you a $10 coupon to use over at <a href="https://casemates.com/">Casemates</a>.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more!</p>
<p>We’re also selling wine on <a href="https://sidedeal.com/deals/6-pack-obvious-wines-n-01-dark-and-bold-red-wine">SideDeal</a>. A 6- or 12-pack of Obvious Wines Nº01 Dark and Bold. And that wine? It will come with its own coupon code that you can use on <a href="https://casemates.com/">Casemates</a>.</p>
<p>Then, when you eventually do head over to <a href="https://casemates.com/">Casemates</a> to buy some wine from <em>them</em> (who, we should add, are fulfilling the wine in these two sales as well), you can tap square-square-x-square-square-triangle-square-select at checkout and earn one hundred wine lives. But only if you have the Wine Genie attachment.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, we made that last bit up.</p>
<p>But the other things–this sale, and the wine sale on SideDeal, and the coupon codes they come with–are all <em>very</em> real.</p>
<p>So buy some wine and save some money next time you buy some wine too.</p>
