<p>This curious epitaph is found at Martham Church in Norfolk:</p>
<p align="center">Here Lyeth the Body of Christ<sup>r</sup>. Burraway, who departed this<br />
Life y<sup>e</sup> 18 day of October, Anno Domini 1730.<br />
Aged 59 years.</p>
<p align="center">And there Lyes &#9758;<br />
Alice who by his Life<br />
Was my Sister, my mistress<br />
My mother and my wife.<br />
Dyed Feb. y<sup>e</sup> 12. 1729<br />
Aged 76 years.</p>
<p>According to Thomas Joseph Pettigrew in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KIwC73jWQb4C&#038;pg=PA158"><em>Chronicles of the Tombs</em></a> (1888), in 1670 Martham farmer Christopher Burraway had seduced his daughter, Alice, and she had borne him a son, who was placed at a foundling home. When the son turned 20 he was apprenticed to a farmer and eventually came to Martham, where he applied to Alice for a job, not knowing their relation. By this time the father was dead. She hired him and eventually married him, becoming &#8220;mother, sister, mistress and wife, to this modern &#x0152;edipus.&#8221;</p>
<p>At age 76 she recognized a peculiar mark on his shoulder and, realizing she&#8217;d married her son, &#8220;was so horror stricken that she soon after died, he surviving her scarcely four months.&#8221;</p>
