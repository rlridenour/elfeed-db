<p>Aphorisms from Austin O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IbsXAAAAYAAJ"><em>Keystones of Thought</em></a>, 1914:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenge is often like biting a dog because the dog bit you.</li>
<li>Education is only a ladder to gather fruit from the tree of knowledge, not the fruit itself.</li>
<li>Humility is the sister of humor.</li>
<li>Think what you have to say, and then don&#8217;t say it.</li>
<li>Men that believe only what they understand can write their creed on a postage-stamp.</li>
<li>A fallen lighthouse is more dangerous than a reef.</li>
<li>The best blood will at some time get into a fool or a mosquito.</li>
<li>Comedy smiles from a neutral intellect; humor laughs from a favoring intellect.</li>
<li>An essential quality of beauty is aloofness.</li>
<li>The picturesque is the romantic seen.</li>
<li>The worst miser is the learned man that will not write.</li>
<li>To laugh at yourself is real life, never acting.</li>
<li>Put your purse in your head and you will not be robbed.</li>
<li>A critic at best is only a football coach.</li>
<li>A gentleman seldom meets rude persons.</li>
<li>It is yesterday that makes to-morrow so sad.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;A little learning striving to explain a great subject is like an attempt to light up a cathedral with a single taper, which does no more than to show for an instant one foolish face.&#8221;</p>
