<p>In the latest escalation of a long‑running border dispute, Thai and Cambodian forces have exchanged heavy fire for a fourth straight day along sections of their frontier, with artillery, jets and drones reported near several historic temple sites. Officials say roughly half a million residents on both sides have left their homes for pagodas, schools and other improvised shelters as shells and rockets have struck villages close to the line of contact. Authorities report at least around two dozen deaths so far, including Thai soldiers and both Thai and Cambodian civilians, as each government accuses the other of firing first and of breaching international law. President Trump, who helped broker a fragile truce after deadly clashes in July, has promised to speak by phone with the Thai and Cambodian leaders to press for a halt to renewed fighting and a return to negotiations. Cambodia has also asked the UN Security Council to get involved, underlining concern that the localized clashes could widen if diplomacy fails.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/NWJx8r56VCFuW6e4hQJP5cXc1v-JnYTCMRTJUOp1u2o16-S8ehlncb7-rVcY9UQpSsedTgJmtvCRD4RsKK-5mkp7FQ7WFZ5m5ky2U56ED5-9' alt='Displaced residents walk through a temporary camp set up at a pagoda in Cambodia’s Siem Reap province during the latest clashes along the Cambodia–Thailand border.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Disputed frontier: The two Southeast Asian neighbours contest sections of an 800‑kilometre border whose colonial‑era demarcation left overlapping claims around several culturally important temples.</li><li>Ceasefire breakdown: This week’s confrontation followed a July flare‑up that lasted five days and ended only after a Trump‑backed ceasefire, which was derailed on Sunday by a skirmish that wounded two Thai soldiers.</li><li>UN appeal: Cambodia has urged the UN Security Council to step in, alleging that Thai forces have struck civilian infrastructure and asking for international help to stop further attacks.</li><li>Thai explanation: Thailand’s prime minister has said he will &quot;explain and clarify&quot; the situation directly to President Trump, signalling Bangkok’s desire to frame its military actions as defensive.</li><li>Shelter conditions: Evacuated families in Thailand’s Surin province are sleeping in repurposed university buildings where volunteers prepare large pots of food while displaced farmers worry about missing planting seasons.</li></ul><blockquote>Every time the fighting starts, it feels like life gets paused all over again. - Rat, Thai farmer</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Cambodia: Cambodia has appealed to the UN Security Council, claiming that Thai forces have targeted civilian infrastructure and asking the body to help halt attacks across the frontier.
