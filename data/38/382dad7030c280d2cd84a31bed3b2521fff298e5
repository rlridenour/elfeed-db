<p>Hooray! The 2026 Productivity Field Guide lives.</p>



<p>This is the course that teaches you to stop optimizing and start becoming.</p>



<p>Most productivity advice is about doing more, faster. This course is about identifying who you want to become in every role you play and building systems to get there.</p>



<p>The ancient Greeks called it Arete: the pursuit of excellence in your own character. The kind of thing that makes you want to leap out of bed and put a dent in the universe.</p>



<p>What’s inside:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>80+ video lessons (8+ hours of focused instruction)</li>



<li>A 140+ page book (ePub and PDF)</li>



<li>The complete system: roles, Arete, reviews, hyper-scheduling, shutdown rituals</li>
</ul>



<p>New for 2026:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Shadow Roles &amp; The Inner Vader</li>



<li>The Arete Radar (and the meditative gap)</li>



<li>Physical Anchors</li>



<li>Solving for Meaningfulness</li>



<li>The Blank Page Ritual</li>



<li>The Overhead Tax</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Two Editions:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Essentials Edition</strong> — All videos and the book<br><strong>Pro Edition</strong> — Adds the eight-session Workshop Series with live implementation, Q&amp;A, and companion guides. Plus invitations to live quarterly planning sessions throughout 2026.<br>​</p>



<p>Both editions are 10% off through January 26th with code PFG26LAUNCH.</p>

<p><br>​This system works. I’ve been teaching it for two years and I’ve seen the results on myself and others. However, if you’re looking for a quick hack, this isn’t for you.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for something that fundamentally changes how you approach your life and work, this is it.</p>



<p>P.S. The Pro Edition Workshop Series is brand new for 2026. Eight structured sessions walking through the entire system:<br>​</p>



<p>Also, in 2026 we&#8217;ll be doing quarterly planning sessions with the Pro Edition to help keep you on track.</p>



<p>All sessions recorded and added to your course library.</p>
