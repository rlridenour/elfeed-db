<p>President Donald Trump said the United States will impose a 25% tariff on trade with any country that does business with Iran, saying the measure is “effective immediately”. The announcement comes as Washington weighs how to respond to Iran’s biggest anti-government protests in years and a security crackdown that rights groups say has killed hundreds of people. The White House has said military force is an option but that the administration is pursuing diplomacy first, including a channel involving special envoy Steve Witkoff. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, the policy could raise costs for American buyers while pressuring Iran’s overseas commercial links.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ENCzOPCRewm61DRg_pr8mZOMXbL3t_427AvCtBo1CyYX10iWrWzKBpjT_IxvGBftgc6t7Yt75lmmz5Dc5YqdK_7ip56GL0xwUUCBcc0UKFSugsdqS2f3uJ65ga1IPJ9uZJnchlwfIS58WJpm9aLb9tt-x9fzKvYSOURC7foVlvzxYQkXIsFdpKI-qajv1dLEYv_FfS_bx4aElZqJgFv2--jNXd5lvhXEEfPztDQJYrsaJiO1UErERsNwJ32jE66T2Cetp1NhCcfdiUFLUA' alt='A pro-government rally in Tehran on January 12, 2026, amid ongoing protests.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who could face it: Iran’s main trading partners cited in coverage include China, Türkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, and several reports also list countries such as Brazil, Russia and India as potentially affected because they trade with Iran and also do business with the U.S..</li><li>Order details unclear: Several outlets noted the White House had not released specifics on implementation—such as which countries, products, or legal instrument would apply—and Politico reported that, as of late Monday, no executive order appeared to have been issued to match the social-media post.</li><li>Economic roots of protests: Reporting described the unrest as sparked by economic grievances including inflation, soaring prices, and a plunging currency, with Iranian authorities responding with an internet blackout alongside security measures.</li><li>Competing Iran narratives: Iran has blamed foreign interference for stoking the unrest, while RT reported Iranian officials accused the U.S. and Israel of orchestrating a deadly internal campaign—claims that other outlets did not independently verify.</li><li>Legal test at home: In related U.S. politics, President Trump also warned it would be a “complete mess” if the U.S. Supreme Court were to strike down his global trade tariffs, as a decision could come as soon as Wednesday.</li></ul><blockquote>Effective immediately, any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25 per cent on any and all business being done with the United States ⁠of America - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He says any country doing business with Iran will face a 25% U.S. tariff and described the move as immediate and final in a Truth Social post.
