James Cherti has a quick tip on <a href="https://www.jamescherti.com/better-git-diff-emacs-lisp-elisp/">configuring Git to provide more meaningful diffs for Elisp files</a>. The problem, he says, is that by default Git diffs simply provide a line-by-line difference with no added context such as what functions are involved. It turns out that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to provide that context.

The process is pretty simple. First you have to provide a regular expression that recognizes the various <code>def</code> constructs such as <code>defun</code> and <code>defmacro</code>. Then you tell Git to associate that regex with Elisp files. After doing that, you get a bit more context in your Git diffs.

Take a look at Cherti&rsquo;s post for the details. It&rsquo;s a small thing but easy to do and it may make your change analysis a bit easier.</p>
