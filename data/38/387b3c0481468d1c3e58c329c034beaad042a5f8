<p>While exploring <a href="https://github.com/LionyxML/emacs-solo">Emacs-solo</a>, I was struck by how closely its philosophy aligned with my own <a href="https://github.com/captainflasmr/Emacs-DIYer">Emacs-DIYer</a> project. The parallels were sometimes uncanny, for example, we had independently chosen identical keybindings like &ldquo;M-s g&rdquo; for grep functionality. I had been also considering &ldquo;M-s f&rdquo; for my find variant and was looking for a home for <code>recentf</code>, potentially at &ldquo;M-g r&rdquo;. There were also some ideas around using other finding tools such as <code>ripgrep</code> and <code>fd</code> as a callout to some external tools and there were many other similarities.</p>
<p>I was particularly intrigued to see <code>newsticker</code> included, as I had recently adopted it as an <code>elfeed</code> replacement. The <code>ace-window</code> alternative implementation also closely mirrored my own single-defun approach.</p>
<p>So, with my first pass through, I have picked out the following goodies to be purloined and incorporated into <code>Emacs-DIYer</code></p>
<ul>
<li>dired icon replacements</li>
<li>Git gutter status overlay</li>
<li>Hide completion buffer when icomplete in buffer</li>
<li>ollama alternative directly from ansi-term</li>
</ul>

<p>Firstly, the dired icon replacement provides visual clarity without requiring the <code>all-the-icons</code> packages. While perhaps not essential, it gives me a comfy feel and I think these icons significantly improve the Emacs experience, particularly for frequent dired users like myself.</p>
<p>I pretty much just copied the entire <code>emacs-solo-dired-icons</code> section but stripped out the <code>use-package</code> as I&rsquo;m trying to keep <code>Emacs-DIYer</code> compatible with older versions of Emacs.  This worked straight out the box (like all the other integrations) and I just needed to make sure I have the requisite font collection installed.</p>
<hr>
<p>The git status indicator in the dired gutter was a welcome addition I hadn&rsquo;t previously implemented or even considered. It provides immediate visual feedback that feels natural and intuitive, especially coming from a background of extensive version control experience.</p>
<p>Having used <code>subversion</code> for over 20 years (before transitioning to <code>TortoiseSVN</code> and then <code>magit</code> and <code>vc</code>), I was already accustomed to status characters like &ldquo;M&rdquo; indicating modified files and other single key status key definitions seem consistent to my previous experience, and isn&rsquo;t it great to see them visible in dired!</p>
<p>In summary, this integration complements my existing modeline status indicator, along with <code>vc</code> and gives me both file-specific and directory-level version control visibility, noice!</p>

<p>I had been working on replacing <code>corfu/company</code> with in-buffer completion, but hadn&rsquo;t solved how to hide the completion buffer when using <code>icomplete</code>. My settings already closely matched those in Emacs-solo, but the critical missing piece was this elegant advice:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(if icomplete-in-buffer
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    (advice-add <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;completion-at-point</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>                :after <span style="color:#a6e22e">#&#39;</span>minibuffer-hide-completions))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now it feels much cleaner and I might start using it rather than <code>corfu</code> from now on.</p>
<hr>
<p>The final act of pilfering is to incorporate a simple <code>ollama</code> integration.</p>
<p>Before creating my <a href="https://github.com/captainflasmr/ollama-buddy">Ollama Buddy</a> package, I had explored integrating <code>ollama</code> through a shell and I had also come to the conclusion that using <code>ansi-term</code> was really the only quick solution, but I just couldn&rsquo;t figure out the implementation details.  However, the experience ultimately led me to take an alternative approach, writing a small implementation to interface with <code>ollama</code> from an Emacs buffer, which eventually gave rise to <code>Ollama Buddy</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Emacs-solo</code> <code>ansi-term</code> solution feels surprisingly well-integrated once you become comfortable switching between line and character modes. I&rsquo;ve now incorporated this as an alternative to my API-based implementation, providing two no-dependency options for local LLM access!</p>
<p>I plan to further explore <code>Emacs-solo</code>, particularly for additional <code>vc</code> enhancements. This first pass has already yielded valuable improvements to <code>Emacs-DIYer</code>, and this has been a valuable exercise to learn from another project with such similar design principles.</p>
