<p>Kif Leswing at CNBC interviewed Tim Cook ahead of yesterday’s Apple earnings report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cook said that the company still plans to release an updated
version of Siri next year, and said that there were more
forthcoming partnerships like the company’s agreement to integrate
OpenAI’s ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence.</p>

<p>“Our intention is to integrate with more people over time,”
Cook said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/this-is-tim-transcript-of-apples-q4-2025-financial-call/">Cook’s prepared remarks</a> at the start of yesterday’s analyst call:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We’re also excited for a more personalized Siri. We’re making
good progress on it, and as we’ve shared, we expect to release it
next year.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No news here, but worth noting that Cook claims both the next-gen “more personalized” Siri and deals with AI partners other than OpenAI are still on track. But Craig Federighi hinted at adding Google Gemini as an option alongside ChatGPT for Siri <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/apple-confirms-plans-to-work-with-googles-gemini-in-the-future/">all the way back at WWDC 2024</a>, within a few hours of Apple Intelligence being announced. Still nothing. 16 months later and ChatGPT remains the one and only Apple Intelligence partner.</p>
