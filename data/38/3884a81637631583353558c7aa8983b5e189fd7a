The discount can be used for tickets at any theater that supports Fandango, and at any date and time, so purchases do not have to be for same-day tickets. &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; is required when checking out to get the &#36;5 discount.<br/>
<br/>
Fandango says that there are a limited quantity of code redemptions allowed for the promotion, and it is first come first served while supplies last. The code is only valid on Wednesday, November 19, 2025. <br/>
<br/>
There is a one-time use only per email address limit with a maximum &#36;5 discount.<br/>
