<p>Ludwig Minelli, the Swiss lawyer who founded the right-to-die association Dignitas in 1998, has died in Switzerland through assisted suicide shortly before his 93rd birthday, the organisation announced on Sunday. Dignitas said he chose a &quot;self-determined&quot; death on Saturday, in line with the principles of autonomy and freedom of choice at the end of life that he had promoted for decades. Under his leadership, the Zurich-based nonprofit became known internationally for helping thousands of terminally ill or suffering people, including many from countries where assisted suicide remains illegal, to end their lives under Swiss law. The association said it will continue his work as a &quot;professional and combative&quot; international organisation for self-determination and end-of-life choice.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eSdaUjA23oXLtecjDhL12XTC-sGl0bvIcBGC7HvVKSJ73l8EEH3LusJ4tsB3DG8vw7JxfvpNrzjF36wszu6DkIX9ex73ZrpRLm3R_ZjlpM7brdk2ngW4jV025bXGv5YsLYGMVnVTRWN21u1J0606wCLLklu6THdOGrg' alt='Ludwig Minelli, founder of Swiss right-to-die association Dignitas.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Role in Germany: Reports credit Minelli&#x27;s legal and advocacy efforts with playing an important role in the 2020 ruling that removed a blanket ban on assisted suicide services in Germany, opening the way for such services to operate there.</li><li>Swiss legal framework: In Switzerland, assisted suicide is allowed as long as those who help do not act from selfish motives, a standard set out in Article 115 of the Swiss Penal Code that organisations like Dignitas must follow.</li><li>International clientele: Because many countries still prohibit assisted suicide, Dignitas has for years accepted patients from abroad, creating what critics and supporters alike describe as a form of &quot;suicide tourism&quot; to Switzerland.</li><li>Organisational motto: Dignitas operates under the slogan &quot;To live with dignity – To die with dignity,&quot; reflecting its stated aim to support both quality of life and self-determined end-of-life decisions.</li><li>Human-rights framing: The association described Minelli’s life work as a fight for &#x27;freedom of choice, self-determination, and human rights&#x27; in how and when people may end unbearable suffering.</li></ul><blockquote>Life for freedom of choice, self-determination, and human rights - Dignitas statement on Ludwig Minelli</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Dignitas: The association praised Minelli’s decades of campaigning and said it would continue to manage and develop itself in the spirit of its founder as an international organisation for self-determination and freedom of choice at the end of life.
