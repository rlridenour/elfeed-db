<p>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is visiting Washington this week for a White House meeting with President Trump — his first U.S. visit since 2018 after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi made him a pariah. The visit is framed as an effort to deepen long-standing U.S.-Saudi ties on security and investment, with talks expected to cover a prospective defense agreement, civilian nuclear cooperation, access to advanced chips for AI, and a U.S.-Saudi investment forum spotlighting energy and technology. The trip follows a $600 billion Saudi investment pledge made during President Trump’s visit to Riyadh in May, which the White House hopes to leverage into reciprocal deals and broader cooperation. The visit also carries the unresolved context of U.S. intelligence assessments about the Khashoggi killing and ongoing human-rights concerns, which continue to shape international scrutiny.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/BD19uz-9_w65ljpAO5ruAhJzRtKkG5DPGyfQo-5SoPfTl3izotohhMHbJas3a3x2JpC6A5mJjk7LuDAhDH6uTa94qsRCsa9FeKRqpYfjg7Jn3R7m_7zkklHwQYCAxp2Grxm8wcP6lGMwXlwwM87mI2XwVpyUUH0ry2kB1h-s5wLDTgL_ntF1P3qqVf5E_etLoeC8EoDW' alt='President Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh in May during Mr. Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Investment forum: A three-day U.S.-Saudi investment forum in Washington will spotlight energy and artificial intelligence projects tied to Saudi pledges made this year.</li><li>Chip access: Saudi officials are pressing for greater access to cutting-edge semiconductor chips to accelerate national AI plans and data-center expansion.</li><li>Security ask: The crown prince is expected to press for a stronger U.S. security guarantee after regional strikes that unnerved Gulf states, placing defense cooperation high on the agenda.</li><li>Domestic politics: Some prominent MAGA figures publicly criticized the White House focus on foreign visits, even as the administration prepares to deliver economic and security wins with Saudi ties.</li></ul><blockquote>There is a page that has been turned - Aziz Alghashian</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House / President Trump: The administration sees the visit as a chance to deepen security ties, attract Saudi investment, and advance diplomacy on Gaza and regional stability.
