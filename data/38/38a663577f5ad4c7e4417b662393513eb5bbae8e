<p id="p2">Today, <a href="https://www.blueprincegame.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Prince</a>, a critically acclaimed videogame appeared on Apple&rsquo;s App Store. The trouble was, it wasn&rsquo;t offered for sale by its developer, Dogubomb, or its publisher, Raw Fury. The real Blue Prince is only available on the Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>
<p id="p3">What appeared on the App Store, and has since been removed, was an opportunistic scam <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/657370/blue-prince-ios-port-app-store" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Jay Peters explained for The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  Before it was removed, I easily found one iOS copy of the game just by searching&nbsp;<em>Blue Prince</em>&nbsp;on the App Store &ndash; it was the first search result. The icon looked like it would be the icon for a hypothetical mobile version of the game, the listing had screenshots that looked like they were indeed from&nbsp;<em>Blue Prince</em>, and the description for the game matched the description on Steam.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">The port was available long enough for Blue Prince&rsquo;s developer and publisher to post about it <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blueprincegame.bsky.social/post/3lnvalzzzas2j" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Bluesky</a> and, according to Peters, for the fake to reach #8 in the App Store Entertainment category. I feel for anyone who bought the game assuming it was legit given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/657370/blue-prince-ios-port-app-store" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peters&rsquo; experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote6"><p>
  I also quickly ran into a major bug: when I tried to walk through one of the doors from the Entrance Hall, I fell through the floor.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p7">This isn&rsquo;t the first time this sort of thing has happened. As Peters points out it happened to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24056800/here-come-the-palworld-mobile-clones" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palworld</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22879295/wordle-clones-app-store-removal-online-backlash-copycats" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wordle</a> too. Other popular games that have appeared on the App Store as janky scam ports include <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/18/stolen-cuphead-game-gets-past-app-review-accompanied-by-faked-developer-website-appears-to-be-one-of-many/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cuphead</a>, <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/fake-balatro-mobile-appears-on-the-app-store" rel="noopener noreferrer">a version of Balatro</a> that appeared before its official release on iOS, and <a href="https://screenrant.com/app-store-copycat-problem-explained/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unpacking</a>.</p>
<p id="p8">This seems like the sort of thing that could be fixed through automation. Scammers want users to find these games, so they can make a quick buck. As a result, the name of the game is often identical to what you&rsquo;d find on the Steam, Xbox, or PlayStation stores. It strikes me that a combination of automated searching for the top games on each store, combined with an analysis of how quickly a game is moving up the charts would catch a lot of this sort of thing, flagging it for reviewers who could take a closer look.</p>
<hr id="hr9"><p id="p10">By the way, if you haven&rsquo;t tried Blue Prince, you should. It&rsquo;s an amazing game and early contender for game of the year.
