<p>Linda Yaccarino, in a post on X yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After two incredible years, I’ve decided to step down as CEO of X.</p>

<p>When @elonmusk and I first spoke of his vision for X, I knew it
would be the opportunity of a lifetime to carry out the
extraordinary mission of this company. I’m immensely grateful to
him for entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free
speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the
Everything App.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/everything">I thought it couldn’t be done</a>, but here we are today, using X for everything: news, banking, shopping, payments, messaging. It’s the only app most people use.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/10/linda-yaccarino-resigns-x-elon-musk">The Guardian, reporting on her departure</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After more than two years of Yaccarino running damage control for
her boss and the platform’s myriad issues, Musk issued only a
brief statement acknowledging she was stepping down.</p>

<p>“Thank you for your contributions,” Musk responded to Yaccarino’s
post announcing her resignation. Minutes later, he began sending
replies to other posts about SpaceX, artificial intelligence and
how his chatbot became a Nazi.</p>
