- Capture in 50 fps for additional editing flexibility and delivery options.</blockquote><br/>
The updated version of Final Cut Camera includes support for quickly swapping over to the Telephoto lens on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14 Pro and later, recording in Spatial Audio on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and later, and recording in 50fps video.<br/>
<blockquote>- Quickly switch to the 48 mm telephoto lens to capture the perfect shot. (Requires iPhone 14 Pro or later.)<br/>
- Play back your Log videos in SDR or HDR with the vibrancy of the original scene by applying the Apple Log LUT. (Requires iPhone 15 Pro or later.)<br/>

- Capture in 50 fps for additional editing flexibility and delivery options.</blockquote><br/>
