<p>Israel received from the International Committee of the Red Cross the body of Meny Godard, one of the last four captives held in Gaza; forensics confirmed he was killed during the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 and was 73 years old. The transfer forms part of a US-brokered ceasefire arrangement in which Hamas returned remains and released living captives while Israel freed nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and returned bodies of Palestinians killed in Gaza. Hamas has said returns have been slow because many remains lie under rubble after two years of war; Israeli authorities have accused Hamas of delaying the process.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ckCr7zj91NpQ0SMLHYFHVYL7u9m_nYk50gl37j29jtgYVDPc5m4foBaOKZU8sUI78H6YzYki1FTWJB5WzGymamlM5GRLuNLaZm2ebnrlNdgnR032jGClNgUt09PrhvUXQanAV5sV2bOMGTGF6k2GH0ViwYw3TuYWwGPPpx7M-xvR6noAnAwDZevsZdh8ifyN3bRfZWyIFR3dvaMPQ3WP5tFpC5J0CuzB1ZNY8nwcd40KHpY-jD07g4lDaDgeqEIO1FHEAjmRYiYS' alt='Red Cross convoy carrying the body of a person believed to be a deceased hostage handed over by Hamas militants makes its way toward the border crossing with Israel, central Gaza Strip, on November 13, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Initial holdings: At the start of the ceasefire, Hamas was reported to be holding 20 living captives and the remains of 28 deceased captives, a tally negotiators have used during exchanges</li><li>Returns to date: Before this handover, Hamas had already returned the remains of 24 deceased captives under the truce&#x27;s terms</li><li>Where the body was found: Palestinian groups said the remains handed over included a body found in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, which was transferred toward the border for handover</li><li>Other groups involved: Armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad both said they would hand over remains as part of the US-mediated agreement, broadening the scope of participants in the exchanges</li><li>Remaining cases: After this transfer, reports indicate three hostages or sets of remains still remain in Gaza under the terms of the ceasefire</li></ul><blockquote>Their loved one has been returned to Israel and that his identification has been completed - Netanyahu&#x27;s office</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli government: Israel said the body was handed over by the Red Cross to the Israeli army and Shin Bet, and authorities completed forensic identification before notifying the family.
