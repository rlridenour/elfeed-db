<p>FSet v2.2.0, which is the version included in the recent Quicklisp release, has a new Quicklisp-loadable system, FSet/Jzon.&nbsp; It extends the Jzon JSON parser/printer to construct FSet collections when reading, and to be able to print them.</p><p>On parsing, JSON arrays produce FSet seqs; JSON objects produce FSet replay maps by default, but the parser can also be configured to produce ordinary maps or FSet tuples.&nbsp; For printing, any of these can be handled, as well as the standard Jzon types.&nbsp; The tuple representation provides a way to control the printing of `nil`, depending on the type of the corresponding key.</p><p>For details, see <a href="https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/fset/fset/-/merge_requests/5">the GitLab MR</a>.</p><p>NOTE: unfortunately, the v2.1.0 release had some bugs in the new seq code, and I didn't notice them until after v2.2.0 was in Quicklisp.&nbsp; If you're using seqs, I strongly recommend you pick up v2.2.2 or newer from <a href="https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/fset/fset">GitLab</a> or <a href="https://github.com/slburson/fset">GitHub</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
