<p>The <strong>ultisnips-mode</strong> is an Emacs major mode for editing Ultisnips snippet files (*.snippets files). This mode provides syntax highlighting to facilitate editing Ultisnips snippets.</p>
<p><em>(Vim&#8217;s UltiSnips is a snippet solution for Vim, and its snippets can be used in Emacs by converting them to the Yasnippet format using <a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/ultyas">Ultyas</a>.)</em></p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Syntax highlighting for UltiSnips: <code>snippet</code>, <code>endsnippet</code>, <code>global</code>, <code>endglobal</code>, <code>priority</code>, comments, and placeholders in the form of <code>${1:value}</code> or <code>$1</code>&#8230;</li>
<li>Integration with <code>outline-minor-mode</code> or <code>hs-minor-mode</code> to enable folding of <code>snippet</code> -&gt; <code>endsnippet</code> and <code>global</code> -&gt; <code>endglobal</code> blocks.</li>
<li>Support for commenting and uncommenting UltiSnips snippets using standard Emacs commands, such as <code>comment-or-uncomment-region</code>.</li>
<li>Add <code>*.snippets</code> to <code>auto-mode-alist</code> to automatically enable <code>ultisnips-mode</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install <em>ultisnips-mode</em> from MELPA:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already done so, <a href="https://melpa.org/#/getting-started">add MELPA repository to your Emacs configuration</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the following code to your Emacs init file to install <em>ultisnips-mode</em> from MELPA:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(use-package ultisnips-mode
:ensure t)</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Folding snippet blocks with hs-minor-mode</h3>
<p>Activating <code>hs-minor-mode</code> provides the ability to collapse and expand <code>snippet</code> -&gt; <code>endsnippet</code> blocks, making navigation in large snippet files much easier.</p>
<p>To enable <code>hs-minor-mode</code> automatically for Ultisnips files, add the following to the Emacs configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(add-hook 'ultisnips-mode-hook #'hs-minor-mode)</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: As an alternative to <code>hs-minor-mode</code>, <code>ultisnips-mode</code> also supports <code>outline-minor-mode</code>; however, <strong><code>hs-minor-mode</code> is recommended because it can reliably fold entire blocks from <code>snippet</code> to <code>endsnippet</code></strong>. In contrast, <code>outline-minor-mode</code> uses only the <code>snippet</code> line as a header and may hide everything between the first <code>snippet</code> and the next one, including comments.</p>
<p>For a better and more intuitive way to fold and unfold snippets, it is recommended to use the <a href="https://github.com/aki2o/kirigami">kirigami.el</a> emacs package.</p>
<h3>Hiding all snippets with hs-minor-mode when opening *.snippets files</h3>
<p>The following configuration automatically folds all code blocks when <code>ultisnips-mode</code> is enabled, collapsing all snippets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elisp">(defun my-ultisnips-mode-fold-all ()
  "Fold all snippet blocks using `hs-minor-mode'."
  (hs-minor-mode 1)
  (hs-hide-all))

(add-hook 'ultisnips-mode-hook #'my-ultisnips-mode-fold-all)</code></pre>
<p>This ensures a cleaner view of snippets, collapsing all regions by default and allowing selective expansion as needed.</p>
<h3>Is there a package that allows using UltiSnips directly in Emacs, or is it necessary to first convert them to the Yasnippet format?</h3>
<p>Yes, conversion to Yasnippet is required.</p>
<p>A command-line tool called <a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/ultyas">Ultyas</a> facilitates the conversion of snippets from UltiSnips to Yasnippet format.</p>
<h3>How does the author use ultisnips-mode and Ultyas?</h3>
<p>The author maintains all snippets in their original UltiSnips format for Vim and developed a shell script that automatically scans the UltiSnips directory, generating the corresponding Yasnippet files using <a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/ultyas">Ultyas</a>.</p>
<p>He uses the <a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/ultisnips-mode.el">ultisnips-mode</a> Emacs package to edit snippets, which provides syntax highlighting and code folding via hs-minor-mode.</p>
<p>This workflow allows editing and storing a single set of snippets while making them available in Vim and Emacs.</p>
