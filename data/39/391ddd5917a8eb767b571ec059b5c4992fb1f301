Usage data <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/ios-version-market-share/mobile-tablet/worldwide/#monthly-202601-202601-bar">published by StatCounter</a> (via <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/news/ios-26-adoption-struggles-with-iphone-users"><em>Cult of Mac</em></a>) for January 2026 indicates that only around 15 to 16% of active iPhones worldwide are running any version of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. The breakdown shows iOS 26.1 accounting for approximately 10.6% of devices, iOS 26.2 for about 4.6%, and the original iOS 26.0 release at roughly 1.1%. In contrast, more than 60% of iPhones tracked by StatCounter remain on iOS 18, with iOS 18.7 and iOS 18.6 alone representing a majority of active devices.<br/>
<br/>
Historical comparisons highlight how atypical this adoption curve appears. StatCounter data from January 2025 shows that roughly 63% of iPhones were running some version of iOS 18 about four months after its release. In January 2024, iOS 17 had reached approximately 54% adoption over a similar timeframe, while iOS 16 surpassed 60% adoption by January 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Based on those figures, &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; adoption appears to be running at less than one-quarter of the rate achieved by recent predecessors during the same post-release window. StatCounter derives its estimates from web traffic analytics, tracking operating system versions via page impressions across its global network of participating websites. <br/>
<br/>
In the first week of January last year, 89.3% of <em>MacRumors</em> visitors used a version of iOS 18. This year, during the same time period, only 25.7% of <em>MacRumors</em> readers are running a version of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. In the absence of official numbers from Apple, the true adoption rate remains unknown, but the data suggests a level of hesitation toward &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; that has not been seen in recent years. <br/>
<br/>
Unlike many previous releases, &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; introduces Liquid Glass as a fundamental visual overhaul, replacing large portions of the traditional opaque interface with translucent layers, blurred backgrounds, and dynamic depth effects across system elements. Upon its announcement at WWDC last year, the redesign received mixed reviews, which could be a contributing factor to hesitation around upgrading.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, Apple now continues to support older operating systems with security updates, allowing users to remain on iOS 18 without immediate pressure to update or forfeit critical patches. This makes it much easier for users to remain on older software.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/ios-26-shows-unusually-slow-adoption/">iOS 26 Shows Unusually Slow Adoption Months After Release</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-shows-unusually-slow-adoption-months-after-release.2475786/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
