I made the big upgrade to Emacs 27.1, giving myself a full day to work out the kinks. First off, it&rsquo;s great; I like the early-init, I&rsquo;m thrilled by the new in-box orgmode, and as things settle I love the new fonts and customizations. There is some strangeness on this journey, though (made worse by the fact that I am an exwm user, so emacs failures are system failures).
 Everything died.
