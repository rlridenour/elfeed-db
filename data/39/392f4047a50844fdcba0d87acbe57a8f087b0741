<p>India and the European Union signaled they are closing in on a long-negotiated free trade agreement as EU leaders joined Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a high-profile visit tied to India’s Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi. Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa framed the push as part of a broader strategic partnership aimed at deepening economic and supply-chain links amid a shifting global trade environment. Several outlets described the proposed accord as potentially transformative for commerce, with one estimate suggesting India’s exports could rise by about $50 billion by 2031 if the deal goes through. Commentators in Europe also cast the agreement as a way to diversify economic options beyond reliance on the United States and China.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/_pIapkOqTBlgA0vwtav4ArK04RSN2ZfwTKFbrfakzaE7uj_o-N_8dFTmPYMjzSp_D9ektQ24Ko-WA9lPc_G3vw-zJDu6NH2MZpIrylpQyv4r0aDV6ZrOWi77KDwVrU3MHwOVr9hFic9m2p9EaTiFqpELtVoczu7RDcFoy0Y0F__XsUG1yVTLxQ' alt='Illustration used with coverage of the proposed India–EU free trade agreement.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Republic Day optics: Von der Leyen called it an “honour of a lifetime” to attend India’s Republic Day celebrations as chief guest, underscoring the political signaling behind the visit.</li><li>Strategic framing: Von der Leyen described closer India–EU ties as “a new way for a fractured world,” positioning cooperation as a stabilizing, rules-based alternative.</li><li>Trade pressures: DW reported the EU outreach comes as both sides weigh closer trade ties amid tariff tensions involving the United States.</li><li>Europe’s options: The Economist said the pact would help Europe show the US and China that other powers have meaningful choices in global trade relationships.</li><li>Long runway: Le Monde noted the deal has been negotiated for years and argued agreements with India can demonstrate alternatives to US-centric frameworks.</li></ul><blockquote>Successful India makes world stable - Ursula von der Leyen</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Commission (von der Leyen): The EU presents a deeper partnership with India as a stabilizing strategic choice in a “fractured world,” linked to ambitions for a major trade agreement.
