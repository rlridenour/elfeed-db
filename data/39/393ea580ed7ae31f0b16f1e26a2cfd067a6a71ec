For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with GRID Studio to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> from Apple. <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/">GRID Studio</a> is a company that takes discarded Apple devices and turns them into collectible art for Apple fans.<br/>

If you're still looking for holiday gifts, GRID Studio has a Christmas sale going on this week. You can get 20 percent off site wide with promo code CM20, and there are also deeper discounts on select items.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">iPhone 2G is available for &#36;299</a>, down from &#36;399. The GRID 2G is one of the most popular devices that GRID Studio sells, because it showcases the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that Apple made. It highlights all of the components that were in the original 2007 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, including the curved shell, power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, and ear piece.<br/>

Apple's original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was made well before Apple started manufacturing its own chips, so there are some unique components to reminisce about.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s">iPhone 4s is available for &#36;99</a>, down from &#36;139. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S was the last &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; introduced during Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' lifetime, and it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> released without Jobs. It was the fifth &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple came out with, and in the name, the "S" stood for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that included Apple's personal assistant.<br/>

Compared to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S included an upgraded A5 chip, an 8-megapixel camera, and up to 64GB of storage. It ran iOS 5, a major operating system update that brought features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> and iMessage. All of the internal components from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4S are thoughtfully arranged in GRID Studio's piece, and there's even a look at the default app arrangement that was available at the time.<br/>
<br/>
GRID has the <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-5">iPhone 5 available for &#36;109</a>, down from &#36;139. The GRID 5 highlights the 2012 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5, which was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that was developed under Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; and the last &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple CEO Steve Jobs was involved with. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 is an important part of Apple's history because it included a taller 4-inch display, and it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to use the Lightning port rather than the 30-pin port.<br/>
<br/>

GRID also makes art from other Apple products, like Apple Watches. The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/apple-watch-series-0">GRID Watch 1st Gen</a> is available for &#36;149, and it features Apple's first-ever Apple Watch. Components include the heart rate sensor, flex cable, display, main board, S1 chip, speaker, power button, battery, and Taptic Engine, along with the casing and band. It's a fun piece of Apple history for Apple Watch fans.<br/>
