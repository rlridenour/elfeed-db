         <p>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More here:

<p>Today I talk to Arni and learn about how Emacs is used as an interface
that helps with focus and the minimisation of distractions. This is
matter of self-care. After we cover the technicalities, we switch to
the topic of socialisation at-large, where we comment on cooking
for/with others, interacting through social media versus face-to-face,
and having a sense of community. Once we explore those themes, we
consider how people express themselves through art and how they create
a persona to connect with others, while sharing their emotional state
or less obvious sensitivities. In this regard, Arni talks about
dabbling in the furry community.</p>
