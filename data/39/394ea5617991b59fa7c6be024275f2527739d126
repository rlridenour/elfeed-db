Apple today seeded the first public betas of upcoming iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.5 updates, allowing the public to test the updates ahead of when they see an official launch. The public betas come a day after Apple provided the second betas to developers.<br/>

Public beta testers can download the updates from the Settings app on each device after opting into the beta through Apple's public beta testing website. <br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.5 and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.5 are relatively minor updates, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-5-beta-features/">few new features</a> have been discovered. The iOS Mail app has options for toggling off Contact <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> and Group by Sender for a look that's more like the iOS 17 Mail app, and there are some minor changes to how <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> info is displayed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also released public betas of watchOS 11.5 and tvOS 18.5.<br/>
<br/>
The software likely focuses on bug fixes and security improvements that are not outward facing. We're expecting Apple to release iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.5, and the other software updates sometime in May.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/apple-releases-ios-18-5-public-beta/">Apple Releases iOS 18.5 and macOS Sequoia 15.5 Public Betas</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-ios-18-5-and-macos-sequoia-15-5-public-betas.2455378/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
