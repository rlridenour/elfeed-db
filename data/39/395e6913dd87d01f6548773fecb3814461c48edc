<p>John Siracusa, in a piece that, in a bit of rhetorical deftness, only mentions Tim Cook by name once:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What <em>should</em> be motivating Apple to make improvements — the
desire to make great products — seems absent. What should <em>not</em>
be motivating Apple — the desire for power, control, and profits — seems omnipresent.</p>

<p>And I don’t mean that in a small way; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KdlJlHAAbQ">I mean that in a big
way</a>. Every new thing we learn about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/659296/apple-failed-compliance-court-ruling-breakdown">Apple’s internal
deliberations</a> surrounding these decisions only lends more
weight to the conclusion that Apple has lost its north star.
Or, rather, it has replaced it with a new, dark star. And time
and again, we’ve learned that these decisions go all the way to
the top.</p>

<p>The best leaders can change their minds in response to new
information. The best leaders can <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/05/04/tony-fadell-talks-about-steve-jobs-controversial-decisions-on-ipod-and-iphone-development/">be persuaded</a>. But we’ve had
decades of strife, lawsuits, and regulations, and Apple has
stubbornly dug in its heels even further at every turn. It seems
clear that there’s only one way to get a different result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Covers a lot in a relatively short essay. I do not agree with Siracusa on his conclusion, but I’ve sat on linking to it, because — along with a few other recents posts and goings-on — it’s given me much to think about, and has helped me clarify my own thoughts, which I need to put in a piece of their own. But if you haven’t read Siracusa’s yet, you should.</p>
