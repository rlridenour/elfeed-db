<p><small>I started writing this in <time datetime="2025-01-07" title="2025-01-07">early January</time>, and <time datetime="2025-04-12" title="2025-04-12">today</time> set about reviewing some of
my draft blog posts.  After all, I wanted to use the functionality of

<p><time datetime="2025-01-06" title="2025-01-06">Last night</time> I finished reading <cite data-id="DF694105-1DA3-40C9-9F63-EE9BB0E89D8C">The Book of Merlyn</cite> by T.H. White, a book that
T.H. White intended to be the conclusion to <cite data-id="A6B3DC34-C462-46BC-8CD7-D89BDC31D6EB">The Once and Future King</cite>.
However, his death interrupted those plans.</p>
<p>It’s a quick read of both didactic dialogue and heart-warming and rending prose.
Several passages of this book ache with beauty of a lost landscape.  Of a 1940s
England with pockets of land not yet fully enclosed by capitalism’s rapine
voracity.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-01-07" title="2025-01-07">This morning</time>, waking at 5:30 and taking my dogs outside, I thought of
T.H. White’s passage of the pre-dawn mornings that the venerable Arthur
meditated upon.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

<p>There is nothing so wonderful as to be out on a spring night in the country; but
really in the latest part of night, and, best of all, if you can be alone.
Then, when you can hear the wild world scamper, and the cows chewing just before
you tumble over them, and the leaves living secretly, and the nibblings and
grass pluckings and the blood’s tide in your own veins: when you can see the
loom of trees and hills in deeper darkness and the stars twirling in their oiled
grooves for yourself: when there is one light in one cottage far away, making a
sickness or an early riser upon a mysterious errand: when the horse hoofs with
squeaking cart behind plod to an unknown market, dragging their bundled man, in
sacks, asleep: when the dogs’ chains rattle at the farms, and the vixen yelps
once, and the owls have fallen silent: then is a grand time to be alive and
vastly conscious, when all else human is unconscious, home-bound, bed-sprawled,
at the mercy of the midnight mind.</p>
<p>The wind had dropped to rest.  The powdery stars expanded and contracted in the
serene, making a sight which would have jingled, if it had been a sound.  The
great tor which they were climbing rose against the sky, a mirk of majesty, like
a horizon which aspired.</p>


</blockquote>

<p>This beautiful passage continues for a few more pages; an absolute poetic
reflection of life moving slowly and privately.</p>
<p><cite data-id="DF694105-1DA3-40C9-9F63-EE9BB0E89D8C">The Book of Merlyn</cite> echoed and rhymed with <cite>The Sword in the Stone</cite>; the first book in <cite data-id="A6B3DC34-C462-46BC-8CD7-D89BDC31D6EB">The Once and Future King</cite> by T.H. White.  Where the first book expands Wart’s perspective; the final book is far more introspective.</p>
<p>Arthur longing for a return to youthful Wart’s wonder, but is denied as he is no
longer mentally malleable.  Instead wisdom and experience temper his shape
changes and life amongst the birds.</p>
