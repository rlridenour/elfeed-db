<p id="p2"><a href="https://www.inoreader.com/?utm_source=macstories&amp;utm_medium=tagline&amp;utm_campaign=intelligence_sponsorship" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inoreader</a>, a powerful platform for content discovery and consumption, is becoming smarter with the launch of <strong>Inoreader Intelligence</strong> &ndash; a suite of AI-powered features designed to help users save time, gain meaningful insights, analyze, and act on valuable information faster. Whether you&rsquo;re diving into daily news, tracking niche industry updates, or conducting in-depth research, Inoreader Intelligence transforms how you process information with the introduction of article summaries and Intelligence reports.</p>

<p id="p4">The first addition to the suite, <strong>article summaries</strong>, brings instant clarity to your content. A new Summarize button appears inside every article, allowing you to generate a quick overview, explore a specific aspect with customizable prompts, or even ask your own questions &ndash; all within the Inoreader interface. You&rsquo;re in full control: tailor how the feature looks and behaves, set your preferred language, and define a prompt persona to suit your workflow. Summaries are fully searchable, saving you time not just in the moment, but also later.</p>
<p id="p5">With the newly introduced <strong>Intelligence reports</strong>, Inoreader levels up bulk content processing. Select multiple articles at once and run custom or predefined prompts to extract insights, compare sentiments, and create reports. Once generated, each report becomes a new article, ready to annotate, export, or share. Want to collaborate? Reports can be made public or shared privately across Teams.</p>

<p id="p7">Article summaries are available in Inoreader&rsquo;s <strong>Pro</strong>, <strong>Custom</strong>, and <strong>Team</strong> plans, while Intelligence reports are included in the new <strong>Team Intelligence</strong> plan and offered as an add-on for Pro and Custom users. All plans include monthly Intelligence tokens, and if you prefer more control, you can connect your own OpenAI API key for added flexibility.</p>
