<p>South Africa is hosting a week-long set of naval exercises in its coastal waters involving ships from China, Russia and Iran, described by the host as a “BRICS Plus” operation focused on protecting shipping and maritime economic activity. The drills, branded “Will for Peace,” bring together countries that have tense relations with the United States and come as Pretoria’s already-strained ties with Washington face fresh scrutiny. South African officials say the exercise was planned well in advance and aims at cooperation and regional maritime stability, while domestic and foreign critics warn it could deepen diplomatic friction.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/OxrXGI7xNSZWBet7ZdZ7SOVB3sxEzqavfG1_JXu-YD2scVT6hvMk8jPgww8f7XONadJmewTorZHi8MUgvlSwFyfzCo5kzZPEN2qE4n5YQbpk' alt='A Russian vessel arrives at the Simon’s Town Naval base ahead of BRICS Plus joint naval exercises in Cape Town, South Africa, January 9, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who is involved: South Africa’s deputy defence minister said the United Arab Emirates was also expected to send ships, while Indonesia, Ethiopia and Brazil planned to send observers.</li><li>BRICS expansion: Sources describe “BRICS Plus” as an expanded grouping beyond the original five members, with additional countries now included in the bloc framework referenced around the drills.</li><li>Local politics: South Africa’s Democratic Alliance said parliament had not been properly briefed on the drills’ cost, command structure, or diplomatic consequences, and argued defence policy should remain transparent and constitutional.</li><li>G20 rescheduling: The manoeuvres were first slated for November 2025 but were postponed because they would have overlapped with the G20 summit in Johannesburg.</li><li>Indian Ocean signal: Analysis of the exercise frames it as a message about South Africa’s intention to project influence in a strategically important Indian Ocean region where Moscow and Beijing seek greater presence.</li></ul><blockquote>This exercise was planned long before these tensions we are witnessing today. - Bantu Holomisa</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>South African National Defence Force: The defence force says the drills are meant to share best practices, improve joint operational capability, and support safer shipping routes and regional maritime stability.
