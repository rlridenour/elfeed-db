I see many threads on Reddit and blog posts about using email inside Emacs. I mean, I already have org-mode which organizing my whole digital life. But then all my work email is provided through outlook, which does not allow me to fetch email with anything other then their proprietary software.
Microsoft outlooked was designed to be used by people writing marketing emails, not people talking about code. There is no way to distinguish what is code from what is text, or call our programming symbols from the rest of the prose.
