<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s time to redo my blog again.</p>
<p>This time I found an ultra light-weight blog theme. This page here is under 100KB!</p>
<p>I wanted to make something that acts more like a homepage for my research, rather than a blog. I still have all my blog posts, but now the focus will be on a more professional presentation of my work.</p>
<p>This theme is really what I&rsquo;ve wanted all along: a home page with a max-width for the text, table of contents, and built-in local search!</p>
