<p>Rees was awarded the prize for his paper, &#8220;Abductive Arguments for Ethical Error-Theory: The Relevance of Non-Cognitivism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the abstract of the paper:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Given its avoidance of explanatory appeals to ethical reality, non-cognitivism is seemingly <u></u><u></u>open to an abductive argument for ethical antirealism, and hence error-theory. Many non-<u></u><u></u>cognitivists would want to avoid this result. I argue that doing so is far from <u></u><u></u>straightforward. In the first instance, non-cognitivists have no distinctive resources for <u></u><u></u>resisting abductive arguments for antirealism. Moreover, while some non-cognitivisms can <u></u><u></u>block the step from antirealism to error-theory, one can reasonably question the theoretical <u></u><u></u>virtue of non-cognitivism itself. The abductive case for non-cognitivism sans error-theory is <u></u><u></u>in uncertain shape.</em></p>
