<p>Today we released another significant update to the Fastmail web and mobile apps, introducing more beautiful theming and faster navigation on desktop, plus a powerful new search tool to help you find the email you’re looking for.</p><h2 id="beautiful-new-themes" tabindex="-1">Beautiful new themes</h2><p>We’ve revised the Fastmail UI to make it more balanced, more focused, and pull in more color from your theme. Head over to the settings and you’ll find many beautiful new default themes to choose from, or make it personal with custom colors.</p><p><video class="aspect-video relative rounded-lg shadow-card z-50" autoplay loop playsinline muted controls width="1280" height="720"> <source src="/assets/blog/2025-08-05-better-themes-better-search/Colours.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=vp9,vorbis"> <source src="/assets/blog/2025-08-05-better-themes-better-search/Colours.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video></p><h2 id="faster-navigation" tabindex="-1">Faster navigation</h2><p>The tab bar in our mobile app has allowed switching between your mail, calendar, and other apps in just one tap for years. Now, webmail gets quick app switching too. Just like on mobile you can choose which apps to show in the settings, or turn them all off to hide the navigation bar entirely.</p><p>For our customers with multiple accounts, it’s now much faster to move between them with our new quick user switching in the top right. Log in to more than one account in our mobile app and you’ll see the quick user switcher appear there too.</p><p>Finally, our calendar on desktop now has faster navigation between day/week/month view. Want something more unusual? Click on the selected tab again to customise the number of days/weeks on show.</p><p><video class="aspect-video relative rounded-lg shadow-card z-50" autoplay loop playsinline muted controls width="1280" height="720"> <source src="/assets/blog/2025-08-05-better-themes-better-search/Navigation.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=vp9,vorbis"> <source src="/assets/blog/2025-08-05-better-themes-better-search/Navigation.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video></p><h2 id="fine-tune-your-search" tabindex="-1">Fine-tune your search</h2><p>Our new search refinement toolbar lets you quickly add, remove, or change filters to narrow down your search.</p><p>We already have intelligent autocomplete to start you off, but sometimes the first attempt doesn’t quite give you the results you’re looking for. Our new toolbar makes it faster to quickly add useful filters to find the email you want.</p><p>Have you ever done a search and found your results are being dominated by a particular sender you’re not interested in, or from a folder you know doesn’t have what you need? We intelligently offer to exclude these with just a few clicks, based on the previous search results.</p><p>We hope you find this useful in getting the most out of Fastmail’s powerful search.</p><p><video class="aspect-video relative rounded-lg shadow-card z-50" autoplay loop playsinline muted controls width="1280" height="720"> <source src="/assets/blog/2025-08-05-better-themes-better-search/Search.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=vp9,vorbis"> <source src="/assets/blog/2025-08-05-better-themes-better-search/Search.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video></p><h2 id="and-more" tabindex="-1">And more</h2><p>Mistakes happen. That’s why Fastmail has <a href="/features/undo-everything/">multi-level undo/redo support</a> for almost every action. But after the initial notification disappeared, you had to know the keyboard shortcut. Now you can undo/redo from the actions menu in your inbox as well.</p><p>Fastmail files makes it easy to host a basic website. Now we’ve added simple editing of plain text files, so you can make basic changes without leaving the app, or create a new text file on the go.</p>
