<p>I started a new <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/10/one-notebook/">notebook</a> last week and thought it worth writing another update on how I’m using it.</p>

<p>I’m still using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097GVXJV2">Feela A5 notebooks</a> because they hold up well and are cheap—as am I. I’m still using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pentel-Mechanical-Pencil-Kerry-P1035-AD/dp/B0013NE3VA/ref=sr_1_1?crid=145EX8FGLUVA5&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9pV7jmx-ClFpOOARaXj8KstAXBWPEdP4UEqER_i6JgZaSUydf1lRla_AyQV0Fkbdyi-PZs3UobzbJkACPLKIE1djhcrqrTrejHVhPC3W9TBFGMvqE-DOM-Ng1Po5kBzcxSRsmHa16MEWlPPWFSihYATp3p0VC_pjeVeScl4jsm9xVi2IlHYsU6Ageb4nf06Oq6StKH0i5p9xkhhBiJ5bzu13UnVWMIYpjYy4quYJLHHfETeSOBfX4I7TqOvgLDixh7i6P7XGfFvi79Agdkr13g5HD8NliaugXAp99eGl4-4.5sC0r9vd7LsR76pkq3iZg6CV99ALKSsoIMa2EOy9zis&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=pentel%2Bkerry%2B0.5&amp;qid=1754446329&amp;sprefix=pentel%2Bkerry%2Caps%2C128&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1">Pentel Kerry mechanical pencil</a>; that’s it tucked in the notebook’s loop. I’m still keeping my index of pages in an iCloud file called <code>Notebook index.txt</code>, and most of the index entries are still added through dictation via <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/10/dictation-automation/">a Shortcut</a> on my iPhone.</p>
<p>What’s new is that I’ve started keeping a to-do list in the notebook. I’m not busy enough to have a daily list, but a weekly list works well. Every Monday I write out two lists on a two-page spread: this week’s tasks on the left side and future tasks on the right:</p>
<p><img alt="Open notebook showing this week’s and later tasks" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2025/20250805-Open%20notebook%20showing%20this%20week%E2%80%99s%20and%20later%20tasks.jpg" title="Open notebook showing this week’s and later tasks" width="100%"/></p>
<p>A few things I want to mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>I took the photos for this post this morning. I have since done the weeding that’s third on the list, and I added a task for writing this post. I add the date next to the checkbox when I complete a task. I know there are <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/book">systems</a> that suggest markings other than checkboxes. Too fussy for me.</li>
<li>The future tasks on the right are not the sort of overarching life goals you often see productivity gurus suggest. I don’t need to write down goals like that. The tasks on the right-hand page are basically the same sorts of things that are on the left-hand page, although typically a little less detailed. The only real difference is that I don’t expect to do them this week. I still write them down because otherwise I’d forget them.</li>
<li>I add <a href="https://www.japanvault.com/washi-tape-what-is-washi-tape-how-do-you-use-it/">washi tape</a> to tab the weekly task page for quick access and slice off last week’s tag with an X-ACTO knife. Washi tape is one of those things notebook freaks like to use, and of course I learned about it from <a href="https://www.relay.fm/penaddict">Brad Dowdy and Myke Hurley</a>. Sometimes I print out images from my computer to put into the notebook; I now use washi tape instead of Scotch tape to stick them in place. Apparently washi tape is <em>not</em> too fussy for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>My notebook index file currently covers 8 notebooks and has over 500 entries. I got those numbers via <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/man/man1/egrep.html"><code>egrep</code></a>. The entries for each new book start with a line like</p>
<pre><code>Book: 2023-06-12 to 2023-09-24
</code></pre>
<p>so I can count the number of books using</p>
<pre><code>egrep -c '^Book:' 'Notebook index.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>Each entry line starts with the date in <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code> format, so they’re counted using</p>
<pre><code>egrep -c '^\d{4}-\d\d-\d\d' 'Notebook index.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>I’ve been doing the one-notebook thing for about three years now. It’s one of the few productivity undertakings that I’ve stayed with for multiple years with no breaks.</p>
