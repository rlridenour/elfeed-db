One of <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/Docker">Docker</a>&#39;s use cases is to set up identical development environments easily and quickly for a dev team.
Recently, I had an opportunity to give it a try, and build Docker images for <a href="https://github.com/qtile/qtile">Qtile</a>, as it didn&#39;t have one yet as I get involved. With the images, it&#39;s easy to set up the environment to easily run the tests, and build the documentation.</p>

The best way to have a basic idea of Docker is to think it like a chroot environment, as Chris Tankersley stated in his <a href="https://leanpub.com/dockerfordevs">Docker for Developers</a>.
And two basic concepts of Docker are image and container, containers to images are what objects to classes as in OOP terminology.</p>
