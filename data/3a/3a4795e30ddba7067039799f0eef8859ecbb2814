<p>I knew I had it saved somewhere: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/20/apple-watch-users-workout-app-complaints/">Apple Watch Users Claim Workout App Is Now Worse in Every Way</a>. Yep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m used to my Apple Watch asking me if I want to record my walk as a workout if it detects a certain distance. That&rsquo;s fine. What I don&rsquo;t like is having it <em>nag</em> me over and over to record my walk. I need to mute it, which means finding the Mute button, which means taking off my glove on one hand and pulling up my sleeve with the other.</p>
<p>When I actually want to track a workout, it keeps nagging me to <em>pause</em> it if I stand too long. This can happen when I wait at a traffic light or when I tie my shoes. It also happens at home, when I work out and take breaks between sets, I often do something else as well - watering the plants, cleaning up some trash, etc.</p>
<p>Why? What&rsquo;s the rush? There is an option to turn off resume reminders; maybe this will be it, but why is it on by default? Do people need to be reminded to keep walking somewhere? If I do two sets instead of three, it&rsquo;s because I choose to stop; I don&rsquo;t need to be nagged to continue, and if there&rsquo;s a traffic light in the way, well, I don&rsquo;t want to get run over, OK? yeesh.</p>
