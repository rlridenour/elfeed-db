<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>It has been almost a year since I started to use Org-Roam.
I initially migrated from Obsidian even though I was incredibly happy with it.</p>
<p>Recently I started to take more notes than usual and noticed that Org-Roam has some issues
that for me aren&rsquo;t critical but disturbing.</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<h3 id="no-build-in-search-functionality">No build-in search functionality</h3>
<p>There is just no something like <code>M-x org-roam-search</code>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure there is no such thing because it&rsquo;s Emacs and you can search any directory you want very quickly
using built-in <code>grep</code>, <code>rgrep</code> or other tools like that.
And of course you can make a function off of that and then bind it to a key chord you like.</p>
<p>But having such function already there will not force Org-Roam users to add more
lines to their config.</p>
<h3 id="org-roam-node-insert---dont-understand-a-word-at-point">org-roam-node-insert - don&rsquo;t understand a word at point</h3>
<p><code>org-roam-node-insert</code> is very useful. Is how you link notes together.</p>
<p>At the moment when note is typed I usually quickly review it and then connect it to other notes.
In such a case I move my cursor to a word that I&rsquo;m going to use as a link and type that command.</p>
<p>The minibuffer starts listing all the notes but the &ldquo;linking word&rdquo; my cursor is at isn&rsquo;t used.</p>
<p>There is no such issue in case you mark a word and then call <code>M-x org-roam-node-insert</code>.</p>
<p>Again, since it&rsquo;s Emacs it should be quite easy to fix.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have it default though. I can&rsquo;t find arguments against it.</p>
<h3 id="note-creation-date">Note creation date</h3>
<p>Yes, it is in a file name BUT</p>
<p>if you use grep or even something like consult-grep for searching in your notes you will not be able to
filter your results by a date.</p>
<p>It probably can be fixed with org roam templates.</p>
<h3 id="note-ids">Note IDs</h3>
<p>I was able to find many complains about it.</p>
<p>For me it&rsquo;s not that serious in terms of fear that my notes and links may stop working
if I loose the roam db (the db is just a cache) or roam is not supported anymore (org files are text).</p>
<p>The main issue for me here is that I can&rsquo;t understand the links if I open my notes in an editor that
doesn&rsquo;t have Org Mode. It sometimes happens. It happens on my Android. It happens on my Windows machine that I barely use and I don&rsquo;t even need Emacs there.</p>
<p>In such a case I see the link with an ID and description of that link which sometimes doesn&rsquo;t exactly match a note file name.</p>
<p>If org format is pure text and intended to be human readable, it&rsquo;s probably should stay this way.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It should be understood that Org-Roam is open source and community driven. It definitely can be improved as, probably, any software.</p>
<p>The only person I can blame for not implementing those functionalities I mentioned is me.
The project is opened for everyone to contribute (including me) so I hope I can fix those things somehow.</p>
