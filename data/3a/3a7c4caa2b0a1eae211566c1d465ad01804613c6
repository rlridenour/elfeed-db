<p>Hey,</p>
<p>sometimes I accidentaly print binary file with <code>cat &lt;thefile.bin&gt;</code> and my
terminal is getting broken after that due to printing of some escape characters.</p>
<p>To fix it you can use <code>reset</code> command. Checkout the <code>man reset</code> to get more info about this command.</p>
