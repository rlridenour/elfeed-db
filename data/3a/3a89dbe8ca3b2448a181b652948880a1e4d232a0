<li>Compression socks provide snug comfort for your feet</li>

<li>Good to wear for minor tweaks/aches/bouts of stiffness</li>

</ul><h1>Small Bit Of Relief</h1><p>Hello, it’s me. Your body. And I’m here to remind you: we’re about to enter a weird few months.</p>
<p>First of all, regardless of your best intentions, you are going to eat some absolutely ridiculous things. A heaping helping of turkey and gravy? Mashed potatoes and butter? Sweet potatoes with marshmallows? Macaroni and cheese? On any given day the rest of the year, you would consider one of these things to be an extravagant treat. But soon, you will consume all of them at a single meal.</p>
<p>And what’s more, depending on the leftover situation and Friendsgivings and work potlucks and holiday parties, you might eat this meal, or its rough equivalent, <em>multiple</em> times, maybe even in the same week.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, did I mention the pies?</p>
<p>What complicates things is that, if you’re not a gym member, the avenues with which to combat said uptick in caloric intake with caloric burn–running, walking, cycling, et cetera–will be made more difficult, if not treacherous, due to a confluence of environmental factors.</p>
<p>The darkness of night? It’s arriving earlier.</p>
<p>The temperatures? They’re dipping.</p>
<p>Soon, there may be ice and snow.</p>
<p>Not to mention the increase in gravity. After all, what else could explain the recent intensity with which your feet hit the ground? Definitely not the infusion of ten times more carbs, sugar, dairy, and tryptophan into your diet.</p>
<p>Point is: I, your body, will be in my time of most requiring activity while also being in the season wherein activity gets more difficult.</p>
<p>Which means: I’m gonna get suffer some tweaks.</p>
<p>Probably nothing serious, of course, but a strain here, some stiffness there, aches, tingles, discomfort. The sort of thing that compression stuff, like all this on offer here today, can relieve (or, at least, lessen). Neither the socks nor the knee sleeves will solve a a tear or a sprain or anything like that. But for the minor stuff? Oh yeah, these will help. (You can also wear them even if nothing’s tweaked, just to keep everything tight.)</p>
<p>Sounds nice, right?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I gotta go. I got plans to bump an elbow lightly on the doorframe, so that you can experience low-grade irritation at the area of impact for, like, two months.</p>
<p>It’s gonna be great!</p>
