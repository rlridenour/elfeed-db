Apple reclaimed the leading position in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2025 as strong demand for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup offset a contracting market and growing supply-chain pressure from memory chip shortages.<br/>

New data from <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/China-Smartphone-Shipments-Q4-2025">Counterpoint Research</a> shows that smartphone shipments in China declined 1.6% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2025 and fell 0.6% for the full year, reflecting weaker consumer demand driven primarily by rising prices linked to escalating memory costs. Within that environment, Apple's performance diverged sharply from the market as a whole. Counterpoint said Apple's shipments in China rose 28% year over year during the holiday quarter, allowing the company to rank first in the market with a 22% share in the fourth quarter.<br/>
<br/>
The improvement marks a notable reversal from earlier in 2025, when Apple trailed domestic competitors in China. According to Counterpoint, the change was driven by strong demand for the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup, which accounted for roughly 20% of Apple's shipments in China during the quarter. The firm noted demand was particularly concentrated among the Pro models. Counterpoint added that Apple benefited from an accelerated supply ramp up late in the year, enabling it to meet holiday demand more effectively than some rivals that were constrained by component availability.<br/>
<br/>
The notable exception within Apple's lineup was the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>. Counterpoint said the model captured only a low single-digit share of Apple's China shipments following its debut. This is attributed to a slower start due to the device's later launch compared with other regions and to perceived trade-offs between its ultra-thin design and overall feature set.<br/>
<br/>
For the full year, Apple did not lead the Chinese market, but it narrowed the gap with domestic competitors. Counterpoint said Huawei ranked first in China for 2025 with a 16.4% market share, followed closely by Apple and vivo at around 16% each. Xiaomi and Oppo trailed slightly behind at roughly 15% each. <br/>

According to IDC's <a href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P8397">Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker</a>, global smartphone shipments reached 1.26 billion units in 2025, up 1.9% year over year. Globally, Apple remained the largest smartphone vendor in 2025, shipping 247.8 million iPhones for a 19.7% market share. Apple's shipments grew 6.3% year over year. Samsung ranked second with 241.2 million units shipped and a 19.1% share, while Xiaomi placed third with 165.3 million units and a 13.1% share, despite a year-over-year decline.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/">Counterpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/idc/">IDC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/apple-regains-top-spot-in-china/">Apple Regains Top Spot in China&#039;s Smartphone Market</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-regains-top-spot-in-chinas-smartphone-market.2476337/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
