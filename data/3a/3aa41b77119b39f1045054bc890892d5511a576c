<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">Wikipedia</a>, skeuomorph <em>ˈskjuːəmɔrf</em> is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues from structures that were necessary in the original. Examples include pottery embellished with imitation rivets reminiscent of similar pots made of metal and a software calendar that imitates the appearance of binding on a paper desk calendar.</p>
