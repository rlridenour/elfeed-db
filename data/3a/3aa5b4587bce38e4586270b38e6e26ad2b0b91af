  <p>I think that’s the real revelation here. It’s less about
consumption and more about <em>creation</em>. I <a href="https://500ish.com/wither-on-the-vine-d8893fddf07e?ref=spyglass.org">previously wrote</a>
about how I was an early investor in Vine in part because it felt
like it could be analogous to Instagram. Thanks in large part to
filters, that app made it easy for anyone to think they were good
enough to be a photographer. It didn’t matter if they were or not,
they <em>thought</em> they were — I was one of them — so everyone
posted their photos. Vine felt like it could have been that for
video thanks to its clever tap-to-record mechanism. But actually,
it became a network for a lot of really talented amateurs to
figure out a new format for funny videos on the internet. When
Twitter acquired the company and dropped the ball, TikTok took
that idea and scaled it (thanks to ByteDance paying um, <em>Meta</em>
billions of dollars for distribution, and their own very smart
algorithms).</p>

<p>In a way, Sora feels like enabling everyone to be a TikTok
creator.</p>

<p>I don’t want to predict if Sora is a fad or has staying power, but so far <a href="https://sora.chatgpt.com/p/s_68e5c38a9d28819193068a89359164f7">I enjoy it</a> in a way that I haven’t enjoyed a new social network in years. It’s just fun to dash off a stupid video with no more work than a quick text prompt, and the friends I’m following are making some damn funny clips every day.</p>
