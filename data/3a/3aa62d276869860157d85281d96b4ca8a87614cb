<p>I&#39;ve been using <a href="https://magit.vc">Magit</a> in Emacs for many years and on larger (and some smaller) projects there would usually be a 3 to 5 second delay with magit-status and commits.  Today I&#39;ve been refactoring my config and fixing annoyances and learned that setting the git executable explicitly fixed that issue for me - from about 4 seconds down to less than a second.</p>
<pre><code class="language-elisp">(use-package magit
  :bind (&quot;C-x g&quot; . magit-status)
  :custom
  (magit-git-executable &quot;/opt/homebrew/bin/git&quot;))
</code></pre>
