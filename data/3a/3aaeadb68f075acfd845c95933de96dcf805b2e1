<p>I wanted to try out <a href="https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-everywhere">Eamcs Everywhere</a> for a while, and today I finally took the plunge.
The package is on Melpa, so installing it was a breeze, and it worked straight out of the box. The problem, as it turns out, is to get macOS to run the needed command (a script) with a keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p>The idea behind Emacs Everywhere is simple. When you visit a non-Emacs text window on your Mac (say you want to post something on blue sky or Reddit, perhaps answer an email from Mail), you invoke an Emacs frame and write whatever you need. Then, with <code>C-c C-c</code>, just like a capture template, you close that window, and the text you wrote in that Emacs frame is copied into the window you have open. It basically saves you a couple of copy-pastes.</p>
<p>I spent some good time researching how to get a keyboard shortcut to run a script. Most recommendations on the package itself recommend using a third-party app like Alfred, of which I&rsquo;ve heard many good things. But I don&rsquo;t want to get yet another app just to have an experimental Emacs package going.</p>
<p>The traditional macOS way seems to involve Automator. You create workflow in there, create the script (it&rsquo;s just <code>&quot;emacsclient --eval '(emacs-everywhere)'&quot;</code> - oh and yes, it does require you have Emacs server running, which I do) and then call this workflow as a service from MacOS&rsquo;s keyboard shortcuts, under settings. The problem there is that I don&rsquo;t see the workflow I created. I know it&rsquo;s saved, because if I right-click somewhere to open the menu and choose &ldquo;services,&rdquo; I do see it, but it just doesn&rsquo;t show under my keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>I also asked the sage advice of JCS from Irreal, who directed me in the direction of <a href="https://github.com/deseven/icanhazshortcut">icanhazshortcut</a>. I like the look of this one: it&rsquo;s an app with the single purpose of creating keyboard shortcuts to do different things - just what I need. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem to work either - it simply crashes whenever I launch the shortcut I created. It doesn&rsquo;t look like this app has been updated in a couple of years, so it&rsquo;s possible some new macOS security feature blocks it somehow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s so challenging to create a custom shortcut on a Mac that will just run a script. It&rsquo;s the very basic of automation in my opinion. I&rsquo;m probably missing something simple.</p>
