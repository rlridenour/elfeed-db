A+ goes to virtual school. She still wants me to
pack a lunch for her every weekday, complete with
a lunch note, so that she can "get the schoolkid
experience." I started by drawing food and making
food-related puns. Lately, she's been really into
KPop Demon Hunters, so I've been drawing scenes
from those:

Drawing from a reference image is good practice anyhow. Doing it on a lunch note means I get the payoff of giggles during her lunch break. Not bad.

Following up on <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/10/doodling-icons-in-a-grid/#doodling-icons-in-a-grid-reflections-on-doodling">Doodling icons in a grid</a>, it's a lot easier to make confident lines when I'm just darkening something I've lightly sketched in. The resistance provided by the pencil going over the card stock helps, too.

<p>
Looking forward to more practice next week!
