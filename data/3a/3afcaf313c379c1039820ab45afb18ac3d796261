<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Thinking how drains on our attention affect our abilities to interact.  In this case regarding email responses.
</p>
        <p>Having read <a href="https://marcthiele.com/notes/not-answering-email-is-it-a-trend">Is Not Answering the Thing Now?</a>, I reflexively opened my email to
respond.  I stared at a blank email wondering what triggered that reflex.  And wrote this response in my email client.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> Then converted the email to a blog post.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve personally noted is that once I got a handle of my email
auto-organization, it became easier to respond to people.  Easier in that when I
opened my email, I didn’t already experience an energy drain from the attention
vampires of the email deluge.</p>
<p>Prior to that auto-organization, my personal inbox was flooded with a myriad of
emails (git forge notifications, newsletters, company&rsquo;s from whom I&rsquo;d ordered,
Kickstarters, and more).  In the initial moment of opening email, I was greeted
with a deluge and needed to sift to find any possibilities of meaning.</p>
<p>After auto-organization, when I open my email client, my first view is almost
entirely &ldquo;of people&rdquo;; that is I don&rsquo;t see much of the other chatter (though it
is readily available).</p>
<p>Below is my Proton Mail sieve:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nil">require &quot;fileinto&quot;;
# Filter all lists into the same folder
if anyof(exists &quot;list-unsubscribe&quot;,
address :contains &quot;from&quot; &quot;noreply&quot;,
address :contains &quot;from&quot; &quot;no-reply&quot;,
address :contains &quot;from&quot; &quot;no_reply&quot;,
address :contains &quot;from&quot; &quot;donor&quot;,
address :contains &quot;from&quot; &quot;notifications&quot;,
address :contains &quot;from&quot; &quot;service&quot;) {
    fileinto &quot;archive&quot;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>It does a reasonable job of catching most things; and is easily extended.  It is
also the only filter that I have; because I really don&rsquo;t want to be in the
&ldquo;filter management game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this change, going to my email is pleasant, in that people are my first
encounter.  And that leaves space for me to consider the message and then a
response.</p>
<p>I also shifted my email composition to use my preferred text editing mechanism
(namely Emacs); meaning how I type for blog posts and programming now extends to
email responses.  Which is another spin around what I consider the positive
feedback loop.</p>
<p>I think that my previous lack of filters may be one possible explanation of why
folks might not be answering emails.  Namely, personal email has been overrun,
and many of us may not recognize its impact, nor know how we might address the
issue.</p>
