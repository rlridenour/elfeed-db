The Max Charging Stand holds the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; upright, with a magnetic USB-C charging dongle that connects to the USB-C port in the headphones. Mophie created the stand with the magnetic dongle to ensure that the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are aligned perfectly for charging without the user having to fuss with positioning.<br/>
<br/>
There are also included magnets to ensure that the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are put into low power mode while they're on the charger, increasing charger speed.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the upright charger for the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, there is a smaller Qi-based charging platform that can be used for AirPods or &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; that support wireless charging.<br/>
<br/>
The stand is made from aluminum so it matches well with the aluminum &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, and it comes in black. There is a soft silicone cradle that keeps the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; from being scratched, and an integrated LED that lets you know when charging has started.<br/>
