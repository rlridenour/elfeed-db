<p>Nearly 200 countries closed COP30 in Belém, Brazil on November 22 with a deal that omits any mention of fossil fuels, despite a push by more than 80 nations for a phase-out roadmap [bbc.com#1][lemonde.fr#1][dw.com#1]. The agreement emphasizes increased climate finance for vulnerable countries—including calls for wealthy nations to triple support—and launches a voluntary implementation accelerator, while Brazil pledged to craft a separate roadmap and convene follow-up talks [theguardian.com#1][japantoday.com#1][abc.net.au#1][semafor.com#1]. The United States did not send an official delegation; reactions ranged from cautious praise to disappointment over the deal’s limited ambition [npr.org#1][newarab.com#1][aljazeera.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/4kqFF7-jSLTu8Nv1ZPHhlWU3zXBz1jz23lNXvXNNRs6GbaVExIfAVfGOu4_4Ky8Nes1FGWrU5kBkkvI_ysD0A33jKol60JiGZjLmv7uUeYs6Px469FIvrIvo5OI79RWa76bBRoTt0lu7d_Sn76_wFaCBlpzizAMShxlCwnvAAK6spA_04oOvId-Lzv5ZU3gm974FrAfrbEGx5UCefjIaOxIZjZNRLLPL6N5O3qVB4A6lrqOT2y_MCkC3Kg' alt='COP30 president André Corrêa do Lago speaks as the summit concludes in Belém, Brazil.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Fossil fuels: The final text omitted any reference to fossil fuels and failed to adopt a phase-out roadmap despite pressure from more than 80 countries [lemonde.fr#1][dw.com#1][bbc.com#2][ft.com#1].</li><li>Climate finance: Countries pledged more funding for those hit by climate change, with calls for wealthy nations to at least triple support for adaptation by 2035 [theguardian.com#1][japantoday.com#1][abc.net.au#1].</li><li>Follow-up plan: Brazil will produce its own fossil-fuel transition roadmap, co-host a conference on the topic in Colombia in April, and the new voluntary “implementation accelerator” will report progress at COP31 in Turkey next year [semafor.com#1][ft.com#1].</li><li>Methane pledge: Seven countries signed a statement to pursue “near-zero” methane emissions in the fossil fuel sector [straitstimes.com#1].</li><li>US absence: The United States did not send an official delegation to the talks [npr.org#1][newarab.com#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Brazil’s COP30 presidency: Pledged to develop a separate roadmap toward transitioning away from fossil fuels and to co-host a dedicated conference in Colombia in April [semafor.com#1].
