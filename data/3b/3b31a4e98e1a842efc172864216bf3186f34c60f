<p>I've made this seafood stew a handful of times and it's always delivered.</p>

<h2>Garlic almond paste</h2>
<ul>
<li>1/8 cup of olive oil.</li>
<li>8 cloves of garlic chopped.</li>
<li>1/4 cup almond meal (flour).</li>
</ul>
<p>Cook garlic in low-medium heat until softened. Add almond meal and cook 3-4 mins or until golden. Set aside to cool.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 large handful of parsley.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blend the almond mixture to make a paste. Set aside.</p>
<h2>Spices</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 large onion halved and sliced.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a large pan, cook onion until softened.</p>
<ul>
<li>1/8 cup of olive oil.</li>
<li>1 large red chilli finely chopped (on occasions, I use chilli flakes).</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of smoked paprika.</li>
<li>2 bay leaves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add chilli, paprika, and bay leaves and cook for 30 seconds (or fragrant).</p>
<h2>Liquids</h2>
<ul>
<li>1/3 cup dry white wine (I've used cooking sake on occasion).</li>
<li>1000g of passata (typically comes in 500g packs).</li>
<li>400g plum tomatoes tin (undrained).</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of saffron threads (soaked in 2 tablespoons of water).</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of tomato paste.</li>
<li>2 cups of fish stock (I've used 2 stock cubes + same amount of water).</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the wine, passata, plum tomatoes, saffron, tomato pate, and fish stock. Simmer for 10 minutes.</p>
<h2>Fish</h2>
<ul>
<li>700g of firm white fish (cut into 5 cm chunks).</li>
<li>12 mussels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the almond paste, fish, and mussels. Cook for 3-4 minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>12 prawns (shelled).</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the prawns. Cook for 3 minutes (or pink).</p>
<h2>Finishing touches</h2>
<p>Season with salt and pepper to taste. I've added roughly a teaspoon of salt.</p>
<p>Garnish generously with parsley and you're good to go.</p>
