<p>Saudi Arabia and the Saudi-led coalition say Aidarous al-Zubaidi, head of Yemen’s UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), left Yemen and ended up in Abu Dhabi, a move that has sharpened an already tense Saudi-UAE relationship over influence in southern Yemen. The dispute unfolded after al-Zubaidi was accused of treason and removed from Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, while the STC said he remained in Aden amid conflicting accounts of his whereabouts. Separatists also reported losing contact with a large delegation that travelled to Riyadh for talks, adding a new layer of uncertainty at a moment when multiple sides say they still want dialogue to prevent further escalation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/FnkpBueA4EEYWrYXk9lHYspe7FitE0Z5jGEILz57KQjJ-w5oInGTmNnYjgwCQQxhArr1VJ_w7Lqj9CQssVgg1llewD1mQsgNI7oOlCMOubBXckVDxolEPuaGUTJtby5CBvliI9CHGcPZOaytLg2VUS2Z1Y_Izuw75xjUrGEUyEPGysUKyH6Rxao-8e6WNEK8iDWuffjLBhSL9EhUX9U' alt='Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of the Southern Transitional Council, in 2023 in Queens, New York.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Route details: The coalition described a boat-and-plane journey for al-Zubaidi from Aden to Berbera (Somaliland), then to Mogadishu, and on to Abu Dhabi, including an allegation of UAE officer supervision and use of a Russian-made Ilyushin aircraft.</li><li>Airstrike claims: STC figures said more than 15 overnight Saudi airstrikes hit al-Dhale governorate, targeting STC camps in the area where al-Zubaidi’s village is located.</li><li>Delegation missing: The STC said it lost contact with more than 50 senior delegates who travelled to Riyadh for talks and alleged Saudi authorities detained them; witnesses said they were last seen boarding a black bus at Riyadh airport.</li><li>Government fallout: Reporting on Yemen’s power-sharing arrangements said Saudi-backed allies moved to oust the UAE-backed separatist from government roles, highlighting how rival patronage networks are pulling institutions in different directions.</li><li>Fragile security: An aid official described Yemen’s environment as marked by a “lack of stability” and “security” after years of civil war, underscoring how quickly political rifts can spill into new confrontations.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Saudi-led coalition: It says al-Zubaidi escaped Yemen and reached Abu Dhabi, accusing the UAE of facilitating his departure and framing it as a serious breach within the coalition’s Yemen partnership.
