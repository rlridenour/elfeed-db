The company says that if Perplexity Search is a 24/7 answer machine, Perplexity Labs is akin to having an entire team available for help.<br/>
<br/>
Perplexity Labs can work on its own for 10 minutes or more, using tools for deep web browsing, code execution, chart creation, and image generation. It is able to complete what would have "taken days of work" in a 10 minute period, developing marketing plans, analyzing finances, creating meal plans, and more. Perplexity has examples of what Perplexity Labs is able to do in its <a href="https://perplexity.ai/labs">Projects Gallery</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Perplexity Pro subscribers have access to Labs as of today, and it can be selected from the mode selector interface on the web or in the iOS app. Mac app support is coming soon. Perplexity Pro is priced at &#36;20 per month.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/perplexity/">Perplexity</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/perplexity-labs-ai-tool/">Perplexity Gains Labs for Creating Reports, Spreadsheets, Web Apps and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/perplexity-gains-labs-for-creating-reports-spreadsheets-web-apps-and-more.2457900/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
