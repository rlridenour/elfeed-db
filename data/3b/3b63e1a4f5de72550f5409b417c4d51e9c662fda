<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/31/stern-1x-neo">Speaking of</a> vaporware, Dominic Preston at The Verge on the T1 Trump phone, which was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/16/trump-mobile">announced back in June</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fairness, for months now, the <a href="https://phone.trumpmobile.com/t1-phone/MV8y">store page</a> has only
promised an arrival “later this year,” a change made at the same
time Trump Mobile <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/693080/trump-mobile-t1-phone-made-usa">stopped claiming the T1 would be made in
America</a>. That gives the company two more months to release
it and still pretend it’s on time.</p>

<p>Trump Mobile never responded to my request last month for an
update on the phone’s release date, and it hasn’t replied to my
latest email either. People of lesser faith might worry that this
phone is no more than vaporware, but I refuse to give up. Place
your bets now on whether I’ll be back here in another month’s
time, still asking: where is the Trump phone?</p>
