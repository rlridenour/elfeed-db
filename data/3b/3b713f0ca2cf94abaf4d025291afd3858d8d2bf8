</ul><h1>Darned If You Do</h1><p>Here’s a <a href="https://meh.com/forum/topics/9-pack-unsimply-stitched-mens-dress-socks#658bb70edc0b3afcfb8b5222">comment</a> from <a href="/@ronnyd">@ronnyd</a> on a previous Unsimply Stitched Socks sale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are great socks and probably what I’ve bought the most here, lol. It’s been years since Unsimply Stitched has been here, in for 2 sets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And ronnyd wasn’t the only person to say as much. Many others expressed similar adulation for what are essentially Dan Flashes for feet.</p>
<p>And, once again, it’s been years since we’ve sold them! Or, at least, it’s been year. The sale mentioned above is from December 2023, and we’ve probably offered them once or twice since, but not as often as we used to, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>Anyway, point is: these socks sell themselves, more or less, which means we can use this space for something else. And today, that something else is issuing a terrifying warning.</p>
<p><strong>BEWARE, FRIENDS, THE END IS NEAR!</strong></p>
<p>The end of Spook-o-Rama happening now over on SideDeal, that is. This weekend marks your last chance to take advantage of this event featuring six sales packed with scary good deals, such as:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/six-feet-under-soon">Six Feet Under Soon</a></strong></p>
<p>This time of year, the dead seem to rise. But this stuff? It’s not coming back any time soon. So get it while you can.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/cauldrons-cookware">Cauldrons &amp; Cookware</a></strong></p>
<p>Want to see something truly terrifying? Go out for a modest dinner these days and ask for the check. Better start cooking more stuff at home, is what we’re saying.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/gadget-graveyard">Gadget Graveyard</a></strong></p>
<p>“IT’S ALIVE!” That’s what you’ll say. About your phone. Because there are charging pads and cables in here. And also other things.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/boo-on-a-budget">Boo-On-a-Budget</a></strong></p>
<p>What horrors lurk under your bed? We don’t know. But we can tell you what’s under 10 bucks: everything in this sale.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/creepin-into-cold">Creepin’ Into Cold</a></strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the scariest thing about October is that it brings us within two months of winter. Luckily, the products here will keep you warm.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/the-bone-yard">The Bone Yard</a></strong></p>
<p>It’s like a <em>Saw</em> movie but instead of removing one of your limbs or whatever, the torture is trying to figure how all this stuff is related.</p>
<p>So, in other words, kind of just a bunch of stuff we usually sell. But super, super cheap. And all clustered together. Head that way all weekend long if you’re looking for killer deals. Otherwise: socks!</p>
