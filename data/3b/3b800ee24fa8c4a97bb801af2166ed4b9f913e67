Jacob Boxerman has a nice <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1qx7kcv/declarative_reproducible_emacs_videoblog/">video</a> and related <a href="https://jakebox.github.io/posts/2026-02-05-declarative_reproducible.html">blog post</a> about his approach to configuring Emacs in a declarative and reproducible way. By &ldquo;reproducible&rdquo; he means that if he installs his <code>init.el</code> on a new system, he gets the <i>exact same</i> Emacs environment. That doesn&rsquo;t mean just things like colors and key bindings but also that the same versions of the same packages are loaded and available.
</p>
<p>
By &ldquo;declarative&rdquo; he means, essentially, that he uses <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a> and <a href="https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el">straight.el</a> to specify and configure his packages in a declarative way. The goal is that the order of the declarations doesn&rsquo;t matter and if one declaration s deleted, no other package is affected.
</p>
<p>
The video is a tour through a sample configuration based on Boxerman&rsquo;s that shows how he accomplishes these things. The declarative part is mostly handled by <code>use-package</code> while the reproducible part depends mostly on straight&rsquo;s ability to lock a file to a specific version. Take a look at the video and associated blog post for the details.

If, like me, you don&rsquo;t have multiple machines that you require to provide <i>exactly</i> the same Emacs environment, you can probably omit <code>straight.el</code> but the idea of putting <i>all</i> your configuration in <code>use-package</code> blocks is a good one. It goes a long way towards ensuring that changes in one area won&rsquo;t affect things in another.

Boxerman describes an excellent way of keeping your Emacs configuration under control and avoiding problems when—inevitably—you have to make changes. The video is only 8 minutes, 23 seconds so it&rsquo;s easy to find time for it. If you find his ideas useful, take a look at his post, which explores them in a bit more detail.</p>
