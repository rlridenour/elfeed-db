According to an Apple security update spotted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/18/apples-passwords-app-was-vulnerable-to-phishing-attacks-for-nearly-three-months-after-launch/">9to5Mac</a></em>, the Passwords app was sending unencrypted requests for the logos and icons associated with users' stored passwords.<br/>
<br/>
Without protections of encryption, an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network could redirect a user's browser to a clone phishing site where login details could be stolen. The vulnerability was first discovered by developer Mysk's security researchers and reported in September.<br/>

Apple's iOS 18.2 security release notes described the bug like so:<br/>
<blockquote>Impact: A user in a privileged network position may be able to leak sensitive information<br/>
<br/>
Description: This issue was addressed by using HTTPS when sending information over the network.</blockquote><div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VUSB3FK1dKA?si=Z6oaAETbWB3SD4ro" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
