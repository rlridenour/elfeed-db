I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of you but I&rsquo;m fed up with the &ldquo;-gate&rdquo; meme. Lazy and generally ignorant journalists keep describing every would be scandal—no matter how trivial—as <i>x</i>-gate. The latest example that I&rsquo;ve seen is the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/apple-responds-to-iphone-17-scratchgate-worn-magsafe-risers-to-blame-for-material-transfer">so called scratchgate concerning Apple iPhone 17s</a>. Whatever the merits of this story, it&rsquo;s hardly a scandal and even if it were, it doesn&rsquo;t rise to the level of the actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal">Watergate Scandal</a>.
</p>
<p>
A lot of the journalists who invoke and abuse this meme probably have no idea where the term comes from and those who do likely have only a vague notion of &ldquo;some Nixon scandal before I was born&rdquo;. Watergate—named after the office complex where the crime took place—was a serious scandal that resulted in the resignation of a president and informed American politics for a long time.
</p>
<p>
Purported scratches on an iPhone  or any of the other so-called scandals ardently reported by uninformed journalists don&rsquo;t rise to the same level. The overuse of this phrase brings to mind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language">Orwell&rsquo;s <i>Politics and the English language</i></a>. The theme is the same: Lazy journalists overusing trite phrases sucked dry of any meaning resulting in the debasing of the English language.
</p>
<p>
So here&rsquo;s my plea. Can we <i>please</i> stop labeling every controversy as somethinggate. Almost none of them rise to the appropriate level and are mostly used, as Orwell suggested, to advance some political agenda.
