I use the Emacs package Gnus (included in Emacs) to manage my email, and have used it this way for years. There are many reasons for managing your email locally, and even more for managing them in Emacs, but it took me years to make it through the obstacle course of actually figuring out how to do it. It requireed learning many new concepts that our day of webmail and Exchange-programs generally glosses over.
