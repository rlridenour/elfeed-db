<p>President Trump said he is reopening commercial airspace over Venezuela, saying he informed Venezuelan leader Delcy Rodríguez and that Americans will soon be able to visit the country again. The move would reverse a shutdown that followed heightened U.S.-Venezuela tensions and is framed by Trump as a step toward restoring normal travel links. Venezuela’s airspace had been closed ahead of a U.S. military operation on Jan. 3 aimed at toppling Nicolás Maduro, according to reporting cited in these accounts. Reopening the skies could ease practical barriers for travelers and airlines, though the articles do not detail timing, safety conditions, or aviation procedures for resuming flights.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/bqJXnb4Lux5w2eAvNdmjcCpzGsyUeO96X_hrkW9qoQhiX0-S1yVBkwwMUdV9goGbfY2iNUJPWvUdwP-geqWekSw5CfkyFAzA7wUr_sXlBIL9t4OZ99zQEH2Byf8blIeQE4irZj_VDVJNxKrbnHz74tErBE3BUEEDUqsUd54Z28GaMBPIOhu80tGwkegP4UFtX207GTNKgA4sqQ' alt='President Donald Trump speaks as he announces reopening of commercial airspace over Venezuela.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who Trump spoke: Trump said the decision followed a discussion with Venezuela’s acting President Delcy Rodríguez.</li><li>Travel signal: Trump said Americans will soon be able to visit Venezuela again once airspace is reopened.</li><li>Prior closure context: The airspace closure came ahead of the U.S. Jan. 3 operation targeting Nicolás Maduro, The Straits Times reported.</li><li>Scope of order: Trump described reopening &quot;all commercial airspace&quot; over Venezuela, indicating the change is aimed at civilian aviation routes rather than limited corridors.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. government (President Trump): Trump presented the reopening as a normalization step, saying Americans will be able to travel to Venezuela again.
