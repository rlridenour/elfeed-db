If you write in Elisp, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html">Edebug</a>, a source level debugger for Elisp, can be a real help in debugging your code. The problem is that it&rsquo;s fairly hard to use and has no UI to speak of other than opaque command keybindings.

Charles Choi has long been bothered by this and has tried to fix it. His first thought was to provide transient menus for the commands but the transient menus interacted badly with the Edebug windows. Then he had an Epiphany: <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/prototyping-a-toolbar-ui-for-edebug.html">what Edebug needs is a toolbar</a>. That would be in accord with the way most other debuggers work. Even when there are command shortcuts, the toolbar aids in learning and discovery.
</p>
<p>
As much as I hate using the mouse and toolbars, I have to admit that Choi has a point. I, for one, don&rsquo;t need Edebug often enough to internalize the command shortcuts or even what&rsquo;s possible. A toolbar can really help with that. Take a look at Choi&rsquo;s post to see a screenshot of his toolbar in action.

Choi says that his toolbar is still a work in progress and lists several caveats. One of those is a bug in the NS variant of Emacs, which will, presumably, be fixed in an incoming release; bug reports have already been filed. Another problem is the licensing of the symbol fonts used in the toolbar: they are not GPLv3 compliant. There are some other nits, as well but nothing that should preclude you from trying it out.

Choi is still thinking of it as a proof of concept but if it helps you debug your Elisp code, there&rsquo;s no reason not to give it a try. If you discover issues, let Choi know.</p>
