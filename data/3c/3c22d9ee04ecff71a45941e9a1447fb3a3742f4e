<p>During my <a href="https://taonaw.com/2024/08/10/on-this-day.html">blog maintenance</a> today, I stumbled upon a link to one of my S3 videos from two years ago. These were about 20-30-minute summaries of me going over my posts that week and explaining them in more detail, sort of offering an additional &ldquo;behind-the-scenes&rdquo; look. After watching the video, I decided to take all of those videos down.</p>
<p>The main reason for that is that I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable talking to an audience in front of a camera. I don&rsquo;t like how I sound, I don&rsquo;t like the grammatical mistakes I make in speech (they happen more often in videos), and I don&rsquo;t like all the &ldquo;umms.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s different when I&rsquo;m recording myself to family or friends, but publically, it feels different.</p>
<p>I write better today than I did two years ago and much better than I wrote five years ago. With recent developments in AI, mostly Grammarly in my case, I also get suggestions for clarity and precision, which help me bring out my ideas better. I prefer to express myself in writing than in speech—I always have—which is why I always had a blog.</p>
<p>Repeating the same things is another reason I would rather not have these videos up. I already write a lot of my thoughts down between this blog and my journal, and rehashing everything again a third time at the end of the week for the sake of having something in video doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that it&rsquo;s 90% the same thing.</p>
<p>When and if I do consider doing videos again, they would probably be instructional (like a how-to video) or a recording of a game playthrough. And when this happens, I think I will skip PeerTube altogether.</p>
<p>The server I uploaded my S3 video is shutting down, as the sole person behind it is running out of money and patience to maintain it. The instance I was on was already the third one I tried after two other ones failed on me, and moving large video files around for the sake of a free server somewhere is not worth it. Besides, I don&rsquo;t like the fact that PeerTube, as awesome as it is, is just a recycled YouTube idea (classic YouTube, but still YouTube). There&rsquo;s a lack of innovation in all these federated services, which build a copycat version of the proprietary platforms, be it Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube. But that&rsquo;s mostly just my grump.</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;m back here ranting as usual, still <a href="https://taonaw.com/on-this-day/">adding pieces from my old blog and my journal</a> from time to time.</p>
