<p id="p2">Earlier today, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apples-foundation-models-framework-unlocks-new-intelligent-app-experiences/?1759158001" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple published a press release</a> highlighting some of the apps that are taking advantage of its new Foundation Models framework. As you&rsquo;d expect, indie developers and small teams are well-represented among the apps promoted in the press release. Among them are:</p>

</ul><p id="p4">It&rsquo;s a group of apps that does a great job of demonstrating the breadth of creativity among developers who can leverage these privacy-first, on-device models to enhance their users&rsquo; experiences.</p>
<p id="p5">Apple&rsquo;s happy to see developers adopting the new framework, too. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apples-foundation-models-framework-unlocks-new-intelligent-app-experiences/?1759158001" rel="noopener noreferrer">Susan Prescott, Apple&rsquo;s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations, said</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote6"><p>
  We&rsquo;re excited to see developers around the world already bringing privacy-protected intelligence features into their apps. The in-app experiences they&rsquo;re creating are expansive and creative, showing just how much opportunity the Foundation Models framework opens up. From generating journaling prompts that will spark creativity in Stoic, to conversational explanations of scientific terms in CellWalk, it&rsquo;s incredible to see the powerful new capabilities that are already enhancing the apps people use every day.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p7">Judging what we&rsquo;ve seen from developers here at MacStories, these examples are just the tip of the iceberg. I expect you&rsquo;ll see more and more of your favorite apps adding features that take advantage of the Apple Foundation Models in the coming months.</p>
