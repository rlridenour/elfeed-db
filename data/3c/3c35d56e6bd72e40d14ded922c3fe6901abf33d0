<p>Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy revoked the Ukrainian citizenship of Odesa’s elected mayor, Hennadiy Trukhanov, over allegations he held a Russian passport, a status that would violate rules barring officials from dual citizenship; Trukhanov denies the claim and says he will challenge the decision in court [lemonde.fr#1][scmp.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][reuters.com#1]. In the latest step, Zelenskyy appointed former regional governor Serhiy Lysak to lead a newly created city military administration in the Black Sea port, a wartime practice that centralizes local authority under the presidency [reuters.com#1][rferl.org#1]. Reuters noted such administrations are common during the war, though some opponents have criticized them as undemocratic; nationwide elections remain suspended under martial law [reuters.com#1]. RFE/RL described Odesa as a strategic port city, underscoring the significance of maintaining cohesive governance there during the conflict [rferl.org#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/tT8DEg7SnqsQiVP3OnhO9CkvE3Kyy11sT29c0KsvGTetnhJ3Bw9ebaM-0vObYOAmreCZb3J38U1xQBIzTKBCz-FJSq90N1kcO8rYGiCiBl3p0hkBsFptSMM8ZSjy47theAMI1P6jp_3wntKDZ0EWpHD1-cxySdGZtJoRf-QkvpoVG_ePBlmBC5vxyGBSQFsHiglesHmFpuiVD97rEn0giacZrntEaEQOWmCBZyrHGWY-xqHIZTVhAvhYL7lGF64SIkXRIvpHV2AvfiKfUk96bWtg' alt='Mayor of Odesa Hennadiy Trukhanov speaks in Odesa, Ukraine, April 8, 2022.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Citizenship decision: Zelenskyy revoked Mayor Hennadiy Trukhanov’s Ukrainian citizenship over an alleged Russian passport, which he denies and plans to contest in court [lemonde.fr#1][scmp.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][reuters.com#1].</li><li>New leadership: Zelenskyy appointed Serhiy Lysak, a former regional governor, to head a newly created Odesa city military administration [reuters.com#1].</li><li>Wartime framework: City military administrations are a common wartime practice in Ukraine that grant the president greater control over local authorities, though some opponents have called this undemocratic [reuters.com#1].</li><li>Legal context: Ukrainian officials are prohibited from holding dual citizenship, the rule at the heart of the allegation against Trukhanov [scmp.com#1][aljazeera.com#1].</li><li>Strategic city: Odesa is a strategic Black Sea port, heightening the national focus on its governance during the war [rferl.org#1][reuters.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>Odessa deserves greater protection and support.
