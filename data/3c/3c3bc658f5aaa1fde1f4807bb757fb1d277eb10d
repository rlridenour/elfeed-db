</ul><h1>Very Okay</h1><p>What’s the most Meh product Meh has ever offered?</p>
<p>Some would point to the time <a href="https://meh.com/deals/a-few-pounds-of-melted-candy-corn-and-a-knife">we sold a bunch of melted candy corn along with a knife</a>. But others might say that this was an outstandingly stupid sale, and therefore does not correctly embody the shrug-emoji ethos of our name.</p>
<p>My own personal favorite most Meh product Meh has ever sold is <a href="https://meh.com/deals/chefman-k-cup-buzz-brewer-with-bluetooth-speaker-usb-charging">the pod coffee machine with the bluetooth speaker built-in</a>. Finally, not-so-great coffee with some not-so-great sound! What’s not to not-really-love?</p>
<p>Even this, though, feels a bit too brazen in its idiocy. The result is decidedly so-so, but the thought that led to it is a blinding fireball of corporate cynicism. “These stupid people love their stupid little pods and their stupid little songs. Put them together, and we’ll be rich, I tell you, rich!”</p>
<p>So, with all that being said, allow me to nominate a third candidate: these KIND bars for kids.</p>
<p>There’s nothing particularly ridiculous about them, but also there’s nothing remotely impressive, either.</p>
<p>Just take a look at some of the middling reviews we received on <a href="https://meh.com/forum/topics/99-pack-kind-kids-chewy-chocolate-chip-bars-2">a previous sale</a>:</p>

<p>These are good. Bought them a while back and they are a bit tough, but not inedible. Don’t regret the purchase, but won’t buy again for many moons.</p>

<p>(Hey, whitelightertre, the sale where you posted this comment is from January of 2024. Been a few moons, my friend! Maybe time for a re-up?)</p>

<p>I bought these last time and they do last several months. As far as taste, well realize that you are buying them on <a href="http://Meh.com">Meh.com</a> hence the meh tastiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok! Nothing wrong with them! Not inedible! Meh tastiness! Is this not the embodiment of everything our name stands for?</p>
<p>And yes, this <em>is</em> maybe not the most enticing sales pitch. But here’s the other thing that makes these the ultimate Meh product. We’re selling 99 of them for 20 bucks.</p>
<p>A pretty good deal for some pretty okay bars, if you ask us!</p>
