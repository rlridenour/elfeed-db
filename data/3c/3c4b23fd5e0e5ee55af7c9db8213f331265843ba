<p>A few weeks ago designer James Barnard <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@barnardco/video/7543872443081919766">made this TikTok video</a> about what seemed to be a few mistakes in HBO’s logo. He got a bunch of crap from commenters arguing that they weren’t mistakes at all. Then he heard from the designer of the original version of the logo, from the 1970s.</p>
