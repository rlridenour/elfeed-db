</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Venus shining bright as night slips away.
</p>
        <p>I woke at 5am, and wrapped up <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/09/27/on-an-inner-library/">On an Inner Library</a>.  Now, I sit on the couch,
Lacey at my side, publishing that post.  Venus shines bright in the pail morning
sky.  The faintest salmon colors rest upon the night dark tree-line.</p>
<p>I’m surrounded by enchantment.  Windows open letting in a cool breeze, the songs
of tree frogs, the strumming of crickets, and the occasional acorn reporting
amidst leaves and steel.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-09-27" title="2025-09-27">Later today</time>, we’ll go out on our kayaks looking for the tiny fresh water jelly
fish that live in the lake.</p>
