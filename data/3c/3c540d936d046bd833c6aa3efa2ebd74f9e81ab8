<p>The US government has announced a series of new immigration restrictions after two National Guard members were shot in Washington, D.C., with the suspect identified as an Afghan national, one of whom later died from injuries. The administration has paused decisions on asylum applications, ordered a review of millions of existing permanent resident cases from countries it labels &quot;of concern,&quot; and stopped issuing visas to Afghans, including those who had assisted US forces during the war in Afghanistan. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has also called for what she described as a &quot;full travel ban&quot; on certain foreign nationals, while officials use the term &quot;foreign invaders&quot; to describe perceived security threats at the border. Rights advocates and some media outlets report that the measures would affect not only people without legal status but also long‑time legal residents, raising concerns about due process and the rights of immigrants who have lived in the country for years.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7MQtAIAov3lXhsa2NJKcqA5NnVPm0KmihaOI9xtF21MxkYRO2m00gsq8dWd798R3aXkrmMwvCOGYW9mDJ8yHCVbNroscwJZ6YxH9xyY5v_jGeS0Thsrr0fVvKiuYIdhotm2ucwELvtbHYSRM7No16FqPVw9KVvO8ZrkzKOGC_7MC2M7eWBYvQ9yrK9bhSvH37jbCaMTEl7z-KNqJDQZg' alt='National Guard vehicles and police line a Washington, D.C. street after the shooting of two Guard members.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Green card reviews: US immigration authorities have been directed to reexamine the status of about 3.3 million permanent residents from countries classified as &quot;of concern,&quot; potentially putting long‑settled immigrants under renewed scrutiny.</li><li>Asylum backlog effects: The nationwide pause on asylum decisions is expected to add further delays to an already backlogged system, leaving many applicants in prolonged legal and personal uncertainty while their claims remain unresolved.</li><li>Afghan visa halt: Visas for Afghans who previously assisted the US war effort have been suspended, affecting people who had been promised resettlement or protection because of their cooperation with American forces.</li><li>Expanded enforcement scope: New rhetoric and policy discussions in Washington now explicitly include legal migrants and naturalized citizens in debates about &quot;remigration,&quot; indicating a shift from focusing only on undocumented border crossers to broader categories of foreigners.</li><li>Civil liberties concerns: Critics argue that using a single criminal case as justification for wide‑ranging policy changes undermines individual assessment of responsibility and risks framing entire national or ethnic groups as security threats.</li></ul><blockquote>We will not allow foreign invaders to murder our soldiers and then hide behind our own laws to stay here - Kristi Noem</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: Officials say the new restrictions are necessary to protect Americans from security threats and to ensure that immigration laws are applied more strictly in light of the Washington attack.
