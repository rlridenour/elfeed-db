<p>President Trump used a wide‑ranging interview with Politico to describe Europe as a &quot;decaying&quot; group of countries led by &quot;weak&quot; leaders, arguing that they have mishandled migration and failed to bring the Russia‑Ukraine war to an end. He suggested that &quot;size will win&quot; in Ukraine, said Russia currently &quot;has the upper hand,&quot; and hinted that Kyiv might ultimately have to cede territory to Moscow as part of a settlement. Trump also signaled he could walk away from current levels of US support for Ukraine, instead pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept his preferred peace plan and to hold elections despite the ongoing invasion. The president further indicated he would endorse European political candidates aligned with his views on immigration and security, underlining a tougher, more transactional approach to America’s traditional allies.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/smZItZk2fKNVcHSBD-knT9oFk1OcOjAIF1D2kN7nUusyThpLhA4pu9SAbm1zx56Gc01NJTZ_1FQ-YvuSroeIGUncSfuc8wDfEz08p-rTIpi0qODqX-EsdkHGmwUXy4U40HxQbvy0jJzJMFLY2JMLI0CEnCBLPbuwZNNXRWAsSOOjna8f8eOSw7xRoWJg84t8V6Usgdq97gKqjGY7TJFqJx4FOmrgG0TfRNGfbcelhk8i7Gha-lH9YqC1YxE' alt='President Donald Trump during a public appearance shortly before his wide‑ranging interview with US outlet Politico.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Migration focus: Trump argued that European governments are allowing migrants to enter &quot;unchecked, unvetted&quot; and warned that current policies could leave some states no longer &quot;viable countries&quot; in the future.</li><li>Election pressure: He urged Ukraine to proceed with national elections during the war and questioned whether the country remains fully democratic under President Volodymyr Zelensky if votes are delayed.</li><li>Peace plan push: Trump told the interviewer he is pressing Zelensky to accept his own peace proposal for ending the conflict with Russia, though details of the plan were not fully disclosed in the published accounts.</li><li>European response: European Council President António Costa replied that the EU and US &quot;must act as allies&quot; and said allies should respect each other’s democratic choices, indirectly urging Trump to show more respect for European voters and leaders.</li><li>EU institutions defend: European Commission chief spokesperson Paula Pinho publicly praised Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the leaders of all 27 EU member states, characterizing them as capable of guiding what she called a European &quot;peace project&quot; through current global challenges.</li></ul><blockquote>We respect the choice of Americans, and they need to respect the democratic choices of our citizens. - António Costa, President of the European Council</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Trump portrays Europe as poorly governed, says its leaders are &quot;weak,&quot; argues that migration policies are a &quot;disaster,&quot; and contends that Russia currently has the advantage in Ukraine, so Kyiv may need to consider territorial concessions.
