I&rsquo;ve been using Firefox as my primary browser for several years now, having left Chrome back in 2011. There are reasons for this beyond functionality; for example, I love Firefox as an example of true open source software and for its emphasis on security and privacy. These are places where Chrome comes in &ldquo;close but not quite&rdquo; and, as always, Internet Explorer is way, way off the mark. But I&rsquo;ve also come across a number of add-ons that have made my Firefox use more powerful and comfortable.
