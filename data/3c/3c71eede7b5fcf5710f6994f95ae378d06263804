<p>Here’s an update I just posted to yesterday’s piece on organized phone theft rings in London:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I forgot to apply one of the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/09/philly-plastic-bags-ban">core tenets</a> of Brian Kernighan’s
wonderful book <em><a href="https://kernighan.org/mbz.html">Millions, Billions, Zillions</a></em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millions-Billions-Zillions-Defending-Yourself/dp/0691182779/?tag=df-amzn-20">$19 in
hardcover from Amazon</a>; <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/millions-billions-zillions-defending-yourself-in-a-world-of-too-many-numbers/9780691209098">BookShop.org link to indie
booksellers</a>): always do some back-of-the-envelope
double-checking of the math in news stories. 1.5 miles of aluminum
(or even aluminium) foil from Costco is just 12 rolls at <a href="https://www.costco.co.uk/Grocery-Household/Grocery-Delivery/Kirkland-Signature-Premium-Quality-Foodservice-Aluminium-Foil-30cm-x-200m/p/97405">200
meters each</a>. I wouldn’t blink my eyes at someone with a dozen
rolls of foil in the cart at Costco.</p>
