If you&#39;ve heard some rumors of Emacs that it has a very steep learning curve (or that Emacs makes a computer slow), you may be too scared to look at it. It indeed has some learning curve (learning anything does have one), but it isn&#39;t very steep. I learned this after getting my hands dirty with Emacs a few years ago.</p>
