<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://iba-world.com/">International Bartenders Association</a>, or IBA,
maintains a list of official cocktails, ones they deem to be
“the most requested recipes” at bars all around the world. It’s
the closest thing the bartending industry has to a canonical
list of cocktails, akin to the American Kennel Club’s registry
of <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/">dog breeds</a> or a jazz musician’s <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-real-book/">Real Book</a> of
standards. [...]</p>

<p>As of 2025, there are 102 IBA official cocktails, and as of July
12, 2025, <a href="https://aaronson.org/cocktails/">I’ve had every one of them</a>.</p>

<p>The journey has taken me to some interesting places, and now that
it’s done, I have a little story to tell for each cocktail. I’m
not gonna tell you all 102 stories, but I do want to debrief the
experience. Drinking all 102 cocktails turned out to be
unexpectedly tricky, and for reasons you’ll soon understand, I
might be one of the first people in the world to do it.</p>

<p>Fun story, copiously documented with details, locations, photos, and sidenotes. Truly a blogger’s blog post.</p>
