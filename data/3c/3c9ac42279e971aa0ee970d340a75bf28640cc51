  <p>The Trump administration is “actively looking at” the possibility
of suspending the writ of habeas corpus to handle people the
administration says aren’t in the country legally, White House
deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Friday.</p>

<p>A writ of habeas corpus requires authorities to produce in court
an individual they are holding and justify their confinement.
Article I of the Constitution says the “privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of
rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.”</p>

<p>Miller made the comments to reporters at the White House Friday
when a journalist asked if President Trump is weighing the
possibility of suspending habeas corpus to handle illegal
immigration.</p>

<p>“Well, the Constitution is clear — and that, of course, is the
supreme law of the land — that the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion,” Miller
said. “So it’s an option we’re actively looking at. Look, a lot of
it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There clearly is no “invasion”. An invasion hasn’t happened here since the War of 1812, when the British got us good and burned down the White House and set fire to the Capitol.</p>

<p>You can say, <em>Hey man, look, I’m with you Grubes, but I don’t go to Daring Fireball to read Trump stuff</em>. I swear I’m trying — I’ve been <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/meta_zuck_content_moderation_zig_zag">trying since before he took office again</a> — to pay attention only to what Trump and his lickspittle loathsome hateful idiot minions <em>do</em>, not just what they <em>say</em>. But when they even <em>say</em> they’re “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus, justified by an “invasion” that obviously doesn’t exist, I think it’s on everyone to just stand up and say “Fuck that. This is America.”</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see Stephen Miller in prison.</p>
