<p>The New START treaty — the last agreement with legally binding limits on U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals — expires on February 5. That leaves the world’s two largest nuclear powers without treaty-based caps for the first time in more than half a century. UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged Washington and Moscow to negotiate a new arms-control framework without delay. Multiple reports warn that the treaty’s lapse removes a familiar framework for transparency and predictability. That, in turn, raises uncertainty about deployed forces and increases the risk of miscalculation. Analysts and arms-control advocates also caution that losing both limits and verification could strengthen incentives to expand deployed forces amid heightened tensions. Even so, several accounts point to room for diplomacy. Russia says it remains open to dialogue after the treaty’s lapse, while also warning it will respond firmly to perceived threats.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JGwloK0EQafQBPnClNv9MPNmKbVr4epw5N_xGGg_31gL97gnJUdGJbSGMy_ckMZAUFxn1IgCia2oRXJRhh_WgK_8YRQQqrVyYvIlsViTOBh24akVsBbKL39FfIFeLpGRziwuIfcFuXR367IXmf_Moo9G_qLQiobmTe5B8QPv_cKNxnOWPEEVUr9AzQyoUGpfNGJP_pUZWlDEG8wq-FxHvFTz5eowe3bDOmOW5rqyPl7HC215Gew9-A' alt='UN Secretary-General António Guterres speaks at UN headquarters in New York on Jan. 29, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>What it capped: New START, signed in 2010 and extended in 2021, limited deployed strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems, and set out mutual monitoring provisions.</li><li>Debate in US: PBS laid out competing views on whether the United States should pursue a follow-on arrangement or shift to a different approach, with arguments from treaty negotiator Rose Gottemoeller and national security expert Frank Miller.</li><li>Unanswered stopgap: Russia’s Foreign Ministry pointed to Putin’s proposal last September for a one-year, post-expiry observance of New START limits—conditional on reciprocal U.S. action—saying Moscow received no answer to its ideas.</li><li>China factor in follow-on talks: Christian Science Monitor said building a new arms-control structure is harder now because it must account for additional nuclear actors, especially China; Meduza reported that U.S. concerns about China’s growing nuclear threat were cited as a complication in extension efforts.</li></ul><blockquote>For the first time in more than half a century, we face a world without any binding limits on the strategic nuclear arsenals of the Russian Federation and the United States of America - António Guterres</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United Nations: UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the treaty’s expiration a “grave moment” and urged the U.S. and Russia to quickly negotiate a new framework.
