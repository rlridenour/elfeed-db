<p>My wife and I got a chance to go to a place that lets you paint pottery and then have it fired. The pottery is all pre-made; you just get to paint it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a very long time since I&rsquo;ve worked with a physical art medium, so the mug looks kinda dumpy. I did alright with the Racket logo on the bottom-inside of the mug though!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on some fun projects with Racket. It&rsquo;s been a really enjoyable language to work with. If you haven&rsquo;t given it a whirl, I recommend checking it out. The docs on the <a href="https://racket-lang.org">official Racket site</a> are very good, and there are some absolutely <em>stellar</em> gentle introductions to the language like <a href="https://htdp.org">How to Design Programs</a> that I would recommend.</p>
