<li><a href="https://zed.dev/" target="_blank">Zed</a> is a new text editor which is built around the collaboration between humans and AI. I am not interested in that particular activity but it is an interesting addition to the world of text editors. It is snappy, clean, and modern. I don’t have a need for it, having immersed myself in Emacs. But if you are looking for an editor, I would give this a shot.</li>
<li>Talking about Zed. I loved the fonts that the editor uses as default. They have made them available.<a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed-fonts" target="_blank">The Zed Mono and Sans typefaces, custom built from Iosevka</a>. I can’t resist a free font, specially a well-designed, clean one. Get them to use in your editor of choice.</li>
