<p>How did we get to the point where we’ve come to believe so many lies that 77 million Americans voted into the White House a criminal reality TV star from NBC, one groomed by a reality TV producer from CBS, who then appointed his Cabinet from Fox and X and World Wrestling Entertainment?</p>
<p>It’s a long story, but the moving image had something to do with it – which is to say, the way we have let television, video, and screen culture run almost entirely unregulated, purely for profit, and without regard to its impact on the minds of our citizens.&nbsp; And it’s no accident that the media and technology tycoons surrounding the President at his White House inauguration – from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, TikTok, X, you name it – control the screens, networks, and technologies that propagate the lies we’re forced to inhale every day. He invited them.</p>
<p>What’s worse is that they accepted.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It’s a long story indeed – one that stretches back to the dawn of man, back tens of thousands of years to the time when our predecessors existed on Earth without a single written word between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Literacy,” the philosopher, Jesuit priest, and professor of literature Walter Ong has written, “is imperious.”&nbsp;&nbsp;It “tends to arrogate to itself supreme power by taking itself as normative for human expression and thought.”&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrogance, for Ong, is so overreaching because the written word – writing, text, and print generally – is actually such a brand-new phenomenon in the long history of man.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our species of Homo sapiens, Ong reminds us, has been around only for some 30,000 years; the oldest script, not even 6,000; the alphabet, less than four. Mesopotamian cuneiform dates from 3,500 BC; the original Semitic alphabet from only around 1,500 BC; Latin script, or the Roman alphabet that you’re reading now, from the seventh century BC.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Only after being on earth some 500,000 years (to take a fairly good working figure) did man move from his original oral culture, in which written records were unknown and unthought of to literacy.”</p>
<p>For most of human existence, we’ve communicated without print— and even without text. &nbsp;We’ve been speaking to one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not writing anything, not drawing a whole lot, but speaking, one to one, one to several, several to one, one to many, many to one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who consider writing, text, and print as “the paradigm of all discourse” thus need to “face the fact,” Ong says, that only the tiniest fraction of human languages has ever been written down – or ever will be.&nbsp;&nbsp;We communicate in other ways besides writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Always have.&nbsp;&nbsp;Always will.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ong presses us to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of the “normal oral or oral- aural consciousness” and the original “noetic economy” of humankind, which conditioned our brains for our first 500,000 years – and which is at it once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound and human movement around sound and pictures sustained us “long before writing came along.”&nbsp;&nbsp;“To say that language is writing is, at best, uninformed,” Ong says (a bit imperiously himself).&nbsp;&nbsp;“It provides egregious evidence of the unreflective chirographic and/or typographic squint that haunts us all.”</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>unreflective chirographic squint</em>. &nbsp;We squint, and we see only writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, we’ve found truth and authority only in text versions of the word.&nbsp;&nbsp;But writing, when it, too, first appeared, was a brand-new technology, much as we regard cameras and microphones as brand- new technologies today. &nbsp;It was a new technology because it called for the use of new “tools and other equipment,” “styli or brushes or pens,” “carefully prepared surfaces such as paper, animal skins, strips of wood,” “as well as inks or paints, and much more.”&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed so complicated and time- consuming, we even used to outsource it.&nbsp;&nbsp;“In the West through the Middle Ages and earlier” almost all those devoted to writing regularly used the services of a scribe because the physical labor writing involved – scraping and polishing the animal skin or parchment, whitening it with chalk, resharpening goose-quill pens with what we still call a pen-knife, mixing ink, and all the rest – interfered with thought and composition.</p>
<p>The 1400s changed all that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gutenberg&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gutenberg.de/bibel/index.php">started printing on his press in Germany, in 1455</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The great historians of print – Robert Darnton, Elizabeth Eisenstein, Lucien Febvre, Anthony Grafton – tell us about how printing passed through patches of explosive growth, and how that growth was unnoticed at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years after Gutenberg cranked up his shop in Mainz, Germany had printers in only forty towns.&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1500, a thousand printing presses were in operation in Western Europe, and they had produced roughly 8 million books.&nbsp;&nbsp;But by the end of the 1500s, between 150 and 200 million books were circulating there.</p>
<p>Like ours, those early years, now 500 years ago, were full of chaos – the new technology seemed overwhelming.&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvard University Librarian Emeritus Robert Darnton has written, “When the printed word first appeared in France in 1470, it was so brand new, the state did not know what to make of it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;The monarchy (keep this in mind) “reacted at first by attempting to extinguish it.&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 13, 1535, Francis I decreed that anyone who printed anything would be hanged.”&nbsp;&nbsp;For the moving image today, with all of us on our iPhones, the modern cognate of hanging everyone recording or sharing video might seem extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the long view, we too, comparatively speaking, don’t yet know what to “make” of this new medium of ours.</p>
<p>That’s partly because it, too, is so young.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.institut-lumiere.org/musee/les-freres-lumiere-et-leurs-inventions/premiere-seance.html">Lumiere brothers showed the first movie to public customers in France in 1895</a> – only 130 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;But today video is becoming the dominant medium in human communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;It accounts for most of our consumer internet traffic worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;The gigabyte equivalent of all the movies ever made now crosses the global internet every two minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly a million minutes of video content cross global IP networks every sixty seconds. &nbsp;It would take someone – anyone –&nbsp;<em>5 million years</em> to watch the amount of video that scoots across the internet each month. YouTube – YouTube alone – sees more than 1 billion viewers watching more than 5 billion videos on its platform every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Video is here, and everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s part of every sporting event, it’s at every traffic stop, it’s at every concert and in every courtroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty network cameras actively film the Super Bowl.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same number work Centre Court at Wimbledon.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s in every bank, in every car, plane, and train.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s in every pocket.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;For whatever you need.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dog training.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing a tire. Solving a differential equation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing your mood.</p>
<p>It’s taken control. &nbsp;It’s just us who’ve been slow to realize it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 130 years into the life of the moving image, we are in what Elizabeth Eisenstein, writing about print, called the elusive transformation: it’s hard to see, but it’s there.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you picture an airplane flight across an ocean at night, you can sense it.&nbsp; As the sky darkens and dinner is served, the most noticeable thing about the plane is that almost everyone is sitting illuminated by the video screens in front of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The screen and the speaker are now at the heart of how world citizens communicate. &nbsp;In many ways we are the passengers on this plane, relying no longer on the printed page, but on the screen and its moving images for much of the information we are receiving (and, increasingly, transmitting) about our world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The corruption and malfeasance and occasional achievements of our modern politicians; scientific experiments; technological developments; newscasts; athletic feats – the whole public record of the twenty-first century, in short – is all being recorded and then distributed through the lens, the screen, the microphone, and the speaker.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now text may be losing its hold (short as that hold has been) on our noetic imagination – especially its hold as the most authoritative medium, the most trustworthy medium, the medium of the contract, the <em>last word</em>, as it were.</p>
<p>Donald Trump and the greedy, cowardly technologists that surround him know it.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have the data; but they also intuit it.&nbsp;&nbsp;And they are clamping down on our access to knowledge even as the opposite seems true – which is that Apple, Netflix, Tiktok, and YouTube are making video ever freer, and more ubiquitous.</p>
