<p>“Carol Sturka”, actress Rhea Seehorn’s fictional protagonist of the new Apple TV series <em>Pluribus</em>, is on Reddit right now — at 12n ET / 9am PT — doing an AMA in character. Sturka is a fantasy novelist, and Apple Books has <a href="https://books.apple.com/us/book/bloodsong-of-wycaro/id6754341665">an 11-page excerpt of her “new” novel <em>Bloodsong of Wycaro</em></a>. Unclear whether it’s Seehorn writing the in-character responses, but it’s definitely Seehorn in the confirmation photo. Reminiscent of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/severance-balloon-generator">some of the promotional fun</a> Apple has had for <em>Severance</em>.</p>

<p>Both my wife and I are loving <em>Pluribus</em> so far. I highly recommend watching the first episode without even knowing the premise, if you can.</p>
