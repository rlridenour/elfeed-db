I don't use projectile, or project.el, or any other project management system in Emacs. Maybe I should, but I "grew up" without having these systems and in my opinion they add complexity onto something that your filesystem (and git) already does fine on its own. So, to that end, I use <a href="https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs">Treemacs</a> extensively for project management.
</p>

<p>
I generally follow a Workspace -&gt; Project hierarchy. For example, here's a small snippet of my Treemacs persist file, with two workspaces and some varying projects underneath them.

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-org"><span class="org-org-level-1">* Website</span>
<span class="org-org-level-2">** cyan.sh</span>
 - <span class="org-org-list-dt">path ::</span> ~/.../cyan.sh
<span class="org-org-level-1">* Extending Emacs</span>
<span class="org-org-level-2">** dotfiles</span>
- <span class="org-org-list-dt">path ::</span> ~/.emacs.d
<span class="org-org-level-2">** ouroboros themes</span>
- <span class="org-org-list-dt">path ::</span> ~/..../ouroboros-emacs-themes
</pre>
</div>

<p>
One thing that I wanted for a while was the ability to show workspaces in <a href="https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard">Dashboard</a>, because I usually want to go back to my most recent workspace when launching a new client instance. Same reason that people want thier projectile projects to show up. Unfortunately, Dashboard doesn't have any such integration already, so I had to hack some together. If I was smarter, I would do this in a way that's more portable. Currently it requires both Dashboard and Treemacs to be installed via Straight, as per the first two lines.

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(load-file (concat user-emacs-directory <span class="org-string">"straight/build/dashboard/dashboard-widgets.el"</span>))
