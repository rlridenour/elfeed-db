  <p>To change your default app, you’ll need to install the latest
version of the Google Translate app, which was released today.

Translate instead of Apple Translate. [...]</p>

a different translation app as their default. Users worldwide can
select Google Translate or another translation app as an
alternative, and there are also options for changing the default

<p>There’s a fundamental divide between providing an integrated experience vs. a modular one. Apple, of course, almost defines what it means to deliver an integrated experience. But neither fundamental approach need be all-or-nothing. Providing default app settings makes the platform stronger. Apple should <em>want</em> to support alternatives to its own apps and services, not do so only at the point of regulatory pressure. It’s <em>clearly</em> what’s best for the platform.</p>
