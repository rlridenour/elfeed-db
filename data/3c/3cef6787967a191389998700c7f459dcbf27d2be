<li>The gel inside freezes to chill your cocktail without diluting</li>
<li>It also has a reamer for juicing citrus</li>
<li>Lid is a measurer</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: Ummm… yes, actually?!</li>
</ul><h1>Master the Mix</h1><p>This sale could not come at a better time for me personally.</p>
<p>Because as it’s gotten hotter and hotter out, and as the sun has hung in the sky longer and longer each night, and as the air has grown swampier and swampier–I’ve found myself turning not to a cold lager, or a chilled glass of white wine. No, this summer, the summer of 2025 (which, sure, has not <em>technically</em> started), has been a season of cocktails for me.</p>
<p>So, of course I’d be in the market for a rad cocktail shaker!</p>
<p>But even just calling this a “rad cocktail shaker” sort of undersells it. Because yes, it’s a cocktail shaker, but it’s also a cocktail chiller, as it’s lined with freezeable gel to keep your drink cold without dilution.</p>
<p>And it’s also a citrus juicer.</p>
<p>Like, seriously, it has a reamer for turning solid citrus fruit into delicious citrus juice. Personally, for limes, I use a citrus squeezer, but it’s still handy to have a good reamer around for oranges, grapefruits, and those times when the grocery store seems to have gotten their lemons from a grove next to a nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>(Seriously, does anyone else deal with this? Where you sometimes go to the grocery store and find the only lemons are, like, the size of softballs? What the hell, right?)</p>
<p>Point is: it’ll help you prepare your cocktail, shake your cocktail, and keep your cocktail cold.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re a little reluctant to take the plunge into cocktail mixing, I get it. After all, making simple syrup, juicing fruit, and following a recipe just so you can enjoy one three-ounce drink can be a tough sell when your other options involve opening a can or uncorking a bottle.</p>
<p>But allow me this sales pitch:</p>
<p>All that work I just described? It’s satisfying! You feel a sense of ownership over your drink. Not to mention, it allows you full control.</p>
<p>If you wish your IPA were a touch hazier or your rosé a bit drier, tough cookies.</p>
<p>But if you want a little more citrus in your marg than the recipe calls for, or your Negroni tastes a little too weak or a little too strong, you can adjust. Not to mention, as you make more cocktails, you learn certain foundational principles of what goes well with what, and you can start experimenting with your own recipes.</p>
<p>It’s interactive, is what I’m saying. But you’ll need the tools. And this shaker? It’s pretty much all the tools in one. So get one, and get cocktailing!</p>
