Intro I keep a store of some of my emails as PDFs which I later have print and bound. So, what to do when some of those emails are sent in plain text instead of pdf format? Convert to PDF so they can be bound uniformly.
From xmodulo1, there is a two-step process (after dependencies are acquired). Probably there&rsquo;s a nifty way to do this in one-line, but I haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet.
