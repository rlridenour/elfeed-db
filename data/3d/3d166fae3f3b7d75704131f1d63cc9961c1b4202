<p>Diane Keaton, the Oscar-winning star of Annie Hall and a defining presence in The Godfather films, has died at age 79, outlets reported Saturday, with People magazine first carrying the news citing a family spokesperson [theglobeandmail.com#1][france24.com#1][bbc.com#1][dw.com#1][abc.net.au#1][thehindu.com#1][dawn.com#1]. The Globe and Mail said she died in California, though no further details were immediately available [theglobeandmail.com#1].
