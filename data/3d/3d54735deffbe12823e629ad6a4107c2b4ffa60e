The Trump administration is scrutinizing Apple's partnership with Chinese tech giant Alibaba to bring AI features to iPhones in China, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/technology/apple-alibaba-ai-tool-china.html?unlocked_article_code=1.H08.u8bA.VVWEgv84BSBf&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare">The New York Times</a></em>.<br/>

Washington officials are concerned the collaboration could help Chinese AI providers collect data to improve their models, potentially benefiting China's military. Defense Department and intelligence officials are reportedly examining Alibaba's ties to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army.<br/>
<br/>
Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi called the lack of transparency about the agreement "extremely disturbing," questioning why Apple would choose to work with Alibaba given its alleged connections to the Chinese government.<br/>
<br/>
The administration has discussed whether Alibaba and other Chinese AI companies should be placed on a list prohibiting them from doing business with U.S. companies, according to sources familiar with the deliberations cited by <em>NYT</em>.<br/>
