Apple will launch its first foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in September 2026 as part of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> lineup, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jpmorgan/">JPMorgan</a>. <br/>

In a market research note to investors, the bank supported the increasingly corroborated rumor that Apple will launch the device next year. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup will apparently offer few compelling upgrades, resulting in investor focus shifting to Apple's 2026 launches. <br/>
<br/>
The first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will apparently be priced at &#36;1,999 and create a &#36;65 billion market opportunity for Apple, with high-single-digit earnings accretion in the medium term. JPMorgan forecasts foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales of around 45 million units by 2028, starting in the low-teens millions in 2027. Foldable smartphone sales in 2025 reside at around 19 million units; Apple's influence on the market is expected to be considerable. <br/>

Apple's first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is rumored to feature an inward-folding book-style 7.8-inch display with virtually no crease, a 5.5-inch outer display, a titanium chassis, a durable hinge with Liquid Metal, two rear cameras, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> instead of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jpmorgan/">JPMorgan</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/29/foldable-iphone-to-launch-in-september-2026/">JPMorgan: Foldable iPhone to Launch in September 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jpmorgan-foldable-iphone-to-launch-in-september-2026.2462391/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
