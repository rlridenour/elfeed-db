<p>As a Superhuman user, my first reaction <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/grammarly-acquires-ai-email-client-superhuman/">to this news</a> was, <em>“uh oh”. </em></p>



<p>What makes Superhuman so valuable to me as a user is the company&#8217;s obsession with email optimization. If they just become another cog in the wheel of Grammarly, I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;ll keep that up. </p>



<p>However, since then, I&#8217;ve been reading the press release and even the email from Superhuman&#8217;s founder, Rahul Vohra. It appears that this acquisition was made to accelerate Superhuman’s feature list, rather than impede it. I’ve got my fingers crossed that this turns out to be a good thing for users.</p>
