<p><em>&ldquo;Git submodules? hmmm, sure ok, we&rsquo;ll figure it out..&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>[Proceeds to break website and spend the rest of the day trying to get it back to some kind of working order]</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve changed up my blog theme but woah..holy shit.. it&rsquo;s taken some hours. When building <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> sites the suggested method to install themes is often to use Git submodules.. yeah?.. no?.. no idea. Git stuff stresses me out, I usually stumble through these kind of things following some online documentation.</p>
<p>The idea was that I wanted to really strip down my website to look a lot more like these minimalist Bear blogs that I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of recently.</p>
<p>Why not just use <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear</a> itself?.. well I did consider it. My main issue there is that you have to write posts in the browser window. For extra features you&rsquo;ll end up wanting, it becomes a paid subscription service. I like to have the control and to be able to customize every aspect of the site. I want to use my own offline editor to modify the code and write posts in my own writing environment.</p>
<p>Thankfully there is a very nice implementation of the Bear theme by <a href="https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog">janrassch</a>. I followed instructions to get this set up for Hugo. I copied my pre-existing posts and images across and everything was seemingly up and running nicely.. for a short while at least.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure what happened honestly, but at some point I messed things up badly pushing stuff with git. Skill issue I&rsquo;m sure, but I got to a point where the site wouldn&rsquo;t build and deploy through <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and I had no idea how to fix it. It was something to do with tinkering on stuff in the submodule which I now had no idea how to remove.</p>
<p>I used this breakage as an opportunity to generate a fresh directory and Hugo site/Git repo. Turns out this was a good idea. My previous theme was somewhat out of date and would throw errors when you started the server on localhost.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t too difficult to get something fresh up and running, push the repo, connect to Netlify and then link to my custom domain name. A lot of the settings were already in there from the previous build. I opted <em>not</em> to use the submodule approach this time and just straight clone the theme. I will have to keep track of any major changes but it&rsquo;s given me a good base to work on.</p>
<p>One nice perk to using this theme is that you should see it in light mode/dark mode depending on your system/browser settings. There&rsquo;s definitely some things to do that I&rsquo;m chipping away at. I still don&rsquo;t know how these posts are going to appear in an RSS reader? I want it to show the full posts rather than summaries, pushing this will test that out. I&rsquo;d like to use a custom font and I will be reviewing some past posts and cleaning up a bit. This feels like a fresh start. I&rsquo;d like to do more off the top of the head writing, try to keep things reasonably short form and regular.</p>
