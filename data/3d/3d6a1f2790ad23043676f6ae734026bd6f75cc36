<p>Families of two Trinidadian men killed in a U.S. strike on a boat near Venezuela have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the Trump administration, saying the men were civilians and that the operation violated U.S. and international law. The case puts a spotlight on the administration’s maritime counter-drug campaign and its legal justification for using lethal force against suspected smuggling vessels at sea. Beyond seeking accountability for the deaths, the suit could help clarify the rules governing U.S. military action in the Caribbean—an outcome both supporters and critics say is needed for future operations and civilian protection.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/nVujH4aHtSBSloGcLS0uegzzwTauU-nY5syFtsyhSM-fvOSzJWvhJKh3-v_Uv8me6LL14gBHyS8xMZ5tlr5OIe7TCHFmj39FoGP4EIGxcUp0n2p5f1TmJ9HzHfV00wUsjBsHtYA-xRljq39wpUiUN5SloJhjs1S7tVc4AzKqaXTqoOTVt7v6CWgLuGngg-Yl' alt='A memorial in Las Cuevas, Trinidad and Tobago, for Chad Joseph, one of two Trinidadian men killed in the boat strike.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Legal argument: The complaint characterizes the killings as “premeditated and intentional” and alleges there was no plausible legal justification for the strike.</li><li>Where it happened: The strike targeted a suspected drug boat off Venezuela’s coast in the Caribbean, according to the articles describing the incident and suit.</li><li>Policy test: The lawsuit directly challenges the Trump administration’s claim that lethal actions against people suspected of maritime drug smuggling have been lawful.</li><li>Families’ goal: Relatives say they are pursuing the case to obtain accountability through the U.S. court system after the deaths of the two men.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Families of the men: They argue the two men were wrongfully killed and that the strike violated legal limits on U.S. use of force at sea.
