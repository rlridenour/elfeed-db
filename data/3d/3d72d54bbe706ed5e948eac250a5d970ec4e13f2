<p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado handed her 2025 Nobel Peace Prize medal to President Donald Trump during a White House meeting, saying she did so on behalf of Venezuelans and because she believes he “deserves it”. The Nobel institution responded that while a medal can change hands, the Nobel Peace Prize title and historical record remain “inseparably” linked to the original laureate. The gesture landed in the middle of fast-moving Venezuela politics after a U.S. raid captured President Nicolás Maduro and brought him to the United States to face narco-trafficking charges, raising questions about how (and by whom) Venezuela will be governed next.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/g9ALpzYb3r__U1eL-BYbrQFiMvoYFe5SYbrKWSUwbHjLOAXTi5C0IMs091fVRqQYXyD_nUHUooubqbrgPVR9RZnZ72qcLigj3eLZq8aABkX66ximPrAHhP8kobubK-pYEQF45Ne9CveD5GHvK1QxKg8JM5hvfcrRMhenB-SJLx50dxcrqDlEppHSneOlKbHJQWs' alt='María Corina Machado’s decision to present her Nobel Peace Prize medal to President Trump has drawn mixed reactions.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Norway pushback: Politicians in Norway criticized the handover, prompting a pointed Nobel Committee clarification that the laureate and prize are inseparable even if the medal, diploma, or prize money later ends up elsewhere.</li><li>Trump’s rationale: Asked about accepting the medal, President Trump argued he had “ended 8 wars,” framing the moment as recognition of his peace efforts.</li><li>Machado’s pitch: After the meeting, Machado said an “orderly transition” would make Venezuela “the best ally the United States has ever had,” and she framed the choice for Washington as “between the cartel and justice,” not between specific politicians.</li><li>Interim governance: Despite Machado’s democracy message, Trump has backed interim President Delcy Rodríguez and other former Maduro loyalists as a short-term governing option that officials describe as the most stable path to maintain order and cooperate on energy priorities.</li><li>Not first medal: Nobel medals have been donated, sold, or offered for sale by past winners or their families, even though the Nobel Prize itself is not transferable.</li></ul><blockquote>Venezuela is going to be free - María Corina Machado</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>María Corina Machado: She says gifting the medal recognizes Trump’s commitment to Venezuela’s freedom and signals the start of a difficult but “orderly transition” toward democracy and elections, with Venezuela aiming to become a close U.S. ally.
