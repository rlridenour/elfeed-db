<p>The U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday adopted a resolution establishing an independent fact‑finding mission to investigate reported mass killings and sexual violence in El Fasher, North Darfur, after the Rapid Support Forces seized the city last month. The council held an emergency special session to press for urgent evidence‑gathering and international attention to allegations of war crimes and other abuses. The mission is intended to document allegations and collect material that could inform accountability measures, though the council did not publish details on leadership or a reporting timeline in the initial resolution.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gfTzYXLRL2wPv1HFX5XYnKy7SXKjLkDBcyDbcD-kLaKVw8W5_3Zkb3voH-_RS_6_5-NKS-VFGpZmh4CySk7w06-xJB6sfMCoHPutVEU1ILmr-Nxyb941woYmcBAsrvra4j9uTxwOQnSVIpBgq2wHVEwy5sgVaceIICJwV5RKG2HciFmxieBDLp404DQLKA' alt='Displaced Sudanese from El Fasher and other areas in Al Dabbah, Northern State, pictured Thursday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Mission mandate: The resolution creates an independent international fact‑finding team charged with investigating alleged war crimes and gathering evidence in El Fasher for possible accountability steps</li><li>Hospital allegations: Briefers at the session highlighted allegations that hundreds were killed at a Darfur hospital and described widespread sexual violence reported by survivors and aid workers</li><li>Evidence use: Council members said the mission will compile documentation that could be used by U.N. bodies or courts to pursue accountability, though concrete referral paths were not specified in the session records</li><li>Regional spillover: Separate reporting noted related regional tensions: South African intelligence has opened an inquiry into a chartered plane that landed with more than 150 Palestinians, underlining broader diplomatic sensitivities in the region</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United Nations Human Rights Council: The council adopted a resolution establishing an independent fact‑finding mission to investigate reported mass killings and other alleged war crimes in El Fasher.
