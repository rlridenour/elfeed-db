<p id="p1">Last June at WWDC, Apple announced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/102/?time=1438" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift Assist</a>, a way to generate Swift code using natural language prompts. However, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/apple-announced-swift-assist-wwdc24-so-where-is-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Tim Hardwick writes for MacRumors</a>, Swift Assist hasn&rsquo;t been heard from since then:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  Unlike Apple Intelligence, Swift Assist never appeared in beta. Apple hasn&rsquo;t announced that it&rsquo;s been delayed or cancelled. The company has since released Xcode 16.3 beta 2, and as&nbsp;<a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/03/12/whither-swift-assist/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Tsai points out</a>, it&rsquo;s not even mentioned in the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-16_3-release-notes" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p3">Meanwhile, developers have moved on, adopting services like <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cursor</a>, which does much of what was promised with Swift Assist, <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/watch-me-write-a-task-manager-in-30-minutes/" rel="noopener noreferrer">if not more</a>. A similar tool built specifically for Swift projects and Apple&rsquo;s APIs would be a great addition to Xcode, but it&rsquo;s been nine months, and developers haven&rsquo;t heard anything more about Swift Assist. Apple owes them an update.</p>
