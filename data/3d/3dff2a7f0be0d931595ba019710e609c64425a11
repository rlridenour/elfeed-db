<p>Today I decided to port my <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-hide-opinion/">Firefox extension</a> to Google Chrome.</p>
<p>Meet <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-hide-opinion/kmagnigdjocidngajmobbifcngjoejkm">Youtube Hide Opinion For Chrome</a>.</p>
<p>Turned out, I should change nothing in the extension to make it
working in Google Chrome (thanks to <a href="https://browserext.github.io/browserext/">Browser Extensions specification</a>)</p>
<p>Now to kill the good feeling I have to say that to publish
the extension to WebStore I had to make $5 one-time payment.
Pretty symbolic payment but still feels foreign while publishing open source code.</p>
