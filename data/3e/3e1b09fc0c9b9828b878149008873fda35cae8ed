<p>Thou shalt have one God only; who<br />
Would be at the expense of two?<br />
No graven images may be<br />
Worshipped, except the currency;<br />
Swear not at all; for, for thy curse<br />
Thine enemy is none the worse:<br />
At church on Sunday to attend<br />
Will serve to keep the world thy friend:<br />
Honour thy parents; that is, all<br />
From whom advancement may befall;<br />
Thou shalt not kill; but need&#8217;st not strive<br />
Officiously to keep alive:<br />
Do not adultery commit;<br />
Advantage rarely comes of it:<br />
Thou shalt not steal; an empty feat,<br />
When it&#8217;s so lucrative to cheat:<br />
Bear not false witness; let the lie<br />
Have time on its own wings to fly.<br />
Thou shalt not covet, but tradition<br />
Approves all forms of competition.</p>
<p>&#8212; Arthur Hugh Clough (1819-1861)</p>
