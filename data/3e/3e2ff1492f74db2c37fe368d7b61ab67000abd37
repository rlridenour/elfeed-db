</ul><h1>Awww, Cute!</h1><p>What do we have here?</p>
<p>Three-packs of beverage insulators. Except, like, they’re really cute. Because they look like jackets or funny shirts or hoodies or sleeping bags or…</p>
<p>Well, just scroll through the photos.</p>
<p>See those?</p>
<p>That’s what they look like.</p>
<p>Funny, right? Dressing up your drinks to keep them cool! And we say, why stop there? Don’t just give your drinks clothing. Give them entire personalities, too.</p>
<p>Here, we’ll start with a few ideas of our own:</p>
<p><strong>Jack and Coke</strong></p>
<p>Wears a bowler hat and says, “I’m going to go out for a smoke,” before theatrically taking out a pipe and a bag of tobacco, and it’s just like, ugh, seriously, who do they think they’re fooling with that whole act?</p>
<p><strong>Seltzer</strong></p>
<p>Understated and monotone in a way that makes it hard to tell if they’re flexing their subtle wit or if they’re just a bit vapid.</p>
<p><strong>Sparkline Rosé</strong></p>
<p>Lives in a house with a living room and a sitting room, and if you call the sitting room the living room, you can say goodbye to your inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>Hazy IPA</strong></p>
<p>You could’ve sworn they used to say they hated “Creep”-era Radiohead, espousing praise for their later, more experimental work instead. Only, now that this opinion is basically ubiquitous, they’ve been claiming that, actually, “Creep” is the band’s best song as it’s the one where Thom Yorke feels most “sonically at ease.”</p>
<p><strong>Margarita</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of happy hour, they order a few apps for the table to loosen things up. But then, they leave early, paying only for two of their four drinks.</p>
<p><strong>Hard seltzer</strong></p>
<p>Went to Napoli on vacation and said the best pizza they had the whole trip was when they ate Sbarro in O’Hare.</p>
<p><strong>Can of coffee-flavored energy drink</strong></p>
<p>Has intelligent eyes, enunciates, and uses big words with ease, but every time you walk past their desk, they’re scrolling Barstool Sports.</p>
<p><strong>Old-fashioned</strong></p>
<p>Wears a bowler hat and says, “I’m going to go out for a smoke,” before theatrically taking out a pipe and a bag of tobacco, and it’s just like, wow, such an archaic approach to our modern world and yet so authentic!</p>
<p><strong>Moscato</strong></p>
<p>Lives in a house with a living room and a sitting room, and there’s a 90-inch TV in each of them.</p>
<p><strong>Four Loko</strong></p>
<p>Started talking to you about chemtrails one day at the bar, and, because you didn’t want to get into an argument, you were like, “Yeah, totally.” But now the emails and texts are really piling up, and you’re afraid to click on any of those links lest you end up on some kind of watch list.</p>

<p>Those are our ideas. Now, share some beverage personalities of your own in the comments. Oh, and buy some goofy beverage coolers that look like clothing! They’re cute, right?</p>
