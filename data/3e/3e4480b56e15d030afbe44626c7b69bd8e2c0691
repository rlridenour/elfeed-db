<p>With a handful of apps on the App Store, I like to keep an eye on their rankings and user reviews from around the world. I don't need much. Just a quick glance.</p>
<p>A few of weeks ago, it just dawned on me that my Mac's status bar is likely the perfect place to keep this glanceable information handy. And with that, I built Ranking Officer. A little utility to do just that.</p>

<p>I wasn't too sure if this app would make it to the App Store. To my delight, Apple reviewed and accepted on its first submission.</p>
<p>As of today, you can install Ranking Officer from the App Store.</p>
