<p>Two years ago I embarked on a challenge: to only access my digital notes with TextEdit and iA Writer on my Mac. No Obsidian allowed. It was a revealing, disorienting, enlightening, frustrating experience! The things I learned during that experiment have stayed with me, and still influence the way I structure my notes today.</p>
<p>Two days ago I decided to revisit the #plainTextExperiment by temporarily putting Obsidian away again. What happened next taught me an important lesson about interoperability that I hadn’t picked up the first time around.</p>
<p>First, I’m going to explain what plain text productivity is, and how it can be approached in three different (sometimes interchangeable) ways.</p>
<h3 id="the-3-levels-of-plain-text-productivity">The 3 Levels of Plain Text Productivity</h3>
<p>Plain text productivity is the practice of organising one’s time, projects, and tasks with nothing but a series of text files. It can be undertaken at varying levels of complexity, which fall under three broad levels.</p>
<p><strong>Level one</strong> is raw text only, with zero links or formatting.</p>
<p><strong>Level two</strong> can include wiki links, Markdown, emojis. Things that work in many Markdown apps.</p>
<p><strong>Level three</strong> introduces features that give plain text super powers, but require specific apps like Obsidian, or Emacs and Org mode to activate them.</p>
<p>I like to spend most of my time at level two, with occasional forays into level three just for fun. When that feels overwhelming (and it always does, after a while), I dive back into level one as a reset. My files are intentionally structured to be able to use whichever one fits my mood on any given day.</p>
<h3 id="the-plain-text-experiment-round-2-markedit">The Plain Text Experiment, round 2: MarkEdit</h3>
<p>I chose MarkEdit to access my files during round two of the plain text experiment. MarkEdit is a free, open source text editor made for Markdown files. It’s vastly more basic than Obsidian, but still a significant step up from the plain text capabilities of TextEdit.</p>
<p>It’s a fun app to use, and on the whole I found I could work very well in it.</p>
<h3 id="things-that-didnt-work">Things that didn’t work</h3>
<p>The biggest issue was with my flashcards; they were usable but review sessions took longer. <span class="small-caps">HTML</span> embedded audio files work in MarkEdit, so the <code>![[wikilink]]</code> formatted audio I’d been using in Obsidian was useless. I’d do the conversion if MarkEdit became my home base, but for this experiment I ignored them and just focused on the text.<a href="#footnote-1ZPD" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1ZPD" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I noticed that after a couple of review sessions,<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>cards’ had blank lines between them that weren’t there before. Slightly annoying, but not a real problem.</p>
<p>My Task Dashboard, being a collection of wikilinks and queries, didn’t work at all in MarkEdit. It’s a good example of level three: useful in Obsidian, but nowhere else.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-in-interoperability">Lessons in Interoperability</h3>
<p>Files that are interoperable can be used for their intended purpose in any text editor (or at least a wide range of them).</p>
<p>On that criteria, I get almost full marks.</p>
<h3 id="relax-and-just-mindfully-enjoy-that-app">Relax, and just (mindfully) enjoy that&nbsp;app</h3>
<p>The thing I’ve come to understand since round 1 of the plain text experiment is that it’s okay to tailor your workflow around the capabilities and conveniences of a preferred app, so long as the files remain accessible and usable by other text editors.</p>
<p>That may seem obvious to you, but it was an important thing for me to learn.</p>
<p>You see, I had spent years trying to be the equivalent of a people-pleaser, but with apps! The first can’t be done (you’ll never please all the people all of the time), and the second doesn’t need to be (it’s okay to use non-essential features that work in some places but not in others).</p>
<h3 id="balance-simplicity-with-convenience">Balance simplicity with convenience</h3>
<p>Round one of the plain text experiment showed me where my dependencies lay. I was relying on an Obsidian plugin for my flashcards and for task management. No app, no dice. Now, both tasks and flashcards work nicely in any text editor that allows folding of sections.</p>
<p>Round two of the experiment reminded me that while I can get by living on the barest bones of plain text files, I don’t have to. I can enjoy the convenience of wikilinks and embedded queries while they’re available to me.</p>
<p>Plain text productivity level two is my sweet spot for tracking time, tasks, and notes. If Obsidian disappeared tomorrow I could continue on with my work in any number of apps, including iA Writer, MarkEdit, Logseq, Joplin, Tangent Notes, Notenik, and others. With a few app-specific tweaks, of course.</p>

<li id="footnote-1ZPD"><p>My flashcards consist of information presented as an outline, with answers indented underneath the questions, in a single file. When all sections are folded, only the questions can be seen. Basic metadata and a simple Leitner box schedule take care of spaced repetition.
