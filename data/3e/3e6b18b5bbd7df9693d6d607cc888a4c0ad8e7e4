<p>Which philosopher has a species of extinct horned armadillo named for him?<span id="more-54731"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an illustration of the creature, in case you&#8217;d like to see one:</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a hint: you might, because of the ears, be leaning towards Schopenhauer, and I can see that&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;but that&#8217;s not correct.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another hint: fossils of the armadillo were discovered in Argentina and Chile, places the philosopher for whom it is named never visited.</p>
<p>That narrows it down, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re on the cusp of guessing.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another hint of questionable value: this philosopher also has a species of extinct wasp named for him.</p>
<p>The only known fossils of this wasp were found trapped in amber. Here&#8217;s a photo:</p>

<p>Got it yet?</p>
<p>OK, to prevent this post from moving from &#8220;maybe amusing&#8221; to &#8220;definitely annoying,&#8221; here is a hint that may actually be of use: the wasp fossil was found in Kaliningrad.</p>
<p>Obviously I needn&#8217;t say more.</p>
<p>Though I suppose I should tell you the names of the species. The armadillo is <i>Epipeltephilus</i> <em>kanti</em> and the wasp is <em>Palaeorhoptrocentrus kanti</em>.</p>
<p>To see images of the philosopher these animals were named for, see <a href="https://dailynous.com/2019/12/20/thats-not-kant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What other types of animals are named for philosophers?</strong></p>
<p>This post was prompted by a recent <a href="https://lithub.com/turns-out-there-are-a-lot-of-insects-named-after-writers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article at </a><em>LitHub </em>on insects named after writers. The author, James Folta, notes that a kind of bug was named for Diogenes, the Cretaceous lacewing larva <em>Hallucinochrysa diogenesi</em>, who &#8220;camouflaged itself by covering its body with debris.&#8221; But that&#8217;s the only philosopher included on his list.</p>
<p>But certainly there have been other animals named for philosophers. Let&#8217;s crowdsource this important trivia, folks. Tell us what you know.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/08/22/types-of-animals-named-for-philosophers/">Types of Animals Named for Philosophers</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
