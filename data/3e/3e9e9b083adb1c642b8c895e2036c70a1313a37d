<p>My thanks to Impending for sponsoring last week at DF to promote their new app, Walk the World. You surely know some of Impending’s other apps, like the innovative checklist/task app <a href="https://www.useclear.com/">Clear</a>. Walk the World turns your steps — your real-world activity — into a new kind of virtual globe-trotting adventure. </p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be cool to know you’ve walked the length of the Boston Marathon this past week? You can conquer iconic hikes and trails from around the world presented as gorgeous map milestones to complete with your hard earned steps. It’s a genuinely novel idea for gamifying activity, executed with an exquisite attention to detail and exuberant sense of joy. Walk the World isn’t quite a game, but it delivers game-like fun.</p>

<p>If you enjoy or aspire to go on walks more regularly, and beautiful indie apps with fun new twists, this is your new healthy addiction. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/walk-the-world-virtual-trails/id6743502929">Try Walk the World free today for your iPhone</a>.</p>
