<p>&#8220;What, again, is education? The <em>non-coercive</em> rearranging of desire.&#8221;<span id="more-53669"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s <a href="https://history.princeton.edu/people/d-graham-burnett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D. Graham Burnett</a>, professor of history at Princeton University, in an <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/will-the-humanities-survive-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> in <em>The New Yorker </em>that you should read.</p>
<p>In the article, Burnett, whose area is history of science and who has focused quite a bit on the topic of attention, documents some of his experiments using large language models (LLMs) as research and teaching tools. In this post I&#8217;ll focus on the teaching side.</p>
<p>In one of his courses, &#8220;Attention and Modernity: Mind, Media, and the Senses&#8221;, he gave the students an assignment that had them make use of one of the LLMs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>An assignment in my class asked students to engage one of the new A.I. tools in a conversation about the history of attention. The idea was to let them take a topic that they now understood in some depth and explore what these systems could do with it. It was also a chance to confront the attention economy’s “killer app”: totally algorithmic pseudo-persons who are sensitive, competent, and infinitely patient; know everything about everyone; and will, of course, be turned to the business of extracting money from us. These systems promise a new mode of attention capture—what some are calling the “intimacy economy” (“human fracking” comes closer to the truth). The assignment was simple: have a conversation with a chatbot about the history of attention, edit the text down to four pages, and turn it in.</em></p>
<p>How did the students do? Burnett says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Reading the results, on my living-room couch, turned out to be the most profound experience of my teaching career. I’m not sure how to describe it. In a basic way, I felt I was watching a new kind of creature being born, and also watching a generation come face to face with that birth: an encounter with something part sibling, part rival, part careless child-god, part mechanomorphic shadow—an alien familiar.</em></p>
<p>He then proceeds to provide several examples of the truly fascinating work his students submitted. Seriously, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/will-the-humanities-survive-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the article</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s his takeaway from this &#8220;for those who are responsible for the humanistic tradition—those of us who serve as custodians of historical consciousness&#8221;? Those whose job is &#8220;helping others hold those artifacts and insights in their hands, however briefly, and of considering what ought to be reserved from the ever-sucking vortex of oblivion—and why&#8221;?</p>

<p>Adopting Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak&#8217;s definition of education as the &#8220;non-coercive rearranging of desire,&#8221; he sees an opportunity, and seems to accept that humanities education from here on in has to be different:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You can no longer make students do the reading or the writing. So what’s left? Only this: give them work they want to do. And help them want to do it. What, again, is education? The non-coercive rearranging of desire.</em></p>
<p>Oh&#8230; just that? Just give them work they want to do, and help them want to do it?</p>
<p>Um, hey, philosophers&#8212;have any of you tried doing this?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that? Only every semester since you started teaching?</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re good then?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Burnett&#8217;s sharing of his experiences teaching with AI is indeed interesting and helpful. But, right off the bat, we should be cautious about generalizing from them. After all, he is teaching Princeton students&#8230; at Princeton. In terms of intelligence, knowledge, motivation, environment, they are not representative of college students in the United States. That they are especially susceptible to help that gets them to want to do work their professor thinks is worthwhile&#8212;that there is academic work they want to do&#8212;does not tell us that much about the over 99% of US undergraduates not enrolled in Ivy League or otherwise elite institutions.</p>
<p>Burnett&#8217;s course seems to have had a rather small enrollment, which is necessary for the opportunities for (and expectations of) in-person discussion of the students&#8217; projects at a level sufficient to help incentivize hard work and deter fakery. And a light teaching load no doubt helps, too. What about lower level courses with enrollments in the 40- to 240-person range? And what about instructors teaching two or three or more other courses simultaneously? How common is it for instructors to have the time inside or outside of class to run such an assignment well?</p>
<p>I think that many academics who &#8220;give them work they want to do and help them want to do it&#8221; will be thinking, &#8220;yes, but&#8230;&#8221; What&#8217;s the but?</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;but students have all of the world&#8217;s entertainment and all of their friends with them at all times via devices that constantly remind them of this fact. In the flood of real and apparent fun, it is ever harder for professors to get a firm enough hold on their students&#8217; attention to help them want work.</li>
<li>&#8230;but many students seem to be in college merely for the degree, so they can then go off and get a job that degree qualifies them for. I suspect many were never adequately made aware that learning might have anything beyond the crudest instrumental value.</li>
<li>&#8230;but students are busy with various activities and many have jobs; even if they wanted to spend more time on schoolwork it&#8217;s not difficult to see how it would seem more rational to use the AI tools at their disposal to be more &#8220;efficient&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, maybe this is too much &#8220;easier said than done&#8221; and not enough creative brainstorming about the various ways to help various kinds of students at various kinds of institutions want to do some version of the work we think they should do. Your suggestions, as always, are welcome.</p>
<p>Burnett asks, about AI tools, &#8220;Do they herald the end of &#8216;the humanities&#8217;?&#8221; He answers: &#8220;In one sense, absolutely.&#8221; You know a &#8220;but&#8221; is coming, and indeed it does come, followed by the quote which began this post. Pessimistically, the meaning of &#8220;one sense&#8221; is &#8220;for most of you.&#8221; It would be nice to not be so pessimistic. Can you help?</p>
<p>I note that third stage of grief, &#8220;bargaining,&#8221; according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>, &#8220;involves the hope that the individual can avoid a cause of grief. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made in exchange for a reformed lifestyle.&#8221;</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/28/humanities-in-the-ai-era-is-this-the-bargaining-or-the-acceptance-stage/">Teaching Humanities in the AI Era: Is this the Bargaining or the Acceptance Stage?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
