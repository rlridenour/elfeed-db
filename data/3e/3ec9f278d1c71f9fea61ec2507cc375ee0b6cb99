<p>Jason Snell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After last year, Apple could’ve been forgiven for wanting to
soft-pedal this year’s Apple Intelligence announcements and
regroup. It didn’t do that, nor did it double down on last year.
Instead, it’s chosen a middle ground — a bit safe and familiar
but also a place where Apple can feel a bit more like itself. In
the long run, it needs to get this right. In the short term, maybe
it should focus on meeting its users where they are, rather than
pretending to be something it’s not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agree with Snell’s take completely, I do.</p>
