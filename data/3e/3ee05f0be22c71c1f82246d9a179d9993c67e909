<p>At least 30 news organizations — including The New York Times, The Associated Press, AFP and Fox News — declined to sign the Pentagon’s new press access policy by a Tuesday deadline [france24.com#1][ndtv.com#1][scmp.com#1]. The outlets say the rules could lead to less comprehensive coverage of the U.S. military and undermine First Amendment protections, with some describing the policy as a media crackdown [france24.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#1][dw.com#1]. The policy requires journalists to acknowledge they could be deemed security risks and lose Pentagon badges if they ask employees to disclose classified information and some other categories; outlets that refuse to sign risk losing credentials [scmp.com#1][ndtv.com#1]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has also limited unescorted access within the building and removed some reporters from long-established workspaces; despite Hegseth’s past ties to Fox News, the network joined other major broadcasters in rejecting the rules, while One America News Network said it would comply [theglobeandmail.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Mx7eM7XCCWdz2DYmGZ5NfUh8MiZTK7zta5SyB8hva76hXy67j_qUdJra0rXRW7YxGiiharHWaDwtCK-O3IyVaAdQNe9R-JbHJLuY0qvplp30OlUQwVTy-yyQAElpJAyQcRU-RCkdOkhKhu8ePoOZ0vJG_bcKFY_dfQIC7Q4LbCSCYtR9MTO7QGiDss4T8BgIPzu4tIM0yRcDFHs6tEpvrxuDrSpWYlWIt_Pmog89LywW78Rw6wVaHUOjZFFeJFAC5-Imbvr5sehqDOqpqg' alt='Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has limited unescorted access for reporters and removed some from long-established workspaces inside the Pentagon.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Broad participation: At least 30 outlets — including The New York Times, AP, AFP and Fox News — declined to sign by Tuesday’s deadline [france24.com#1][ndtv.com#1][scmp.com#1].</li><li>Key restrictions: The policy says reporters could be branded security risks and lose Pentagon badges if they ask employees to disclose classified information and some types of information [scmp.com#1].</li><li>Access changes: The Pentagon has restricted places reporters may go without escorts and removed some from long-standing workspaces in the building [theglobeandmail.com#1].</li><li>Credential stakes: Outlets that refuse to sign the policy face losing press access credentials, according to reporting on the rules [ndtv.com#1].</li><li>Free-press concerns: News organizations warned the rules could reduce comprehensive coverage and undermine press freedoms; some called it a media crackdown [france24.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#1][dw.com#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Major U.S. TV networks: ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and Fox News said they would not agree to the rules, calling the policy a threat to core journalistic protections.
