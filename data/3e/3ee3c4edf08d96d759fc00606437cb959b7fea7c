The PowerGrip includes a 9,300 mAh battery that can provide a full charge to Apple's iPhones. Included magnets allow it to attach to the back of a MagSafe-compatible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It can charge at 7.5W wirelessly, but plugging an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in with the included retractable USB-C cable speeds up charging. With the wireless charging capabilities, the included cable, and an extra USB-C port, up to three devices can be charged at one time. The charger is limited to 15W total, so it's best used to charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and smaller devices like an Apple Watch or AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
The PowerGrip connects to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; over Bluetooth, and a button on it can be used as a camera shutter button for snapping photos. It can be used in multiple orientations for filming, or it can serve as a stand. There's also a connector so it can be attached to a tripod mount. A digital display provides a readout on remaining capacity.<br/>
