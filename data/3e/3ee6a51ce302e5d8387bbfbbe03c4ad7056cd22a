<p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a wide-ranging phone call on February 4, covering trade, Taiwan, Iran, and Russia’s war in Ukraine. Trump publicly called the conversation “excellent” and said he looks forward to visiting Beijing in April. Several outlets cast the call as a sign both sides want to keep lines of communication open amid ongoing strategic competition, even as Washington urges other governments to distance themselves from Tehran. Taiwan quickly became a centerpiece of the public readouts. Xi urged the U.S. to be “prudent” or exercise “caution” on supplying arms to Taiwan, calling the issue central to China-U.S. relations. In Taipei, Taiwan’s president responded by saying ties with Washington remain strong, underscoring the island’s push for steady support and predictable diplomacy as cross-strait tensions persist. Trade also surfaced in concrete terms. Trump said China is considering buying more U.S.-grown soybeans, which some coverage highlighted as a tangible, if limited, sign that economic engagement continues alongside political disagreements.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JzSBbdi-RHAFio7Ci8KV5CD86z_OnfFGqvvR4fWJ68mhp1XZw-48onoLce_DWpxDk7KOuf2_7K323_9z1lAJd6zBnHaF4oGBlVnrAL53fCsZ' alt='US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping at a welcoming ceremony in Beijing (file photo).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Upcoming summits: Coverage noted both countries will host major summits in the coming year, which could create more chances for Trump and Xi to meet.</li><li>China’s tone and priorities: Beijing paired calls for “mutual respect” with a clear message that Taiwan is the “most important issue,” and it warned against U.S. arms sales to the island.</li><li>Iran emphasis: Some accounts put Iran near the top of the agenda, tying the discussion to Washington’s broader push for governments — including Beijing — to isolate Tehran.</li><li>Trade truce context: Semafor described the call as coming amid a months-old trade truce, suggesting that disputes over Taiwan, Iran, and Ukraine have not stopped economic engagement.</li><li>Readout timing: At least one report noted that China did not immediately issue a public readout, a reminder that the two sides often frame high-level contacts differently.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Chinese government (foreign ministry readout): China’s readout put the Taiwan question front and center and urged the U.S. to handle arms sales to Taiwan “with prudence.” (<a href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/05/xi-jinping-donald-trump-phone-call-china-us-taiwan-relationship'>The Guardian</a>)</li><li>Taiwan president: Taiwan’s president said ties with Washington are “rock solid,” after the Trump-Xi call touched on the island’s future.
