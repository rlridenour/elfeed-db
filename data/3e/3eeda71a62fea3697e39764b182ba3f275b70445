If you&rsquo;re one of those brave folks who doesn&rsquo;t mind browsing the Web from within Emacs, I just came across a package that may interest you. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/zhenhua-wang/emacs-websearch">emacs-websearch</a> a small utility that lets you specify a term, search for it on the web, choose one of the results, and open that page in your Emacs.

That may sound a little complicated but take a look at the animated GIF at the link. It seems like a pretty nice workflow. Right now, it supports Duck Duck Go and Google but looking at the code, it would be easy to add your favorite. You can choose between using the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Xwidgets.html">xwidget toolkit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework">eaf-open-browser</a> to display the Web page.

This is one of those small packages that mainly scratches the author&rsquo;s itch but can still be useful to the rest of us. Take a look and see if it might work for you.</p>
