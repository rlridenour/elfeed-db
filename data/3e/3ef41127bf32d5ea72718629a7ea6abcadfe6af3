<p>Apple’s OS betas are nearing completion, but not all betas for developers are OS Developer Betas: On Thursday Apple released <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26-release-notes">Xcode 26 beta 7</a>, which adds direct support for the new OpenAI GPT-5 model and lets users add existing paid Claude accounts to use Claude Sonnet 4:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Claude in Xcode is now available in the Intelligence settings panel, allowing users to seamlessly add their existing paid Claude account to Xcode and start using Claude Sonnet 4… When using ChatGPT in Xcode, users can now start a new conversation with either GPT-4.1 or GPT-5, with GPT-5 set as the default.</p>
<p>  ChatGPT in Xcode provides two model choices. “GPT-5” is optimized for quick, high-quality results, and should work well for most coding tasks. For difficult tasks, choose “GPT-5 (Reasoning)“, which spends more time thinking before responding, and can provide more accurate results for complex coding tasks.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the clever things about Xcode 26’s AI support is that if you want to bring your own model to the party, you can, and that’s no different in this beta: Xcode 26 supports API keys from other providers as well as the ability to run local models directly on their Apple silicon Macs.</p>
