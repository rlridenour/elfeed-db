Software engineer <a href="https://x.com/wongmjane/status/1932282217218400556">Jane Manchun Wong discovered</a> that iOS 26 can automatically fill in one-time verification codes from third-party apps, like Google Voice. The feature previously only worked with codes from Apple's Messages app on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
As noted by <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1932638639974207879"><em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris</a>, macOS Tahoe can automatically fill in one-time verification codes from the Messages app in Google Chrome and other third-party web browsers. The feature was previously limited to Safari on the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
These are two great quality-of-life improvements to this crowd-pleasing AutoFill feature.<br/>
