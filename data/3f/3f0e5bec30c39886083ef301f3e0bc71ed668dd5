<blockquote>
  <p>macOS Tahoe’s visual interface:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fits largely rectangular contents into windows with excessively
rounded corners.</li>
<li>Enlarges controls without any functional benefit.</li>
<li>Results in app icons being more uniform, thus less
distinguishable and memorable.</li>
<li>Fails to distinguish tools, controls and other interface
elements using differences in tone, so making them harder
to use.</li>
<li>Makes a mess where transparent layers are superimposed, and
won’t reduce transparency when that’s needed to render its
interface more accessible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe this is because I’m getting older, but that gives me the
benefit of having experienced Apple’s older interfaces, with their
exceptional quality and functionality.</p>

<p>It’s just remarkable how much better-looking MacOS was 10 years ago, compared to MacOS 26 Tahoe <em>at its best</em>. And it’s equally remarkable just how bad MacOS 26 Tahoe looks in many typical, non-contrived situations, where entire menus, search fields, and window titles are rendered completely illegible.</p>
