<p>A week after songwriter Jim Croce died in a plane crash in 1973, his wife, Ingrid Jacobson, received this letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear Ing,</p>
<p>I know I haven&#8217;t been very nice to you for some time, but I thought it might be of some comfort, Sweet Thing, to understand that you haven&#8217;t been the only recipient of JC&#8217;s manipulations. But since you can&#8217;t hear me and can&#8217;t see me, I can&#8217;t bullshit, using my sneaky logic and facial movements. I have to write it all down instead, which is lots more permanent. So it can be re-read instead of re-membered, so, it&#8217;s really right on the line.</p>
<p>I know that you see me for who I am, or should I say, as who I are. &#8216;Cause I&#8217;ve been lots of people. If Medusa had personalities or attitudes instead of snakes for her features, her name would have been Jim Croce. But that&#8217;s unfair to you and it&#8217;s also unhealthy for me. And I now want to be the oldest man around, a man with a face full of wrinkles and lots of wisdom.</p>
<p>So this is a birth note, Baby. And when I get back everything will be different. We&#8217;re gonna have a life together, Ing, I promise. I&#8217;m gonna concentrate on my health. I&#8217;m gonna become a public hermit. I&#8217;m gonna get my Master&#8217;s Degree. I&#8217;m gonna write short stories and movie scripts. Who knows, I might even get a tan.<br />
Give a kiss to my little man and tell him Daddy loves him.</p>
<p>Remember, it&#8217;s the first sixty years that count and I&#8217;ve got 30 to go.<br />
I Love you,<br />
Jim
</p></blockquote>
