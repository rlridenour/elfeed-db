<blockquote>
  <p>LLMs can write a large fraction of all the tedious code you’ll
ever need to write. And most code on most projects is tedious.
LLMs drastically reduce the number of things you’ll ever need to
Google. They look things up themselves. Most importantly, they
don’t get tired; they’re immune to inertia.</p>

<p>Think of anything you wanted to build but didn’t. You tried to
home in on some first steps. If you’d been in the limerent
phase of a new programming language, you’d have started
writing. But you weren’t, so you put it off, for a day, a year,
or your whole career.</p>

<p>I can feel my blood pressure rising thinking of all the
bookkeeping and Googling and dependency drama of a new project. An
LLM can be instructed to just figure all that shit out. Often, it
will drop you precisely at that golden moment where shit almost
works, and development means tweaking code and immediately seeing
things work better. That dopamine hit is why I code.</p>

<p>Ptacek says he mostly writes in Go and Python, and his essay doesn’t even mention Swift. But the whole essay is worth keeping in mind ahead of WWDC. There is no aspect of the AI revolution where Apple, right now today, is further behind than agentic LLM programming. (Swift Assist, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/apple-empowers-developers-and-fuels-innovation-with-new-tools-and-resources/">announced</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/15/swift-assist-voorhees">even demoed</a> last year at WWDC, would have been a first step in this direction, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/13/whither-swift-assist">but it never shipped</a>, even in beta.)</p>
