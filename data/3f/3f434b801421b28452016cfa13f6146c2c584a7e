<li>Amazing</li>
<li>Beautiful</li>
<li>Unbelievable</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: Yes, but only if you fold them just right (we’re not telling)</li>
</ul><h1>Swag</h1><p>Hey pal, nice shirt!</p>
<p>Am I a fan? Hell yeah, I am! M-E-H! Men Exuding Humility. They’re one of my favorite bands.</p>
<p>They were huge in Nashville when I was growing up there. Nashville, Indiana, I mean. Yeah, it’s not a very big town, but we had a booming college rock scene in the 80s. The only thing we were missing to really make it all come together was a venue. And also a college.</p>
<p>But Men Exuding Humility stood out even in that crowded field!</p>
<p>Really so rad to meet another fan out in the wild!</p>
<p>I was just telling my buddy about them the other day. We were talking about hair metal bands and prog groups with their ridiculous drum setups, and I mentioned how Dale Burns, percussionist for Men Exuding Humility, played a kit that consisted of only two high hats and a practice pad.</p>
<p>But man, he could really make those things sing, amirite?</p>
<p>And you’re not going to believe this: Cash Munson, the lead singer? He was my PE teacher! Crazy, right? That’s where the recurring theme of running laps comes from in their songwriting.</p>
<p>Like in “Laps around my Heart.” Or “All the Laps (Can’t Keep me from You).” Or “Running in Circles.”</p>
<p>Which is to say nothing about “Ducking and Dodging,” which was about dodgeball, and actually took its rhythm from the music we listened to during the mandatory square dancing unit.</p>
<p>And don’t get me started on the three-bass lineup. Hailey Henderson on lead bass, Jimmy Dell on rhythm bass, and Jill ‘the Chill’ Erickson on upright bass. Ahead of it’s time! Like, way ahead! Like, that time hasn’t even come yet!</p>
<p>Anyway, their stuff is super hard to find now, but I’ve got it all: official releases and bootlegs. And I can make copies for you if you want. Here, let me give you my number, it’s–</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So, it’s a deal site. That sells a lot of random stuff at steep discounts.</p>
<p>And you wear a shirt about that.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
