<p>As a general fan of easy links between file apps, I’m always interested in seeing how things are going with Hookmark, a ubiquitous linking app for your Mac. A frequent question I get about this app is whether or not the links will work on iPhone and iPad.</p>



<p>Sadly, the answer has been ‘no’, until now. CogSci Apps has released a companion mobile app <a href="https://hookproductivity.com/iphone-ipad/">called Hookmark Pal</a>, letting you access your Hookmark-created links on the go.</p>



<p>There is a caveat, though. Due to Apple restrictions, the application cannot access iCloud files. The team at HookMark is looking into ways around that, but even in its current implementation, this is a great tool if you&#8217;re already using Hookmark on your Mac.</p>
