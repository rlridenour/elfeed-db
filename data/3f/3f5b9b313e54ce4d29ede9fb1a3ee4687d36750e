<p>Russia says it launched a large overnight barrage on Ukraine that included the Oreshnik, a nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballistic missile, describing the strike as retaliation for an alleged Ukrainian drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin’s residences—an allegation Ukraine denies and the Trump administration says did not happen. Ukrainian officials reported deaths and injuries in Kyiv as drones and missiles hit the capital, while authorities in the western Lviv region said a critical infrastructure facility was struck near the EU and NATO border. The use of a nuclear-capable system was widely portrayed as a signal aimed at Ukraine and its Western partners, even as emergency services and repair crews worked to respond to damage in multiple regions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/xrUtB3FYGwB9uIt--Sz2GseJXFsnnOj8RIpujfFVHF2wOCKyiRla3_s8RPmqnQ5poI1J-M1kH0zIA46XDbv1bD19Bno63YcItQxA7Di8pxvXiuljCrJ659o3GO80EMPMpKpw23Eqlum_ct1lNu7gDiNYF07-lqnPJsALUMWc-kCcAsRU1DjC3zV1Pzm9izTwnVfa_yzVULb8-Kk4SdxOtLpGUno6_OgDVEYe2Vcopg1ZCi4P9qK0l5n6K-Gm7NYBo9Hfz_2YLy6vXODoTQ' alt='Ukrainian rescuers work to extinguish a fire in a heavily damaged residential building after Russian drone and missile attacks in Kyiv, January 9, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Target details: Russian media reported the Oreshnik hit a large underground natural-gas storage site in Ukraine’s western Lviv region, while local officials described the impact as damage to critical infrastructure.</li><li>Double-tap claim: Euronews reported that in Kyiv, rescuers and paramedics responding to an initial strike were hit in a follow-up “double-tap” attack, adding to the danger for first responders.</li><li>Diplomatic sites: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Qatari embassy was struck in the Kyiv attack, and Firstpost noted that multiple diplomatic missions in Kyiv have been hit over the course of the war.</li><li>European security: Ukraine’s foreign minister said the strike near the EU and NATO border posed a grave threat to wider European security and called for stronger allied responses.</li><li>Peacekeeping dispute: France 24 reported the latest attack followed Russia’s rejection of a proposed post-war peacekeeping plan discussed by Ukraine and its Western partners.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Russian Defense Ministry: Moscow said it used long-range precision weapons including the Oreshnik and framed the strike as retaliation for an alleged drone attack on Putin’s residence.
