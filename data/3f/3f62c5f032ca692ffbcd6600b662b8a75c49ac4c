Apple's long-rumored foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> may cost less to manufacture than previously expected thanks to major reductions in hinge component pricing, according to analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.<br/>

In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/mnbyfW1xgQZ5ia">new report</a>, Kuo said that the hinge designed for Apple's foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is expected to carry an average selling price (ASP) of approximately &#36;70 to &#36;80 when mass production begins, well below the market expectation of &#36;100 to &#36;120 or higher. Kuo attributed the cost decline not to cheaper materials, but to "assembly design optimization" and Foxconn's influence in production scaling.<br/>
<br/>
Foxconn has reportedly entered a joint venture with Taiwanese hinge maker Shin Zu Shing (SZS) to take on the majority of Apple's hinge orders. The new venture has secured about 65% of total orders, while U.S.-based Amphenol is expected to supply the remaining 35%. Kuo said that Foxconn holds a slightly larger stake in the partnership and is "steering future direction."<br/>
<br/>
The expected drop in hinge pricing could significantly benefit Apple. Foldable smartphones are notoriously expensive to produce, with complex hinge designs adding both mechanical and financial challenges. A hinge ASP reduction of &#36;20 to &#36;40 compared to expectations could improve Apple's margins or enable more aggressive pricing to compete with established players such as Samsung and Huawei.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo also suggested that Luxshare-ICT, one of Apple's fastest-growing manufacturing partners, could become an additional hinge supplier after 2027. With further competition, hinge costs could drop even lower. <br/>
<br/>
The hinge mechanism is a critical component in any foldable device, determining both the reliability of the screen's movement and the long-term durability of the product. Designs under consideration have reportedly ranged from stainless steel and Liquid Metal hinges to lighter aluminum and titanium frames similar to that of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Whether the reduction in hinge price will reduce retail price or simply bolster Apple's margins is an open question. The company's first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is expected to launch in the fall of 2026, alongside the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; 2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro, and &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/">Foxconn</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/13/foldable-iphone-could-be-cheaper-than-expected/">Apple&#039;s Foldable iPhone Could Be Cheaper Than Expected</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-foldable-iphone-could-be-cheaper-than-expected.2469015/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
