<p>When I <a href="https://taonaw.com/2026/01/21/denote-on-emacs-is-the.html">mentioned</a> Denote again a couple of days ago, Omar commented that whenever someone mentions using Denote or org-roam, he&rsquo;s curious to know if that person tried vanilla org-mode first, without additional packages.</p>
<p>I get it. After all, I&rsquo;ve been resisting the whole Zettelkasten bandwagon and org-roam with it for a while, keeping the same opinion about org-roam Omar seems to have about Denote (I&rsquo;m speculating here, of course). In general, I don&rsquo;t like the idea of Doom Emacs or Spacemacs for the same reasons. Denote, for some reason, never registered this way. I liked it from day one.</p>
<p>As I was answering his question and he asked for more details, I thought it might make a good post. So here we are.</p>
<p>Not a whole lot changed for me since I first <a href="https://taonaw.com/2023/07/17/looking-into-emacs.html">looked into Denote</a>. I still mostly use it for my blog posts (like the one you&rsquo;re reading right now) and my info notes, which mostly contain technical how-tos to myself and to a lesser degree, some records and memos, like a list of equipment in my home or who&rsquo;s who at work. At this point, I also have <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/07/31/denote-with-a-different-root.html">a third, personal folder with notes only on my Linux computer</a> as well, which mostly contain &ldquo;supplemental&rdquo; notes as I call them to journal entries I want to expand on in private (I use my work iPhone with Journelly, which does a fantastic job, but I don&rsquo;t trust Apple or any cloud service for that matter with my private stuff).</p>
<p>It has been slow progress, but I&rsquo;ve improved my usability with Denote, which I recently enhanced further after having the pleasure of talking to Prot 1:1 in one of his online tutoring sessions (always a pleasure, and highly recommended if you ask me).</p>
<p>The main philosophy behind Denote is something I&rsquo;ve been in agreement with for a long time, before I started using it, or Emacs, or even got familiar with Linux: the idea of how to date and rename files. I&rsquo;ve never agreed with the American way of writing dates, and I always prefer the ISO format: yyyymmdd followed by hhmm. To me, this is how things should be organized. So when Denote came around with Prot explaining that this is how he sees files should be organized - date, followed by keywords, and then a title - it just clicked.</p>
<p>You can extend this file-naming scheme to all your personal files if you&rsquo;d like (at least all the files you visit with Dired), and I&rsquo;m in the process of doing exactly that. Because the renaming function is built into Denote, it&rsquo;s easy to stay concise and avoid mistakes (for example, renaming one file 20260124 something, and then another 2026124, emitting the 0 for January). While it&rsquo;s true you could easily do that without Denote, to me, this core piece was like a sign that said, &ldquo;Hey, look at this, this guy is building a package that is based on something that makes sense, check it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tags are another important part of Denote. Org-mode has tags built into headers, which works, but the headers, to me, are a bit too specific to need them. For the most part, I can get the level of information I need through the header itself, and I use tags to associate a certain header with a person - but even that is not useful, as I often work with too many people for the tags to really mean anything. Meanwhile, it&rsquo;s the files themselves that need tags: certain workflows are similar, but are tagged to work for different operating systems (say, how to set my work VPN on Linux vs on my Mac), or maybe I have a naming convention for different departments at work, and I want to tag the relevant departments.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t always break my different workflows and notes into files. In the past, I had one org file as a wiki: a single file with many headers explaining workflows and procedures. I often had errors there. It was one big file that I often opened and edited, so I had syncing issues, headers that got mixed up, etc. The other problem I had with the wiki was logical: at times, a certain subheader would fit under two different headers, and I would have a hard time deciding where to place something. Headers work as categories, while tags work as ,well, tags. If we take the VPN example from before, I could put my VPN instructions under &ldquo;networking,&rdquo; &ldquo;security,&rdquo; or &ldquo;remote work,&rdquo; but not all. I don&rsquo;t have this problem with Denote.</p>
<p>Another, more recent skill I started using with Denote is its metadata and search features. Meta notes work as an index of other files, where I can have one file with a dynamic list (updated whenever the file is loaded) of live links to other files with the same tag or other regex I use. Meanwhile, searching with Denote using <code>denote-grep</code> (something I learned recently) shows a list of all the files matching my search in collapsible form, making it easy to find what I need. I can use one of many <code>denote-query</code> forms to filter those results even further, and of course, there&rsquo;s <code>denote-consult</code>, which, well, if you know consult, you know what it does, and it&rsquo;s excellent.</p>
<p>Finding stuff is a central issue for anyone keeping notes, no matter what system they use. Denote supplies me with the best tools I&rsquo;ve seen for this job. It&rsquo;s true that many of these tools are already available in Emacs and in org-mode. Denote doesn&rsquo;t alter these existing options; rather, it builds on them. In fact, that&rsquo;s a big part of Denote: the way its commands are constructed borrows from what Emacs already does, so if you&rsquo;re familiar with one, you intuitively know what the same thing would do inside Denote.</p>
<p>Another example of the above is the org files you create with Denote. You can use Denote directly with a capture template, and each file is created with file tags that make sense if you use org-mode: <code>#-title</code>, <code>#+date</code> and <code>#+filetags</code>, which denote changes automatically as you rename files with it. These work together with additional options I include in my notes, such as <code>#+STARTUP: inlineimages</code>. In a Markdown export, such as this very post you&rsquo;re reading now, Emacs knows to ignore these org-mode only options, so I don&rsquo;t need to clean them out when I&rsquo;m ready to post. It&rsquo;s a nice touch that already exists in vanilla org-mode, but with the added benefits of Denote, like having my post tagged, dated, and easily found in a search alongside the rest of my Denote files in the future.</p>
<p>There are definitely more features of Denote I don&rsquo;t use, or use enough (blacklinks, which I believe are more of a recent introduction, is one of them), but as I stated above, this is a process. I learn more every week, and as my notes collection increases, so does my understanding of how to use Denote in a way that works for me.</p>
