<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned before that what I really wanted out of my career was to be a consultant, especially in automation and efficiency on Mac and iOS, for teams and small-to-medium size businesses looking to grow. Well, I&rsquo;m excited to have teamed up with Christopher Gamblée-Wallendjack to create <a href="https://bearandglass.co">Bear &amp; Glass</a>.</p>

<p>We want to take what we normally do for individuals one-on-one and bring it to teams. I&rsquo;m excited to be launching this!</p>

<p>Bear &amp; Glass will make the work I do and the things I create accessible to people that might never have found me on their own &mdash; creative teams who need someone who speaks both human and machine. When one person decides what &ldquo;clever&rdquo; tool the whole company will use, it rarely works. If the needs of the people actually using the tools aren&rsquo;t heard, they won&rsquo;t use them &mdash; and everyone&rsquo;s right back where they started. That&rsquo;s why Bear &amp; Glass will talk to everyone. We build systems and automations that make sense to the people who rely on them, and which connect perfectly to create the whole.</p>

<p>The automation possibilities are vast. We can do everything from
speeding up your email workflow to streamlining your publishing,
onboarding, and day-to-day operations. We provide stable, future-proof
automations that scale with your business. We specialize in Mac and iOS
automation, but we also do Unix automations and server-side operations.</p>

<p>Working with Christopher is the perfect pairing: I get to focus on the automation side, and Christopher, who specializes in customer service, documentation, and project management, gets to focus on the people.</p>

<p>So if you&rsquo;re someone who believes their team or business could be saving time, working more efficiently, or improving everything from onboarding to operations with our bespoke services, visit <a href="https://bearandglass.co">bearandglass.co</a> and contact us today! You&rsquo;ll get a personal response from Christopher, who can answer all of you questions!</p>
