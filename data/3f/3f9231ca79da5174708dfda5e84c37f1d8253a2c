<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. is “actively looking at” revamping the Safari web
browser on its devices to focus on AI-powered search engines, a
seismic shift for the industry hastened by the potential end of a
longtime partnership with Google.</p>

<p>Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, made the
disclosure Wednesday during his testimony in the US Justice
Department’s lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. The heart of the
dispute is the two companies’ estimated $20 billion-a-year deal
that makes Google the default offering for queries in Apple’s
browser. The case could force the tech giants to unwind the
pact, upending how the iPhone and other devices have long
operated.</p>

<p>Beyond that upheaval, AI is already making gains with consumers.
Cue noted that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last
month, which he attributed to people using AI. Cue said he
believes that AI search providers, including OpenAI, Perplexity AI
Inc. and Anthropic PBC, will eventually replace standard search
engines like Alphabet’s Google. He said he believes Apple will
bring those options to Safari in the future.</p>

<p>“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the
default,” he said, indicating that they still need to improve. Cue
specifically said the company has had some discussions with
Perplexity. “Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the
others were valid choices,” Cue said. “I think today there is much
greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the
problem in a different way.”</p>

<p>If they can pay, Apple will listen. And I don’t think it’s bullshit, at all, that traditional web search is actually going into decline now because of AI. Honestly at this point it would be weird if it weren’t.</p>

<p>But. Let’s say Apple would prefer for the current arrangement between Apple and Google to continue as is. But it’s under threat as a remedy in Google’s monopoly case. Is this not the perfect testimony? Traditional web search is in decline, usage-wise — and Apple is considering deals with multiple upstarts. I think it’s all true. But I also think it helps make the case that the current deal between Apple and Google should not be disallowed.</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s any bullshit here. I think we’re at a highly competitive moment between browsers and chatbots and between old-school search and new-school AI. And I think Eddy Cue is right in the middle of it.</p>

<p>Also, a really interesting nugget that, according to Cue, searches in Safari dropped last month for the first time ever.</p>
