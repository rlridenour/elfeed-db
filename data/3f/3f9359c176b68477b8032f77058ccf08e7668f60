It's been several months since Apple released the mid-tier <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> to replace the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> SE, so we thought we'd revisit it for a longer-term review.<br/>

With a starting price of &#36;599, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; isn't a low-cost smartphone, but it is Apple's most affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; option. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; has some of the same technology that's in Apple's flagship <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, so the price isn't bad for what it offers. You can often find deals that lower the price a little.<br/>
<br/>
It has the same A18 chip that's in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but with a 4-core GPU instead of a 5-core GPU. It's as blazing fast for day-to-day performance, and the only place you might notice that missing GPU core is playing system intensive games. It has the same amount of RAM and supports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>.<br/>
<br/>
You're limited to a single-lens camera, but it's Apple's 48-megapixel Fusion lens. You don't get ultra wide or 5x telephoto images, but it does support standard 26mm images and also 12-megapixel 2x telephoto images.<br/>
<br/>
At 6.1 inches, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is the same size as the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but it's a little lighter in weight because of the single-lens camera. It doesn't have 120Hz ProMotion or a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>. Those features are nice to have, but not essential. Another feature that you might miss more with the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a>. It's not clear why Apple didn't include &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, but it's limited to slower Qi-based charging.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to use Apple's 5G C1 modem rather than a Qualcomm modem, and in our testing, it works just as well as Qualcomm hardware. Performance can be even better than Qualcomm in some areas with low connectivity. Battery life is better than the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, thanks to efficiencies introduced by the C1 modem.<br/>
<br/>
There are some features you miss out on choosing the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; over the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but it's &#36;200 less and has a whole lot to offer.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/07/iphone-16e-four-month-review/">Video: Five Months With the iPhone 16e</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/video-five-months-with-the-iphone-16e.2462961/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
