<blockquote>
  <p>We are observing stealth crawling behavior from Perplexity, an
AI-powered answer engine. Although Perplexity initially crawls
from their declared user agent, when they are presented with a
network block, they appear to obscure their crawling identity in
an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences. We see
continued evidence that Perplexity is repeatedly modifying their
user agent and changing their source <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/">ASNs</a> to hide their
crawling activity, as well as ignoring — or sometimes failing to
even fetch — <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-robots-txt/">robots.txt</a> files.</p>

<p>The Internet as we have known it for the past three decades is
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content-independence-day-no-ai-crawl-without-compensation/">rapidly changing</a>, but one thing remains constant: it is
built on trust. There are clear preferences that crawlers should
be transparent, serve a clear purpose, perform a specific
activity, and, most importantly, follow website directives and
preferences. Based on Perplexity’s observed behavior, which is
incompatible with those preferences, we have de-listed them as a
verified bot and added heuristics to our managed rules that block
this stealth crawling. [...]</p>

<p>Our multiple test domains explicitly prohibited all automated
access by specifying in robots.txt and had specific WAF rules that
blocked crawling from <a href="https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots">Perplexity’s public crawlers</a>. We
observed that Perplexity uses not only their declared user-agent,
but also a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome
on macOS when their declared crawler was blocked.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/agents-or-bots-making-sense-of-ai-on-the-open-web">Perplexity has responded</a>, accusing Cloudflare of incompetence and publicity-seeking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because Cloudflare has conveniently obfuscated their methodology
and declined to answer questions helping our teams understand, we
can only narrow this down to two possible explanations.</p>

<ol>
<li>Cloudflare needed a clever publicity moment and we–their own
customer–happened to be a useful name to get them one.</li>
<li>Cloudflare fundamentally misattributed 3-6M daily requests from
BrowserBase’s automated browser service to Perplexity, a basic
traffic analysis failure that’s particularly embarrassing for a
company whose core business is understanding and categorizing
web traffic.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whichever explanation is the truth, the technical errors in
Cloudflare’s analysis aren’t just embarrassing — they’re
disqualifying. When you misattribute millions of requests, publish
completely inaccurate technical diagrams, and demonstrate a
fundamental misunderstanding of how modern AI assistants work,
you’ve forfeited any claim to expertise in this space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perplexity’s response makes it sound like Cloudflare just doesn’t get how leading-edge AI chatbots work, and what users expect of them. But going back to Cloudflare’s post, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives/">they specifically cite OpenAI</a> as an exemplar in respecting the directives of website publishers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we ran the same test as outlined above with ChatGPT, we found
that ChatGPT-User fetched the robots file and stopped crawling
when it was disallowed. We did not observe follow-up crawls from
any other user agents or third party bots. When we removed the
disallow directive from the robots entry, but presented ChatGPT
with a block page, they again stopped crawling, and we saw no
additional crawl attempts from other user agents. Both of these
demonstrate the appropriate response to website owner preferences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And nothing in Perplexity’s response attempts to explain Cloudflare’s accusation that Perplexity is adopting a false generic user-agent when their own declared user-agents are disallowed. Seems shifty to me.</p>
