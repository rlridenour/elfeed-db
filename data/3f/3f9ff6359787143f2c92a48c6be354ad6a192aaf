In a research note with investment firm GF Securities on Thursday, analyst Jeff Pu outlined the following upgrades for the iPhone 18 Pro models:<ul><br/>
  <li><strong>Smaller Dynamic Island:</strong> It has been rumored that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/iphone-18-pro-leak-smaller-dynamic-island/">Face ID's flood illuminator will be moved under the screen</a> on the iPhone 18 Pro models, paving the way for a smaller Dynamic Island on the devices.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Variable Aperture:</strong> The main 48-megapixel Fusion camera on both iPhone 18 Pro models is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/iphone-18-pro-rumored-camera-upgrade/">rumored to have a variable aperture</a>, which would allow users to control the amount of light that passes through the camera's lens and reaches the sensor. This would provide greater control over depth of field. However, given that iPhones have smaller image sensors due to smartphone size constraints, it is unclear exactly how meaningful this improvement would be.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>A20 Pro Chip:</strong> Apple's next-generation A20 Pro chip is expected to use TSMC's first-generation 2nm process, whereas the A19 Pro chip is 3nm. With a 2nm architecture and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/kuo-on-iphone-18-a20-chip-packaging/">a new packaging design</a>, the A20 Pro chip should deliver solid year-over-year performance and power efficiency gains.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>N2 Chip:</strong> All of the iPhone 17 and iPhone Air models are equipped with an Apple-designed N1 chip that enables Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Apple says the N1 chip also improves the overall performance and reliability of features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop. iPhone 18 Pro models are expected to have Apple's next-generation N2 chip, but is not yet known what improvements would come with this upgrade.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>C2 Modem:</strong> Apple's custom C1 cellular modem for 5G and LTE debuted in the iPhone 16e last year, and that was followed by a C1X chip in the iPhone Air. Apple says the C1X modem is up to twice as fast as the C1 modem, and the most power-efficient modem in an iPhone ever. The improvements should continue with Apple's third-generation C2 modem in the iPhone 18 Pro models.</li><br/>
</ul>These are only some of the new features and changes planned for the iPhone 18 Pro models, with additional ones outlined in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18 roundup</a>.<br/>
