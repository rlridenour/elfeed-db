<p>In Hong Kong’s Tai Po district, a massive fire that began on Wednesday at the Wang Fuk Court public housing estate has killed at least 55 people in the city’s deadliest blaze in roughly seven decades, while dozens remain in hospital and many residents are still unaccounted for. The fire started on external bamboo scaffolding surrounding one block under renovation, then rapidly spread to seven of the estate’s eight 31‑storey residential towers, helped by strong winds and flammable construction materials on the buildings’ exterior and around sealed lift windows. Hundreds of firefighters and more than a hundred fire engines have battled the blaze for over 24 hours and are still working to reach upper floors, where intense heat, falling scaffolding and thick smoke complicate rescue efforts. Police have arrested three employees from the renovation contractor on suspicion of manslaughter, alleging “grossly negligent” use of unsafe materials, and Hong Kong’s leader John Lee has ordered territory‑wide safety inspections of public housing undergoing major repairs while promising a full investigation and support for survivors.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RZSRCC8icBYHzMEPatzylzN2P_SJ0hpRqjpayDb7QejS0-oiXR-PcKlm2p7ldXZZw7uW5cIknq_Zl6F3NXUfSkM8yMaH9xkTfQC4KnnHbnap5T3ubXpa88CuqDptzyZsr__hRHcrLOo5V-lOH8OLB8T21TxLEGksmYTi0_4M8JnfonAfBsf4F18gP_cJQn7wTAMEkczLn2Y9Nxs2gV_3LgT4bEmqVjxZ3Q1u7Q7KWVU1jzDxXQGNDA4uF6j4MNcNzIykTjqNgCBFpPXhWhbh-CZqgt4mcQw7FD4dnjaUYwOqVzdSICyCbB_3o9HK25edVKoA-k9YVybmlu13WEWKTiKO0zQggrWPy_Ys-U0sSZjKprmNmguxlfjO4qBgF2GL-8KrCpkqZRQbhR1WKlO-tjErUTclUiK-K-F8iwuOShZoS_6M1NhggPOnpdWv0uC0Ru5aiIW3T_wqkCOs7PHzPDL5dPq0' alt='Flames and smoke engulf multiple high-rise towers at Wang Fuk Court estate in Hong Kong’s Tai Po district.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Estate under renovation: Wang Fuk Court consists of eight towers built in the 1980s with around 2,000 flats and roughly 4,600–4,800 residents, and the entire estate has been wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and green construction mesh for external repairs since 2024.</li><li>Injured and displaced: Authorities report more than 70 people in hospital with varying degrees of injury, and about 900 evacuated residents have been moved into at least eight temporary shelters set up across the city.</li><li>How fire spread: Investigators say preliminary findings indicate that burning scaffolding, plastic sheeting, mesh netting and expanded polystyrene foam used around windows created vertical fire paths on the façade and into corridors, accelerating the blaze between floors and neighboring blocks.</li><li>Online solidarity: Local social media has filled with condolence messages, offers of blood donations and posts collecting household supplies for survivors who lost homes and belongings in the estate.</li><li>Policy response: The tragedy has intensified scrutiny of Hong Kong’s continued use of combustible bamboo scaffolding and has accelerated a government plan, announced earlier in the year, to phase it out in favor of steel for high‑risk sites.</li></ul><blockquote>The priority is to extinguish the fire and rescue the residents who are trapped. - John Lee</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Hong Kong Police: Police say a construction firm may have been “grossly negligent” by leaving flammable materials on bamboo scaffolding and around windows, and have arrested three of its employees on suspicion of manslaughter.
