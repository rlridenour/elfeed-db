<p>In the latest escalation of the four‑year war, Russian forces launched a large combined strike of long‑range drones and missiles across Ukraine overnight, heavily damaging power plants and other energy infrastructure during one of the coldest nights of the winter. Officials in Kyiv and several regions reported hits on electricity facilities and residential buildings, which left large numbers of homes and public buildings without heating as temperatures in the capital fell to around minus 20 degrees Celsius. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the barrage involved roughly 450 drones and about 70 missiles of various types, and described it as Russia choosing military escalation over a diplomatic path a day before a second round of peace talks in Abu Dhabi brokered with U.S. involvement. The strikes came shortly after the expiry of a brief pause in Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy system that President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to because of the harsh winter conditions, and despite Trump’s request for a further halt to targeting the grid.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uDKF7N1F8KI87dsOQvPEfRk6xIGrjlhZqXvJx8rBK5MQcqrz6CqDDz1c-aFBiQj0fUkRMTpMlQkpXFyos6HmaVQlGXKB-rH8YCZhb2Q3LPlmQvqRjMpDmIVz4cMYIGGZMGLQxji_4TAK1fD_MkOrgroTodXC8FWvUmi4Uuiqfjnj19mVw6ftTNgIxrREErT8g7zzaZHE8CjYocw7nQFaYCQbejb68XnrQKD4bHrKPq-2B84dAv4BhG8j0bTMR6zJ1Idf7MZymVOwye_UHA' alt='A damaged apartment building in Kyiv after Russia’s missile and drone attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of damage: Kyiv’s mayor reported more than 1,100 buildings without electricity after the attack, while in Kharkiv city authorities had to drain water from the central heating network of over 800 apartment blocks to prevent system failures in the deep cold.</li><li>Targeted infrastructure: Ukrainian officials said the bombardment deliberately focused on the power grid and combined heat and power plants in at least five regions, with strikes also hitting nonresidential sites such as gas stations, vehicles, and an iconic Soviet‑era World War II monument.</li><li>Civilian emergency response: Ukraine’s State Emergency Service reported multiple injuries in Kyiv and deployed crews to extinguish fires in high‑rise buildings, while local authorities activated all of Kharkiv’s 101 round‑the‑clock “Points of Invincibility” offering warmth, hot drinks, and phone‑charging for residents.</li><li>Accusations and rhetoric: Ukrainian officials, citing Russia’s focus on energy systems during extreme cold, accused Moscow of conducting a “winter genocide” and of using freezing temperatures as part of its military strategy to pressure the population.</li><li>Starlink access changes: Separately from the strikes, Ukrainian authorities said they had worked with SpaceX to introduce technical changes intended to curb Russian forces’ ability to use Starlink satellite communications in occupied areas or near the front line.</li></ul><blockquote>The goal is obvious: to inflict maximum damage and leave the city without heat in extreme cold - Ihor Terekhov, mayor of Kharkiv</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Ukraine: President Zelenskyy argued that Russia’s overnight air campaign showed it was prioritising war over diplomacy and exploiting the lowest winter temperatures to intimidate civilians ahead of the peace talks.
