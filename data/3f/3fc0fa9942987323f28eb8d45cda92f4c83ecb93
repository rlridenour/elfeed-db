There's no word on what's include in the updated firmware, but the AirPods Pro 2, &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; with ANC, and &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; are both set to get expanded support for Live Translation in the European Union in iOS 26.2, which is being beta tested. <br/>
<br/>
The firmware could be related to that upcoming functionality, or it could add bug fixes and performance improvements. <br/>
<br/>
To install the new firmware, make sure your AirPods are in range of your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac. From there, put your AirPods in the Charging Case and connect the Charging Case to power. Keep the case closed and wait at least 30 minutes for the firmware update to install.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/13/airpods-pro-3-firmware-8b25/">Apple Releases New Firmware for AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, and AirPods 4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-firmware-for-airpods-pro-2-airpods-pro-3-and-airpods-4.2471111/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
