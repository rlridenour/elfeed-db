<p id="p2">In a surprise announcement this morning, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/lossless-audio-and-ultra-low-latency-audio-come-to-airpods-max/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple announced</a> that the AirPods Max with USB-C will be getting an update next month that adds support for lossless and ultra&#8209;low latency audio over the cable. According to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/lossless-audio-and-ultra-low-latency-audio-come-to-airpods-max/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the press release</a>:</p>

  With the included USB-C cable, users can enjoy the highest-quality audio across music, movies, and games, while music creators can experience significant enhancements to songwriting, beat making, production, and mixing.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p4">The update will enable 24-bit, 48&nbsp;kHz lossless audio, which Apple says is supported by over 100 million songs on Apple Music. Using the headphones&rsquo; USB-C cable, musicians will enjoy ultra-low latency and lossless audio in their Logic Pro workflows. The USB-C cable will allow them to produce Personalized Spatial Audio, too.</p>
<p id="p5">Apple also explains that the reduced latency is &ldquo;on par with the native built-in speakers on Mac, iPad, and iPhone,&rdquo; enhancing videogame play and streaming.</p>
<p id="p6">In addition to the software update, Apple is releasing <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MDV84AM/A/usb-c-to-35-mm-audio-cable-12-m" rel="noopener noreferrer">a $39&nbsp;3.5mm to USB-C cable</a> that can be purchased today. This is a nice update that, judging from the timing, will likely roll out alongside Apple&rsquo;s next set of OS releases. Although I&rsquo;d love to see Apple adapt its AirPlay technology to support low-latency, lossless audio, too, doing so via the USB-C cable that comes with the latest version of the headphones is a good start.</p>
