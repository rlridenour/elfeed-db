Before Apple unveiled the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/">there were rumors</a> suggesting that some features like the upgraded Telephoto camera <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/15/iphone-17-pro-max-telephoto-camera-rumor/">could be exclusive</a> to the Pro Max. In the past, Apple has limited some capabilities to the Pro Max, so it was a possibility, but the two devices have the same general feature set this year.<br/>

There are a few things that are different, of course, but that comes down to size.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Display</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max has a 6.9-inch display, while the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; has a smaller 6.3-inch display. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; is smaller and lighter weight than the Pro Max, and easier to use one-handed.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Battery</h2><br/>
Since there's more room in the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max for the battery, it lasts longer. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; offers up to 33 hours of video playback, while the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max offers up to 39 hours of video playback. It's the longest battery life in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to date.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Storage</h2><br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max, you can get up to 2TB of storage, which is a new upper limit for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; is limited to 1TB. The difference may be due to size and the space inside for storage components.<br/>
<br/>
The 2TB &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max costs &#36;2,000.<br/>
<br/>
There are no other differences between the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max, so if you opt for the smaller Pro model, you're only missing out on a larger display size, a longer battery, and the option to upgrade to 2TB of storage.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models will be available for pre-order this Friday.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/10/iphone-17-pro-vs-pro-max/">iPhone 17 Pro vs. iPhone 17 Pro Max: What&#039;s Exclusive to Apple&#039;s Largest Flagship iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-vs-iphone-17-pro-max-whats-exclusive-to-apples-largest-flagship-iphone.2465259/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
