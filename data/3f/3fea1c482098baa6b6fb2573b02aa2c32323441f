<p>It&#8217;s been a while since Apple introduced Nano-texture glass on iPad, and in that time, <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/">they&#8217;ve expanded the option</a> to the MacBook Pro. What&#8217;s interesting to me is that we haven&#8217;t seen any major controversies or &#8220;gates&#8221; surrounding this technology. The Nano-texture glass seems to be delivering as promised, reducing glare while maintaining a sharp, high-quality display.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve had the chance to use the Nano-texture glass option on iPad and have seen it on the MacBook Pro as well. The common complaint that colors appear slightly less vibrant is valid, but the screen remains incredibly sharp. And if you need a non-reflective display, this is an obvious choice. It makes particular sense on iPad and MacBook Pro, given that these are among Apple&#8217;s devices that are often used outdoors or in bright lighting conditions.</p>



<p>Another positive development is the price. I remember that when choosing the Nano-texture glass on the Pro Display XDR, it set you back $1,000. Now, you can get it on a MacBook Pro for just $150.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder if Apple will eventually bring Nano-texture to the iPhone. Given how often people use their phones in direct sunlight, it could help. Regardless, for those who need a high-end, anti-reflective display, Apple&#8217;s Nano-texture glass is the best I&#8217;ve seen, and far superior to any screen treatment or film I&#8217;ve tried.</p>
