<p id="p4">In the 16 years that I&rsquo;ve been writing for MacStories, I&rsquo;ve seen my fair share of new apps that have come and gone. Apps that promised to revolutionize a particular segment of the App Store were eventually acquired, discontinued, or simply abandoned. It&rsquo;s been <em>very</em> unusual to witness an indie app survive in a highly competitive marketplace, let alone to find one that <em>thrived</em> after having been sold twice to different owners over the years. But such is the case of <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unread</a>, the RSS client now developed by <a href="https://iosdev.space/@johnbrayton" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Brayton</a> of Golden Hill Software and the recipient of this year&rsquo;s MacStories Selects <strong>Lifetime Achievement Award</strong>.</p>

</aside><p id="p6">Unread was originally created by indie developer <a href="https://jaredsinclair.com/apps.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jared Sinclair</a> in 2014, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/supertop-buys-unread/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold to Supertop</a> (at the time, the makers of <a href="https://castro.fm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Castro</a>), and then <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/2017/08/golden-hill-software-acquires-unread/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold again to Golden Hill Software in 2017</a>. When it first came out in 2014, Unread entered a crowded space: in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23778253/google-reader-death-2013-rss-social" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Reader&rsquo;s demise in 2013</a>, third-party companies and developers rushed to offer comparable RSS syncing services and compatible apps to let users sync their RSS subscriptions and read articles across multiple devices.</p>
<p id="p7">In <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/unread-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer">my original review from 2014</a>, I noted how Unread set a new standard for elegant, gesture-driven interfaces optimized for phones that were getting progressively larger and harder to operate with one hand. With a fluid and minimal interface driven by &ldquo;<a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/sloppy-swiping/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sloppy gestures</a>&rdquo; that didn&rsquo;t require precision or specific buttons, Unread stood out because it followed Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/living-with-ios-7/" rel="noopener noreferrer">then-new</a> &ldquo;flat design&rdquo; but imbued it with personality in the form of typographic choices, colors, share options (Sinclair created <a href="https://github.com/overshare/overshare-kit" rel="noopener noreferrer">a custom share sheet</a> before an official one even <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-8-changed-how-i-work-on-my-iphone-and-ipad/" rel="noopener noreferrer">existed</a>), and a novel interaction mechanism for an RSS reader.</p>
<p id="p8">After a three-year stint as a Supertop product, Unread was taken under the wing of John Brayton, who did something exceptionally rare: instead of following short-lived industry trends and fads, he doubled down on Unread&rsquo;s essence while judiciously embracing modern technologies. Eleven years after its inception and eight years after its second sale to a different developer, Unread still stands out in the third-party indie app market because it&rsquo;s managed to honor its lineage while adapting to the ever-changing nature of the Apple ecosystem.</p>

<p id="p10">Unread still is, at a fundamental level, an elegant and polished RSS client that syncs with multiple services and presents articles in a minimal, clutter-free UI that you can easily control with your thumb. Everything else around it, however, has evolved and expanded. Unread is now available on the iPad and Mac, where it supports features such as menu bar commands, windowing, and keyboard shortcuts. There is an Unread Cloud syncing service that is fully managed by its developer. Last year, Brayton shipped an incredibly powerful and custom Shortcuts integration that lets you trigger automations in the Shortcuts app <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/a-feature-from-10-years-ago-is-back-with-a-twist-in-my-favorite-rss-client/" rel="noopener noreferrer">from individual articles in Unread</a>. This year, Brayton adapted to another new reality of the modern web: Unread can now securely store <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/2025/07/unread-45-adds-support-for-paywalled-articles/" rel="noopener noreferrer">logins for paywalled websites</a> &ndash; such as <a href="https://club.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Club MacStories</a> &ndash; so that all your articles that require a subscription to be read can be saved and accessed within the app. And in all of this, the modern Unread is both unmistakably the &ldquo;same&rdquo; app from 11 years ago, but also something far greater that has built upon Sinclair&rsquo;s original idea thanks to the constant, relentless work of its current developer, John Brayton.</p>
<p id="p11">If you&rsquo;ve been reading MacStories all these years, you know that this is no easy feat. Most app acquisitions don&rsquo;t work out in the end, leaving users with the bittersweet nostalgia of something that used to be great and was eventually swallowed up by the greater scheme of economic factors, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/app-preservation-saving-the-app-stores-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer">app rot</a>, technical debt, and App Store changes.</p>
<p id="p12">Against all odds, <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unread</a> has successfully bucked that trend and evolved into a mature, powerful product that continues to stand alone in the sea of RSS clients as a beacon of hope for indie developers and our community as a whole. There is nothing else like it. For all these reasons, we couldn&rsquo;t think of an app more worthy of the MacStories Selects Lifetime Achievement Award in 2025.</p>
