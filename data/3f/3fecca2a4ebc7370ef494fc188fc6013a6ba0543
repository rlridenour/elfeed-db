Intro Due to the nature of my work, I operate in a variety of environments, databases, and languages. Emacs is very good for this. As an example of this, I just found myself needing to verify if an update had worked on the PostGres database of a remote server. First I logged in to the server with better-shell-remote-open1, and then I sudoed and changed to the postgres user, then I quickly fired up my bookmarked myPostgres.
