<p>In Emacs, when you press <code>M-y</code>, you can go through all the recent text snippets that are stored in your kill ring (aka &ldquo;clipboard&rdquo; in modern-day programs) via <code>yank-pop</code>. In two seconds, I found what I needed from yesterday, and I&rsquo;m ready to go.</p>
<p>Emacs is just like that, once you learn to use it. Two seconds, you get what you need (for me, usually in org-mode), and you move on with your life. Everything is tailored to fit <em>you</em>, the user. That&rsquo;s what happens when a bunch of productivity geeks sit together and build a program.</p>
<p>Sure, not all (and even most) programs that are open source end the same way, but Emacs is unique. It&rsquo;s a shining example of what happens when different people have different needs and are provided with open tools to answer those needs. I&rsquo;m not a Lisp coder, but I know that when I need to change something or tweak it, I can, and I have all the help documentation and a community behind me to help achieve what I need.</p>
