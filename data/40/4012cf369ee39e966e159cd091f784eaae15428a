In the iOS 26 beta, Apple has redesigned the alarm screen in the Clock app, giving it a cleaner look with a larger time display and significantly bigger buttons. When the alarm goes off, you'll now see two large, equal-sized buttons for Stop and Snooze placed side by side at the bottom of the screen.<br/>
<br/>

While the redesign fits with Apple's broader visual refresh in iOS 26, it also seems to address a problem the company had already solved: reducing the chances of you hitting Stop instead of Snooze when you're half-awake and fumbling for your phone. Ironically, internal testing once showed that making both buttons the same size actually made that mistake more likely.<br/>
<br/>
According to Jack Fields, a former Apple engineer and head writer at <em><a href="https://linktr.ee/kernelextension">Kernel Extension</a></em>, the new layout contradicts internal research he was involved in during his time at the company. That testing included a version of the Clock app that logged user interactions to a heat map, tracking exactly where people tapped the screen upon waking.<br/>
<br/>
"It was recording where our sleepy hands were smacking around on the screen in order to see how accurate we were in turning off the alarms," <a href="https://x.com/OrdinaryInds/status/1936084188232343924">says Fields</a>. What they found was perhaps counterintuitive: when Stop and Snooze were made the same size and placed close together, users were 30% more likely to hit Stop by accident. In other words, it actually <em>increased</em> the chances of oversleeping.<br/>
<br/>
That's why recent versions of iOS feature a prominent, centered Snooze button and a much smaller Stop button tucked further down the screen. "By making the Stop button such a small hit target, it ensures you're awake enough to actually stop it," Fields explains.<br/>
<br/>
"This new design is... interesting," he <a href="https://x.com/OrdinaryInds/status/1936086336898802013">adds</a>. "It goes against any studies I was a part of, so I'm curious what data they have to support the change. It's terrifyingly large now."<br/>
<br/>
It's worth remembering this is beta software, and Apple could tweak the layout before the final release. But for now, the update makes you wonder whether a more symmetrical, simplified UI is always better, or (at least in this case) is it more likely to make you tap the wrong thing, just faster?<br/>

In a related change you may have missed, Apple also now allows users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/11/ios-26-big-change-iphone-alarm-options/">customize snooze length</a>, choosing a length of time between 1 minute and 15 minutes. (Previously, tapping snooze always snoozed an alarm for nine minutes.) Now that's a change we can certainly get behind.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/24/new-alarm-design-ios-26-make-you-oversleep/">Apple&#039;s New Alarm Design in iOS 26 Might Make You Oversleep</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-alarm-design-in-ios-26-might-make-you-oversleep.2459605/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
