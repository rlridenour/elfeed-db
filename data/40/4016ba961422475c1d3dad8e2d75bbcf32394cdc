<blockquote>
  <p>The Hikawa Phone Grip &amp; Stand is a MagSafe compatible adaptive
accessory for iPhone designed by Bailey Hikawa to celebrate the
40th anniversary of accessibility at Apple. Designed with direct
input from individuals with disabilities affecting muscle
strength, dexterity, and hand control, this ergonomic grip was
designed with accessibility in mind from the ground up. The grip
uses magnets to securely snap onto any iPhone with MagSafe, can be
removed with ease, and doubles as a stand to support iPhone at two
different viewing angles, both vertically and horizontally.
Inspired by modern sculpture, each Hikawa product is an art object
unto itself. The limited edition Hikawa Phone Grip &amp; Stand is
available in two colors, a bold, high-visibility Chartreuse and
recycled Crater, exclusive to Apple.</p>

<p>Looks like a perfectly cromulent accessory, but <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/hikawa-chartreuse.jpeg">Chartreuse</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/hikawa-crater.jpeg">Crater</a> are both a bit out there — in different ways — to be the only two color options. Or, I should say, <em>were</em> a bit out there. Both are already sold out from Apple.</p>

<p>I’m not quite sure what’s limited about the Chartreuse, given that Hikawa’s website <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/products/wavy-triangle-grip-stand-in-chartreuse">still lists it as “ready to ship”</a> along with pre-orders for <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/products/hikawa-adaptive-grip-stand-in-cobalt">Cobalt</a> and <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/products/wavy-triangle-grip-stand-in-chartreuse-copy">Blurple Swirl</a> (whose URL seems a bit rushed).</p>

<p>Amusing to see Apple partner with a company whose main products alongside iPhone cases are <a href="https://www.baileyhikawa.com/collections/toilet-seats">fanciful toilet seats</a>.</p>
