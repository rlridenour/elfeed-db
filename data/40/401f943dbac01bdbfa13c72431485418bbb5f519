The new ringtone is an alternative version of the existing Reflection ringtone, which has been the default ringtone since the iPhone X was released in 2017. It was discovered within the code for the first developer beta of iOS 26, but it remains hidden, so you will not find it in the list of ringtones available in the Settings app for now.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if Apple will move forward with releasing the ringtone in a later iOS 26 beta version.<br/>
<br/>
The new ringtone was shared on X yesterday <a href="https://x.com/8810cfw/status/1935248131157049700">by the account @8810cfw</a>, in a post that was later reposted by the account <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco">ShrimpApplePro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1935886629530419213">also confirmed the ringtone's existence</a>, and he speculated that it could debut on iPhone 17 models later this year.<br/>

On a related note, we recently reported that iOS 26 makes it easier to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/17/ios-26-use-as-ringtone-option/">set an audio file as a custom ringtone</a>, by eliminating the need to use the GarageBand app.<br/>

iOS 26 should be released to all users in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/19/ios-26-beta-hidden-new-ringtone/">iOS 26 Beta is Hiding a New Ringtone — Here&#039;s What It Sounds Like</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-beta-is-hiding-a-new-ringtone-—-heres-what-it-sounds-like.2459344/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
