<p>President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a face‑to‑face meeting in Busan on October 30, 2025, and announced an extendable one‑year trade truce that pauses some Chinese export restrictions on rare earths and eases U.S. tariff pressure while pledging follow‑up talks . The leaders said Beijing would resume purchases of U.S. soybeans and work to curb illicit fentanyl flows, and Mr. Trump said he would lower certain tariffs as part of the package . The announcement was described by Mr. Trump as a major breakthrough and was followed by positive market moves in China and a stronger yuan, as investors hoped tensions would ease global supply‑chain disruptions .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eyVjaNx-6h7QjT17Z4PEkXf6yMLblm0cOq447xTWhggrCaIUlUVG6mBNbqI4jN5Ihq21S8gjQW53yTB9ZBXigg0zHsQrlwL6w3FNI1mgrFR-' alt='US President Donald Trump (L) and China’s President Xi Jinping shake hands as they leave after their talks at the Gimhae Air Base in Busan on October 30, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tariff change: President Trump said he would cut an existing tariff level from 57% to 47% on Chinese goods, a figure he announced after the meeting .</li><li>Meeting duration: The leaders met for nearly two hours in Busan, their first in‑person talks since 2019, signaling a rare direct high‑level engagement .</li><li>Market reaction: Chinese stocks rose to multi‑year highs and the yuan strengthened to near a one‑year peak on hopes the truce would reduce trade uncertainty .</li><li>Follow‑up schedule: Mr. Trump said he would visit China in April for follow‑up talks and that Xi would visit the United States at a later date, framing the truce as the start of continuing engagement .</li></ul><blockquote>I guess, on the scale from zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12. - President Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He described the talks as a &quot;great success,&quot; said rare earths had been &quot;settled,&quot; and announced tariff cuts and planned future visits to China .
