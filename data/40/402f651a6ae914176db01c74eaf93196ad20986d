Apple today released new firmware designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a>, prior-generation AirPods Pro 2, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> models.

There's no word on what's include in the updated firmware, but the prior 8A356 update added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> features to the AirPods Pro 2, &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;, and &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; with ANC. The software introduced better audio quality for phone calls and video calls, studio-quality audio recording for interviews, podcasts, videos, Live Translation, and more.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible that the 8A358 firmware addresses a bug or brings improvements to some of the new &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; AirPods features.<br/>
<br/>
To install the new firmware, make sure your AirPods are in range of your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac.
