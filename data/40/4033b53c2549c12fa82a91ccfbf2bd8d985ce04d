Apple's Beats brand will soon come out with new color options for several of its products, according to information discovered by <em>MacRumors</em>. The Beats Studio Pro headphones are set to be released in colors that Apple is referring to as dark slate and pink internally. It is worth noting that we've previously seen mentions of unreleased Sand Gray and Soft Pink colors for the Studio Pro, and it’s possible these are same colors currently labeled by Apple as Dark Slate and Pink.<br/>
