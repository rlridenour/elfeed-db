Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ks775ehf">announced</a> an overhaul of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>'s age rating system across all of its platforms.<br/>
<br/>

The company has added three new age rating tiers — 13+, 16+, and 18+ — to the existing 4+ and 9+ classifications. At the same time, the 12+ and 17+ categories are being removed.<br/>
<br/>
The new framework is designed to give parents more control and clarity over which apps are appropriate for their children and to better align &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; ratings with region-specific standards. As part of the rollout, Apple has reassigned age ratings for all existing apps and games based on the responses developers previously provided in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect age rating questionnaire.<br/>
<br/>
Developers are now required to complete an updated version of that questionnaire, which includes several new mandatory questions covering in-app controls, app capabilities, medical or wellness content, and violent themes. These answers will be used to recalculate the app's age rating.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is requiring developers to complete the updated questionnaire by January 31, 2026. After that date, developers who have not responded will be unable to submit new app updates in &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect until they do so.<br/>
<br/>
The new age ratings are now live in the beta versions of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe 26</a>, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a>. They will become visible to the public when the updates are officially released in the fall.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/25/apple-overhauls-app-store-age-ratings/">Apple Overhauls App Store Age Ratings</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-overhauls-app-store-age-ratings.2462213/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
