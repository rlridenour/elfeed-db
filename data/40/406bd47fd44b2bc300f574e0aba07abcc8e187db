Disney has introduced a new promotion on its streaming service for Black Friday and Cyber Monday shoppers, offering a bundle of Disney+ (with ads) and Hulu (with ads) for <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/BQ7X4"><strong>&#36;4.99 per month for 12 months</strong></a>, down from &#36;12.99 per month. This offer represents a savings of 61 percent on the Disney+/Hulu bundle, and after twelve months it will return to the then-current monthly price unless cancelled.<br/>
