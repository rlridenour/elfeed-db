<p>Ghost:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we <a href="https://ghost.org/changelog/5/">announced Ghost 5.0</a> a few years ago, we were proud
to share that Ghost’s revenue had hit $4M — while publisher
earnings had surpassed $10M. It felt great to have such a clear
sign that our goal to create a sustainable business model for
independent creators was succeeding.</p>

<p>Today, Ghost’s annual revenue is over $8.5M while total publisher
earnings on Ghost have now surpassed $100M. [...]</p>

<p>Unlike our venture-backed peers obsessed with growth at all costs,
we’re structured as a non-profit foundation that serves publishers
directly with open source software. We believe independent media
cannot be beholden to proprietary tech companies, so Ghost
publishers don’t just “own their email list” — they own the
entire software stack that underpins their business, end to end.</p>

<p>Not a centralized platform controlled by a single corporation, but
open infrastructure that’s shared by everyone.</p>

<p>Aside from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/substack">my feelings about Substack</a> — clearly the main target of Ghost’s shade-throwing here — it’s just great to see so many indie publishers and writers thriving on Ghost.</p>
