mostly monochromatic in many contexts. Styles involve the careful use
of typography, such as italics and bold italics.</p>

<p>If you want maximalist themes in terms of colour, check my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code>
package. For something in-between, which I would consider the best
“default theme” for a text editor, opt for my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code>.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>The new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oak</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pine</code> themes</h2>

<p>These explore the woody+earthly style:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-oak</code> has dark text against an ochre background, with accents
of green.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-pine</code> uses light text against a dark green background, with
accents of brown.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Background colours for diffs</h2>

<p>All diff-related interfaces, including Magit, diff-mode, and Ediff,
now use colour-coded background values where appropriate. This is done
to improve usability, as it otherwise can be hard to discern the
boundaries of individual diff hunks.</p>

<h2>Alternating foreground values for message/email quotes</h2>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">message-mode</code>, Gnus, and related interfaces all quoted/cited
message level now conforming with an odd VS even colouring scheme. The
style is still subtle, but now the individual levels of depths are
easier to spot.</p>
