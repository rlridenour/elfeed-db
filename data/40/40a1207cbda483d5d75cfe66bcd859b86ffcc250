<p>By default, Emacs typically displays curly arrows when wrapping lines. While likely a handy feature to some, I didn't really find much use for it. At the same time, I never looked into their removal until now.</p>
<p>Turns out, there's a <code>continuation</code> entry in <code>fringe-indicator-alist</code> variable that handles this. Removing this entry also removes the curly arrows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(setq-default fringe-indicator-alist
              (delq (assq 'continuation fringe-indicator-alist) fringe-indicator-alist))
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, one could write a simple function to toggle displaying the continuation indicator.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(defun toggle-continuation-fringe-indicator ()
  (interactive)
  (setq-default
   fringe-indicator-alist
   (if (assq 'continuation fringe-indicator-alist)
       (delq (assq 'continuation fringe-indicator-alist) fringe-indicator-alist)
     (cons '(continuation right-curly-arrow left-curly-arrow) fringe-indicator-alist))))
</code></pre>
<p>That's it for this post. A tiny tip. Perhaps there's a better way to handle it. If you know, I'd love to know too (<a href="https://indieweb.social/@xenodium">Mastodon</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/xenodium">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium">Reddit</a> / <a href="mailto:me__AT__xenodium.com">Email</a>).</p>
