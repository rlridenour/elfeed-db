<blockquote>
  <p>A major Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage took down multiple online
services for around four hours this morning, including Amazon,
Alexa, Snapchat, Fortnite, <a href="https://status.openai.com/incidents/01K80CBJD5Z64DF82KGT3K3QE0">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://x.com/EOSStatus/status/1980194104115150858">Epic Games Store,
Epic Online Services</a>, and more.</p>

<p>As of 6:35AM ET, the <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">AWS status checker</a> is reporting that
“most AWS Service operations are succeeding normally now,” and
some of the impacted platforms, including <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1980249794502082948">Fortnite</a>,
<a href="https://x.com/EOSStatus/status/1980226546607726916">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1980239929189036222">Perplexity</a> have announced
that they are fully recovered and back online.</p>

<p>However, as of 9:50AM ET, Amazon says that multiple services in
the US-EAST-1 Region are still “impacted” by operational issues,
and that it is working towards a full resolution. The AWS
dashboard first reported issues affecting the US-EAST-1 Region at
3:11AM ET, with global services in other regions also taken
offline. The cause of the outage hasn’t been confirmed, and it’s
unclear when regular service will be fully restored.</p>

<p>I bet it was this AWS outage that explains why I couldn’t sign in to my NYT account to play Wordle this morning. (Got it in 4 today.)</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">Amazon claims the issues were resolved</a> at the end of the day. I still couldn’t order food for delivery from a few local restaurants, including any that depended on Doordash or Toast, at 7pm ET though.</p>
