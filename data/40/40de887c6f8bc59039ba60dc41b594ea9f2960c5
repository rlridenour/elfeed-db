<p>It took 90 years to complete. But, in 2011, scholars at the University of Chicago finally published<a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/assyrian-dictionary-oriental-institute-university-chicago-cad"> a&nbsp;21-volume dictionary of Akkadian, </a>the language used&nbsp;in&nbsp;ancient Mesopotamia. Unspoken for 2,000 years, Akkadian was preserved on clay tablets and in stone inscriptions until scholars deciphered it during the last two centuries.</p>

Now, should you wish, you can <a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/assyrian-dictionary-oriental-institute-university-chicago-cad">download PDFs of U. Chicago’s Akkadian dictionary for free</a>. All 21 volumes would cost well over $1,945 if purchased in hard copy.
