<blockquote>
  <p>You can speculate what the ‘e’ in ‘16e’ stands for, but in my head
it stands for ‘essential’. Some things that I consider
particularly essential to the iPhone are all there: fantastic
build quality, an OLED screen, iOS and all its apps, and Face ID.
It even has satellite connectivity. Some other things I also
consider essential are not here: MagSafe is very missed, for
instance, but also multiple cameras. It would be reasonable to look at
Apple’s Camera app, then, and see what comprises the ‘essential’
iPhone camera experience according to Apple.</p>
