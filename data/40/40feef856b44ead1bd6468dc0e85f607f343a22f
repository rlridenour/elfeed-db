<p id="p2">Today, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple reported its 2026 Q1 earnings</a>, posting quarterly revenue of $143.8 billion a 16% increase from a year ago.</p>
<p id="p3">Apple CEO Tim Cook had this to say of the results:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  Today, Apple is proud to report a remarkable, record-breaking quarter, with revenue of $143.8 billion, up 16 percent from a year ago and well above our expectations. iPhone had its best-ever quarter driven by unprecedented demand, with all-time records across every geographic segment, and Services also achieved an all-time revenue record, up 14 percent from a year ago. We are also excited to announce that our installed base now has more than 2.5 billion active devices, which is a testament to incredible customer satisfaction for the very best products and services in the world.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">As CFO Kevan Parekh noted in Apple’s press release, today’s results set an all-time earnings-per-share record, with an 19% increase and $54 billion of operating cash flow.</p>
<p id="p6">So yes, Apple continues to make a lot of money. Global trade politics, currency exchange rates, component prices like RAM, and other factors are all risks that could put a damper on the company’s earnings in the future, but so far, the company is doing fine.
