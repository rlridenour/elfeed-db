<p>The European Commission has proposed letting EU farmers access up to about €45 billion in agricultural funding earlier than planned, aiming to ease farm-sector anger as the EU tries to finalize its long-negotiated trade agreement with the Mercosur bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). With EU countries expected to take a pivotal position by Friday, EU sources said the funding pledge appears to have moved Italy toward backing the deal—an important shift after Rome’s hesitation helped derail hopes of a December signing. Brussels wants to sign the pact in South America next week, but the proposal reflects the balancing act between expanding export opportunities for European industry and addressing concerns from EU farmers about increased competition from South American agricultural products.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/LWXpnI_gT4Z6k_zC9ELVovmDYDgNm8M7sRywVL0TixgMiLIzGgBzevIl6JaUpIrnZiu5QC6XTJozERl-LplTXtHiglOtW-WSJFjZjfw8vGronA125IWElgwJoxRN3hLRLFUCgOt26dO7fCAYobItEolCzYai7dwwPxzdx62mcJIah_Y' alt='Farmers protest outside the European Parliament in Brussels on December 18, 2025, over EU agriculture reforms and the EU-Mercosur trade deal.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Swing vote Italy: Politico reports Italy is the key deciding vote because Germany and Spain have pushed for the deal while France and Poland oppose it, making Rome’s position central to assembling a majority.</li><li>Minister talks Brussels: EU agriculture ministers are due to meet in Brussels on Wednesday for an extraordinary session focused on getting the Mercosur accord over the line, according to RFI.</li><li>Industry versus farms: The pact is described as strongly backed by Europe’s large manufacturers seeking more sales of cars, machinery and chemicals in Latin America, while Mercosur producers would gain greater access to sell food into Europe.</li><li>December setback: Italy’s refusal to back the agreement previously forced Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to cancel a planned December signing trip, Politico reported.</li><li>Italy shift signaled: France 24 reported EU sources saying the new farm-funding pledge appears to have secured Italian support, boosting prospects for next steps on the agreement.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Commission (von der Leyen): The Commission is pushing to sign the Mercosur agreement soon and is offering earlier access to agricultural funding to address farmer concerns and help secure member-state backing.
