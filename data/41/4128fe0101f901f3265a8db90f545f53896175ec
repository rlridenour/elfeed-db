Apple said today that it might be "forced" to disable a key anti-ad tracking feature in the European Union, reports <a href="https://www.dpa-international.com/culture-and-science/"><em>DPA International</em></a>.<br/>

"Intense lobbying efforts in Germany, Italy and other countries in Europe may force us to withdraw this feature to the detriment of European consumers," Apple said in a statement to DPA.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is referring to App Tracking Transparency (ATT), a feature that lets <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users decide whether to allow apps to track their activity across other apps and websites for advertising purposes. Users can choose to allow apps to ask for permission, or turn off tracking entirely.<br/>
<br/>
The anti-tracking features were implemented in Apple's iOS 14 updates. ATT prevents apps from accessing the advertising identifier of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> without express permission, so apps can't track what users do on their devices and then use the information gleaned for ad targeting.<br/>
<br/>
ATT has been unsurprisingly unpopular with advertisers and data brokers. Facebook rallied hard against App Tracking Transparency ahead of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/28/facebook-att-impact-manageable/">when it rolled out</a>, positioning Apple as an enemy of small businesses and taking out multiple full-page newspaper ads.<br/>
<br/>
Germany launched a probe into App Tracking Transparency <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/14/apple-faces-antitrust-probe-into-att/">back in 2022</a>, and in February 2025, Germany's Federal Cartel Office preliminarily ruled that Apple abused its market power with ATT, giving itself preferential treatment, even though Apple says it does not collect data from third-party apps. The cartel said that Apple's restrictions made it "far more difficult" for app publishers to access user data relevant for advertising.<br/>
<br/>
In March 2025, Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-hit-with-162-million-fine-over-att/">fined 150 million euros</a> by France's Competition Authority. French regulators said that Apple complicated the process for users to opt out of tracking and unfairly disadvantaged third-party developers and ad providers. Apple is facing a similar investigation in Italy, with a ruling expected later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said that it has presented solutions to regulators in Europe, but it is facing complex solutions that would undermine App Tracking Transparency. Apple also said it will work to keep the feature available to Europeans. "We will continue to urge the relevant authorities in Germany, Italy and across Europe to allow Apple to continue providing this important privacy tool to our users."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/">App Tracking Transparency</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/23/apple-app-tracking-transparency-europe/">Apple Warns App Tracking Transparency Could Be Disabled in Europe</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-warns-app-tracking-transparency-could-be-disabled-in-europe.2469702/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
