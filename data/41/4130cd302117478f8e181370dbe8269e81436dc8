<p>This is something I came across recently.
I wanted to search for <code>#todo</code> using <code>M-x consult-grep</code>.</p>
<p>My initial <code>#todo</code> query didn&rsquo;t work obviously because <code>#</code> sign in consult
is a <em>punctuation character</em> as they call it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really want to change <code>#</code> sign as a punctuation character because I used to it.
I&rsquo;m not also sure if there is such an option (read til the end to find out why)</p>
<p>After some time spent googling
I couldn&rsquo;t find how to do escape it.
Obvious things like <code>#\#todo</code> didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Then I found this example in <a href="https://github.com/minad/consult#asynchronous-search">consult readme</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/defun/consult</code>: It is also possible to use other punctuation characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not somewhere on the top of the readme. It&rsquo;s under <em>Asynchronous Search</em> section which
I ignored while I was looking for my use case.</p>
<p>So it seems like any NON [A-Za-z0-9] character can be a punctuation character.
Though I&rsquo;m not sure about it.</p>
<p>In any case <code>/#todo</code> worked nicely but it was unnecessary hard to find the proper syntax for it.</p>
