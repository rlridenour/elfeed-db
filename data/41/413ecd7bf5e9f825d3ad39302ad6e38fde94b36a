<p>Visiting Lord Byron in 1821, Percy Shelley wrote to his friend Thomas Love Peacock:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Byron&#8217;s establishment consists, besides servants, of ten horses, eight enormous dogs, three monkeys, five cats, an eagle, a crow, and a falcon; and all these, except the horses, walk about the house, which every now and then resounds with their unarbitrated quarrels as if they were the masters of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added in a postscript: &#8220;I have just met on the grand staircase five peacocks, two guinea-hens, and an Egyptian crane. I wonder who all these animals were, before they were changed into these shapes.&#8221;</p>
