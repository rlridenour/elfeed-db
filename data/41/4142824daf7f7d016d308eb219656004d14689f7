</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A weekend of reading, including “Open Socrates” by Agnes Callard.
</p>
        <p><time datetime="2025-06-08" title="2025-06-08">Last night</time> I started reading <cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite> by Agnes Callard.  I’m early in the book, but a core early concept is the
challenges of the Untimely Question: that is a question for which we’re already
moving along with/through the answer.  “When did you decide to be a good
person?”  “Am I a good parent?”  are examples of those questions.</p>
<p>The Untimely Questions are harder to wrestle with and ask of oneself, in part
because our current implicit answers, and the vectors of our movement in regards
to those answers, may be void if we ask the question and make earnest inquiry.</p>
<p>I learned of <cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite> by Agnes Callard
from John Rakestraw’s <a href="https://johnrakestraw.com/reading/february-2025/">February 2025</a>.  And as I read more of John’s posts, I
found a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>Callard introduced Tolstoy’s <cite>Confession</cite>, as an example of the
challenge of the Untimely Question.  Namely Tolstoy had it all, and demonstrated
through his literature that he could wrestle with Untimely Questions; but only
in the fictive world.  Even he was ill-equipped to inquire when directed at his
lived life.</p>
<p>While reading the first 100 or so pages, my thoughts still carrying my recent
read of <cite data-id="95cc0be8-ed94-44c5-a193-696c32426e72">When No Thing Works</cite> by Norma Kaelokū Wong, I thought of Wong’s
visioning exercise.  Skipping past the imminent apocalypse, to a point where
those wounds are healing.  And how that will look.  Seven Generation thinking.</p>
<p>I feel as though Wong is helping me peek around the corners thus far presented
by Callard; not as a short-cut but as tools for further reflection and
consideration.</p>
<p>In the margins of my copy of <cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite>—as Callard was highlighting
Tolstoy’s literary ability to address a fictive character’s Untimely Question,
but failure to address his own—I scribbled a quote that in the moment I
misattributed to Olga Tokarczuk (thinking it came from <cite data-id="794167BA-7164-49CB-AE69-66030BCEFF5F">Flights</cite>):</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="20221009T120408">
<p>
Keeping the secret <i class="dfn">of</i> ourselves <i class="dfn">from</i> ourselves can be exhausting.
</p>
<footer>&#8213;Will Storr, <cite>The Science of Storytelling</cite></footer></blockquote>
<p><time datetime="2025-06-09" title="2025-06-09">This morning</time> as I started searching for the quote, I reconsidered and thought
“No this must’ve been Solnit, probably <cite data-id="C34F6133-45F8-4495-8D23-0407FD322510">Orwell’s Roses</cite>.  My initial guess, and
even reconsideration, were wrong.</p>
<p>As my energy waned for engaging <cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite>; perhaps as I felt the book was
turning towards me engaging my personal Untimely Questions, I chose to set it
aside, let it digest a bit, and get ready for bed.  I wasn’t tired, but instead
full.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> Was I myself doing what those conversing with Socrates did?  “Socrates, I really must be going…”<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>I changed into my pajamas, let the dogs out before bed, and jumped back into
<cite data-id="kafka-on-the-shore-by-haruki-murakami">Kafka on the Shore</cite> by Haruki Murakami.  I read three or four more chapters.
And even though I wasn’t tired, I set that down with a sense of fullness.  As
though I’d attended a dinner party with wise and thoughtful friends; and the
conversations moved to the campfire.  A place of mythic soulful conversation.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-06-09" title="2025-06-09">This morning</time>, I started writing in my personal journal; which has become this
post.  Feeling the warmth and glow of sunshine on my shoulder from our
southeast facing window.  Also feeling the lingering warmth of that evening’s
metaphorical fire.</p>
<p>And I think, what of these books I’ve gathered and with which I’ve communed?
Knowing (and hoping) that each contains a potential energy, a seed waiting for
germination and planting.  These gathered books might provide comfort, guidance,
hope, instigation, or memory.</p>
<p>I look forward to sitting for another spell and reading more of <cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite>.  I suspect challenging inquiry awaits.</p>
