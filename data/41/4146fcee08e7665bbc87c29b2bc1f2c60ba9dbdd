<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>I got a new iMac. Apple M4. The only regret. It has 16 gigs of memory. Should have gotten 32. I forgot how Safari and Chrome love memory.</p>
<p>I love the machine. It is quick. The screen is smaller than my 27 inch iMac (mid-2011). I am not missing the screen real estate. I live in Emacs, in full-screen and that is perfect for me.</p>
<p>Tahoe is the OS. That has been a disappointment. Buggy. Ugly. Dumb. Great hardware hobbled by horrible software. That is the state of the Mac today.</p>
<p>Still using the <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander" target="_blank">Moonlander</a>. You have no idea how much I love this keyboard. Life-changing. For the first time in 20 years, my hands are pain-free. I must admit though that the Moonlander has made it impossible to use any of the standard staggered layout keyboards. The horizontal layout grows on you and makes it impossible to use any other. That is a bummer, but I carry the <a href="https://blog.zsa.io/2307-goodbye-planck-ez/" target="_blank">Planck</a> around when I have to go places. Use the Moonlander at home, which is almost all the time, I don’t get out much nowadays.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>I will break this category down into two parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Writing software, and</li>
<li>Others.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="writing-software">Writing Software</h3>
<p>This category has drastically shrunk for me. I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a>, for all of my writing. Readers of this blog will be familiar with the journey. I am all-in on Emacs. It is where I live. It handles all of my writing. Books, notes, lists, outlines, scratch files. Everything is in Emacs.</p>
<p>The effect of this immersion into Emacs is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>My comfort in the program has grown.</li>
<li>I am learning elisp, in small increments, to be able to customize the program to my needs.</li>
<li>Learning how to operate in a program this deep is intellectually fulfilling. In other words, I am enjoying life in Emacs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other programs which get used once in a while: for specific tasks, or for support when I screw something up in Emacs and everything goes to hell.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://zed.dev/" target="_blank">Zed</a>. This is a new editor which is distinguished by being fast, and modern. I prefer it to VSCode.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/" target="_blank">BBEdit</a>. The old workhorse still shines in handling large files and being responsive and elegant.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ia.net/writer" target="_blank">iA Writer</a>. I find this to be the best Markdown based text editor besides Emacs. It also does a great job telling me that I am using too many adverbs in my writing.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="other-software">Other Software</h3>
<p>This is a list of programs which make my computing life better.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com" target="_blank">Alfred</a>. Can’t imagine using a Mac without Alfred. It is my launcher, snippet manager, clipboard manager, and a whole host of other functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/" target="_blank">Keyboard Maestro</a>. I rely on this multiple times a day to perform repetitive tasks.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com" target="_blank">Hazel</a>. I tag a file/folder with some little tag. Hazel moves it to a different folder, removes the tag, and I go on with my life.</li>
<li><a href="https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge" target="_blank">Supercharge</a>. Sindre Sorhus makes a whole slew of useful applications for the Mac. Supercharge is but one example. Full of QOL improvements, it makes using the modern macOS tolerable. I am going to write a review of this program soon. Sindre is prolific and brilliant.</li>
<li><a href="https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/" target="_blank">iStat Menus</a>. Brilliant menu-bar application which lets me keep a lookout on what is going on with the Mac.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.homerow.app" target="_blank">Homerow</a>. Saves me from the mouse/trackpad. Brilliant program which lets me select options on the screen. Keeps my hands on the keyboard, where they belong.</li>
<li><a href="https://choosy.app" target="_blank">Choosy</a>. I use Safari and Chrome as my browser. Choosy lets me choose the browser to open a link with. Lets me also define the preferred browser for some URLS (e.g.&nbsp;YouTube URL’s open in Chrome)</li>
<li><a href="https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html" target="_blank">Lulu</a>. Replaced <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html" target="_blank">LittleSnitch</a> as my outgoing connections monitor. There was nothing wrong with LittleSnitch, I was trying to save some money and came across a free alternative. Lulu saved me the upgrade price of LittleSnitch. Lulu works great.</li>
<li><a href="https://obsidian.md/clipper" target="_blank">Obsidian Web Clipper</a>. Clips content from the web. Best clipper I have come across. If you are comfortable in the terminal, you might give <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/gather-cli/" target="_blank">Gather</a> a go. It also does a great job.</li>
<li><a href="https://ghostty.org" target="_blank">Ghostty</a>. I have been using Ghostty as my terminal application. It is fast and beautiful. I have also found <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/" target="_blank">Kitty</a> to be a great terminal. Haven’t yet decided between the two. Both are better than the stock Terminal application.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>I am looking forward to using and getting to know these two new products:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Written. A new product in beta from the Literature and Latte folks (they make <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview" target="_blank">Scrivener</a>). I like what I see so far.</li>
<li><a href="https://ia.net/presenter" target="_blank">iA Presenter</a>. This is a new application from the iA folks. I am using it and learning how to get the best out of it. Will cover the product when I am comfortable with it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>macOS 26 is a disgrace.</li>
<li>Emacs has been awesome for me.</li>
<li>Small independent developers still do the best work on the macOS platform. They make my life better. Thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to my readers. They keep me writing.</p>
