To commemorate Mitch Randall’s fine, although heavily drugged, preaching on May 11, 2014:
</p>

 <p>
Loving Father,
</p>

 <p>
We give thanks for the one who, <br></br>
although (relatively) young, <br></br>
complimented “Sarah” <br></br>
even though her name is Laura;
</p>

 <p>
Who, despite years of theological education, <br></br>
urged the congregation to turn to the “Book of Moses;”
</p>

 <p>
Who, having been unable to find Sarah <br></br>
in the congregation, <br></br>
tried in vain to find her in the Exodus story.
</p>

 <p>
And so, just as your power was demonstrated by the <br></br>
babbling of those accused of imbibing on Pentecost, <br></br>
may your love and grace shine through the <br></br>
fumbling of the one who may be <br></br>
over-medicated, <br></br>
but is <br></br>
much appreciated.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
