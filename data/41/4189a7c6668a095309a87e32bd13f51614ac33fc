<p>Dan Rogers, director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), used a rare public speech to warn that Russia and China have a “significant intelligence interest” in Canada’s Arctic and are targeting both government and private-sector actors in the region. Rogers also said CSIS this year intervened to foil potentially lethal threats by Iran against people based in Canada and blocked attempts by Russia to illegally acquire Canadian goods and technologies. His remarks — delivered during CSIS’s annual update — underscore Ottawa’s growing concern about foreign espionage and influence in the Arctic and the need to protect sensitive northern infrastructure and firms.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/doIb6f3KnbKnKmgrUW7ZOwfJLUFT0adybC-3Q1KXBtXad-oc-I_1biosJmHtZkrKXMUXA03XkYK7dwf9-QdyVKw_ASqqFPNWALDU2EGfJJU6YGlXhLDpI7w8V4ieW-rgm6asFq43FIHALCQ5wJPtNEjXrZf-HIIXSHw' alt='Canada&#x27;s spy agency raises concern over threats from Russia &amp; China in Arctic region' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>First confirmation: CSIS’s statement was the first public confirmation that the agency intervened to protect critics of Iran living in Canada after foiling potentially lethal plots this year</li><li>Public posture: Dan Rogers’ decision to speak publicly is notable because CSIS directors seldom give on-the-record annual threat speeches, signalling a more outward-facing communication approach</li><li>Arctic concern: Rogers told listeners hostile nations are growing increasingly emboldened in the Arctic, linking intelligence activity to broader strategic competition in northern latitudes</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS): Russia and China have a significant intelligence interest in Canada’s Arctic and are targeting both the government and private sector, CSIS warned in its annual address.
