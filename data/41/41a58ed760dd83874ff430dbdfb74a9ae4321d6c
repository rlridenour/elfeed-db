The release candidate version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> includes a new feature that lets you set an icon tint color that matches your  <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> case or your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>

When you long press on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> and then choose the customize option, there's a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; case icon at the bottom of the "Tinted" menu. Tapping it will automatically change the color of &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; icons to the color of the case that you're using.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this requires a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> case that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; recognizes, so it is essentially a feature designed to work with Apple cases. If you don't see a colorful &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; ring that matches your case color when you put your case on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, it's probably not going to work with icon tinting. You can also opt to change your icon colors to the color of your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by tapping on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; icon.<br/>
<br/>
Tinted icons in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; have a new Liquid Glass look with added translucency. Tints are applied to all icons and widgets on the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
You can still manually change the color of the tint, or choose a color from your wallpaper. &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is set to come out on Monday, September 15. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/ios-26-home-screen-tint-case-color/">iOS 26 Will Let You Match Your Home Screen Icons to Your iPhone Case</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-will-let-you-match-your-home-screen-icons-to-your-iphone-case.2465066/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
