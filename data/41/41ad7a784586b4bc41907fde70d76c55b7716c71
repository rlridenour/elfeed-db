Amazon this weekend has Apple's AirPods Pro 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;169.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. This is the lowest price that we've tracked so far in 2025, and Amazon is providing a late March delivery estimate for most residences in the United States.<br/>

Although we saw a better deal over the holiday season, it's very unlikely that all-time low price will return any time soon. Amazon's price today is still a solid deal on the AirPods Pro 2, which feature USB-C charging and Active Noise Cancellation.<br/>

You can also get the base AirPods 4 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHMNQ5Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;99.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;129.00. This one is another record low price, and we aren't currently tracking any lowest-ever prices on the model with Active Noise Cancellation.<br/>
