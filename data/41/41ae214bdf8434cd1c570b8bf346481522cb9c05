<p>One of its clients is Springer Nature, the publisher of <a href="https://link.springer.com/brands/springer/journals/philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many philosophy journals</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://philosophy.unc.edu/people/harry-lloyd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry R. Lloyd</a>, assistant professor of philosophy at UNC Chapel Hill, had an article accepted for publication in one of those journals, <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11229" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Synthese</em></a>.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s Straive doing with its <a href="https://www.straive.com/science-and-research-content-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aims</a> of helping publishers with &#8220;accelerating time-to-publish,&#8221; &#8220;empowering authors,&#8221; and &#8220;driving cost and operational efficiency&#8221;?</p>
<p>Well, in an email describing the publishing process he recently went through, Professor Lloyd used the phrase &#8220;nightmare experiences.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t sound good.</p>
<p>He says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Of course, one expects some common-or-garden incompetence from production companies, but unfortunately Straive takes this to a whole new level, introducing dozens of bizarre errors. For instance, in my articles they have: removed entire paragraphs; replaced several instances of the pronoun &#8220;one&#8221; with the numeral &#8220;1&#8221;; deleted countless possessive apostrophes; and removed numerous grammatically necessary connectives. (Oh, and they are also completely incapable of typesetting even basic mathematics.) One of my articles with Synthese had to go through six rounds of proofs, and even then Straive left errors uncorrected in the published version. </em></p>
<p>Professor Lloyd has a couple of questions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">1. How widespread are these problems? Have other authors had similar experiences?<br />
2. Are journal editors aware of these problems?</p>
<p>To these we might add:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Are journal editors given a choice in whether to use Straive?<br />
4. Have journal editors voiced concerns to Straive or to the publishers using it to, and if so, what have their responses been?<br />
5. What other firms are publishers using in this capacity, and which publishers?</p>
