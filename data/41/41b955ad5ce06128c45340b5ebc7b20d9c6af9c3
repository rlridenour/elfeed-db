<p>PJ Vogt, in a very fun episode of his podcast, Search Engine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A small group of Americans becomes convinced they’ve discovered
something strange about their iPhones: a forbidden phrase the
phone will refuse to transmit. A crack podcasting team searches
for answers, wherever they may lead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bug is that if you send an audio voice message in Apple Messages, and mention the name “Dave &amp; Busters”, the recipient will never receive the message. I had a good guess, right away, what was happening. But I don’t want to spoil it — it’s a fun listen.</p>

<p>But when you’re done listening, and you want a thorough explanation, <a href="https://rambo.codes/posts/2025-05-12-cracking-the-dave-and-busters-anomaly">check out Guilherme Rambo’s thorough investigation</a>. So good.</p>
