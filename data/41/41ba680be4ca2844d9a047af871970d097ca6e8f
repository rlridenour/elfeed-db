<p>That&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lukewilliamhunt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke Hunt</a>, associate professor of philosophy at the University of Alabama, during his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee&#8217;s Subcommittee on Oversight, on the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Before becoming a philosophy professor, Dr. Hunt was an FBI agent.</p>
<p>In his testimony, Dr. Hunt says that the FBI &#8220;should be an agency that promotes the rule of law,&#8221; and raises &#8220;three concerns about the current state of affairs that could lead to an erosion of the rule of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>These concerns are: arbitrariness in what the FBI investigates, the selective enforcement of corruption, and the influence of politics in responding to national security threats.</p>
<p>You can read his testimony <a href="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hunt.writtentestimony.4.2.2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, or watch it below. (His testimony, about five minutes long, begins at 1:11:55; the video below should start at that point.)</p>
