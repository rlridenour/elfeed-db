<p>The US Department of Homeland Security has proposed a new rule that would require visitors from around 40–42 visa‑waiver countries, including the UK, France, Australia and Japan, to submit up to five years of social media history before traveling to the United States. The plan, published by Customs and Border Protection in the Federal Register this week, would make disclosure of social media identifiers a mandatory part of the online Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), replacing the current optional questions about online accounts. Applicants could also be required to list email addresses used over the past decade, phone numbers from recent years, extensive family details and certain biometric information, which US officials say would strengthen national security screening and help identify violent or antisemitic content. Civil liberties advocates, privacy experts and tourism voices warn the proposal could chill free expression, deter visitors ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America, and create new risks if large volumes of personal data are mishandled. The public has a 60‑day window to comment on the draft rule before it can be finalized, giving travelers, rights groups and businesses an opportunity to shape how far the screening will ultimately go.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DOs3zkMPW6JGQvvAe2hyvdkf49vaQHaA7l2AUmb9UJFKC-AIiPfHcTs5Dn7hq_qblPdPYMty-F0pNM9SXC_7IfzdbEhYhKYr4f9iMSKskbba-feU8a8xa2bxHcxq_7XEgrf0MAr7Bkjlotq95bW-xvM5goPoOHlykBFgjnZ6sv1Gy3fdydJ4redeP2ZjmqFr7g2pCYfEDVy_' alt='Travelers queue at a US airport as new electronic screening rules are discussed.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who is affected: The proposal targets citizens of countries in the US Visa Waiver Program, who normally obtain travel authorization through ESTA instead of a traditional visa interview, meaning tens of millions of leisure and business travelers could be covered each year if the rule is approved.</li><li>Data being added: In addition to social media handles, CBP wants to collect so‑called “high‑value data fields” such as multiple years of phone numbers, a decade of email addresses, expanded family background and additional biometrics from these travelers, going beyond what ESTA currently requires.</li><li>National security rationale: US officials argue that routine checks of online activity can reveal signs of extremist ideology, anti‑American or antisemitic content and travel patterns that traditional document checks might miss, building on earlier expansions of social media screening for standard visa applicants in recent years.</li><li>Free speech concerns: Privacy scholars and civil liberties advocates fear that forcing visitors to hand over years of online identities could pressure people to self‑censor political views or criticism of the US government on social platforms, especially if they worry posts may be misunderstood at the border.</li><li>World Cup timing: Some analysts note that increasing entry hurdles ahead of the 2026 men’s FIFA World Cup, to be co‑hosted by the US, Mexico and Canada, may complicate plans for international football fans and add a political dimension to what organizers hope will be a festive global event.</li></ul><blockquote>The public has 60 days to comment on the proposal for travellers to reveal social media history as part of their application to enter the US. - Kim Rubenstein</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Department of Homeland Security / CBP: DHS and CBP present the expanded collection of social media, contact and family data as a way to enhance vetting of travelers from low‑risk countries and better identify potential security threats before they board flights to the United States.
