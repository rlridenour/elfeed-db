 
          <p>A lot has happened since the <a href="/post/2024/03/my-retro-desktop-setup/">desk setup post from March 2024</a>&mdash;that being I got kicked out of my usual cosy home office upstairs as it was being rebranded into our son&rsquo;s bedroom. We&rsquo;ve been trying to fit the office space into the rest of the house by exploring different alternatives: clear a corner of our bedroom and shove everything in there, cut on stuff and integrate it into the living room, &hellip; None of the options felt particularly appealing to me. I grew attached to the upstairs place and didn&rsquo;t want to lose the skylight.</p>
<p>And then we renovated our home resulting in more shuffling around of room designations: the living room migrated to the new section with high glass windows to better connect with the back garden. That logically meant I could claim the vacant living room space. Which I did:</p>

</p>
<p>Compared to the old setup, quite a few things changed.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s clear that the new space is much more roomy. But that doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean I&rsquo;m able to fit more stuff into it. After comparing both setups, you&rsquo;ll probably wonder where most of my retro hardware went off to: only the 486 made it into the corder on the left. I first experimented with replicating the same setup downstairs resulting in a very long desk shoved under the window containing the PC towers and screens. That worked, as again there&rsquo;s enough space, but at the same time, it didn&rsquo;t at all: putting a lot of stuff in front of the window not only blocks the view, it also makes the office feel cramped and cluttered.</p>
<p>That is why the desk is now split into two. The WinXP and Win98 machines have been temporarily stashed away in a closet as I still have to find a way to fit the third desk somewhere at the back (not pictured). Currently, a cupboard stray from the old living room is refusing to let go. We have some ideas to better organize the space but at the moment I can&rsquo;t find the energy to make it happen. I haven&rsquo;t even properly reconnected the 486 tower. The messy cables on the photo have been neatly tucked away by now, at least that&rsquo;s something.</p>
<p>Next, since I also have more wall space, I moved all board games into a new Kallax in the new space (pictured on the left). There&rsquo;s still ample space left to welcome new board games which was becoming a big problem in <a href="/post/2024/07/the-2024-board-game-shelf-analysis">the old shelf</a> in the hallway that now holds the games of the kids. On the opposite side of the wall (not pictured), I&rsquo;ve mounted the Billy bookcases from upstairs that now bleed into the back wall (pictured on the right). These two components are new: the small one is currently holding Switch games and audio CDs and the one on the far right is still mostly empty except for fountain pen ink on the top shelf.</p>
<p>The problem with filling all that wall space is that there&rsquo;s almost none left to decorate with a piece of art. Fortunately, the Monkey Island posters survived the move, but I was hoping to be able to put up something else. The big window doesn&rsquo;t help here: the old space&rsquo;s skylight allowed me to optimize the wall space. The window is both a blessing and a curse. Admittedly, it&rsquo;s very nice to be able to stare outside in-between the blue screen sessions, especially if it&rsquo;s spring/summer when everything is bright green.</p>
<hr>
<p>The new space is far from finished. I intend to put a table down there next to the board game shelf so that noisy gaming sessions don&rsquo;t bother the people in the living room. The retro hardware pieces deserve a permanent spot and I&rsquo;m bummed out that some of them had to be (hopefully temporality) stowed away. A KVM switch won&rsquo;t help here as I already optimized the monitor usage (see <a href="/tags/setup">the setup of previous years</a>).</p>
<p>My wife suggested to throw a TV in there to connect the SNES and GameCube but the books are eating up all the wall space and I don&rsquo;t want the office to degrade into a cluttered mess. I&rsquo;m not even sure whether the <code>2</code> metre long desk is worth it for just a laptop and a second screen compared to the <code>1.2</code> one I used before. The relax chair how used for nightly baby feeds still needs to find its way back here as well.</p>
<p>I imagine that in a year things will look differently yet again. Hopefully, by then, it will feature more <em>retroness</em>.</p>
