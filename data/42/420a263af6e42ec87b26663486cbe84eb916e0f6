<p>The Department of Philosophy at Columbia University has issued a statement about Mohsen Mahdawi, the <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/15/philosophy-major-snatched-by-ice-during-citizenship-interview/">philosophy major taken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) this past Monday.<span id="more-53499"></span></p>
<p>The statement, currently posted on the <a href="https://philosophy.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Philosophy website</a>, reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>It has come to the attention of members of the Department of Philosophy at Columbia University that one of our students, Mohsen Mahdawi, was detained in Vermont by agents of the Department of Homeland Security.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We express our horror and dismay at the fact that a legal resident of the United States&#8212;someone who has been accused of no crime&#8212;should be detained in this manner. We would like to convey our sympathy and our support to Mohsen, to his family, and to his friends.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We call upon the Provost and Acting President of Columbia University to assist by all means, including through the provision of material and legal resources, any Columbia student targeted or detained&#8212;and seemingly only for having exercised their right to the free and peaceful expression of political opinion.</em></p>
