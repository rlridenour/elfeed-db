<p>Another update to Casual has been recently made (<a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/releases/tag/2.8.0">v2.8.0</a>) which adds two new interfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Compile for <code>compilation-mode</code> and <code>grep-mode</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elisp for <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Belatedly, this post also announces an interface for Eshell which was released in <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/releases/tag/2.7.0">v2.7.0</a> without much fanfare. We’ll remedy this here.</p>
<p>The v2.8.0 update also does an overhaul of the documentation for <a href="https://kickingvegas.github.io/casual/">Casual</a>, emphasizing the usage of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/html_node/index.html">Texinfo</a> (by way of <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Texinfo-Export.html">Org</a>) to author it. A benefit for doing so is the ability to export its output to both Info and HTML.</p>
<h1>Casual Compile</h1>
<p>A common workflow is to use the <code>compile</code> command to run a command line tool, typically <code>make</code> (see also <a href="https://kickingvegas.github.io/casual/Make.html">Casual User Guide (make)</a>). If errors occur, then they are listed in a buffer named <code>✳︎compilation✳︎</code> which can be navigated upon. The major mode of this buffer is <code>compilation-mode</code> and it offers two ways to navigate this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving the current selection while simultaneously showing the selected error at its source in another window (aka “following” the selection.)</li>
<li>Moving the current selection only.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the keymap <code>compilation-mode-map</code> binds a number of its commands to use a modifier key (<code>M-</code> or <code>C-</code>) which is too much work for my taste. I prefer a single key binding when possible, so have made the following changes for Casual Compile:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">Default Binding</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Casual Binding</th>
<th>Command</th>
<th>Note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">M-p</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">k</td>
<td>compilation-previous-error</td>
<td>Use vi convention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">M-n</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">j</td>
<td>compilation-next-error</td>
<td>Use vi convention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">M-{</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">[</td>
<td>compilation-previous-file</td>
<td>Single key on <code>en</code> keyboard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">M-}</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">]</td>
<td>compilation-next-file</td>
<td>Single key on <code>en</code> keyboard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">C-o</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">o</td>
<td>compilation-display-error</td>
<td>Single key on <code>en</code> keyboard.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The menu for Casual Compile (<code>casual-compile-tmenu</code>) is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/images/announcing-casual-compile/casual-compile-screenshot.png"></p>
<p>This same menu also applies to Grep results when called from Emacs. This is because Grep output uses a major mode (<code>grep-mode</code>) that is derived from <code>compilation-mode</code>.</p>

<h1>Casual Elisp</h1>
<p>While I’ve been an Emacs user for decades, I’ve only been writing Emacs Lisp (Elisp) for about a year and half now. The menu I’ve created for Elisp is largely a collection of commands that I’ve found useful to have around when developing for it.</p>
<p><img alt="img" src="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/images/announcing-casual-compile/casual-elisp-screenshot.png"></p>
<p>This includes functions for evaluation, cross-referencing, byte-compiling, and balanced expression (sexp) navigation.</p>

<h1>Casual Eshell</h1>
<p>Eshell has a number of commands to help save you from typing too much. Probably my most favorite command is <code>eshell-insert-buffer-name</code> which will let you choose a buffer via completion. This command is mapped to the binding <code>B</code> in <code>casual-eshell-tmenu</code>.</p>

<li>Supports appearance changes (light/dark mode).</li>
<li>Responsive for both mobile and desktop screens.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
<p>Casual v2.8.0 was a big push, particularly with regards to the documentation. Please provide any feedback on any of the new features in the <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/discussions">discussions section</a> for it.</p>
<p>If you enjoy using Casual, please consider making a modest financial contribution to help support its development and maintenance. Thanks!</p>
