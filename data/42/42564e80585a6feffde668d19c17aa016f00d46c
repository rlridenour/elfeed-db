<p>Verizon, <a href="https://x.com/VerizonNews/status/2011820123154182420">in an announcement on Twitter/X</a> regarding their <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/14/verizon-out">daylong outage</a> this week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yesterday, we did not meet the standard of excellence you expect
and that we expect of ourselves. To help provide some relief to
those affected, we will give you a $20 account credit that can be
easily redeemed by logging into the myVerizon app. You will
receive a text message when the credit is available. On average,
this covers multiple days of service. Business customers will be
contacted directly about their credits.</p>

<p>This credit isn’t meant to make up for what happened. No credit
really can. But it’s a way of acknowledging your time and showing
that this matters to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got the text message last night (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2026/01/verizon-20-bucks.png">screenshot</a>), and redeemed it this morning. It wasn’t too hard to redeem, partly because I already had the My Verizon app installed and had my account credentials saved.</p>

<p>But you know what would <em>actually</em> be easy, and would <em>actually</em> acknowledge our time and show that this really matters to Verizon? If they just took $20 off every customer’s next bill. Automatic. Just take $20 off next month. If a good restaurant screws up an item you ordered, they apologize and take the item off your bill (and maybe give you a free dessert or something). They don’t give you a code to redeem.</p>

<p>It would also better show that they care if the text message spelled the app “My Verizon”, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-verizon/id416023011">which is the app’s actual name</a>.</p>

<p>As for how many days of service $20 covers, we pay $329/month for a “5G Do More” family plan for me, my wife, and son. Three phones, three Apple Watches, and two iPads. (I’m the one without a cellular iPad plan, because I so seldom use an iPad.) That’s about $11/day. Verizon only sent us one $20 credit, not three, so that covers roughly two days of service — which is, indeed, multiple days.</p>
