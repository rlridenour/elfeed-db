  <p>Over the decades, according to his website, Martindale either
hosted or produced 21 game shows, including “Words and Music,”
“Trivial Pursuit,” “The Last Word” and “Debt.” “That’s a lot of
shows,” he acknowledged in a 1996 interview with the New York
Daily News. “It either means everybody wants me to do their show
or I can’t hold a job.”</p>

<p>Martindale was best known for hosting “Tic-Tac-Dough,” the revival
of a late 1950s show, which aired on CBS for less than two months
in 1978 but continued in syndication until 1986.</p>

<p>Unlike tic-tac-toe, in which two players simply try to get three
Xs or three Os in a row in a nine-box grid, “Tic-Tac-Dough”
required contestants to select a subject category in each of the
nine boxes, everything from geography to song titles. Each correct
answer earned the players their X or O in the chosen box.</p>

<p>“Tic-Tac-Dough” achieved its highest ratings in 1980 during the
88-game, 46-show run of Lt. Thom McKee, a handsome young Navy
fighter pilot whose winning streak earned him $312,700 in cash and
prizes and a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>

<p>It’s funny what you remember from childhood. I was only seven then, but I remember McKee’s winning streak. He was like the proto Ken Jennings. There was some kind of gimmick on the show where if you won ten games in a row — which almost never happened — you also won a car as a bonus. So McKee won eight cars. As I recall it — I was seven, so I could be wrong — all eight cars he won were exactly the same model, because that was the show’s current promotional partner. I remember thinking that was absurd, and my dad explaining to me that he could just sell them.</p>

<p>Anyway, in one of my programming classes in high school, we had to create a big final project. We had to work in pairs because there weren’t enough computers for every student in the class. My friend and I wrote a tic-tac-toe game in Applesoft BASIC. (To be honest, I wrote most of it, but he did the typing.) I remember three things about that game:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We used the number pad keyboard layout for entering moves, with each numeral corresponding to a square on the board, which I thought (and still think) was a pretty clever UI for tic-tac-toe:</p>

<pre><code>789
456
123
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You could play two-player or against the computer, and while the computer was pretty good, it couldn’t play perfectly. I was very frustrated that while <em>I</em> could, of course, play perfect tic-tac-toe myself, I couldn’t figure out how to code an algorithm for unbeatable play in BASIC.</p></li>
