<p>I&rsquo;m knee deep in my RSS feeds and found out about the <a href="https://gregnewman.io/blog/emacs-carnival-2025-07-writing-experience/">Emacs Carnival for 2025</a>.</p>
<p>What I love about this is that the topic is writing experience, so the focus is not about elisp snippets and coding shenanigans. Instead, people tell their stories about how their writing got them into Emacs and why. Looks like I have some reading to do.</p>
