I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve all missed my Journelly posts. The thing is, it&rsquo;s working so well for me that I don&rsquo;t feel the need to comment about every little change but Álvaro Ramírez has <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/markdown-is-coming-to-journelly">just announced Markdown support</a>. That&rsquo;s nothing that I care about, of course, being a dedicated Org mode user but it&rsquo;s still important.
</p>
<p>
Even if you believe, as I do, that there&rsquo;s no reason for Emacs users to be slumming in the Markdown camp, there&rsquo;s no reason you have to be an Emacs user to take advantage of Journelly. Indeed, other than storing it&rsquo;s data in Org format there&rsquo;s nothing Emacs specific about Journelly and everyone—no matter their editor choice—can take advantage of it.
</p>
<p>
And, snark aside, there are plenty of Emacs users who, for one reason or another, need or prefer to work in Markdown so this latest change will be welcome to them. Even more to the point, it shows that Ramírez is committed to Journelly and making it valuable to as many people as possible. He&rsquo;s already shown this by rolling out new releases almost as fast as we can keep up with them
</p>
<p>
That brings me to another point that I haven&rsquo;t mentioned before. Ramírez—who is a full time, independent, app developer—makes Journelly available for a one-time fee instead of insisting on a subscription like many developers have started doing. I <i>really</i> hate the subscription model and am extraordinarily grateful to Ramírez for not using it.
</p>
<p>
But for that to work, Ramírez needs to get a critical mass of users to support his continued development of Journelly. His app is great and he deserves that support so that&rsquo;s why I may seem like a cheerleader for it. I use it and love and I, selfishly, want him to succeed so that Journelly will continue to evolve and get better. But even if it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s still a win for me.</p>
