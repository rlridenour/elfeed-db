<p>Clips is such an interesting story. It really was a great app. Back in 2017, when version 2.0 arrived (just six months after 1.0), <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/11/10/clips-2-0">I described it as</a> “the single best example of a productivity app designed for iOS”. I stand by that. Clips was a very ambitious app that really pushed the state of the art in iOS UI design forward in so many ways. The general knock on iOS has always been that it’s a platform for content consumption, not creation. Clips was <em>all about</em> creation.</p>

<p>But, for as many great ideas as Clips contained (and debuted), it clearly never clicked with the public. Most people — even just only counting people who create and share edited videos to social media — probably have never even heard of Clips. There was something essential missing: a use case. <a href="https://thatrandomagency.com/2025/06/09/instagram-edits-app-review/">Edits</a>, Meta’s new-this-year video editing app for mobile, has a clear use case: it’s meant for editing videos destined for Meta’s popular social media networks. Clips had no clear target destination. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/20/remember-clips">It could have</a>, but never did.</p>
