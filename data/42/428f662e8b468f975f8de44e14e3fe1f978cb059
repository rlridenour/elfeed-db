<p>The US Senate voted to advance a War Powers Act resolution that would require President Trump to obtain congressional authorization before taking further military action in Venezuela. The procedural vote passed with support from Democrats and five Republicans, setting up a final Senate vote expected next week. Lawmakers pushed the measure forward after US forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a raid in Caracas, an operation some senators say occurred without adequate consultation with Congress. While the resolution is widely described as largely symbolic—and would face long odds of becoming law—it signals renewed congressional interest in asserting oversight of US military action.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/5gF8-t-91XjDI4ZOQGvNRJz_J2dW1yl4Nq5RQjztedh_Dvwsscm2ByjvvCj8a7SJdurD8HveDOERt6N_kl-c0KQWaNYzjcXQUA0TSXdauvN0' alt='Sen.
