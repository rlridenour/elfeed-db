<p>George Kelly, The Standard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joe Betz, the owner of San Francisco’s House of Prime Rib, who
transformed the Van Ness Avenue restaurant into an institution
beloved by locals and visitors, has died. He was 86. […]</p>

<p>Joe Betz purchased House of Prime Rib in 1985 from Lou Balaski,
who founded it in 1949, and over four decades preserved its
old-world charm while building it into one of the city’s most
enduring dining destinations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My favorite restaurant in San Francisco, and one of my favorite restaurants anywhere in the world. Incredibly consistent excellent food, impeccable service, and a one-of-a-kind atmosphere.</p>
