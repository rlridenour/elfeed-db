 Edit 2023.001.17: fixed syntax errors CLI command in /usr/bin and username &gt; user  This is an update of a previous Babashka1 project2, changed because my organization has switched to a Palo Alto GlobalProtect VPN instead of our former Cisco one. Originally this posed a major problem for OpenConnect, which had troubles with GlobalProtect, but with wersion 9+ of OpenConnect it works smoothly (as long as your provider doesn&rsquo;t require SAML authentication, which is apparently still buggy in OpenConnect 9).
