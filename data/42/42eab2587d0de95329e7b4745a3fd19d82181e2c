<p>A weakened Hamas has carried out a wave of killings in Gaza since a ceasefire took hold, with at least 33 people reported dead as the group moves to reassert control [japantoday.com#1][scmp.com#1]. The crackdown has targeted alleged criminals and rivals; footage circulating online appears to show executions of alleged collaborators in a city square, and a separate clash in Gaza City’s Sabra neighborhood on Sunday left 27 people dead [timesofisrael.com#1][firstpost.com#1]. Hamas gunmen have returned to the streets, with the group citing crime and security concerns for its actions [japantoday.com#1][scmp.com#1]. President Trump suggested he gave Hamas a temporary green light to police the Strip during the ceasefire, and reporting indicates a perceived US nod to that effect, though renewed violence risks undermining the administration’s peace plan [timesofisrael.com#1][scmp.com#1][economist.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/1zf76fgi84h_BNtSUVkwcEC5fDIWnKeeOBCTBfIjykTVTY3NLP2RhnoTQXBvkYydgnUGEP6-aofPTAAome9B3sL3vPKsEZNIYPWSt97v3iLakyxvNGGgNcEvqKh7tM_9aEMw9DO7hCo5_0K7u9ff6c7raUXqhN3IWdok2D3e6GASUUvaCDkccD2fIztzU3X1pKreSW9IGI8np4UCD-j0M4QS' alt='A street in Gaza City as reports describe clashes and crackdowns following a ceasefire.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ceasefire context: Since a ceasefire began on Friday, Hamas has cautiously sent men back into Gaza’s streets [scmp.com#1].</li><li>Casualty toll: At least 33 people have been killed during the Hamas-led crackdown, according to multiple reports [japantoday.com#1][scmp.com#1].</li><li>Doghmush clash: A gun battle in Gaza City’s Sabra neighborhood on Sunday left 27 dead, involving Hamas and members of the Doghmush clan [firstpost.com#1].</li><li>Executions reported: Footage appears to show Hamas executing alleged collaborators in a public square [timesofisrael.com#1].</li><li>US involvement: President Trump suggested a temporary green light for Hamas to police the Strip during the ceasefire, with reports of a perceived US nod [timesofisrael.com#1][scmp.com#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Hamas: The group says it acted due to crime and security concerns as it reasserts control.
