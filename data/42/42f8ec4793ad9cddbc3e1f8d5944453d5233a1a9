GRID Studio creates art showcasing Apple's history from old, discarded Apple products that would otherwise clutter up landfills. GRID Studio collects vintage Apple devices, disassembles them, and designs attractive wall art for Apple fans. Art pieces are available with a range of <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/collections/iphone">different iPhones and Apple products</a>, so if you have a favorite device, you can likely get a collector's version from GRID Studio's website. GRID has everything from the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13. You're not limited to iPhones, though, and GRID also <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid-ipad-1st-generation">offers iPads</a>, <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-ipod-classic-2nd-generation-">iPods</a>, <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/collections/apple-a-series-chips">A-series chips</a>, the first <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid-macbook-air-1st-generation">MacBook Air</a>, and <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/collections/smartwatch">Apple Watches</a>.<br/>

Each GRID frame features a deconstructed Apple device with all of the components carefully laid out and labeled. There are also useful facts and relevant details about each product, along with a Steve Jobs quote. Most frames are around 11 inches by 16 inches, with some smaller square versions also available.<br/>
