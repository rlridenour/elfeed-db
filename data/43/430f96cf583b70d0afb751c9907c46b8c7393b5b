Apple today provided developers and public beta testers with a second release candidate version of tvOS 26.2 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> Software 26.2, which is based on tvOS. The second RC comes one day after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/apple-seeds-watchos-26-2-rc/">the first RC</a> and has a build number of 23K53, up from 23K51. <br/>

tvOS 26.2 can be downloaded through the Software Update section of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> settings app.<br/>
<br/>
With tvOS 26.2, Apple is adding support for creating a profile without an Apple Account, and there is a dedicated &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app kids mode that's available for children's profiles.<br/>
<br/>
Apple doesn't provide beta release notes, so it's not clear what's changed between the first RC and the second RC. Typically, release candidates are updated if there is a major bug discovered during the testing period. RCs represent the final version of the software that will be released to the public.<br/>
