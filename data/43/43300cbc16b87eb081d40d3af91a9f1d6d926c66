<p>When did analytic philosophy begin? Many who ask that question answer: 1879, the year Gottlob Frege&#8217;s <i>Begriffsschrift</i> was published.  But how did Frege, a math professor whose studies originally focused on geometry, do it? Is it true that &#8220;Frege created logic and analytic philosophy out of nothing&#8221;?<span id="more-55937"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s how <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/PhilSem/mitglieder/lemanski.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jens Lemanski</a> (University of Münster) puts <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/04/remembering-michael-dummett/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Dummett</a>&#8216;s influential view, en route to offering an alternative explanation of how Frege came to develop the ideas that make him such an influential figure in the history of philosophy: it was his dad.</p>
<p>Not only that, but, as the title of a recent article by Lemanski in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/thpl20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>History and Philosophy of Logic</em></a> puts it, &#8220;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01445340.2025.2593810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frege&#8217;s Father Was a German Idealist</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>So is analytic philosophy fundamentally a son&#8217;s rebellion against his father? Perhaps Freud, a contemporary of Frege&#8217;s, would have said so, but humorous as that would be, that&#8217;s not Lemanski&#8217;s thesis at all.</p>
<p>Rather, Lemanski argues that &#8220;Gottlob Frege&#8217;s father Alexander studied with a philosopher from the broad circle of German idealism and tried in several writings to apply and continue his philosophy himself. This new source not only elucidates Gottlob Frege&#8217;s familiarity with post-Kantian philosophy, but also has the potential to explain logical influences, such as that of Leibniz.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a brief excerpt:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I believe that the historical material presented here has resolved the long-standing speculation as to how a mathematician like Frege was able to acquire such knowledge of philosophy or why he was interested in philosophy at all. This does not mean, of course, that all or most questions about Gottlob Frege&#8217;s philosophical background have now been clarified. However, this historical material elucidates the plausibility of representing theses that were previously deemed implausible, such as the influence of the notations of Leibniz or [Karl Christian Friedrich] Krause on Frege. It is conceivable that Gottlob Frege encountered a notation similar to that of </em>Begriffsschrift <em>for the first time in his father&#8217;s lecture notes from Göttingen.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We can also vividly imagine this influence by certain scenarios: It is not implausible that Alexander Frege utilized a notation similar to Krause&#8217;s and Leibniz&#8217;s to elucidate the rudiments of logic to his son during their shared breakfast table discussions. It is probable that many philosophers and logicians will be familiar with such experiences from their own family lives. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>And since Alexander Frege had at least integrated Krause&#8217;s ideas into his language teaching and since his wife was also a teacher at the Höhere Töchterschule, we can imagine that there were more intense intellectual debates in the parental home, which Gottlob was influenced by.</em></p>
<p class="last" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As Kreiser rightly points out, Frege&#8217;s parents exerted a significant influence on their son&#8217;s intellectual and professional development (Kreiser 2001, 176). This assertion is corroborated by the evidence presented in this study. However, it was only when the newly accessible material was examined that the full extent of this influence became apparent. The late work of Alexander Frege, in particular, points to a bibliophile or at least a universally erudite personality. Based on the sheer number of references in Alexander Frege&#8217;s late work, there is no reason to assume that his son had no knowledge of philosophy, only limited access to philosophical texts, or that he created his logic and philosophy out of nothing. The evidence presented here indicates that both Alexander and Gottlob shared a wide range of interests, influences and contacts&#8230; Consequently, should future research not dogmatically reject the close connection between post-Kantian philosophy and analytic philosophy, these traces, which have only been hinted at here, have to be further explored.</em></p>

<p>Frege is not the only notable figure in the history of philosophy who had a philosopher as a parent&#8212;Leibniz and Mill come to mind&#8212;who are some others?</p>
