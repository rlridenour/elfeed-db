<p>There was a fence with spaces you<br />
Could look through if you wanted to.</p>
<p>An architect who saw this thing<br />
Stood there one summer evening,</p>
<p>Took out the spaces with great care<br />
And built a castle in the air.</p>
<p>The fence was utterly dumbfounded:<br />
Each post stood there with nothing round it.</p>
<p>A sight most terrible to see.<br />
(They charged it with indecency.)</p>
<p>The architect then ran away<br />
To Afric- or Americ-ay.</p>
