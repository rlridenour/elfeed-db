The Emacs mode line contains a wealth of information, much of which I depend on daily. Some of that information is what the major mode is and what minor modes are active. Again, that&rsquo;s often useful information. Still, there are plenty of minor modes that I don&rsquo;t care about, either because they&rsquo;re <i>always</i> enabled or because they simply don&rsquo;t matter to my workflow.

For a long time, the standard way of dealing with that was the diminish command that would prevent a given minor mode from appearing on the mode line. The problem was that it sometimes didn&rsquo;t work and, at least in my experience, every update of a package would reset the diminish function to off for that mode.

Relief is finally—or at least will be—here. Coming in Emacs 31 is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1k7zxjv/fyi_modelinecollapseminormodes/">mode-line-collapse-minor-modes</a>. The idea is that you will list in a single variable those minor modes you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> want to appear on the mode line or, optionally, those you <i>do</i>. By default those modes excluded are represented by a single <code>...</code> on the mode line. You can click on that to see a list of the hidden modes.

As I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12896">said before</a>, I usually have two side-by-side windows in a single Emacs frame. That means that there&rsquo;s not a lot of room on my mode line so getting rid of less important information is essential to me. Diminish has worked reasonably well for that but I&rsquo;ll be glad to have a simpler way of handling the problem. Emacs 31 is still sometime away but it&rsquo;s something to look forward to.</p>
