         <p>In this video, I talk with Amin Bandali about free software, free
knowledge, the importance of community and the commons, and life in
Canada. Our discussion starts with the topic of EmacsConf, the annual
conference about GNU Emacs. Amin has helped organise a few of those
and I ask what kind of work is involved. As Amin contributes to other
free software communities, I get to learn how the GNU and Debian
projects work, especially with regard to getting involved with the
work they do—and they can always benefit from more volunteers. After
we cover free software, we switch to free knowledge. In this part,
Amin tells me about The Internet Archive, what it is, how and why it
is useful in our life. In the final part of the video, I ask about
life in Canada, where Amin lives. It is an informative chat which also
has a lot of funny moments.</p>
