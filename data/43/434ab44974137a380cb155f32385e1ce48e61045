<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Yup, there&rsquo;s problems with emails.  But so is there problems with other collaboration tools.

<p>Eden writes about folks forgetting to send emails BCC (Blind Carbon-Copy) and
revealing sensitive information.  That is, email is easy to cause privacy
problems.</p>
<p>This passage stuck out as a brief, yet unexplored, defense of email.</p>

There are, I&rsquo;ll admit, some advantages to email. The most prominent being that
the receiver can <em>permanently</em> store a copy. Notwithstanding inept attempts to
recall an email (which often highlights its sensitivity) an email delivered is
an email stored. That is undoubtedly useful for the recipient.

<p>In an era of rising revisionism—just wait and see how much worse 2025 will
be—permanently storing a copy is valuable; look at the utility of the Internet
Archive and how its under attack (hacks and distributed denial of service).
Having a source that is less prone to external revision is a distinct feature.</p>
<p>I’m in the habit of capturing web pages, storing them and referencing them
locally (though exporting them publicly).

,
stores the content locally (and I back those local files up).  That is, I’m
trying to keep receipts.</p>
<p>And email is a ubiquitous communications platform; a lingering analogue process
that maintains a sense of ownership.  But there is nothing quite like a group
email that has lost the thread, shedding and adding participants, forking
conversations.  A glorious reminder that digital conversations are hard;
regardless of medium.</p>
<p>Turning back to the examples of privacy breaches regarding email; how many times
in 2024 did we hear about cloud files being incorrectly secured and thus world
visible.  But email is a bit different, it’s <em>faux paus</em> are visible to its
receivers.  Whereas those cloud transgressions are opaque to those whose privacy
is compromised.</p>
<p>I also remember reading a shared document that had allowed me to view its
revisions.  And saw that the document started down one path, and changed
direction after what I knew to have been a high-level leadership meeting.  Words
and framing changed.  And based on how the document was released, I’m certain
they did not want to share the internal conversations.</p>
<p>I think to an aphorism I once heard at a preservation working group:
“Information wants to be free.”  That implies agency of the information, when in
reality, anything we write digitally can easily propagate far and wide.</p>
