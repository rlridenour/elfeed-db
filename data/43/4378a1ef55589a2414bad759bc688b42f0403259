Here is what Goodall says in the ad:<blockquote>Every story you love, every invention that moves you, every idea you wished was yours, all began as nothing. Just a flicker on a screen, asking a simple question: What do you see?</blockquote>Apple's video description on YouTube:<blockquote>From groundbreaking discoveries to award-winning films — all of it starts from nothing. Endless possibility is waiting, what will you make with it? Great ideas start on Mac.</blockquote><a href="https://adage.com/creativity/work/aa-apple-great-ideas-start-on-a-mac/"><em>Ad Age</em> shared a quote</a> from Tor Myhren, Apple's Vice President of Marketing Communications:<blockquote>This campaign celebrates the hardest and most mysterious part of a great idea—its origin: how something is created out of nothing, from a blank canvas. It's remarkable how many of the world's great ideas started on a Mac. This work salutes these ideas, and everyone who tries to make more of them.</blockquote>Goodall passed away earlier this month, at the age of 91.<br/>

Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1973478920428364123">paid tribute</a> to her remarkable life:<blockquote>Jane Goodall was a groundbreaking scientist and leader who taught us all so much about the beauty and wonder of our world. She never stopped advocating for nature, people, and the planet we share. May she rest in peace.</blockquote><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/20/apple-great-ideas-start-on-mac-ad/">Apple Says &#039;Great Ideas Start on Mac&#039; in Ad Voiced by Dr. Jane Goodall</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-great-ideas-start-on-mac-in-ad-voiced-by-dr-jane-goodall.2469454/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
