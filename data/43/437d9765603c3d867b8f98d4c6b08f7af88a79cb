<p>&#8220;I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn&#8217;t any privacy.&#8221; &#8212; Jordan Baker in <em>The Great Gatsby</em></p>
<p>&#8220;At any gathering I always feel as though I am the youngest person in the room.&#8221; &#8212; W.H. Auden</p>
<p>&#8220;The difference between what is commonly called ordinary company and good company, is only hearing the same things said in a little room or in a large saloon, at small tables or at great tables, before two candles or twenty sconces.&#8221; &#8212; Pope, <em>Thoughts on Various Subjects</em>, 1727</p>
