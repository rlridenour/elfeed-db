Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
For those times <br></br>
when we hear <br></br>
the ridicule, <br></br>
the jeers, <br></br>
the insults, <br></br>
and see the looks <br></br>
of pain and loneliness, <br></br>
yet stand in uncomfortable silence, <br></br>
and do nothing,
</p>

 <p>
Lord have mercy.
</p>

 <p>
And for those times <br></br>
when we strike back <br></br>
at those who hurt us, <br></br>
and start another <br></br>
cycle of violence <br></br>
that has no end in sight,
</p>

 <p>
Christ have mercy.
</p>

 <p>
The powerful rested <br></br>
easy on their thrones, <br></br>
when the things of God <br></br>
were bought and sold <br></br>
on the marketplace; <br></br>
for the temple <br></br>
was their palace, <br></br>
and its religion <br></br>
was their power.
</p>

 <p>
Lord Jesus, <br></br>
storm into our lives <br></br>
as you did the temple; <br></br>
may the chains be broken, <br></br>
the tables turned, <br></br>
and our hearts set free.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
