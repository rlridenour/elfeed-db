<p>The Sunday Times of London ran a good excerpt from Patrick McGee’s <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/56320/9781668053379">Apple in China</a></em> (<a href="https://stocks.apple.com/A9MEOjMcuTmymeN9ncI88kw">News+ link</a>, in case you need it):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ripple effect from Apple’s investments across Chinese industry
was accelerated by a rule imposed by Apple that its suppliers
could be no more than 50 per cent reliant on the tech giant for
their revenues. This was to ensure that a supplier wouldn’t go
bust overnight if a new Apple design did away with components it
manufactured. So as iPhone volumes soared from under ten million
units on its launch in 2007 to more than 230 million in 2015,
Apple would encourage its suppliers to grow their non-Apple
business just as quickly. The upshot of this policy was that Apple
gave birth to the Chinese smartphone industry.</p>

<p>In 2009 most smartphones sold in China were produced by Nokia,
Samsung, HTC and BlackBerry. But as Apple taught China’s supply
chain how to perfect multi-touch glass and make the thousand
components within the iPhone, those suppliers took what they knew
and offered it to Chinese companies led by Huawei, Xiaomi, Vivo
and Oppo. Result: the local market share of such brands grew from
10 per cent in 2009 to 35 per cent by 2011, and then to 74 per
cent by 2014, according to Counterpoint Research. It’s no
exaggeration to say the iPhone didn’t kill Nokia; Chinese
imitators of the iPhone did. And the imitations were so good
because Apple trained all its suppliers.</p>

<p>To get this message to Beijing, Tim Cook and his deputies visited
Zhongnanhai, the citadel of communist power near the Forbidden
City, in May 2016. They explained that Apple wasn’t just creating
millions of jobs; it supported entire industries by facilitating
an epic transfer of “tacit knowledge” — hard-to-define but
practical know-how “in the art of making things”, as defined by
the China-born Federal Reserve economist Yi Wen, who believes that
such knowledge was “the secret recipe” behind Britain’s Industrial
Revolution.</p>

<p>A former Apple executive says this message was “music to the ears
of China”. Beijing had spent decades trying to catch up with the
West’s lead in advanced industry, scientific research and
economic might. It often resorted to spying, outright theft or
coercive tactics. But here was America’s most famous tech giant
willingly playing the role of Prometheus, handing the Chinese the
gift of fire.</p>

<p>McGee’s book was in the works for years, but the timing of its publication couldn’t be more serendipitous, with Trump’s stupid tariff war.</p>
