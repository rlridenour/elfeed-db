The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> Messages app is set to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-messages-and-phone-features/">gain support for customized backgrounds</a> for conversations, and it appears that AI will be an option for generating different looks.<br/>

According to <a href="https://x.com/nicolas09F9/status/1931066422115057811">Nicolás Alvarez</a>, &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; code suggests that users will be able to generate backgrounds for the Messages app using text-based descriptions. The feature appears to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, and there will be &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; style options that include Animation, Illustration, and Sketch.<br/>
<br/>
The Messages backgrounds will be customizable on a per-conversation basis, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac users will be able to set a different background for each of their message threads. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> previously said that the backgrounds will sync between all participants in a Messages conversation. So if you set a specific background for an iMessage chat with a friend, the friend will see the same background.<br/>
<br/>
Other messaging apps like WhatsApp support custom background options, so Apple is playing catch-up with the new Messages app background feature.<br/>
<br/>
The Messages app is also set to gain support for polls, automatic translation for incoming messages in other languages, and the option to create <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a> by combining two existing standard emoji. Apple plans to call the &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; mixing feature "Mixmoji." With this feature, you will be able to combine two emoji such as cake and balloons into a new emoji that features a cake and a balloon for a celebration.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has other AI features in the works, such as an Apple Intelligence-powered version of the Shortcuts app. Apple could call the new Shortcuts option "Generative Shortcuts," and it appears it will use natural language to help users create powerful multi-step shortcut actions.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and the new Messages features will be shown off at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a>, which is set to begin on Monday, June 9 with a 10:00 a.m. keynote event.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-ai-backgrounds-mixmoji/">iOS 26 Getting Custom AI-Generated Message Backgrounds, Generative Shortcuts and &#039;Mixmoji&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-getting-custom-ai-generated-message-backgrounds-generative-shortcuts-and-mixmoji.2458311/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
