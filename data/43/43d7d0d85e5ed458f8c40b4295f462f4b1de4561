<p>European Union member states are set to vote on finalizing a long-negotiated trade agreement with the Mercosur bloc of South American countries, after Brussels offered last-minute concessions aimed at winning over undecided capitals such as Italy. In France, the debate spilled into the streets as farmers drove tractors into central Paris and blocked major approaches to the city, saying the deal could expose them to cheaper food imports and worsen already-high costs. President Emmanuel Macron said France will vote against signing, arguing the agreement would bring only limited growth benefits while risking agricultural sectors, even as the EU works on additional safeguards and funding pledges. The moment is a reminder that big international deals often move forward best when they also make room for local livelihoods—and negotiators are still trying to strike that balance.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/1EyInFE-qfsZTftjDizjWk7y4KoasKCHign0RcjJQ5ce4huCQqRoZsbyl4LI-wxY6lPpTx2J4QSpq-b952wZDb-756iDagAJ5OfI1NkyNwr34xkBisECJeNAHvlzmPqjacyvxVKeSezYhjsvHZSJJ7UoVvordzGWO2aU-S8HfH6qIH-fV6OyT6wmWIb1FcHpAVq4xPY_uz9iNL2fMvQxO60qE7bVZBRCruPjJErvzvlqU-zcASHt3jKcgwCkcfIBC-Ul4N_xd_Q776WjYg' alt='Coordination Rurale head Bertrand Venteau speaks to demonstrators outside France’s National Assembly in Paris during protests over the Mercosur deal (Jan. 8, 2026).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Traffic disruption: France’s transport minister said the tractor blockades helped trigger about 150 km of traffic jams on routes into Paris, including the A13 from the western suburbs and Normandy.</li><li>Checkpoint push: Organizers said farmers overran police checkpoints to enter Paris before dawn, then drove along the Champs-Élysées and gathered near the National Assembly.</li><li>Disease culling: Protesters also demanded an end to what they called excessive government culling of cattle in response to a highly contagious cattle disease, which they link to broader pressure on farm incomes.</li><li>Assembly tensions: National Assembly President Yaël Braun-Pivet was booed and jostled as she came outside to speak with Coordination Rurale protesters.</li><li>Approval math: Politico reported that France and Poland lack the numbers to block the deal if Italy backs it at the key vote, underscoring how a few capitals can decide the outcome.</li></ul><blockquote>We are between resentment and despair.
