<p>Prime Minister Mark Carney&#x27;s minority Liberal government narrowly secured parliamentary approval for its first federal budget on 18 November 2025, winning a confidence vote that averts a snap election. The high‑stakes fiscal plan, described by sources as deficit‑boosting, was presented as a response to US tariffs that Ottawa says threaten Canadian exporters and the wider economy. The measure passed with help from opposition abstentions and divisions, allowing Carney to keep his government in office for now without a majority in the House of Commons.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/OFAwOnk78lZSzuevt-z8U2VmEj7HOOca8kl25AWM1t6kD-VmJn8_NvwpEXgRleNxTRVy21S503Q8fLOGFSmwi2I_rjWlbXAn6Q99V21HSPtW6yfSA49e6I7Ctb8FvaErbLN-KH82VvASguHaQgSxg6BZOhfTcQ9gLBdTPVwhi9aI75dh68mRzJOgdYpoZBQL08XUb94Jh-rNwOJBAfi63fMr9dQ8r7gx7YiLO5L8jjL7QdxX5Ur86ItQOoI1PqfOcGHGMSR43Jdv' alt='Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister Mark Carney rises to vote in support of the federal budget in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, November 17, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Parliament arithmetic: The Liberals remain a few seats short of a majority in the 343‑seat House of Commons, so they depend on other parties or abstentions to win confidence votes.</li><li>Carney&#x27;s milestone: This was Mark Carney&#x27;s first federal budget as prime minister, making the vote a test of his early governing mandate.</li><li>Budget scale: Media reported the fiscal plan as the second‑largest in Canada&#x27;s history, underlining its ambitious size and political stakes.</li><li>Timing factor: Reports noted some MPs were reluctant to trigger a holiday‑season election, a practical consideration that shaped abstentions and voting choices.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Liberal government (Prime Minister Mark Carney): The budget was framed as a necessary, deficit‑boosting response to economic threats from recent US tariffs aimed at protecting Canadian exporters and jobs.
