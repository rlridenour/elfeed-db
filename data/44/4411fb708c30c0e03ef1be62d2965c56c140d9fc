<p>Haiti’s Transitional Presidential Council has ended its mandate and handed presidential powers to Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, leaving him with executive authority as of February 7. The handover follows a tense stretch in which the council tried to remove him about two weeks earlier. He stayed in place and is expected to keep leading the government as Haiti prepares for its first general elections in about a decade. The shift comes as Port-au-Prince remains in the grip of a severe security crisis. Gangs control large parts of the capital, and the United Nations recorded thousands of killings in 2025.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uLAXKGi4PVx3yGkxqjEWNIqBFavo5whKwzV3MGikmbBzsPh-VV70VNcqJwBvW11dRkzBkJqJ3WX0ktftCCgiXWZtV9BTSaGI7MM1pJ_D2KenNKS_GxmM5o7u_lmyleIrWhmq6uQ7PALL1_vkEs9-_bmtfSwL9HvnFUq5HChIQrCEWlCQ72nXRBJG6mdJyI9Qd8vKdi083WIemNBpWLgZc3GlzOzU0IZ2HA19f96LYzJuja5L5wsIFeg' alt='Haiti&#x27;s Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils Aimé in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, February 7, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Council dissolves: ABC News said the council dissolved after nearly two years of tumultuous rule, handing authority to the prime minister.</li><li>US-backed framing: Al Jazeera framed the transfer as consolidating power in the hands of a U.S.-backed prime minister.</li><li>Election challenge: Le Monde and DW said organizing elections will require buy-in from a polarized political establishment.</li><li>Political limbo: DW and RFI described the post-handover moment as political limbo in a violence-ridden country.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Al Jazeera: Al Jazeera framed the handover as strengthening a U.S.-backed prime minister and reported a recent U.S. warship deployment near the capital’s waters amid the crisis.
