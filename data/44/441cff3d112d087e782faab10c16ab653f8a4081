<p>It doesn’t take too long a look at the almost surrealistically clean-lined buildings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gropius">Walter Gropius</a> to get the impression that the man wanted to usher in a new world, especially when you consider that many of them went up before World War II.&nbsp;Take the <a href="https://bauhaus-dessau.de/en/venues/bauhaus-building/">Bauhaus Dessau building</a>, which, though completed exactly a century ago, looks like a concrete transmission from the future that never arrived, or one that may indeed still be on the way. It once housed the <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2019/02/bauhaus-world.html">German art school</a> turned political and cultural engine he founded in 1919, whose principles included absolute equality between male and female participants — or they did at first, at any rate.</p>
<p>Soon deciding that the new institution wouldn’t be taken seriously with too high a proportion of women, Gropius limited their enrollment to one-third of the student body. That episode, among others that underscore the ways in which Gropius and the Bauhaus’ ostensible commitment to the advancement of women wasn’t all it could be, figures into Susanne Radelhof’s documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PshQs7LLNiw"><em>The Untold Story of Bauhaus Women</em></a>.</p>

<p>Yet whatever the shortcomings in that department one might identify from a twenty-first century vantage, the fact remains that the Bauhaus made possible — or at least encouraged — more enduring and influential work by female artists and designers than almost any art school in early twentieth-century Europe.</p>
<p>Among the almost 500 women who studied at the Bauhaus, the film profiles figures like Alma Buscher, “who created prototypes of avant-garde furniture and toys”; “visionary metalsmith and designer” Marianne Brandt; Gunta Stölzl, whose “weaving revolutionized modern textile design” (weaving eventually being the main program to which women were admitted); Friedl Dicker, a “multitalented artist” dedicated to the Bauhaus; and Lucia Moholy, whose “exceptional photographs still influence how we view Bauhaus design today.” The school itself may have shut down in 1933, owing to the conflict between its aesthetic and political ends and those of the rising Nazi Party, but the forward-looking nature and worldwide cultural influence of the Bauhaus have ensured that we still feel the influence of its alumni, male and female alike.</p>
