From lightning-fast navigation in Notes to creating Spotify-style stations in Apple Music, and securing your Time Machine volumes inside encrypted APFS containers, this episode is loaded. You’ll rearrange CarPlay apps like a pro, check your battery with Siri, and streamline iCloud Mail aliases. And if you haven’t played with ChatGPT’s new voice mode recently, you’re missing out—it’s weirdly friendly.</p>
<p class="p1">Then it’s a hard turn into real-world snags, like when JP’s HomePod stopped being a Home Hub—Don’t Get Caught like he did. Adam tries—and fails—to merge his Apple IDs, raising red flags for developer account holders. Cool Stuff Found includes retro-modern turntables from Victrola (this month&#8217;s MGG giveaway!) and a handy AirPods noise guide. Listener questions dig into hostname quirks and CarPlay glitches, and the crew weighs in on Apple’s 2026 OS betas. Pilot Pete gives iOS 26 a solid 95%, so maybe it’s time to test the waters—maybe just not on your main device?</p>
