The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> features the first redesigned form factor that Apple has come out with in several years, but it's not without compromises because of its thin design. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera has been using the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; as his main device for the last two weeks to see if those compromises are worth dealing with day-to-day.<br/>

The "awe" feeling of using a lightweight, compact <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> doesn't go away over time, and it's still a delight to use such a thin device. 6.5 inches is an ideal screen size, and even though it's a large phone, it's not heavy. If you've ever had hand strain from using a brick-like &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pro or Pro Max, the Air will be a relief. It's just all-around easier to hold than Apple's heavier iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the matte black &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; accumulates fingerprints and smudges, which is a problem when you're using it without a case. The lighter colors like white, gold, and blue look less grimy over time. In practice, Apple's new sky blue color is such a light shade that it's almost white with just a hint of blue.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;'s strong titanium frame <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/23/iphone-air-17-pro-drop-tests/">isn't going to bend</a>, based on multiple tests. The Ceramic Shield 2 at the front is more resistant to scratches, and the Ceramic Shield at the back also holds up better to drops. It's more durable, which is a good thing for a device you might not want to put a case on.<br/>
<br/>
Apple swapped titanium for aluminum in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models because aluminum is better at dissipating heat, but the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; still uses titanium for durability. Like the titanium <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; can get warm to the touch. There is a noticeable difference between the A19 Pro in the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and the A19 Pro in the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; when it is under heavy load, and there is occasionally some throttling on the Air.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; has the smallest battery of the 2025 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup, but some people may be able to get through the day without needing to recharge. The battery lasts longer than the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; battery, but it doesn't come close to the battery life you can get with the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max or even the 17 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Another major compromise is the camera. The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; has a single-lens Fusion camera, which is basically the same as the main wide-angle camera in the other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models. You don't get ultra-wide images, Telephoto images, or macro photos, plus there's no option to capture spatial photos and videos for the Vision Pro. If you're someone that uses more than the wide-angle lens, you might miss the versatility you get with other iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
At &#36;999, the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is &#36;200 more than the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and &#36;100 less than the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;, so it's an expensive device that does cause you to lose out on some features. It's the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to get if you want to prioritize thin and light over everything else, but you can get more functionality by spending &#36;200 less or &#36;100 more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/30/iphone-air-two-week-review/">Two Weeks With the iPhone Air: Is Ultra-Thin Worth the Compromises?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/two-weeks-with-the-iphone-air-is-ultra-thin-worth-the-compromises.2468012/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
