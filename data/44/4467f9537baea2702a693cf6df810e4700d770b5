<blockquote>
  <p>But digital advertising revenue hasn’t made up for the fall in ad
dollars going to traditional broadcast programming. Spending on
linear advertising for the late-night segment on ABC, CBS and NBC
fell from $439 million in 2018 to $221 million in 2024, according
to Guideline, an ad-tracking platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a precipitous decline, if accurate. But still, given that Colbert’s <em>The Late Show</em> has consistently been the highest-rated overall and tied with ABC’s <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em> for the 18–49 year-old demographic, it feels very safe to presume that it generated at least a full third — say, $75–80 million — of that $221 million total. It’s reported that Colbert’s salary is $20 million per year, and Colbert himself said the other night the show employs 200 staff.</p>

<p>If, as anonymous CBS sources are claiming to multiple outlets, the show lost $40 million last year, that means it costs something on the order of $120 million per year to produce, or $100 million after Colbert’s salary. With a staff of 200 people, that’s an <em>average</em> salary of $500,000. I know it costs money to heat and cool the Ed Sullivan theater, and I’m sure there are other costs. But there is no way the average salary of a staff member on the show is half a million per year.</p>

<p>And, even if somehow <em>The Late Show</em> <em>did</em> lose money last year, it seems implausible that CBS wouldn’t first ask for budget cuts — staff reductions, a salary cut for Colbert, whatever else might possibly be running up a $120 million/year budget — before just shutting the whole thing down. NBC’s <em>Late Night With Seth Meyers</em> <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/seth-meyers-late-night-8g-band-budget-cuts-1236034409/">sadly cut the live studio band last year</a>, for example. $75 million per year in ad revenue is way down from its <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/08/23/colberts-late-show-ready-to-challenge-fallons-ad-revenue/">Letterman era heyday</a>, but that’s surely more than enough to produce a talk show. Also, all of this back-of-the-napkin budget analysis neglects to assign any promotional value to the show. CBS gets to promote everything else on the network to over 2 million people per night with house ads during commercial breaks and guests on the show from other CBS programs.</p>
