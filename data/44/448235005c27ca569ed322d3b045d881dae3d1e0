<li>Supportive memory foam that holds you just right.</li>

<li>Control it with the remote; smart memory setting included.</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita? It can make a margarita more ergonomic.</li>
</ul><h1>Posture for the People</h1><p>You know, it seems like they could just make seats and chairs that properly support your back in a natural position that’s good for your body.</p>
<p>Well…they do. But you have to buy a really high-end chair or a <em>really</em> high-end car to get the experience. It’s basically like the ergonomics industry has decided that healthy posture is a premium feature that can command a bunch of extra money, kind of like how health insurance deals with teeth.</p>
<p>So posture for the few and back pain for the many. Groovy.</p>
<p>Besides, what does the ergonomic industry know anyway? When computers first became a thing they immediately came to the conclusion that this new technology inexplicably required us <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sleekform_Kneeling_Chair.jpg">to kneel in a weird backward chair to operate it properly</a>. Then a few decades later you get to today, where they’re like, “to hell with it, we’re just going to make the desk go up and down so that you can shut up and stand there until you get so annoyed that you’re happy to go back to slouching in a crappy office chair.”</p>
<p>It’s madness. We just want to have a good sit.</p>
<p>Well this product, dear reader, delivers a good sit.</p>
<p>It’s powerfully ergonomic and significantly adjustable. It has all the space-age support of memory foam, plus an onboard air pump to inflate the whole thing to your exacting specifications, all at the press of a button.</p>
<p>You charge it via USB, control it with the remote, and can even set up a memory setting for go-to ergonomic situations like “aggressively composing an email” or “video game final boss.” You could also use your smart setting for more slothful postures like “audio-only conference call” or “Netflix: hour four.”</p>
<p>It’ll fit your life, is what we’re saying. And your back. Retails for $99. Yours for way less.</p>
