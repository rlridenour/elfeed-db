<p><code>dired</code> can do most things for me especially now I have my DWIM image conversion scripts working and <code>image-dired</code> configured to my liking.</p>

<p>However sometimes I do just prefer using a GUI file manager; for example, drag and drop, image file preview e.t.c.</p>
<p>I am currently using the Dolphin file manager on KDE and one context menu service that I have enabled and use often is the <strong>Duplicate Here</strong> function.  It is often that I like to back up a file / directory to a quick temporary directory especially when I am hacking around with the original and on windows it is often that I copy and then paste with Windows automatically applying a <code>Copy</code> to the original name.  Dolphin does something similar but applies a <code>(1)</code> when it suggests a new name.</p>
<p>Enough rambling!, simply I would like to reproduce this functionality in <code>dired</code> but with the improvement of not adding in spaces to the new name and being able to define any unique naming convention I like.</p>
<p>So in <code>dired</code> to achieve this, simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>open dired</li>
<li>cursor over the desired item to rename</li>
<li><code>w</code> (dired-copy-filename-as-kill)</li>
<li><code>C</code> (dired-do-copy)</li>
<li>paste from the kill ring (yank)</li>
<li>modify the filename as desired</li>
<li>return</li>
</ul>
<p>pretty simple and uses all standard <code>dired</code> functionality and of course can be converted to a macro for a certain reproducible naming conventions and then maybe an attachment to a keybinding.</p>
<p>Note that it might be worth adding the following to your emacs init file so no confirmation will be required when copying directories:</p>
