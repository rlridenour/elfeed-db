The other day, I mentioned that I took a long, excruciating train trip. The outbound trip had been so bad that we were confident the trip home would be much better. It wasn&rsquo;t, of course. Most of you, I&rsquo;m sure, don&rsquo;t care very much and those outside the U.S. can snicker and gloat that at least <i>their</i> trains can provide a pleasant experience.

There is an aspect of the whole misadventure that should concern most Irreal readers, though. The Amtrak Website. It&rsquo;s horrible and turns the idea of being user hostile into an art form. Rather than dwell on the trip, I was going to crawl off into a corner and do my best to never think of it again. But then I saw <a href="https://xkcd.com/3175">this xkcd comic</a>. As he so often does, Munroe perfectly captured the infuriating futility that one feels when dealing with websites designed by those suffering from psychopathy.

Again, I&rsquo;m sure the details won&rsquo;t interest most Irreal readers so I&rsquo;ll spare you. Suffice to say, avoid their Website if you can.</p>
