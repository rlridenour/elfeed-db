<p>macOS Tahoe is ending support for <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2017/07/the-tragedy-of-firewire/">FireWire</a>, formerly Apple’s high-speed transfer bus of choice. Stephen Hackett <a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/07/tahoe-no-firewire/">put in the work</a> to confirm things:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It has been reported that macOS Tahoe doesn’t include support for FireWire devices. To see for myself, I dug out an old FireWire 800 drive I used to use in my Apple service tech days….</p>
<p>  On my Sequoia machine, the volumes all appeared in Finder and System Information app, under FireWire. When I moved the drive over to my MacBook Air running macOS Tahoe, it was a very different story. With the dongles in place, I held my breath, but it was in vain.

<p>Stephen’s adapter chain was a FireWire 800 cable to a Thunderbolt 2 adapter to a Thunderbolt 3 adapter to a MacBook Pro. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/01/reading-disks-from-1988-in-2018/">A while back I did something similar</a>, but I took it all the way back to a digital camcorder from Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt to FireWire 800 to FireWire 400 to a Sony iLink cable.</p>
<p>Now I just need to remember that macOS Sequoia is the latest OS that I can use if I ever need to reach back to a FireWire device again…</p>
