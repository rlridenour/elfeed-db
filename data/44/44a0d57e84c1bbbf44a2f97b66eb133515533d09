<p>&#8220;I don’t believe that arguing is usually the way we come up with good ideas. Argument might be an effective way of deciding which ideas to believe in. But adjudication is not creation. Safety inspections are important for deciding whether a building is sound. But safety inspections on their own don’t erect the building to be inspected.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s <a href="https://axdouglas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Douglas</a> (St. Andrews), in his newsletter, <em><a href="https://axdouglas.substack.com/p/arguments-everybody-chill-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As Difficult as Rare</a>, </em>writing about philosophical creativity. He says &#8220;there&#8217;s a balance to be struck between regulating philosophical ideas through standards of argument and nurturing the creativity that generates ideas in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>He adds:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Arguments are, at best, the regulatory structure of philosophy. But we often tell our students that the regulatory structure is the thing itself! I think that this is dangerous. Students come away with the notion that their job is to argue for/against ideas, rather than to generate the ideas to argue for/against&#8212;that they are the building inspector rather than the builder, the accountant rather than the investor&#8230;  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Not only can this intimidate people out of developing powerful, interesting ideas for which they don’t yet know if they can argue, it can also lead people into accepting the wrong ideas: those that meet current standards of argument, even when those standards miss some crucial insight&#8212;the philosophical equivalent of asbestos fireproofing. The greatest danger is that an overregulated thought-environment can quash the insight that would reveal the mistake in the regulations before it ever gets to appear.</em></p>
<p>Many years ago, <a href="https://patriciamarino.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patricia Marino</a> (Waterloo) wrote in a <a href="https://dailynous.com/2015/03/04/creativity-and-criticism-guest-post-by-patricia-marino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guest post here</a> about how she &#8220;wanted to go beyond criticism.&#8221; She says: &#8220;I wanted to create something, and I wanted to take a stand not only on what I thought was wrong, but on what I thought was right.&#8221; Making a point similar to the one Douglas makes in the last line, above, she adds, &#8220;Lately&#8230; I feel like I’m running up against the limits of creativity in philosophy. One major problem with it, it seems to me, is that it seems to require framing your new thing with some accepted background framework or set of ideas or posing of the question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://religiousstudies.indiana.edu/about/faculty/mcleod-alexus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexus McLeod</a> (Indiana Bloomington), <a href="https://dailynous.com/2022/02/16/creativity-and-pluralism-in-philosophy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking in defense of pluralism in the discipline</a>, writes, &#8220;Philosophy at its best is a kind of intellectual exploration, and the more methodological and stylistic constraints are placed on it, the less well it will function as such.&#8221; And <a href="https://www.michaela-mcsweeney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michaela McSweeney</a> (Boston University), in an interview, once <a href="https://dailynous.com/2018/04/20/the-creativity-of-philosophy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>, &#8220;I think of philosophy as partly a creative process and discipline, and I think it would be a tremendous shame if we lost sight of that part of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>If there is indeed &#8220;a balance to be struck between regulating philosophical ideas through standards of argument and nurturing the creativity that generates ideas in the first place,&#8221; one might ask <em>where </em>in the profession the need for this balance is most glaring.</p>
<p>Is it in the teaching of philosophy? If so, how does one better teach for imagination or creativity in philosophy?</p>
<p>Is it in an overcautiousness that comes from the demands of publishing and the gauntlet of peer review? What remedies are available there?</p>
<p>Is it in a failure to read philosophy for its creative aspects? If so, who are our exemplars of creativity in philosophy?</p>
