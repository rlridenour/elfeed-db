<p>Venezuela announced a nationwide military mobilization of nearly 200,000 personnel and ordered land, air, naval and reserve forces onto full operational readiness after the U.S. carrier strike group led by the USS Gerald R. Ford entered the Caribbean region this week; Caracas framed the move as a defensive response to a U.S. military buildup. The U.S. administration says the Ford was redeployed to Latin America to disrupt narcotics trafficking and has conducted multiple maritime strikes in recent months that critics say have killed dozens, drawing regional outcry and legal questions. International diplomats and rights groups are publicly debating the legality and aims of the campaign, while U.S. officials at the G7 defended the strikes and rejected allied criticism.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/A7FjR4eFTSmGSswPuZizElo1hVIy7AzTCY8vJVyrTcAxoN7qHpA8i84T5soW7KSAaZdtlTFFnSRcvucleWqyEB10ls0rMEEQGjnMkWAcoOEj-fhIrPPN7AqOnZNzyTFST9CuwY8LeMw' alt='U.S. naval forces, including the carrier Gerald R.
