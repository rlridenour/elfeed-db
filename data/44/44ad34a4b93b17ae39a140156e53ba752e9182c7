<p>I've written about <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec">macosrec</a> before. A tiny macOS command line utility I built to <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way">take screenshots or videos of my macOS windows</a>. Sure, there are a gazillion utilities out there, but I wanted my own, so I could bend and integrate with Emacs buffers as needed.</p>
<p>If you've seen me post a screenshot or gif after April 2023, it was likely taken with <code>macosrec</code>.</p>
<p>As of <code>macosrec</code> v0.7.3, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a> was added to the mix. I've also added a couple of <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command">dwim-shell-commands</a> (<code>dwim-shell-commands-macos-ocr-text-from-desktop-region</code> and <code>dwim-shell-commands-macos-ocr-text-from-image</code>), so I can do things like:</p>
<h2>OCR region</h2>
<p>Use the mouse to select a region to OCR.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/ocr-those-buffers/ocr-region.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>*This gif area recording was captured via macOS's built-in <code>screencapture</code>.</p>
<h2>OCR dired files</h2>
<p>Selecting any file (or files) in dired OCRs the whole lot.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/ocr-those-buffers/ocr-files.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>*This gif window recording was captured via <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec">macosrec</a>.</p>
<p>Invoking <code>dwim-shell-commands-macos-ocr-text-from-image</code> from the current image buffer does the job also.</p>
<h2>What about non-macOS users?</h2>
<p>The same approach can be used with any other OCR command line tool. <code>dwim-shell-command</code> includes <code>dwim-shell-commands-tesseract-ocr-text-from-image</code>, which uses <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdoc">tesseract</a>.</p>
<p>While I've had more reliable results via <code>macosrec</code> (using macOS's Vision API), I'm sure there are other great alternatives on linux. If you know of one, <a href="https://indieweb.social/@xenodium">I'd love to hear</a>.</p>
<h2>Available on github</h2>
<p>Both <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec">macosrec</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command">dwim-shell-command</a> are on GitHub and installable via <code>brew install xenodium/macosrec/macosrec</code> and <a href="https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command">MELPA</a> respectively.</p>
