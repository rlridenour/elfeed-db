One of the killer features of <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-for-ios">Journelly</a> for many of us is that Journelly&rsquo;s data is stored as Org Mode markup and that this data is easily synced to the iCloud so that it can be shared among all your devices, including a Mac. That means that you can display and edit the Journelly data just like any other Org file.
</p>
<p>
It also means that you can make an Org Mode template to add entries to the file right from your Mac. When you do, the entries will show up in the Journelly app just as you&rsquo;d expect. That&rsquo;s significant because it means you can take Journelly notes from any of your devices.

Early on, while the app was still in beta, <a href="https://baty.net/posts/2025/04/journelly-org-mode-backed-journaling-for-i-os/">Jack Baty wrote about a template he was using</a> for just this purpose. Ramírez, of course, had his own version. A limitation of both versions was that they didn&rsquo;t capture the location and weather information. Baty remarked that it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to add that and I remember thinking it was something I should do as soon as I got  a chance.

It turns out that it&rsquo;s a bit harder than I thought. Ramírez has a <a href="https://xenodium.com/a-richer-journelly-org-capture-template">new post that shows how to do it</a>. Part of the problem is that access to the weather APIs on the Mac require an API key and there&rsquo;s apparently no easily accessible API for location so Ramírez had to use third party apps for both of these. Even so, it didn&rsquo;t take much code and now he has a template that captures data and displays it in Journelly just as if it had been entered there in the first place.
