<p>The European Research Council (ERC) has launched a new &#8220;Ambassadors for the ERC&#8221; program.<span id="more-53770"></span></p>
<p>The selected Ambassadors &#8220;will serve as influential advocates for frontier research in Europe, engaging with policymakers, the media, and local research communities to promote and safeguard its value,&#8221; the ERC announced.</p>
<p>Together, the Ambassadors form a network that will &#8220;promote the importance of frontier research funding to policymakers, media, and local communities&#8221; and &#8220;share insights about ERC funding opportunities and champion the mission of the ERC,&#8221; <a href="https://aerg.eu/ambassadors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> the Association of ERC Grantees.</p>
<p>Thirty-two ERC grantees have been selected as Ambassadors for the ERC from 21 EU Member States as well as five Associated Countries: Israel, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK. The new ambassadors work across various disciplines, including the sciences, social sciences, engineering, and the humanities.</p>
