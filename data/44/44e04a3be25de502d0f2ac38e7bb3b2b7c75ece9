<p>The United States accused Russia of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of the war in Ukraine after Russia launched a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile, a move raised at an emergency UN Security Council meeting. US officials warned the strike risked widening and intensifying the conflict, as President Trump’s administration says it is trying to push negotiations toward peace. The Oreshnik launch was reported as occurring near Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO member, adding to broader regional concerns about spillover risks.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/4w-HGA_9gz6ISj2FNEH5AIgkkJ7xFRB7Lx2EN3c5RLBLn0SdDGW6QDruo7WCuvGcDh8UTTEHufdW_k7mNqsV7On1duvPS1ND2uelZJwgylCV4QbyE3fUD0A2IzNcMeHHMGMTy7C10OhHbrSy8NgiB31cBq530zzHuMDxAdV7lJWmMDx0WH5NtoZMzHndeZE7gw48V4h-ew' alt='Photo accompanying reporting on the US warning at the UN as President Trump seeks peace talks.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>UN forum: US Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce delivered the US critique during an emergency UN Security Council meeting convened after the missile launch.</li><li>Deadly strikes: Alongside the Oreshnik discussion, the reporting described new deadly Russian strikes in Ukraine as the diplomatic exchange unfolded.</li><li>Rare criticism: One account characterized the administration’s public condemnation as a rare instance of the Trump administration criticizing Russia in this war context.</li><li>Peace push: The US framing linked its warning about escalation to an effort by President Trump’s administration to advance talks aimed at a negotiated peace.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States: US officials described the Oreshnik launch as a dangerous escalation that could expand and intensify the war, while stressing a parallel push for peace negotiations.
