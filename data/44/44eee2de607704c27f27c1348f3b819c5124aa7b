<p>Summer is here, and with it, a slightly slower pace of news. <span id="more-54058"></span></p>

<p>This is just a heads-up that for the next few months here at DN posting will tend to be a little lighter, responses to emails may take a little longer, and the authorship will be a bit more varied.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, the <a href="https://dailynous.com/tag/summer-guest-post-series-2025/">summer guest post series</a> is beginning.</p>
<p>Guest posts will appear on Tuesdays&#8212;starting today&#8212;and the posts will remain pinned to the top of the page for a few days to encourage discussion. There may be bonus guest posts on other days, too (we&#8217;ll see).</p>
<p>There will continue to be news posts, but these will generally be handled with less urgency. Readers are still, as usual, encouraged to send in news tips, post ideas, and stuff worth linking to.</p>
<p>I hope all of your summers are off to a good start!</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/06/03/summertime/">Summertime</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
