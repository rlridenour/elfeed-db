<p>Leaders at the Asia‑Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju wrapped up after U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on the sidelines and agreed to dial back some trade and technology measures under a one‑year truce, easing immediate tensions between the world’s two largest economies . Trump left the main leaders’ meetings early after the talks, while Xi stayed and used the forum to call for stronger multilateral trading rules and to propose a global body to govern artificial intelligence . Separately, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he apologised to President Trump over an anti‑tariff ad; Trump said he would not resume trade talks with Canada and announced additional tariffs, a dispute that interrupted bilateral negotiations at the summit .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/LZ5oqZOFvPll2DilAiJUmAWfuvnFOI8wRYfZiosZKJbHdBgO71-J5cxyVUcUXMbXX013ojZFM3neJmwGwd4s4Aj_zePTvqnLecuQyJVuTGJr' alt='China’s President Xi Jinping shakes hands with South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung during the APEC summit in Gyeongju, Oct. 31, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Xi’s summit pitch: Xi framed China as a defender of rules-based trade, urging leaders to &quot;pull together&quot; and warning that rapid global change demands deeper cooperation .</li><li>APEC policy moves: APEC economies adopted declarations on artificial intelligence and demographic change, signalling coordinated attention to long-term economic challenges beyond tariffs .</li><li>U.S. representation: With President Trump departing early, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke for Washington at the forum, saying the administration is &quot;rebalancing&quot; trade relationships for stronger growth .</li><li>China hosting 2026: Xi announced Shenzhen will host the 2026 APEC meeting and said China will push AI cooperation during its chairmanship next year .</li></ul><blockquote>The rougher the seas, the more we must pull together. - Xi Jinping</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>China (Xi Jinping): China should protect global trading rules, pursue deeper economic cooperation and build a World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation to make AI a global public good .
