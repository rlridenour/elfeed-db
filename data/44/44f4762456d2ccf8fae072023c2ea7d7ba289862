<p>President Trump said he secured an agreement from Russian President Vladimir Putin to pause strikes on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities for about a week, with the pause framed in several reports as lasting until February 1 amid extreme winter cold and heating outages in the capital. The Kremlin also said Trump requested a halt on strikes on Kyiv until February 1, though multiple outlets noted the exact terms, scope, and enforcement mechanisms remain unclear. Despite the claimed pause, Ukraine reported continued overnight attacks involving a missile and large numbers of drones, and separate reporting described Russia striking elsewhere in Ukraine while Kyiv experienced a quieter night than previous ones. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly welcomed the idea of de-escalation but stressed he saw no formal truce and said Ukraine would respond in kind only if Russia actually complies, as diplomats prepare for another round of trilateral talks involving Russia, Ukraine, and the United States in Abu Dhabi on February 1.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/OpP9istbv_kRZxN1DwyoMw9l1T-qcW1G59jR1Qe3vv9E9wBHFxLKRM91wrsDk5hhKsoefMG3cZYXbOOaE767jimNuJ117NGm8jToH6OwvmcSyE4l5bFrXzwyh-c0wGqHWWAwJUcOwiE7yuAH4_tIjGbGwyap-w0BvlYtZwEsmhZOOe_GWukyxfPaRR2c0sJM951yrmwfeBYoh1kqus9WNChHZOrl_gSGclwsd6jTQ0NIU6MXyJQLUoO9IJcPUoxlL6ETZOhE0XC00hreOQ' alt='An emergency service truck stands next to an apartment building hit during overnight Russian drone strikes in the Kyiv region, January 28, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Energy focus: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the restraint as a partial suspension of long-range strikes on Ukrainian targets, framed as a way to “create favorable conditions for negotiations,” and said he would not detail whether Kyiv made reciprocal commitments.</li><li>Cold snap: Semafor reported forecasts of temperatures in Ukraine dropping to about -24°C (-11°F) over the weekend, underscoring why heat and power outages have become especially urgent.</li><li>Attack pattern: RFE/RL reported that Russia launched a ballistic missile and more than 100 drones overnight and that none struck Kyiv, highlighting the gap between reported targeting and actual impacts in the capital.</li><li>Targets shift: The Straits Times reported Russia said it would keep striking what it called Ukrainian “logistics,” even as it paused strikes on Kyiv until Feb 1 at Trump’s request.</li><li>Negotiation track: PBS said Trump announced a temporary halt in attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, but reported that details about timing and scope remained unclear.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States (President Trump): President Trump said Putin agreed to a temporary pause in strikes on Ukrainian cities/energy targets during extreme winter conditions.
