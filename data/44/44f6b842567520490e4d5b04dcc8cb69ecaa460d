<p id="p2">Today, <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-premium-lite/" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube introduced</a> a new version of its premium service called Premium Lite. YouTube Premium has been around for a long time offering ad-free video viewing, downloads, and the ability to listen in the background for $13.99/month in the U.S.</p>

<p id="p4">With Lite, YouTube is offering a more affordable version of Premium for $7.99/month. The new tier will still include ads for music and music videos and it won&rsquo;t let you download videos or play them in the background; however, other video categories will be ad-free.</p>
<p id="p5">It&rsquo;s good to see YouTube offer something at a lower price point. YouTube Premium&rsquo;s price has crept up in recent years, and the features that Lite leaves behind seem like natural break points in the service. For some users, YouTube <em>is</em> music, in which case, they&rsquo;ll want the full Premium plan to avoid ads. For others like me, who use YouTube occasionally for music, $7.99 is a significantly better deal, though I&rsquo;d prefer if background play was part of Lite, too.</p>
