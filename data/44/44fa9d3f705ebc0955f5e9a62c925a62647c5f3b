<p>Only 5.7 percent of anagrams in English are &#8220;maximally shuffled,&#8221; meaning that no letter retains its original neighbors. And even those rarely produce such pleasing symmetry when they&#8217;re diagramed like this. This is the largest &#8220;perfect&#8221; star anagram found in a systematic search by Jason Parker and Dan Barker; for more, see the link below.</p>
