<p>Fun look at <a href="https://make3.co/work/woemeter">prop construction for the most recent episode of <em>Severance</em></a>, “Chikhai Bardo” (careful, some spoilers).</p>
<p>Firm make3 was asked to build a device called the Lumon Woemeter, which bears a more than passing resemblance to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter">certain pseudoscientific device</a>; they did so in just six weeks.</p>
<p>It’s powered by an ESP32 (the same chip in my <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/11/creating-a-smart-on-air-sign-with-an-e-ink-display/">E-ink On Air sign</a>, which I’ve been messing around with more recently) and uses some knobs and switches salvaged from vintage audio tape recorders, combined with 3D printed components and a custom printed circuit board.</p>
<p>I love this melding of old and new tech; it fits perfectly in the aesthetic of the show. And I particularly appreciate how design-oriented the team behind the show is.</p>
