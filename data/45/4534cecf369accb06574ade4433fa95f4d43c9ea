In a <a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">new post</a>, the leaker listed the battery capacities of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11-pro/">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> through to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max, and added that the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max will feature a battery capacity of 5,000mAh: <br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 11 Pro Max</strong>: 3,969mAh</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 12 Pro Max</strong>: 3,687mAh</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro Max</strong>: 4,352mAh</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 14 Pro Max</strong>: 4,323mAh</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>: 4,422mAh</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max</strong>: 4,676mAh</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong>: ~5,000mAh</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The battery life of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max is 33 hours, according to Apple. This is up from 29 hours on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro Max, and 28 hours on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro Max. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a> had a battery life of just 20 hours. With an extra 300mAh of battery capacity, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max could be on course to offer around 35 hours of battery life, or perhaps even more. Efficiency improvements from the A19 Pro chip and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X80 modem should also contribute significantly to enhanced battery life.<br/>
