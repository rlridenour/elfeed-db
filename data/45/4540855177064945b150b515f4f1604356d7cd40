Problem As laid out on reddit1, I arrange my orgmode notes as single files with lots of entries. This works great for me because emacs is more buffer-oriented than directory-oriented, so all the emacs search commands optimize for single-file approaches (eg search all headlines in my tech/blog file for the keyword of that Linux function I&rsquo;ve forgotten how to use).
The single problem I have is footnotes. From the documentation you have two options: inline or in a file-wide section.
