<p>Professor Lavers worked on issues at the intersection of philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics and the history of analytic philosophy. He is the author of <i><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/abs/mathematics-is-mostly-analytic/290F213C5D2CDE15EF1ECF5C9D83AA51" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/abs/mathematics-is-mostly-analytic/290F213C5D2CDE15EF1ECF5C9D83AA51&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1747396445456000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0rfYdMe2X9tIzfKhETj3nP">Mathematics Is (Mostly) Analytic</a></i>, published this past January, as well as many articles, book chapters, and encyclopedia entries, which you can learn more about <a href="https://philpeople.org/profiles/gregory-lavers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://concordia.academia.edu/GregoryLavers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Greg Lavers joined the <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/philosophy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Philosophy</a> at Concordia in 2005, which he had earlier attended as an undergraduate. He earned his PhD and MA in philosophy from the University of Western Ontario.</p>
<p>Colleagues have commented on his gentle kindness, his calm, and his generosity. One relates how he was admired and beloved by students for his formal logic course, sharing this detail:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>he had a unicycle he’d bring into this first logic class and give the first lecture, or at least a good part of it, on the unicycle, to make the point that something that looks hard becomes easy with practice&#8212;and that logic is something you can do well at if you realize what it takes for that is practice. To ease students in to it. And he did that. And they surely liked the unicycle prof.</em></p>
<p>Greg Lavers died on May 10th, 2025, from cancer. He was 50.</p>
