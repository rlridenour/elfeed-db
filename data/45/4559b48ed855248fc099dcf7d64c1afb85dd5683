<p>I&rsquo;ve been building a <a href="https://github.com/ashton314/lambda-x86">compiler</a> for a small lambda calculus that compiles to x86. It&rsquo;s pretty broken, and I decided to start from scratch. I checked out a new branch in Git, and then <strong>deleted</strong> the entirety of my compiler before I had a chance to do anything else.</p>
<p>It hurt. But it was a good kind of hurt.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t usually just blow everything away like that. Even this time, I&rsquo;m keeping many of my auxiliary functions. I&rsquo;m not rewriting the parser or some of my x86-helper routines. Those can stay.</p>
<p>I just wanted a blank slate. It&rsquo;s nice having Git because I know I can always go back, but I&rsquo;m not sure I will. I might glance back at my old branch occasionally, but by and large I&rsquo;m starting fresh.</p>

<p>Fresh starts are important. I think one silver lining found among the clouds of this COVID-19 madness is that this is a chance to start fresh for so many people. Yes, it&rsquo;s hard, and yes, there is lots of sadness, uncertainty, and grief. Take advantage of your life being paused and let this be a fresh start for <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>My wife is working on a writing habit. I&rsquo;m working on developing research-oriented habits. I&rsquo;m trying to read a paper every day—it&rsquo;s not going <em>super</em> well, but I am improving!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark enough outside. Look for the silver lining and start fresh.</p>
