<p>News from Apple’s Podcasts for Creators site, regarding new features in the iOS 26.2 beta releases:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you supply chapters in your episode description or in your
RSS feed, they display in Apple Podcasts. If you submit chapters
through your hosting provider, you can include images. For shows
in English, when chapters aren’t provided, Apple Podcasts
generates them for you and an “Automatically created“ label
appears in the chapter list. If you prefer not to use
automatically created chapters, you can disable this feature in
Apple Podcasts Connect. <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/5482-using-chapters-on-apple-podcasts">Learn more about chapters</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s unclear to me whether this feature is actually exclusive to iOS/iPhone, or will be available across Apple’s 26.2 OS releases. This strikes me as a great use of AI, but I also think most multi-topic podcasts should include human-created chapters.</p>
