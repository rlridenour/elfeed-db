Like most longer term Emacs users, one of the first things I did was to get rid of the annoying long-form Yes/No questions that required you to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; explicitly. That was easy to do. I simply aliased <code>y-or-n-p</code> to <code>yes-or-no-p</code>. The same code is in virtually everybody&rsquo;s <code>init.el</code> if they started before Emacs 28.
</p>
<p>
Starting in Emacs 28, the variable <code>use-short-answers</code> was introduced. When non <code>nil</code> it causes <code>yes-or-no-p</code> to call <code>y-or-n-p</code> to ask the question instead of following its normal path.

Lennart Karssen over at <a href="https://www.polyomica.com">Polyomica</a> recently discovered this <a href="https://www.polyomica.com/weekly-emacs-tip-23-configure-emacs-to-accept-short-answers/">and wrote a short post about it</a>. He, like almost everyone else hates the long answers. They&rsquo;re there for a reason, of course, and the documentation for the variable recommends against setting it non <code>nil</code> but I doubt very many folks follow that advice.
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;ve had my original aliasing code for at least 17 years and see no reason to change it. When <code>use-short-answers</code> was first introduced, I thought I should adopt it but I never did and as far as I can see, it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference.

<p>
In the unlikely event that you weren&rsquo;t aware of how to turn off the requirement for entering long answers, take a look Karssen&rsquo;s post or just check the documentation for <code>use-short-answers</code>.</p>
