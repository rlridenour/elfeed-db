<p>Myanmar’s military authorities opened polling stations on Sunday for the second phase of a multi-stage national election, expanding voting to additional townships, including some affected by ongoing fighting. The vote is the first general election since the 2021 military takeover, and it aims to elect seats in the country’s bicameral legislature, with another phase expected later in January. Critics including the UN, Western governments and human rights groups argue the process lacks credibility because major opposition forces are absent and conflict and displacement limit participation. Even so, many people who can safely reach polling sites are using the day to make their voices heard, underscoring how strongly communities still value having a say in Myanmar’s future.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/NzJu4VTm5-mtPCZZllzXy5u0pbr8Q3mzA1YR3WdHaNg5CHSSsJjIIko7x8scI1Qi3V3UvSdrn6ZwdftPmpoB_ky39mERp7ci2dnW-aLJZ9JLEYhNn66oBeSycGx_5MYU0DOEzfN4nF2Yq57wsfyuHNhfm43Cake4qgPVWM3JLg' alt='Voters participate in Myanmar’s second round of voting amid armed conflict.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Where voting expanded: This phase opened polling in about 100 townships, according to the military-run election plan described by regional reporting.</li><li>Turnout claims: Military authorities said the initial round drew 52% turnout, a figure reported by Al Jazeera as voting continued.</li><li>On-the-ground reality: In Hpapun, once a busy town with an airport, residents and armed conflict have emptied the area, and reporting described voting there as largely symbolic.</li><li>Opposition restricted: PBS reported that major opposition parties were barred and prominent leaders jailed, which critics say prevents meaningful competition.</li><li>Legitimacy debate: Deutsche Welle reported the junta is promoting the election as a return to democracy, while critics say it is designed to legitimize military rule.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Myanmar military authorities: They present the multi-phase election as a step toward restoring democratic governance and normal political administration.
