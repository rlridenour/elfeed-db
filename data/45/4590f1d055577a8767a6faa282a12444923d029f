Intro I am trying to apply a custom view to all the results of a visit to a taxonomy page, which involves wrapping the whole lot of results in some DOM boilerplate and then invoking the function to display each result as an element within that boilerplate. My strategy of choice was to step through each result, populated dynamically depending which taxonomy term has led them here, and fill a bucket with those results, then display each one appropriately.
