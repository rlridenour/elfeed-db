<li>Plug them into any USB-A port and they make cool patterns</li>
<li>Take them anywhere</li>
<li>We won’t tell you what colors you’re getting (but they won’t all be the same)</li>
<li>No adjusting or programming or anything</li>
<li>Are they available in Georgia Red: Maybe? But, like, a trippy Dan Flashes style Georgia Red potentially?</li>
</ul><h1>Tiny Light Show</h1><p>So, what we’ve got here is a 5-pack of BlissLights Starport USB Laser Star Projectors. Basically, they’re the iPod Shuffle of the BlissLights family. You just plug them into a USB and let them rip. There’s no adjusting, no programming, nothing. They just project the cool pattern they project and that’s it.</p>
<p>So, like this:</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen class="youtube" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o9H9jy9vqV0?autohide=1&color=white&showinfo=0&theme=light"></iframe></p>
<p>Now, according to BlissLights, this is all for some good old-fashioned wholesome fun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t be fooled by StarPort’s size—it can light up a whole room with vibrant stars. Transform your room, set the vibe for a night of tabletop gaming, or take it on that family trip you’ve been planning and let the stars shine wherever you go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let’s be honest here; their entire suite of products would be pretty rad if you were high as hell, and these little guys are no exception. So, we’re going to go through a few Amazon reviews and rate them, not based on how thoughtful or articulate they are, but based solely on how stoned we think the user who wrote them was.</p>

<p><strong>Stoned rating</strong>: 0/10</p>
<p>Now, obviously, some of this depends on the daughter in question. Like, is she twelve? Or is she twenty-seven and living with a few friends in Portland? We’re going to assume the former, and anyway, the actual reviewer seems pretty sober.</p>

<p><strong>Stoned rating</strong>: 2/10</p>
<p>This is based solely on what we <em>think</em> is a typo in the review title. It’s supposed to be “and,” right? At any rate, not super stoned-sounding. Maybe just an occasional low THC or CBD-based sleep aide level of stoned.</p>

<p><strong>Stoned rating</strong>: 7/10</p>
<p>Okay, now we’re getting somewhere! I mean, come on: “people will ride along u looking at your stars.” (And, sidetone: this isn’t the only review mentioning how it can be used in a car. Which just makes me think how far we’ve come. Like, when I was a kid, I would be accused of attempted murder by my parents for turning on the overhead dome light to find something I dropped on the floor. Now we can drive around with laser projectors? Wow!)</p>

<p><strong>Stoned rating</strong>: 10/10</p>
<p>Look, we’re just thankful this person is in their parked car in the backseat, not behind the wheel driving eight miles per hour in the left lane of I-90 at 2am, just thinking about stuff, you know?</p>
<p>Has this helped you make an informed purchase? No, of course not.</p>
<p>But what can we say? These things are cool. Buy them!</p>
