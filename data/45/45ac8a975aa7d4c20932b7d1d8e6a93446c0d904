The store is located in The Hague, the capital city of South Holland.<br/>
<br/>
First opened in 2014, Apple Den Haag is one of the company's flagship stores, located in a covered walkway with historical architecture. The remodeled store will likely feature an Apple Pickup station for online orders, improved accessibility, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not indicated when the store will reopen, but remodeling often takes months.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has two other stores in the Netherlands, in Amsterdam and Haarlem.<br/>
