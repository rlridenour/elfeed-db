<p>Malaysia’s government has announced that children aged 15 and under will no longer be allowed to open or use social media accounts starting next year, as part of a new Online Safety Act coming into force on January 1 to address cyberbullying, online grooming and other harms to minors. Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said that from 2026 platforms operating in Malaysia will have to introduce electronic know-your-customer (eKYC) identity verification so users must prove their age, extending know-your-customer-style checks widely used in financial services to social media. Officials frame the move as a child-protection measure aligned with similar age-based rules soon taking effect in Australia and growing global concern over links between social media use and young people’s mental health. Critics and digital rights advocates in Malaysia have quickly raised questions about how authorities will enforce the ban, potential misuse of identity data and whether strict age limits truly tackle underlying problems such as screen addiction and unsafe online design.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/rKJD-CKiZKecS-AOgpg5MvVFo-2Br6VqFS2CEWVBZV2-Bvemm00FW-Qdw3H7YATT2oVfrNoayu1KRKcVLuScGv49dqslN7t6FbKKtUOI0lKSfv60kInUYYkGS4ufAmalAmSVqHQd57vHs57n_mx6z-IoXKOqJUQhShGFeQuXBytQPjxfG1h8uahGBo4F-cQCtUxPy4BVYuCSk-SCiDQzQtu-4YQse1XilONEABpuKcQ' alt='Social media platforms have been under intense scrutiny in Malaysia in recent months.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Online Safety Act: Malaysia’s Online Safety Act, which underpins the age-based ban, is scheduled to take effect on January 1 and will give regulators power to require platforms to add safety features and comply with new standards for protecting minors online.</li><li>EKYC rollout plan: Under the plan, social networks will have until 2026 to implement electronic know-your-customer checks such as matching identity documents or biometric data to user accounts so that ages can be verified before access is granted.</li><li>Existing cybercrime concerns: Malaysia has already tightened oversight of major platforms in recent years, pressuring them to remove scam-related content and cooperate with law enforcement as authorities report rising cybercrime and online fraud cases.</li><li>Parental responsibility: Officials have emphasized that, even with platform obligations, parents and guardians will remain responsible for monitoring children’s digital use and helping them adapt to life with more limited access to social media.</li><li>Global policy trend: Malaysia’s announcement comes just weeks before Australia’s national restriction on social media accounts for users under 16 takes effect, joining a wider international shift toward minimum ages, parental consent rules and time limits for children’s use of digital platforms.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Malaysian government: The government presents the age-based restriction and upcoming eKYC requirements as necessary steps to curb cyberbullying, grooming and exposure to harmful content among children and to make platforms more accountable for online safety features in the country.
