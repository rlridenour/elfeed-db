With the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/google-pixel-10-smartphones/">Pixel 10 smartphones</a>, <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/ai-photo-editing-google-photos/">Google announced</a> new AI functionality that's coming to its Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app and service.<br/>

Users will be able to describe the edits that they want to make with text or voice in the Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; editing interface, and the changes will appear. Google says there will be no need to select tools or adjust sliders, with complex edits enabled through conversational AI.<br/>
<br/>
Requests can be generic or specific, with Google suggesting the AI can understand even the most basic requests. Some of Google's examples:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Restore this old photo</li><br/>
 	<li>Remove the cars in the background</li><br/>
 	<li>Remove the reflections and fix the washed out colors</li><br/>
 	<li>Make it better</li><br/>
 	<li>Remove the glare, brighten the photo, and add clouds to the sky</li><br/>
 	<li>Add fun items like a party hat or sunglasses</li><br/>
 	<li>Change the background</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The AI supports multiple requests in a single prompt, along with follow-up requests.<br/>
<br/>
The new Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; functionality will be available on the Pixel 10 to start with, but it will presumably expand to other devices in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Google is also adding C2PA Content Credentials to Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, which will more clearly show how an image was captured or edited. C2PA Content Credentials will roll out to Google &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; on Android and iOS devices over the coming weeks.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-photos/">Google Photos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/google-photos-gets-conversational-editing/">Google Photos Gets Conversational Editing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-photos-gets-conversational-editing.2463729/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
