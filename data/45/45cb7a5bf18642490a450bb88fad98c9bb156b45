         <p>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you wish!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More
information in the announcement I posted:

<p>In this ~1-hour video, I talk to Thomas about using Emacs to write
blog posts and take notes. Then we switch gears to discuss Thomas’
involvement with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Part of that theme covers our
thoughts on sport culture, discipline and commitment. The last topic
is manga, which comes from Japan. We touch on the work ethic of manga
artists and, generally, the culture at play.</p>
