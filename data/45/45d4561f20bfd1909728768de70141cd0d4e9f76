<p id="p2">In the wake of last week&rsquo;s jaw-dropping Severance season two finale, Apple has released <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/lumon-terminal-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a behind-the-scenes video</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/how-the-mind-splitting-world-of-severance-comes-together-on-mac/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Newsroom story</a> showcasing the ways the Mac was used to edit the show. Both feature Severance&rsquo;s editors discussing the process &ndash; creative and technical &ndash; behind the show&rsquo;s editing. It&rsquo;s worth checking out both pieces because each offers interesting insights into how Severance is made.</p>
<p id="p3">The video shows on-set footage of director and executive producer Ben Stiller leading preparation for the season finale&rsquo;s marching band sequence. It then follows supervising editor Geoffrey Richman&rsquo;s process of combing through the 70 different camera angle options assembled into a single multicam clip on a Mac to find the right shot for each moment. The video also features insights from editor Keith Fraase and composer Theodore Shapiro about different aspects of the editing process throughout the season, which involved three editors, three assistant editors, and 83&nbsp;TB of footage.</p>
<p id="p4">In the Newsroom story, Geoffrey Richman dives deep into his editing workflow across various Macs. Richman uses a combination of an iMac at home, a MacBook Pro on the go, and a Mac Mini in a post-production studio to get his editing work done. He puts a lot of emphasis on the flexibility the Mac affords him:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  I can work on my laptop and I can work on my iMac, and I can work at the post facility or I can work at Ben&rsquo;s office, and as long as I&rsquo;m logged into my account, everything I do shows up everywhere&hellip; That aspect of Mac I find very handy &mdash; to not think about which system I&rsquo;m physically at.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">Richman points out other aspects of working on the Mac, like macOS&rsquo; built-in multitasking tools and the MacBook Pro&rsquo;s  HDMI port, that make the Mac the right tool for editing a TV show like Severance.</p>

The video, <em>Behind the Mac: Editing Severance</em>, is available to stream both <a href="https://youtu.be/TXNQ01Sy6Xw" rel="noopener noreferrer">on YouTube</a> and, in a fun twist, on Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/lumon-terminal-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer">fake product page</a> for the Lumon Terminal Pro. While our dreams of refining data on a real Terminal Pro have yet to be realized, you clearly can make great TV on a Mac.</p>
