</ul><h1>Powerful, Powderful</h1><p>Recently, I cited bags and pillows as the products that always cost way more than I expect. But today’s sale reminds me of a third category that absolutely destroys those two in terms of how shockingly pricey stuff can be. And that category is…</p>
<p>Every damn thing you need for your baby.</p>
<p>There are the big one-off items, of course, that you expect to be expensive. Your bassinet, your car seat, your stroller, et cetera. But even these things often reveal themselves to be even <em>more</em> expensive than expected.</p>
<p>And that’s before you even find the super high-end version with a bunch of bells and whistles you’d usually roll your eyes at. Only, in this case, it’s your child’s future we’re talking about. What if, in twenty-four years, your kid’s GRE scores are two points lower than they need to be to get into Harvard Law? And all because you didn’t buy the tiny bed with the soothing motions and the built-in white noise and the tracking app!</p>
<p>Beyond these things, though, there’s also the cumulative stuff.</p>
<p>Diapers and wipes, month after month. Clothing that your kiddo is going to grow out of after two wears.</p>
<p>And formula.</p>
<p>Like what we’re selling today, for example.</p>
<p>According to the Amazon reviews, it’s pretty good. Or, as user Jerry says: “Baby seem to like it.” Which is great!</p>
<p>What’s not so great is that this much would cost you about 60 bucks there. And how long will it last? Hard to say. Really depends on how your little one eats. But that’s part of the problem, right? L’il buddy’s healthy appetite should be something to celebrate, not a cause for financial anxiety.</p>
<p>And no, we can’t big picture solution for how expensive and difficult it is to raise a child in America.</p>
<p>But we can offer some formula for a nice price! And it won’t even expire until October!</p>
<p>Of course, if you have experience with this, share your thoughts in the comments.</p>
<p>Otherwise, buy some formula. For your baby. It’s good and it’s cheap.</p>
