<blockquote>
  <p>Google will officially deprecate links generated with its URL
shortening tool next month. On August 25th, 2025, all links in the
<code>https://goo.gl/*</code> format will no longer work and return a 404
error message.</p>

<p>Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/31/17184164/google-alphabet-url-shortening-service-closed">shut down its URL shortener in 2019</a>, citing “changes
we’ve seen in how people find content on the internet.” Links
created with the tool continued to work since then, but Google
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201734/google-url-link-shortening-service-shut-down-support">announced last year</a> that it would begin deprecating them as
traffic to the shortened URLs declined. “In fact more than 99% of
them had no activity in the last month,” Google said in its <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available/">July
2024 blog post</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The heyday for link shorteners was the era when Twitter (a) was still Twitter, (b) had a 140-character post limit, and (c) counted characters such that each character of a URL counted toward the 140-character limit. None of those things are true anymore. But, still. <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URLs don’t change</a>.</p>

<p>I’m sure it is true that 99 percent of goo.gl links had no activity in the past month. But I’m just as sure that it would cost next to nothing for Google to keep goo.gl up and running in perpetuity. I mean, 99 percent of <em>all</em> URLs probably had no activity in the last month. 99 percent of all books ever written weren’t read in the last month either, I bet — but that’s no excuse for libraries to throw them in the trash.</p>

<p>It’s fine that Google stopped allowing for the creating of new links a while back, but there’s no reason they should ever stop redirecting existing links. The whole reason anyone might have used goo.gl instead of something like <a href="https://bit.ly/">bit.ly</a> is misplaced trust in Google. I trust Google with almost nothing long-term. Mark my words, they’re going to do this with Gmail accounts eventually.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Google has come to its senses and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/03/google-reverses-course-on-googl">will keep these redirections working</a>.</p>
