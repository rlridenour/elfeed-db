In a new post, the Weibo user known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>" says that the foldable's battery could be over 5,500 mAh in size, which would make it the largest capacity of any current or previous &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> Max has the biggest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; battery to date at 5,088 mAh.<br/>
<br/>
Competing foldables already on the market feature a noticeably smaller battery than the rumored size. The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold has a battery capacity of 5,015 mAh, while the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has a 4,400 mAh battery. As a result, any foldable smartphone from Apple with a battery over 5,500 mAh in size would be class-leading. <br/>

Last year, the leaker known as "yeux1122" said that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/18/apple-foldable-biggest-iphone-battery/">testing a battery</a> for the device in the 5,400–5,800 mAh range, citing supply chain sources. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/foldable-iphone-impressive-battery-life-thinness/">March report</a> from the same Korean account claimed that Apple has placed a heavy focus on improving power efficiency while slimming down key components of its foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, with battery life said to be a key priority for the company. Separately, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said the device will use <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">high-density cells</a> to deliver superior battery life.<br/>

Apple's first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is rumored to feature a 7.8-inch crease-free inner display, a 5.5-inch cover display, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, two rear cameras, the A20 chip, and the "C2" modem. It is expected to launch alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max later this year. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/battery-life/">Battery Life</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/01/foldable-iphone-to-feature-unrivaled-battery-life/">Apple&#039;s Foldable iPhone Rumored to Feature Unrivaled Battery Life</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-foldable-iphone-rumored-to-feature-unrivaled-battery-life.2477008/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
