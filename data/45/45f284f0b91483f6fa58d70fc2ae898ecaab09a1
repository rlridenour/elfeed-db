<li>It looks like the Death Star</li>
<li>It makes waffles that look like the Death Star</li>
<li>Great potential gift</li>
<li>Can it make a Margarita: No, for that you’ll need the R2D2-shaped blender</li>
</ul><h1>A 3D Version That Makes A Flat Version</h1><p>A new friend has invited you to brunch at their home. Sounds great, right?</p>
<p>Only, when you arrive, you see they have a Death Star waffle maker.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Option 1</strong></p>
<p>Say, “That’s no moon! It’s a waffle maker.”</p>
<p><em>Analysis</em>: It’s a simple, predictable thing to say in such a case, and may earn you a guffaw or a polite laugh. All in all, a good way to acknowledge the quirkiness of the waffle maker while leaving the conversation open to further references without forcing the issue. But, be warned, if you are not the sole brunch attendee, and you did not arrive first, you may be making a joke that has already been made.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>
<p>Solemnly comment that, for those who suffer from extreme gluten allergies, a Death Star waffle maker might just, sadly, live up to its name.</p>
<p><em>Analysis</em>: Kind of a downer. Also, are you totally sure that’s how gluten allergies work? Not to mention the plethora of gluten-free flour options there are these days. Really, just a bad idea.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Option 3</strong></p>
<p>Propose ranking <em>Star Wars</em> spacecraft in terms of their potential for syrup retention if flattened and waffled. Maybe even expand the criteria to include the starships from other franchises for an even more fruitful discussion.</p>
<p><em>Analysis</em>: On the one hand, it’s a fun idea that inspires conversation, which can sometimes be difficult early on in a friendship. On the other hand, it assumes a level of fandom that you have not confirmed. After all, the Death Star is one of the most recognizable images from the entire franchise, known to casual and die-hard fans alike. Proposing such an activity as this may shame your host into admitting a surface-level knowledge of the cinematic universe. Conversely, you may humiliate yourself by offering up too much niche information all at once.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Option 4</strong></p>
<p>Ask if they also shop on Meh.</p>
<p><em>Analysis</em>: A high-risk-high-reward strategy. Maybe the answer will be yes, and you will find a deeper bond. But maybe they will say no and will then be embarrassed to learn they paid far more than they needed to for a novelty waffle maker. Or, even worse, they will find out that this novelty waffle maker, which they received as a gift and considered very thoughtful, was actually purchased at a steep discount from a dismissively named deal site.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Option 5</strong></p>
<p>Leave.</p>
<p><em>Analysis</em>: Honestly, never a bad idea. Who needs new friends, right?</p>
