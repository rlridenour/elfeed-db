<p>Here are some simple puzzles to exercise your brain.</p>

<p>1.  Write <code>partial-apply-left</code>, a function that takes a
  binary function and the left input of the binary function and
  returns the unary function that takes the right input and then applies
  the binary function to both inputs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
  ;; Define *foo* as a procedure that conses 'a onto its argument.
  &gt; (defvar *foo* (partial-apply-left #'cons 'a))

  &gt; (funcall *foo* 'b)
  (A . B)

  &gt; (funcall *foo* 42)
  (A . 42)</pre>

<p>2.  Write <code>distribute</code>, a function that takes a binary
  function, a left input, and a list of right inputs, and returns a
  list of the results of applying the binary function to the left
  input and each of the right inputs. (Hint:
  Use <code>partial-apply-left</code>)</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
  &gt; (distribute #'cons 'a '( (b c d) e 42))
  ((A B C D) (A . E) (A . 42))</pre>

<p>3.  Write <code>removals</code>, a function that takes a list
  and returns a list of lists, where each sublist is the original
  list with exactly one element removed.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
  &gt; (removals '(a b c))
  ((B C) (A C) (A B))</pre>
<p>Hint: </p>
<ul><li>One removal is the CDR of the list.</li>
<li>Other removals can be constructed by (distributed) consing the CAR onto
  the removals of the CDR.</li></ul>

<p>4. Write <code>power-set</code>, a function that takes a list and
  returns the power set of that list (the set of all subsets of the
  original list).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
  &gt; (power-set '(a b c))
  (() (C) (B) (B C) (A) (A C) (A B) (A B C))</pre>
<p>Hint: </p>
<p>Note how the power set of a list can be constructed from the power set of its
  CDR by adding the CAR to each subset in the power set of the
  CDR.</p>

<p>5. Write <code>power-set-gray</code> that returns the subsets
  sorted so each subset differs from the previous subset by a change
  of one element (i.e., each subset is equal to the next subset with
  either one element added or one element removed).  This is called a Gray
  code ordering of the subsets.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
  &gt; (power-set-gray '(a b c))
  (() (C) (B C) (B) (A B) (A B C) (A C) (A))</pre>
<p>Hint: </p>
<p>When appending the two halves of the power set, reverse the order
  of the second half.</p>
