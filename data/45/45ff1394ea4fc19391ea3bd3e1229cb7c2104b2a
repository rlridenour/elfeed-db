<p>In the 19th century, British polymath William Barnes tried to reform English by limiting it to words of Saxon-English origin. Where no &#8220;Teutonic&#8221; words were available to express his meaning, he made up alternatives, such as <em>sky-sill</em> for horizon, <em>glee-craft</em> for music, <em>wort-lore</em> for botany, <em>hearsomeness</em> for obedience, <em>somely</em> for plural, and <em>folkwain</em> for omnibus.</p>
<p>In 1948, Richard Lister <a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_new-statesman_1948-10-23_36_920/page/358/mode/2up">challenged the readers</a> of the <em>New Statesman</em> to write the opening paragraphs of a novel set in present-day London in this style of reformed English. Reader D.M. Low offered this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
As Ernest was wafted up on the dredger from the thorough-hole at Kingsway he was inwardly upborne to see Pearl again; but, alas, evenly castdown for the blue-eyed bebrilled booklearner was floating downwards on the other ladderway. It was now or never. Ernest fought back against the rising stairs and the gainbuildfulness of hirelings bound for work. Pushing aside fingerwriters, shophelpers and even deeded reckoning-keepers, by an overmanly try he reached the bottom eventimeously with Pearl.</p>
<p>&#8216;What luck! Can you eat with me tonight? I know a fair little upstaker near here.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Oh! I can&#8217;t. My Between-go is in Fogmonth, and I must get through and &#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p>The rumble of the ambercrafty wagonsnake drowned her words.</p>
<p>&#8216;Hark! There&#8217;s the tug. I must fly.&#8217;</p>
<p>It was hard to be wisdomlustful. Forlorn in his trystlessness Ernest sought Kingsway again and dodging hire-shiners and other self-shifters recklessly headed towards the worldheadtownly manystreakiness of the Strand.
