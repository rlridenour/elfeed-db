<p>In his later years Joseph Conrad became obsessed with the opening scene of an unwritten novel that he planned to set in an Eastern European state. &#8220;So vividly used he to describe this scene to me,&#8221; wrote his friend Richard Curle, &#8220;that at last it was as though I had been a witness to it myself&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the courtyard of a royal palace, brilliantly lighted up as for a festival, soldiers are bivouacked in the snow. And inside the palace a fateful council is taking place and the destiny of the country is being decided.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never learned anything more about this novel &#8212; I do not know how far Conrad had himself visualized the plot,&#8221; Curle wrote, &#8220;but as he pictured that opening scene one could almost feel the tension in the air and one almost seemed to be warming one&#8217;s hands with the soldiers around their blazing fire.&#8221;</p>
