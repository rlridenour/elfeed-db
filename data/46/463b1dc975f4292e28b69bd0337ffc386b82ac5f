Apple plans to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models equipped with the new M5 chip in spring 2026, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/apple-readies-high-end-macbook-pro-with-touch-hole-punch-screen">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. Apple is also working on M5 Pro and M5 Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models that will come early in the year.<br/>

Neither the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models nor the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models are expected to get design changes, with Apple focusing on simple chip upgrades. In the case of the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/macbook-pro-oled-touch-screen/">much bigger refresh</a> is planned for either late 2026 or early 2027.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is developing thinner, lighter OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models with touch screen capabilities. The late 2026/early 2027 refresh will mark the first design update to the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; since 2021.<br/>
<br/>
As for the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, it received a design update in 2022, though Apple did introduce a larger-screened 15-inch model in 2023. Rumors suggest the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; will get an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/macbook-air-advanced-lcd-panel-adoption-2027/">updated LCD display</a> in 2027, so design tweaks could come at that point.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is developing new versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, with those machines likely to get M5 Pro and/or M5 Max chips as well. There are also two external displays that are in the works, at least one of which is a second-generation version of the Studio Display. It's possible that new displays could come out alongside upgraded desktop machines, but there is no word on when Apple plans to update the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; and &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/m5-macbook-air-spring/">M5 MacBook Air Coming Spring 2026 With M5 Mac Studio and Mac Mini in Development</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m5-macbook-air-coming-spring-2026-with-m5-mac-studio-and-mac-mini-in-development.2469263/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
