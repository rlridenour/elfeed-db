<p>Financial Times reporter John Burn-Murdoch has a summary on Bluesky of his co-bylined <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6dc16a54-8de1-4f3b-8409-ecb566118127">report for the Financial Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visitors from western Europe who stayed at least one night in the
US fell by 17 per cent in March from a year ago, according to the
International Trade Administration. Travel from some countries — including Ireland, Norway and Germany — fell by more than 20 per
cent, an FT analysis of ITA data showed.</p>

<p>The trend poses a threat to the US tourism industry, which
accounts for 2.5 per cent of the country’s GDP. Some airlines and
hotel groups have warned of waning demand for transatlantic travel
and a “bad buzz” about visiting the US. The total number of
overseas visitors travelling to the US dropped by 12 per cent
year-on-year in March, the steepest decline since March 2021 when
the travel sector was reeling from pandemic restrictions,
according to the ITA data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I’m sure it will turn around when the April figures come out, after Trump’s tariff madness and the news that Secretary of State Marco Rubio — supposedly one of the few sane voices in the 2.0 Trump kakistocracy — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/mahmoud-khalil-memo-marco-rubio-deport-beliefs">has signed a two-page argument that noncitizens can be deported for their beliefs</a>, a.k.a. thought crimes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In just two months [Trump] has destroyed the reputation of the
US, shown one way by diminished travel from the EU to the US,”
said Paul English, co-founder of travel website Kayak. “This is
not only one more terrible blow to the US economy, it also
represents reputation damage that could take generations to
repair.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need more clearheaded statements like this from business leaders. Just state the truth plainly. The only side English took with this statement is the side of the truth.</p>
