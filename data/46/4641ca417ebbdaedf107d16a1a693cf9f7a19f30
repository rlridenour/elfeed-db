<p>President Donald Trump said he may block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge—a new crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan—unless Canada &quot;fully compensate&quot; the United States and agrees to US ownership of “at least one half” of the asset. The bridge is expected to open in early 2026, and multiple reports describe it as a key future trade link between the two neighbors. Trump cast the threat as part of a broader dispute over what he called unfair Canadian treatment of the US. He pointed to issues including dairy tariffs and provincial limits on US alcohol sales, and he criticized Canada’s outreach to China. Several outlets also place the bridge comments within wider US-Canada trade tensions in Trump’s second term, including tariff threats and political pushback in Washington. Even with the political friction, the project itself reflects years of cross-border cooperation and is meant to add capacity on a major corridor—something businesses, commuters, and travelers on both sides could benefit from once it opens.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/veA1tszvBOXcQ_1JNBkth11OtZpQG_Dbyx0MddgWon0yfbvYttuTlXoZmvBP-Ge_IocRPlCMalB58sLo3i88UXyPWDqPNep3IrJbIAbVqz4Ev_gNzENKEKZknLzUuxiWf6frwl6B0fzElMo_TOaRNSOxZSlJISaL_0hyGsML8jDR2OnngoBAjZc_WItxQLwgUAmreU3BgEk-dwN2cd6Lh4AWphUADFKQefXc9APSHjAnBGRmr_E8N39REq4QuMo6GGk' alt='The Gordie Howe International Bridge, linking Detroit and Windsor, in a Reuters photo carried by The Hindu.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who funded it: The Canadian government fully paid for the bridge, according to coverage that contrasts Ottawa’s role with Trump’s demand for compensation and partial US ownership.</li><li>Cost figures: One outlet puts the project cost at $4.6bn, underscoring that estimates vary across reports.</li><li>Domestic politics: In the US House, Democrats plan to force a vote this week tied to Trump’s tariffs on Canada, as his bridge comments add to the broader trade fight.</li><li>Build-content/Buy American claim: Trump said the bridge was built with “virtually no US content” and argued an Obama-era waiver let Canada bypass ‘Buy American’ requirements.
