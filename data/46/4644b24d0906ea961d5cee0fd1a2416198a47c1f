<p>Emacs <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">swiper</a> is awesome. I bound <em>swiper-isearch</em> to <em>C-s</em>. Also a big fan of <a href="https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el">multiple cursors</a>. I use it regularly (it's fun).</p>
<p>I had totally missed Ole's post back in 2015: <a href="https://oremacs.com/2015/10/14/swiper-mc/">A simple multiple-cursors extension to swiper</a>. Turns out, swiper has multiple cursors support out of the box (bound to <em>C-7</em> by default). Yay!</p>
<p>UPDATE: Thanks to <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8370">irreal's post</a>, please remember to add <em>swiper-mc</em> to <em>mc/cmds-to-run-once</em> list (or things won't work as expected). This typically happens interactively when you invoke C-7 the first time around. Make sure you answer &quot;n&quot; when you see a prompt like:</p>

<p>If you happen to choose &quot;y&quot; by mistake, take a look at <strong>~/.emacs.d/.mc-lists.el</strong> to correct it. Remove <em>swiper-mc</em> from <em>mc/cmds-to-run-for-all</em> and add it to <em>mc/cmds-to-run-once</em>. Invoke <em>m-x eval-buffer</em> to reset the values and you're good to go.</p>
