<p>President Trump said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him India would stop buying Russian oil, presenting it as a step to curb Moscow’s energy revenues [france24.com#1][bbc.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#1]. New Delhi did not confirm the pledge, emphasizing instead that its oil imports are driven by the need to protect Indian consumers and ensure stable prices and supplies in a volatile market [reuters.com#1][firstpost.com#1][ndtv.com#2][dawn.com#1]. Industry sources told Reuters that some Indian refiners are preparing to gradually cut purchases of Russian crude, indicating any change would likely be phased rather than abrupt [reuters.com#1]. The United States recently raised tariffs on Indian exports and has linked potential relief to curbing Russian oil buying, against the backdrop of India’s expanded intake of discounted Russian crude since Western sanctions reshaped oil trade after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine [reuters.com#1][washingtonpost.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/aMR4UdyHU4KyIuB3aweF80RnDRZwJFVeIi9OE8SSveradHS3oR2lDyAQgxhx9pHjSY7HY5KP9rQr60dnw_B1SJmUTIreNo7zNFS9yeI9A2Kl-2wDmJogUYeYKXYLPJUo0unUHmm3Lq-xkcHT6POioAVEsgzeDfzcbx0qYBa41TkW4Nz_W39zLy7flL2U73p0ytQqHtjiSjbbbnMSD8fMAeX1lJOE24kH1IwfTwJodMsdlvVGZrhyR1o61x0MIlRLJc08CfSM1pLUEUhk7A' alt='President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Trade leverage: U.S. negotiators say reducing Russian oil purchases is crucial to lowering India’s tariff rate and sealing a broader trade deal [reuters.com#1].</li><li>Talks in Washington: Indian officials are in Washington for trade discussions as tariff and energy issues are negotiated in parallel [reuters.com#1].</li><li>Russia response: Moscow called Russian oil important for India’s economy and signaled continued energy dialogue, while expecting further Indian purchases [ndtv.com#1][rferl.org#1].</li><li>China angle: President Trump added he wants China to stop buying Russian oil as well [rt.com#1][bbc.com#1].</li><li>Supply diversification: India historically relied on Middle East crude but shifted toward discounted Russian barrels since 2022, reflecting its diversification strategy [dawn.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario.
