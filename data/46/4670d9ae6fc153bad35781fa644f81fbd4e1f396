In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UgXZjY9eQI">new ad</a>, Google says iOS 26 copies three Android features that have been available on Pixel phones for years: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-live-translation-messages-facetime-phone/">Live Translate</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/phone-app-macos-tahoe/">Hold Assist</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/phone-app-macos-tahoe/">Call Screening</a>.<br/>

The video, part of the ongoing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/google-mocks-iphone-17-design/">#BestPhonesForever series</a>, shows an iPhone and a Pixel 9 Pro talking to each other on a fictional podcast. <br/>
<br/>
"I announced live translation for text messages," the iPhone says.<br/>
<br/>
"And it turned out I had that four years ago," the Pixel 9 Pro responds.<br/>
<br/>
"Yeah, crazy coincidence," the iPhone says.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the iPhone brings up Hold Assist and Call Screening, and the Pixel phone says it already offered those features too.<br/>

Live Translate debuted on the Pixel 6 in 2021. Just like on iOS 26, the feature can auto-translate text messages and phone calls.<br/>
<br/>
In 2020, Google introduced a Hold for Me feature for the Pixel 3 and newer. Just like Hold Assist on iOS 26, the feature can wait on hold for you during a phone call so you do not need to pay attention, and alert you when the agent comes on the line.<br/>
<br/>
Call screening debuted on the Pixel 3 all the way back in 2018.<br/>
<br/>
Google does have a point here, but whether the ad is humorous or cringy is up for debate.<br/>
