<p>If you feel like macOS Tahoe has all your app icons look a bit lackluster (at best), you’re not alone. Rogue Amoeba CEO/Lackey Paul Kafasis <a href="https://onefoottsunami.com/2025/11/05/tahoes-terrible-icons/">runs down many of the changes</a>, for better and for ill. Mostly for ill.</p>
<p>My personal favorite is the new Calendar icon which, as Paul points out, has a mathematical oddity in the number of dots it shows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I remember that 30 days hath November, April, June, and September. And I thought all the rest had 31, except February, which has 28, except in a leap year when it has 29. Which month is it that has 24 days?

<p>The look and feel of the Mac has always been—if you’ll pardon the pun—iconic. App icons were a place that developers could show off their creativity, and make apps that are instantly identifiable. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/09/macos-26-tahoe-review-power-under-glass/">Squircle jail</a> remains a thing in macOS 26.1 (and, I’d argue, is worse than before, with a new lighter gray background that feels even more jarring). Here’s hoping this trend gets reversed before too long.</p>
