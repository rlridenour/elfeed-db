<p>Trust me on this one: it’s wise to keep the basics for 3 days away from home always packed in a suitcase or backpack. Do that and you’ll always be prepared for unexpected trips away, or evacuation in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>It’s too late when the time comes, so do it now. Clothing, medication, snacks, toilet paper, anything you wouldn’t want to be without in the short term if you couldn’t make it to a shop. Review the contents every 6 months and replace anything that has an expiry date. Test your choices by heading out for the weekend taking nothing but the pack in your trunk, and seeing how you get along!</p>
