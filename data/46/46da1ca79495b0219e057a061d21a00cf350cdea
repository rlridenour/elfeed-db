</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Exhuming a reflection I wrote in October around “leaving a record.”
</p>
        <p class="verse">
We cross the line, who pushed who over?<br />
It doesn’t matter to you, it matters to me<br />
We’re cut adrift, but still floating<br />
I’m only hanging on to watch you go down, my love.<br />

<p>In <a href="https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/printed-is-not-the-point">Printed is not the Point</a>, I encountered the following quote:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

What record are we leaving if the printed word is not the most interesting
creative work being developed?

<footer>&mdash;

</blockquote>

<p>I question that the “printed word“ has ever been much of “the most interesting
creative work being developed.”  Consider the interesting and ephemeral [saucy]
puppet show, street protest, poetic recitation, dance routine, or concert.
Though perhaps “work” is carrying the burden?  As in the toil expressed?  Or the
concept enclosed?</p>
<p>But then again, the word “interesting” is one of those “eye of the beholder”
words.  The printed word’s super power is one of slow moving transport: across
time and space.  Ideas bound and encoded for transport—of atomic symbols
creating molecules with which we create a transport of cultural DNA.</p>
<p>I read the lamenting question as one of the shift from analog to digital; in
which digital preservation requires far more resources of active attention than
analog—which itself requires more space than digital.  As though there is some
universal constant that expresses the cost of sustaining memory: in physical
space, archival processes and systems, and/or calories to maintain biological
brains—though can a book or hard-drive be called “memory?”</p>
<p>And then to turn to “What record are we leaving,” implying a collective and
coordinated effort.  To join in the grandeur of cultural preservation and
heritage; to belong to a line—constructed/fabricated—connecting from antiquity
to the days ahead.  We carry that ever accumulating baggage, as though an honor,
and one we hope to add a little and bestow upon successive generations.  Do we
demand accretion? or is composting adequate?</p>
<p>One record we will leave is the death rattle of capitalism<small class="side-container">

 and its
escalating ravages against the world.  Perhaps those ravages shall transform and
pass into myth, a Scylla and Charybdis of parched earth, nuclear waste, acidic
oceans, and eroded wastelands.  How might one notice any other record?</p>
