<p>Veteran developer Brent Simmons is retiring, but on his way out the door he wrote <a href="https://inessential.com/2025/05/23/love_letter.html">a really great blog post</a> about his assumptions about corporate app development (he spent the last five years working on Audible’s iOS app) and the teams who build those apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  With retirement imminent — this is my last job, and June 6 is my last day (maybe I’ve buried the lede here) — I want to thank my team publicly for how they’ve made me a better engineer and, more importantly, a better person. From the bottom of my heart.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Good news: Brent says <a href="https://inessential.com/2025/05/24/retirement_and_netnewswire.html">he’ll have more time to devote</a> to NetNewsWire, his open-source RSS reading app, as well as other open-source, not-for-profit programming projects.</p>
<p>A hearty “job well done” and best wishes for a great retirement to Brent.</p>
