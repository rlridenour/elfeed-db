<p>My thanks to Meh for sponsoring last week at DF. Meh puts up a new deal every day, and they do it with panache. As they say, “It’s actual, real, weird shit you didn’t know existed for half the price you would’ve guessed.”</p>

<p>Don’t tell any of my other sponsors, but <a href="https://meh.com/go/df">Meh</a> is my favorite <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive">longtime DF sponsor</a>. I love the way their orange graphics look against DF’s <code>#4a525a</code> background. And I always love their sponsored posts that go into the RSS feed at the start of the sponsorship week. I’ll just quote theirs from this week in full:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything sucks. The whole world’s going to shit, especially our
part of it, and it can feel like anything fun or silly is sticking
your head in the sand.</p>

<p>And yet. It doesn’t help to just be miserable. If you’re going to
last, you’ve got to find your little moments of joy, or as a break
from the misery.</p>

<p>Buying our crap at Meh is not how you solve the world’s problems.
We’re not that crass. But maybe a minute a day of reading our
little write-up, and a couple minutes of catching up with the Meh
community, of making a few new online friends, and yes, of
occasionally picking up a weird gadget or strange snack you’ve
never heard of is just a few minutes you get to take a break, not
giving in to how bad everything else is.</p>

<p>Of course we would say that. Of course we benefit from that.
But it is also part of why we have a quirky write-up. Why we
have a community. Why we’re selling whatever weird thing is
over at Meh today.</p>
