<p>Israel’s security cabinet approved administrative and legal changes that make it easier for Jewish settlers to acquire land in the occupied West Bank, and expand Israeli authorities’ ability to act in areas meant to be under Palestinian Authority control. Israeli ministers cast the steps as a way to strengthen settlement activity. The move has drawn diplomatic pushback. The United Kingdom has urged Israel to reverse it, and the United States, France, Switzerland, and the UN secretary-general have also objected. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the measures further erode the prospects for a two-state solution, while Palestinians and regional bodies urged “powerful partners” to act to stop what they describe as annexation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/6Jq4bElmIfxfAK7BfyJoYRqSgSBuO-LiUR-Hv4lxigMT8MtxOnEBRbQ_iAec-EPAklbcGL297VjjUpuKqqz0d9XoiE2NGq1A8ILY-35H' alt='HEBRON: Armed Israeli settlers walk near the settlement of Abraham Avino in this Israeli-occupied West Bank city.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Permit removed: Israeli ministers said the cabinet ended a requirement for prospective buyers to get a special permit from the civil administration before purchasing West Bank land—something critics say lowers the barriers to settlement growth.</li><li>Registry changes: Le Monde described the package as “technical measures” meant to streamline land acquisition, including changes affecting access to land registries and related administrative procedures.</li><li>Oslo concerns: France said the measures run counter to the Oslo Accords and the Hebron Protocol—agreements that set out civil and security responsibilities in parts of the West Bank.</li><li>Demolitions reported: Dawn reported that as international criticism grew, Israel began demolishing Palestinian structures near Jenin, and the Arab League was set to convene to discuss the situation.</li><li>Action doubts: In Al Jazeera commentary, analyst Fathi Nimer said he does not expect countries that oppose annexation to take action to stop it.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration (United States): A Trump administration official said the president does not support Israel annexing the West Bank, and argued that a stable West Bank fits the administration’s goal of pursuing peace while keeping Israel secure.
