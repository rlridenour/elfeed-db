Earlier this week, a leaker known as Majin Bu revealed that you <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/iphone-17-liquid-silicone-cases-rumor/">might be able to attach a lanyard</a> to Apple's official iPhone 17 cases.<br/>
<br/>

It turns out that Majin Bu was not the only source to make such a claim this week, as another leaker known as DuanRui also shared a CAD of an alleged iPhone 17 Pro case with two spots to attach a lanyard, in the bottom corners.<br/>
<br/>
DuanRui's post was spotted <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/06/phone-17-case-lineup-could-take-design-cue-from-airpods-pro/">by <em>9to5Mac</em>'s Zac Hall</a>.<br/>

There is precedent for such a thing, as AirPods Pro 2 charging cases have a cutout for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/incase-lanyard-airpods-pro-2/">attaching a lanyard</a>. Apple does not offer its own AirPods Pro 2 lanyard, but it has offered various third-party options through its online store.<br/>
<br/>
The same would likely apply for iPhone 17 lanyards: third-party and sold separately.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the fifth-generation iPod touch had a built-in mechanism for attaching a lanyard too, without even needing a case.<br/>

"DuanRui" often relays content that originates on Chinese social media platform Weibo.
