Content Periodically emacs crashes; I spent a long time debugging, which was really difficult because it was only reproducible by crashing my system. It turns out to be because of garbage collection. Other theory is that it is somehow due to Firefox.
Previously tried, ruled out  EXWM. No, it crashed with Gnome, too Popups (esp in browser). Too many Firefox windows Too much text on the screen at once. But it has crashed in one-screen setups, too Stack overflow from programs that are doing logging manually.
