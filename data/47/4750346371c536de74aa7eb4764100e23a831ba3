The joke about Emacs being an operating system is an old one but lately the idea seems to be being taken more seriously. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1l8llc5/emacs_os/">the latest example</a>. Significantly, the poster, Bi-Jean, is a self-confessed n00b who doesn&rsquo;t work in the tech industry, just someone who likes playing with computers and is curious about the best ways of using them. The idea seems natural to Bi-Jean.

If you believe, as I do, that the best way of thinking of Emacs is as a latter-day Lisp Machine, the idea of it being an OS makes more sense. Specialized applications aside, there&rsquo;s basically no function that you can&rsquo;t implement from within Emacs except arguably a decent Web browser. From that perspective, the &ldquo;real&rdquo; OS is viewed as a set of device drivers for Emacs. It&rsquo;s a point of view adopted by many Emacsers who claim not to care what OS it&rsquo;s running on.

My own view, as someone who does almost everything from within Emacs, is that &ldquo;My operating system is Emacs and Linux/macOS/Windows is just a set of device drivers&rdquo; is a nice joke that captures an underlying truth but isn&rsquo;t truly realistic. I always say that I do <i>virtually</i>  everything in Emacs and Safari but the &ldquo;virtually&rdquo; provides a little wiggle room. For example, I use <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a> to sync my calendar across all my devices, the Reminders app to set a reminder across all my devices, and the Apple Messages app for texting—although I do use Emacs to compose the text—so it&rsquo;s not really Emacs all the way down.<br />
Still, a case can be made that in an essential way, Emacs really is my OS. Perhaps more important is the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. I do most of my work—other than browsing—from within Emacs and if that makes Emacs my operating system, fine but I also depend on macOS for more than just running Emacs.</p>
