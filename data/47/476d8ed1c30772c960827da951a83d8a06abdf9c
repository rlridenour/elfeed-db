Apple's foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> could be priced at &#36;2,399, according to an estimate shared by analyst <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fubon-expects-the-first-foldable-iphone-to-cost-2399-4375098">Arthur Liao at Fubon Research</a>. There have been a range of price estimates, from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/foldable-iphone-thickness-and-price-rumors/">as low as &#36;1,800</a> to as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">high as &#36;2,500</a>, and the latest estimate falls on the higher side.<br/>

Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> previously said he expects the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold to cost between &#36;2,000 and &#36;2,500, and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> expects it to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/">somewhere around &#36;2,000</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will be expensive because of the premium components that Apple plans to use. The display panel and hinge will push pricing toward the upper end of market expectations, Fubon Research suggests.<br/>
<br/>
Demand for the device will depend on the price that Apple sets, but Fubon believes that Apple could sell around 5.4 million units in 2026. Global smartphone demand could fall during the year, and foldables will be the "only spotlight" in the 2026 smartphone market.<br/>

The report says that Apple is also working on camera upgrades for 2026, with the first variable aperture lens planned for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro models. It doesn't sound like the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Fold will get the variable aperture lens that Apple is developing, but rumors indicate it will have a dual-lens rear camera setup with Wide and Ultra Wide lenses along with two front cameras.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/24/foldable-iphone-could-cost-2400/">Foldable iPhone Could Cost &#36;2,400</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-could-cost-2-400.2471840/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
