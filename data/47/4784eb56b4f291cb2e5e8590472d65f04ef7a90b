<blockquote>
  <p>However, despite Elon Musk promising that Grokipedia would be a
“massive improvement” over Wikipedia, some articles appear to be
cribbing information <em>from</em> Wikipedia. At the bottom of the page
for the <a href="https://grokipedia.com/page/MacBook_Air">MacBook Air</a>, for example, you can see this
message: “The content is adapted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge">Wikipedia</a>,
licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
License.” In some cases, the cribbing goes farther than a rewrite:
I’ve also seen that message on pages for the <a href="https://grokipedia.com/page/PlayStation_5">PlayStation
5</a> and the <a href="https://grokipedia.com/page/Lincoln_Mark_VIII">Lincoln Mark VIII</a>, and both of
those pages are almost identical — word-for-word, line-for-line — to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5">Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Mark_VIII">counterparts</a>.</p>

<p>“Even Grokipedia needs Wikipedia to exist,” Lauren Dickinson, a
spokesperson for the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit that
operates Wikipedia tells The Verge. You can read Dickinson’s
full statement in full at the end of this article.</p>

<p>At launch, Grokipedia is to Wikipedia as a chewed piece of gum is to a fresh piece of gum still in its wrapper. And imagine that the gum was chewed by someone with a dipping tobacco habit.</p>
