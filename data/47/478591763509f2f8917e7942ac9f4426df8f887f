While most sources in the Apple rumor scene agree that the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max will feature under-screen Face ID, there continues to be conflicting rumors about how that change might impact the Dynamic Island.<br/>
<br/>

In a post on social media platform X today, the account <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/2013228811975053466">"ShrimpApplePro" claimed</a> that the Dynamic Island will be "shorter" on the iPhone 18 Pro models, as a result of some Face ID components moving under the screen. Only the front camera and Face ID's infrared camera will remain visible on the devices, they said.<br/>
<br/>
"ShrimpApplePro" has accurately leaked some details about devices like the iPhone 15 Pro and Apple Watch Series 9 in the past, but they are not always correct. Early rumors should always be treated with some skepticism.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, <em>The Information</em> said that the front camera would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/iphone-18-pro-features-report/">moved to the top-left corner of the screen</a> on the iPhone 18 Pro models. The report explicitly said this change would help to eliminate the pill-shaped cutout in the screen, but "ShrimpApplePro" evidently believes that the Dynamic Island will live on in a smaller way.<br/>
<br/>
YouTube channel Front Page Tech mocked up an iPhone 18 Pro with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/19/iphone-18-pro-dynamic-island-top-left-corner/">both the front camera and a smaller Dynamic Island in the top-left corner of the screen</a>, but the video might simply be combining the two rumors mentioned above.<br/>
<br/>
While the exact implementation remains to be seen, the good news is that it really does sound like under-screen Face ID is finally happening this year.<br/>
<br/>
South Korean publication <a href="https://www.etnews.com/20260119000301"><em>ETNews</em> today reported</a> (via "<a href="https://x.com/jukan05/status/2013151757044457511">Jukan</a>") that the iPhone 18 Pro models will use under-screen infrared technology from Samsung, which would pave the way for under-screen Face ID. The report also said the devices will use so-called LTPO+ display technology, which would likely be more power efficient than the current LTPO technology in the iPhone 17 series. This upgrade should contribute to longer battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 18 Pro models in September, and hopefully the Face ID and Dynamic Island rumors are more clear by then.<br/>
