<p><em>To read my newspapers I load my RSS feed via the <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">elfeed package</a></em>.<br>
&hellip;<br>
<em>Also, I identify any RSS feed entry that does not provide the full
text. And those live in provisional status. My reflexes are to ask
“there’s lots of full-text feeds, why bother with this truncation?”</em></p>

<p>Jeremy is totally right! &ndash; it came to my mind immediately.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> static site generator to
build this blog. Hugo uses <em>content summaries</em> to display a list of
blog entries on the main page. As a result, the Elfeed entry shows a
summary of the post instead of the full text.</p>
<p>Many of us &ndash; including me &ndash; are using <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">Elfeed</a>
as an RSS reader, and I have realized that the truncated Elfeed entry may cause inconvenience
to the Elfeed users.</p>
<p>Applying some tricks I was able to disable the automatic displaying of
summaries on the main page. I hope it has become more comfortable for
those who use Elfeed for reading RSS feeds.</p>
<p>Happy elfeeding!</p>
