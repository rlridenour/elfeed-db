<blockquote>
  <p>GM plans to drop support for phone projection on all new vehicles
in the near future, and not just its electric car lineup,
according to GM CEO Mary Barra.</p>

<p>In a Decoder <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/803379/gm-ceo-mary-barra-sterling-anderson-cadillac-iq-ev-autonomy-interview">interview with The Verge’s Nilay Patel</a>, published
Wednesday, Barra confirmed GM will eventually end support of Apple
CarPlay and Android Auto on both gas-powered and electric cars.
The timing is unclear, but Barra pointed to a major rollout of
what the company is calling a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/802452/gm-forward-ai-robot-level-3-autonomous">new centralized computing platform</a>,
set to launch in 2028, that will involve eventually transitioning
its entire lineup to a unified in-car experience.</p>

<p>Someone should investigate whether Mary Barra is a mole planted at GM by Ford. (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/05/ford-ceo-jim-farley-carplay">Previously</a>.)</p>
