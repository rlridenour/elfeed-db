Apple is actively testing under-screen Face ID for next year's iPhone 18 Pro models using a special "spliced micro-transparent glass" window built into the display, claims a Chinese leaker. <br/>

According to "<a href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/QhaTOnSUl">Smart Pikachu,</a>" a Weibo account that has previously shared accurate supply-chain details on Chinese Android hardware, Apple is testing the special glass as a way to let the TrueDepth system's infrared sensors pass through the panel without distortion. <br/>
<br/>
The approach is similar to existing industry techniques that use micro-perforated or nano-patterned glass to selectively improve IR transmission in a localized region above the sensor array.<br/>
<br/>
The report also suggests Apple's work has already prompted related suppliers to accelerate preparation for potential production. <br/>
<br/>
There have been several rumors suggesting the iPhone 18 Pro models will include under-display Face ID, but some disagreement over whether we'll see the technology in 2026. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/">May report</a> by <em>The Information</em> claimed that iPhone 18 Pro models will have no Dynamic Island with just a pinhole cutout located at the upper left of the display, but other rumors suggest there's still going to be a Dynamic Island.<br/>
<br/>
Analyst Ross Young said that the iPhone 18 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/iphone-18-pro-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/">could have under-display Face ID</a>, but that doesn't mean there won't be no Dynamic Island at all. Instead, the pill-shaped hole will be smaller. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has also spoken of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/22/iphone-all-screen-design-two-stages/">slimmed down Dynamic Island</a> for the iPhone 18 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
The new claim of a micro-transparent glass window supports the view that there will be a smaller Dynamic Island that shifts TrueDepth sensing components below the screen while retaining a smaller cutout for the front camera. While Smart Pikachu does not specifically mention the Pro models, supply-chain sources often use "series" loosely when discussing early panel and materials testing, and all previous rumors have related to Apple's high-end models.<br/>

Apple is expected to release the iPhone 18 Pro models in September, alongside an all-new foldable iPhone, as part of a new split cycle launch. The regular iPhone 18 and the more affordable iPhone 18e are not expected to debut until early 2027.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-pikachu/">Smart Pikachu</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/iphone-18-pro-under-display-face-id/">iPhone 18 Pro Leak Adds New Evidence for Under-Display Face ID</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pro-leak-adds-new-evidence-for-under-display-face-id.2474361/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
