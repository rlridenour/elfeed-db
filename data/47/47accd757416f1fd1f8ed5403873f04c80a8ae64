Intro This wasn&rsquo;t always the case, but I find that now emacs is ignoring some files when I do find-file. The most annoying example is .git not appearing, although I can navigate through it if I type it fully. This seems to happen whether I am using my vertico for find-file, or if I disable vertico and try using tab-completion in a raw find-files. How can I find out what is being ignored, and change/disable it?
