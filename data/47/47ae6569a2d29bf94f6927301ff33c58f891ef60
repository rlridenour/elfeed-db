<p>Content, containers, files, and apps. Don’t unnecessarily limit or complicate the choices your future self can make. Metadata changes that are making my text-based flashcards more useful.</p>

<p>In Jorge Arango’s <a href="https://jarango.com/2024/10/22/the-informed-life-with-karen-mcgrane/" target="_blank">podcast 151</a>, Karen McGrane says that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking of the content that you produce as being distinct from the container in which it will live is a fundamental principle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(She’s leading in to talking about generative <span class="small-caps">AI</span>. It’s good to see conversations on the topic that acknowledge the potential it has to cause harm as well as to do good.)</p>
<p>This is the underlying principle behind the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/096-content-files-observation">files first, apps second</a><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> philosophy, and the foundation of Rule One: <em>Keep your data portable</em>.</p>
<p>I often see people holding back from making notes because they don’t know which app to use. They all seem to be wooing us, don’t they! But this isn’t about monogamy or relationships. It’s about using tools to view and work with your content, your creations. Shackling those to a specific app will unnecessarily limit or complicate the choices your future self can make.</p>

<p>I’m still enjoying using flashcards in Obsidian. The way I structure each card has changed a little since <a href="2023-09-04 PTPL 068 - Markdown Flashcards That Don't Need Apps or Plugins" title="wikilink">writing about it</a> in September last year. This is what my cards looked like then:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/0de87767-f33c-4d0b-ad3d-74f35463ccb8.png" alt="White Mac window with grey top bar. There’s a list of files on the left, and the Properties pane on the right. In the middle is a preview of a Markdown flashcard. Under the sentences is a transcluded audio file, with a pop-up showing Playback Speed." width="2364" height="1512"> And this is what their metadata looks like now:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/9e994c13-17fe-4bb9-a655-a3c171ff53dd.jpg" alt="Black monotype text on a white background showing metadata of a French / English flashcard" width="2504" height="2378"> <em>The same flashcard in source mode, showing changed metadata</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The changes are subtle but significant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each flashcard begins with the date it was last reviewed. This makes it easy to review cards that haven’t been done for a while.</li>
<li>I can see how much time has elapsed between reviews</li>
<li>There’s a code in the file name to identify it as a flashcard (F), that the topic is French (84), the language partner who will be checking it (40), and whether it’s unchecked (0), or I found it hard (1), good (2), or easy (3). This kind of metadata could be in the <span class="small-caps">YAML</span> of each card, but I like the simplicity of sorting and searching by file names. Saved searches work in many apps, so I’m not tied to Obsidian to use these cards.</li>
<li>Creation date is for my reference. I’ve learned not to rely on the inbuilt creation date of a file; there are some circumstances that can cause that to change/reset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages of fully manual flashcards:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no pressure to get through a certain number of cards each day</li>
<li>Manually entering today’s date lets me repeat the text of the flashcard a few more times (out loud or in my head). This is the kind of multi-tasking I really like!</li>
</ul>
