<p>Severe monsoon rains, amplified by multiple tropical cyclones, have triggered catastrophic floods and landslides across Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and parts of Vietnam and Malaysia, killing more than 1,200 people in recent days and leaving hundreds still missing. Authorities report that Indonesia has suffered the highest confirmed losses, with well over six hundred deaths, while Sri Lanka and Thailand have also recorded hundreds of fatalities and extensive damage to homes and infrastructure. Millions of people have been driven from their homes or cut off by high water, prompting large-scale rescue operations involving national militaries, emergency crews and local volunteers rushing boats, helicopters and trucks to reach isolated communities. Officials and scientists link the severity of the flooding to a combination of intense seasonal rains, cyclone activity and growing exposure of communities living in low‑lying or landslide‑prone areas, and they say the priority now is to protect survivors, restore essential supplies and plan safer rebuilding.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/T-e9eb73lplguU-GyU6Hq6DKOBL3B2V9wrA7Y5k2-I88MZRhBHpLTL02cheONVlogTBpT7gy3_aGdU_-NZVD1KWegSVS59Wzut9_aaC_9_3ziXWJ1t-PXoOd9dZqVwkaJuKPrEadNdsw0YdZ_J0n_3qE527pzcUnOejJFfexHJMeDWgBe_eZK2nK17cs5yed818BmUnO5xcrS_X3' alt='Homes and fields inundated after a flash flood in Batang Toru, North Sumatra, Indonesia.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Country breakdown: Regional tallies indicate at least 659 deaths in Indonesia, 390 in Sri Lanka and 181 in Thailand from flooding and landslips, highlighting how widely the disaster is spread across South and Southeast Asia.</li><li>Missing and injured: In Indonesia alone, authorities say around 500 people remain unaccounted for and thousands have been injured after rivers burst their banks and villages were engulfed.</li><li>Cyclone influence: Meteorologists link Indonesia’s heaviest downpours to the interaction of at least two tropical cyclones that fed moisture into the region and intensified rainfall far beyond normal monsoon patterns.</li><li>Relief logistics: Governments and aid groups are using military aircraft, navy vessels and improvised local boats to deliver food, clean water and fuel to hundreds of thousands of people stranded by flooded or destroyed roads in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand.</li><li>Calls for adaptation: Climate scientists interviewed about the disaster stress the need for practical adaptation measures such as relocating homes away from steep hillsides and riverbanks and enforcing land‑use rules to keep people out of the most hazard‑prone zones.</li></ul><blockquote>The focus has to shift from talking about climate change to really dealing with it on the ground and keep people away from vulnerable areas - Dr Akshay Deoras</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Indonesian government: Officials in Indonesia describe the flooding as some of the worst in years and have deployed soldiers and police to carry out mass evacuations, distribute emergency supplies and search for people believed to be buried under mud and debris.
