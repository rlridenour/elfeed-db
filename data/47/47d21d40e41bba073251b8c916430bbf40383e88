<p>Costa Rica held a general election on Sunday to choose a new president and fill all 57 seats in its Legislative Assembly, with outgoing President Rodrigo Chaves barred from re-election by term limits. The vote unfolded amid heightened concern about drug-trafficking-related violence, which multiple outlets say has increasingly shaped public debate and campaign priorities. Laura Fernández, a former chief of staff closely associated with Chaves, entered election day as the frontrunner in reporting and was presented as the candidate most likely to continue his governing approach. With many voters still undecided in late polling, several reports suggested the race could still hinge on turnout and whether a first-round win is possible or a runoff is required later in the year.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/MBM5lQHqP1sDB3F_VLL3raIl7gJAlBBjdv0g3b9IYzZrwc7_fHNKDOj57p33-2Ih_juSfC__oqE_3e9vmNsOVfV_nV555nLXGxR4gEtCQ7-Ujsjypl-mWt4uo_fUc7Hz4HGB_WTce9wcW17QGvNms5PaNhYV3gyyK8HMbirNm4ZZPH8D8aIueUGnCzEXj1r_OwbCuYceihRTfy8' alt='Laura Fernández at her closing campaign rally on Thursday night in San Antonio, Costa Rica.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Runoff rules: Costa Rica’s election system can require a second-round vote, and coverage highlighted April 5 as the potential runoff date if no candidate clears the threshold in the first round.</li><li>Tourism backdrop: Several reports noted Costa Rica’s global profile as a wildlife-and-beach tourism destination, making public safety a high-stakes issue for communities that depend on visitors.</li><li>Undecided voters: Pre-election polling described roughly a third of voters as still undecided, a factor that could reshape the final result even with a clear frontrunner narrative.</li><li>Democracy concerns: Some reporting framed the campaign around questions of institutional checks and balances, with warnings from critics about a possible authoritarian drift and counter-arguments centered on tougher governance and security.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Laura Fernández and the governing camp: Fernández has campaigned as the candidate to extend President Rodrigo Chaves’s approach, describing her intent to deepen the policy direction associated with his administration.
