<p>Apple has once again made a film focusing on people with disabilities, and how they use the company’s products. The <a href="https://www.apple.com/accessibility/designed-for-students">new film</a> celebrates <a href="https://globaldisabilityfund.org/international-day-of-persons-with-disabilities-2025/">International Day of Persons with Disabilities</a>, which is December 3. This time, the focus is on college students at both work and play, using Macs, iPhone and iPads, all while a music video-style soundtrack plays.</p>
<p>While some past films featuring people with disabilities have focused on heartwarming relationships, the new, unnamed film offers a bit more attitude, and a message that people with disabilities have often struggled to pass along – we’re not remarkable, or special, or inspiring. Just like everyone else, we’re happy, we’re sad, we’re frustrated, we’re joyous. And of course, we use Apple products and their built-in accessibility features.</p>
<p>The film was directed by Kim Gehrig, whose previous Apple film, <a href="https://vimeo.com/776811579">The Greatest</a>, earned an Emmy in 2022. It features performances from a wide range of deaf and disabled students from around the world, with songwriting and musical production from Tony award-winning composer Tim Minchin.</p>
<p>Accessibility tools featured in the film include magnifier for Mac, Braille access, accessibility reader, sound recognition, live captions and assistive touch.</p>
