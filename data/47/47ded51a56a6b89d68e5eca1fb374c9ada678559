</ul><h1>Very Lit</h1><p>What’s the first thing you learn in your first class on creative writing?</p>
<p>Show, don’t tell.</p>
<p>It’s a core tenet, which means, unsurprisingly, that it’s so often misapplied. Many ridiculously understand it to be a moratorium on declarative statements, and thus you end up with a six-hundred-word paragraph about drawing up blueprints and reading zoning laws and what have you, all to convey the simple fact that a character works as an architect.</p>
<p>What’s more, over time, you learn there are certain things that just don’t work very well on the page. Take a highly choreographed fight scene, for example. You love it when it’s Keanu on the screen, but a whole chapter of “He jab-stepped, working his way back on his heels to avoid the attacker’s punishing left-handed punch,” or whatever, and yikes. You’d be better off with something like, “They traded blows until each of them (and the room itself, for that matter) was a battered mess.”</p>
<p>These BlissLights outdoor projectors fit into this category. We could tell you, “These are pretty sweet,” and it would be more informative than if we took three words and tried to describe what they look like.</p>
<p>Luckily, here, in a digital medium, we don’t need to abide by “show, don’t tell.” We can do something different: “tell, and then show… a video.”</p>
<p>So, here’s the part where we tell:</p>
<p>You know the little lights you use to light your garden or the walkway between your garage and your house? These are like those, but trippy and cool.</p>
<p>And here’s the part where we show… a video:</p>

<p>Rad, right?</p>
<p>Oh, and as that video makes clear, these aren’t just plug-em-in-and-let-em-rip products. You can control them with an app and stuff.</p>
<p>Buy them if you want them. And honestly, we know you want them.</p>
