<li>Make water spicy!</li>
<li>Yes, it’s like that other thing you’ve heard of</li>
<li>No CO2 included (fits standard 60L cartridges)</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: It’d be better for making mojitos, actually</li>
</ul><h1>We're In Fizzness</h1><p>It’s amazing how much excitement some tiny bubbles can add, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Water is hydration. But seltzer? That’s a treat.</p>
<p>Pouring water into a cocktail? That’s diluting the flavor. Pouring seltzer into a cocktail? That’s making a lively little spritzer!</p>
<p>And it can help you <em>cut down</em> on alcohol, too. That tickle of carbonation makes seltzer feel just on the verge of naughty. A few dashes of a good sweet vinegar for bitterness and you’re in booze-free business!</p>
<p>It’s a guilt-free drink, is what we’re saying.</p>
<p>And that’s the problem.</p>
<p>Or, at least it is for me. The decision to crack open a can of seltzer is a little <em>too</em> easy and unencumbered. There are no carbs or calories or sugars or alcohol percentages to consider. No downside. Except, you know, the fact that seltzer isn’t free.</p>
<p>But it can be!</p>
<p>Or, well, you can make it yourself for very cheap. All you need is one of these things, a CO2 cylinder (which is not included, because, come on, do you really trust us to ship something like that?), and a faucet. Then it’s seltzer on demand, whenever you want.</p>
<p>You can use it to make plain old club soda, or you could add essences. Or, hell, you could buy some syrup (or make some) to concoct your own sodas. Which means you can have great pop whenever you want for even less than one of the bad kinds costs.</p>
<p>No, we’re not talking about whatever weird knock-off store brand stuff. We’re talking about those sodas that actively advertise their mediocrity, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broke-a Cola</li>
<li>Sierra Missed</li>
<li>Mountain Eww</li>
<li>Pre-Med Pepper</li>
<li>Spwrong</li>
<li>7-Down</li>
<li>Sun never-been-kist</li>
<li>Fainta</li>
<li>Deadbeat Dad’s Rootbeer</li>
<li>Meh-lo Yello</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, these are pretty silly. But this soda maker? It’s not silly at all. So get one, and get carbonating.</p>
