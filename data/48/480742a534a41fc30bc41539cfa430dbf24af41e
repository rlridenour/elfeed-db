The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> will be available in a total of nine color options, according to new information coming out of Asia.<br/>

According to the leaker going by the account name "<a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223929496579&navType=by">yeux1122</a>" on the Korean blog Naver, accessory manufacturers are now producing camera protector rings for the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; in colors to match their finishes upon release, thereby revealing what options to expect.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; will seemingly be available in <strong>black</strong>, <strong>silver</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, and <strong>purple</strong>. This lines up with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/20/iphone-17-purple-green-colors-rumor/">earlier report</a> which claimed Apple was testing green and purple color options for the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;.<br/>

<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will apparently be available in <strong>black</strong>, <strong>silver</strong>, <strong>gold</strong>, and <strong>blue</strong>. This corroborates previous rumors from the leakers known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/iphone-17-air-standout-color-option/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>" and "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/iphone-17-air-four-colors-rumored/">Majin Bu</a>".<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are available in black, white, pink, teal, and ultramarine. With the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, it looks like Apple is dropping pink and teal, replacing them with green and purple. Black, white, and ultramarine could become black, silver, and blue, but the essential palette should remain broadly the same for these three core colors.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;, which is set to replace the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, is moving to a much more muted, Pro-style selection of color options. This makes sense in light of Apple's repositioning of this second <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in the lineup toward something more premium with a distinctive, ultra-thin design.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; are expected to launch alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/">Naver</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/11/iphone-17-and-17-air-to-come-in-these-9-colors/">iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air Rumored to Come in These 9 Colors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-and-iphone-17-air-rumored-to-come-in-these-9-colors.2461359/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
