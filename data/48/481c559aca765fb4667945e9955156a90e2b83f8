Godmode Godmode1 is a handy mode that aims to ease the stress on otherwise stretching fingers by basically holding C- or M-C for you. A common difficulty is knowing if you are currently in Godmode or not, especially since I no longer use doom-modeline2. The first solution that is recommended is to change your cursor depending on whether you are in the mode or not. For years, back when I used godmode more rarely, this was enough.
