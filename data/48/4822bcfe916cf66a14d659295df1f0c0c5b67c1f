<p>My thanks to <a href="https://notify.pingie.com/">Notify!</a> for sponsoring Six Colors this week. Notify lets you stay effortlessly up-to-date with any changes on websites or RSS feeds that matter to you. It’s free and private, runs on your Apple devices, and there’s no server, subscription, or technical setup required.</p>
<p>Traditional monitoring requires servers, hosting, and complex setup. Notify! works instantly – whether tracking prices, monitoring news, or receiving alerts from your own apps and scripts. With Notify!, you can start monitoring in seconds by adding any website or RSS feed with a tap. Your device does all the work. Complete privacy, zero dependencies.</p>
<p>And that’s just the beginning. Notify! offers visual change detection, custom notifications, Shortcuts support, device groups, home screen widgets, a detailed history view, and even notifications about the status of your own devices.</p>
<p>Notify! is simple for everyone, with no coding required for RSS or website monitoring. But you can also push it to the limit, via an API for push notifications from your scripts, ChangeDetection.io integration, Zapier/Make/IFTTT automation, Apple Shortcuts compatibility, and custom webhook triggers.</p>
<p>Notify! is perfect for anyone wanting powerful monitoring without the complexity. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notify-web-script-notifier/id6748288936">Download it on the App Store</a> and start monitoring in seconds.</p>
