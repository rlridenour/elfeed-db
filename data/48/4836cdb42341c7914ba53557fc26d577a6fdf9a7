<p>Jonathan Wold and Luke Carbis cohost a podcast called Crossword, focusing mainly on WordPress and the open web. They occasionally invite guests to join them, and it was my pleasure to join them on their latest episode:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>John Gruber’s Dithering podcast with Ben Thompson was the original
inspiration for Crossword’s 15-minute format. Five years later,
John joins Luke and Jonathan for a wide-ranging conversation
covering open versus closed platforms, the history and impact of
Markdown, and a missed opportunity in WordPress. Luke goes on
about the good old days, Jonathan starts thinking about a rival
platform, and John makes a prediction for the ten-year follow-up
episode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While their usual format is a <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a>-esque 15 minutes, these special “perspectives” interviews run long. And unsurprisingly, mine ran long. I don’t write about the open web as much as I used to but I care about it as much as ever. I express some of my deep concerns <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack">about Substack in particular</a> in this interview.</p>
