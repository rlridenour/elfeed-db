<p>Apple’s newly updated AirTag model, informally called an AirTag 2 but just an “AirTag” to Apple, has a greater Bluetooth range, offers greater Precision Finding with newer iPhones, works with newer Apple Watch models, and produces sound Apple states is 50% louder than the original.</p>

<p>But if your iPhone or iPad isn’t running version 26.2.1, released a few days ago, you can’t add one of these new AirTags to it. And your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch<sup id="fnref-38448-models"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-38448-models" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup> won’t be able to locate it.</p>
<p>The original AirTag from 2021 works with the iPhone 6s and later and all iPhone SE models. iPad compatibility varies by model, starting with the iPad Air 2 in 2014. You need iOS 14.5/iPadOS 14.5 or later. The iPhone 11 and later added Precision Finding via an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio; it’s not available for any iPad. An Apple Watch requires watchOS 8 or later, on an Apple Watch Series 3 or later (2017). Macs gained Find My item access with macOS 12 Monterey in 2021, which sweeps in Macs mostly released in 2015, though a few older models qualify, too.<sup id="fnref-38448-pair"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-38448-pair" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This revised AirTag 2 thus breaks backwards compatibility in three ways, with one twist.</p>
<p>First, some older devices can’t see newer AirTags. The new tracker works with:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 11 and later, and 2nd and 3rd generation iPhone SE, as they’re the oldest that can install iOS 26. </li>
<li>The iPad comes in so many models, there’s a different minimum requirement for each for iPadOS 26; see <a href="https://www.apple.com/os/ipados/">the iPadOS 26 page</a>. These models were released between 2018 and 2020.</li>
<li>An Apple Watch has to be a Series 6 or later (2020), Ultra or later (2022), or SE 2 or later (2022) to install watchOS 26.</li>
<li>Tahoe requires that a Mac has an M-series chip or is one of a handful of late Intel models from 2019 and 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, people who have chosen not to update older devices compatible with the “26” releases can’t use the new AirTag.</p>
<p>Third, the twist: Because there’s no explicit labeling, it will be very difficult to tell the original and revised AirTag apart. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/26/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-airtag-2-and-the-original-airtag/">9to5Mac published an article</a> on this very topic, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If it’s an AirTag 1, the back will say: AirTag / Designed by Apple in California / Assembled in China / Bluetooth LE / Ultra Wideband.<br>
  If it’s an AirTag 2, the back will say: AirTag / FIND MY / NFC / BLUETOOTH LE / ULTRA WIDEBAND / IP67 / APPLE INC.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If there was ever a time for product naming and physical feature distinguishing, maybe this was it? Perhaps the AirTag 2 should have been matte black or space gray.</p>

<p>Why do I know so much (apparently) about AirTags? I wrote an entire book on the topic: <a href="https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/find-my-airtags/?pt=6COLORS">Take Control of Find My and AirTags</a>. I’ll be updating it in the next week or two to incorporate the new AirTag model and the provisos listed above.</p>
