<blockquote>
  <p>The two companies announced the blockbuster deal early Friday
morning. The takeover would give Netflix such beloved characters
as Batman, Harry Potter and Fred Flintstone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fred Flintstone?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted
Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a statement. “By combining
Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies — from
timeless classics like <em>Casablanca</em> and <em>Citizen Kane</em> to modern
favorites like <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Friends</em> — with our
culture-defining titles like <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>KPop Demon
Hunters</em> and <em>Squid Game</em>, we’ll be able to do that even better.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure <em>Squid Game</em> belongs in the same comparison as <em>Citizen Kane</em>, but the Warners library is incredibly deep. Stanley Kubrick’s post-<em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> films were all for Warner Bros.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Netflix’s cash and stock transaction is valued at about $27.75 per
Warner Bros. Discovery share. Netflix also agreed to take on more
than $10 billion in Warner Bros. debt, pushing the deal’s value to
$82.7 billion. [...] Warner’s cable channels, including CNN, TNT
and HGTV, are not included in the deal. They will form a new
publicly traded company, Discovery Global, in mid-2026.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know if this deal makes sense for Netflix, but Netflix has earned my trust. Netflix is a product-first company. They care about the quality of their content, their software, their service, and their brand. If you care about the Warner/HBO legacy, an acquisition by Netflix is a much, much better outcome than if David Ellison had bought it to merge with Paramount.</p>

<p>The LA Times article goes on to cite concerns from the movie theater industry, based on Netflix’s historic antipathy toward theatrical releases for its films. Netflix is promising to keep Warner Bros.’s film studio a separate operation, maintaining the studio’s current support for theatrical releases. I hope they do. I grew up loving going to the movies. I still enjoy it, but the truth is I go far less often as the years go on. Movie theaters shouldn’t be a protected class of business just because there’s so much affection and nostalgia for them. If they continue sliding into irrelevance, so be it. That’s how disruption, progress, and competition work.</p>
