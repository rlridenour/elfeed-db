Dell announced the UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor at CES 2026, billing it as the "world's first 52-inch 6K display." <br/>

At 52 inches, the ultra-wide curved monitor features a 21:9 aspect ratio with 6,144 x 2,560 resolution at 129 pixels per inch and supports refresh rates up to 120Hz.<br/>
<br/>
The display uses IPS Black panel technology for deeper blacks and improved contrast compared to standard IPS panels, with brightness listed as 400 cd/m. Dell says it emits up to 60% less blue light than competing monitors while maintaining professional-grade color accuracy, and it includes an ambient light sensor for eye comfort during extended use.<br/>
<br/>
The display's connectivity support is pretty eye-watering, since it basically doubles as a Thunderbolt dock around the back. It includes one Thunderbolt 4 port delivering up to 140W power delivery, two HDMI 2.1 ports, two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, three USB-C upstream ports, and several downstream USB-C and USB-A ports. If that wasn't enough, a 2.5Gbps Ethernet port rounds out the package.<br/>
<br/>
The monitor supports connecting up to four PCs simultaneously through its Picture-by-Picture mode with screen partitioning, while built-in KVM functionality allows users to control multiple connected machines with a single keyboard and mouse.<br/>

Dell is touting the display as a multi-monitor replacement for financial traders, data scientists, engineers, and executives who need maximum screen real estate, so naturally it doesn't come cheap: The UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-52-thunderbolt-hub-monitor-u5226kw/apd/210-bthw/monitors-monitor-accessories">available now from the Dell website</a> for &#36;2,899 with a stand or &#36;2,799 without.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/">CES 2026</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/07/dell-52-inch-6k-monitor-with-thunderbolt/">CES 2026: Dell Unveils World&#039;s First 52-Inch 6K Thunderbolt Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2026-dell-unveils-worlds-first-52-inch-6k-thunderbolt-display.2475711/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
