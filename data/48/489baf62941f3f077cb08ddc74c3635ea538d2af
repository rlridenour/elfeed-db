<p>The Steve Jobs Archive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To mark <em>Toy Story</em>’s 30th anniversary, we’re sharing a
never-before-seen interview with Steve from November 22, 1996 — exactly one year after the film debuted in theaters.</p>

<p><em>Toy Story</em> was the world’s first entirely computer-animated
feature-length film. An instant hit with audiences and critics, it
also transformed Pixar, which went public the week after its
premiere. Buoyed by <em>Toy Story</em> ’s success, Pixar’s stock price
closed at nearly double its initial offering, giving it a market
valuation of approximately $1.5 billion and marking the largest
IPO of 1995. The following year, <em>Toy Story</em> was nominated for
three Academy Awards en route to winning a Special Achievement
Oscar in March. In July, Pixar announced that it would close its
television-commercial unit to focus primarily on feature films. By
the time of the interview, the team had grown by 70 percent in
less than a year; <em>A Bug’s Life</em> was in production; and behind the
scenes, Steve was using his new leverage to renegotiate Pixar’s
partnership with Disney.</p>

<p>Kind of a weird interview. The video quality is poor, and whoever was running the camera zoomed in and out awkwardly. It’s like ... just a VHS tape? But it’s also weird in a cool way to get a “new” Steve Jobs interview in 2025, and Jobs, as ever, is thoughtful and insightful. Well worth 23 minutes of your time.</p>

<p>There’s a particularly interesting bit at the end when Jobs discusses how Pixar was half a computer company (with extraordinary technology) and half a movie studio (with extraordinary filmmaking talent), but eventually they had to choose between the two industries for how to pay their employees to motivate them to remain at Pixar. The Hollywood way would be with contracts; the Silicon Valley way would be with stock options. Jobs chose the Silicon Valley path for Pixar.</p>
