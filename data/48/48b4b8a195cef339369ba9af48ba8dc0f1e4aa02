<p>The U.S. aviation system faced mounting disruption as thousands of flights were canceled or delayed after air traffic controllers and other federal staff went unpaid during a prolonged government shutdown, prompting the Federal Aviation Administration to require flight reductions at major airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned the slowdown could worsen into the Thanksgiving travel period if the shutdown continues, and airlines have already begun canceling service in response to staffing shortfalls and FAA directives. Federal officials and airline executives are negotiating operational limits while lawmakers debate funding, leaving travelers facing uncertainty during a peak holiday window.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SUC_F1v1Um7gAuK8VFzdh5TzAx6Vxyq5GPnHwvj_4k5_7XVOoqr8cODUT7SLUoddRLikQ1v6J14ni6Sw7xSAjs70Qc-ruHQXLyRwqPKNQYkRJTGdElRuLre7fWnIR23lvqm8V7JxYHkGJitmQDx0oSvvsW5V4PVyRW-S-4nu_lBUKc2wCzq_VgfdosfyPMTGn476XfCscDC8uy_RGNog20Z3xQccY7A2KCnud8-DTByWUh5jN89TXzDrIP6m4DdakJjqGBTXKyF-tx18pA' alt='Travelers wait at a video board at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, Sunday, Nov. 9, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Cancellation surge: On Saturday, carriers recorded about 1,500 cancellations and roughly 6,000 delays, up from about 1,025 cancellations the previous day, as air-traffic staffing gaps spread across the system.</li><li>Airports affected: Staffing issues touched 42 airport towers and delayed operations in at least 12 major U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Newark, San Francisco, Chicago and New York.</li><li>Mandated reductions: The FAA ordered airlines to cut roughly 4% of daily flights at 40 busy airports starting last Friday, with cuts scheduled to rise to about 6% and then 10% by November 14 if shortages persist.</li><li>Operational strain: Airline officials said the proliferation of ground-delay programs and mandated reductions made scheduling nearly impossible and raised private concerns about maintaining safe, reliable operations.</li><li>Political response: Lawmakers traded blame over the funding stalemate even as a Senate stopgap deal raised hopes for a short-term end to the shutdown and relief for travel disruptions.</li></ul><blockquote>Air traffic in the U.S. could &quot;slow to a trickle&quot; if the federal government shutdown lingers into the busy Thanksgiving travel holiday season. - Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy: He warned air traffic could &quot;slow to a trickle&quot; into the Thanksgiving travel period if the shutdown continues, urging a resolution.
