<p>US Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, a 20‑year‑old West Virginia National Guard member, has died from gunshot wounds sustained in an ambush while patrolling near the White House in Washington, DC, President Trump announced on Thursday. Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe, a 24‑year‑old Air Force guardsman, remains hospitalized in critical condition after the same attack, which federal authorities are investigating as a suspected act of terrorism. The alleged gunman, identified as 29‑year‑old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was wounded in a firefight with other guardsmen, taken into custody, and is accused of firing at close range on the pair just blocks from the presidential residence. US officials say Lakanwal entered the country in 2021 under an evacuation program for at‑risk Afghans after the Taliban takeover and later received asylum, and they have confirmed he previously worked with CIA‑backed counterterrorism units in Afghanistan. President Trump has blamed vetting under the prior administration for allowing Lakanwal into the US and has ordered wide‑ranging reviews of Afghan immigration cases, green cards from 19 countries, and asylum decisions linked to similar programs.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Nk_hbmmbhm8MeYYadXrNB8UTqWoA-tw-ZXTag0psT9NXoYx3GAOPNElzn7YKUxN7nxc6OtfQ5tcqHNCHCN89SgsmaJPKJY1UjWDpXCtwp7IOKpSm8V12qfo4XB3Y3sBcpJ9mZ7WCZnXMlrrOI3vjCslfdK3E4s6I30nOx9NyTCbUVOocB63xkBHsqSbzi53JBkkRrzReVsSQ7E8RiM7GErEBC-2LAh7Xx1iceZYg08zgvMTDs-MqbwO6bZE' alt='National Guard troops stand near security barriers in central Washington, DC, after the shooting near the White House.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Victims’ backgrounds: Specialist Sarah Beckstrom joined the West Virginia National Guard in 2023 and had been deployed to Washington, DC, since August, while fellow guardsman Andrew Wolfe serves as an Air Force staff sergeant, according to profiles published after the attack.</li><li>FBI terrorism probe: The FBI has opened a terrorism investigation into the shooting, treating the incident as a potential politically or ideologically motivated attack rather than a random crime.</li><li>Suspect’s CIA-linked past: Nonprofit and intelligence sources say Lakanwal previously served in an elite CIA‑backed paramilitary or ‘partner force’ unit in Afghanistan, including work as a GPS tracker specialist in the Scorpion Forces.</li><li>Operation Allies Welcome: Lakanwal entered the US in September 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, a program designed to relocate Afghans who worked with US forces after the Taliban’s return to power, before his later grant of asylum.</li><li>Immigration policy response: Following the shooting, the Trump administration announced a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of green cards for immigrants from Afghanistan and 18 other countries, alongside a broad review of asylum cases originating from designated states.</li></ul><blockquote>She’s no longer with us.
