The software updates will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/blood-oxygen-monitoring-returning-to-apple-watch/">re-enable the Blood Oxygen feature</a> on Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 models sold in the United States.<br/>

It is unclear if iOS 18.6.1 will include anything else, such as bug fixes or security patches. Overall, it is likely to be a minor update. Apple is now focused on iOS 26, which is deep into beta testing ahead of a general release in September.<br/>
