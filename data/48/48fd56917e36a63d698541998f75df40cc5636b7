Disney last increased the price of Disney+ in October 2024, so prices are going up again after just a year. Prior to October 2024, Disney+ ad-free was &#36;13.99 per month and Disney+ with ads was &#36;7.99 per month.<br/>

After Disney raised its prices in October 2024 and started cracking down on password sharing, it lost 700,000 subscribers. It is a curious time for Disney to implement a Disney+ price increase given the recent reaction to Disney's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel's show off of the air.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Disney-owned network ABC said that Jimmy Kimmel Live would no longer be aired, leading to a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/pressure-mounts-disney-kimmel-suspension-boycott-calls-spread-rcna232396">social media campaign</a> encouraging subscribers to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions. Disney <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/disney-says-jimmy-kimmel-will-return-air-tuesday-2025-09-22/">reversed its decision</a> following the backlash, but the price increase could prevent some subscribers from returning to the service.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/">Disney Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/23/disney-plus-price-increase-2025/">Disney+ Getting Another Price Hike</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-getting-another-price-hike.2467269/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
