Intro I used a recursive git rename, but thoughtlessly used it at the top level of my project, where my .git could be effected. Git then broke on all commands with error,
fatal: unknown index entry format 0x72000000
Thankfully this can be easily fixed by removing and resetting the git index1.
$ rm -rf .git/index $ git reset Instead of the rm I just moved the git to a safe place in case I needed something less destructive.
