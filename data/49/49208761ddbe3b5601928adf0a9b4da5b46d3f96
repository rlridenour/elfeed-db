Brian Partridge’s sermon this past Sunday was a perfect antidote to our annual festival of accumulation thinly disguised as a celebration of the birth of Christ. So, I guess I should stop browsing ebay.  Here is the prayer for the week:
</p>

 <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Let me not be deceived; <br></br>
these things that I possess, <br></br>
do I use them, <br></br>
or do they use me?
</p>

 <p>
Help me to loosen my grip <br></br>
on that which I so tightly grasp, <br></br>
so that I can open my hands to you.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
