</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
With one #solo #rpg session in the books, I take a bit to assess and reflect on my experience.  Will there be more sessions?  I’ll need to Ask the Stars.
</p>
        <p>What follows are my reflections on <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/12/08/forged-from-the-worst-session-1/">Forged from the Worst: Session 1</a>.</p>
<p>I reviewed the aggregate list of resources from <a href="https://elmc.at/running-mythic-bastionland/#resources">Running Mythic
Bastionland</a>.  Reading Chris McDowall’s <a href="https://www.bastionland.com/2025/04/landmark-sites-sanctum.html">BASTIONLAND: Landmark Sites - Sanctum</a>, I
think of how quick I placed Sir Weydlyn in the presence of a <em>Seer</em>.  Something to
consider going forward.</p>
<p>Then, I listened to <a href="https://luckroll.blogspot.com/2025/03/mythic-bastionland-knotte-session-1.html">Luck Roll: Mythic Bastionland - Knotte - Session 1</a>, I must
consider that Sir Weydlyn appeared <em>en media res</em> .  Which works, but
I’ll want to consider the question: “Why this realm?”</p>
<p>With those larger contexts, I’m going to dive into my thoughts.</p>
<p>First and foremost, combat is intense and decisive.  With a 17 Vigor, it feels
like Sir Weydlyn can safely <em>Smite</em>.  But his other Virtues are low, meaning I can
only assume he could use one of these once, before experiencing <em>Fatigue</em>.</p>
<p>The combat decisions feel meaningful; do I go for maximum damage or attempt a
<em>Gambit</em> to sustain, press, or create an advantage?  Having given Sir Weydlyn the
initiative, and allowing for an initial burst was perhaps generous, but given my
exploration of the system feels appropriate.</p>
<p>With his high <em>Guard</em>, <em>Vigor</em> and <em>Armor</em> 2, charging into a volley of arrows likely
wouldn’t have changed much.  It really was the <em>Burst</em> that set the stage for the
rout.</p>
<p>Next, those seers.  Reading those terse three bullet points, I felt as though I
could play to the weirdness and idiosyncrasies of the Tangled Seer.  I’d imagine
at a group table in which I were running these games, I’d feel that exhilaration
of improvising a bit of apparent insanity.</p>
<p>One thing I want to remember is to also briefly study the image associated with
the seer; it too is evocative and operates at a different level from the seer’s
text.</p>
<p>In writing the dialogue of Sir Weydlyn, and his announcement of no quarter, I
knew that Squire Kelwun, with his piety and witness to an execution, could
provide a good foil to the grim nature of his knight.  So I chose to introduce
tension and sustain it.</p>
<p>From a play stand-point, I found considerable utility having the PDF of <cite><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514996/mythic-bastionland?affiliate_id=318171">Mythic Bastionland</a></cite> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Mythic Bastionland”" title="Other site-wide references of “Mythic Bastionland”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-MYTHIC-BASTIONLAND">&#128214;</a></small>
 and bookmarking specific pages.  As I write this, and know the
auguries at the bottom of the book, I am contemplating a function to “open the
PDF to a random Knight/Seer or Myth page.”  So that I might quickly reference
those tables (without need of transcription).</p>
<p>As I was playing, and Squire Kelwun suggested traveling to the tower, I felt
that direction served three aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the fictional tension between squire and knight.</li>
<li>Set in motion two settlements.</li>
<li>Create a location triangle in the fiction: tower, castle, and lake.</li>
</ul>
<p>Digging into that location triangle a bit more, I’ve encumbered Sir Weydlyn with
a <em>Promise</em> to a Seer to go to the castle, a begrudged acceptance that offloading
prisoners sooner rather than later makes sense, and knowledge that a <em>Myth</em> (and
adventure) lurks near the silver lake.</p>
<p>Heading towards the tower also moves towards answering that lingering setup
question about the <em>fancy bandits</em> relation to the settlement.  Oh the vindication
that Sir Weydlyn will feel if they return those prisoners not to justice but to
their awaiting homes and friends.</p>
<p>Aside from character creation and generating the map (as well as what you read
in the <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/12/08/forged-from-the-worst-session-1/">Forged from the Worst: Session 1</a>) I have done no additional preparation.
My plan is to do this all <em>just in time</em>.  What this means is as knight and squire
head towards the tower, I’ll determine if there’s a barrier.  I have a bit of
preparation to translate realm creation for a traditional GM role into a process
for solo exploration.</p>
<p>Yes, I could establish all of the barriers, and know them ahead of time.
However, I find a narrative excitement when playing and needing to consult an
oracle for information regarding the world.  That oracle is bringing forth
personal symbols from my experiences, interweaving them with the language and
prompts of both the oracle’s words and images, as well as the fiction as
presented.</p>
<p>In other words, I can use all of this to <em>play to find out</em> .</p>
<p>Last, I think about two solo campaigns.  First <time datetime="2024-10" title="2024-10">in the fall of last year</time>, I was
exploring <span><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/2/chaosium?keyword=pendragon?affiliate_id=318171">Pendragon</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Pendragon”" title="Other site-wide references of “Pendragon”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-PENDRAGON">&#128214;</a></small>
, see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a Family History for Pendragon</li>
<li>On Starting a Solo Pendragon Campaign</li>
<li>The Great Pendragon Campaign: Year 490</li>
</ul>
<p>But I lost steam.  Why?  Well there was a disheartening election, paired with
moving into our house, and closing our retail store.  Then, I found myself
really enjoying reading a myriad of books.  The time and space away from the
game, has me thinking fondly of the system and the mini-game of character
creation.</p>
<p>Second, I think of The Travels of Duinhir Tailwind.  I haven’t fully closed that
game out, but I’m looking at the character sheet of Duinhir Tailwind versus Sir
Weydlyn, and appreciate the terse nature.</p>
<p><cite>Mythic Bastionland</cite>
 has less character sheet overhead, which I find refreshing.
And while the Virtues and Passions of <span>Pendragon</span>
 are fantastic for solo-play, a
flavorful oracle can do quite a lot of work.</p>
<p>And, there’s the cognitive load/fatigue of playing a game in such a well
established world.  There’s the mood and tone to consider, but also the
“fiction” as established.  I’ll see how the travel procedures of <cite>Mythic Bastionland</cite>
 play out.</p>
<p>Which is to say, for now, I’ve found a nice shiny to play with.  And I’m
enjoying the writing opportunity as well as building my toolbox for running this
game.  Now, to write that <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
 function to lookup random pages.</p>
