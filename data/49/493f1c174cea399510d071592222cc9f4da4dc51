<blockquote>
  <p>The company has promoted its Brad Pitt racing film with
advertisements across at least six iPhone apps leading up to
today’s wide release, including the App Store, Apple Wallet,
Apple Sports, Apple Podcasts, iTunes Store, and of course the
Apple TV app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of those apps have ads in them all the time. It’s certainly fine for Apple to use those ad spots to promote their own movie. Even with Apple Sports, which most of the time has no ads at all, I think it’s fine for Apple to occasionally drop a promotion in there for something of their own. And <em>F1 The Movie</em> is a sports movie. The Apple Wallet push notification isn’t just a little different, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/more_on_apples_trust-eroding_f1_the_movie_wallet_ad">it’s a lot different</a>.</p>

<p>I will also note one other sort-of promotion. I play the mini crossword every morning in Apple News. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/apple-news-mini-crossword-f1.png">Today’s 1-down clue</a> was “<em>F1 The Movie</em> star Brad ____”. I think that’s a clever on-brand tie-in. Fun, not obnoxious. But with the smell of that Wallet push-notification fart still hanging in the air, not as much fun as it otherwise would have been.</p>
