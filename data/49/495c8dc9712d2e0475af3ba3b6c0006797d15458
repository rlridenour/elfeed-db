Matthias over at <a href="https://www.pffr.online">Ahoi Blog</a> makes an observation that I&rsquo;ve also made many times: Discussion about Emacs startup times ends as soon as you run Emacs as a daemon. The startup is instantaneous and if you prefer a Vim-like way of operating where you start and stop Emacs each time you need it you can have it. Of course, Emacs doesn&rsquo;t really stop. It&rsquo;s still running as a daemon and will pop up a new frame for you whenever you need one.

With this model, the Emacs startup time is absorbed into the system boot time, which presumably happens rarely. The question is, how to get the daemon started. If you want to have it happen at boot time, the exact method depends on your operating system.

Matthias shows <a href="https://www.pffr.online/blog/emacs/running-emacs-daemon-with-style/">how to do this in Linux</a>. It&rsquo;s a little finicky because of systemd but really just amounts to making an entry in a configuration file. You can see the details in his post. The other issue is how to start, stop, and interact with the Emacs daemon when it&rsquo;s running. Matthias has a simple script that automates all that so that you don&rsquo;t worry about the intricacies of <code>systemctl</code> and <code>journalctl</code>.

The other possibility is to simply never exit Emacs. That&rsquo;s what I do. I run it in its own workspace so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about hiding it when it&rsquo;s not in use. I also start server mode so that I can instantly pop up a frame (either GUI or terminal) if I want to for some reason. I really do think this is the best solution but others obviously disagree. If you like to bring up your editor when you need it, quit when you don&rsquo;t, and your editor is Emacs, you should take a look at Matthias&rsquo; post. It will tell you how to run Emacs the way you want to and you&rsquo;ll never have to think about startup time again.</p>
