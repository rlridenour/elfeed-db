<p><a href="https://ellanew.com/2026/01/05/ptpl-189-old-text-files-relief-for-my-brain" title="wikilink">Last week</a> I wrote about how visually simplifying the way I use plain text, has been good for my brain. I also said that things that are unnecessary, but which make you smile, are okay too (as long as your system works without them).</p>
<p>So what can you do, as someone who enjoys experimenting with plain text, to make it look …better?</p>
<h3 id="ask-why"><strong>Ask <span class="small-caps">WHY</span></strong></h3>
<p>Before adding anything at all to your beautiful plain text (raw letters A–Z, numbers, punctuation), ask yourself <em>why</em> you want to make it<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>look better”. If the answer is that it’s too boring, <span class="small-caps">STOP</span>. Boring is the <em>point</em>, my people! We’re trying to focus on the content, not throw a party for our eyeballs.</p>
<p>Of course plain text is boring. The <em>right</em> kind. Once you’re certain you are either pursuing clarity or focus-friendly self-expression and not falling into distraction mode, continue on.</p>

<p>The keyboard (letters A-Z, numbers 0-9, punctuation, space bar, return key, etc.) is all you need to spruce up many day-to-day notes. You have at your disposal —</p>
<ul>
<li>Spacing - paragraph, line, word</li>
<li>Indentation</li>
<li>Capitals</li>
<li>Horizontal rules</li>
<li>Underline</li>
<li>Alignment - centre, range left, range right</li>
</ul>
<p>Those of you fortunate enough to be in possession of that paragon of plain text, the humble typewriter, can dabble in more freeform self-expression. See <a href="https://www.jamescookartworkshop.com/collections/shop" target="_blank">James Cook</a>, <a href="https://www.cerebralpalsy.org/inspiration/artists/paul-smith" target="_blank">Paul Smith</a>, and a history of the art from <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/05/23/typewriter-art-laurence-king/" target="_blank">The Marginalian</a>.

<p>The sensory cost of using a typewriter is something enthusiasts are happy, even delighted, to pay. Sadly that’s not me, even though I learned to type on one and think of them fondly. The noise made by both typewriters and mechanical keyboards (the latter is a cult!) doesn’t fit my current need to be able to type as quietly as possible.</p>
<p>One more potential sensory cost of using an old fashioned typewriter or a mechanical keyboard: the distraction of the device itself. There’s nothing inherently wrong with joining a typewriter club and collecting various vintage models, or with replacing some of your keycaps with <a href="https://hirosarts.com/artisan-keycaps/" target="_blank">moulded works of art</a>; but it’s vital to clearly separate aesthetics and collectibility from function.</p>
<h3 id="use-invisible-characters"><strong>Use invisible characters</strong></h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/c7fd4a4e-bf11-4d30-a0c8-ac1520cdc096/ptpl-190-invisible-closeup.png" alt="Screenshot of a page of text with 2 lines of neatly spaced and aligned wiki links forming a menu" width="982" height="528"> <em>Example of adjusting blank space to align elements</em></p>
<hr>
<p>You can adjust the spacing of letters, words, and symbols with<br>
<a href="https://www.editpad.org/tool/invisible-character" target="_blank">invisible characters</a> such as the em space or hair space.</p>
<p>I’ve done that with wiki link menu items (in a mono spaced font) on my Life Dashboard page, when single spacing was too little and double spacing was too much. The spacing needed will depend on the font you choose.</p>
<h3 id="use-the-interpunct-or-middle-dot"><strong>Use the interpunct, or middle dot</strong></h3>
<p>The interpunct, or middle dot, is a subtle but effective way of separating text. It’s subtler than a bullet (· vs •) and less visually disruptive than a vertical pipe (|). <a href="https://ellanew.com/2022/06/27/typography-interpunct-lists" title="wikilink">Read more of what I’ve written on the interpunct</a></p>
<h3 id="use-markdown"><strong>Use <a href="https://markdown.co.in/blog/history-of-markdown.html" target="_blank">Markdown</a></strong></h3>
<p>Markdown is a highly portable method of adding formatting to text. I can type two asterisks to make a word **bold** in one app, and expect to see it looking bold in other Markdown-friendly environments.</p>
<p>Text can be made easier to navigate both visually and technically with <em>judicious</em> use of <a href="https://markdown.co.in/blog/history-of-markdown.html" target="_blank">Markdown</a>. Headers, bold, italic, highlighting, horizontal rules, ordered and unordered lists, checkboxes and more.</p>
<p>Remember good design principles! No dog’s dinners, please.</p>
<p>Karl Voit’s <a href="https://karl-voit.at/2021/11/27/orgdown/" target="_blank">Orgdown</a> is another option. (Karl hates Markdown with a passion, but I don’t see the problem. A simple find and replace can have you switch from one to the other fairly quickly.)</p>
<h3 id="use-emojis"><strong>Use emojis</strong></h3>
<p>Add interest and avoid distraction by being light-handed with emojis in your text. Use them only when doing so will add clarity or subtle visual interest to your work.</p>
<p>Johnny Decimal uses them in folder and file names to provide visual cues for his Life Admin system. I use them to classify events in my plain text planner, making it easy to see at a glance the difference between upcoming <span class="small-caps">🎁</span> Birthdays and <span class="small-caps">🟢</span> School Holidays, and as symbols for menu items on my Life Dashboard page (see image, above).</p>
<p>When considering using emojis as part of your plain text workflow, ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the emoji serve a practical function like reducing reading or scanning time? If it adds visual friction, leave it out.</li>
<li>Can the emoji be easily replaced by a single word, symbol, or space, without loss of meaning? If so, leave it out — unless you are deliberately being ornamental. (Nothing wrong with giving your <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/joie-de-vivre" target="_blank">joie de vivre</a> a boost every now and then!)</li>
<li>Will adding an emoji make your text less functional or future-proof? Emojis in file names can be problematic when it comes to sorting, syncing, and cross-platform rendering.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="apps-plugins-css"><strong>Apps, plugins, <span class="small-caps">CSS</span></strong></h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/ffba11cd-fa3c-4cbe-8a9e-912bef3b8b50/ptpl-190-checkboxes.png" alt="Two columns of text showing different symbols to use within the usual Markdown square bracketed checkboxes, with the end result as depicted in the Obsidian Minimal theme" width="1348" height="868"> <em>Alternative checkbox symbols, as shown in Obsidian’s Minimal theme</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Many apps (eg. Obsidian, iA Writer, Marked 2) can change the style, font, and colour of your plain text. Hand-coded <span class="small-caps">CSS</span> is another option, if that is in your skillset.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.obsidian.md/callouts" target="_blank">Callouts in Obsidian</a> can use emoji-type symbols and background colours to indicate the category of a side note.</p>
<p>Alternative checkboxes are another option.</p>
<p>Beware of anything that adds things (like invisible characters) to your raw text, especially when those additions rely on specific apps or plugins to function.</p>
<h3 id="in-sum"><strong>In sum</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Plain text (letters A-Z, numbers 0-9, punctuation), used well, is both functional and beautiful</li>
<li>Plain text can be added upon in various ways to add clarity, visual interest, and self-expression</li>
<li>Adding anything to plain text (formatting, Org mode, plugins) increases the likelihood of distraction, so be clear on why you are doing it</li>
<li>Choose your rabbit holes wisely! Some are fun ways to spend a free afternoon, while others have the potential to become focus-destroying obsessions.</li>
