Apple TV has "no plans" to launch an ad-supported streaming tier for the platform, according to Apple's head of services Eddy Cue, speaking in interview with <em><a href="https://edition.pagesuite.com/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=a04b0b1b-3c41-4db4-8e10-bd27650bed81">Screen International</a></em>.<br/>

Asked if there were plans for a tier with ads, Cue said: "Nothing at this time. Again, I don't want to say no forever, but there are no plans." <br/>
<br/>
Cue added that if Apple TV can stay aggressive with its pricing, then it's better for consumers not to have their viewing experience interrupted by ads. <br/>
<br/>
Apple TV cost just &#36;4.99 per month in the U.S. when it launched in 2019, but the price has since increased three times. The price went up to &#36;6.99 per month in 2022, and then to &#36;9.99 per month in 2023, and now the service costs &#36;12.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
Many other streaming services like Disney+ and Netflix have raised prices in recent years, but both rivals have also launched ad-supported plans as lower-priced tiers that have proven popular with customers.<br/>
