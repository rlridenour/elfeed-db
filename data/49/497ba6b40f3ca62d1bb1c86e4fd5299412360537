<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gandhi-Changing-Mohandas-Karamchand-published/dp/B015GRZTP2">Gandhi: Radical Wisdom for a Changing World</a>:</p>
<h2>Anger</h2>
<p>&quot;I do get angry, but I feel angry with myself for it. Full conquest of anger is possible only through self-realization. We should love even those who have the worst opinion of us. This is ahimsa, the rest is only ignorance.&quot;</p>
<h2>Bad handwriting</h2>
<p>&quot;I am now of opinion that children should first be taught the art of drawing before learning how to write. Let the child learn his letters by observation as he does different objectives, such as flowers, birds, etc., and let him learn handwriting only after he has learned to draw objects.&quot;</p>
<h2>Conduct of the Ashram</h2>
<p>&quot;Service without humility is selfishness and egotism.&quot;</p>
<h2>Eating</h2>
<p>&quot;There is a great deal of truth in the saying that man becomes what he eats. The grosser the food, the grosser the body.&quot;</p>
<h2>Heart</h2>
<p>&quot;There are chords in every human heart. If we only know how to strike the right chord, we bring out the music.&quot;</p>
<h2>Moral law</h2>
<p>The law of truth and love.</p>
<h2>Renouncing or forgoing</h2>
<p>Nishkulanand sings: &quot;Renunciation of objects, without the renunciation of desires, is short-lived, however hard you may try.&quot;</p>
<h2>Silence</h2>
<p>&quot;Man spoils matters much more by speech than by silence.&quot;</p>
<h2>Time</h2>
<p>&quot;Every minute that runs to waste never returns. Yet, knowing this, how much time do we waste?&quot;</p>
<h2>The palate</h2>
<p>&quot;Turn to the birds and beasts, and what do you find? They never eat merely to please the palate, they never go on eating till their inside is full to overflowing. And yet, we regard ourselves as superior to the animal creation!&quot;</p>
<h2>Vow of Swadeshi</h2>
<p>&quot;The person who has taken the vow of swadeshi will never use articles which conceivably involve violation of truth in their manufature or on the part of their manufacturers.&quot;</p>
