Instead of juggling multiple subscriptions and clunky web tools, you can now access models like <strong>ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Pro, Grok, LLaMA, or Perplexity</strong> all from a single interface.</p>
<p id="p3">Designed for professionals, students, and creatives, Fello AI simplifies everyday tasks such as coding, research, writing, and brainstorming. It can perform <strong>real-time web search</strong> to ensure that answers reflect the latest news and are up to date.</p>
<p id="p4">Fello AI is also a powerful tool for file analysis, letting you <strong>chat with up to 16 PDFs, documents, or images</strong> <strong>at once</strong>. Whether you&rsquo;re summarizing reports, reviewing contracts, writing image captions or extracting key data, AI makes it effortless.</p>
<p id="p5">The app&rsquo;s advanced interface includes a <strong>prompt library</strong> for saving frequently used commands, <strong>conversation pinning</strong> for quick access to important chats, and <strong>bookmarking</strong> to keep track of key insights&mdash;helping you stay organized and efficient.</p>
<p id="p6">Built natively for macOS, Fello AI delivers a fast, smooth experience that integrates seamlessly with your system. With features like drag-and-drop file uploads, keyboard shortcuts, and system-wide search, the app feels right at home in the Mac ecosystem.</p>
<p id="p7">Instead of paying hundreds of dollars per month to access multiple AI models separately, Fello AI brings them all together in one app for <strong>less than $10 per month</strong>. With a single subscription, you get unlimited messaging, file analysis, and access to all supported AI models&mdash;making it the smartest and most cost-effective way to use AI on macOS. <a href="https://felloai.com/?utm_source=macstories&amp;utm_medium=article" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about Fello AI</a>.</p>
