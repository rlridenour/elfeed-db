<p>Honduras’s presidential race remains unresolved after the electoral authority reported a “technical tie” between two conservative candidates, with businessman and former Tegucigalpa mayor Nasry Asfura holding a lead of just over five hundred votes against TV-host-turned-politician Salvador Nasralla in partial tallies from Sunday’s election. The National Electoral Council said the near deadlock reflects only a digital count from a portion of polling stations and urged citizens to remain calm while more ballots are processed, including those transported from remote areas. President Trump openly backed Asfura during the campaign and later alleged, without presenting evidence, that Honduran officials were manipulating the count against his preferred candidate, injecting US domestic politics into the country’s already tense electoral environment. Honduran authorities and observers continue tallying results, with attention focused both on the integrity of the process and on how Washington’s funding and cooperation with Honduras might shift depending on who ultimately wins.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/cwC25hH1Iya8tey_Eh2ajS-2FG24Otf_l6uSBcCf8Oh62e5q5WRInsStc8ztUJmMReEjuaiLwgKoQvRDqrOSquwqEKp4QiyzmYZ7oGs5Ly63DSan86IrrSmimV_ytM-Nh48DZrExK3rdDc0IOYb39hSEK3-p0K72WgWTpMsu64Is6QDbbhq5JHT8-kHnbkGM1cTBzPIGRolLLQ' alt='Soldiers carry ballot boxes from rural polling stations at an airport in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, as votes are transported for centralized counting.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Trump’s endorsement: During the campaign, President Trump publicly endorsed Nasry Asfura and framed the choice as one between a partner who would work closely with Washington on migration and security and opponents he described as less reliable for US interests.</li><li>Aid and leverage: The President warned that if Asfura did not prevail, the United States would reconsider sending financial assistance to Honduras, saying Washington would “not be throwing good money after bad” at a government led by his rivals.</li><li>Governing party trailing: Preliminary results showed the incumbent governing party’s candidate lagging far behind the two leading conservatives, signaling voter appetite for change in leadership even as the top contenders campaigned on right-leaning platforms.</li><li>Debate over US role: Honduran analysts and voters expressed differing views on Trump’s interventions, with some seeing US attention as a potential source of investment and others criticizing it as undue foreign influence in a sovereign election.</li><li>Ballot transport logistics: Soldiers and election workers moved ballot boxes from rural polling stations by air to the capital to centralize counting, a process officials said was necessary given Honduras’s challenging terrain and dispersed communities.</li></ul><blockquote>This is a technical tie. - Ana Paola Hall</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>National Electoral Council of Honduras: Council president Ana Paola Hall described the result as a “technical tie” and called for patience and calm while more votes from across the country are incorporated into the official tally.
