<p>Britain’s MI5 issued a rare public warning on Monday to members of parliament and their staff—via its National Protective Security Authority—urging vigilance against espionage and “foreign interference” linked to China, Russia and Iran [scmp.com#4][rt.com#2][euronews.com#5]. The guidance details tactics such as phishing, blackmail, overt flattery, and “enticing” online approaches by fake recruiters, and encourages promptly reporting suspicious contacts to security teams [straitstimes.com#1][euronews.com#5][rt.com#2]. The warning follows last week’s abandonment of a UK case against two men accused of spying for China after prosecutors said the government had not provided evidence that China constitutes a national security threat [scmp.com#4]. MI5 also recorded more than 20,000 instances in 2023 of foreign actors using networking sites to seek sensitive information, underscoring the digital dimension of the risk [rt.com#2].</p><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who’s targeted: MI5, through its National Protective Security Authority, warned MPs and staff of long-term foreign interference tied to China, Russia and Iran [rt.com#2][euronews.com#5][scmp.com#4].</li><li>Common tactics: Threats include phishing and blackmail, as well as vague private meetings, overt flattery, and online &#x27;recruiter&#x27; approaches offering enticing opportunities [straitstimes.com#1][euronews.com#5][rt.com#2].</li><li>Practical steps: The advice urges politicians to trust instincts, track odd interactions, and report concerns quickly to security teams [rt.com#2].</li><li>Legal backdrop: The alert comes a week after prosecutors dropped a China-linked UK spying trial due to absent government evidence that China is a national security threat [scmp.com#4].</li><li>Online vector: MI5 recorded over 20,000 instances in 2023 of foreign actors using networking sites to gather sensitive information [rt.com#2].</li></ul><blockquote>Everyone reading this guidance cares deeply about the role they play in UK democracy.
