Apple is no longer planning to release an Apple Watch that includes a camera, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-22/apple-plans-glasses-for-2026-as-part-of-ai-push-nixes-watch-with-camera">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple was developing Apple Watch and Apple Watch Ultra models that had a camera to view the wearer's surrounding environment, but work on those projects ended this week.<br/>

The camera in the Apple Watch would not have been used for features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> or snapping photos, but instead would have allowed Apple Watch owners to get information about objects and places near them.<br/>
<br/>
An Apple Watch might have been able to do things like provide hours when pointed at a restaurant or store, identify a plant, describe an object, or offer language translations. The wearable camera functionality would have worked much like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a>, an AI <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> feature that lets users point their camera at something to get more information.<br/>
<br/>
Apple planned to release the camera-equipped Apple Watch models in 2027, but the plans are off. It's possible Apple could bring the technology back in the future, and it's not known why development ended.<br/>

Though Apple is no longer planning for an Apple Watch with a camera, it's still developing AirPods with tiny cameras inside. The AirPods cameras may be infrared sensors to enable features like enhanced spatial audio, in-air gesture control, and AI capabilities.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/apple-watch-with-camera-canceled/">Apple Stops Work on Camera-Equipped Apple Watch Planned for 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-work-on-camera-equipped-apple-watch-planned-for-2027.2457528/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
