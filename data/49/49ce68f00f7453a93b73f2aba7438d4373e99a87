<p>Iranian security and judicial authorities have detained several prominent figures from the Reformists Front after recent protests. Other members were reportedly summoned to prosecutors, and in some cases officials have not publicly disclosed formal charges. Multiple outlets described the detentions as part of a stepped-up crackdown meant to discourage further unrest. At the same time, Iranian and U.S. officials held talks in Oman that both sides described as positive, signaling that nuclear diplomacy is still moving forward even as the domestic crackdown deepens. For international audiences, the contrast is stark: Iran’s leadership is signaling openness to negotiations with the Trump administration while tightening controls at home over dissent and political organizing.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/edszf0vChY1MfpHDBhR5tQiV_iCPugpKILK9D-8_qr5lM2adzpxcOfuc2CBKsaUhSxXrFgVIQXRhjzIt1wxjav3O_HsFliZHMd7L9W9kLKBbHnNLS0IJF2sbWpZ6a86Lz2iLQc7Oy2u8C1QqF_rjsFleus5Q8DLsL3_cap1i8VRzS91AJ6gnKX2mRHrgzHF7haWcC4Zk' alt='Azar Mansouri, center, head of the Reformist Front, reported arrested Sunday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Named detentions: Reuters said authorities arrested Reformists Front figures including Mohsen Aminzadeh, Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, and Azar Mansouri.
