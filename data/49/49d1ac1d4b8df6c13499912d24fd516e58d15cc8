<p id="p2">The <a href="https://www.20k.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twenty Thousand Hertz</a> podcast&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.20k.org/episodes/sonic-accessibility" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest episode</a> celebrates the 40th anniversary of Apple&rsquo;s accessibility efforts. Through a series of interviews with Apple&rsquo;s Sarah Herrlinger, Ron Huang, Deidre Caldbeck, and Erick Treski, host Dallas Taylor explores the history of accessibility features in Apple products. It&rsquo;s an excellent oral history that weaves historical insights and present-day technological advancements in a fascinating way.</p>
<p id="p3">Beyond the tech of it all, though, what really comes through is the importance of the accessibly work that goes into Apple&rsquo;s hardware and <a href="https://www.20k.org/episodes/sonic-accessibility" rel="noopener noreferrer">the impact it has on so many lives</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  [<strong>Dallas Taylor, Show Host:</strong>] For years now, I&rsquo;ve been talking about how hearable technology was eventually gonna combine headphones, earplugs, hearing aids, virtual assistants, and more into one earbud-like device that we can theoretically leave in all day. This is the kind of technology that I&rsquo;m most passionate about because it goes so far beyond just convenience or entertainment. It&rsquo;s the stuff that literally changes people&rsquo;s lives and helps people connect with each other through sound.</p>
<p>  [<strong>Deidre Caldbeck, Apple&rsquo;s senior director of product marketing for Apple Watch and Health</strong>] For me, when I started to work on Apple Watch and then soon after Health, to be able to hear some of these stories we&rsquo;ve been sharing today, I just felt very fortunate that this was my actual job. This is my profession, that I get to work with these brilliant people that come up with these features that anyone can use and anyone has the potential of having their lives changed.</p>
<p>  [<strong>Dallas Taylor, Show Host:</strong>] Now, designing for accessibility comes with a lot of challenges, but when you approach those challenges with empathy and creativity, the result is often a better product for everyone.</p>
<p>  [<strong>Sara Herrlinger, Apple&rsquo;s senior director of global accessibility policy and initiatives:</strong>]: We&rsquo;re all unique in the world, and accessibility features may be life hacks to one person and they may be necessities to another, but we&rsquo;re always just trying to make sure that we have features that work for everyone.
