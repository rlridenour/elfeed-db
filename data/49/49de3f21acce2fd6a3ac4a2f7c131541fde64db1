<p>If these caps were a <em>student project</em> it’d get an F. Who thinks you can print one logo on top of another? They look like mistakes, like caps that got run through the embroidery machine twice. The only good one <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/ashos-cap.jpeg">is for the “ASHOS”</a>, which comes close to the actual word everyone uses for that team of cheaters.</p>

<p><strong>Update, 3pm ET:</strong> It looks like maybe MLB and New Era (the hatmakers) <a href="https://www.mlbshop.com/?query=overlap&amp;_ref=p-HP%3Am-SEARCH">have put the whole lineup of caps out of their misery</a>.</p>
