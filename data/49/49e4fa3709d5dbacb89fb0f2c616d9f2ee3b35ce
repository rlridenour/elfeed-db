Here in the United States it&rsquo;s Thanksgiving and I&rsquo;m celebrating with (part of) my family. Therefore, there will be no Irreal post today except to wish those of you in the US. and elsewhere that Thanksgiving is celebrated a happy Turkey Day. Let&rsquo;s all be grateful for blessings we&rsquo;ve been given and reflect on them.</p>
