<blockquote>
  <p>Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have agreed to give the Trump
administration a portion of the sales from their
artificial-intelligence chips to China, unusual agreements that
deepen their relationships with the U.S. government.</p>

<p>The Trump administration will receive 15% of the sales as part of
a deal to approve exports of Nvidia’s H20 AI chip to China,
according to people familiar with the matter. That could amount
to billions of dollars given demand for the H20 chips and is the
latest example of the White House employing novel tactics to
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/patent-system-overhaul-18e0f06f?mod=article_inline">raise revenue</a>. The administration has reached the same
agreement with AMD for its MI308 chip, the people said. Details
of the arrangements and the financial structures are still being
worked out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are expected to pay the United
States 15 percent of the money they take in from selling
artificial intelligence chips to China, as part of a highly
unusual financial agreement with the Trump administration.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, met with
President Trump at the White House and agreed to give the federal
government its 15 percent cut, essentially making the federal
government a partner in Nvidia’s business in China, said the
people familiar with the deal. The Commerce Department began
granting licenses for A.I. chip sales two days later, these people
said. [...]</p>

<p>There are few precedents for the Commerce Department agreeing to
grant licenses for exports in exchange for a share of revenue. But
the unorthodox payments are consistent with Mr. Trump’s
increasingly interventionist role in international business deals
involving American companies. In June, the administration approved
investment by Nippon Steel, a Japanese company, in U.S. Steel in a
deal that included a so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/business/us-steel-nippon-steel-partnership-deal.html">golden share in the
company</a>, a rarely used practice where the government takes
a stake in a business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Unusual agreements</em> is quite the euphemism for a shakedown. US companies pay the Treasury a share of their revenue all the time, of course. That’s called taxation. But taxes are laws, written by Congress. There’s no tax here. Congress has played zero role whatsoever in these deals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/11/trump-defends-deal-to-sell-nvidia-export-control-license-00503778">CNN, today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Donald Trump defended a deal he struck with Nvidia CEO
Jensen Huang to allow the sale of certain semiconductor chips to
China in exchange for the company giving the U.S. government 15
percent of the revenue.</p>

<p>“I said, ‘I want 20 percent if I’m going to approve this for
you,’” Trump told reporters Monday during a White House press
conference. “For the country, for our country. I don’t want it
myself. … And he said, ‘Would you make it 15?‘ So we negotiate
a little deal.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tell here, revealing just how fucked up <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">this whole thing</a> is getting, is that Trump felt the need to say “For the country, for our country. I don’t want it myself.”</p>
