Zanuck answered &#8220;Fifteen thousand dollars.&#8221; Jones wrote, &#8220;Okay, shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The line, which had been written by an Englishman, was &#8220;I can&#8217;t eat that bloody old box of tunny fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones changed this to &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand this damned old tuna fish.&#8221;</p>
