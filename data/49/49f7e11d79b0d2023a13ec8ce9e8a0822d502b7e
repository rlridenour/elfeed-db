iPhone users with Verizon service were generally unable to make phone calls, send text messages, or use data over 5G or LTE due to the outage.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone users typically see "SOS" in the status bar when a carrier experiences an outage.<br/>
<br/>
Apple explains what "SOS" means in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120000">support document</a>:<blockquote>If you see SOS or "SOS only" in the status bar, your device isn't connected to your cellular network, but you can still make emergency calls through other carrier networks. This feature is available in Australia, Canada, and the United States.</blockquote>Verizon said that customers who are still having an issue should restart their devices to reconnect to the network.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/verizon/">Verizon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/iphone-sos-verizon-apologizes/">iPhone SOS: Verizon Apologizes for Outage, Promises Customer Credits</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-sos-verizon-apologizes-for-outage-promises-customer-credits.2476059/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
