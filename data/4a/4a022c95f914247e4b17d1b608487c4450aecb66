<p>I&#8217;ve updated the membership level names for MacSparky Labs to better reflect what the community has become over time.</p>



<p>The new names are:</p>



<p><strong>Member</strong>&nbsp;(formerly Supporter) &#8211; Being part of MacSparky Labs isn&#8217;t just about supporting the work; it&#8217;s about joining a community of people passionate about productivity and technology.</p>



<p><strong>Insider</strong>&nbsp;(formerly Backstage) &#8211; These members get behind-the-scenes access to my workflow, thinking process, and upcoming projects. &#8220;Insider&#8221; better captures what this level actually provides.</p>



<p><strong>Pathfinder</strong>&nbsp;(formerly Early Access) &#8211; Our most engaged members who help shape the direction of MacSparky Labs. They&#8217;re not just getting early access; they&#8217;re helping determine where we go next.</p>



<p>The original names—Supporter, Backstage, and Early Access—served us well in the beginning, but they felt increasingly transactional as MacSparky Labs evolved into something more collaborative and community-focused.</p>



<p><strong>For existing members:</strong>&nbsp;Nothing else has changed. All features, benefits, and pricing remain exactly the same. These are simply new names that better represent what MacSparky Labs has grown into.</p>
