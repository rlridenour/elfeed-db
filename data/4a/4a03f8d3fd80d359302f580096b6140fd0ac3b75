"I've been unusually reflective lately about Apple because we have been working on what do we do to mark this moment," Cook told employees today, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/apple-s-cook-vows-to-lobby-lawmakers-on-immigration-issue">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. "When you really stop and pause and think about the last 50 years, it makes your heart sing. It really does. I promise some celebration."<br/>
<br/>
Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, so the company will celebrate its 50th anniversary in a little less than two months from now.<br/>
<br/>
From near-bankruptcy in the late 1990s to becoming the world's most valuable public company in the early 2010s, Apple has been through a series of highs and lows over the past half century. The company just reported an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/apple-1q-2026-earnings/">all-time revenue record</a> last quarter, driven by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/iphone-demand-simply-staggering/">all-time high iPhone sales</a>, so the company has come a long way.<br/>
