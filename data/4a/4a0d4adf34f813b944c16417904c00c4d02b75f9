Apple is able to wirelessly update iPhones that are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/what-new-machine-to-update-iphones-looks-like/">still in the box</a> using a proprietary system called "Presto," and now <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/09/exclusive-macos-26-beta-hints-at-sealed-mac-updates-at-apple-stores/">9to5Mac</a></em> claims that the technology is going to be expanded to the Mac.<br/>

With Presto, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> employees can place a sealed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> box on the Presto shelf. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; then turns on, and the software the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is running is updated to the latest available version. The process takes between 15 and 30 minutes, and it allows iPhones be updated to Apple's newest software before being sold to a customer.<br/>
<br/>
There are hints of a similar Presto option for the Mac in the third beta of macOS Tahoe. As with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Macs could be updated to the newest software ahead of when they're sold, which would prevent customers from having to do day-one updates after purchasing a product.<br/>
<br/>
It's not clear how a Presto for Mac feature would work, given that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; version relies on NFC and Macs don't have an NFC chip inside, nor is it known when the functionality could roll out to Apple's retail stores.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/apple-presto-mac-update/">Apple&#039;s &#039;Presto&#039; Wireless Update Tech May Soon Reach the Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-presto-wireless-update-tech-may-soon-reach-the-mac.2461280/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
