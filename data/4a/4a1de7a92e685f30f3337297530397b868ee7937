<p>The US Department of Defense has completed a five‑month review of the AUKUS security pact and formally endorsed plans to supply Australia with at least three Virginia‑class nuclear‑powered attack submarines within about 15 years. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said the review found the agreement aligns with President Trump’s stated &quot;America First&quot; agenda and his guidance that AUKUS should move &quot;full steam ahead&quot;. The decision confirms that the 2021 AUKUS framework, originally agreed under then‑president Joe Biden, will continue largely intact under the current US administration, giving Australia long‑term certainty for its plan to boost long‑range naval capabilities in the Indo‑Pacific. Australian officials say they are meeting key milestones on the project, which is expected to cost Canberra hundreds of billions of dollars over several decades and eventually enable domestic construction of nuclear‑powered submarines. Lawmakers supportive of the pact in Washington welcomed the review’s conclusion, saying it confirms the deal serves US national security interests and has now outlasted multiple changes of government in all three partner countries.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/yg7e6wRKjIBOCSY_yVn_qaF3zD5jnxvKFiwRuEbAAWa8KUmyaPfFjAtCf1OSWwZIPX_PFCMKtjXZZW8GT9FU6o4hp8adkql96SkTIU2RsUMV' alt='The Pentagon building in Washington, DC, where the AUKUS submarine review was completed.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>America First framing: The Pentagon review explicitly states that AUKUS is &quot;in alignment with President Trump&#x27;s America First agenda,&quot; framing the Indo‑Pacific submarine cooperation as consistent with the administration&#x27;s broader strategic and industrial priorities.</li><li>Industrial benefits: US congressman Joe Courtney, whose Connecticut district hosts the primary American submarine manufacturing facility, highlighted that the review’s endorsement helps underpin long‑term demand and planning for the US shipbuilding workforce and supply chain.</li><li>Australian cost estimate: Australian estimates suggest the AUKUS submarine program could require up to about 235 billion Australian dollars in spending over roughly three decades, covering US and UK boats as well as development of Australia’s own build capability.</li><li>Strategic purpose: Canberra views the future nuclear‑powered fleet as central to improving its ability to conduct long‑range strike and deterrence operations across the Pacific, particularly in light of China’s growing naval presence in the region.</li><li>Technology cooperation: Beyond the submarines themselves, AUKUS includes plans for the three countries to collaborate on a wider set of advanced military technologies, such as undersea warfare capabilities and other emerging systems, as part of a long‑term strategic partnership.</li></ul><blockquote>With its completion, it is important to note that the 2021 AUKUS agreement has now survived three changes of government in all three nations and still stands strong. - Congressman Joe Courtney</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Department of Defense: The Pentagon says the internal review &quot;fully endorses&quot; the AUKUS framework and identifies ways to put the pact on the &quot;strongest possible footing,&quot; signalling clear institutional backing for the submarine transfer and broader technology cooperation.
