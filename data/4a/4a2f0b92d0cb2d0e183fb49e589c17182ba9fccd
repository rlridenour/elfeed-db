<p>Today is 2025-12-02, and in four days, <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2025/talks/">2025-12-06, EmacsConf will happen!</a></p>

<p><a href="https://emacsconf.org/2025/talks/zettelkasten/">My talk will be “Zettelkasten for Regular Emacs Hackers”</a> (I already uploaded some ‘attachments’, but: <em>Spoiler Warning</em>!), for which my pitch is: you need to create your own thinking environment, because that’s absolutely not a solved, copyable problem, but a deeply personal one.</p>

<p>So enter Emacs as the most moldable of all environments:</p>

<p>There’s this one thing you can do with your Emacs that is not chiefly a technological problem to solve: thinking through writing.</p>

<p>Emacs offers a malleable environment where you can tweak every key stroke, and every pixel on screen to your needs.</p>

<p>Since we’re all here at EmacsConf, the intention is clear: to use and enjoy Emacs, and spend our lives in this amazing environment.</p>

<p>While it’s easy to ditch modern UI conveniences and pull technology like email, chat, database and server management, and editing book drafts into Emacs – well, these are tasks that have been implemented, for which there exist alternatives, and which you can teach Emacs to do in a similar way.</p>

<p>Oversimplifying: we can copy and tweak existing solutions and have a good life.</p>

<p>Now while everyone’s email needs to use the same protocol, everyone’s approach to thinking is different. There’s no cookie cutter solution to merely rewrite in Emacs Lisp. We all need to figure out how to do this on our own, and then find an implementation that suits our needs. (Including using paper, but we’re not talking about paper here.)</p>

<p><strong>This is where I want to show you one simple foundational method to deep thinking, understanding, and problem solving:</strong> create yourself a Zettelkasten, an environment of linked notes that scales well over decades, so that you can take it with you into retirement and beyond for a lifelong journey of learning.</p>

<p>For this presentation, I merely assume that you agree that writing improves the quality and depth of thought. I also assume that you know how to type and move around in Emacs. The rest is just convention, and we’ll walk through a couple of examples and exercises together so that after this talk, you’re equipped with the simple tools that help you unlock new insights in your future.</p>
