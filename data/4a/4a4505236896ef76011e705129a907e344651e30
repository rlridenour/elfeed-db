First, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/">announced</a> that the boarding passes now support Live Activities, so you can keep track of a flight at a glance on your iPhone's Lock Screen. This functionality was already available with the Flighty app, but now you can view a flight's arrival time and more on the Lock Screen if you use Apple's built-in Wallet app.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the Wallet app now displays relevant information below the boarding pass, such as Apple Maps directions to the appropriate airport terminal, a shortcut to the Find My app's newer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/ios-18-2-find-my-share-item-location/">baggage tracking feature</a>, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The first iOS 26 developer beta is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-ios-26-developer-beta/">now available</a>, with a public beta to follow next month. The update will be released later this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/">Apple Wallet</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-enhances-boarding-passes/">Here&#039;s How iOS 26 Enhances Boarding Passes on Your iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-how-ios-26-enhances-boarding-passes-on-your-iphone.2458513/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
