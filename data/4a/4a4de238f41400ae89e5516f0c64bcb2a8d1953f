Apple is preparing to launch a dramatically thinner iPhone this September, and if recent leaks are anything to go by, the so-called iPhone 17 Air could boast one of the most radical design shifts in recent years.<br/>

At just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/iphone-17-air-2mm-thinner/">5.5mm thick</a> (excluding a slightly raised camera bump), the 6.6-inch iPhone 17 Air is expected to become the slimmest iPhone in the lineup by some margin. For comparison, the current iPhone 16 Pro measures 8.25mm thick.<br/>
<br/>
Achieving this level of thinness is unlikely to come without compromise. Dummy models shared by <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut7K73umk9k">AppleTrack</a></em> suggest that Apple has made some subtle adjustments to accommodate internal components in the tighter chassis. Most notably, the USB-C port on the bottom edge is no longer centered front-to-back. Instead, it appears shifted closer to the rear of the device, which is likely to accommodate display components within the enclosure.<br/>
<br/>
There are other signs of Apple's re-engineering efforts. The speaker grilles, for example, show a pared-back design, with only two holes on either side of the port compared to the typical five. That reduction reflects the same space-saving measures required to fit in a battery, processor, display components, and speakers within a much slimmer frame.<br/>

To save even more space, Apple is said to be equipping the iPhone 17 Air with a single rear camera. The company is also expected to remove the physical SIM card slot entirely, adopting eSIM-only support globally – a shift first seen in U.S. iPhones with the iPhone 14.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most interesting internal changes is the inclusion of Apple's new custom-designed C1 modem, first introduced in the iPhone 16e. The ultra-efficient chip should play a big role in maintaining battery life in such a thin frame. Despite its size, sources suggest the iPhone 17 Air will offer battery performance <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/">on par with current iPhone models</a>.<br/>

Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 series during its usual fall event, which may also see the debut of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/18/airpods-pro-3-upgrades-worth-waiting-for/">third-generation AirPods Pro</a>.<br/>
