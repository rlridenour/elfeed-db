<p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump’s son‑in‑law Jared Kushner met Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin for nearly five hours to discuss a revised American plan to end the war in Ukraine, but both sides said they failed to reach a compromise on key territorial issues. The Kremlin described the discussions as useful, constructive and substantive, and confirmed that some elements of Washington’s proposals are acceptable to Moscow while others remain unacceptable. Russian aide Yuri Ushakov said there is still “no compromise version” of a settlement and that the two sides are neither closer nor further from resolving the crisis, while the U.S. delegation handed over several additional documents on the peace plan for further study. The meetings took place as Russian forces claim battlefield momentum and as Europe and Ukraine press for changes to the U.S. draft that would avoid locking in Russian territorial gains, sparking sharp criticism from Putin, who accuses European governments of sabotaging the peace process.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8lENUW8a9BA6dE5ri8Gv2aeC-x3LNMBQCIoC73IgjM2dJzUByaHknJvXMixNWxtl8xc3wc8FHC4P_RbiWONpNvtp2USOFtnNk_my2wECwzhX_0l_ny6xJpefPrhtiQaKQZTf1BNctw7yELyPPQflvFcYRWCY8Nw6bMcAtaP6JygJiCZnCHDB-qzV2ddFxF4Wd2Kw8ANj93rEYls6yWty2H822IPToMHIEsM8qOZZTTXFDu7w4Ne-Uyw6gA' alt='US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner meet President Vladimir Putin and senior Russian officials at the Kremlin during late‑night Ukraine peace talks.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Territory stalemate: Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said territorial questions over Russian‑occupied Ukrainian regions remain the main obstacle, stressing that Moscow will not accept proposals it sees as forcing it to give up land it has claimed.</li><li>US peace blueprint: Washington has circulated a roughly 28‑point draft peace plan that was later watered down to address objections from Kyiv and European capitals that it leaned too far toward Russia’s initial demands.</li><li>Additional documents: During the Kremlin meeting, the US side submitted four further documents detailing possible arrangements for a Ukraine settlement, which Russian officials said they will examine in follow‑up work.</li><li>Putin’s Europe warning: Before seeing the US envoys, Putin told an economic forum that Russia is not seeking conflict but is &quot;ready right now&quot; if Europe starts a war, and claimed European leaders have &quot;no peaceful agenda.&quot;</li><li>Ukraine’s conditions: President Volodymyr Zelensky said any deal must provide a durable end to the war rather than a temporary pause and insisted that no arrangement should be negotiated &quot;behind Ukraine’s back.&quot;</li></ul><blockquote>Definitely not further. - Yuri Ushakov</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Russian government: Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov called the talks &quot;very useful&quot; and &quot;constructive&quot; but emphasized that there is still &quot;a lot of work&quot; to transform US ideas into a version Russia can accept, especially on territorial questions..
