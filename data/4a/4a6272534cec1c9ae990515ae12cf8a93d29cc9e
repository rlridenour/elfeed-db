All of the iPhone 17 models coming later this year will feature two display upgrades, according to information shared by <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PzXoq0A3V">Digital Chat Station</a>, an account with more than three million followers on Chinese social media platform Weibo.<br/>

First, the account said that the entire iPhone 17 series <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/iphone-17-and-17-air-thinner-bezels-rumor/">will feature thinner bezels</a>. Apple says the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max feature the thinnest bezels around the screen of any product it has ever released, and those ultra-thin bezels should now expand from the Pro models to the lower-end iPhone 17 and "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/iphone-17-air-list-of-17-rumored-features/">iPhone 17 Air</a>" models.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the account said that the iPhone 17 models will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/iphone-17-new-dynamic-island-ui-rumor/">new Dynamic Island user interface</a>, but they did not elaborate. It may be that, on the software side, iOS 26 introduces a redesigned Dynamic Island exclusively on all iPhone 17 models. On the hardware side, a smaller Dynamic Island cutout has been rumored, but rumors have conflicted about whether it will debut <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">on the iPhone 17 models</a> this year or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/iphone-18-pro-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/">on the iPhone 18 models</a> next year.<br/>
<br/>
Digital Chat Station has accurately leaked some information regarding future Apple products in the past, but these are still just rumors for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will unveil the iPhone 17 series in September, so we will learn more about these rumored changes and more in less than two months from now.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/19/iphone-17-displays-two-upgrades/">Apple to Upgrade iPhone 17 Displays in These Two Ways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-upgrade-iphone-17-displays-in-these-two-ways.2461816/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
