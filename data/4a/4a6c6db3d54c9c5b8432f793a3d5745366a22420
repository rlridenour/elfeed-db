<a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13349">I&rsquo;ve written before about Álvaro Ramírez&rsquo;s time-zones app</a>. It&rsquo;s sort of like the builtin Emacs app <code>world-clock</code> but easier to configure and you can move the times forward and backward, which is useful for setting up remote meetings in several locations.

Now, in the latest video in his Bending Emacs series, <a href="https://xenodium.com/bending-emacs-episode-9-world-times">Ramírez talks about the time-zones app and gives a demonstration of it</a>. It&rsquo;s a really nice app and although I no longer have to set up remote meetings, I <i>do</i> find it useful to know what time it is in various places in the world. Even relatively obscure places like Shawnee, KS pop right up without a problem.

You can turn on extra details to see things like the number of hours different from your home location, which is, of course, easily settable.

I downloaded the app before I started to write this post and it couldn&rsquo;t be easier. There&rsquo;s no configuration necessary and it works just like in the video. As I said in my original post about time-zones, these days a world clock is no longer an oddity but a necessity.

The video is only 6 minutes, 31 seconds so it&rsquo;s easy to fit in. Take a look and I&rsquo;m sure that you, like me, will download a copy.</p>
