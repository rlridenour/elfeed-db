The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has seemingly confirmed Apple's work on an updated version of the Vision Pro headset.<br/>

One of several documents the FCC shared today references an Apple-designed "Head Mounted Device" with a model number of A3416. An included image confirms the device is a Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The FCC's uploads are transmission tests, SAR test reports, and WLAN test reports, so there's not a lot of additional product information available. We do know that the next Vision Pro will continue to have Wi-Fi 6, as there's no sign of 6GHz Wi-Fi in the testing that the FCC did. <br/>

According to rumors, Apple is working on a refreshed version of the Vision Pro that has a faster M5 chip. The headset isn't expected to feature design updates, with Apple simply updating the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip to a newer, more capable M-series chip. The updated Vision Pro could launch before the end of the year, and it will likely continue to be priced at &#36;3,499.<br/>
<br/>
The FCC's files include a confidentiality request from Apple, but the documents were published anyway. The FCC <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/30/fcc-leaks-macbook-pro-and-more/">also shared documents</a> that hint at future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models.<br/>

A slimmed-down "Vision Air" is in development too, but we aren't expecting that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/02/vision-air-2027/">until 2027</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/30/fcc-apple-vision-pro/">FCC Accidentally Leaks Apple&#039;s Next Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fcc-accidentally-leaks-apples-next-vision-pro.2468045/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
