<p>The US Department of Homeland Security has begun a major immigration operation in the New Orleans area, sending federal agents into Louisiana’s largest city and nearby suburbs to arrest people the agency says are in the country without legal status and accused of violent crimes. Masked officers in marked and unmarked vehicles were seen patrolling a heavily Hispanic/Latino suburb and detaining several men outside a home improvement store in Kenner on Wednesday. Officials describe New Orleans as the latest focus of President Trump’s nationwide deportation push, which has already brought similar raids to a series of other US cities over recent months. Local leaders in this Democratic-run city have raised concerns about the scale of the operation, its tactics, and possible civil rights implications, while immigrant communities report heightened fear and uncertainty as arrests begin.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/HbSL_biEy2awCYFkAjDceUZVvPWPqzpo92VhqqOuUBjV1bXM15h3w89HetH4zj-m89T7N1Aooa_vfinHQRrwD6l8oZ5IzUDVjd3eGBGYl8_eFtQ2027nTPxGBrBBlYvX5Y_MGSEOB1bpKq2PtQOhtZcdxb8ctwHTgHQSEltjOXMfjP0jFh3V5ZOZit58zwVlzcMlVzkZ0L6v5qK8uJtsVv2duMjn3cdRLfiC2s2UOK8sxRj6dJtiFB65ibzh2x5BVdKf_m6olukJ0Yn1hQ' alt='US Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino arrives at a Home Depot in Kenner, Louisiana, as federal agents conduct immigration arrests in the New Orleans area.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Operation framing: Homeland Security officials have publicly framed the New Orleans operation as an effort to “remove the worst of the worst,” indicating a stated focus on people accused of serious violent offenses rather than all undocumented residents.</li><li>Visible patrols: Residents reported seeing teams of masked agents circulating for hours in a largely Hispanic suburb, using both clearly marked federal vehicles and unmarked cars as they moved through neighborhoods.</li><li>French Quarter presence: Border patrol chief Gregory Bovino, a leading figure in the broader deportation campaign, was photographed patrolling New Orleans’ French Quarter as part of the city-wide presence of federal officers.</li><li>Target selection: Federal authorities have said they are using lists of individuals flagged in immigration and law-enforcement databases, concentrating their teams on locations where those people are believed to live or work.</li><li>Local unease: City and parish officials in the New Orleans area have voiced unease about not being fully briefed on operational details, saying they are worried about the possible impact on community trust and cooperation with local law enforcement.</li></ul><blockquote>Remove the worst of the worst from New Orleans - US Department of Homeland Security statement</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Department of Homeland Security: DHS portrays the New Orleans raids as a public-safety operation aimed at apprehending immigrants accused of serious violent crimes and stresses that the agency is concentrating resources on those cases.
