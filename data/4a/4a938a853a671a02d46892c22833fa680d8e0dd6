<p>In an <a href="https://www.caut.ca/latest/2025/04/caut-advises-academics-against-non-essential-travel-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overview</a> of the warning, CAUT says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Given the rapidly evolving political landscape in the United States and reports of individuals encountering difficulties crossing the border, CAUT strongly recommends that academic staff travel to the U.S. only if essential and necessary.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>In addition, CAUT recommends that academics who fall into the following categories exercise particular caution:</em></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em>Citizens or residents of a country identified in media reports as likely to be subject to a travel ban</em></li>
<li><em>Citizens or residents of a country where there are diplomatic tensions with the U.S.</em></li>
<li><em>Travellers with passport stamps evidencing recent travel to countries that may be subject to a travel ban or where there are diplomatic tensions with the U.S.</em></li>
<li><em>Those who have expressed negative opinions about the current U.S. administration or its policies</em></li>
<li><em>Those whose research could be seen as being at odds with the position of the current U.S. administration</em></li>
<li><em>Travellers who identify as transgender or whose travel documents indicate a sex other than their sex assigned at birth</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Academics should carefully consider what information they have, or need to have, on their electronic devices when crossing borders and take actions to protect sensitive information where necessary.</em></p>
