<p>&#8220;I found myself &#8230; haunted by &#8216;The Darkling Thrush,'&#8221; <a href="http://jacketmagazine.com/18/dolin-r-rabin.html">she said</a>, &#8220;by its tone of millennial mourning, by its note of hope in the thrush&#8217;s song, and most especially by its opening line which situates the poet at he meditates on the passing century: &#8216;I leant upon a coppice gate.'&#8221;</p>
