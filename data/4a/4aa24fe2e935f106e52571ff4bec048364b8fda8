<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To celebrate the start of WWDC, Apple will also host an in-person
experience on June 9 that will provide developers with the
opportunity to watch the Keynote and Platforms State of the Union
at Apple Park, meet with Apple experts one-on-one and in group
labs, and take part in special activities. Space will be limited;
details on how to apply to attend can be found on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/">WWDC25
website</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right on time: in recent years, WWDC dates have been announced on:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>and now today, Tuesday 25 March 2025. Last Tuesday in March <em>next year</em> is March 31 — that’s my guess for next year’s announcement.</p>

<p>And, yes, the “25” in the logo <a href="https://x.com/parkerortolani/status/1904581636760428734">has a decidedly glassy look and some animation that’s just plain fun</a>.</p>
