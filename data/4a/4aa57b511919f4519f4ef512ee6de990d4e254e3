Apple today updated its iWork apps <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/-/id361285480">Keynote</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/-/id361304891">Numbers</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/-/id361309726">Pages</a> with new features that require iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, or macOS 15.4.<br/>

For example, in the latest version of each app, you can now make text edits using Writing Tools directly in a presentation, spreadsheet, or document. This feature requires Apple Intelligence, which is available on iPhone 15 Pro models, all iPhone 16 models, any Mac or iPad model with an M1 chip or newer, or the iPad mini with the A17 Pro chip.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, Apple says you can now export a presentation, spreadsheet, or document in another format using the Shortcuts app, and all three apps gained improved copy and paste integration with the Freeform app. Each app also received a few other enhancements that are not tied to the latest software updates.<br/>
<br/>
