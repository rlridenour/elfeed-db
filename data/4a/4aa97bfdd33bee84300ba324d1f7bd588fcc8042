Hornsby is a suburb of Sydney, on the Upper North Shore. Apple opened its store there in 2011, and it will close for good on October 4, at 5 p.m. local time.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement shared with some Australian media outlets a few months ago, Apple said it had decided not to renew its lease at Westfield Hornsby. Apple said all affected retail employees would be given the opportunity to work at Apple's nearby store <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/chatswoodchase/">at the Chatswood Chase shopping mall</a>, in Chatswood, which is set to reopen in October.<br/>

Apple Chatswood Chase has been closed for renovations for many months. Apple said the store will be completely redesigned, and it will offer an Apple Pickup station for collecting online orders, and a dedicated area for Today at Apple sessions. With the Chatswood Chase store set to expand, Apple decided to close its Hornsby store.<br/>
<br/>
The company has six other stores in the Sydney area.<br/>
