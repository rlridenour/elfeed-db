<p>Cultural groups across the country received notices yesterday of the abrupt cancellation of their National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grants, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/arts/humanities-grants-canceled-doge.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, and according to other sources, some individual grant recipients, including philosophers, have had their NEH grants terminated.<span id="more-53296"></span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nhalliance.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Alliance for the Humanities</a> has been warning that the Trump administration&#8217;s &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221; (DOGE) was coming for the NEH and released a <a href="https://nhalliance.org/nha-statement-neh-doge-threats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> in its defense, which various organizations, including the American Philosophical Association, signed onto. The Alliance also has been calling for people to contact their officials&#8212;something they made it very easy to do with <a href="https://p2a.co/DdtlGIT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this online form</a>.</p>
<p>The recent cuts included, according the the NYT, the &#8220;blanket cancellation of funding for humanities councils in 56 states and jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>More cuts are on the way, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/arts/trump-doge-federal-cuts-humanities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports the NYT</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>[M]anagers told staff members that DOGE had recommended reductions in staff of as much as 70 to 80 percent (of approximately 180 people), as well as what could amount to a cancellation of all grants made under the Biden administration that have not been fully paid out.</em></p>
<p>It is likely we will be hearing from more of our <a href="https://dailynous.com/tag/national-endowment-for-the-humanities-neh/">recent NEH grant winning colleagues</a> that their grants have been suspended or rescinded.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Below is a redacted letter sent to an academic researcher whose grant was cancelled.</p>
