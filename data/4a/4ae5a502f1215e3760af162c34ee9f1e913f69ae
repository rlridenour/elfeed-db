<p>After searching around on Reddit yesterday, I found a reference to one of my old blog posts and reposted it on my current blog: <a href="https://taonaw.com/2022/10/30/of-tiddlywiki-emacs-and-digital.html">Of TiddlyWiki, Emacs, and Digital Gardens</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/09/26/i-want-to-help-explain.html">considering writing Micro.blog explanations and instructions</a> again for the last two days, and the thought process led me to my wiki, which is still linked from my About section. The wiki is how I wrote about Micro.blog in the past, as I was learning how to use it (again, here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://taonaw.gitlab.io/taonah/#Micro.blog">Micro.blog section</a> in my wiki).</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d notice there&rsquo;s an index to the right with a search option, and that the content titled &ldquo;Micro.blog&rdquo; opens in a segment surrounded by a narrow red border, which contains a an additional topics section at the bottom, which you can also open from the main index to the right if you select and expend <strong>Micro.blog</strong> there. This, in a nutshell, is why TiddlyWiki is ideal for this sort of documentation.</p>
<p>It makes sense to go back to the wiki if I want to write technical workflows that people can read, because it&rsquo;s more suited for the task than blog posts. The topics are sorted by category, not date, and the interlinking system is designed to consume knowledge in a dynamic way that I can&rsquo;t do on a blog<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But the real issue doesn&rsquo;t lie with where to put this information; that answer has been in my head. The problem is the time and energy, which I already talked about several times. Emacs and org-mode have been the way to go for a long time, and that&rsquo;s not going to change. When I learn something, it goes in Emacs, because nothing can beat the speed I get out of those. Writing a draft in TiddlyWiki is <em>painful</em> compared to writing something inside Emacs.</p>
<p>The obvious solution is exporting from org-mode to TiddlyWiki, and this is also the heart of the problem. There&rsquo;s no direct way to do that, really.</p>
<p>There are some packages to use (I believe the last one I used was <a href="https://github.com/mwfogleman/tid-mode">tid-mode</a>), but these are all several years old and come with some issues. TiddlyWiki is sophisticated and uses its own syntax; some of the more advanced functions require typing in directly. If you&rsquo;re familiar with markdown and HTML, you&rsquo;d know that markdown covers about 90% of what you need, but every now and then, you just have to go in there and enter some HTML code directly. It&rsquo;s a similar concept.</p>
<p>Combine that with editing, ensuring that everything fits visually on a browser, committing and pushing changes to GitLab (which is where I have it hosted), and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a level of friction that slows you down and requires time. As much as I&rsquo;d love spending a good hour or two a day writing these things (I enjoy it, believe it or not), I just don&rsquo;t have that. Even if I get some dead time at work to do something, I have to be on standby almost all the time, and emergencies that pull me away from whatever I was doing happen constantly. This is something I can deal with when I write a blog post, which has a rather simple process, but it&rsquo;s harder to do when you work with TiddlyWiki, Emacs, and  Images (because I have a lot of visuals to support the documentation).</p>
<p>At the end of the day this is all just whining. I need to just start. Yeah yeah, I know.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p><sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup>: Emacs users would read this and ask why not just convert to HTML? Well I did that, and even better: I can upload my org files directly to GitLab. It supports the syntax and it&rsquo;s nice to read, images included. With Denote, it&rsquo;s even better, as I can include indexes (called dynamic blocks) inside my files. This is something I <a href="https://taonaw.com/2024/01/04/denote-and-orgmode.html">discussed</a> in the past. But as nice as this is, it&rsquo;s still not as good as the wiki for consumption for non-technical users who don&rsquo;t visit GitLab regularly. The abilities that come with TiddlyWiki make it on a level of a published book or a manual, something I believe you can only fully understand if you experience it yourself.</p>
