First, Apple says the new 14-inch MacBook Pro offers up to 2× faster SSD performance than the equivalent previous-generation model, so read and write speeds should get a significant boost. Apple says it is using "the latest storage technology," but it did not provide any further details, and there are no SSD benchmark results yet.<br/>
<br/>
Second, Apple says the 14-inch MacBook Pro base model can now be configured with up to 4TB of storage, whereas the highest storage capacity offered for the equivalent previous-generation model was 2TB. However, the highest-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Max chips can be configured with up to 8TB of storage.<br/>

The new 14-inch MacBook Pro can be pre-ordered now, and it launches Wednesday, October 22. In the U.S., pricing for this model continues to start at &#36;1,599.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/new-14-inch-macbook-pro-two-key-upgrades/">New 14-Inch MacBook Pro Has Two Key Upgrades Beyond the M5 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-14-inch-macbook-pro-has-two-key-upgrades-beyond-the-m5-chip.2469240/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
