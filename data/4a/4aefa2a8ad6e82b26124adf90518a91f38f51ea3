<li>A magnesium complex with three types of mag: Glycinate, Malate, and Taurate</li>
<li>OR: a honey-lemon-flavored drink powder (Magnesium Glycinate + a little Vitamin D)</li>
<li>Either way, it’s 120 servings</li>
<li>Best by November 2026 - November 2027</li>
<li>Are they Mac Compatible: You don’t need any magnesium to put your computer to sleep</li>
</ul><h1>Lay Down</h1><p>At the bottom of every supplement product page, you find a disclaimer like such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, this lack of FDA regulation does not inspire supplement companies to police themselves. Instead, they make bold claims, protecting themselves by keeping their promises broad.</p>
<p>Case in point, from the complex we have today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Magnesium Complex supports strong bones, a healthy immune system, &amp; optimal absorption, which makes it an ideal addition to your daily routine for optimal wellness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from the powder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We use the highly bioavailable form of vegan magnesium glycinate powder for sleep providing higher solubility and rapid absorption in the gut to deliver enhanced benefits</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the total lack of measurable outcomes. No guarantee of a lowered heart rate during stressful times. No promise of eight hours of good sleep. The bones? They’re, you know, strong or whatever. The immune system? It’s totally, like, healthy and stuff.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the central question whenever we sell supplements: Does it actually work?</p>
<p>The answer here seems to be: Maybe?</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/does-magnesium-help-you-sleep">Cleveland Clinic’s integrative medicine specialist Naoki Umeda, MD</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Magnesium may help regulate neurotransmitters that are directly related to sleep.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds great, right? Furthermore, some studies have shown it to make falling asleep easier, improve sleep quality, and even reduce restless leg syndrome. The only issue? The scope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The studies on sleep and magnesium were all small studies, and the evidence is thin,” Dr. Umeda clarifies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bummer.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: maybe taking a magnesium supplement improves your immune system and/or puts you straight to bed. Or maybe it doesn’t. But also, maybe it’s symbolic of establishing healthier habits and/or better sleep hygiene. Maybe you pay closer attention to your body, or put your phone away an hour or two before lights out, because you have that reminder.</p>
<p>Or maybe it doesn’t help at all: it doesn’t make you feel better or inspire better choices.</p>
<p>Even if that’s the case, hey, at least you got it from us for just $24, right?</p>
