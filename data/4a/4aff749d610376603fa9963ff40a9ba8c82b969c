<p id="p2">Today we&rsquo;re publishing the <a href="https://appstories.net/plans" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStories+</a> post-show for all <a href="https://appstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStories</a> listeners to enjoy for free.</p>

<p id="p4">This week&rsquo;s subscriber-only post-show is all about <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-breach-of-trust-apple-held-in-contempt-over-app-store-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the contempt order entered against Apple</a> last week. In a world or tech litigation where Google and Meta are at risk of being broken up, the contempt order entered against Apple may seem inconsequential. However, the reality is much different.</p>
<p id="p5">In the post-show, I walk listeners through what this sort of high-stakes litigation is like and pinpoint the critical mistakes Apple made in complying with Judge Gonzalez Rodgers&rsquo; order. It&rsquo;s a fascinating story of hubris, miscalculation, and the critical difference between assumptions and facts. It&rsquo;s also a decision that will <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/developers-and-platforms-react-as-app-store-rules-change-in-the-u-s/" rel="noopener noreferrer">change the App Store in the U.S.</a> and perhaps worldwide.</p>
<p id="p6">Today also marks the beginning of our annual OS wish list episodes of AppStories, which we kick off with our iOS and iPadOS 19 wishes. Each week until WWDC, Federico and I will be detailing what we&rsquo;ll be looking for at Apple&rsquo;s annual developer conference.</p>
<p id="p7">We hope AppStories listeners enjoy the extended bonus this week. As many readers and listeners are probably aware, the ad market for podcasts and websites is in an extended period of decline, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s ever coming back to where it once was. As a result, we rely on listener support more than ever. AppStories has been around since 2017, and we want to continue producing the show long into the future.</p>
