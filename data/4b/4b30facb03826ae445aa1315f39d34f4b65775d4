The Logitech Muse is a spatially-tracked stylus developed for use with the ‌Vision Pro‌. It was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/logitech-announces-two-new-accessories/">announced at WWDC</a> earlier this year. The Muse is intended to support the next generation of spatial computing workflows enabled by visionOS 26. The device incorporates six degrees of freedom (6DoF) tracking, pressure-sensitive tips, and real-time haptic feedback to allow users to interact with digital environments through precise input and tactile realism.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Logitech Muse is a spatial accessory designed to enhance the way you work, create, and collaborate with Apple Vision Pro. Muse combines a familiar form factor with advanced technology, offering a precise, immersive workflow in both productivity and creativity apps.<br/>
<br/>
Seamless motion tracking in six degrees of freedom with intuitive controls allows you to draw, annotate, and interact naturally in space. Real-time haptic responses add textural realism to create a truly engaging experience. A pressure-sensitive tip and force-sensing button allow you to vary line thickness whether drawing on a surface or in the air.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
According to Logitech, Muse is intended for use across a wide range of spatial computing applications, including 3D design, collaborative workspaces, and immersive visualization tools. The device features both physical buttons and gesture controls. The Logitech Muse costs &#36;129.95 and is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HS9U2ZM/A/logitech-muse">now available from Apple</a>. <br/>
