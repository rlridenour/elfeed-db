 
          <p>The end of the start of another year has ended. So now all there is left to do is to look forward to the end of the next month, starting effective immediately, and of course ending after the end of the end we are going to look forward to. Quite the end-eavour. I guess I&rsquo;ll end these ramblings by ending this paragraph. But not before this message of general interest: children can be very end-earing, but sometimes you also want to end their endless whining! <em>Fin.</em></p>
<p>Previous month: <a href="/post/2026/02/january-2026/">January 2026</a>.</p>

<p>Is <a href="/tags/emacs">Emacs</a> a game? I think it is. I spent every precious free minute of my time tinkering with my configuration, exploring and discovering all the weird and cool stuff the editor and the thousands of community-provided packages offer. You can tell when you&rsquo;ve joined the cult when you&rsquo;re exchanging emails with random internet strangers about obscure Elisp functions and even joining the sporadic &ldquo;let&rsquo;s share Emacs learnings!&rdquo; video calls (thanks <a href="https://site.sebasmonia.com/">Seb</a>).</p>
<p>Does receiving pre-ordered games count as <em>played</em>? I removed the shrink wrap from <em>Ruffy</em> and my calendar tells me I should start ordering <em>UFO 50</em> very very soon via <code>fangamer.eu</code>. Now if only that stupid Emacs config would stabilise; perhaps then I could pick up the Switch again&hellip; The intention was to start learning Clojure but I somehow got distracted after learning the Emacs CIDER REPL is the one you want.</p>
<h2 id="selected-blog-posts">Selected (blog) posts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nathan Rooy created a very cool <a href="https://nry.me/posts/2025-10-09/small-web-screenshots/">One million (small web) screnshots</a> project and explains the technicalities behind it. Browsing to find your blog (mine are in there!) is really cool. It&rsquo;s also funny to discover the GenAI purple-slop-blob. <em>Brain Baking</em> is located just north of a small dark green lake of expired domain name screenshots. <em>Jefklak&rsquo;s Codex</em>, being much more colourful, is located at the far edge, to the right of a small Spaceship-domain-shark lake:</li>

<li>Shom Bandopadhaya helped me regain my sanity with the Emacs undo philosophy. <a href="https://shom.dev/posts/20250622_undo-finally-clicked-with-vundo/">Install vundo.</a> Done.</li>
<li>Related: Sacha Chua was writing and <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/06/thinking-about-time-travel-with-the-emacs-text-editor-and-org-mode/">thinking about time travel with Emacs, Org mode, and backups</a>. I promise there&rsquo;ll be non-Emacs related links in here, somewhere! Keep on digging!</li>
<li>Michael Klamerus reminded me the <a href="https://virtualmoose.org/2026/01/01/biomenace-remastered-thoughts/">BioMenace remaster</a> is already out there. I loved that game as a kid but couldn&rsquo;t get past level 3 or 4. It&rsquo;s known to be extremely difficult. Or I am known to be a noob.</li>
<li>Lars Ingebrigtsen combats link rot with <a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2025/02/20/wordpress-link-rot-tweak/">taking screenshots of external links</a>. I wrote <a href="/post/2024/12/how-bad-is-link-rot-at-brain-baking/">about link rot</a> a while ago and I must say that&rsquo;s a genius addition. On hover, a small screenshot appears to permanently frame the thing you&rsquo;re pointing to. I need to think about implementing this myself.</li>
<li>Seb pointed me towards Karthinks&rsquo; <a href="https://karthinks.com/software/emacs-window-management-almanac/">Emacs window management almanac</a>, a wall of text I will have to re-read a couple of times. I did manage to write a few simple window management helper functions that primarily do stuff with only a 2-split, which is good enough.</li>
<li>Mikko shared his <a href="https://mikkosgameblog.com/2026/01/gaming-year-2025/">Board Gaming Year recap of 2025</a>. <em>Forest Shuffle</em> reaching 500 plays is simply insane, even if you take out the BoardGameArena numbers.</li>
<li>Alex Harri spent a lot of time building an <a href="https://alexharri.com/blog/ascii-rendering">image-to-ASCII renderer</a> and explains how the project was approached.</li>
<li>This Precondition <a href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods">Guide to Home Row Mods</a> is really cool and with Karabiner Elements in MacOS totally possible. It will get messy once you start fiddling with the timing.</li>
<li>Elsa Gonsiorowski wrote about <a href="https://www.gonsie.com/blorg/delete-v-kill.html">Emacs Delete vs. Kill</a> which again helped me build a proper mental state of what the hell is going on in this Alien editor.</li>
<li>Matt Might shared <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/">shell scripts to improve your academic writing</a> by simply scanning the text for so-called &ldquo;weasel words&rdquo;.  Bad: <em>We used various methods to isolate four samples</em> Better: <em>We isolated four samples</em>. I must say, academic prose sure could use this script.</li>
<li>Robert Lützner discovered <code>jj</code> and <a href="https://www.schafe-sind-bessere-rasenmaeher.de/tech/why-i-prefer-jujutsu-over-git/">prefers it over Git</a>. I&rsquo;m interested in its interoperability with Git.</li>
<li>Charles Choi <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/tuning-emacs-to-write-prose-in-org-and-markdown.html">tuned Emacs to write prose</a> by modifying quite a few settings I have yet to dig into.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-random-links">Other random links</h2>
<ul>
<li>A friend installed <a href="https://www.pivpn.io/">PiVPN</a> recently. I hadn&rsquo;t heard from that one just yet so perhaps it&rsquo;s worth a mention here.</li>
<li>KeepassXC is getting on my nerves. Perhaps I should simply use <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>, the standard unix password manager. But it should also be usable by my wife so&hellip; Nah.</li>
<li><a href="https://input.djr.com/">Input</a> is a cool flexible font system designed for code but also offers proportional fonts. I tried it for a while but now prefer&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="https://typeof.net/Iosevka/">Iosevka</a> for my variable pitch font.</li>
<li>Here&rsquo;s a random <a href="https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown/-/blob/master/doc/Orgdown1-Syntax-Examples.org">Orgdown cheat sheet</a> that might be of use.</li>
<li>With <a href="https://reposense.org/">RepoSense</a> it&rsquo;s easy to visualise programmer activities across Git repositories. We&rsquo;re using it to track student activities and make sure everyone participates.</li>
<li>Tired of configuring tab vs space indent stuff for every programming language? Use <a href="https://editorconfig.org/">EditorConfig</a>, something that works across editors and IDEs.</li>
</ul>
