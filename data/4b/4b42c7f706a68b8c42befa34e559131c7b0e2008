<p>If you&#8217;ve been looking for a way to make your email work better with your business workflow, there&#8217;s some interesting news from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.daylite.app/mail/">Marketcircle</a>. Their Daylite platform—a CRM and project management system designed specifically for Mac and iOS—now includes a dedicated Mail component that&#8217;s entered open beta.</p>



<p>The new Daylite Mail takes Daylite’s integration concept and applies it directly to your inbox. Instead of treating email as a separate silo, it pulls your messages into the broader Daylite ecosystem where they automatically connect to contacts, projects, and opportunities.</p>



<p>Rather than relying on flags, folders, and filters to stay organized, Daylite Mail automatically links your messages to the relevant people and projects in your system. The system also includes a Priority Inbox that highlights emails connected to your business activities, helping you focus on what actually matters.</p>



<p>Since this is still in open beta, it&#8217;s a good time to take a look if you&#8217;re already in the Daylite ecosystem or considering it. You can learn more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.daylite.app/mail/">Daylite Mail and sign up for the beta</a>&nbsp;on their website.</p>
