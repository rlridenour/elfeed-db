<p>My thanks to Footnote Accessories and <a href="https://footnoteaccessories.com/?utm_source=sixcolors&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=external_link">FlashFinder</a> for sponsoring Six Colors this week.</p>
<p>FlashFinder is the first keychain flashlight that supports Find My. Wherever you put it—your keychain, your backpack, whatever—you’ll be able to find it later. And the flashlight itself is six times brighter than the flash on your phone, so you’ll always be able to find your way.</p>
<p>It’s discreet, USB-C rechargeable, and it’s a multitasker. I love a multitasker.</p>
