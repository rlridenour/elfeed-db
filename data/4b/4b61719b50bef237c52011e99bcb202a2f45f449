<blockquote>
  <p>Tim Cook is captured. There is simply no other explanation for his
actions over the past year or so. But it perhaps culminated this
weekend when Cook went to a special private showing of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_(film)?ref=spyglass.org">the
documentary <em>Melania</em></a> at the White House. Yes, <em>that</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump?ref=spyglass.org">Melania</a>. That in and of itself would have probably been
fine. I mean, it’s potentially problematic for a host of reasons
that I’ll get to, but such is our world right now. Then one shot — a gunshot — turned attending that movie screening into a
statement...</p>

<p>While Cook was enjoying his popcorn and champagne with the likes
of Mike Tyson, Tony Robbins, and other “VIPs”, it was complete and
utter chaos on the streets of Minnesota. Just hours earlier, Alex
Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot and killed by ICE
agents. Maybe, just maybe, postpone the movie premiere?</p>
