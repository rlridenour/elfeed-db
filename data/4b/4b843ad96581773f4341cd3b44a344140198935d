There are two main components of the Replay 2025 experience. First, there is a full year-end playlist containing the Apple Music songs that you listened to the most over the past year, as well as a Highlight Reel with images and a video that are designed to be shared on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok.<br/>
<br/>
You can view your total minutes spent listening to Apple Music songs, the total number of artists you listened to, your favorite genres, and more for 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Music already offers monthly Replay playlists throughout the year, but this full year-end experience provides a lot more information. This year, Apple says it has highlighted even more listening habits related to the following:<ul><li><strong>Discovery:</strong> New artists who captured your ears over the past year</li><br/>
<li><strong>Loyalty:</strong> Artists you've kept coming back to, year after year</li><br/>
<li><strong>Comebacks:</strong> Artists who made a return to your rotation</li></ul>A multi-year Replay All Time playlist with the songs that you have listened to the most since you first subscribed to Apple Music remains available.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with iOS 26, the Replay experience is fully native in the Apple Music app, but it also remains available on the web at <a href="https://replay.music.apple.com/">replay.music.apple.com</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Replay 2025 is prominently featured in the Apple Music's Home and New tabs right now, and Apple is celebrating with an <a href="https://ticketing.apple.com/~/en/miaartweek2025126">exhibit at Miami Art Week</a> this week.<br/>
