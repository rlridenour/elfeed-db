<p>In this conundrum by Mitsunobu Matsuyama, when four congruent quadrilaterals are rotated about their centers, their area seems to increase. What has become of the red square?</p>
<p>The answer is that each side of the large square is slightly shorter after the rotation. If &#952; is the angle between two opposing sides in each quadrilateral, then the ratio of the areas of the two large squares is sec<sup>2</sup> &#952;, about 0.8 percent when &#952; is 5&#176;.</p>
