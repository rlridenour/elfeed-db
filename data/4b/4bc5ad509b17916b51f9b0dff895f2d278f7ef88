<p>President Trump said he recently held a phone conversation with Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro but declined to disclose what was discussed, noting only that he &quot;wouldn’t say it went well&quot; as relations between Washington and Caracas remain strained. US pressure on Venezuela has intensified, including a significant military buildup in the Caribbean, a warning that Venezuelan airspace is &quot;closed,&quot; and the designation of an alleged drug-trafficking organization linked by Washington to Maduro as a terrorist group. The US has accused Maduro of leading the so‑called &quot;Cartel of the Suns&quot; and has offered a $50 million reward for his capture. Venezuelan authorities condemned what they describe as US preparations for an attack, framing the maneuvers as a direct threat to the country’s sovereignty. According to reporting cited by French media, the call reportedly touched on possible amnesty terms should Maduro step down, though the White House has not confirmed these details.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/XxH073fmo5x67QXnPxK0QRteBE1ZIrTahe3tura0FxuLZX7_PcvIhCVe-L7CJDZOTfO99BMX8JFW9hnFH-zmKzCLNCpHKpUwPNi_ig6b-kl5PagkKzYkc0_4uJ9dY0bQZg3JdIcf4ckD6uzNbI6vgIjmj0O3edJtvFdnPz5d7EBfaVNPctKemxwUODmV9J19pCEPzy56KKN8ROUpOGwGaZiSBAPKkCR7XKst9-Uo1f21I5CoaWTjr7Jw8laEJU8KvSXi7g' alt='President Trump speaks to reporters as questions mount over rising tensions with Venezuela.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Airspace warning: US officials have cautioned that Venezuelan airspace is considered &quot;closed&quot; by Washington, underscoring the seriousness of ongoing flight and military restrictions over the country.</li><li>Terror designation: Washington has classified an alleged drug cartel it links to Maduro as a terrorist organization, expanding the legal toolkit available for sanctions and law-enforcement measures against those associated with it.</li><li>Caribbean buildup: The US has deployed additional naval and other military assets to the Caribbean Sea near Venezuela, a move Caracas portrays as evidence of looming offensive plans.</li><li>Amnesty reporting: The Wall Street Journal, quoted by French media, reported that the phone call included discussion of potential amnesty guarantees if Maduro were to relinquish power, though neither side has publicly confirmed this version of events.</li><li>Reward offer: US authorities have publicized a reward of $50 million for information leading to Maduro’s capture, reflecting the depth of US criminal allegations against the Venezuelan leader.</li></ul><blockquote>I don’t want to comment on it.
