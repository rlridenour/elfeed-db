<p>The <strong><a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/flymake-bashate.el">flymake-bashate</a></strong> Emacs package provides a Flymake backend for <code>bashate</code>, enabling real-time style checking for Bash shell scripts within Emacs.</p>
<p><em>(This package can also work with Flycheck: simply use the flymake-flycheck package, which allows any Emacs Flymake backend to function as a Flycheck checker.)</em></p>
<p>If this enhances your workflow, please show your support by <strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/17.0.2/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> starring flymake-bashate.el on GitHub</strong> to help more Emacs users discover its benefits.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install <code>flymake-bashate</code> from MELPA:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already done so, <a href="https://melpa.org/#/getting-started">add MELPA repository to your Emacs configuration</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the following code to your Emacs init file to install <code>flymake-bashate</code> from MELPA:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(use-package flymake-bashate
:ensure t
:commands flymake-bashate-setup
:hook (((bash-ts-mode sh-mode) . flymake-bashate-setup)
      ((bash-ts-mode sh-mode) . flymake-mode))
:custom
(flymake-bashate-max-line-length 80))</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Customizations</h2>
<h3>Ignoring Bashate errors</h3>
<p>To make <code>bashate</code> ignore specific Bashate rules, such as E003 (ensure all indents are a multiple of 4 spaces) and E006 (check for lines longer than 79 columns), set the following variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(setq flymake-bashate-ignore "E003,E006")</code></pre>
<p>(This corresponds to the <code>-i</code> or <code>--ignore</code> option in Bashate.)</p>
<h3>Setting maximum line length</h3>
<p>To define the maximum line length for Bashate to check:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(setq flymake-bashate-max-line-length 80)</code></pre>
<p>(This corresponds to the <code>--max-line-length</code> option in Bashate.)</p>
<h3>Specifying the Bashate executable</h3>
<p>To change the path or filename of the Bashate executable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(setq flymake-bashate-executable "/opt/different-directory/bin/bashate")</code></pre>
<p>(Defaults to &#8220;bashate&#8221;.)</p>
