<p>India’s telecoms ministry has directed every smartphone maker selling in the country to install a government-run cybersecurity app called Sanchar Saathi on all new devices within 90 days, and to ensure it cannot be removed by users. The government says the app, already available on Android and iOS, helps people block and track stolen phones, curb IMEI tampering, and tackle a sharp rise in cybercrime cases and fraud against the country’s more than 1.2 billion telecom users. Officials have also asked companies to push the app to phones already in the supply chain via software updates, citing new Telecom Cybersecurity Rules that allow digital measures to prevent &quot;serious endangerment&quot; of telecom security. Opposition politicians, privacy advocates and some industry players warn that forcing a non-removable, state-controlled app onto an estimated 730 million smartphone users could open the door to expanded government access to personal data and device activity.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/72NGJ_ehhVIeBO4rFzON47Qs4RmbZfg3ZX1vGGe-X-WkYJLneCjsleHlKWgxTD6J6ZlTUkRJFk6C3mZCqgP0CnVunkx1JXRvb3dmjEJ9pOYG' alt='The Apple logo at a company store, as the firm weighs how to respond to India’s Sanchar Saathi preload order.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Apple’s stance: Apple has privately indicated it does not intend to comply with the preload mandate and plans to tell New Delhi that it does not accept similar government app requirements in any market because of concerns about user privacy and the integrity of its iOS ecosystem.</li><li>Scope and deadline: The directive applies to all smartphones manufactured in or imported into India after November 28, with companies given a three‑month window to ensure the app is visible on first use and its core functions remain enabled.</li><li>Existing impact claims: According to official figures cited by the app’s website, Sanchar Saathi has been used to block millions of stolen phones and to help recover a substantial number of handsets, alongside attracting tens of millions of downloads across Android and iOS platforms.</li><li>Political objections: Opposition parties in India have described the mandate as an overreach of state power, with some politicians arguing that forcing citizens to carry an undeletable government app marks an intrusion into private life and digital autonomy.</li><li>Global comparison: Reports note that India’s move echoes steps in other countries, such as Russia, where authorities have also required preinstallation or promotion of state-backed digital services on consumer devices to combat fraud and promote official apps.</li></ul><blockquote>Big brother cannot watch us every moment without our consent - Mahua Moitra, opposition politician</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Indian telecom ministry: The ministry frames Sanchar Saathi as a cyber safety tool that offers “citizen‑centric services” and says mandatory installation is needed to address what it calls a “serious endangerment” to the country’s telecom cybersecurity..
