<p>Many developers seem to have a fanatic obsession with monospace fonts and using them to make their blogs look &ldquo;cool&rdquo;. I won&rsquo;t call out anyone&rsquo;s blog specifically, but you don&rsquo;t have to look to hard to find some. As an example <em>theme</em> using a monospace font by default, look at <a href="https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal">hugo-theme-terminal</a>, which has over 2,400 stars on GitHub. If you have a blog or are thinking about starting one, and you are writing mostly prose (you probably are), I have one suggestion for you about fonts:</p>
<p><strong>Do not use monospace fonts for prose.</strong></p>
<p>Please use a nice proportionally-spaced font instead. It will be nicer for your readers.</p>
<h2 id="care-about-your-readers">
  Care about your readers

<p>I assume you care about your readers. Maybe there&rsquo;s a slim fraction of a percent of developer/writers out there who are writing just so that they have a big portfolio of &ldquo;content&rdquo; with some metrics they can use to show off or brag about on LinkedIn. Whatever—those blokes probably don&rsquo;t read much anyway, so I think I&rsquo;m safe to ignore them.</p>
<div class="marginnote">
<p>Even worse are the people who use an LLM to generate content for LinkedIn. Like, how banal can you get? Also, note that I&rsquo;m using the word <em>content</em> in a slightly pejorative sense: LinkedIn addicts will talk about content as just some stuff that you need to generate to fill a space. It&rsquo;s <em>substance</em> that matters. I want to read something that is trying to <em>say</em> something—not something that&rsquo;s just taking up space on a (web)page.</p>
</div>
<p>If you care about your readers, you should make the reading experience pleasant for them. If I open a website that makes it hard or is uncomfortable for me to read/scan/whatever, my patience for reading whatever is on that site drops and I close the page.</p>
<p>What things make a website uncomfortable to read? Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor contrast</li>
<li>Bad margins/too-long lines</li>
<li>Crappy fonts</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting light-gray text on a slightly-less-gray background is a great way to make people squint at your site in frustration. Not centering your text and/or having lines that are way too long also infuriates me. I want to read your article <em>centered</em> in my field if vision where I don&rsquo;t have to turn my head. I&rsquo;ve got a big monitor. Just slap <code>margin: auto</code> and <code>max-width: 45rem</code> on the <code>body</code> element in your CSS and you&rsquo;re good to go. It&rsquo;s not hard.</p>
<p>Monospace fonts are a bad choice for prose because—news flash—we&rsquo;re not used to reading monospace fonts! Every book on my shelf—from deeply technical texts like <em>Types and Programming Languages</em> by Pierce to high fantasy like <em>The Way of Kings</em> by Sanderson—is set in a proportional font.</p>
<p>Monospace fonts are a holdover from the typewriter age. Thankfully, our technology is well past the limitations of that machine, and good typography can rule again. If you still don&rsquo;t believe me that monospace fonts are bad for prose, maybe professional typographer-cum-programmer <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/monospaced-fonts.html">Matthew Butterick can change your mind</a>.</p>

  Monospace is good for code (duh)

<p>If you look around on my blog, you will find plenty of code set in a <a href="https://codeberg.org/ashton314/iosevka-output">monospace font</a>. Code <em>should</em> be set in a monospace font. I actually use a monospace font when I write! (Partly because I&rsquo;m used to it, and partly because I haven&rsquo;t bothered to set up <a href="https://lambdaland.org/tags/emacs/">my editor</a> to switch to something else when I&rsquo;m writing.) So please don&rsquo;t take this post as a tirade against monospace fonts in all contexts.</p>
<h2 id="just-use-your-browser-s-reader-mode">
  Just use your browser&rsquo;s reader mode!
  <a class="anchor" href="#just-use-your-browser-s-reader-mode">#</a>

<p>Yeah, I do use my browser&rsquo;s reader mode frequently when I want to read some long-form text. It&rsquo;s a nice way to get a decent-looking view of the text on a page. In some cases, it hides distracting elements, making it infinitely superior to an ad-riddled page.</p>
<p>But if reader mode is your suggestion to get around your bad monospaced font, isn&rsquo;t that an admission of failure? I would think that you would want your blog to be nice enough to look at that people <em>don&rsquo;t even think</em> about using reader mode because your website is pleasing to read as-is. If you want to include source code and images into your post, reader mode sometimes mangles those.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t advise you exactly what style you should set your blog/website in. That&rsquo;s up to you and is in large part a matter of taste. But this part is <em>not</em> subjective: prose is meant to be set in a proportional font.</p>
<p>Please stop using monospace for prose.</p>
