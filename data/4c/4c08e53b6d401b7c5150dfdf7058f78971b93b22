<p>It&rsquo;s a long and interesting article. Doctorow knows his way around privacy laws and terms of service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As things stand, Bluesky has very bad terms of service that every user who creates an account has to subject themselves to. In particular, Bluesky&rsquo;s ToS contain a &ldquo;binding arbitration&rdquo; waiver that forces users to surrender the right to sue Bluesky no matter how the company harms them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bottleneck problem. You want to use Bluesky, you have to have an account with them, which essentially means it&rsquo;s their account and data to do whatever they wish with it. And even though Blue Sky is pretty cool and Jay Graber is pretty awesome, their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_Capital">investors</a> aren&rsquo;t necessarily good news, and when they want more money, we&rsquo;ll have the same old problem we always have.</p>
