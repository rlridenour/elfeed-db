The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Air can charge with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> at up to 20W, according to Apple's technical specifications page for the new device. <br/>

20W is 5W slower than the 25W that the other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models (and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models) can charge at using one of Apple's updated &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; adapters. It is also limited to 20W Qi2 speeds instead of the 25W enabled by Qi2.2. <br/>
<br/>
To fast charge wirelessly, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air needs a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger paired with a 30W adapter or higher, but for charging over USB-C, 20W is sufficient for fast charge. Fast charging provides a 50 percent charge in a 30 minute period. <br/>
<br/>
With the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Battery that Apple designed for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air, wireless charging is limited to 12W unless the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Battery is plugged in and providing passthrough charging capabilities. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air has the smallest battery of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup, which could explain why it is not able to charge at the same speed. It uses high density battery technology, and that may also be a factor. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-air-20w-magsafe-charging/">iPhone Air Limited to 20W MagSafe Charging</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-limited-to-20w-magsafe-charging.2465002/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
