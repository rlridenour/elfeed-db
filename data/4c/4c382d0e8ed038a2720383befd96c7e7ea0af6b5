<p>Apple&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/introducing-apple-creator-studio-an-inspiring-collection-of-creative-apps/">announced Creator Studio this week</a>, bundling Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage along with enhanced versions of Pages, Numbers and Keynote into a $130/year subscription.</p>



<p>My feelings are mixed. Every time Apple rolls out a new subscription, I get a little leery. The company&#8217;s increasing focus on services revenue feels like a slow drift away from the traditional model: make great hardware, sell it, move on. I understand the business logic. I just notice the shift.</p>



<p>That said, I&#8217;m genuinely relieved about Pixelmator Pro. When Apple acquired it, I feared the app would get thrown into a wood chipper and turned into new features for Photos. Instead, it survives intact and gains an iPad version. For someone who uses and loves Pixelmator Pro, this is good news.</p>



<p>The creator tools lineup is impressive. I use Final Cut and Pixelmator often. Compressor renders my MacSparky Labs deliverables. MainStage is part of my music practice routine. I fire up Logic occasionally. These are serious applications, and $130/year to keep them current feels reasonable to me.</p>



<p>I also appreciate that Apple preserved the option to buy these apps outright. You&#8217;re not forced into a subscription. If you prefer a one-time purchase, that path remains open. This flexibility acknowledges that different users have different preferences, and it&#8217;s a smart move.</p>



<p>So what&#8217;s the problem?</p>



<p>The iWork suite.</p>



<p>Pages, Numbers, and Keynote have been free for years. They&#8217;ll stay free. But now there&#8217;s a separate tier within Creator Studio that adds new templates and Apple Intelligence features to these apps. If you want those extras, you need the $130 subscription.</p>



<p>From conversations with MacSparky Labs members, this isn&#8217;t landing well. Many of them have zero interest in Final Cut or Logic. They just want the latest iWork features. Asking them to pay $130 for that feels unreasonable.</p>



<p>Could Apple offer a cheaper iWork-only tier? Maybe $30/year? Possibly, but that starts to feel like nickel-and-diming. Apple is a multi-trillion dollar company in the middle of a major push to make Apple Intelligence central to everything they do. The better answer is simpler: make those iWork features free for everyone.</p>



<p>If I had a magic wand, I&#8217;d remove the iWork suite from Creator Studio entirely. The new templates and AI features would roll out as free updates to apps that are already free. The Creator Studio subscription would focus on what it should focus on: professional creative tools for people who actually use them.</p>



<p>By trying to sweeten the Creator Studio deal with iWork additions, Apple ended up frustrating users who don&#8217;t need video editing or music production software but do want the best version of Pages or Keynote. It&#8217;s a bundle that serves almost nobody perfectly.</p>



<p>I suspect the ship has sailed on this one. But I hope Apple course corrects.</p>
