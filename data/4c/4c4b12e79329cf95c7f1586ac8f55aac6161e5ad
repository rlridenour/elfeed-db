As reported in <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2025/09/26/THAFOBRHUJFA3JU523KX23ZVWE/"><em>Chosun Biz</em></a>, Cheong last week told journalists in Seoul that the company is accelerating preparations for mass production of OLED displays designed for foldable smartphones to be supplied to a "North American client." He declined to provide further information about the client, but it is widely expected to be Apple. <br/>

The comments reflect the solidification of rumors around Apple's first foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, which is now believed to be less than a year away from launch. It is expected to arrive alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> lineup in 2026, featuring an inward-folding crease-free display, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> instead of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, the A20 chip, and two rear cameras. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/29/samsung-plan-to-make-foldable-displays/">Samsung Confirms Plan to Make Foldable Displays for Major American Company</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-confirms-plan-to-make-foldable-displays-for-major-american-company.2467855/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
