After my post <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12894">Initial Thoughts On Journelly</a>, in which I recounted how I&rsquo;m using Álvaro Ramírez&rsquo;s Journelly app, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12894#comment-6684247988">Bren Smith</a> asked me to share my configuration for sharing files between my iOS devices and my Mac. If you&rsquo;re an Emacs user and want to enjoy the full power of Journelly, it&rsquo;s important to be able to share the files between your iOS devices and your Macs.
</p>
<p>
The thing is, it&rsquo;s so easy that it didn&rsquo;t occur to me an explanation was needed. By default, Journelly keeps all its files locally on your phone or other iOS device but it&rsquo;s possible to store them in the iCloud or, really, anywhere that&rsquo;s reachable from your Mac and your iPhone/iPad. If you click on the three dots at the upper right of the Journelly screen and then choose <b>Storage → iCloud Drive</b>, Journelly will allow you to store your files in the iCloud. From there you can easily access them from your Mac.
</p>
<p>
Apple&rsquo;s default location for storing the files is a long and complex file spec so you&rsquo;ll probably want to set a symbolic link to it so that it&rsquo;s easy to access from the Mac. Once you&rsquo;ve done that, it&rsquo;s easy to bring up the Journelly file in the usual way from Emacs or any other app.
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s also possible to put the files somewhere else in the iCloud by using the <b>Storage → Other&#x2026;</b> option. I did this so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to navigate the complex file spec but in the end, it turned out to be easier to just set a symbolic link so I recommend you just use the <b>Storage → iCloud Drive</b> option. On the other hand, I <i>think</i>, but haven&rsquo;t verified, that you can use <b>Storage → Other&#x2026;</b> to store the files anywhere you like but I don&rsquo;t know the details.
</p>
<p>
The other thing to keep in mind is that Journelly is still in beta so any or all of this could change. Still, I&rsquo;ve been using this setup every day without any problems.</p>
