<p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has sentenced California physician Salvador Plasencia to two and a half years in prison for illegally supplying ketamine to Friends actor Matthew Perry in the weeks before Perry’s fatal overdose in 2023. Plasencia, 44, had pleaded guilty to a felony charge related to distributing the powerful anaesthetic outside proper medical channels at steep markups, including to the actor. The court stressed that the ketamine that directly caused Perry’s death came from another source, but found that Plasencia and others had helped sustain the actor’s addiction, contributing to the circumstances that led to his death at home in Los Angeles last year. Plasencia’s sentence, which also includes two years of probation and a financial penalty, is the first handed down among five defendants who have pleaded guilty in connection with the case, marking a significant step in the broader investigation into Perry’s drug suppliers.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uiE6t-X7fVq_1OeHWylelLkRcBxAQugvBdhBa6uS5XJnL3JI7YPwo67gdL1wnj3ExpjVBhkIQ0mwa7SCbnHqyKqJAu3eIJqiDl4Z-GDfbzZ5l0AdvPpXf1yEN746gHVfEB9_RjRSh3Ms_moyDKksA_A2GvAJR13Xuw5y6x1ssvyr362Q5rsrRH5vQj3i8Q1SH79A7ZJqpvXCcAVJlSwFY81U5KnngZvvc6VnMgNz4a2QowzSSGm6LEzGgvl1pvAMI3wQ2L8kBPRvEf3y9w' alt='Actor Matthew Perry speaks at a New York event in 2017, several years before his death from a ketamine-related overdose in Los Angeles.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Additional penalties: Beyond the prison term, Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett ordered Plasencia to serve two years of supervised release and pay a US$5,600 fine, underscoring the seriousness of the offence despite his lack of direct involvement in providing the fatal dose.</li><li>Pricing practices: Investigators said Plasencia sold ketamine to Perry at substantial markups compared with normal costs, profiting from the actor’s dependency rather than providing legitimate treatment.</li><li>Network of suppliers: Authorities describe Perry’s case as involving a wider network of individuals who illegally supplied him with drugs, with Plasencia the first among five defendants who have admitted guilt to receive a sentence in federal court.</li><li>Emotional hearing: The sentencing hearing in Los Angeles federal court was described as emotional, reflecting the high-profile nature of Perry’s death and the impact of addiction on those close to him.</li><li>Charge context: Plasencia admitted to violating federal drug laws by distributing ketamine outside accepted medical practice, a crime prosecutors argued endangered not only Perry but also the wider public by undermining safe prescribing standards.</li></ul><blockquote>You and others helped Mr. Perry on the road to such an ending by continuing to fuel his addiction - Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Judge Sherilyn Peace Garnett: The judge acknowledged that Plasencia did not provide the specific ketamine dose that killed Perry but stated in court that his conduct, along with that of others, helped keep the actor on a path toward a fatal outcome by sustaining his addiction.
