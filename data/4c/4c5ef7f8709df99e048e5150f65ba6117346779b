<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Installing #GrapheneOS on a new #Android #Pixel phone, while also being deliberate about how and what I bring along for my new installation. All while working at further de-Googling.
</p>
<p>My previous phone was a vendor locked Samsung device. It was still working.
However, as I started researching privacy and security, paired with looming
trade war uncertainty with the arrival of a new GOP regime, I wanted my device
to have some longevity.</p>
<p>I had a functional phone, but was growing concerned about its very leaky
privacy.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>One resource I have read through is <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/">Surveillance Self-Defense</a> by <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic
Frontier Foundation</a>. I have spent time updating mine and my family’s devices to
follow their recommendations.</p>
<p>A section that stands out is <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-to-get-to-know-android-privacy-and-security-settings#install-a-custom-distribution">How to: Get to Know Android Privacy and Security
Settings &gt; Install a Custom Distribution</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="h-cite">
Google’s services are deeply integrated in Android. While the above steps can
mitigate some of the most privacy-invasive issues with Google, you cannot remove
that threat completely without using a different operating system entirely.
</blockquote>
<p>The page then describes several custom ROMs. One being <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>: an install
that I’ve heard referenced amongst various information security workers.</p>
<p>I spent an evening reading the extensive documentation. And it made sense, in
that the project is not concerned with security theater but instead looking to
threat models and mitigation strategies.</p>
<h2 id="on-walled-gardens">On Walled Gardens</h2>
<p>I had also considered switching to an iPhone; my daily driver computer is
presently an M1 Macbook Air; there’s tremendous synergy further entering
Apple’s walled garden.</p>
<p>However, I’m also in the process of re-evaluating my computing ecosystem. When
I take inventory of my computer I use two primary applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emacs</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
</ul>
<p>I got a <a href="https://libre.computer/products/aml-s905x-cc-v2/">Libre Computer Sweet Potato</a> for <time datetime="2024-12-25" title="2024-12-25">Christmas</time> and installed <span><a href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Debian”" title="Other site-wide references of “Debian”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-DEBIAN">&#128214;</a></small>
and
Gnome. Looking at the desktop and terminal, I realized that <span>Debian</span>
would be
perfect for my every day operating system.</p>
<p>I even went down the path of partitioning my Macbook Air to boot <span>Debian</span>
; however
I halted when I hit a “this will reduce the security of your computer” warning.
I need to learn more about that.</p>
<p>Instead of choosing the path into the walled garden, I chose the path with many
more options.</p>
<h2 id="settling-on-graphene">Settling on Graphene</h2>
<p>There are other custom ROMs but I appreciated the in-depth conversational tone
of <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>’s documentation.</p>
<p>I set about trying to unlock my Samsung phone, but my carrier had locked the
device. Which meant I was unable to flash <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> onto my Samsung.</p>
<p>I read <a href="https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices">Which devices are recommended?</a> and <a href="https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-lifetime">How long can GrapheneOS support my
device for?</a> It looked as though I was going to need a Pixel.</p>
<p>I had always avoided Pixel phones, but seeing <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> listing them as the
only “supported” devices, I chose one that had a 7 year minimum support window.</p>
<h2 id="setup-and-install-process">Setup and Install Process</h2>
<p>I chose the <a href="https://grapheneos.org/install/cli">CLI install guide for installing GrapheneOS</a>. I installed the
necessary command-line tools and spent an hour getting my baseline installation.
The biggest “delay” was me not quite knowing the bootloader behavior; meaning I
had a few “oops I restarted” missteps.</p>
<p>I went through the process of getting my SIM setup so I could send and receive
calls and texts. And then I set about installing applications.</p>
<p>Most important: my password manager. With that I could more easily install and
sign-in to other applications/services.</p>
<p><a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> documentation references Google Play Services quite often; it’s the
spinal column of the Android ecosystem, and a significant vector for Google
prying eyes deep into your mobile activity.</p>
<p>I ended up installing several applications from the Google Play Store, but also
installed the <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid application</a>, which provides a catalog of free and open
source applications.</p>
<p>Two applications of note:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.madlonkay.orgro/">Orgro</a></dt>
<dd>Live your life in Org Mode? Take it with you on your Android device.
This focused on reading Org Mode files. Something my phone can now do!</dd>
<dt><a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/biz.binarysolutions.healthybatterycharging/">Healthy Battery Charging</a></dt>
<dd>The pitch drew me in: “Make your smartphone or tablet
battery last longer!”</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="severing-more-of-google">Severing More of Google</h2>
<p>On my old Samsung, I had a myriad of Google Applications. I had accepted that
with Google Play Services running, it really didn’t matter I used from Google.
They had everything.</p>
<p>However, with my new phone, Google was relegated to the sandbox and had far less
privileges. I reviewed what I wanted on my mobile phone:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Maps</dt>
<dd>I use this for navigation, it’s far to useful.</dd>
<dt>Mail</dt>
<dd>I have moved my email away from Google, but for “legacy reasons” I
still want access.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I knew that I wanted to begin removing my reliance on Google Contacts. And this
was the time. I had previously synchronized my contacts between Google and
Proton. So I identified that going forward Proton would be my canonical source.</p>
<p>But Proton, as of <time datetime="2025-01-05" title="2025-01-05">today</time>, does not have a “contacts” application. See <a href="https://proton.me/support/proton-contacts-mobile">Setting up
Proton Contacts on your mobile device</a>. I chose to export those contacts and
load them into my new phones local contact list. Why? Because I wanted to see
who was calling and texting me.</p>
<p>Going forward, if I added contacts, I’d want to make sure to propagate them to
Proton.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Getting my new phone up and running was a slower process because I chose not to
automatically carry over everything from my previous phone. (I don’t think I
could have once I chose <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> instead of Pixel’s default Android instance).</p>
<p>Slowing down and reviewing was an intentional act. One of “de-cluterring” as
well as “needs assessment.”</p>
<p>For a moment, I anguished about the synchronized contacts. It’s super
convenient, but then I thought “how many contacts am I adding?” I’d guess no
more than one a month. And I can do the manual steps to handle that.</p>
<p>I also would’ve preferred to re-purpose my old phone, but it wasn’t viable. So
I went with picking something that would have a longer minimum lifetime.</p>
