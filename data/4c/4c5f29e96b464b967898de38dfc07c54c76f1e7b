  <p>I really liked the 30-minute format and the breadth of topics:
everything from API details to broader <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/315">design considerations</a>,
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@chockenberry/112163190336674442">stats</a> from their own businesses, and postmortems, plus all the
stuff he mentioned.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve never been an indie software developer, but I found the
podcast extremely insightful. It’s influenced how I’ve thought
about my non-indie software development career, not just as
someone delivering bits that indies use, but also as a product
person who writes software as a means to an end.</p>
