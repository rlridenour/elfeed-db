</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
An important book in my personal journey; with topics of #feminism, #antiRacism, and #decolonization; and receipts on the atrocities the aforementioned address.
</p>
        <p>I know that I have work to do.  I’m one of the “benefactors” of white supremacy
and colonialism.  “Benefactors” in that the focus of the system’s harm is folks
other than me, but also in that the system ultimately benefits no one.</p>
<p>Last weekend, we visited a local independent bookstore, amongst other things, I
picked <cite data-id="ISBN-9781644452110">Black and Female</cite> by Tsitsi Dangarembga.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-09-26" title="2025-09-26">Yesterday</time> and <time datetime="2025-09-27" title="2025-09-27">this morning</time>, I read the three essays:</p>
<ul>
<li><cite>Writing While Black and Female</cite></li>
<li><cite>Black, Female, and the Superwoman Black Feminist</cite></li>
<li><cite>Decolonisation as Revolutionary Imagining</cite></li>
</ul>
<p>My pencil was busy annotating and underlining, as I felt my understanding
expand, gaining an ever broader view beyond an actively maintained obfuscation.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="colonisation-was-constructed-purposefully">
<p>
Colonisation was constructed purposefully to ensure that its effects were
neither perceived nor questioned.
</p>
<footer>&#8213;Tsitsi Dangarembga, <cite>Black and Female</cite></footer></blockquote>
<p>And within it’s broader context:</p>
<div class="org-center">
<p>
All too seldom, in the history of the institution of Western colonisation, has
discourse engaged with what may be called the metaphysical, that is the
cognitive and affective—the subjective—forms of colonial violence.  This is
hardly surprising as colonisation was constructed purposefully to ensure that
its effects were neither perceived nor questioned.
</p>
</div>
<p>And <cite data-id="ISBN-9781644452110">Black and Female</cite> works to bear witness to the violence and harm—at the
personal, national, and global-level—thus opening/widening the aperture through
which I (the reader) may perceive and question the effects.</p>
<p>Reading of Zimbabwe’s independence, with its early moments of liberation then
perverted into a deeply misogynistic two-class system.  And wondering how that
might rhyme with the present trajectory of the United States.</p>
<p>And nothing so clearly depicts the rapacious nature of what we collectively must
face than the following passage:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

A major, early objective of empire was what it called “trade.”  Trade that
premised on desire.  Desire without love dwindles into lust, and empires, being
impersonal, cannot love.  Lust—impersonal desire that demands satisfaction—is
dangerous at every level: personal, the social, the global.  Imperial lust has
wounded every part of the world empire touched, and today we know it has wounded
the very planet that is our home.  Thus has empire mutilated not only those it
sought to subjugate, but also itself.

</blockquote>

<p>But the tasks I must take, with my low amounts a melanin, are different from
those with greater amounts of melanin.  And what are my tasks?  Dangarembga does
not directly name that work for me.</p>
<p>But I have three clues.  First is this passage:</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="white-people-do-not-know-what-makes-them-white">
<p>
White people do not know what makes them white because the world is created
through white normative power: nothing pushes back at whiteness to remind it
where its boundaries lie and how stifling those boundaries are.
</p>
<footer>&#8213;Tsitsi Dangarembga, <cite>Black and Female</cite></footer></blockquote>
<p>Second is this passage:</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="i-learnt-the-feminist-methodology">
<p>
I learnt the feminist methodology of flattened structures, mutual support,
caregiving and of locating the personal in the political.
</p>
<footer>&#8213;Tsitsi Dangarembga, <cite>Black and Female</cite></footer></blockquote>
<p>And third this:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

The tears of the process water bushes and trees so that their roots may do the
work of holding together that which was pulled violently apart.  Through
writing, I cultivate my being to bring forth forests that replenish our depleted
humanity.

</blockquote>

<p>My read is that I should not abandon this colonized space.  The system would
replace it.  Instead, I should to the feminist methodology to inform my praxis,
such that I can rehabilitate the local colonized space (and myself) to be
hospitable and fertile ground for all of humanity.  I know I’ve failed at that
and will continue to stumble, as I know I carry the following:</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="knowledge-that-is-founded-on-notions-of-inequality">
<p>
Knowledge that is founded on notions of inequality will build unequal worlds for
humans to occupy and unequal systems for us to function in.
</p>
<footer>&#8213;Tsitsi Dangarembga, <cite>Black and Female</cite></footer></blockquote>
<p>Which is made all the more difficult as “the ravages of empire stretch further
in time and space than we usually care to imagine.”</p>
<p>The task ahead is daunting; in that it is partially invisible to me, but also
that I know I can move on auto-pilot, and the present state of the system will,
for now, support me…but that time will run out.  Yet, as Dangarembga writes,
“imagination is the necessary link between desiring and doing.”  And this
exercise in reading and writing is in receiving those tears and doing my best to
appreciate that gift and from there work towards replenishment.</p>
<p>Having just published <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/09/27/on-an-inner-library/">On an Inner Library</a> and revisited my Twenty Books that
Have Stayed With Me; I know that <cite data-id="ISBN-9781644452110">Black and Female</cite> will move onto that list.</p>
