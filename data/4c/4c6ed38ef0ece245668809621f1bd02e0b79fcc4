<p>The President of <a href="https://www.monmouthcollege.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monmouth College</a>, a private liberal arts college in Illinois, has recently announced that students at the school will no longer be able to major in philosophy, nor in a number of other subjects, starting in Fall 2026.<span id="more-54571"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;We stand firm to our commitment as a liberal arts college and embrace the traditions of Monmouth and liberal arts schools,&#8221; said President Patricia Draves, as she <a href="https://www.monmouthcollege.edu/offices/presidents-office/academic-program-prioritization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the elimination of major programs in philosophy, history, classics, anthropology, sociology, religious studies, and other areas.</p>
<p>Apart from some vague language about how the set of cuts &#8220;ensures our commitment to educational quality and aligns it with the College’s mission and financial resources,&#8221; there was no explanation for the specific decisions.</p>
<p>The elimination of the philosophy major will also mean the elimination of the one remaining philosophy faculty position and the elimination of the <a href="https://www.monmouthcollege.edu/academics/philosophy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies</a>.</p>
<p>A petition, entitled, &#8220;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dJ0AisSEL98S6mdEMue09YRp0X_xm5BTbIi_QnQtvgM/mobilebasic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Save the Humanities at Monmouth College</a>,&#8221; is now circulating. It is from &#8220;former majors, minors, friends and supporters&#8221; of the targeted departments, &#8220;and those generally concerned with the maintenance of the institution’s longstanding commitment to the liberal arts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the petition&#8217;s text:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We are concerned that the elimination of these majors is, in reality, the elimination of the meaningful study of the humanities at the College.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The President’s email states that the changes recommended by the Task Force would “allow the college to focus on what today’s students and families value most: affordability, strong outcomes, and a meaningful educational experience.” We ask: how is a meaningful educational experience possible when students cannot engage seriously with anthropology, sociology, history, philosophy or religious studies—the very disciplines that help us understand what it means to be human?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The email further states that the College’s reorganization “will foster more interdisciplinary collaboration.” We ask: how is more interdisciplinary collaboration possible when entire disciplines will cease to exist in a substantive way? With whom will faculty and students collaborate when their peers and mentors are no longer at the College? The prioritization process page states that “courses” will continue to be offered in many of the terminated disciplines, even though majors, minors, and departments will be eliminated. How will this be possible without faculty?</em></p>
<p>The petition&#8217;s authors</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>call on the President, the Board of Trustees, and the Faculty Senate to reconsider this decision and halt the disastrous abolition of majors in anthropology, history, sociology, philosophy, and religious studies at Monmouth College. Furthermore, we ask for representatives of the College Administration to enter into a dialogue with the broader College community to find an alternative path forward.</em></p>
