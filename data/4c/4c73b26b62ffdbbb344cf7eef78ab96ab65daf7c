Seems like I have work to do.</p><p>28 Days Later sets us up with our usual blend of zombie apocalypse with its own little twists; there's nothing too original that we haven't seen before, one way or another. What is a bit different is that this movie is not about the zombi.. err, infected, as much as it's about human nature and violence. </p><p>Toward the end, there's a bit lord of the Flies kind of thing going on, but with grown men instead of.. You know what? Scratch that, they're nothing more than children with guns. This is also the point where the protagonist goes through some near death experience that tranfsform him into a lean mean killing machine who can take on the soliders and the infected and save his girlfriend who up to that point was a doing fine kicking ass on her own, but you know, her hero is around so now she's poor and helpless and can't do anything. They even got her a dress and all. That's where the movie went from 3 - 3.5 for me to a mere two stars. </p><p>Not sure if I want to watch the next one, hopefully it's not the same formula again.</p>
