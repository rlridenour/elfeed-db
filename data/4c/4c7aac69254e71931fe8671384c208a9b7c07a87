Turns out that Postgres has beautiful support for &ldquo;array&rdquo; field types. In one database of mine, I use this to keep track of the recipients of emails:
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS &#34;email_log&#34; CASCADE; CREATE TABLE &#34;email_log&#34; ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, sender TEXT NOT NULL, recipients TEXT[] NOT NULL, message TEXT, sent_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, info JSONB); -- Note the recipients TEXT[] definition: that&#39;s an array of texts. Now for the use-case: a user might have multiple email addresses, and the email_log tracks recipient ADDRESSES not user-ids.
