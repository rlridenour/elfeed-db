<p>Venezuela says it has started releasing political prisoners in what officials described as a goodwill effort, a step long sought by families and the political opposition. The development follows the apprehension of President Nicolás Maduro, after which the opposition renewed demands for detainees’ freedom and vowed to “rescue” him. President Trump publicly claimed U.S. pressure helped prompt the releases, linking it to earlier U.S. decisions regarding Venezuela. On the ground, relatives and rights advocates say the rollout has been slow and limited so far, leaving many families still waiting for loved ones to walk out.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/_WFd_paSh6v0YiMzGIwRU3VTq3AXjhHGjPqOJGGSr3kRLraBTgtn4bY69WoqgIjoGNa64Jp_vX-meb_Iuk2byiTSaG8s325OkKIEPT57W4Zq10nSXvJz2Boek7-rcsyZq4gDHiXvkjRqNc-OYMBNgev8l00' alt='Image related to reported slow-moving political prisoner releases in Venezuela.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Families in limbo: After an official announcement that an “important number” would be freed, only a small number had been released as families gathered outside detention centers seeking confirmation and names.</li><li>Third day pace: Venezuela’s releases stretched into a third day, with reporting describing the process as slow-moving despite the government’s earlier pledge of a significant number of releases.</li><li>Opposition condition: The political opposition has treated prisoner releases as a core demand in the wake of Maduro’s apprehension, framing it as part of negotiations and broader political leverage.</li><li>U.S. military signal: CBS reported President Trump had previously said he called off a “second wave of attacks” on what he described as a cooperative Venezuela.</li><li>Credit dispute: President Trump said Venezuela began releasing prisoners “in a big way” after U.S. action against Venezuela’s leadership, while other coverage emphasizes Venezuelan officials presenting the move as their own goodwill step.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Venezuelan government: Officials portrayed the releases as a goodwill effort and pledged a significant number would be freed.
