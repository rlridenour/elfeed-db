I&rsquo;ve been reading Peter Provo&rsquo;s&rsquo; book <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13184">Emacs Writing Studio</a> and one of the points he makes early on is that &ldquo;word processing&rdquo; is different from what it used to be. The traditional paradigm considers word processing from the point of view of the printed page but that&rsquo;s no longer a useful way of looking at it. Today the written word may be published as HTML on the Web, as an e-book, as a text file, or even as a traditional printed book. Prevos&rsquo; point is that GUI word processors are no loner fit for purpose.
</p>
<p>
Oddly, Emacs never embraced the traditional paradigm, probably because it started life as a code editor and only later came to be used for writing books and other &ldquo;published&rdquo; entities. That raises the question of what an Emacs &ldquo;page&rdquo; is and how you work with it.
</p>
<p>
Many Emacs users are probably unaware that there is such a construct. The closest thing they&rsquo;re familiar with is the &ldquo;current screen&rdquo;, which can be paged forward and backward with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> and <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd>. But how much data is displayed on the that screen depends on how many lines there are in the current window.
</p>
<p>
A &ldquo;page&rdquo; is different. It doesn&rsquo;t depends of the window size and doesn&rsquo;t even necessarily have a uniform size even in the same file. A &ldquo;page&rdquo; in Emacs is simply the text between two special markers—line feeds, <code>^L</code>, be default. Hardly anyone uses them these days but they can be useful for organizing a text file into sections  for easy navigation.

Charles Choi notes that although there <i>are</i> <code>forward page</code> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>]</kbd>) and <code>backward-page</code> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>[</kbd>) commands, they don&rsquo;t act in the way you might expect, which is the put the top of the page at the top of the screen.
</p>

Naturally, Choi <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/fixing-emacs-page-navigation.html">has a solution</a>. It&rsquo;s a bit of simple Elisp that calls forward/back-page and then recenters it so that the top of page is at the top of screen. If you&rsquo;re interested in working with pages, take a look at Choi&rsquo;s post.</p>
