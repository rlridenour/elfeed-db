The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> will feature a slightly smaller charging case and a capacitive pairing button, according to the leaker known as <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/airpods-pro-3-new-design-unveiled/">Majin Bu</a>.<br/>

Citing discussions with a prominent accessory manufacturer, the leaker says that the charging case of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; could be slightly smaller than that of the current model, but will otherwise will be "almost identical" with no major changes. <a href="https://x.com/asherdipps/status/1960281930441626017">Other reports</a> similarly indicate that the charging case may be marginally smaller.<br/>
<br/>
The rear pairing button is to be removed and replaced with a capacitive button on the front of the case, just like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>. As a result, accessory makers no longer need to make allowances for the physical rear pairing button. Additional functionality for the new capacitive button, such as playback controls, is also possible. The lanyard loop continues to be present. <br/>
