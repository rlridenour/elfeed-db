<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
An early morning of traveling home, to sit beside a warming radiator.  Listening to #birdsong and looking upon a frozen over lake.
</p>
        <p>I woke up at 5:30am, 30 minutes before my alarm might ring.  As I’ve gotten
older, my body knows when an alarm is set, and always wakes before the peace
shattering noise of a time’s tyranny.</p>
<p>I showered, dressed, let the dogs out for a bit, and left the house; heading for
home to meet the folks installing our counter tops.  With a bit of luck, I
thought to myself, I might see sunrise over the lake.</p>
<p>Arriving at the house, I noticed something new: a light was on in the garage.  I
smiled, power had been restored; if only piecemeal.</p>
<p>I entered, walking around, and looking at <time datetime="2025-01-06" title="2025-01-06">yesterday</time>’s work: flipping switches
and noting the red glow of GFI.  But birdsong distracted me.</p>
<p>Outside, on the plants framing the stairs, a Carolina Wren sang louder than I
thought its little body should.  I looked to the lake.  It had changed since
<time datetime="2025-01-05" title="2025-01-05">Sunday</time>.</p>
<p>This lake is new to me and I don’t know its moods nor tempers.</p>
<p>The sustained cold, below freezing with minimal warming sun, had strengthened
and smoothed the surface.  The ice was forming, more confident that it might
stand a chance to hold those brave fisher folk, eager to augur and plumb.</p>
<p>I bumped the thermostat up from 62º to 64º and listened to the pipes swell and
burble with their joyful radiant heat.  Soon, we hope to move back in.  To watch
and learn of a small lake turning from season to season, through storm and calm.</p>
