<p>Remember when I <a href="https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/spinning-and-balance/">wrote about learning to spin</a>? I haven&rsquo;t written about it since, but I really got into spinning, and making yarn made remember how good knitting can be when you only have half an hour or so and want something relaxing and productive to do with your hands. Hobbies have a way of reproducing, at least, they do for me. I loved using the drop spindle, but thinking ahead, I realised that if I wanted to spin enough yarn for a project larger than a pair of socks and finish it this decade, I probably needed a faster way to do it. You can carry a drop spindle around and so fit spinning around other activities, but I am still very limited for time. Something that is faster when I have time to spin would be better.</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://www.dreamingrobots.com/">Electric Eel Wheel (or EEW) 6.1</a>.</p>
<p>I would love a traditional wooden, foot-treadled spinning wheel. I love treadling my Singer 201K, so I&rsquo;m sure I would enjoy it, but I simply don&rsquo;t have space for a traditional spinning wheel. They are also quite pricey. A number of companies now make e-spinners: spinning wheels powered by a small electric motor, which are compact and a bit more transportable than traditional wheels. Another advantage is that they can be more ergonomic, as you are not limited to the position that enables you to treadle comfortably. You can sit as close to or as far away from the spinner as you like, place it at right angles to your working position, at whatever height you want, and so on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, e-spinners can also be very expensive. However, Dreaming Robots make much more affordable wheels by keeping the costs down by using 3D printing. When I started thinking about getting an e-spinner, they had just updated their larger e-spinner (the EEW 6) to a new 6.1 version with some nice improvements, so it seemed like a good time to buy. I also bought one of their &lsquo;Lazy Kates&rsquo; (the name for a stand that holds two or more bobbins for easy plying), as I used a rather makeshift solution before that didn&rsquo;t work particularly well.</p>

<p>The EEW 6.1 is very cleverly designed, and easy to set up, change bobbins and so on. It is set up in what is called Scotch tension. The motor drives the flyer (the arm that spins around the bobbin, putting the twist into the yarn) and a brake band differentially slows the rotation of the bobbin, which controls the rate at which the newly made yarn winds on to the bobbin. There&rsquo;s also a speed control, and a switch to reverse the direction, enabling you to spin in one direction (&lsquo;Z&rsquo;) and ply in the other (&lsquo;S&rsquo;). You need the flyer to rotate faster when making thin yarn, and the bobbin to take up yarn more slowly, so that the fibres have time to accumulate enough twist. The reverse is true for thicker yarn: the speed should be slower and the take up stronger to avoid over-twisting the yarn.</p>
<p>Essentially, the only difference between a traditional wheel and an e-spinner &mdash; as far as technique goes &mdash; is that once you have set the speed on the speed dial, it will spin at that speed all day, so that you don&rsquo;t have to try to treadle at a constant rate with your feet. That&rsquo;s a big help for a beginner. However, most of the skill is at the business end of the spinning process, which is how you &lsquo;draft&rsquo; the fibre with your hands. Pulling out a bunch of fibres has to be done at a regular rate, and in a consistent way in order to spin fibre of a particular thickness that has just the right amount of twist to have structural integrity.</p>
<p>I have had so much fun with the EEW so far. I&rsquo;ve been focusing on playfully exploring how I can change the characteristics of the yarn I am making, and what works best for me in terms of speed, so the yarn I have made is not the most consistent thing in the world (let&rsquo;s call it &lsquo;art yarn&rsquo;). However, the rate at which I can produce it compared to the drop spindle is amazing and very encouraging, so I can see that it should be possible for me to spin enough yarn for a decent sized project in a manageable amount of time. It&rsquo;s quite mesmerising too, so I have to make myself pay attention, or I drift off into a daydream feeling the twist buzz into the yarn I am making, and end up with either too much twist or too little. Spinning is definitely one of those skills which is quite easy to pick up at a very basic level (i.e. making something that more or less resembles yarn), but has so many nuances you need to master in order to produce really nice yarn that matches the characteristics you intended. It&rsquo;s very absorbing!</p>
<p>So far, I have finished spinning the batch of Jacob sheep fleece that I bought when I started spinning and produced a decent sized skein of roughly worsted to aran weight yarn (it varies&hellip;). I&rsquo;ve also spun what I had left of the Blue Faced Leicester fleece, trying to go for a roughly 4ply weight, and my plan is to ply that this weekend. Once finished, I&rsquo;m going to use these skeins to try dyeing, as I already had some acid dyes (which are needed for wool), and I might as well experiment and then make something fun with the end result, like some thick mittens. It&rsquo;s going to be rough and ready, but it&rsquo;s all part of the learning process, and I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun with it.</p>
