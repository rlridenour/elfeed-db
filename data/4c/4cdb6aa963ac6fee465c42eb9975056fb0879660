The other day when I wrote about Álvaro Ramírez&rsquo;s <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13210">elevator pitch post</a>, I mentioned that one of the things I liked was that his list of unexpected tasks that you could accomplish with Emacs contained links to posts where he explored that particular task in more depth. One of those posts was <a href="https://xenodium.com/a-platform-that-moulds-to-your-needs">&ldquo;Help me learn Japanese&rdquo;</a>. Since I&rsquo;m learning Spanish, that seemed like a nice post to revisit.

I remember reading it 8 months ago when it first came out but thought that I hadn&rsquo;t written about it. After I wrote this post, I checked just to make sure and oops, I <i>had</i> written about it. Since the previous post seems a bit better written to me, I invite you to <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12739">go read it </a> and I&rsquo;ll delete this version. Sorry for (my) confusion.</p>
