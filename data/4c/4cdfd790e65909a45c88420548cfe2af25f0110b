<p>MacKenzie Sigalos, CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenAI and Advanced Micro Devices have reached a deal that could
see Sam Altman’s company take a 10% stake in the chipmaker. AMD
stock skyrocketed more than 30% on Monday following the news.</p>

<p>OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD’s Instinct graphics
processing units over multiple years and across multiple
generations of hardware, the companies said Monday. It will kick
off with an initial 1-gigawatt rollout of chips in the second half
of 2026.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It only happens once a decade or so, but the most exciting times in tech occur when there’s a breakthrough that’s severely hardware constrained. That includes hardware like infrastructure — bandwidth was a massive constraint during the dot-com boom. It wasn’t even feasible to download <em>audio</em>, like podcasts, for the first decade of the consumer internet boom, let alone video. But it was inevitable that we’d get there.</p>

<p>Right now we’re <em>severely</em> constrained on compute for AI. In a few years, we’ll look back on today’s state of affairs the way we look back on dial-up modems.</p>
