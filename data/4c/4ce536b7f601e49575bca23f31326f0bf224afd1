<p>He writes that his department has decided it needs to improve its communication with and visibility to students, the rest of the university, and the surrounding community, and that a greater social media presence is one of several steps they&#8217;re planning on taking to do this. (He notes that his department did at one point have a Facebook account, but that it has long been neglected.)</p>
<p>&#8220;None of [the department faculty] does a lot on social media,&#8221; he says, so &#8220;we have some questions, and we were hoping philosophy professors and students elsewhere could help answer them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are the questions:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><em>What social media platforms would it be best for the department to have account on, if we were limiting ourselves to just two accounts?</em></li>
<li><em>Ideally, should we post the same material on all platforms, or present the material differently depending on the platform, or post about different kinds of things on different platforms? </em></li>
<li><em>What kind of things does your department tend to post on social media?</em></li>
<li><em>Who runs your department&#8217;s social media? Who can post on it? One faculty member? A committee? Students? Who should run it?</em></li>
<li><em>What are some good examples of philosophy departments using social media well?</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Worth considering, as well, are any downsides and difficulties with a department making use of social media.</p>
