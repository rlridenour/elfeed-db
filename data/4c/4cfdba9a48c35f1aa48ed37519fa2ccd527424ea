<p>Via <a href="https://kottke.org/25/09/0047620-12-booker-prize-2025-nomi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Kottke</a>, I learned of a <a href="https://www.wallpaper.com/design-interiors/booker-prize-2025-longlist-writers-desks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent article in <em>Wallpaper</em></a> with photos of the favored writing spaces of a dozen authors longlisted for the 2025 <a href="https://thebookerprizes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Booker Prize</a>. Some write outside on benches, some at desks, at least one at the kitchen table.</p>
<p>How about you? In this post, I invite people to share photos of where they like to write. They can be first-person shots&#8212;the view from where you are now, perhaps&#8212;or photos of the whole set-up, or even selfies, if that works best to convey the environs.</p>
<p>One photo per person. Caption optional. To include a photo in a comment, click on the photo icon in the lower right corner of the comment box.</p>
