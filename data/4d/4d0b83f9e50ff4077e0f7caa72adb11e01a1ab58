<p>One of my original HomePods died last year of a sudden illness. It was survived by its fellow stereo pair. So a friend gave me her own lonely surviving HomePod, and the mismatched couple let the music play on for a little while. But then my other original HomePod died—also suddenly, same symptoms—leaving my friend’s HomePod tragically alone and my back bedroom studio silent.</p>
<p>That’s when another friend recommended <a href="https://nicsfix.com">Nic’s Fix</a>, a one-man operation in the Seattle area that’s devoted to repairing HomePods. I sent my recently deceased HomePod to Nic, who seems to have mastered the disassembly and reassembly of HomePods—it’s tricky stuff!—and has cataloged the entire litany of reasons they die.</p>
<p>Nic fixed my HomePod <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DhLyZpuqq50?si=RsBufL0cv5ue2Tsm&amp;t=12218">live on YouTube</a>, and it’s back in working order, reunited with its stereo pair. He says no HomePod repair exceeds $90, so it seemed like a pretty good deal rather than going out and finding a new pair of smart speakers. Especially since I know that I can fix the other one if it dies, too.</p>
<p>Some other cool things about Nic’s service: He provides a one-year warranty, he’ll clean or even re-color your HomePod’s mesh while he’s at it, and he repairs and replaces obviously worn or tired parts when he spots them. Among others who have used his services are Dan Moren (whose HomePod was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FSvbPeCWA8w?si=Uv_LnIqs9wfIOFt_&amp;t=6390">a victim of Death Farts</a>), John Siracusa (like mine, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/l6p4bWw_oEk?t=1h54m11s">no power</a>), and Steve and Allison Sheridan (<a href="https://www.podfeet.com/blog/2022/11/nics-homepod-repair/">no power</a>). Allison also <a href="https://www.podfeet.com/blog/2022/12/ccatp-753/">interviewed Nic on her podcast</a>.</p>
<p>What can I say? If you have an original HomePod and don’t want to say goodbye, <a href="https://www.podfeet.com/blog/2022/11/nics-homepod-repair/">I recommend Nic’s service</a>.</p>
