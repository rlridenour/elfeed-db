<p>According to a press release from Notre Dame:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The Love and Social Transformation project will bring scholars, writers, nonprofit leaders and others together to advance a framework that captures the power, richness and applicability of the love ethic&#8212;a core component of many faith traditions throughout the world.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Love-based ethical insights have powered some of the most important social movements of the past century, such as Mahatma Gandhi’s Satyagraha movement in India and Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights leadership in the United States. But in the 21st century, the more common approaches to ethical decision-making — especially in policy realms — focus instead on cost-benefit analysis.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“These frameworks neglect the dimensions of life that fit into the rich tradition of virtue ethics — moral touchpoints such as love, dignity and awe,” said Meghan Sullivan, the Wilsey Family College Professor of Philosophy, director of the Institute for Ethics and the Common Good and the Notre Dame Ethics Initiative, and principal investigator for the grant.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“In contrast, the love ethic has three components: It holds that a widespread, non-merit-based trait like dignity is what grounds moral significance for each one of us; it is built around principles that situate interpersonal love at the foundations of our ethical reasoning; and it suggests love-oriented policies on diverse social issues as well as a love-oriented way of life.”</em></p>
<p>The grant is from the <a href="https://www.templeton.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Templeton Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Notre Dame will collaborate with up to 10 other institutions as research partners on this work, and researchers &#8220;will apply the love ethic to a wide range of use cases, including issues of displacement and migration, disability, global philanthropy, political polarization and artificial intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding will support residential fellowships for faculty and graduate students developing the theoretical foundations for the love ethic, fellowships and grants to nonprofit leaders and organizations putting this ethic into practice on pressing social issues, intensive workshops and two global conferences designed to expand the reach of the love ethic, an integrated series of public engagement and storytelling programs that will inspire the broader public imagination about love and ethics, among other things.</p>
