<p>If you want to see the <em>Mona Lisa</em> in real life, your first thought may not be to head to <a href="https://museopradotickets.com/en">the Prado</a>. But according to a school of thought that has emerged in recent years, the&nbsp;<em>Mona Lisa</em> in Madrid has a greater claim to artistic faithfulness than the one in Paris. That’s because <a href="https://www.museodelprado.es/en/learn/research/studies-and-restorations/resource/study-of-the-prado-museums-copy-of-la-gioconda/504eace0-d54e-49b1-a16b-7afd17f756d3">researchers have discovered compelling evidence</a> suggesting that what was long considered just another copy of the most famous painting in the world wasn’t made after Leonardo had completed the original, but concurrently with the original, probably by one of his students. Over half a millennium, in this view, the <a href="https://www.museodelprado.es/en/learn/research/studies-and-restorations/resource/study-of-the-prado-museums-copy-of-la-gioconda/504eace0-d54e-49b1-a16b-7afd17f756d3">Prado’s <em>Mona Lisa</em></a> has retained the colors and details the Louvre’s has lost, resulting in its preservation of Leonardo’s intentions today.</p>
<p>Infrared photography has even revealed, says the narrator of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlWoK0hNrSE">the new <em>Inspiraggio</em> video above</a>, that both paintings “share the same changes in the original sketch. For years, it has been known that Leonardo made small corrections to the shape of the&nbsp;<em>Mona Lisa</em>’s hands, adjustments to the line of the eyes, and subtle modifications to the curve of the face,” the very same corrections that were found in the newly examined copy.</p>

<p>Unlike other copies, the Prado’s version uses “incredibly expensive pigments” such as lapis lazuli—imported from Afghanistan—for the sky. This only became evident during the 2012 restoration, when the background, long hidden under a thick layer of black, was finally uncovered.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the Prado&nbsp;<em>Mona Lisa&nbsp;</em>was exhibited alongside the <em>Mona Lisa</em> at the Louvre in a temporary exhibition. This gave the public the chance to see both how similar they look, and how different. Though undeniably&nbsp;<em>La Gioconda</em>, the copy doesn’t seem quite “right,” in large part because it hasn’t deteriorated in the manner or to the degree of the original. Leonardo painted it on a poplar wood panel that has given way to countless small cracks, and the layers of yellow varnish added over the centuries have darkened to give the whole image a sepia tone. The result, of course, is the texture and coloring we’ve come to associate with the <em>Mona Lisa</em> by ceaseless exposure to her in popular culture, even if we’ve never seen any version hanging in any museum. If the Prado’s copy really does reflect&nbsp;Leonardo’s original artistic choices, we can put at least one hotly debated matter to rest:&nbsp;the lady really did have eyebrows.</p>
