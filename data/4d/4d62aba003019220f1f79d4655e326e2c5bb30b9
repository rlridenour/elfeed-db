<p>New app from Devin Davies, developer of the ADA-winning <a href="https://crouton.app/">Crouton</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cassette is an app for iPhone and iPad that helps you enjoy your
home videos like the good old days. With a retro interface
Cassette auto plays through videos from your devices’ Photo
Library. Mirror your device to a nearby Apple TV for a true kick
back experience.</p>

<p>The VHS retro pastiche is fun, but don’t get the wrong impression from it. Cassette is <em>not</em> an app that makes your modern videos look like they were shot on an old camcorder. (<a href="https://rarevision.com/vhs-camcorder-app/">Rarevision VHS</a> is a fun app for that, if that’s what you’re looking for.)</p>

<p>Cassette’s tape-playing pastiche is more about putting you in the right mindset. Instead of watching one video from your Photos library, or two or three, it mimics popping in a tape labelled, say, “2014” and sitting back and watching an entire hour of videos from a decade ago. It just launched today but I’ve been using the beta via TestFlight for a few weeks, and you really have to try it to see how effective it is. Davies made a nice video teaser to pitch the app. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iQwZ09OIao">It’s good, you should watch it</a>.</p>

<p>The way I’d pitch it is that Cassette is to the videos in your Photos library what the Kodak Carousel was to your 35mm film slides back in the 1960s. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus"><em>Nostalgia</em>. It’s delicate, but potent.</a></p>
