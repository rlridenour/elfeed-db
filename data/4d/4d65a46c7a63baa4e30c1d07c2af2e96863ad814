<p>I <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card">observed yesterday</a> that, in general, Visa and Mastercard credit cards are both accepted at the same locations. The most notable exception is Costco, which, as part of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/visa-wanted-a-vast-empire-first-it-had-to-beat-back-its-foes-3b3067f3?mod=article_inline">the deal to make its own credit card a Visa</a> (after long partnering with Amex), only accepts Visa credit cards at its physical retail locations and gas stations. They accept “most PIN-based debit/ATM cards”, but for credit, only Visa.</p>

<p>Online, for reasons I don’t understand, Costco accepts Mastercard too (which they incorrectly style in camelcase — you’d think Costco, of all companies, would be sensitive to wrongly camelcased mid-name C’s). Also, in Canada’s Costcos, it’s reversed, with Mastercard being exclusive in-store but Visa being accepted online.</p>

<p>Another high-profile exception: <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/visa-on-the-road-to-paris-a-commitment-to-diversity-inspiration-and-community">The Olympics</a>, which “proudly accepts only Visa for card and mobile payments, along with cash”.</p>
