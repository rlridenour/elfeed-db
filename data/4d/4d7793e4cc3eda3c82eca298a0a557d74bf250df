Emacs.  They emulate the out-of-the-box looks of Emacs (which
technically do NOT constitute a theme) while bringing to them thematic
consistency, customizability, and extensibility.  In practice, the
Standard themes take the default style of the font-lock and Org faces,
complement it with a wider and harmonious colour palette, address many
inconsistencies, and apply established semantic patterns across all
interfaces by supporting a large number of packages.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<p>This package is in a stable state. The present release introduces only
tweaks and refinements.</p>

<h2>The built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">erc</code> package is now supported</h2>

<p>This is an IRC client for Emacs that is more feature-rich than its
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rcirc</code> counterpart (also built-in). The colours used in ERC buffers
are now consistest with the rest of theme.</p>

<h2><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ert</code> test results have the appropriate styles</h2>

<p>The built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ert</code> testing framework for Emacs Lisp code displays its
results in a set of colours that are consistent with the rest of the
themes.</p>

<h2>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ztree</code> package is fully supported</h2>

<p>This is a directory viewer that also has the capability to compare the
contents of different directories. The colours it uses now follow the
established patterns of the themes.</p>

<h2>Mu4e folds look a bit different</h2>

<p>The characters used by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mu4e</code> email client to show the tree
structure of message threads are now draws in a less intense colour.
This ensures that the focus in on the message subject lines and
accompanying information.</p>

<h2>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doom-modeline</code> no longer uses bold+italic combinations</h2>

<p>This is because those can clip the edges of icons/symbols used
therein.</p>

<p>I was informed about this problem on the issue tracker of my
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code> by Filippo Argiolas: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/42">https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/42</a>.</p>

<h2>The Elisp shorthands are easier to spot</h2>

<p>This is not a commonly seen feature, though Emacs Lisp can benefit
from so-called “shorthands” were long symbol prefixes are substituted
by a shorter equivalent. At the theme level, we now render those in
italic and in a colour that is not used elsewhere in Elisp code.</p>

<h2>Nerd icon directories are more colourful during completion</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nerd-icons-completion</code> package extends coverage of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nerd-icons</code>
to the minibuffer. File/directory prompts now display directories in
the colour that is also used in Dired buffers instead of black/white.
This makes the themes more consistent and the icons in the minibuffer
less intense.</p>

<h2>Org keywords like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#+title</code> may be monospaced</h2>

<p>If the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">standard-themes-mixed-fonts</code> is set to a non-nil
value, then all such keywords will use a monospaced font (inherit from
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixed-pitch</code>). This is already done for other code- or metadata- like
elements.</p>

<p>The purpose of this user option is to render spacing-sensitive
constructs in a monospaced font but allow the user to set the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">default</code> face to a proportionately spaced font (this can be done on
demand with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x variable-pitch-mode</code>). Without this arrangement,
proportionately spaced fonts will produce misalignments in tables,
code blocks, et cetera.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Extended the coverage of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shr</code> (built-in) faces to cover <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shr-mark</code>.</li>
  <li>Added support for the built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">completions-highlight</code> face (Emacs
29).</li>
  <li>Removed the underline property from the Gnus implicit buttons,
because it can be too distracting.</li>
  <li>Made changes to the manual, were necessary.</li>
</ul>
