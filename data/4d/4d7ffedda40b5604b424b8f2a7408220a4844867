<p>Russia, Ukraine, and the United States opened a second round of U.S.-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, part of renewed diplomatic efforts to end the nearly four-year war. The talks are set to run for two days, but officials and coverage across outlets signaled expectations for a quick breakthrough are low, with territorial questions still at the heart of the dispute. The talks began under the shadow of intensified Russian aerial attacks. Multiple outlets said Ukraine had just endured Russia’s largest strike of the winter, and that the barrage targeted energy infrastructure—prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to urge President Trump to respond and to accuse Moscow of violating an “energy truce” understanding. Russia kept up strikes as the talks got underway, a reminder of how hard it is to negotiate while fighting continues. Even so, the return to a trilateral table keeps a narrow but meaningful channel open for de-escalation, with the UAE offering a place where all sides can meet at once.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Bcd0G0qWUXkYn9bbLB2PHXuAe2sERMwsrqwUTmVd19zhJESg_SGIY4yRwvd3CRvB1W5T1WiLrF61qZGxKAdkWt_sMP_qIRMHvYhvXESzWADmGEPEwRp8lROwh5r0_4IkyElvc-pLDx6pxe35EKnDexphMk_mW5lQ44bVYdwtAbQCGuE3ixcAGq0OsBk3hZeB4SRLjzK_5MTb_K_KiuPOCwSxOcE5k1YZhEesv4eOHvHkST08Phj1SKwl3wsXQaWFJ4qWDnzxiRhnzAYmSw' alt='An apartment building hit by a Russian drone strike in Odesa region, Ukraine, Feb. 4, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Trilateral lineup and timing: RT said the meeting was planned for Sunday but postponed due to a scheduling issue; it also reported the session was expected to be bilateral until U.S. participation was confirmed for Wednesday.</li><li>U.S. envoys: RT said the White House confirmed U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner would take part in the Abu Dhabi session.</li><li>Pre-talk contacts: RT reported Kirill Dmitriev, a member of Russia’s negotiating team, traveled to Florida and met a U.S. delegation ahead of the next planned round, describing the discussions as positive.</li><li>Ukraine posture shift: Euronews said Ukraine planned to adjust its negotiating stance for Abu Dhabi after Russia’s largest strike of the winter targeted civilian energy infrastructure.</li><li>France contacts: The Kremlin confirmed ongoing technical talks with France after President Emmanuel Macron signaled interest in resuming contact with President Vladimir Putin, though the Kremlin did not indicate direct leader-level dialogue.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine (President Volodymyr Zelenskyy): Zelenskyy urged President Trump to respond to Russia’s “massive” aerial attacks and said Moscow violated an “energy truce” promise, arguing Russia used the pause to prepare further strikes.
