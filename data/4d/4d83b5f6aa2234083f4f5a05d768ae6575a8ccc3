<p>Daily notes in separate files, or one big text file? Steph Ango has a way of turning the world (my world, at least) upside down with the simplest of ideas. I’ve said it before—the man is a quiet genius.</p>
<h3 id="learning-from-someone-elses-good-idea">Learning from someone else’s good idea</h3>
<p>This week Steph referred to an article he’s written about how he writes and organised his daily notes. Using Obsidian’s unique note hotkey (see below) he writes one thought per file, rather than writing all the thoughts of the day into a single daily note. One day could potentially have hundreds of notes, differentiated from each other by a time stamp.</p>
<p>I love the way Steph randomly reviews notes and makes connections, and how notes naturally<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>bubble into bigger themes”, or become dormant for a time or even extinct.</p>
<p>As I read his post I was so taken by the idea that I considered throwing in the towel on my One Big Text File (<span class="small-caps">OBTF</span>), and diving back into daily notes! But I’m trying to follow the adage<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Make haste slowly”, to make sure I keep the baby rather than the bathwater, an effort for me, who has been known to do the opposite.</p>
<h3 id="remembering-why-i-started-an-obtf-in-the-first-place">Remembering why I started an <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span> in the first place</h3>
<p>Keeping daily notes in an <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span> was an answer to the feeling that I had too many files, and that potentially important things were easy to lose track of. One place to dump all thoughts, with the opportunity to revisit them and pull out salient points into their own space. I loved it! And still do.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: I rarely review these notes and I’m not sure why.</p>
<p>It’s comforting to know they are there and that I <em>can</em> revisit them, but they aren’t linkable out of the box. I’d have to make time to refactor them into their own spaces, and for some reason I’m just not doing that. Maybe</p>
<p>The way Steph makes his notes feels more useable. And there’s more potential or them to evolve into something truly useful.</p>
<p>Who’d have thought this would be such an existential conundrum?!</p>
<h3 id="arent-daily-notes-and-an-obtf-essentially-the-same-thing">Aren’t daily notes and an <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span> essentially the same thing?</h3>
<p>In many ways Steph’s system is, or could be, the same as mine. In practice, however, there are significant differences. The ability to display a random note and to link to other notes without first having to extract them into an agile format is not something easily done in an <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span>.</p>
<p>I really am conflicted about this <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span> vs multiple notes idea so there’s only one thing to do: use both! There’s no reason for it to be an either-or scenario. Stay tuned for the outcome.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-hotkey-create-uniquely-named-notes-in-obsidian">How to hotkey-create uniquely named notes in Obsidian</h2>
<p>This more-detailed-than-you’d-expect procedure for creating uniquely named notes in Obsidian is here for the benefit of people new to the software as well as for people like me, who have where-are-my-sunglasses-oh-they’re-on-my-head moments.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open Settings (under the Obsidian menu, or press <code>⌘,</code>) and click on <code>Core plugins</code></li>
<li>Scroll to the end of the list</li>
<li>Turn on <code>Unique note creator</code></li>
<li>Click the Settings cog next to the <code>Unique note creator</code> plugin and choose a date format</li>
<li>Go back to the main Settings screen and click on <code>Hotkeys</code></li>
<li>Search for <code>Unique note creator</code> and press the <code>+</code> to create a new hotkey</li>
<li>Press your hotkey and enjoy creating uniquely named notes</li>
</ol>
<p>I kid you not, I had looked at the list of core plugins active in the initial Settings screen, searched in Community plugins, looked it up online, did everything <em>but</em> the thing I need to do to get to where I wanted to be!</p>
<p>Big thanks to everyone on Mastodon who solved the problem without making me feel like I’d asked a stupid question. &lt;3</p>
<p><span class="small-caps">FYI</span> I chose <span class="small-caps">⌘N</span> for my hotkey (re-mapping existing conflicting hotkeys), and <code>yyyy-MM-DD HHmm</code> for the date format. 12-digit unique identifiers (UIDs) are 3 characters shorter, but I prefer having date/time combinations broken up so they’re easier to read at a glance.</p>
