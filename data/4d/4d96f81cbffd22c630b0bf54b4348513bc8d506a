Courtesy of JTR from <a href="https://taonaw.com">The Art Of Not Asking Why</a>, here&rsquo;s a handy tip for <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/05/09/emacs-windows-navigations-and-some.html">dealing with window placement when bringing up a Dired buffer</a>. There are two problems.
</p>
<p>
The first doesn&rsquo;t really concern window placement. Most often JTR wants to bring up a Dired buffer for whatever directory he&rsquo;s already in. The easy way to do that is to use <code>dired-jump</code> (bound to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd>) to open a buffer in the same directory as the current file.
</p>
<p>
The problem with that is that it opens the Dired buffer in the current window. JTR doesn&rsquo;t want that. He wants to open Dired in some other window so that he can see his current file <i>and</i> the Dired buffer. The answer to that is simple: just ask Emacs to open Dired in <i>another</i> window. There&rsquo;s a general protocol for doing that. Simply use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>4</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> to call Dired. That will open Dired in the same directory as the current file but in another window.
</p>
<p>
The <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>4</kbd> &#x2026; works for a lot of commands. I use it to open files or buffers in another window several times a day. I used to consider it an esoteric maneuver but now I use it all the time. You can also open your windows in another frame by using <code>5</code> instead of <code>4</code>.
</p>
<p>
The 4/5 protocol doesn&rsquo;t work for all commands but it does for a lot of them. It&rsquo;s a real time saver that I use repeatedly. It&rsquo;s well worth internalizing.</p>
