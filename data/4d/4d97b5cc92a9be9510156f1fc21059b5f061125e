This is a Christmas communion hymn, titled “A Gift for Us.” I wrote the lyrics last year, and Cheryl Tarter has written some wonderful music for it. It debuts at tonight’s candlelight service at NorthHaven Church. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Into our darkness, there came a light, <br></br>
As a babe was born on that holy night; <br></br>
The angels sang and the shepherds prayed <br></br>
When the Son of God in a manger lay. <br></br></p>

 <p>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember that child, a gift for us. <br></br>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember that child, a gift for us. <br></br></p>

 <p>
The fullness of God in human form, <br></br>
Was that night, in Bethlehem born; <br></br>
Giving up his throne in heaven above, <br></br>
To teach us to serve, to give, and to love. <br></br></p>

 <p>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember Jesus, a gift for us. <br></br>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember Jesus, a gift for us. <br></br></p>

 <p>
He came to this world, in all its strife, <br></br>
For our sins, to give his life; <br></br>
Lifted up, with his arms held wide, <br></br>
The Son of God was crucified. <br></br></p>

 <p>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember our Lord, a gift for us. <br></br>
As we eat this bread and drink this cup, <br></br>
We remember our Lord, a gift for us.
