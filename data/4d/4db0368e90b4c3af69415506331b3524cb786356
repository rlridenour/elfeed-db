I&rsquo;ve written before that one of things I love about Elfeed is that it keeps a database of all your feed entries. That makes it easy to find earlier content if you need to revisit or reference it for some reason. It has an excellent search capability that makes this mostly painless.

Punchagan over at <a href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in">NOETIC NOUGHT</a> has a sobering tale about <a href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/elfeed-db-back-up-hooks/">losing his Elfeed database</a>. He thinks it probably happened during a system crash that occurred at the same time his Elfeed database was being saved. Depending on how you use your feed, that may be more or less disastrous.

If you depend on your feed for research, the loss would be serious. Punchagan uses his Elfeed all the time so he decided to automate the backing up of Elfeed&rsquo;s database. He shows the code in his post so you can take a look. It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward. Whenever a tag changes or a new entry is added, he schedules a database save and backup to Git.

If you&rsquo;re an ordinary user, you may not need such immediate backups. You could for example, schedule a backup once or twice a day so even if you lost the active database the loss would be minimal. On the other hand, if you really depend on your feed, Punchagan&rsquo;s solution may be just what you need.</p>
