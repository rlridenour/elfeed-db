Apple this week stopped selling its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250907182039/https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2G3AM/A/30w-usb-c-power-adapter">30W USB-C Power Adapter</a>, despite its online store indicating that the charger is still included with the base 13-inch MacBook Air and the Apple Vision Pro. It is unclear why the adapter is no longer sold separately.<br/>

Apple released the 30W USB-C Power Adapter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/04/apple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter/">in 2018</a>. It was priced at &#36;39 in the U.S., before being removed from Apple's online store.<br/>
<br/>
In related news, Apple released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-models-faster-usb-c-charging/">40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max</a> this week, in the U.S., Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Perhaps this new 40W-60W charger is the successor to the 30W model.<br/>
<br/>
The new charger can dynamically deliver up to 60W of power, despite having a smaller form factor. However, due to the thermal limitations that come with this compact design, the charger can only reach that 60W peak in shorter bursts.<br/>

Apple also sells a variety of other USB-C power adapters, including <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVV3AM/A/20w-usb-c-power-adapter">20W</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2H3AM/A/35w-dual-usb-c-port-compact-power-adapter">dual-port 35W</a> (in two sizes), <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXN53AM/A/70W%20USB-C%20Power%20Adapter">70W</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2L3AM/A/96w-usb-c-power-adapter">96W</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2M3AM/A/140w-usb-c-power-adapter">140W</a> options.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/12/apple-stops-selling-30w-usb-c-power-adapter/">Apple No Longer Sells 30W Charger Still Included With Two Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-no-longer-sells-30w-charger-still-included-with-two-devices.2465538/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
