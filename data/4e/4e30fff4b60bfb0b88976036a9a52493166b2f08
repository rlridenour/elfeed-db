<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> is just one week away, with Apple's opening keynote <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/apple-announces-wwdc-2025-schedule/">scheduled to begin on Monday, June 9 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time</a>. Ahead of the annual developer conference, Apple updated its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/">WWDC page</a> today with a new "Sleek peek" tagline, which replaces the original "On the horizon" tagline that it used over the past few weeks.<br/>

The graphic for WWDC 2025 has also been updated. It is now a glass-like Apple logo with colors shining through. Until now, it was a glass-like rainbow.<br/>
<br/>
Is the "Sleek peek" tagline a hint at what is to come? It could be a subtle reference to the sleek new look of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26</a>, which are all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">rumored to feature a new glass-like, visionOS-inspired design</a>.<br/>
<br/>
WWDC 2025 was added to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events page</a> today. Apple's keynote will be available to stream on that page, as well as in the Apple TV app, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/">on YouTube</a>. It will also be available for on-demand replay afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Last, Apple's marketing chief Greg Joswiak has <a href="https://x.com/gregjoz/status/1929558230990049758">shared</a> a short WWDC 2025 animation with a glass-like Apple logo, a Swift logo, and a rainbow. For those who are not aware, Swift is a programming language that was introduced by Apple in 2014.<br/>
