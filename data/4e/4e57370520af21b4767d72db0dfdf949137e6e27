<p>While I won&#8217;t be asking you about your new year&#8217;s resolutions, I thought it would be a good idea to hear from you about what you&#8217;d like to see covered and discussed at Daily Nous this coming year.</p>
<p>Are there categories of news you think should be reported on that aren&#8217;t? Are there certain types of posts you&#8217;d like to see (or see more of)? Are there topics or issues that should be posted about and discussed that currently aren&#8217;t (or aren&#8217;t discussed enough)? What do you think the most important topics facing the profession are?</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts on these questions.</p>
<p>Regular posting at Daily Nous will resume next week.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2026/01/02/new-years-greetings-your-suggestions/">New Year’s Greetings & Your Suggestions</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
