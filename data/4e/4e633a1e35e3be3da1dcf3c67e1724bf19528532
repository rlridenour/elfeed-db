<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/flymake-ansible-lint.el">flymake-ansible-lint</a> package provides a Flymake backend for ansible-lint, enabling real-time syntax and style checking for Ansible playbooks and roles within Emacs.</p>
<p><em>(This package can also work with Flycheck: simply use the <code>flymake-flycheck</code> package, which allows any Emacs Flymake backend to function as a Flycheck checker.)</em></p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint">ansible-lint</a> &gt;= 1.0.5</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install <code>flymake-ansible-lint</code> from MELPA:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already done so, <a href="https://melpa.org/#/getting-started">add MELPA repository to your Emacs configuration</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the following code to your Emacs init file to install <code>flymake-ansible-lint</code> from MELPA:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(use-package flymake-ansible-lint
:ensure t
:commands flymake-ansible-lint-setup
:hook (((yaml-ts-mode yaml-mode) . flymake-ansible-lint-setup)
      ((yaml-ts-mode yaml-mode) . flymake-mode)))</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Customizations</h2>
<p>You can configure <code>ansible-lint</code> parameters using the <code>flymake-ansible-lint-args</code> variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(setq flymake-ansible-lint-args '("--offline"
                                  "-x" "run-once[play],no-free-form"))</code></pre>
<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3>Why are some ansible-lint error messages truncated?</h3>
<p>This issue is a known bug in <code>ansible-lint</code>, not in <code>flymake-ansible-lint</code>.</p>
<p>It is <code>ansible-lint</code> that truncates some error messages:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-lint -p test.yaml
test.yaml:5: yaml[truthy]: Truthy value should be one of</code></pre>
<h3>Location of the temporary files created by the flymake-ansible-lint package</h3>
<p>By default, the <em>flymake-ansible-lint</em> package creates temporary files in the same directory as the Ansible YAML file currently being edited.</p>
<p>For example, when editing: <code>/home/user/test/myfile.yaml</code>, the package may generate temporary files such as: <code>/home/user/test/flymake_1_myfile.yaml</code> <code>/home/user/test/flymake_2_myfile.yaml</code>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>These temporary files are automatically removed once flymake-ansible-lint completes its analysis.</strong></p>
<p>(This behavior is controlled by the variable <code>flymake-ansible-lint-tmp-files-enabled</code>. Keeping <code>flymake-ansible-lint-tmp-files-enabled</code> enabled is important because it allows Flymake to lint the most recent in-memory state of the buffer, including unsaved modifications. Without these temporary files, Flymake would have to rely on the last saved version of the file, which might not reflect the current edits. This ensures that linting diagnostics remain accurate, up to date, and synchronized with the actual buffer contents, providing immediate feedback while editing.)</p>
