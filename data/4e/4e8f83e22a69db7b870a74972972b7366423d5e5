In a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/319/">WWDC 2025 session</a> earlier this month, Apple introduced a new API that allows developers of third-party camera apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kino-pro-video-camera/id6472380172">Kino</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/filmic-pro-video-camera/id436577167">Filmic Pro</a> to offer Cinematic mode video recording capabilities in their apps, if they choose to implement it.<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced Cinematic mode on iOS 15, and it is available on all iPhone 13 models and newer. Inspired by Hollywood films, the mode allows users to record video with a shallow depth of field and automatic focus changes between subjects.<br/>
<br/>
Cinematic mode uses a technique called "rack focus" to seamlessly shift the focus from one subject to another. It does this by locking the focus on the subject in a scene and blurring the background to achieve depth of field. If you subsequently move the camera to center on a new subject, or a new subject enters the scene, Cinematic mode automatically switches the focal point to this new subject and blurs out the background.<br/>
<br/>
Since iOS 17, Apple has allowed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/15/ios-17-cinematic-mode-third-party-apps/">Cinematic mode video playback and editing</a> in third-party apps, but the videos had to be recorded in the Camera app first. Now, camera apps on the App Store can offer an all-in-one Cinematic mode recording and editing experience, if they wish to. Watch the session below for more details.<br/>
