</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
It is through epics and poetry that I my home.
</p>
        <p>I’ve been enjoying narrative verse, poetry, myths, and legends.  <time datetime="2026-01-11" title="2026-01-11">Recently</time>, I
finished <cite data-id="isbn-9780763659394">Yvain</cite> by M.T. Anderson.  I felt the thrill of
story and primacy of archetype.  I found the artistic style deeply textured and
enchanting.  It interwove with my reading of <cite data-id="A6B3DC34-C462-46BC-8CD7-D89BDC31D6EB">The Once and Future King</cite> and <cite data-id="DF694105-1DA3-40C9-9F63-EE9BB0E89D8C">The Book of Merlyn</cite>; adding to my personal Arthurian canon.</p>
<p>While perusing a local independent bookstore, I picked up <cite data-id="ISBN-9780316420747">Fierce Fairytales</cite> by Nikita Gill.  <time datetime="2026-02-02" title="2026-02-02">Today</time> I started reading, and
felt the invocation—an echo of Genesis.  From which Gill offers clusters poems
related to a story; each of those poems digging behind the fairy tale to offer
perspective of the characters in the story.</p>
<p>Not to absolve the wicked step-mother, but to walk with her on a path—one of
myriad—that she traversed in donning that mantle.  Or, more correctly, one in
which the mantle was forced upon her by the systems of oppression: poverty and
misogyny.</p>
<p>This lead me to look for additional books by Nikita Gill—I added a few to my
“shopping list.”  Then I stumbled upon an interview with Gill, and learned of
their collaboration with Anoushka Shankar on <cite>Sister Susannah</cite>.</p>
<p>I gave a listen; I very much loved it.  I read more about the song’s origins
(<a href="https://livewire.thewire.in/livewire/sister-susannah-shattering-the-silence-around-abuse/">‘Sister Susannah’: Shattering the Silence Around Abuse</a>).  And then spent time
listening to a few other of Anoushka Shankar’s songs.  Now I’m neck deep in
sitar music; feeling such freshness move through me.  A fresh yet ancient force,
that draws upon the ancient echoes I also heard in <cite data-id="2CC8C24E-8223-4BE8-B47F-84709D6DB2BF">Geek Sublime</cite> by Vikram Chandra.</p>
<p>Years ago, a friend of mine, now since departed, journeyed to England.  His
goal: to see something truly ancient.  He started on a well trod tourist path,
and at the first destination, he took it in and then asked the locals, “Where
might I find something even more ancient?”</p>
<p>They obliged and pointed him down a path.  Upon arrival, he took it in, then
asked these other locals again where to find the ancient.  And they pointed him
further.  He followed the local memory until he arrived at an ancient forge,
here he felt the world of myth touching upon him.</p>
<p>That story hung with me, because of my friend leaning on local memory, one that
could continue to point further back in time.</p>
<p>That is what I feel when I read these epics and retellings; most often in verse.
I feel the author touching on something far older.  And both bringing it forward
in time and transporting me backwards.</p>
<p>This is the magic of <cite data-id="ad1e6319-b4f2-4f00-b94f-1ac0834018ab">The Hobbit</cite>; in which we start in the familiar and
prosaic, then soon find ourselves on an adventure with fairy tale logic.</p>
<p>It is present in Heaney’s <a href="https://www.poetryinternational.com/en/poets-poems/poems/poem/103-23607_THE-TOLLUND-MAN">The Tollund Man</a>.  And in a way Rukeyser’s <a href="https://murielrukeyser.org/2019/12/29/the-soul-and-body-of-john-brown/">The Soul and
Body of John Brown</a>; itself not ancient nor regarding antiquity.  Yet as much a
part of mythology, due to the complexities and nuance of the titular character.</p>
<p>And then there is Borges; one who writes of myth, riddled with lies most true.</p>
