<p><a href="https://fasterandworse.com/the-interface-and-the-potential/" target="_blank">Stephen Farrugia</a> says that using an internet connected device means that, no matter what you’re doing, you are subject to the <em>potential</em> for distraction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer connected to the internet is the embodiment of potential. That connectivity, as potential for distraction, is always ready if you need it. Any challenging activity is haunted by that potential to escape it. —Stephen Farrugia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s why it’s not recommended to have your phone beside your bed at night. Notifications might be turned off but the distraction potential exists even when you’re asleep! (I know this but do it anyway.)</p>
<p>It’s also why some people spend good money on e-readers and paper planners, even though they can already read pretty much anything on their phone/tablet/laptop, and notes and calendar apps come standard on most devices.</p>
<p>Distraction is like a spanner. It can jam up the works, or, used well, it can be a tool for building something worthwhile.</p>
<h3 id="choose-your-distractions-wisely-and-place-limits-on-them">Choose your distractions wisely and place limits on them</h3>
<p>When you know what distracts you, you’re in a good position to start learning to control it.</p>
<p>My best (and most hypocritical) advice to you is to identify today’s three most important tasks and get them done first. The other day I actually did this, and it really did feel like getting a gift from my past self! Highly recommended.</p>
<p>If you want to stop falling into the pit of oh-what-where-did-all-that-time-go, you’ll first need to cultivate some self-awareness. Pay attention to thoughts and feelings that surface just before you abandon the thing you should be doing and allow yourself to fall into that mind-numbing other thing that sucks your time and attention into a pit of future regret.</p>
<p>Insert a pause, look those feelings and thoughts right in the eye, and tell them you’re the boss and won’t take any nonsense until the current Important Thing is done.</p>
<p>Good luck, friend! I’d love to hear about strategies that work for you.</p>

<p>In parting, here’s a fun <a href="https://slowroads.io" target="_blank">zen distraction</a> for people who like driving in the countryside, because sometimes there are things we need distracting from in order to regulate ourselves.</p>
