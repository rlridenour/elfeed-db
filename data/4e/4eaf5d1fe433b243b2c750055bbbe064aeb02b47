<p>Jason Snell, writing at Six Colors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the post-results call with financial analysts, Wamsi Mohan of
Bank of America asked Cook for a little more detail about Apple’s
search revenue, given its lucrative deal with Google, and whether
that revenue growth might decelerate if Google’s search traffic
were to be impacted by the growth of AI. Cook’s response was, if I
do say so myself, an all-timer for these calls:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cook:</strong> This is Tim. The advertising category, which is a
combination of third-party and first-party, did set a record
during the quarter.</p>

<p><strong>Mohan:</strong> Okay, and sorry, just to be clear, both Apple’s own
internal advertising and within the licensing individually set
records?</p>

<p><strong>Cook:</strong> I actually I’m not saying that. I’m just saying that
the combination of the two set a record. We don’t divulge — I’m
dodging the question intentionally because we don’t split it at
that level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look, these calls are almost entirely Apple execs dodging the
questions of fiscal analysts. At least Tim Cook admitted it this
time. <em>You want to know how much Google is paying us and if that’s
growing or shrinking? Well, I’m not gonna tell you!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Apple’s quarterly analyst calls were a podcast, “Dodging the Question Intentionally” would be a great episode title for this one.</p>
