The latest word comes from Taiwanese market research firm TrendForce, which outlined several alleged iPhone 17 details <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20250904-12700.html">in a press release today</a>:<ul><li>As previously rumored, the standard iPhone 17 and the all-new iPhone 17 Air will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-17-and-17-air-120hz-promotion-rumor/">allegedly be equipped with 120Hz displays</a>, for smoother scrolling and content. The regular iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus have 60Hz displays, with a higher 120Hz refresh rate limited to the Pro models to date.</li><br/>
<li>Due to its ultra-thin design, the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a "silicon anode battery," according to the report. A silicon battery would have higher energy density compared to the graphite batteries used in other iPhone models, so this likely refers to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/iphone-17-air-high-density-battery-rumor/">"high-density" battery</a> that Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said the device would have. Still, it was previously reported that the iPhone 17 Air would have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">"worse" battery life</a> compared to other iPhone 17 models, and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">may release an optional battery case</a> for the device.</li><br/>
<li>As widely expected, the iPhone 17 Air is said to rely entirely on eSIM technology, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">no physical SIM card slot</a> due to the device's ultra-thin design.</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models will allegedly have "optimized software algorithms" to "enhance optical zoom" — perhaps the limit will increase from 5× on iPhone 16 Pro models to 8× or higher.</li><br/>
<li>As <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/apple-split-iphone-launch-strategy/">previously rumored</a>, Apple may adjust its release cycle going forward, with lower-end iPhone models to launch in the first half of the year, followed by higher-end models like the Air, Pro, Pro Max, and Fold in the second half of the year. This two-phase strategy is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/base-iphone-18-spring-2027-launch/">expected to begin next year</a>, with the iPhone 18 Air, iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone 18 Fold expected to launch in September 2026, followed by the lower-end iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e models around March 2027.</li></ul>TrendForce also shared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/04/base-iphone-17-pro-cost-200-more-double-storage/">potential iPhone 17 pricing and storage information</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/04/iphone-17-ram-amounts-trendforce/">RAM amounts</a>.<br/>
<br/>
TrendForce said at least some of the information that it shared today is based on "current market information and analyst projections."<br/>
