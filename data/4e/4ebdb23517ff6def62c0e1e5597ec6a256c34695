<p>The United States and Taiwan signed a trade agreement on Thursday aimed at lowering tariff barriers, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative. The deal sets terms for Taiwan’s market access for US goods and for how Taiwanese exports will be treated in the United States. Coverage said the package is tied to sizable Taiwanese commitments to buy US products and includes immediate tariff cuts on a range of US agricultural imports. The pact still needs review by Taiwan’s legislature and lands amid US concerns about supply-chain reliance on Taiwan-made semiconductors, as well as a large goods trade imbalance tied to chip exports.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/zcc7Zwxwpm-uMUDyinTJ0NZyI81eoPp4aJf_YdtmZ-rCzUydAseKPso8QjP0KP0RByBiGE1qH_2_FdUjMuNMjzfbfccRXtqR0I3WosYRG-FIPJ0OatC8SPgwqPmcrCK-IlJJ8pWqwIIlidbS128mGLvS51ioFKsKw9O9lKwOQXDtba2mVJH-PwqwGrZvCzUXmbvzQobtbFHf2mSBjNO8U0vWjDEMMHhjMcQwZuDvlOcpdF8sCsjs0HGvWFvqjK_6FSfO1ZzlGHKZPh4dkQ' alt='Residential areas near the Hsinchu Science Park, in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on Jan. 29.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tariff scope: US officials said Taiwan agreed to remove or reduce 99% of its tariff barriers under the deal.</li><li>Taiwan export tariff: Under the arrangement described in the coverage, Taiwanese exports to the US would face a 15% tariff rate.</li><li>Big purchases: As part of the package described by Al Jazeera, Taipei agreed to buy about US$85 billion of US energy, aircraft and equipment.</li><li>Farm exports: Taiwan will immediately eliminate tariffs of up to 26% on many US agricultural imports, including beef, dairy and corn.</li><li>Trade gap backdrop: Taiwan’s chip exports helped drive a nearly US$127 billion US trade imbalance in the first 11 months of 2025, according to US Census Bureau data cited in coverage.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Office of the US Trade Representative: The US Trade Representative’s office said the agreement would have Taiwan remove or reduce the vast majority of its tariff barriers.
