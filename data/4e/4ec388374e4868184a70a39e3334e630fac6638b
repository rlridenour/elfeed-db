Thinking through #proprietary formats and ownership regarding software and the words I write.

<p>In <a href="https://baty.net/posts/2025/06/monday-june-16-2025/">Monday, June 16, 2025</a>, Jack draws attention to a post by Dave Rogers:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite" cite="https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2025/June_2025.html#note_3033">

<p>We entrust our lives, and the lives of our children to devices we don&rsquo;t
understand. Cars. Airplanes. Elevators. Moving walkways.  Automatic doors.
Fucking Disney rides! Modern conveniences we take for granted without giving
them a second thought.</p>
<p>But our text is so precious that we simply cannot allow it to be entrusted to a
format that we don&rsquo;t &ldquo;own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a symptom of the superiority complex that infects a certain strain of
people who fancy themselves especially technologically adept. Some of these
people are referred to as &ldquo;tech-bros,&rdquo; but the flaw isn&rsquo;t exclusive to one
gender.</p>

<p>Yes we entrust so much to complex systems we don’t understand.  We take them for
granted.  But this is a false flag.</p>
<p>Why?  The issue is around the decision making criteria for selecting to
deploy/own/maintain those systems.  Of the list, cars are the closest analog to
the Markdown decision.  In that when I’m buying a car, one consideration is its
cost of maintenance.</p>
<p>The others, I use, but when they break they aren’t my problem <em>to fix</em> .</p>
<p>Consider ice cream machines, no one would recommend picking the McFlurry
machine.  Because its demonstrated track record of being always broken…because
the repair is complicated due to licensing issues.  Yes, there you can work
around that, but in violation of some of our draconic laws.  I also wouldn’t
recommend going <em>for ice cream</em> to anywhere that uses those machines.</p>
<p>For myself, there’s a choice between a proprietary format and a non-proprietary
format, I err on the side of non-proprietary.  However, that is only one of the
considerations.</p>
<p>The applications we choose and the formats they keep are indicators of access,
today, tomorrow, and years from now.  The utility of plain text files is that
they are accessible and encode some meaning even when the application dies.</p>
<p>I also consider that the source code for applications lives in plain text.
Through compilers and interpreters, we project the plain text into the
commands and functions that are the running application.</p>
<p>That last paragraph is not helping my case of not being part of the “tech-bro”
camp.  However, my writing is a mix of instructions and thoughts.  Instructions
on how I do things (such as multi-step maintenance tasks for appliances).</p>
<p>I’m not a “Plain Text or Die” kind of person, but I’ve done enough data
migrations to know that I’d rather have things in an old boring baseline format.
I have settled on <span><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" title="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-ORG-MODE">&#128214;</a></small>
 as my <em>present</em> format of choice.  It is
plain text and akin to Markdown.</p>
<p>Because the tools that read formats age and die.  And when the proprietary dies,
you’re left with a bunch of rotten bits.  Making the act of reading that
information no longer simple.</p>
<p>Also in having this data in plain text, many other tools that I use become
available.  So for me, plain text is pragmatic in the moment as well as over
time.</p>
<p>Which may not be the use case of other folks.  Other folks might rightly favor
other aspects of applications, as they solve more pressing issues.</p>
<p>And to Dave Rogers point, picking your file format should be some bizarro kind
of flex.  And certainly being an proselytizing evangelist of a format is a bit
bonkers.</p>
<p>My writing is important enough to me that I want to best be able to move it
along with me as I journey through this computering era.  To which plain text is
a strategy to help achieve that goal.</p>
<p>Others may have different goals.  And that’s okay.  Each of us write for
personal reasons, and view the artifacts of our writing through different and
varying criteria.</p>
