<p>Randy Walters wrote a lovely little story, “<a href="https://satori.substack.com/p/christianes-gift">Christiane’s Gift</a>”, originally published back in 2012, about a visit to a Frankfurt museum hosting an exhibit from Stanley Kubrick’s personal archives in 2004. I toured the same exhibit <a href="https://www.thecjm.org/pages/57">at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco in 2016</a>; it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a31Gv0lPlAw">remarkable</a>. Included in the exhibit was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rZTrZwmMJ0">the famed ƒ/0.7 Zeiss lens</a> (designed for use by NASA for satellite photography in space) and the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/04/02/kubricks-lenses">jury-rigged Mitchell BNC camera Kubrick commissioned</a> so he could use that lens to shoot scenes by candlelight in <em>Barry Lyndon</em>.</p>

<p>In the preface to his story, Walters references this quote from Kubrick, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5KHGN76AFE">his acceptance speech</a> for the D.W. Griffith lifetime achievement award from the Director’s Guild of America in 1998:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve compared Griffith’s career to the Icarus myth, but at the
same time I’ve never been certain whether the moral of the Icarus
story should only be, as is generally accepted, “Don’t try to fly
too high,” or whether it might also be thought of as “Forget the
wax and feathers, and do a better job on the wings.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That Zeiss lens/Mitchell BNC was a better job on the wings.</p>
