<p>One of the things that affects my workflow at work and Emacs recently is the source of my tasks and projects.</p>
<p>In the past, I worked almost exclusively with our ticketing system. My capture templates in org-mode contained properties for ticket numbers and user IDs to identify the users. Each task in org-mode I created this way included a scheduled date for that day, which I would move around later, depending on urgency.</p>
<p>This all went away when I moved to a more managerial position about a year ago, but it took me some time to realize that. My new position means that roughly 80% of my projects come from Emails while the rest come from meetings. I almost never have a ticket assigned to me directly, unless it has to do with my old position as a tech writer, which I still do now and then<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Habits die hard, and I was trying to fit email chains and meeting notes into my task templates in org-mode with limited success. For example, I was struggling to figure out what properties I need, since emails don&rsquo;t really point a user with a problem, but often describe a situation that requires a solution.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was <a href="https://taonaw.com/archive/?q=journelly">swapped away by Journelly</a> (and for a good reason) and started to use it in meeting notes, but realized that I tend to keep these notes in a certain manner that would fit nicely into a capture template.  These notes, which consisted mostly of bullet points and questions, did not fit well visually with the rest of the journal. More so, since I often write down things to do in meetings, I needed an indicator to flag those meetings later, when I need to go through the notes and re-write those as tasks<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. This quickly became cumbersome.</p>
<p>For my meetings then, I created this simple template (for more structured templates, I use org files rather than writing them directly into my settings):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp">    <span style="color:#a6e22e">*</span> MEETING %?
    %^T
    
    *Discussion:*
    <span style="color:#a6e22e">-</span>
    
    
    *To Ask:*
    <span style="color:#a6e22e">-</span>  
    
    
    *To Do:*
    <span style="color:#a6e22e">-</span> [ ] 
</code></pre></div><p>I write the points in the meetings as people discuss them. As I listen, I come up with questions/comments which go below (I tend to write the answers as nested items below the questions with a &ldquo;+&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;-&rdquo; to indicate an answer). The To Do part is newer, usually containing large items (projects) that need to be broken down further into dedicated tasks. This is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>As for emails, I still don&rsquo;t have something solid. I mostly rely on my existing project template, but it doesn&rsquo;t fit as nicely as the meeting template above.</p>
<p>Emails in Outlook are usually a mess of &ldquo;conversations&rdquo;  by the time I get to read them. I then need to spend time on reading and understanding what&rsquo;s going on, which is often an issue in itself, as people require urgent answers for complicated matters (Emacs is amazing, but I don&rsquo;t think it can help me with that). I was looking into a way to identify emails by their email ID and use these as properties, but this is something that can only be done on the back end, which I don&rsquo;t have access to. I probably need to spend more time with Outlook and its filters, and that&rsquo;s a mess in itself, as Microsoft tends to change options and controls across its different versions. If anyone reading this has any advice, I&rsquo;m all ears.</p>
<p>Ideally, Emacs projects stemming from emails should contain the email subject or another identifier (ideally in the header itself), then the people involved (the askers and the doers), location, and <em>then</em> resulting ticket numbers for the tasks created - but this is all flexible.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p><sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> : interestingly, my experience writing technical documents is helpful when I need to delegate work or explain a workflows in meetings - and org-mode is one of the best place I ever had to write such documents because it is an outline tool that breaks processes to steps by default.</p>
<p><sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> : For about a week, I used Journelly&rsquo;s tagging system to tag certain notes as meetings, which helped me realize how ridiculous this was. Journelly is a place for me to see pictures of people I spent time with or capture ideas when I get a chance to stop and think a little, often by dictation. Meetings are nothing like these things, and they shouldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s easy for me to write now, clear as day, but a few weeks ago I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
