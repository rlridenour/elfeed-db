  Next month, a new software update will bring lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio to AirPods Max, delivering the ultimate listening experience and even greater performance for music production. With the included USB-C cable, users can enjoy the highest-quality audio across music, movies, and games, while music creators can experience significant enhancements to songwriting, beat making, production, and mixing.

<p>This is the other shoe dropping after the AirPods Max were updated with a USB-C port <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24236804/airpods-max-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date">last year</a>, but without the corresponding USB-C-to-analog jack cable that enabled ultra-low-latency and lossless audio input. (The earlier Lightning model could use a Lightning-to-analog jack to do this.)</p>
<p>Apple says that the included USB-C cable can now be connected to devices for a pure digital lossless experience, and is offering a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MDV84AM/A/usb-c-to-35-mm-audio-cable-12-m">$39 analog-to-USB cable</a> to enable that connection from analog sources. The company also said that a forthcoming software update will enable 24-bit, 48 kHZ lossless audio on AirPods Max.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this is good news for AirPods Max users. On the other hand, it seems a little weird that all of this wasn’t just part of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/apple-introduces-airpods-4-and-a-hearing-health-experience-with-airpods-pro-2/">product announcement back in September</a>.</p>
