<p>A technical malfunction disrupted high-voltage interconnector lines linking Ukraine’s grid with Moldova and Romania on Saturday, triggering widespread blackouts in Ukraine and spilling into neighboring Moldova. Ukrainian officials said protective systems then kicked in and the failure cascaded across the network, compounding the strain on an energy system already damaged by months of Russian strikes on infrastructure. In Kyiv, the outage disrupted everyday essentials: the metro network shut down and water service was interrupted citywide, leaving thousands to navigate winter conditions without normal transport and utilities. Officials in Ukraine and Moldova said crews were working to restore power, with some reporting that electricity in Moldova was brought back after the initial blackout—an early sign that cross-border coordination and grid safeguards can help speed recovery when the system is stressed. Several outlets reported that officials did not attribute the incident to Russian cyberwarfare, framing it instead as a technological or technical failure—an important distinction in a region where power disruptions are often viewed through a security lens.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/NG9CKWu0KqdqorFJy4WY-PosSkGRN-YJu8KPfCTk8zu8Hc9p2CHKAkfc9SuNoWdCyyP1MHkLhqeG39DlYXr_I7gpHsSJQb0get-dJ8K0zpk0Mnaq_Sa4jbf2BsSxd-pHk4caIRvtkuIlgbGoRpWtv5ZXnOX7z6RUK19A6p13z-gKST64wJOPx8FRN6pLGkMhgqdb_TG-pKJCu_N4KHR8BOZILAyjgAlxOR13PjFHwICWiDDOZBwydSlYumkRpsjVol5rJNAMhurRtu9_Aw' alt='People wait in Kyiv for free hot meals amid winter power disruptions.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Metro disruptions: Beyond Kyiv, metro services were also suspended in Kharkiv during the emergency outage response, according to local officials cited by RT.</li><li>Restoration window: Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said power could return within hours, while a Ukrainian parliamentary energy committee member warned restoration might take 24–36 hours in some areas.</li><li>Nuclear balancing: Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said authorities began unloading units at nuclear power plants to help stabilize the grid during the cascading failure.</li><li>Moldova knock-ons: Moldovan officials reported traffic lights failed during the blackout, highlighting how quickly grid problems can disrupt basic city operations.</li><li>Winter pressure: Reports noted the outages hit during frigid winter conditions, increasing the urgency of restoring electricity for heating and other essential services.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine energy authorities: Officials said a technical/technological malfunction on key high-voltage lines triggered automatic protections and a cascading grid failure, and they moved to emergency shutdown schedules to stabilize supply.
