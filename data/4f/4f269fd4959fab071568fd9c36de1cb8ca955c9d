<p>If you use GDB you definitely have to try <a href="https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard">Dashboard package</a> by Andrea Cardaci.</p>
<p>Here is how it looks like:</p>

<p>Looks very nice, it updates itself each time when you <code>step</code> or do another action.
It was confusing why Memory area is empty by default and shows nothing even when I try to <code>x &lt;memory&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>It turned out I have to tell dashboard to watch for particular area of memory. Here is how to do it:</p>
<p><code>dashboard memory watch &lt;addr&gt; &lt;how many bytes&gt;</code></p>
<p>for example:</p>
<p><code>dashboard memory watch $ebp 42</code></p>
<p>Now it looks awesome.</p>
