<p>In the latest development in Iran’s protest crackdown, President Trump said he had been told by “very important sources on the other side” that killings were stopping and that planned executions would not go ahead, while also saying the U.S. had not verified the assurances and he would “watch it and see” on possible military action. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi publicly said there would be “no hanging today or tomorrow” and that he was confident there was no plan for hangings, as Tehran portrayed the situation as under control. Separately, Iran temporarily closed its airspace to most flights before reopening it hours later, while the U.S. and U.K. took precautionary security steps in the region amid warnings from Iran about retaliation if struck.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/2x9LWG1989BXKBNCpdfjFMeuCpo9ar7QEkK9ertXrGyrDO2iy4j8S067Oe8BJ3DZx9c2TZpvG7e9XTB-zht2puOMmN2kcua41EtYMzvfvTZzlZYJJ0_h91A29QzwvMHafO1nOe9VrWpC_ZK3g4qx9jOc9C0NSE19Spkx6Iosw7xSqr2tmL8wlQLtDN0jRoi3_yn_wH8ez8fgOB0P8xB4Jd3-nor1eGGqRLoJeDzebTOcWr-M2cqp95c7Yw' alt='In this photo obtained by The Associated Press, Iranians attend an anti-government protest in Tehran, Iran, Friday, January 9, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Base precautions: The U.S. began withdrawing or advising some personnel to leave key Middle East sites including Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, and the U.K. also withdrew some staff there as a precaution amid heightened tensions.</li><li>Embassy closure: Britain evacuated its ambassador and all embassy staff from Iran and temporarily closed the British Embassy in Tehran, shifting operations to remote support and updating travel advice.</li><li>Regional warnings: A senior Iranian official said Tehran warned neighboring states that U.S. bases in their countries could be targeted if Washington strikes Iran, as Iran also issued public warnings of retaliation.</li><li>Communications blackout: Internet monitoring cited by live coverage indicated Iran’s internet traffic stayed at a tiny fraction of normal levels with widespread disruption, even as limited international phone calling briefly became possible for some users.</li><li>Opposition question: President Trump also cast doubt about whether Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi could marshal enough support inside Iran to take over, despite calling him “very nice”.</li></ul><blockquote>We’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping – it’s stopped – it’s stopping.
