<p>The U.S. House voted 215-215 to defeat a Democratic-backed war powers resolution that would have required President Trump to pull U.S. forces from Venezuela unless Congress authorized their presence. The close outcome highlighted narrow margins in the Republican-led chamber and ongoing congressional debate over how much latitude the White House should have in Venezuela. Supporters said the measure aimed to reassert Congress’s role in authorizing armed conflict, while opponents argued it addressed a scenario they say is not occurring.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qkWbNRn_VNgINn9OKVoI8X0vEGJ2OWYAMBJtOkFwGejFchaCeq2-aAKLSOA88MZILn7wKhqq_r4tDbKPmYYUL12ANhbNIInJ3iur8WVZU9u6t6fjGiTuKc6fbSWsegUmknY4KvRXlZsILEsYGcnb9Ua74VI8k6dQPcQW0W5hKmton0FBFFHm6YRpDbXI4ZX5tHEJV1HuHslNxU5yHnYa9epmHCiTJjmLsYNAfJEr_NJebd683UWBT3VsdIgSAqJiIY6RjZKflzQ16GnB' alt='President Trump meets Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in the Oval Office, Jan. 15, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>What the measure said: The resolution directed the president to remove U.S. armed forces from Venezuela unless Congress provided a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization for force.</li><li>Senate preview: A similar war powers measure in the Senate tied last week, and Vice President JD Vance broke the deadlock.</li><li>Sponsor response: Rep.
