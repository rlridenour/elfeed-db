KDE is a particular desktop for Linux, and by far my favorite. One of the sorest grievances I have in other desktops, like Ubuntu&rsquo;s Unity or Gnome, is the absence of such effective workspace management, like the fully customizable workspace grid. In the picture you see my social media/phone interface in one workspace, my general project list and schedule in the next, another workspace dedicated to the artificial intelligence debugging I&rsquo;m working on with code, debugger, and accessory programs; my active browser for help lookup in another; and the program manual for said project in yet another work space.
