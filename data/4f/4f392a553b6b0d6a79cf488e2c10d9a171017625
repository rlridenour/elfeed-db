T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/benefits/live-translation">today announced</a> a new live translation feature that allows conversations to be translated in real-time when calling someone from any phone on the T-Mobile network.<br/>

Live translation does not require any apps, and it is a free service that T-Mobile is offering in a beta capacity. T-Mobile users can sign up to test live translation on the T-Mobile website, with limited spots available.<br/>
<br/>
The feature works with more than 50 languages, and voice conversations are translated for each speaker "almost instantly." T-Mobile says that users can speak how they normally do on calls, with live translation detecting the languages and voices that are speaking for a natural conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Live translation is built into the T-Mobile network, so it works with any phone on T-Mobile, from iPhones to flip phones. T-Mobile users can even call landlines and get translation capabilities because only one phone connected to the call has to be on T-Mobile for translation to work.<br/>
<br/>
To use live translation, T-Mobile users will need to sign up for the beta. From there, when on a call, pressing * 87 * on the keypad will initiate the live translation process.<br/>
<br/>
Apple rolled out a translation feature for phone calls with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, but T-Mobile's version does not require participants to have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and it covers more languages.<br/>
<br/>
While live translation is free during the beta testing process, there could be a fee associated in the future. T-Mobile has not mentioned what it will cost when the beta ends.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/t-mobile-real-time-call-translation/">T-Mobile Launches Beta for Free Real-Time Call Translation on Any Phone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-launches-beta-for-free-real-time-call-translation-on-any-phone.2477570/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
