<p>While playing around with Swift package manager, it wasn't immediately obvious how to build for iOS from the command line. The default behaviour of invoking <em>swift build</em> is to build for the host. In my case, macOS. In any case, this was it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">swift build -Xswiftc &quot;-sdk&quot; -Xswiftc &quot;/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator13.0.sdk&quot; -Xswiftc &quot;-target&quot; -Xswiftc &quot;x86_64-apple-ios13.0-simulator&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>ps. Can get the SDK path with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path
</code></pre>
