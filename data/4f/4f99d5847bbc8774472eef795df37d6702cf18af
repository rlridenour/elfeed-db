<p>One of my favorite people in the Apple Community is Sal Soghoian, formerly with Apple and now a free-agent automation sensei. One thing a lot of folks don’t know about Sal is that he is a Berklee trained guitarist and ridiculously talented.</p>



<p>Sal has a YouTube channel,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayingTheCoda">Playing the Coda</a>, where he shares some of his music. The trick here is that in nearly all of these tracks he is simultaneously playing the melody and the bass line. At once. On one Guitar. Watch closely. Here’s is George’s Blues.</p>
