<p>Today in my proofs class (MATH 290 at BYU) we talked about the concept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction">induction</a>. I like this, because it sounds a lot like recursion.</p>
<p>On the Wikipedia article, there&rsquo;s an excerpt from a book that illustrates the principle with an analogy using a ladder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mathematical induction proves that we can climb as high as we like on a ladder, by proving that we can climb onto the bottom rung (the basis) and that from each rung we can climb up to the next one (the step).
— <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics">Concrete Mathematics</a></em>, page 3 margins</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with this, however, is that climbing a ladder has side-effects! Namely, when you climb up a step, you get tired. Eventually, there comes a point where you get so tired that you collapse from exhaustion, fall off the ladder and smack into the hard, uncaring ground of reality below.</p>
<p>This will happen to you too if your recursive functions have side effects: you code will be <em>really</em> hard to debug, and eventually, a bug somewhere in the state of your system will deftly shove your process off the call stack to crash on the cold, hard, uncaring silicon below.</p>
