<p>President Trump withdrew Canada’s invitation to join his new “Board of Peace” initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts, reversing an invitation that Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney had been expected to accept. Multiple outlets link the move to rising US-Canada friction after Carney’s Davos remarks criticizing tariffs and warning of a rupture in the US-led rules-based order. The episode adds strain ahead of an expected review of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement later this year, even as both countries remain close allies with deep economic ties.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/k7HPT-2ehGDNNNTzyX-LiDknph2KRsOAeikYFKmF9ZH-rNVrnBOOU3Y2qDPc1vuNdQVyBd4GJQg7N4U-n-ndyXntDIHfOHnyFI3_nnSwBJ9kUKGq9WBl38nailYfZEZk3Cmg5kL6yXQMmhcESfzJH0mKQWgDW3HCkdTuDy-hEC4xDBedOMy4I2M1CjjRwvWyfZVgsRgcfBrdXK-fIVTEt_ZTabJwv-jDP8nCwHLiuRHgsE-v4mMm7ySivfWLzh6fjT4-Qos2sDZTjVGJjA' alt='U.S. President Donald Trump takes part in a charter announcement for his Board of Peace at the World Economic Forum in Davos.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Truth Social letter: Trump announced the reversal via a Truth Social post framed as a letter to Carney, describing the Board of Peace as “the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled”.</li><li>Gaza origins: Politico reports the initiative began as a Gaza-focused governance plan to oversee an end to the war, and the administration later described a broader mission.</li><li>Early participation: The Guardian says leaders of several liberal democracies declined to sign on, while Carney had accepted in principle before Davos.</li><li>Skipped first meeting: The Globe and Mail reports Carney missed the board’s first meeting, adding to the backdrop for Trump’s decision.</li><li>Broader foreign-policy rifts: Politico says Carney has aligned with other NATO allies in opposing Trump’s campaign to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark, highlighting wider strategic differences.</li></ul><blockquote>Canada doesn’t live because of the United States.
