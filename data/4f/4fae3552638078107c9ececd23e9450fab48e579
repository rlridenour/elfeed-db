There have been multiple rumors about a new &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; coming in 2025 with a new A-series processor, but it hasn't been clear which chip Apple would use until now. <br/>
<br/>
The A17 Pro was designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro models, but Apple still makes it for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-7/">iPad mini 7</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K has an A15 Bionic chip, so the upgrade to the A17 Pro will bring substantial performance improvements. The A17 Pro supports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, plus it can run console-quality games with advanced graphics effects. <br/>

Little else is known about the upcoming &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, but it is expected to get an Apple-designed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip. Apple might introduce the new &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; in September alongside new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, but it could also be held until later in 2025. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/">New Apple TV Coming Later This Year With A17 Pro Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip.2463342/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
