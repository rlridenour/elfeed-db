Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/apple-creator-studio-now-available/">launch of Apple Creator Studio</a> this week, Apple has quietly stopped selling its "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260113165155/https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/product/bmge2z/a/pro-apps-bundle-for-education">Pro Apps Bundle for Education</a>" separately, but it remains available with the purchase of a Mac on Apple's Education Store on the web.<br/>

"Pro Apps Bundle for Education" includes one-time-purchase versions of Apple's Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage apps at a steep discount, with U.S. pricing set at &#36;199.99. Purchasing each of the included apps separately costs &#36;629.95, so the bundle provides more than &#36;400 in savings.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has already purchased the bundle separately can continue to use the apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also appears to be cracking down on sharing the apps included in the bundle. According to a <em>MacRumors</em> tipster, sharing the apps with others as a ZIP file no longer works, as the recipient will receive an error when opening the apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Creator Studio is a new subscription bundle that provides access to Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage on the Mac and/or iPad, with U.S. pricing set at &#36;12.99 per month or &#36;129 per year. One-time-purchase versions of all six apps remain available on the Mac for now.<br/>
<br/>
A subscription to Apple Creator Studio also unlocks "intelligent features" and "premium content" in apps like Pixelmator Pro, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and later Freeform.<br/>
<br/>
For college students, Apple Creator Studio costs only &#36;2.99 per month or &#36;29.99 per year.<br/>
