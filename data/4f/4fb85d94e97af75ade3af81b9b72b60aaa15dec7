<p>One way public universities in Utah can earn back part of the $60 million in funding that the state legislature took from their budgets is by &#8220;showing that [the funds] will be reallocated for high-demand and high-wage majors as the state pushes for higher education to be more job-focused,&#8221; according to the <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2025/03/05/everything-we-know-about-utahs-big/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Salt Lake Tribune</em></a>.<span id="more-53894"></span></p>
<p>Because of this, writes, <a href="https://profiles.faculty.utah.edu/u0028752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cynthia Stark</a>, chair of the <a href="https://philosophy.utah.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Philosophy</a> at the University of Utah, in an essay at <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/05/19/how-i-lost-faith-my-universitys-mission-opinion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Inside Higher Ed</em></a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We lost our History and Philosophy of Science major, which drew some of our best students, many of them double majoring in STEM subjects and working toward careers in medicine and public health. To be clear, eliminating this major will reduce opportunities for students while producing no savings whatsoever; offering it requires no additional staff, advisers or courses beyond what is already in place for our philosophy major. </em></p>
<p>The funding cuts, she says, &#8220;also mean that tenure-line faculty in my department will receive a zero percent raise this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the piece she describes some of the other aspects of the &#8220;upheaval&#8221; at the university over the past year:</p>
<ul>
<li>the state legislature&#8217;s passage of an &#8220;anti-DEI&#8221; bill that the university interpreted &#8220;as requiring that the Women’s Resource Center, the Black Cultural Center and the LGBT Resource Center be shuttered&#8221;</li>
<li>the state&#8217;s imposition of a “bathroom bill” requiring trans university students to use locker rooms aligning with their sex assigned at birth</li>
<li>the banning of Pride flags in public spaces and in faculty offices if they can be seen through a window</li>
<li>the state requiring faculty to post their syllabi in a publicly searchable database</li>
<li>the start of the implementation of a plan &#8220;mandating that all students take general education courses on the topics of Western civilization and the rise of Christianity&#8221; that will be rolled out at all public universities in Utah</li>
<li>a new policy, announced by the university president, &#8220;that returned missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will be eligible to receive up to 12 college credits for their service to the church&#8221;</li>
<li>a rash of administrative changes&#8212;a revamped advising system, a consolidation of the university&#8217;s colleges, a plethora of new &#8220;student success initiatives&#8221; &#8212;that have &#8220;imposed a crushing amount of (mostly stultifying) work on deans and department chairs&#8221;.</li>
