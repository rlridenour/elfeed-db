on demand. This is done with the new command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-backlinks-toggle-context</code>. The feature is available as part of
the current development target of Denote (version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.1.0-dev</code>, which I
am actively working on).</p>

<p>Below are a couple of pictures, showing a note that (i) has just
gotten a backlinks buffer with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-backlinks</code> command and (ii)
the user interacts with the backlinks buffer to show/hide the context
of matching links.</p>

<h2>The compact view</h2>

<p>This shows the files that link to the current file, one per line. If a
file has multiple links, it still counts as one on this list.</p>

<h2>The detailed view</h2>

<p>In this presentation, each match is displayed in its context, with a
reference to the line number it is found at. Multiple links in each
file are shown separately and are grouped per file.</p>

<h2>The implementation details may change</h2>

<p>Remember that this is part of the current development version. I might
make further changes to it and I am happy to get your feedback.</p>

<p>Users have long now had the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-backlinks-show-context</code> option to
set their default preference. With current developments, they can
still do what they did, plus toggle the view when the need arises.</p>

<h2>When will version 3.1.0 be released?</h2>

<p>There are no deadlines. Things are in a good state, but I will not
rush to make this happen. To give you a rough idea, expect it some
time in mid to late August.</p>

<h2>About Denote</h2>

<p>Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea
that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming
scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is
about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically
streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to
link between them.</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>
