<blockquote>
  <p>Pixar knew that <em>Elio</em>, an original space adventure, would most
likely struggle in its first weekend at the box office.</p>

<p>Animated movies based on original stories have become harder sells
in theaters, even for the once-unstoppable Pixar. At a time when
streaming services have proliferated and the broader economy is
unsettled, families want assurance that spending the money for
tickets will be worth it.</p>

<p>But the turnout for <em>Elio</em> was worse — much worse — than even
Pixar had expected. The film, which cost at least $250 million to
make and market, collected an estimated $21 million from Thursday
evening through Sunday at theaters in the United States and
Canada, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. It
was Pixar’s worst opening-weekend result ever. The previous bottom
was <em>Elemental</em>, which arrived to $30 million in 2023.</p>

  <p>I wasn’t aware this movie had come out, and still can’t tell you
what it’s about. And I’ve been a Pixar fan since before they made
movies. That seems like a problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hadn’t heard of this movie until today either. Disney and Pixar have a marketing problem. One part of the problem is that Pixar has made some decidedly meh movies in recent years. “Pixar” used to stand for nothing less than excellence. Now it stands for “somewhere in the range of OK to great”. But another is that even when they make a good one — which <em>Elio</em> might be — they suck at getting word out.</p>
