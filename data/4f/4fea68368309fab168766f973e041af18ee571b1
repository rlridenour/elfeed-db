<p>What&#8217;s the funniest number? Yale physicist Emily Pottebaum proposed the Perceived Specificity Hypothesis, which states that &#8220;for nonnegative integers < 100, the funniness of a number increases with its apparent precision." She surveyed 68 acquaintances and found that:



<ul>
<li>Among integers divisible by 10, 0 is funniest.</li>
<li>Odd numbers are consistently funnier than even.</li>
<li>&#8220;Furthermore, the most oddly specific numbers &#8212; odd numbers with a degree of specificity of 2 &#8212; are the most funny, according to the data presented here.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>The degree of specificity characterizes the distance between an integer and the nearest multiple of 5:</p>

<p>So 3, 7, 13, 17, etc. were judged to be funniest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I acknowledge my Ph.D. advisor, who I shall not name out of respect for her academic integrity, for her exasperation upon learning about this study. I thank her for putting up with my antics and plead that she continue to do so until I graduate.&#8221;</p>
