<p>Two Mexican navy ships carrying humanitarian aid entered Havana Harbor on Thursday, bringing supplies to Cuba as the island faces tighter fuel availability and recurring power disruptions. The delivery comes as the United States renews economic pressure. Reports say President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on any country that sells or provides oil to Cuba. Mexico has called for dialogue and said it may send more supplies once the ships return, while carefully managing the diplomatic sensitivities of its relationship with Washington.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/4eIaxsTQp3kCGtcVuGxSShkcfy0pQGSsQF2TdV7ctgU1BXEdQmsyZ51LgYpLAm6WZP7sDn-TSNOVzhEnfyy6pBE2phQ_QQ8oAbV1fnyOep1yKW3DKBlRvgdUM3YU7sw6GF3f-gowNlq-QYc6OB-SmZAZ3YjLMU_6KciY5QfF61rXUdm-1UBvD_Aja_MG0m29T7KmQl_Tu-w1z9Ff9UUw6SukZpDg3RKnYsrLv4zBrpqGLvjB9Wuk8zRUYpsHHsNDcS-eXdBhfqam1Kt5mU-A' alt='Mexican navy ships arrive at the port of Havana with humanitarian aid.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ship details: The Guardian named the vessels as the Isla Holbox and the Papaloapan, saying they docked in Havana on Thursday with humanitarian aid.</li><li>Witness account: A Reuters witness, cited by The Straits Times, saw two Mexican-flagged ships loaded with humanitarian aid enter Havana Harbor early Thursday.</li><li>Timing vs US move: Euronews said the ships arrived about two weeks after Trump threatened tariffs on countries that sell or provide oil to Cuba.</li><li>Mexico’s message: President Claudia Sheinbaum called for dialogue and said Mexico would send more supplies once the ships return home, according to Al Jazeera.</li><li>Promise kept: The Straits Times described the delivery as Mexico following through on a pledge to help Cuba after Washington’s tariff threat tied to oil shipments.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Mexican government (President Claudia Sheinbaum): Sheinbaum called for dialogue and said Mexico would send more supplies after the vessels return to Mexico.
