Apple will be permanently closing a retail store in China next month, but it is also in the process of opening several new stores around the world.<br/>

As reported <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3319861/apple-shuts-dalian-store-huawei-tops-mainland-chinas-smartphone-market">by the <em>South China Morning Post</em></a> today, Apple Parkland in Dalian, China will be closing on Saturday, August 9 at 8 p.m. local time, according to the <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/retail/parkland/">store's listing</a> on Apple's website. This is a permanent store closure, rather than a relocation.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement shared with <em>MacRumors</em> today, Apple said that it decided to close the store because the Parkland shopping mall (recently rebranded as Intime City) has lost several retailers. Apple confirmed that all affected employees at the store will have the opportunity to continue to work for the company going forward. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's full statement:<blockquote>At Apple, we're always focused on providing an exceptional experience for all of our customers both online and at more than 50 Apple Store locations across Greater China. Given the departure of several retailers at the Parkland Mall, we have made the decision to close our store there on August 9, 2025. We love serving the Dalian community, and all of our valued team members will have the opportunity to continue their roles with Apple. We look forward to welcoming customers at our nearby Olympia 66 store, as well as on Apple.com and the Apple Store app.</blockquote>According to a source familiar with the matter, the mall's landlord has been facing <a href="https://www.lejucaijing.com/news-6902858810210434506.html">financial struggles</a> and litigation for several years, leading to the mall's majority shareholder assuming full control of leasing and operations earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
Other retailers that have departed the mall include Coach, Hugo Boss, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, UGG, and others, the source said.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has more than 50 other stores across Greater China, and its all-new <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/retail/uniwalkqianhai/">Uniwalk Qianhai store</a> in Shenzhen opens on August 16. <br/>
<br/>
