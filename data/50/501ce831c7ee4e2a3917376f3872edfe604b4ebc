  <p>Apple offers a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/apple-announces-airtag-location-sharing/">Share Item Location feature in the Find My
app</a> that allows you to temporarily share the location of an
AirTag-equipped item with others, including employees at
participating airlines. This way, if you put an AirTag inside your
bags, the airline can better help you find them in the event they
are lost or delayed at the airport. [...] Below, we have listed
most of the airlines that support the feature.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/apple-introduces-new-airtag-with-expanded-range-and-improved-findability/">Apple’s announcement</a> claims that 36 airlines support it today, and 15 more are coming soon.</p>
