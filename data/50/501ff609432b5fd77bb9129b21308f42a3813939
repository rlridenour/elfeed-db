<p>The United States, working with Russian interlocutors, has circulated a 28-point framework that would require Ukraine to cede territory and curb its military; Kyiv says it was not involved in drafting the proposal and reacted negatively. The plan is said to have been drafted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian businessman Kirill Dmitriev and delivered to Ukrainian leaders after talks between the two men. The White House is pressing Kyiv to consider the framework while the U.S. Army secretary visited Kyiv as part of renewed diplomatic outreach. Separately, Russian missile and drone strikes hit the western city of Ternopil as reports of the plan emerged, killing civilians and prompting emergency response there.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/KgTwCL1Ja18W4HcO-mNcACPLSEkl_RSFspunNVJefBJI7iWqpOhkFBRwRkLNmRVjp45Dwsb59gto3LXfty5rqaYySSFVHbFEb0-e4w2NEc_vB6-hgIbbHfBgoFzC-TVmxEOroV3BZHTx2_GNfJQut0dEx-1yr-vX_T3STv2aZnMKgL77MXyWiLmRVaLfsvgWj8XJSZL_JaI1opxqM8v7yW2hqo-P9P4SlrdRIlLWPvwKufFnevZYNQvYisWNFfFX4nrbMm_J4WVTnGe6dg' alt='Rescue workers put out a fire at a residential building damaged by a Russian strike in Ternopil, Nov. 19, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Secret back channel: Steve Witkoff and Kirill Dmitriev conducted direct talks — reportedly meeting in Miami last month — to draft the 28-point framework, a development detailed by U.S. and foreign reporting</li><li>Specific military terms: Sources say the framework would sharply reduce Ukraine&#x27;s armed forces and bar some long-range weapons, with one report citing a proposed ceiling near 400,000 personnel</li><li>Allies alarmed: European and other U.S. partners expressed surprise and concern as officials scrambled for clarity on whether Washington formally backed the plan and how NATO&#x27;s role would be mentioned</li><li>Market reaction: News of renewed U.S. efforts to end the war coincided with a sharp rise in Ukrainian government bond prices, the largest jump in months according to market reports</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukrainian government: Kyiv said it was not part of the plan’s drafting process and officials reacted negatively to terms seen as tilted toward Moscow.
