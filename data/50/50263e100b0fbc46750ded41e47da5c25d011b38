<p>Malaysia’s transport ministry has announced that the deep-sea search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 will restart on 30 December 2025 in the southern Indian Ocean, more than eleven years after the jet disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The government has asked maritime exploration company Ocean Infinity to conduct an intermittent 55‑day underwater mission in a specific area assessed by experts as having the highest likelihood of containing the aircraft wreckage. The operation will continue under a &quot;no find, no fee&quot; arrangement, meaning Ocean Infinity will only be paid—up to about $70 million—if it successfully locates the plane, a structure designed to limit public cost while encouraging an intensive search effort. Officials say resuming the search reflects a renewed commitment to providing answers and potential closure to families from multiple countries who have waited more than a decade for explanations about one of aviation’s most enduring mysteries.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/U_PTVTZ1uW0JGdsYT070VUWU45RPJIUdJPoiyO89Bwc786NcTCXhybluNFKDhmEc_gjjrkC3-ZlbUmK5M0CCt7Mp1r2LmruZN0MqjVV6Tkqj' alt='Malaysia Airlines aircraft taxi at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in 2014, the year Flight MH370 disappeared.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Search area focus: Authorities say the new mission will concentrate on a refined sector of the southern Indian Ocean identified through updated drift analysis and seabed mapping as the most promising zone for finding MH370’s main wreckage.</li><li>Seasonal timing: Malaysia paused an earlier 2025 effort in the same broad region because conditions were entering an unfavorable weather season for safe and effective deep‑sea work, and scheduled this restart for late December when seas are expected to be calmer.</li><li>Previous search scale: The original Australia‑led hunt swept roughly 120,000 square kilometers of seafloor over nearly three years, recovering only scattered debris such as wing fragments that later washed ashore on western Indian Ocean coastlines.</li><li>Contract terms: Under the renewed proposal, Ocean Infinity’s payment is tied to clearly defined performance milestones, with the largest tranche due only if investigators can positively identify the aircraft’s location and deliver sufficient data to support an official accident report.</li><li>Families’ expectations: Relatives’ groups, particularly in Malaysia and China, have campaigned for years for authorities to relaunch a technically advanced search, expressing cautious hope that improved undersea robotics and refined models will finally produce conclusive evidence of what happened to the flight.</li></ul><blockquote>We owe it to the next-of-kin and we owe it to the flying public to find out what happened to MH370 - Anthony Loke</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Malaysian transport ministry: Officials said resuming operations shows the government remains committed to pursuing every credible lead and will support the mission with technical experts and data-sharing to maximize the chances of success.
