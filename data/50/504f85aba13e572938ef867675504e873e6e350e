There have been a couple of times in the last few months when I've been asking a question in either a forum or a chat room, and the first (or only) response I get is AI generated. Not even in the sense of a bot replying entirely to the comment, but something to the effect of -
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I asked ChatGPT and it said &#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My immediate response to this is to block whoever it was who answered in this way. I don't care if the answer was correct or apt. This is a matter of principle; if I wanted a response written by the chatbot, I would have just asked the chatbot. It's free.
