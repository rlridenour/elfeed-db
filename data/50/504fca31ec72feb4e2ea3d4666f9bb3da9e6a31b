<p>Filipe Espósito, in a scoop for 9to5Mac all the way back in October:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>9to5Mac has learned details about the new project from reliable
sources familiar with the matter. The new app combines
functionality from the App Store and Game Center in one place. The
gaming app is not expected to replace Game Center. In fact, it
will integrate with the user’s Game Center profile.</p>

<p>According to our sources, the app will have multiple tabs,
including a “Play Now” tab, a tab for the user’s games, friends,
and more. In Play Now, users will find editorial content and game
suggestions. The app will also show things like challenges,
leaderboards, and achievements. Games from both the App Store and
Apple Arcade will be featured in the new store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even before <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/27/ios-19-gaming-app/">Mark Gurman corroborated this report</a> last week, I’ve had a spitball theory about what it might mean. Perhaps this is about more than having one app (Games) for finding and installing games, and another (App Store) for finding and installing apps. It could signal that Apple is poised to establish different policies for apps and games. Like, what if games still use the longstanding 70/30 commission split (with small business developers getting 85/15), but non-game apps get a new reduced rate? Say, 80/20 or even 85/15 right off the top, with small business developers and second-year subscriptions going to 90/10?</p>

<p>Having separate store apps for apps and games would help establish the idea that games and apps are two entirely different markets. Thus: two different stores?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://spyglass.org/apple-gaming-app-store/">MG Siegler offered the same spitball</a> — back on May 28. Great minds think alike.</p>
