It seems there are some references to the original movie (which I haven't watched yet) that I missed, or perhaps some jokes for Broadway goers.</p><p>Having something on stage like this means there's something happening everywhere all the time, and the stage for the show - the CBS newsroom - is an excellent example to demonstrate this. A movie tends to be too focused; if not by design, then by the viewers, who are used to being led by the eyeballs to the action.</p><p>This is also perhaps another subtle point that came to mind while I watched: media outlets, such as this show, are an art in leading an audience to see what the directors want us to see, which in turn is what Clooney delivers from his soapbox, which he does very well.</p><p>I say a soapbox because the end of this show (which is not included in the original film), though powerful, is unnecessary. By spoon-feeding us the point, I believe Clooney takes away from the moral of the real story - that of Edward Murrow - and his own, in the show, which otherwise he delivers brilliantly.</p>
