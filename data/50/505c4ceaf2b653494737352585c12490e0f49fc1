  <p>Bloomberg has just released <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-06-16/why-tesla-could-have-a-self-driving-advantage-video">an embarrassingly bad report</a>
about the self-driving space, in which it claimed Tesla has an
advantage over Waymo by misrepresenting data. [...] The report
compares Tesla’s and Waymo’s self-driving efforts, going so far as
to claim that “Tesla is closer to vehicle autonomy than peers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right off the bat this smells fishy, given that Waymo is actually operating self-driving taxis in several cities, and Tesla ... is not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Steve Man, the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst behind the report,
based his report on Tesla’s own quarterly misleading “Autopilot
Safety Report.” The report is widely considered to be unserious
for several main reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tesla bundles all miles from its vehicles using Autopilot and
FSD technology, which are considered level 2 ADAS systems that
require driver attention at all times. Drivers consistently
correct the systems to avoid accidents.</li>
<li>Tesla Autopilot, which is standard on all Tesla vehicles, is
primarily used on highways, where accidents occur at a
significantly lower rate per mile compared to city driving.</li>
<li>Tesla only counts events that deploy an airbag or a seat-belt
pretensioner. Fender-benders, curb strikes, and many ADAS
incidents never appear, keeping crash counts artificially low.</li>
<li>Finally, Tesla’s handpicked data is compared to NHTSA’s much
broader statistics that include all collision events, including
minor fender benders.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Trusting Tesla’s own safety report is like saying, “Elon Musk says Tesla is ahead, so they must be ahead.”</p>
