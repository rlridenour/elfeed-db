An independent engineer known for modifying Apple products today revealed a new accessory that adds a fully functional USB-C port to older iPhones with Lightning ports via a custom-designed case.<br/>

<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ken-pillonel/">Ken Pillonel</a>, the Swiss robotics engineer who gained attention in 2021 after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/iphone-x-modded-usb-c-port/">adding a USB-C port to an iPhone X</a> through hardware modification, has launched a commercial product that enables USB-C charging and data transfer on Lightning-based iPhones without requiring any internal modifications.<br/>
<br/>
The accessory, sold under the brand "<a href="http://obsoless.com">Obsoless</a>," is a two-part snap-on case that integrates a custom circuit board and USB-C connector. The product is designed to provide full compatibility with 9V fast charging, data transfer, and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The project is built on the foundations of his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/10/usb-c-airpods-mod/">earlier work</a> with AirPods USB-C cases. In a new video, Pillonel explains how he overcame many of the technical challenges involved in developing the case, such as ensuring compatibility with fast charging. <br/>

<br/>
The case itself consists of two parts that clamp around the phone, connecting to the Lightning port through a precisely aligned connector embedded within the enclosure. Pillonel developed a custom latching mechanism inspired by pen clickers and belt buckles, which uses a rotating joint and tactile latch to keep the enclosure closed without requiring tools. <br/>
<br/>
The accessory is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> compatible. 20 different <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models with Lightning ports are supported in total. More color variants of the case will be available starting in September, and users can sign up for email notifications via the <a href="http://obsoless.com">Obsoless website</a> for updates on availability. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ken-pillonel/">Ken Pillonel</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lightning/">Lightning</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/">USB-C</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c-iphone/">USB-C iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/23/case-brings-usb-c-port-to-lightning-iphones/">New Case Brings USB-C Port to Lightning iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-case-brings-usb-c-port-to-lightning-iphones.2462073/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
