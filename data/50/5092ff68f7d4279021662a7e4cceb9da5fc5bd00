Repo Bug-Report Template magit-version: Magit v3.3.0-402-gacd26dd9, Git 2.36.1, Emacs 28.1, gnu/linux
(1) what behavior you expected When I use a transient with
:transient-non-suffix &#39;transient--do-quit-one :transient-suffix &#39;transient--do-stay I expect to be able to continue using transient commands regardless of what buffer-switches are occurring above the transient.
(2) what behavior you observed After executing a buffer-switching command within my transient, such as find-file, the transient remains visible but no longer has focus and cannot be used/switched to.
