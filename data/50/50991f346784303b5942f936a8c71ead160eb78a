<p>Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said he agreed with Crown Princess Mette-Marit’s own assessment that she showed “poor judgement” over her past contacts with the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after newly unsealed US documents brought fresh attention to the relationship. The disclosures have put Norway’s royal household under renewed scrutiny, with multiple outlets reporting her name appears around 1,000 times in the newly released material. Several reports describe the documents as indicating years of contact, including what The Guardian characterises as numerous email exchanges. The timing adds to the pressure on the palace because her 29-year-old son is due to go on trial on Tuesday on charges including rape, assault and drug offences, according to Le Monde and SCMP. While the story is uncomfortable for Norway’s monarchy, it also underscores a constructive civic dynamic: public accountability. The crown princess’s apology and the prime minister’s public response show Norway’s leaders addressing reputational issues directly rather than ignoring them.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/FF4JlEnRAK0tXSSjNobbCgXgRG_OhdXY5i19DebohdqR7AhJyuRFnk7udZ01qZtwospSUwybfFwk9RNg6vVipfMLcpf_lI2Or9k4C1WqXtGVzgY7eR-PZ8i9vNTUFyOTpAUZxOf0sD56ixTSa2lgTjnc4c4oraUI1gu4L4Ta04tAuJI' alt='Crown Princess Mette-Marit greets the children&#x27;s parade during Norway’s May 17 celebrations at Skaugum (May 17, 2024).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>US file release: The newly unsealed tranche was released by the US Department of Justice on Friday, according to reporting on the documents.</li><li>Royal succession: Some coverage says the episode has prompted public questions about whether Mette-Marit could still one day become queen.</li><li>Commoner background: Mette-Marit is described as a commoner who married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001, a detail raised in coverage as the latest attention falls on her role.</li><li>Palace timing: Le Monde notes the palace faces this scrutiny just as her son’s criminal trial is set to begin, creating a compounded reputational challenge.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre: He said he agreed with the crown princess’s own remarks that her Epstein contacts reflected “poor judgement,” according to the BBC’s reporting of his comments.
