<p>Mark Zuckerberg, concluding a 600-word essay ostentatiously typeset in the style of web pages circa 1994<sup>*</sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meta believes strongly in building personal superintelligence that
empowers everyone. We have the resources and the expertise to
build the massive infrastructure required, and the capability and
will to deliver new technology to billions of people across our
products. I’m excited to focus Meta’s efforts towards building
this future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What about the metaverse? Wasn’t that the thing? What Zuckerberg, and thus Meta, actually believe strongly in is jumping on whatever trend becomes a hype bubble. The company’s soul is empty.</p>

<p><small>* Actual web pages from 1994 didn’t include nearly a megabyte of JavaScript to display 3 kilobytes of text.</small></p>
