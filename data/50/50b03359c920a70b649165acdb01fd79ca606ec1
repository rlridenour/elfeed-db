<blockquote>
  <p>Me looking at Vibes feed: this is screensaver. So boring. Why
would anyone want it?</p>

<p>Me looking at videos I made of my own face in Sora 2: heheh I love
this it’s funny it’s ME.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My feelings exactly.</p>

<p>I even like staring at screensavers sometimes. But the screensavers I like watching are Apple’s aerial (and occasionally, underwater) screensavers on Apple TV. They’re slow, peaceful, and real. Vibes is chaotic, fast, and phony.</p>
