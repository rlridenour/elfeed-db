This year, I continued my journey through computer science by learning functional programming. I started using functional programming (FP) through emacs lisp, then scheme with the SICP book, until I discovered Haskell, which is arguably the best language to learn FP concepts. There I discovered software designs that provide elegant solutions to some of the problems my team and I are facing.
