Apple today seeded the release candidate (RC) versions of upcoming iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-releases-ios-26-3-beta-3/">release of the third betas</a>. The RCs represent the final versions of iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 that will be provided to the public if no bugs are found in the updates.  <br/>

Registered developers can download the updates from the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> by going to the General section and selecting the Software Update option.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26.3 adds a tool for transitioning from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to an Android device. Transfers can be initiated during the device setup process, and moving data from one device to another can now be done without having to download a specific app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's transfer process supports moving photos, messages, notes, apps, passwords, phone number, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The update also includes a Notification Forwarding setting for third-party wearables in the European Union, and there are some minor changes to the Weather wallpaper. More information on what's changed can be found in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/ios-26-3-beta-1-features/">iOS 26.3 beta feature list</a>.<br/>

With the RC now available, Apple will likely release iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 next week. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-seeds-ios-26-3-rc/">Apple Seeds iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 Release Candidates</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-ios-26-3-and-ipados-26-3-release-candidates.2477166/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
