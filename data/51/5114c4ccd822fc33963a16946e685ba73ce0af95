<p>Juli Clover, writing at MacRumors (regarding a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/eu-court-rules-dutch-courts-can-handle-anti-trust-case-against-apples-app-store-2025-12-02/">report at Reuters</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple could ultimately have to pay up to an estimated 637 million
euros to address the damage suffered by 14 million iPhone and iPad
users in the Netherlands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s about €45/user.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lawsuit dates back to 2022, when two Dutch consumer
foundations (Right to Consumer Justice and App Store Claims)
accused Apple of abusing its dominant market position and charging
developers excessive fees. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of
Dutch iPhone and iPad users, and it claimed that Apple’s 30
percent commission inflated prices for apps and in-app purchases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m curious what these consumer foundations would consider a “fair” (and thus legal) commission rate.</p>

<p>This all comes back to the argument that Apple’s App Store commission inflates prices. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/files/DMA-Study-Nov-2025.pdf">A recent Apple-funded (and Apple-promoted) study</a> suggests this is not true — that with lower commissions mandated by the DMA, prices paid by consumers stayed the same and the difference went to the developers. That’s <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-dma-commission-study/">good if you’re a developer</a>, but it’s not the argument being made by these consumer advocate groups.</p>

<p>That said, <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-dma-commission-study/">I pointed out just the other day</a> that Tiimo, a to-do app that Apple just named as the iPhone app of the year in the 2025 App Awards, charges about 20 percent less for subscriptions on its website compared to its in-app subscriptions. An Apple-funded, Apple-promoted study showing that the App Store’s commissions don’t raise prices ought to be taken with a few grains of salt.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple argued that the Dutch court did not have jurisdiction to
hear the case because the EU App Store is run from Ireland, and
therefore the claims should be litigated in Ireland. Apple said
that if the Dutch court was able to hear the case, it could lead
to fragmentation with multiple similar cases across the EU, plus
it argued that customers in the Netherlands could have downloaded
apps while in other EU member states.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know Apple wants this litigated in Ireland because the Irish government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%27s_EU_tax_dispute">sees Apple as an ally, not an adversary</a>, but it does seem contrary to the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_single_market">a single market</a> if a company doing business in the EU is subject to different antitrust laws from each of the EU’s 27 member states.</p>
