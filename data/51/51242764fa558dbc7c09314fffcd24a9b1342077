F1 is set to be released on June 27, and it is based on the Formula One World Championship. The movie stars Brad Pitt as Sonny Hayes, a Formula One driver who is in a terrible crash that forces him to retire. He returns to racing as a mentor for hotshot rookie Joshua "Noah" Pearce, played by Damson Idris.<br/>
<br/>
The film will also feature the 10 Formula One teams in the 2023 season and their drivers, including Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso, and Charles Leclerc.<br/>
<br/>
Apple and distribution partner Warner Bros. Pictures have been heavily promoting F1, and it has seen more promotion than any other &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ movie. Apple has been running ads on YouTube and on social media, and Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Brad Pitt were at Apple's flagship Fifth Avenue Store in New York to highlight the movie. Apple also added a guide to the Maps app that features well-known F1 racetracks, and Craig Federighi promoted the movie by driving a race car around <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> in Apple's WWDC opening video.<br/>
<br/>
Formula One offered a unique advanced screening event, and some theaters <a href="https://www.regmovies.com/promotions/f1">are offering</a> special F1 helmet popcorn buckets and themed drinks. Mercedes plans to sell a limited-edition AMG GT63 APXGP Edition road car from the film, with colors to match the fictional movie team's colors. EA Sports is adding movie-inspired gameplay chapters to its F1 25 video game, and luxury watch company IWC has released a &#36;7,000 Pilot's Watch Chronograph APXGP (the team from the movie) inspired by the movie. Shark/Ninja released a whole line of appliances using the black and gold color scheme from the movie.<br/>
<br/>
At the Met Gala, Tommy Hilfiger dressed F1 star Damson Idris in a tear-away fire suit featuring the APXGP team, which he ripped off to debut a Tommy Hilfiger Tuxedo. The reveal was popular on social media. Marriott is sending members offers for a premiere event in New York City, and Heineken is an official partner of the movie and is running ads promoting it.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also detailed how the movie was filmed using the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Apple's engineering team created a custom camera module using &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; components that was meant to be mounted on Formula 1 cars during actual races. The special camera was designed to withstand extreme speeds and conditions while capturing racing footage for the film.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the reason why F1: The Movie is seeing such heavy promotion is because it features significant brand placement because F1 is a sponsor-heavy sport. Some of the companies that are appearing in the film include KFC, EA Sports, IWC, Mercedes, Geico, Marriott, Expensify, MSC Cruises, Tommy Hilfiger, Shark/Ninja, and Heineken.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/18/f1-movie-ticket-discounts/">Apple Partners With Fandango For &#039;F1: The Movie&#039; Ticket Discount</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-partners-with-fandango-for-f1-the-movie-ticket-discount.2459267/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
