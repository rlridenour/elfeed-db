<p id="p2">It&rsquo;s time for another update to <a href="https://www.macstories.net/setups/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the MacStories Setups page</a>, where you&rsquo;ll find all the gear and apps that Federico and I use for work and play. With Prime Day upon us, it&rsquo;s a great time to revisit our setups and see what&rsquo;s on sale. Plus, there&rsquo;s a handy changelog at the top of the page for those of you who are only interested in what&rsquo;s new. If you want to hear more about what drove the latest changes to our setups, we&rsquo;ll be discussing them in more detail on this week&rsquo;s episode of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/unwind/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacStories Unwind</a>, too.</p>

<p id="p4">It&rsquo;s been a little while since we last heard from Federico about his setup, which took a recent turn with the developer beta of iPadOS 26. The iPad Pro is back at the center of Federico&rsquo;s workflow, but he&rsquo;s been able to keep everything as streamlined as ever with the help of his <a href="https://amzn.to/3Gx0agy" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASUS ROG PG27UCDM monitor</a> that features a built-in KVM switch. That display lets him easily switch between the iPad, an M4 Max Mac Studio, his custom-built gaming PC, and the Nintendo Switch 2. When he&rsquo;s not at his work and gaming monitor, Federico has the latest <a href="https://amzn.to/4kIUO01" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viture Pro XR glasses</a> that serve as a USB-C connected external display.</p>
<p id="p5">One highlight of both of our setup updates is the <a href="https://amzn.to/44APINi" rel="noopener noreferrer">TP-Link WiFi 7 Deco BE85 routers</a>. Federico got a two-pack, and I have a three-pack, thanks to my three-story condo. Home Wi-Fi 7 mesh networks are still on the expensive side, but they are much faster than Wi-Fi 6 and 6E in my experience, and the models that Federico and I each installed earlier this year are discounted during Prime Day.</p>

<p id="p7">My setup has been simplified a bit with my latest update. I&rsquo;m carrying a smaller tomtoc bag when I&rsquo;m away from home (which I&rsquo;ve been loving), I upgraded my travel router to Wi-Fi 7 with the <a href="https://amzn.to/4lHuPqz" rel="noopener noreferrer">GL.iNet GL-BE3600 (Slate 7) Portable Travel Router</a>, and I&rsquo;m a big fan of the compact elegance of the <a href="https://amzn.to/4krhvp9" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOFT Invisible Laptop Stand</a> that <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/now-you-see-it-now-you-dont-a-review-of-the-moft-invisible-stand/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I reviewed earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p id="p8">At my desk, I swapped a Belkin AirPlay 2 receiver for the more powerful <a href="https://amzn.to/44BkMwa" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arylic LP10 AirPlay 2 Wireless Music Streamer</a>, which drives my Harmon Kardon SoundSticks III speakers. I also replaced a pair of broken podcasting headphones with the inexpensive but very comfortable <a href="https://amzn.to/3GzMRfn" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCZ Yinyoo Melody In Ear Monitors</a>. And I recently started using the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Gxw6kX" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kensington SD5000T5 Thunderbolt 5 Docking Station</a> to expand my Mac Studio&rsquo;s peripheral options.</p>
<p id="p9">Finally, you&rsquo;ll notice I&rsquo;ve trimmed down my handheld console setup. There&rsquo;s still a lot there, but I&rsquo;ve been focused on flip-style handhelds and picking a favorite of each form factor instead of jumping endlessly from one handheld to the next. With this update, the big additions are the <a href="https://amzn.to/3GcSUGL" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a> and the <a href="https://amzn.to/4eDr9Uu" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miyoo Flip</a>.</p>
<p id="p10">Both of us have added other apps and gear, too, so be sure to browse through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macstories.net/setups/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Setups page</a>&nbsp;to find the complete listing of our current setups.</p>
