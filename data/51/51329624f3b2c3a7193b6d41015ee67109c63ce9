The upcoming Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 3, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> 3 will have an updated S11 system in package (SiP), but it may not bring much in the way of processor performance improvements.<br/>

Apple accidentally leaked some internal information about the upcoming chip, and it turns out it will have the same T8310 architecture as the S9 and S10 chips in the Series 9 and Series 10 Apple Watch models. <br/>
<br/>
It's not unusual for Apple to use the same architecture across multiple versions of the S-series chips for the Apple Watch. The S6, S7, and S8 chips all had the same core technology. <br/>
<br/>
The S9 and S10 chips use two "Sawtooth" performance cores like the A16 Bionic chip, so while it is older technology, it's still a lot of power for a wrist-worn device. It's a 64-bit dual-core processor with a 4-core Neural Engine, second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) support, and 64GB storage space. <br/>
<br/>
Though the underlying technology is the same, Apple could make other tweaks. With the S10, for example, Apple redesigned the chip with a thinner profile so it would take up less space inside the watch. <br/>
<br/>
With the S11 chip set to stay largely the same in the 2025 Apple Watch models, it's likely Apple's upcoming S12 chip for 2026 will use a new microarchitecture with performance improvements. <br/>
<br/>
Though Apple's code only gave us insight into the Ultra 3 and Series 11, there were codenames for future devices as well:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>N227: Apple Watch Series 11</li><br/>
<li>N228: Apple Watch Series 11 (Cellular)</li><br/>
<li>N230: Apple Watch Ultra 3</li><br/>
<li>N237: Apple Watch Series 12</li><br/>
<li>N238: Apple Watch Series 12 (Cellular)</li><br/>
<li>N240: Apple Watch Ultra 4</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

The Apple Watch Ultra 3, Apple Watch Series 11, and &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; 3 are expected to debut at Apple's upcoming September event. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-watch-s11-chip-info/">Leaked S11 Chip Details Reveal No Major Performance Upgrades for 2025 Apple Watches</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaked-s11-chip-details-reveal-no-major-performance-upgrades-for-2025-apple-watches.2463338/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
