WhatsApp this week <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/encrypting-your-whatsapp-chat-backup-just-got-easier">announced</a> that it is adding passkey-encrypted chat backups, allowing users to protect their stored messages using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> instead of a 64-digit key.<br/>

The feature extends the app's 2021 end-to-end encrypted backup system, which previously required users to create and save a lengthy key to restore chats. With passkeys, authentication uses each device's built-in authentication hardware like &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, meaning the private cryptographic key never leaves the phone. This makes backups both more secure and much easier to restore.<br/>
<br/>
The rollout is set to be global and gradual over the coming weeks. Users can enable it via <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Chats</strong> → <strong>Chat backup</strong> → <strong>End-to-end encrypted backup</strong> once available. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> and Google Drive remain the storage destinations for iOS and Android, respectively. The move continues Meta's broader adoption of passkeys, which WhatsApp first supported for account logins in 2023.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/02/whatsapp-to-add-passkey-encrypted-backups/">WhatsApp to Add Support for Passkey-Encrypted Backups</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-to-add-support-for-passkey-encrypted-backups.2470294/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
