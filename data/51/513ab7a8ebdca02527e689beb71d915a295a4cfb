<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in New Delhi for a two‑day state visit, his first trip to India since Russia’s full‑scale invasion of Ukraine and the revival of the annual India‑Russia summit after a four‑year pause. The talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi will focus on reshaping defence, energy and trade ties at a time when President Trump’s sanctions and steep US tariffs have sharply reduced Russian oil sales to India and raised the cost of Indian exports to the US. New Delhi aims to preserve its long‑standing strategic partnership with Moscow, including major arms cooperation, while also reassuring Washington that it is not undermining Western pressure on Russia over the war in Ukraine. The visit is also expected to produce agreements on labour mobility, civil nuclear cooperation and new avenues for Indian exports, signalling both countries’ desire to broaden their relationship beyond discounted oil.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/aVs_PAAiyhldLoITPwiYkW_hHq1xwYQ1oyX-PT1hfLIvqug_Mw_pY-vSCTBMYpbodCrv1etzb4NHvhlZkGgJELsbqhr5wYnPfziRhgK9OKi9RiwRwio9hiuWipRt1Fqr2B8Iolro3ZqPg7pDH5jQ927sEcY3mZY3yIKcm3W9gxHPS23pZcajjTwrEyPv32dmYR7t3A' alt='President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India greet each other before a meeting in New Delhi in 2021, ahead of Putin&#x27;s new state visit.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Submarine agreement: India has agreed to lease a nuclear‑powered attack submarine from Russia for around $2 billion, with the vessel to be based in India for roughly a decade, extending a pattern of Soviet‑ and Russian‑supplied undersea platforms to the Indian Navy.</li><li>High‑end weapons: Officials and analysts say discussions include possible joint production or purchase of advanced systems such as Sukhoi Su‑57 fighter jets and the S‑500 air‑defence system, alongside a newly ratified bilateral military cooperation treaty that formalizes joint exercises and logistics support.</li><li>Beyond energy: India and Russia are using the summit to push cooperation in pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, tourism, industrial partnerships and information technology to reduce the current heavy tilt of trade toward Russian energy exports and Indian imports.</li><li>Labour mobility: A proposed labour mobility pact could open pathways for thousands of skilled Indian professionals to work in Russia in sectors such as construction, healthcare and information technology, helping Moscow address workforce gaps while creating new remittance flows for India.</li><li>Ukraine peace diplomacy: Putin’s trip comes as various international actors press Russia to move toward a settlement in Ukraine, and Indian officials are expected to reiterate their calls for dialogue and respect for the UN Charter while avoiding public criticism of Moscow’s military actions.</li></ul><blockquote>It may look like business as usual when Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi meet in Delhi this week, but the Russian and Indian leaders are under pressure to show they won’t be swayed by Donald Trump. - Christian Science Monitor analysis</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of India: Indian officials frame the visit as part of a broader multi‑alignment strategy that keeps traditional defence and energy ties with Moscow while simultaneously deepening economic and security cooperation with the United States and other Western partners.
