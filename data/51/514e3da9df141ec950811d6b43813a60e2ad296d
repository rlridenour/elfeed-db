<blockquote>
  <p>Not that long ago, believe it or not, Donald Trump ran for
president as the candidate who would defend the First Amendment.</p>

<p>He <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/president-donald-j-trump-free-speech-policy-initiative">warned</a> that a “sinister group of Deep State
bureaucrats, Silicon Valley tyrants, left-wing activists, and
depraved corporate news media” was “conspiring to manipulate and
silence the American people,” and promised that “by restoring free
speech, we will begin to reclaim our democracy, and save our
nation.” On his first day back in office, Trump signed an
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/">executive order</a> affirming the “right of the American
people to engage in constitutionally protected speech.”</p>

<p>If anyone believed him at the time, they should be disabused by
now. One of his most brazen attacks on freedom of speech thus far
came this past weekend, when the president said that he was
thinking about stripping a comedian of her citizenship — for no
apparent reason other than that she regularly criticizes him.</p>

<p>“Because of the fact that Rosie O’Donnell is not in the best
interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration
to taking away her Citizenship. She is a Threat to Humanity, and
should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want
her,” he posted on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114840552173805537">Truth Social</a>.</p>

<p>The people who griped that the Biden Administration was anti-free-speech because they ... <em>checks notes</em> ... applied soft pressure on companies like Meta to clamp down on algorithmically promoting disinformation are pretty quiet these days.</p>
