<p>A landslide triggered by heavy rains collapsed several mines at the Rubaya coltan mining site in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday, with rebel authorities reporting more than 200 deaths. The site is in North Kivu province and has been under the control of the AFC/M23 rebel group since 2024, according to reporting that cites a spokesperson for the rebel-appointed provincial governor. The exact toll remains unclear, but one adviser to the governor cited at least 227 confirmed deaths, while the spokesperson said some people were rescued and others suffered serious injuries, with around 20 injured receiving treatment in health facilities. The incident underscores the dangers faced by people who work and trade around manually dug mine shafts in the region’s rainy season.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/dW0q8A8JdJdGn5h8hxXgqJAYCpy3yQeuS38b2MC5JdZ6hUmqyWZo2jW399kBoHKV5TPon-K2f_ByAtN-7TfqZdtI2O55ss7D7ZN_UrOmx0wI6t_uz33LYWQvRPLFd-aYEOPEK9DZ6Rc2bP8W-7KB4bx2P6jh0QvTtWagfOJH5A' alt='Emergency responders and residents gather after a deadly landslide at the Rubaya coltan mines in eastern DR Congo.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Victims included: Local officials said those killed included miners, children and market women, reflecting how mining sites also function as community marketplaces.</li><li>Medical response: About 20 injured people were being treated at health facilities, the rebel-appointed governor’s spokesperson said.</li><li>Global supply: Rubaya produces around 15% of the world’s coltan, a key input for tantalum used in electronics and other high-heat applications.</li><li>Conflict financing: The United Nations has said AFC/M23 has plundered Rubaya’s mineral wealth to help fund its insurgency; Rwanda has been accused of backing the group but denies it.</li><li>Labor conditions: Reporting described locals manually digging at the site for only a few dollars per day, highlighting the precarious economics around artisanal mining.</li></ul><blockquote>We are in the rainy season.
