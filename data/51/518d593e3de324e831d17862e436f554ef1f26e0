<p>Russia has ratified a Reciprocal Exchange of Logistic Support (Relos) agreement with India, paving the way for their militaries to use each other’s bases, airspace and ports for resupply and maintenance just before President Vladimir Putin’s two‑day state visit to New Delhi starting 4 December. The pact will support joint operations, exercises and disaster relief, and is expected to enhance the Indian Navy’s reach in the Arctic while also facilitating Russian naval access in the Indian Ocean region. Putin has framed India and China as Russia’s key economic partners, saying Moscow aims to upgrade cooperation with both to a “new level,” especially in technology, while Russia and India target a sharp rise in bilateral trade by 2030. New Delhi, meanwhile, is using the visit to seek greater access for Indian exporters to the Russian market and to manage its delicate balancing act between closer defence ties with Moscow, expanding partnership with the United States, and Western pressure over Russia’s actions in Ukraine.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/H6qfpn0ITogWX9D8ttkR6u3pXUBBcgVbge_Q3sSUdBXXfGhpcO5S6C3CwU0zHjG_jI6okbyff5p9pvJB-uAjJ21P8r6l_Xzui8Qxo93UD9Y2f5HAkJbAv8fw6YsAV8JzTpS-uQ3Ve51GuVah0Y0aXjo7tNMrWlGEKFMfPjY' alt='Russian and Indian naval personnel stand near a warship as the two countries deepen defence logistics cooperation ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s New Delhi visit.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Defence logistics pact: The Relos agreement enables reciprocal use of airspace and port facilities for Russian and Indian warships and aircraft, simplifying refuelling, repairs and supplies during peacetime missions and humanitarian operations.</li><li>Arctic access boost: Under Relos, India gains improved logistical support for naval deployments and scientific expeditions in Arctic waters, reinforcing both maritime capabilities and polar research ambitions.</li><li>Energy and exports: Russia remains a major energy supplier to India, and Kremlin officials say both sides are working to expand Indian exports to address New Delhi’s concerns over a lopsided trade balance.</li><li>Currency and payments: Russia and China now conduct almost all bilateral trade in rubles and yuan instead of Western currencies, a model Moscow promotes as it seeks deeper technological and economic ties with India as well.</li><li>Summit agenda breadth: Putin’s roughly 30‑hour visit includes talks on defence deals, labour and mobility pacts, trade expansion and regional security, making it one of the most wide‑ranging India–Russia summits in recent years.</li></ul><blockquote>We are aiming at taking cooperation with the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of India to a whole new level, including through enhancing its technological aspect. - Vladimir Putin</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Russian government: Moscow describes India as a long‑standing friend and key trade partner and says the new logistics pact will make military cooperation and joint activities more efficient for both sides.
