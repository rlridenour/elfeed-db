<p>The biggest thing I want to do on my phone, after making calls, sending messages, and taking pictures, is to <strong><em>quickly</em></strong> <strong>write notes that I can <em>reliably</em> refer to on any other device</strong>.</p>
<p>The tools I use to do that are Drafts, Journelly, and Obsidian. In today’s post I’ll tell you why I like each, and compare them all at the end.</p>
<h3 id="entering-quick-notes-with-drafts">Entering quick notes with Drafts</h3>
<p>Yes, Drafts is back in my rotation now that I know how to use it with Obsidian Sync. It’s even back in my iPhone dock!</p>
<p>Drafts was low friction before, and it’s even more so now that my most used actions appear right above the keyboard. I currently have 5 actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-N - for adding notes to my OBTF-successor, the 1-Note-Inbox. It adds the current date, day, and time, adds a blank line, and draws a horizontal rule between entries. Nice and neat.</li>
<li>todo - for adding tasks to my todo.txt document. It adds the current date and gives the task priority <code>(A)</code>, all in correct todo.txt syntax.</li>
<li>French - for adding flashcards as I come across a word or phrase I want to remember</li>
<li>Text - for sending what I’ve written as a text message</li>
<li>Copy - for getting what I’ve written onto the clipboard</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using Drafts with Obsidian Sync on your iPhone, you’ll need to <em>open Obsidian on your phone after completing a Drafts action</em> to let Obsidian Sync know that it’s there. My Drafts-entered iOS notes appear on my Mac less than 2 seconds after opening Obsidian on my phone.</p>
<h3 id="entering-quick-notes-with-journelly">Entering quick notes with Journelly</h3>
<p><a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/05/19/ptpl-157-journelly-is-org-for-those-who-dont-do-org" title="wikilink">In May last year</a> I described Journelly as<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>the first Org-powered app I’ve seen that lays out the welcome mat for people who don’t even know what Org is, never mind how to use it.”</p>
<p>Since then, Journelly has released an update that gives you the option of storing your entries in either an Org (.org) or a Markdown (.md) file. It means that the file Journelly writes to can now be stored inside an Obsidian vault, even if you use Obsidian Sync!</p>
<p>To be clear: <strong>Journelly writes directly to a file that lives in my Obsidian vault</strong>. This is hugely significant! It means I can share web pages to Journelly, write a brief note about why I saved it, and add one of my task metadata (time, category) to any actions I want to take on the information. That metadata ensures I’ll see it during my next review session. <em>All in one step, all without opening Obsidian.</em></p>
<p>With both Drafts and Journelly available on the Share Sheet, it’s interesting to note when I am drawn to one or the other. A few moments ago I chose Journelly over both Raindrop and Drafts when saving an article I’ll want to reference later, to avoid an extra processing step. One motion and it’s in my system.</p>
<p>Journelly suggests and can autocomplete existing tags as I type them. In Drafts I have to remember my tags and be sure to type them the same way each time.</p>
<p>I love being able to see Journelly entries show up in my task query lists, just by using my customised todo.txt syntax. If something I’ve entered or shared into Journelly needs looking at on a specific date, I preface that date with a colon and it shows up in my text-based planner right when it needs to. (Details on this plugin-free plain task text management method will be published some time this year.)</p>
<p>To point Journelly to an Obsidian vault on your iPhone, press the 3 dots at the bottom of the screen and select Storage from the menu. Then select Other, scroll down, and Move Data. From there you need to navigate to On My Phone, find Obsidian, and select your vault.</p>

<p><a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/06/ptpl-176-simple-obsidian-iphone-shortcuts" title="wikilink">Home screen shortcuts</a> have sped up entering notes directly into my Obsidian vault, but it’s not as quick as Journelly or as flexible as Drafts. I’m aware that there are specialised, sophisticated shortcuts available that can do pretty much everything; I haven’t gone down that route because I haven’t felt the need to. If you are interested in learning more about how to get superpowers with Apple Shortcuts + Obsidian, check out <a href="https://actions.work/actions-for-obsidian/" target="_blank">Actions For Obsidian</a>.</p>
<p>I generally only type directly into Obsidian on my phone when working on a project, or adding events to my planner.</p>

<p>There are other plain text ways to enter text quickly on iOS and have it show up on a Mac. Let me know about any workflows you are particularly fond of.</p>
<p>If you end up buying and enjoying Journelly, spread the news! Let’s support an indie app maker who is choosing to stay away from the subscription model. Contact the developer (Xenodium) to request trial access to the beta if you want to check it out first.</p>
