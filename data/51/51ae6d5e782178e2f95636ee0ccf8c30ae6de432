As a practice, I managed to illustrate <strong>Clojure files</strong> using <a href="https://whatacold.io/blog/2021-08-07-illustrate-clojure-snippet/">illustrate.clj</a>, but my original idea was to annotate org-mode files of blogs. It&#39;s not uncommon that a blog post has some code snippets.</p>
<p>
But it missed the feature until last night, as I wasn&#39;t sure how to implement it appropriately before and didn&#39;t have enough time.</p>
<p>
For example, I may have an org-mode like this:</p>
<div class="src src-org">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-org" data-lang="org"><span class="line"><span class="cl">sum of two numbers:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c">#+begin_src </span><span class="cs">clojure</span><span class="c">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c"></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c">#+end_src</span></span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
I want to have a result comment (<code class="verbatim">(;; =&gt; 3)</code>) after each top-level form after using <code class="verbatim">illustrate.clj</code>:
sum of two numbers:</p>
