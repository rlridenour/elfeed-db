<p>Major update to Rogue Amoeba’s essential audio utility for the Mac. I’ve written about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/09/soundsource-5">versions 5</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/04/04/soundsource-4">and 4</a> previously, and everything I wrote then remains true. SoundSource remains the system-wide audio menu item that ought to be built into MacOS, giving you easy, intuitive control over every audio <em>device</em> (input and output), and easy, intuitive control over every <em>app</em> in which you play or record audio. That one seemingly-simple app does both those things is quite the remarkable design achievement. And aside from that usability, SoundSource remains an exemplar of UI design stylistically — distinctive and branded, while looking and feeling in every way like a standard Mac app.</p>

<p>New tentpole features in version 6 include fine-grained AirPlay support (e.g. route output from one app over AirPlay while leaving the rest of your system’s audio output local to your Mac), groups for output devices, and a new “Quick Configs” feature for saving and switching between, well, quick configurations. $49 for a new license, $25 to upgrade from a previous one.</p>
