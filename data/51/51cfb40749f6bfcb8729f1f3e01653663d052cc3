</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A Zen and Indigenous Perspective on Resilience, Shared Purpose, and Leadership in the Timeplace of Collapse
</p>
        <p><time datetime="2025-06-07" title="2025-06-07">Yesterday</time>, after having met, talked, and laughed with friends; after having
planted a few more bushes and tending the garden; after having napped for a bit
of the afternoon; after having kayaked around the lake; and after having played
frisbee in the lake with the dogs; then we set about physical relaxation.</p>
<p>I could’ve joined in watching <cite>Mountainhead</cite>, which Jenny was watching
in the other room; I feel enough of that having moved within the slipstream of
technologists inflating the sense of inevitability and ego-centrism.  Instead I
sat down and read <cite data-id="95cc0be8-ed94-44c5-a193-696c32426e72">When No Thing Works</cite> by Norma Kaelokū Wong.</p>
<p>How might one describe receiving “a Zen and Indigenous Perspective” book?</p>
<p>That <time datetime="2025-06-07" title="2025-06-07">yesterday</time>, I was checking the atmospheric quality, hoping it would be
acceptable enough to spend a bit of extended time outside; knowing that as has
become a disheartening recurrence, summer’s amongst the great lakes are laden
with a heavy dose of Boreal wildfire particulate.</p>
<p>And that laughter and talking amongst friends was also listening and walking
with each other through the sadness of those important to us, those that have
received a bombardment of lies, and metabolized those lies into identity.</p>
<p>And always this rattling in the back of my brain an admonishment issued directly
at me regarding Kierkegaard; not the one in which my college professor said I
had the soul of a philosopher, but instead a voice asserting that I must take a
leap.</p>
<p>Earlier that <time datetime="2025-06-07" title="2025-06-07">yesterday</time> I had shared about <cite data-id="F2868D00-9BDB-4D43-8780-B23D66A94146">Always Coming Home</cite> by Ursula K. Le Guin, a book on my to-read list.  One about an ethnography of a future of the
bay area; one that looks past collapse and to rebirth.  Intertwined with that
was my sitting amongst the warmth of someone sharing the laughter and
hope in having read <cite data-id="4b6ca2f0-8e70-40b4-b18e-fe87b643b3e6">Pranksters vs. Autocrats</cite> by Srdja Popovic and Sophia A. McClennen.</p>
<p>That, and my glancing at a calendar to see that <time datetime="2025-06-14" title="2025-06-14">June 14th</time> is what will be my
beloved, now departed, Corrie’s 13th birthday.  Also, a day for a local pride
festival, my country’s “flag day”, a day of planned protests, as well as the
likely rumbling of tanks.  Yet here I am, in the drive-past-area-of-fly-over
country.</p>
<p>Where the ideal grid layout of roads twist and face reality of the myriad of
lakes that shape and sustain these parts.</p>
<p>Also, having spent a week of work, stumbling through a new programming language,
in which the pattern matching paradigm created a few moments of deep
frustration; my habits of other languages impeding my ability to see the
self-inflicted problems in the moment.</p>
<p>From this work, I felt in a grip of artificial problem solving; not of food nor
shelter nor art as we might name it, but instead at determining the proper maps
to move bits from one shape to another across differing territories.</p>
<p>That is the soil in which I received and planted <cite data-id="95cc0be8-ed94-44c5-a193-696c32426e72">When No Thing Works</cite>.  While
reading, I underscored several passages.  I notably stumbled on one, as one must
do with good Zen meditations.  The tripwire, an adverb; a kind of thing that
this <time datetime="2025-06-05" title="2025-06-05">past Thursday</time> a friend and I shared with another friend the general writing
advice: avoid and remove adverbs.</p>
<p>How I read the passage:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

Processing is an acceptable, cautious way to be productive.  (Ouch.)  Sometimes,
the best we are able to do is to simply process.

</blockquote>

<p>What was written:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

Processing is an acceptable, cautious way to be productive.  (Ouch.)  Sometimes,
the best we are able to do is to simplify process.

</blockquote>

<p>To simplify in coding, I remove <code>if</code> statements; but in this mental removal of <code>if</code>
I transformed the adverb from one of action to one of abdication.  I only caught
this reduction as I was transcribing quotes for <a href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/epigraphs/">my Epigraphs page</a>.</p>
<p>I had read “processing” as the act of thinking through the inputs; and the
simply had hit as “just let those inputs flow through.”  Changing “simply” to
“simplify” mysteriously shifted the relationship between “processing” and
“process.”</p>
<p>And I need to pick at that mystery.</p>
<p>There is the “productive.  (Ouch.)” in which I chuckle; recognizing my
indoctrination into the cult of the Protestant work ethic, (e.g., productivity
gospel).  Now, with processing as acceptable, to simplify processing is to
remove aspects; be it the inputs or the rituals in which we chew and digest
those inputs.  Any health nut will tell you processed food is antithetical to
good health.</p>
<p>And what of the outputs?  Productivity demands never decreasing outputs; are we
to simplify the process yet still produce the same or more?  Yes.  But for whom
are we producing?  Why for us, the humans, both myself and you and them.  All of
us.</p>
<p>Later, chapters speak to reduction for capacity, and that compared to a
scattershot approach (or doing all the things) a sustained narrow focus will
accomplish far more with less effort.  And leave capacity for adaption.</p>
<p>And then I smile and chuckle at the solid advice of eliminating adverbs, because
had the author avoided adverbs; I would not have stumbled, and the sentence
would have been much as I had first read it.  Instead the adverb, which I
assumed, but found absent become the crucial detail.  Then again knowing a best
practice, and when to ignore it, are marks of wisdom.</p>
