<p><a href="https://github.com/mikker/LeaderKey.app?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">LeaderKey.app</a> is a good application. I loved trying it out.</p>
<p>I was wondering whether I could replicate its functionality with the tools I have already available on my machine. The obvious candidate was <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/" target="_blank">Keyboard Maestro</a>. I found inspiration from <a href="https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/leader-launcher/39589" target="_blank">Leader Launcher - Macro Library - Keyboard Maestro Discourse</a>.</p>
<p>This was the result of the exercise.</p>
<h2 id="making-a-launcher-group">Making a Launcher Group</h2>
<p>I made a macro group, called Launcher. Assigned it a keyboard command of <strong>Hyper-O</strong>. The Hyper key is all of the modifier keys held together (⌃⇧⌥⌘). Difficult to do on a normal keyboard but my <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander" target="_blank">Moonlander</a> has a custom key assigned to Hyper key.</p>

<h2 id="making-individual-launchers">Making Individual Launchers</h2>
<p>I made a whole series of macros designed to launch particular programs. This is the one for Acorn.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_c4a729f3205a44e5a9669523ddfb8b2e/_image_cache/87ba074a-d909-42a9-abe1-cc814f787d94.png" alt="Acorn Launch" width="1032" height="900" data-action="zoom"><span class="caption">Acorn Launch</span></p>
<p>I put the letter that was going to invoke the macro from the palette in front of the name. So this one was called <em>a Acorn</em>. Followed that with a whole slew of application launchers.</p>
<h2 id="problem-with-multiple-applications-with-the-same-starting-letter">Problem With Multiple Applications With the Same Starting Letter</h2>
<p>Very soon I ran into the need to have launchers for Emacs and EagleFiler. They share a common first letter. I solved this problem by assigning them both the same letter but naming them differently. So it was <strong>e1 Emacs</strong> and <strong>e2 EagleFiler</strong></p>
<p>For Emacs:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_c4a729f3205a44e5a9669523ddfb8b2e/_image_cache/2ec6a1e0-19b8-48b6-b4e4-439c5d62c76f.png" alt="Emacs" width="978" height="912" data-action="zoom"><span class="caption">Emacs</span></p>
<p>For EagleFiler:</p>

<p>Now when I press ‘e’ I get the following palette:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_c4a729f3205a44e5a9669523ddfb8b2e/_image_cache/07acb7ca-18e2-4136-ad76-5f912913ad93.png" alt="Dupes" width="324" height="240" data-action="zoom"><span class="caption">Dupes</span></p>
<p>I can just press the relevant number and it launches the application assigned to that number.</p>
<h2 id="work-spaces">Work Spaces</h2>
<p>While working I notice that I have groups of applications open for particular tasks. For instance, first thing in the morning I have to open Mail and Chrome. Catch up on email and catch up on news. So I made a launcher which launched both of these.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_c4a729f3205a44e5a9669523ddfb8b2e/_image_cache/a3b27392-c393-4103-8738-69680f8f6977.png" alt="Workspace" width="1008" height="970" data-action="zoom"><span class="caption">Workspace</span></p>
<p>I have a similar one for when I am writing. Emacs, Dictionary and Chrome. That is assigned to a different Workspace.</p>
<p>This is how the Keyboard Maestro pallette looks when invoked with <strong>Hyper+O</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was an interesting exercise, replicating most of the features of an application in Keyboard Maestro. I am amazed by what this little macro program is capable of. I have barely scratched the surface of its abilities. It makes my experience in macOS better.</p>
