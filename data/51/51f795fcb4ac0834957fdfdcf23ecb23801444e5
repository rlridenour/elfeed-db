<p>Blockbuster sports streaming news from Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple and Formula 1 today announced a five-year partnership that
will bring all F1 races exclusively to Apple TV in the United
States beginning next year. [...]</p>

<p>Apple TV will deliver comprehensive coverage of Formula 1, with
all practice, qualifying, Sprint sessions, and Grands Prix
available to Apple TV subscribers. Select races and all practice
sessions will also be available for free in the Apple TV app
throughout the course of the season. In addition to broadcasting
Formula 1 on Apple TV, Apple will amplify the sport across Apple
News, Apple Maps, Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+. Apple Sports — the free app for iPhone — will feature live updates for every
qualifying, Sprint, and race for each Grand Prix across the
season, with real-time leaderboards, season driver and constructor
standings, Live Activities to follow on the Lock Screen, and a
designated widget for the iPhone Home Screen.</p>

<p>F1 TV Premium, F1’s own premier content offering, will continue to
be available in the U.S. via an Apple TV subscription only and
will be free for those who subscribe.</p>

<p>If I’m reading this right, all you need to get access to <em>everything</em> F1-related is an Apple TV subscription (the service <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/13/apple-tv-minus">formerly known as TV+</a>) and to be in the US. This even includes <a href="https://f1tv.formula1.com/">F1 TV Premium</a> — normally $130/year — which <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/looking-for-the-red-flags-in-apples-formula-1-tv-deal/">Jason Snell wrote about</a> in a piece <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/14/snell-f1-apple">I linked to</a> earlier this week.</p>

<p>Basically, this sounds like the sort of sports broadcasting deal that Eddy Cue has been talking about as Apple’s goal for years — the rights to the entire sport, free of charge if you’re an Apple TV subscriber.</p>
