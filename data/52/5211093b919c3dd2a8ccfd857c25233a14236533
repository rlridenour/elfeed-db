<p>Mike Isaac, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eight years ago, SerpApi, a start-up in Austin, Texas, dived
headlong into the byzantine world of using robots to “scrape”
Google’s search algorithms, so it could collect information to
help customers appear higher in search results.</p>

<p>Then OpenAI’s ChatGPT came along, kicking off an artificial
intelligence revolution. As more tech companies began building
A.I. chatbots to keep up, they needed large amounts of data to
train their A.I. models — data that SerpApi had already gathered.</p>

<p>Practically overnight, a class of companies like SerpApi — known
as “data scrapers” — found a new business selling data scraped
from Google to companies looking to train their A.I. chatbots.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the internet message board Reddit decided to fight
the data scrapers. It filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York claiming that four companies
had illegally stolen its data by scraping Google search results in
which Reddit content appeared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d never heard of — or at least never noticed — SerpApi until a few weeks ago, when a good friend asked me if I’d ever looked into them. The entire premise of their business is crazy. SerpApi prints the crime right on the tin, describing their service as a “Google Search API” and “Scrape Google and other search engines from our fast, easy, and complete API.” What makes this so crazy is that <em>Google doesn’t offer a search API.</em> SerpApi is offering the Google search API that Google itself doesn’t offer, and charging companies money for it. Everyone, upon hearing the premise and nature of SerpApi, asks the same question: <em>How is this legal?</em> The answer is, it probably isn’t. But <a href="https://serpapi.com/">right on SerpApi’s home page</a> they claim to offer customers a “U.S. Legal Shield”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The crawling and parsing of public data is protected by the First
Amendment of the United States Constitution. We value freedom of
speech tremendously. We assume scraping and parsing liabilities
for both domestic and foreign companies unless your usage is
otherwise illegal. (Including but are not limited to: acts of
cyber criminality, terrorism, pedopornography, denial of service
attacks, and war crimes.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My only surprise here is that it’s Reddit taking SerpApi (along with two similar companies, one from Lithuania and the other from Russia — the former Soviet states respect intellectual property about as much as China does) to court, not Google. Why Google hasn’t sued them yet, I don’t understand. Anyway, back to Isaac’s report for the Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perplexity was one of those buyers, according to Reddit’s lawsuit.
Perplexity had scraped Reddit data in the past without payment but
agreed to stop after Reddit sent it a cease-and-desist order. Even
so, citations to Reddit data in Perplexity search results jumped
“fortyfold,” the lawsuit said. Reddit has spent tens of millions
of dollars on anti-scraping systems over several years.</p>

<p>“Perplexity’s business model is effectively to take Reddit’s
content from Google search results,” then feed it into an A.I.
model and “call it a new product,” the lawsuit said.</p>

<p>Reddit said it had set a trap for Perplexity by creating a “test
post” on its site that could “only be crawled by Google’s search
engine and was not otherwise accessible anywhere on the internet.”
Within hours, Perplexity search results had surfaced the content
of that test post, the lawsuit said.</p>

<p>Google, which is not a plaintiff in Reddit’s lawsuit, has tried
and failed to stop SerpApi and other data scrapers, according to
the lawsuit and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-challenging-google-using-search-data?rc=fiplau">previous reporting from The Information</a>.</p>

<p>The people leading Perplexity aren’t just shifty — they’re stupid. That whole company <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/19/perplexity-bullshit-machine">just</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/12/perplexity-jumps-shark-stunt-offer-to-buy-chrome">reeks</a> of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/05/regarding-those-rumors-of-apple-pursuing-an-acquisition-of-perplexity">being a scam</a>.</p>
