With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, video editors can use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> to create stylized images, and Magnetic Mask workflows have been streamlined with a new keyboard shortcut to show or hide the Magnetic Mask Organizer. There are also new features for moving markets and naming audio effects, with Apple's release notes listed below.<br/>
<blockquote>- Add color corrections and effects to an adjustment clip above the timeline to apply them to a range of clips at once.<br/>
- Get inspired with Image Playground and use Apple Intelligence to quickly create stylized images based on a description, suggested concepts, or people from your Photos library. (Requires macOS 15.2 or later on Mac models with M1 or later.)<br/>
- Speed up your Magnetic Mask workflows with important bug fixes, performance improvements, and a new keyboard shortcut to show or hide the Magnetic Mask Editor.<br/>
- Use the Quantec QRS (Quantec Room Simulator) effect to create natural and transparent audio reverbs that simulate real acoustic spaces.<br/>
- Stay organized by renaming audio effects in the inspector.<br/>
- Reveal the source of a multicam angle or synced clip in the browser.<br/>
- Move markers in the timeline by dragging them in a clip, or remove markers by dragging them out of a clip.</blockquote><br/>
Apple has also updated its Motion and Compressor software that accompanies Final Cut Pro. Motion has &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; integration, and Compressor offers machine learning-powered frame rate retiming.<br/>
