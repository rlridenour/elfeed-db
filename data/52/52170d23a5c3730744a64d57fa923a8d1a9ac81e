<p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe traveled to Caracas for a high-profile meeting with Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, marking the most senior US visit since a US raid captured President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month. US officials said Ratcliffe delivered a message that Washington wants an improved working relationship and discussed security priorities, including preventing Venezuela from becoming a foothold for “America’s adversaries”. The trip also sparked debate about US intentions and Venezuela’s political direction, as some observers framed it as recognition of the interim government while opposition figures signaled they still intend to pursue the presidency.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/tITbNAvcpQ1Umk9nkXZC_jXyhSKDL75J6mUSMd1Tm19E4YdRASuyjkU9kS3l01g4C6AIJL0PjmIwIo6CKvWf-fOEE6tfbef1LPHP8zh6IvJ9wD0FBZyqCVuqcj9MtOyd_bEfPlDTbnSEX7muIKDk__XOCA4ODoKS3tP67_eKHlsORUI224zQCDM' alt='John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, met with Venezuela’s interim president Delcy Rodríguez and delivered a message of cooperation.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Two-hour talks: US and Venezuelan officials described the Caracas meeting as lasting about two hours, with discussions that included economic opportunities alongside security cooperation.</li><li>Message delivered: A US official told CBS News Ratcliffe conveyed that the United States “looks forward to an improved working relationship” with Venezuela.</li><li>Security emphasis: Mercopress reported the agenda centered on security and cooperation, citing US intelligence sources confirming the talks.</li><li>Opposition push: The Guardian reported opposition leader María Corina Machado vowed she would become Venezuela’s president and said she gave her Nobel peace prize medal to President Trump in recognition of the move against Maduro.</li><li>Competing narratives: RT characterized Maduro’s removal as a “kidnap” and claimed CIA agents helped oust him, underscoring sharply different interpretations of the US action.</li></ul><blockquote>Looks forward to an improved working relationship - A U.S. official</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US officials (briefed to media): They presented the visit as outreach focused on security and a potential reset, including keeping Venezuela from becoming a hub for “America’s adversaries,” while also discussing economic opportunities.
