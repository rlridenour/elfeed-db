Apple today seeded release candidate versions of upcoming iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 updates to developers and public beta testers for testing purposes, with the updates coming a week after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/14/apple-seeds-ios-18-6-beta-3/">seeded the third betas</a>. The release candidates mark the final version of the software that will be provided to the public provided no additional bugs are found.<br/>

iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 can be downloaded from the Settings app on a compatible device by going to General > Software Update.<br/>

No notable new features have been found in the iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 betas, so it's not clear what might be added in the update, though there are some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/26/app-store-eu-rule-change-dma/">changes to the App Store</a> in the EU due to the DMA. Rumors suggest that Apple wanted to expand <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> to China with iOS 18.6, but regulatory hurdles have delayed the launch.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 likely focus on smaller changes and bug fixes, and we'll update this article should anything new be found in the fourth beta.<br/>
