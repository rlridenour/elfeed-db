<p>President Trump held a campaign-style rally at a casino in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, presenting an upbeat view of the US economy while many Americans report struggling with higher living costs. He argued that his policies, including tariffs on imports, are creating jobs, lifting the stock market and drawing more investment into the United States, and said consumer prices were now falling sharply. In his remarks, the President described talk of an &quot;affordability crisis&quot; as a hoax and urged voters to trust his economic stewardship as Republicans prepare for a difficult midterm election fight next year. Opposition politicians, independent fact-checkers and some media outlets challenged several of his claims, noting that many households still feel a significant financial squeeze despite strong headline economic indicators.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Yt9vXeXjOGpV4q7bXk9RTq4CBvcQ7g1bAat7GbCPB2TsTL-uNBhs2gD_O9c_g9F9yPEWhKbRabP02SyJNu3zWb9V5giSIcs3BZJO7al3uWyWtJXOIH4FltLH4cNx99qxFbCWofkR2TobnLRD_ZRd2STc51-LUiMlY8rE0S_h2Fngeld4mhZ8pS7l4T2CWNjJ29c5l887Gmq_6GeSrL4PR1RRu3VIfZtZ1bn2XIE' alt='President Trump delivers an economic speech to supporters at a Pennsylvania rally focused on affordability.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>New campaign slogan: Trump framed his economic message around a pledge to &quot;make America affordable again,&quot; signaling that household costs will be central to Republicans’ midterm pitch next year.</li><li>Tariffs as centerpiece: He highlighted his administration’s broad tariffs on imported goods as a key tool he says is encouraging companies to expand production and jobs inside the United States rather than overseas.</li><li>Immigration rhetoric: During the speech, Trump coupled his economic message with harsh language about immigrants and certain foreign countries, drawing criticism from opponents who said this undercut his attempt to reconnect with worried voters.</li><li>Attempted reset: The event was widely viewed as an effort to reset the White House’s political fortunes after recent Republican electoral setbacks and accusations that Trump has been distant from everyday affordability concerns.</li><li>First rally in months: The Pennsylvania appearance marked Trump’s first large rally with voters outside Washington in several months, part of a renewed push to engage directly with audiences in key battleground states.</li></ul><blockquote>We are making America affordable again - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Trump insisted that his policies are producing strong job creation, stock market gains and rising investment, and maintained that stories about a severe affordability crisis are misleading or exaggerated.
