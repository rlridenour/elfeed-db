<p>I&#8217;ve updated the <a href="https://dailynous.com/comments-policy/">Comments Policy</a> at Daily Nous with a passage about using AI to write comments here.<span id="more-56373"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_44775" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-44775" class=" wp-image-44775" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/escher-drawing-hands-llm-ai-version.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="585" srcset="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/escher-drawing-hands-llm-ai-version.jpg 1000w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/escher-drawing-hands-llm-ai-version-300x251.jpg 300w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/escher-drawing-hands-llm-ai-version-768x642.jpg 768w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/escher-drawing-hands-llm-ai-version-400x334.jpg 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-44775" class="wp-caption-text">[Manipulation of M.C. Escher&#8217;s &#8220;Drawing Hands&#8221;]</p></div>The update was occasioned by a recent discussion in which a few accusations were tossed around that commenters were submitting AI-written comments.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I added:</p>
<ul class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image">
<li class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image">Regarding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) / large language model (LLM) tools</strong> like ChatGPT, Claude, and the like: Generally, please do not submit comments written in whole or in part by these tools.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="color: #008000;">That said,</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><em class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image">quoting </em>the writing of these tools in order to discuss their outputs or capabilities, if relevant to the topic of the post, may be acceptable. If you do this, you should clearly identify the text as AI-generated and identify which tool(s) you used.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #008000;"><em class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image">translation or minor editing </em>of comments using AI tools or apps/software that makes use of AI may be acceptable, provided that you clearly identify the text that was translated or edited by an AI tool and identify which tool(s)/software you used.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="color: #008000;">As I say [earlier in the comments policy], Daily Nous is a space for philosophers, academics, students, and other interested parties to discuss news and issues related to philosophy and the philosophy profession. <strong class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image">Discussion here is a social enterprise entered into on the expectation that our interlocutors are other persons interested in conversing about the topic under consideration, and that the words they are using are their own. </strong>I think that’s a reasonable and valuable expectation that helps contribute to the quality of the discussions here, and I want to protect it against behavior that would undermine it.</span></p>
<p class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" style="padding-left: 80px;"><span style="color: #008000;">If you suspect a comment is AI-authored, please let me know about it by emailing me here, and I will take a look and, if I think you’re right, remove it. <strong>Please do not make such accusations in the comments thread</strong>, as doing so is not conducive to a good discussion atmosphere. Thank you.</span></p>
