<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has formally asked President Isaac Herzog to pardon him from ongoing corruption charges, submitting a letter and a detailed 111‑page legal brief arguing that the trial is damaging Israel and preventing him from fully focusing on governing during a period of security and political strain. Netanyahu, who has been on trial since 2020 in three cases involving allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, continues to deny wrongdoing and portrays the proceedings as divisive for the country. The president’s office called the request “extraordinary” and said it will obtain opinions from the Justice Ministry’s pardons department and other legal authorities before Herzog makes a decision, a process that could take time and has no fixed deadline. The move has sparked a debate among Israeli legal experts and democracy advocacy groups, some of whom warn that granting a pardon before any conviction could weaken public trust in the rule of law, while supporters argue it could help calm political tensions and allow the government to concentrate on national challenges.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/obwc_dx3ofDhv1SBlfWltr15zMhQy5XafDixnRiT3XSG9ltk0S5SRGX0C1M1UMpaIs_iOnh26EPWqv8BdVIsJtMDKP6oReOAwELVXWZrNR3RXXbd3oteEH4d9xFb170X44Ik4RPwbIFpvjy5sZUM6ApQLjAA360sHgD3zbKuUsGV-yKA_ObOOHGJJV1m_MM2cszt1rZJfS9MrmmIz8lExRqukQ6_vWHn9Xvwv6Q2mOcjiUKVovhOA52Cc_jSja9ceK8xWiEqAZBvirK4tEaImTv1wjCPaeW6WRXqG6UWtStZosfIEUFIuNDtMTMNYL7Rk-w9UVdDotr-XMFt1m1k4_XQ4HN7nHLXNsM4xRq4KbJ4-UZAOFuTqOd3wvXskKxBVU9eQYqz6Ru85e8I4A' alt='Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a government event as legal debates swirl around his request for a presidential pardon.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Presidential powers: Although Israel’s presidency is largely ceremonial, the office holds constitutional authority to grant pardons, including in rare situations before a trial ends when deemed in the public interest.</li><li>Legal debate: A former Netanyahu defense lawyer and other legal experts note that past pardon arrangements for public officials have typically required an admission of guilt and resignation from office, conditions that appear at odds with Netanyahu’s insistence on his innocence and his continued role as prime minister.</li><li>Public protests: Hundreds of demonstrators rallied in Tel Aviv near President Herzog’s residence, urging him to reject any pardon and carrying signs that framed the request as an attempt to place leaders above the law.</li><li>Election context: French reporting notes that a successful pardon would remove the legal cloud over Netanyahu as he prepares for an upcoming re‑election campaign, potentially strengthening his political standing if voters view the issue as resolved.</li><li>US involvement: President Trump sent a letter to Israeli authorities urging a pardon for Netanyahu, and his public support has been cited by some commentators as adding international and political pressure around what is formally a domestic legal decision.</li></ul><blockquote>Granting this request will allow the prime minister to devote all of his time, abilities, and energy to advancing Israel in these critical times and to dealing with the challenges and opportunities that lie before it. - Amit Hadad, Netanyahu’s lawyer</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Benjamin Netanyahu and his legal team: Netanyahu’s lawyer argues that ending the trial through a pardon would let the prime minister fully focus on steering Israel through “critical times” and would help mend internal rifts and strengthen national resilience, while Netanyahu maintains he is innocent of all charges.
