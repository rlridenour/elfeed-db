<p>In the latest development, Afghan and Pakistani delegations are heading to Doha for crisis talks after fresh cross-border violence reset tensions at the frontier [abcnews.go.com#1][ndtv.com#1][dw.com#1]. Afghan authorities accuse Pakistan of breaking a 48-hour truce with air attacks that hit Paktika province and nearby areas, killing at least 10 civilians, as both sides prepared to meet [aljazeera.com#1][france24.com#1][lemonde.fr#1]. Pakistan, meanwhile, said its forces carried out precision strikes targeting the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), citing a recent suicide bombing and gun attack in North Waziristan that killed seven paramilitary troops [newarab.com#1]. The clashes over the past week have already left dozens dead and hundreds injured on both sides, underscoring the stakes of the Doha talks [ndtv.com#1]. Reports differ on the truce’s status: some say it expired hours before the meeting while others say it had been extended until talks concluded [france24.com#1][dw.com#1][firstpost.com#2].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/m0KGhEXG_IA259JXvtuA98SZIA7jLzVUfHWevkmGGjg_o5JbbkZ7Q8incDCZl2bUtCxfX4HOjjWx98wxCuv40IVcPoESscrI2Ph6Tc-wT4jiXAzJ-yYW2tXAOKah8Fri879mHPFJoE6iKeUbzR_t6buikbxw91BYv4WtStWhGND0fqQJt0QV4laKHhYmlX6cuPIB' alt='An Afghan man surveys damage in Kabul after cross-border clashes between Afghanistan and Pakistan.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Talks announced: Pakistan state television announced the Qatar talks as delegations prepared to travel for crisis discussions [thehindu.com#1].</li><li>Strike sites: Afghan police reported hits in Paktika’s Khanadar village and two other border areas, including a civilian house [france24.com#1].</li><li>Casualties detail: Provincial officials said children were among the victims and at least 12 people were wounded in the latest strikes [newarab.com#1].</li><li>Truce extension: Firstpost reported both sides had agreed to extend the 48-hour pause until talks concluded before fresh attacks were reported [firstpost.com#2].</li><li>District reports: Local outlet KabulNow listed Barmal and Urgun among districts struck during the overnight raids [kabulnow.com#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Taliban authorities (Afghanistan): Officials accused Pakistan of breaking the ceasefire by bombing three locations in Paktika and warned that Afghanistan would retaliate.
