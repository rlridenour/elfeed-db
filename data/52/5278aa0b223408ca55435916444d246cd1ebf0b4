<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney arrived in Beijing on Wednesday to try to stabilize and expand Canada’s relationship with China, with trade a central focus after several years of strained ties. The trip comes as Ottawa looks to diversify markets for Canadian exports while managing longstanding Canadian concerns about national security and political interference. Chinese officials, meanwhile, are urging Canada to reduce U.S. influence over its foreign policy—framing President Trump’s recent actions as an opening to loosen the U.S.-Canada alignment.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ylDaEiQYu9T066KGB1uJUdpfZggel48e75tV2ttOx9RuwMCuuisIxwUqacJ-De2PumhvJwuxOHOKmPEuOXEvXJ5o6_UxuH13vZFyRMLuJBRb5sZHtjmYGB8Rq6DBnLVCLUte7IrCvhGHoMJoHvlBlEoAa6IEZyfIv-_Pd9m_KGYZj4Ttw_WTpbh9ZCxnxDIQIs3yoIwP' alt='Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada and his advisers have said that he is seeking a pragmatic thawing of Canada’s relationship with China.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tariff friction: The reset effort is complicated by active trade disputes, including Canada’s steep levies on Chinese electric vehicles and China’s retaliatory tariffs on some Canadian agricultural products.</li><li>Pragmatic approach: Carney and his advisers have described the goal as a “pragmatic thawing” rather than a wholesale realignment, reflecting an attempt to find workable cooperation while keeping risk controls in place.</li><li>Beijing’s pitch: Chinese messaging around the visit has emphasized that Canada should “break from” U.S. influence, portraying closer China ties as a strategic alternative for Ottawa.</li><li>Washington factor: Multiple accounts describe the U.S. relationship as a key constraint on Canada’s outreach, with Carney seeking improved China commerce without provoking the United States amid President Trump’s more confrontational posture toward other countries.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Canada (Prime Minister Mark Carney): Carney is trying to deepen trade and repair ties with China while avoiding compromises on national security and limiting fallout with the United States.
