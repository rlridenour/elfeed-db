<p>The #1 thing I miss from Linux while using a Mac is strace. Recently I found
out about <code>fs_usage</code> that does part of what strace does and I was SO happy.</p>
<p>(I’ve also tried dtruss/dtrace etc and a couple of other things which I have failed to get to work, I&rsquo;m not willing to turn off SIP)</p>
<p>For example here&rsquo;s me looking at what config files <code>fish</code> opens:</p>

<p>(for some reason I can&rsquo;t grep <code>fs_usage</code>&rsquo;s output directly, not sure why)</p>
