Meta today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/new-threads-features-more-personalized-experience-you-control/">announced</a> it is rolling out two new Threads features that will give users more control over the visibility of content on the platform.<br/>

First, new "mentions" and "people you follow" filters in the Activity tab will allow you to fine-tune the replies that are visible in the feed.<br/>
<br/>
Second, a new "review and approve replies" option when drafting a post will allow you to approve replies to your post before they are visible to the public.<br/>

The features will be available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads/id6446901002">Threads app on iPhone</a>, and presumably on other platforms.<br/>
<br/>
Threads is a social media platform that competes with X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky and Mastodon. Meta launched Threads in 2023, less than a year after Elon Musk acquired Twitter, and it works with an Instagram account.<br/>
