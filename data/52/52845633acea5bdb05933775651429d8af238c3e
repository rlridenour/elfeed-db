Apple's large-screened foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> could be delayed due to development issues, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/apple-s-planned-foldable-ipad-with-18-inch-screen-hits-development-snags">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple wanted to launch the device in 2028, but problems with weight and display technology may cause it to be pushed back until 2029.<br/>

Multiple rumors have suggested that Apple is working on a large foldable device, though information has diverged on whether it will be positioned as an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; or a Mac. The product is expected to have an 18-inch display created by Samsung, with Apple focusing on minimizing the display crease.<br/>
<br/>
A large foldable OLED display is expensive, and the foldable device could be up to three times as expensive as the 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. Apple charges &#36;1,299 for the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, so if prices doesn't come down for components over the next few years, the foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; could cost as much as &#36;3,900.<br/>
<br/>
When the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is closed, it looks like a Mac, with an aluminum shell and no exterior display. When open, it is similar in size to the 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, but there is no physical keyboard. Because of the large screen size and the aluminum chassis, prototypes weigh around 3.5 pounds, making it significantly heavier than the current &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, the foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is apparently similar in design to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/huawei-matebook-fold/">the Huawei MateBook Fold</a>, which is an 18-inch foldable tablet priced at &#36;3,400.<br/>
