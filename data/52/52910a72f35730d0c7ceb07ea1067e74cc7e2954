 
          <p>My wife recently bought a device to scratch her creative crafting itch: a <em>button press</em>. At first, I dismissed it as yet another thing requiring space in her increasingly messy atelier. I don&rsquo;t know how we manage to do it but we seem to be experts in gathering things that gather things themselves: dust.</p>
<p>But now that she finally started doing something with it, I was secretly becoming interested in what it could mean for our scrapbook making. The button press in question is a &ldquo;We R Makers Button Press Bundle All-In-One Kit&rdquo; that comes with press, a few add-on peripherals that allow you to modify how it cuts and presses, and of course the buttons themselves.</p>

<p>Since handling the lever requires a bit of pressure to correctly cut and a second time fit the cut circle inside the button, I yelled <em>TSJAKKA</em> every time she would press it, to great joy of our daughter. She now calls it <em>the Tsjakka</em>. &ldquo;Daddy, can we make another little monster with Tjsakka?&rdquo; Because my first instinct after thinking about what kind of buttons I wanted was to print a variant of the <a href="https://www.lisperati.com/logo.html">Alien Lisp Mascot</a>&mdash;a green monster with five eyes.</p>
<p>Fellow nerds reading this might have covered their entire laptop back with cool looking stickers: a Docker container sticker, an IDEA logo one, the GitHub Octocat, and god knows what else you managed to nab from a conference table. While I always found those laptops to be just cute, I never wanted to soil mine with a sticker of some technology stack that I would grow to hate a few years later. Thanks to a random takeover by Microsoft sharks, for instance. *cough* <a href="/post/2022/07/give-up-github/">Give Up Github</a> *cough*.</p>
<p>So why not a programming language mascot? Java&rsquo;s The Duke? No way, I&rsquo;m not that big of a Java fan. The Gopher perhaps? Better, but no. If I was to wear a badge, smack on a sticker somewhere prominent, it would have to be of something that makes me happy. Go is cool but boring. Java brings in a lot of money but smells like enterprise mud. So far, I haven&rsquo;t encountered a single programming language that truly makes me happy. But Lisp is coming very close. The Lisp Alien it is, then:</p>

<p>One of the other two buttons is self-explanatory: the <em>Brain Baking</em> logo. The first one on the upper left is a part of my late father-in-law&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s thesis; an electronic schematic with resistors.</p>
<p>The embossed logo on the button press, below the <em>We R</em> name, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Memory Keepers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is exactly what that button is for. They market it as a way to permanently record precious memories&mdash;and wear them <em>on your sleeve</em>. I think it&rsquo;s brilliant. We don&rsquo;t have an endless supply of metal clips and plastic caps to press that memory in so we have to be mindful: which one&rsquo;s do we really want to create? Sure you can buy more and it&rsquo;s not expensive, but that&rsquo;s not the point. The point is that there won&rsquo;t be a Duke on my bag, but there will be a <em>Brain Baking</em> logo. And, apparently, a <code>MAY CONTAIN TRACES OF LISP</code> warning.</p>
<p>Most folks pin these buttons onto the obvious visible part of their bag. But I don&rsquo;t want to come across as a button lunatic (at least not at first sight). A more convincing argument then: the bag I pinned it on is a simple detachable <a href="https://www.decathlon.be/nl/alle-sporten/fietsen/waterdichte-fietstassen">laptop cycle bag</a>. The exterior gets wet now and then. I highly doubt that the button is water resistant. The third but slightly less convincing argument is that the buttons rattle quite a bit as the needle on the back used to pin it onto something sits quite loose in its metal socket. Perhaps that depends from product type to type.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, our daughter now is dead set on pinning a <em>little monster</em> on her bag she uses carry her lunch go to school.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll first have to ask Tjsakka to get back to work.</p>
