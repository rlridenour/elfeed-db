<p>In the latest push to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio hosted a Ukrainian delegation in Hallandale Beach, Florida, on Sunday for several hours of talks on a draft American peace plan, with both sides calling the discussions productive but incomplete. The Ukrainian team, newly led by national security and defense council secretary Rustem Umerov after the resignation of Andriy Yermak amid a domestic corruption scandal, described the negotiations as difficult yet successful, reflecting the political and military pressure Kyiv faces at home and on the front line. President Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and adviser Jared Kushner joined the Florida meeting and will now carry a revised version of Washington’s roadmap to Moscow, where Witkoff is expected to present it to President Vladimir Putin in talks that Rubio said are necessary because Russia must be “part of the equation” for any deal. Meanwhile, European leaders are launching their own diplomatic efforts, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meeting French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday as EU and NATO officials describe this as a pivotal week for diplomacy and as fighting continues on the ground in Ukraine.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/zcWUnzdD5DJxD0OsAP5qbNzqVLpWP5UvoesqTYp64dvHB_MOY3jyawldiudpAe4B4vSomqpzuMwceiivR-kPB_5lLKZ06NP_z-UmzDWE' alt='US Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets Ukrainian negotiators led by Rustem Umerov in Hallandale Beach, Florida, to discuss a proposed peace plan for Ukraine.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Core issues: US and Ukrainian negotiators in Florida worked through topics such as possible land swaps, security guarantees and a timetable for elections in Ukraine as part of the proposed peace framework, according to a senior US official cited by one outlet.</li><li>Plan evolution: The American blueprint presented in earlier rounds, including talks in Geneva, initially drew criticism in Ukraine and the West for appearing to favor Russian demands, but negotiators say it has since been amended during subsequent meetings, including the latest session in Florida.</li><li>New Ukrainian team: Rustem Umerov’s appointment as Kyiv’s chief negotiator followed the resignation of former head Andriy Yermak on Friday after a corruption scandal, signaling both a change in style at the talks and an attempt by Zelensky’s government to contain domestic fallout.</li><li>US political context: President Trump, who had pledged during his campaign to end the war quickly, has voiced frustration that achieving a settlement has proven harder than he anticipated despite what he describes as a strong relationship with Vladimir Putin, and his team has pressed Kyiv to consider significant concessions including territorial ones.</li><li>European diplomacy: As the US-led track proceeds, Zelensky’s visit to Paris aims to shore up European backing for Ukraine’s negotiating position and military support, with French officials portraying Macron’s meeting as a visible show of solidarity even while Washington engages directly with Moscow.</li></ul><blockquote>There are a lot of moving parts and obviously there&#x27;s another party involved here that will have to be a part of the equation - Marco Rubio</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States government: Marco Rubio said the Florida talks were productive and built on earlier negotiations in Geneva, but stressed that the process is delicate, complicated and will require further work, including direct engagement with Russia later in the week.
