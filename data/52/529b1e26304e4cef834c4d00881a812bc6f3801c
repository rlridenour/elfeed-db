</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
In which I pluck five random quotes from my collection, then interpret them as a story in which I then tell as a poem.
</p>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve been gathering quotes from books, most of which I make
available on <a href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/epigraphs/">my Epigraphs page</a>.  I’ve also been reading a lot more and wrote the
following in my journal:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

These past seven days I’ve read and completed several books.  My brain feels a
bit full.  As though urging me to not read more so that I can metabolize what
I’ve ingested.  But I wonder if there is not a call (of my soul) to use that
energy.  For what?

</blockquote>

<p>Thinking of how I might wrestle with this energy (and thus expend it) I decided
to randomly pluck five quotes from my collection.  I used <a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs/blob/c44afa3951c8dd125937f477838454072300d440/emacs.d/personal.el#L256-L299">my jf/epigraph/random

<h2 id="the-game">The Game</h2>
<p>The game, as envisioned, is to use these quotes in any order to write something.
Below are those randomly selected quotes:</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="the-trial-of-heroes-follows-their-execution">
<p>
The trial of heroes follows their execution.
</p>
<footer>&#8213;Muriel Rukeyser, <cite>The Soul and Body of John Brown</cite></footer></blockquote>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="the-apocalypse-is-always-easier-to-imagine">
<p>
The apocalypse is always easier to imagine than the strange circuitous routes to
what actually comes next.
</p>
<footer>&#8213;Rebecca Solnit, <cite>Hope in the Dark</cite></footer></blockquote>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="20240104T085739">
<p>
These are no wicked faces that you’re allowed to look upon.  They are the faces
of wise women, old as the stones, furrowed with the ruins of the ages, from whom
radiates a deep knowing.  Many of them have gone through the fire, yet their
countenances have not been thereby destroyed, for their knowledge made them
immune to it.
</p>
<footer>&#8213;Gottlob Haag, <cite>Maientanz und Hexentanz</cite></footer></blockquote>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="far-from-being-disturbed-by-the-presence-of">
<p>
Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of
the average community is consoled by the church's silent—and often even
vocal—sanction of things as they are.
</p>
<footer>&#8213;Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., <cite>Letter from a Birmingham Jail</cite></footer></blockquote>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="20221009T120414">
<p>
Nothing is given to people, and the little they can conquer is paid for with
unjust deaths.  But a person's greatness lies elsewhere.  It lies in their
decision to be stronger than their condition.  And if their condition is unjust,
they have only one way of overcoming it, which is to be just themself.

<p><small>I wonder what may have emerged were I to have kept the original randomness.
Some of my favorite characters have been generated via 3d6 down the line.</small></p>
</aside>

<p>I’m going to re-arrange the order of quotes a bit to see how they might create a
narrative flow of events that one could derive from their words.</p>
<p>After some thinking, here’s a framing outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Far from being disturbed…</li>
<li>Nothing is given to people…</li>
<li>The trial of heroes follows…</li>
<li>The apocalypse is always easier…</li>
<li>These are no wicked faces…</li>

<h2 id="reciting-the-story">Reciting the Story</h2>
<p>And from that I thought of writing a poem:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>Bells toll.<br />
Organs bellow.<br />
Preachers flap.<br />
(C)raven cawing.<br />
<br />
Communion given…<br />
   Received.<br />
Communion withheld…<br />
   Message received.<br />
<br />
Stone and glass,<br />
Light pours in;<br />
Warming glow.<br />
Hateful embers sparking.<br />
<br />
Shame imposed<br />
On bowing crown,<br />
Now rising;<br />
Leaving.<br />
There is nothing here,<br />
Save death.<br />
<br />
Fields free<br />
’midst joyous laughter;<br />
Of blossoms falling;<br />
Foxglove and ivy braiding;<br />
Barley golden turning.<br />
Eyes each other drinking.<br />
<br />
Truths unfurling<br />
Under night bannered sky;<br />
Dreams distant shimmering.<br />
Waxing heart.<br />
<br />
Feet dangling<br />
In river crisp and clear;<br />
Washing away yesteryear.<br />
<br />
Field stones gathered;<br />
A cairn of earthen skulls<br />
Marking these holy days<br />
of adjoinment and love.<br />
<br />
Harvest time.<br />
Reaper’s scythe.<br />
Pitch of night.<br />
Fork of tongue.<br />
All a Bible’s thumping.<br />
<br />
Stones cast;<br />
Feet dangling;<br />
Dead now dancing<br />
To crowd a chanting,<br />
Hissing, and cawing.<br />
<br />
Bones cast,<br />
Feet riven,<br />
Dance no more.<br />
<br />
Crowd in unison<br />
One in shape and thought.<br />
Together as one<br />
Each alone<br />
Withering<br />
  Dying<br />
    Dead<br />
(dead)<br />
<br />
Days march<br />
  (crumbling)<br />
Seasons turn<br />
  (dust)<br />
Ages pass<br />
  (gone)<br />
<br />
We sit transfixed, both you and I,<br />
As earthen mound<br />
Of Stone, moss and, ivy;<br />
True as bone, skin, and sinew,<br />
Hums this tale of yesteryore.<br />
For here the earth, sky, and river<br />
Remembers those that embraced<br />
Expanding ancient mysteries.<br /></p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>I wrote this poem in haste, spending 30 minutes or so.  As critique, it feels as
though I’m missing connections from poem to quotes; but on balance I feel this
game gave structure to synthesis and story-telling using, as rich compost, the
quotes I’ve collected in my reading.</p>
<p>In writing, there are a few callbacks to other passages and verses.  And one
over-arching biological reality that I believe is also a societal reality;
namely that mono-cultures invariably die.</p>
<p>We are all intertwined with each human and the natural world around us.  It
is a smothering of imagination, delivered by systems of power, that would have
us think otherwise.  We do not rise above the natural world, but are very much a
part of that web.  Not as a spider spinning and ensnaring, but as the filament
of that very beautiful complex glistening web.</p>
<p>Grandmother Spider, help me see beyond myself.  And thank you, Grandmother
Spider, for this web within which I write and worry, hope and dream.</p>
