<blockquote>
  <p>President Donald Trump has done what he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/18/politics/trump-peacemaker-iran-israel-conflict-analysis">swore</a> he would not
do: involve the United States in a war in the Middle East. His
supporters will tie themselves in knots (as Vice President J. D.
Vance <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1934996183702704404">did</a> last week) trying to jam the square peg of
Trump’s promises into the round hole of his actions. And many of
them may avoid calling this “war” at all, even though that’s what
Trump himself <a href="https://x.com/trump_repost/status/1936580633775792406">called it tonight</a>. They will want to see it
as a quick win against an obstinate regime that will eventually
declare bygones and come to the table. But whether bombing Iran
was a good idea or a bad idea — and it could turn out to be
either, or both — it is war by any definition of the term, and
something Trump had vowed he would avoid. [...]</p>

<p>Only one outcome is certain: Hypocrisy in the region and around
the world will reach galactic levels as nations wring their hands
and silently pray that the B-2s carrying the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/20/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-fordo-bunker-buster-bomb.html">bunker-buster</a>
bombs did their job.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Five things to remember about war:</p>

<ol>
<li>Many things reported with confidence in the first hours and
days will turn out not to be true.</li>
<li>Whatever they say, the people who start wars are often thinking
chiefly about domestic politics.</li>
<li>The rationale given for a war will change over time, such that
actual success or failure in achieving a named objective is
less relevant than one might think.</li>
<li>Wars are unpredictable.</li>
<li>Wars are easy to start and hard to stop.</li>
</ol>
