<p>I didn’t realize how hard it would be to stop working. Im constantly CCed in emails and I see issues that need resolution and worried people who need help. This is a critical time at work, but it has been like this for a while and it’s not going to stop tomorrow. Trying hard not to answer and relax…</p>
