<blockquote>
  <p>Wednesday, as part of his ongoing war against Wikipedia because he
does not like his page, Elon Musk launched Grokipedia, a fully
AI-generated “encyclopedia” that serves no one and nothing other
than <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/elon-musk-and-the-rights-war-on-wikipedia/?ref=404media.co">the ego of the world’s richest man</a>. As others have
already pointed out, Grokipedia seeks to be a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-launches-grokipedia-wikipedia-competitor/?ref=404media.co">right wing,
anti-woke Wikipedia competitor</a>. But to even call it a
Wikipedia competitor is to give the half-assed project too much
credit. It is not a Wikipedia “competitor” at all. It is a fully
robotic, heartless regurgitation machine that cynically and
indiscriminately sucks up the work of humanity to serve the
interests, protect the ego, amplify the viewpoints, and further
enrich the world’s wealthiest man. It is a totem of what Wikipedia
could and would become if you were to strip all the humans out and
hand it over to a robot; in that sense, Grokipedia is a useful
warning because of the constant pressure and <a href="https://www.404media.co/jimmy-wales-wikipedia-ai-chatgpt/">attacks by AI slop
purveyors</a> to push <a href="https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-pauses-ai-generated-summaries-after-editor-backlash/">AI-generated content into
Wikipedia</a>. And it is only getting attention, of course,
because Elon Musk <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/elon-musk-and-the-rights-war-on-wikipedia/?ref=404media.co">does represent an actual threat to
Wikipedia</a> through his <a href="https://www.404media.co/wikipedia-prepares-for-increase-in-threats-to-us-editors-from-musk-and-his-allies/">political power, wealth, and
obsession with the website</a>, as well as the fact that he
owns a huge social media platform.</p>

<p>In season 10 of <em><a href="https://www.hbomax.com/shows/curb-your-enthusiasm/18a0993f-209a-4653-8f94-f3fb8422e678">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></em>, Larry David gets into an argument with Mocha Joe, the owner of an eponymous coffee shop. David leases the space next door and opens Latte Larry’s, a copycat “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVQp9vSytOE">spite store</a>” cafe. Grokipedia reminds me of this, except that Larry David is genuinely funny and (in real life, as opposed to his <em>Curb</em> alter ego) at least somewhat self-aware.</p>
