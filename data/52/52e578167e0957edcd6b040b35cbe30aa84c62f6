Father,
</p>

 <p>
In the blindness of our arrogance, <br></br>
we think that we are free, <br></br>
yet, so often, we are in chains, <br></br>
slaves to the satisfaction of our own desires, <br></br>
and to the pursuit of our own selfish ends. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Our prayer today is that <br></br>
we may be transformed, <br></br>
freed, so that we may <br></br>
live as Christ lived, <br></br>
and love as he loved, <br></br>
every moment of our lives <br></br>
an act of restoration and redemption, <br></br>
and our faith a witness to <br></br>
coming of the Kingdom of God, <br></br>
when the justice of the Father <br></br>
and the love of the Son, <br></br>
rule together with the power of the Spirit. <br></br>
in perfect fullness and harmony.
</p>

 <p>
Let these gifts today be <br></br>
the first acts of our new lives. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
