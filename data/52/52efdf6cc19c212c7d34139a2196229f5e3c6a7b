<p>Mark Wilson, writing for Fast Company:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pope Francis’s tomb is simple by design. Francis — a modest man
who opted to live in humble quarters alongside his peers rather
than in the Vatican’s official housing for the leader of the
church — requested nothing more than his name and a cross to
<a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2025-04/popes-tomb-reads-franciscus.html">adorn regional marble</a> (“the stone of Liguria, the land of
his grandparents”). Vatican News goes as far as to position this
stone, not the most premium, as “the people’s stone.”</p>

<p>It really is quietly beautiful. But atop that marble is a tomb
inscribed with the name “Franciscus.” Or what — due to terrible
spacing between letters, known as kerning — reads something more
like “F R A NCIS VS.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fast Company’s headline reads “The Kerning on the Pope’s Tomb Is a Travesty”, but <em>travesty</em> is not the right word. The right word is <em>sin</em>.</p>
