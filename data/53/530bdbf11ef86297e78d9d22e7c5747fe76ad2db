<p>This week I created a custom build of the <a href="https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka">Iosevka</a> font. I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://input.djr.com/">Input Mono</a> for a long time now, and was very happy with it. However, it was missing a few glyphs that I wanted to use. Moreover, I didn&rsquo;t have a license for the Input font to use on e.g. my blog. Iosevka is <a href="https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/blob/master/doc/custom-build.md">stupendously customizable</a>, so I thought I&rsquo;d see if I could get something close to Input&rsquo;s styles.</p>
<p>Iosevka&rsquo;s default style is <em>extremely</em> narrow. However, I discovered that the width of Iosevka <em>extended</em> at 13pt matched Input at 12pt exactly. Here&rsquo;s a side-by-side comparison: the first picture is with Input Mono, and the second is with my new <a href="https://codeberg.org/ashton314/iosevka-output">Iosevka Output</a> font:</p>

<p>I loose a few lines with the Iosevka font, but that&rsquo;s a deliberate choice as its ascenders are pretty tall. I originally had <code>leading = 1100</code> in the build plan, which matched Input exactly, but I decided that this was more legible.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that hard either. Turns out, there&rsquo;s a predefined stylistic set (<code>ss18</code>) that matches almost all the Input characters well. Some features that I made sure were present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-storey <code>a</code> and <code>g</code>: I find this more legible as I don&rsquo;t mistake these characters for <code>o</code> or <code>y</code> respectively.</li>
<li>Tailed-and-serif <code>l</code>: the curved bottom differentiates it clearly from <code>1</code> or <code>I</code>.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Term&rdquo;-style spacing: I didn&rsquo;t like characters such as <code>→</code> taking up more than a single character&rsquo;s width. Looks pretty, but messes up some of my UI elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few more tweaks that I&rsquo;ve made to the font, and I&rsquo;m likely to tweak it some more. I&rsquo;m still getting used to this Iosevka style, but I&rsquo;m going to drive it for a week or so to give it a fair shake. It&rsquo;s growing on me for sure.</p>
<p>If you want to try it out, head over to <a href="https://codeberg.org/ashton314/iosevka-output/">my Codeberg repo</a> and download the build artifact.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need <code>nodejs</code> (ugh) and <code>ttfautohint</code> installed. See the <a href="https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/blob/master/doc/custom-build.md">docs for custom Iosevka builds</a> for more details.</p>
<p>When you clone the Iosevka repository, be sure to not clone all 20 Gb of history:</p>
