It&rsquo;s a lazy Sunday and there&rsquo;s nothing much going on in the Internet to interest Irreal or its readers so I&rsquo;m offering you this little nugget that popped up this morning. <a href="https://github.com/yibie/Oil.el/blob/main/readme.md">Oil.el</a> is a tiny package that brings the functionality of <code>Oil.nvim</code> to Emacs.
</p>
<p>
The idea is that you can batch create files in a given directory by simply listing their names, one per line, into the app. When you&rsquo;re done, simply type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> and the files are created. Or, you can cancel the operation with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s not clear to me why this app is as popular as it seems to be—at least in the Vim world. It&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with the app itself, I just don&rsquo;t see the need for it, especially given the existence of Dired. Nonetheless, Emacs is all about letting you have it your way so if Oil&rsquo;s workflow appeals to you, its existence is a good thing.

<p>
The package is not (yet?) on Melpa but you can download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/yibie/Oil.el/blob/main/oil.el">GitHub</a> if you&rsquo;re interested. I&rsquo;m guessing that this app will be mostly of value to refuges from Vim who are used to its Vim analog. Regardless, it&rsquo;s there for you if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
