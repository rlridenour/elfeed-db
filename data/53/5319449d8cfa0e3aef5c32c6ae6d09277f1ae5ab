<p>FIFA president Gianni Infantino presented President Donald Trump with the organization’s first-ever FIFA Peace Prize during the 2026 World Cup draw ceremony in Washington, honoring what FIFA described as his efforts to promote peace and unity globally and to help negotiate a Gaza ceasefire. The prize consists of a gold-colored medal, a trophy and a certificate, and comes after Infantino previously said he believed Trump should have received the Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomatic role in Middle East talks. Trump, who has long expressed interest in major international peace honors, called the FIFA recognition &quot;one of the greatest honours&quot; of his life while telling the audience he did not travel to the draw expecting to receive an award. The decision has sparked debate over FIFA’s neutrality and mandate, with supporters highlighting football’s capacity to foster peace and critics questioning whether a sports body should create such an award and grant its inaugural edition to a sitting U.S. president with close ties to Infantino.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/82pQ0UJJTPGAMM_nPr-tHN7XQ5FKB5FK2TtVGzAZD9aWl7LV6eeiQrSAupw8znRqtOQu_tUNmVtkEX7TMRHGE7edjESq8ce2ttWL-yZHu7WGKziIXQCU-I-2srQ7ENlpUKIVx2HT0i8m6mIM81mYjRSHbxAMKk7uHpbRhcLIfI--iDip_U_ANNujRqSAi5tsdmeGoM4noyw' alt='President Trump with FIFA president Gianni Infantino and a World Cup trophy replica at the White House earlier in his term.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Award details: The inaugural FIFA Peace Prize came with a &quot;beautiful medal,&quot; a gold trophy and a framed certificate praising Trump’s work to &quot;promote peace and unity around the world&quot; during the World Cup draw show.</li><li>Infantino’s rationale: Gianni Infantino has publicly argued that Trump merited a top peace accolade for his role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire and framed the FIFA prize as recognition of those efforts in front of a global football audience.</li><li>Ceremony atmosphere: The draw event had a festive tone, with Trump dancing along to &quot;YMCA&quot; and repeatedly taking center stage as cameras focused on him throughout the show.</li><li>World Cup context: Infantino has cultivated a close relationship with Trump in part to ensure political and logistical backing for the expanded 2026 World Cup, which the United States is co-hosting and whose group-stage matchups were being set at the same ceremony.</li><li>Critics’ concerns: Some commentators and fans questioned whether introducing a peace prize linked to a sitting leader aligns with FIFA’s responsibility to remain neutral and focused on football administration.</li></ul><blockquote>This is truly one of the great honours of my life - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: Trump described the FIFA Peace Prize as one of the greatest honours of his life and said he had come to the draw for football, not expecting to receive any personal award.
