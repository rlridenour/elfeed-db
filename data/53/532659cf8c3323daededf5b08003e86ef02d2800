The first reviews of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-announces-iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> have been published by selected media outlets and YouTube channels, offering a closer look at the device ahead of its launch on Friday.<br/>

The main attraction of the iPhone Air is its ultra-thin 5.6mm design, but the device has a handful of compromises compared to the iPhone 17 Pro models, so is it still worth buying? The reviews set out to answer that question.<br/>
<br/>
The compromises compared to the Pro models include shorter battery life, no Telephoto camera with up to 8× optical zoom, one speaker instead of two, a slower USB-C port for wired data transfer speeds, slightly lower maximum USB-C and MagSafe charging speeds, and a slightly slower 5-core GPU instead of a 6-core GPU.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the iPhone Air has some Pro features, including a ProMotion display with up to a 120Hz refresh rate, and an A19 Pro chip with the same 6-core CPU. The device also has a sleek, premium design with Ceramic Shield glass and titanium.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone Air can be pre-ordered now. Below, we have rounded up some of the reviews.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the iPhone Air offers up to 27 hours of video playback per charge, compared to up to 33 hours on the iPhone 17 Pro and up to 39 hours on the iPhone 17 Pro Max. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/779588/apple-iphone-air-review-battery-camera"><em>The Verge</em>'s Allison Johnson</a> on battery life:<blockquote>Now for the less-good news: battery life is just okay. And honestly, that's a pretty good outcome for the Air; the situation could have been worse. If you're a light user and you spend most of your time on Wi-Fi, you might never have a problem with the battery.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, it makes me a little too anxious to see that battery indicator drop into the 20s before dinnertime, though in fairness I was going pretty hard on the battery with around five hours of screen-on time. On a much lighter day on my home Wi-Fi, three hours of screen-on time took the battery down to around 40 percent by bedtime. I'd call that within the bounds of acceptable, if a little on the low end for a &#36;1,000 phone.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.wired.com/review/apple-iphone-air/"><em>WIRED</em>'s Julian Chokkattu</a> on battery life:<blockquote>The battery life of the iPhone Air is better than I expected.<br/>
<br/>
The Air was generally able to last a full day with average use for me. I hit around five hours of screen-on time with around 18 percent left by 10:30 pm. This worked for me, but my expectations were also very low. I had to baby the battery so much on the last ultrathin phone I tested, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, and I was surprised to find that this was not the case with the Air.<br/>
<br/>
Heavy users will undoubtedly need to top up this phone during the day. On one travel day, I took the phone off the charger at 5:30 am and used it extensively for navigation, music streaming, phone calls, and Instagram Reeling, and I hit 2 percent by 4:30 pm. If that sounds like a very normal day for you, you'll most certainly feel the limits of this phone's battery life. For the most part, I didn't feel as battery anxious as with Samsung's thin phone.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Like the iPhone 17 Pro models, the iPhone Air has an A19 Pro chip, with the same 6-core CPU but a slightly reduced 5-core GPU. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/10/iphone-17-pro-iphone-air-a19-pro-benchmarks/">Geekbench results</a> for the chip already surfaced last week, and now one review has subjected it to additional testing.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-air-review"><em>Tom's Guide</em>'s Mark Spoonauer</a> on sustained performance and thermal management:<blockquote>How about sustained performance? To test that, we used the 3DMark Wild Life Extreme Stress Test, which simulates gaming for about 20 minutes. We ran it once and recorded the results, then did a second run right after that to really stress test these phones.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone Air performed quite well, with stability scores that beat the Galaxy S25 Edge by a fair margin in both rounds.<br/>
<br/>
More surprisingly, the iPhone Air turned in cooler temperatures than the Pro Max when we measured the back of the phones using a laser thermometer in 5 locations and averaged the results. Though the S25 Edge was even cooler.</blockquote>Notably, Spoonauer was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/11/iphone-air-durability-interview/">unable to bend the iPhone Air with his hands</a> in a recent interview, but we will see how the device holds up in pockets over the long term.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-iphone-air-review/"><em>CNET</em>'s Abrar Al-Heeti</a> tested the iPhone Air's single 48-megapixel rear camera — the review contains a gallery of photos shot with the device:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>It felt surprisingly limiting to not have an ultrawide camera, especially when I wanted to capture more sweeping landscapes. Not to turn this into a thin phone showdown, but I couldn't help but think of how the Galaxy S25 Edge does have a 12-megapixel ultrawide-angle camera, alongside a 200-megapixel wide-angle camera, which makes it feel like less of a compromise in that regard. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, the rear camera on the iPhone Air consistently delivered. In the many pictures I took of waterfalls, tea times and urban landscapes, shadows and highlights are well balanced, colors are true to life, and there's an overall sharpness and clarity. Portrait shots (my go-to camera mode) capably blur backgrounds to help subjects -- whether it's a decadent tea tray, an art installation or CNET's talented Jesse Orrall -- stand out.</blockquote><h2>Videos</h2><br/>
