<p>An explosion outside a district court entrance in Islamabad on 11 November 2025 killed multiple people and wounded others, with several outlets reporting at least 12 fatalities and others citing lower initial tolls. Reports differed in early counts and injury totals as police and emergency services worked at the scene, with some outlets initially reporting five or six deaths and varying numbers of wounded. The blast occurred near the court entrance where litigants typically gather, and authorities have launched an investigation into the attack while no group had immediately claimed responsibility in initial reporting.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/0raTcO1GkcUMNh4vBzuMr0COpUGdf1G0zkhY6c7z0ZD-XosEykvtUVQitLqSV3NAjtywOhFjBN9XIuRKjskW1JfWoPl_a-tnCk0RLQg-pDNs9sSuQj6bMAxKOArxTJz_rXcu71TEbxkICMMX_uP-Ck5T8QDPtD6i5lVZqhQ1pmg7bzxYjPytOnYeuKSsmqX9570kRNWcIr4FX68_NA6i2_96rGke8E33uc9gaglKctzhPXK5YCL5tf28W820' alt='Police officers and ambulances attended the scene of the explosion in Islamabad, Pakistan.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Conflicting counts: Different news teams reported varying death tolls early — ABC said five dead, Firstpost cited six, while several outlets and officials later reported about a dozen fatalities, illustrating the chaos of the immediate aftermath.</li><li>Timing context: The attack came days after the third round of talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban, a context highlighted by some outlets as politically sensitive though no direct link was claimed in reporting.</li><li>Emergency response: Police, ambulances and forensic teams attended the scene and hospitals received casualties as authorities cordoned the area and began on-site investigations.</li><li>Victim profile: Local reporting said many of the casualties appeared to be passers-by or people who had come for court hearings rather than court staff or officials, underlining the risk to civilians near busy public buildings.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pakistan interior minister: The interior minister described the blast as a suicide attack and provided a higher fatality figure in initial official statements, signalling a major security incident under inquiry.
