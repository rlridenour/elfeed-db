<p id="p2">As we head into the final weeks of 2025, Federico and I figured it would be a good time to update <a href="https://www.macstories.net/setups" rel="noopener noreferrer">the MacStories Setups page</a>. There&rsquo;s an ebb and flow to the gear and apps we test each year, and as the fall OS update season fades into the past, it&rsquo;s not unusual for one or both of us to take stock of our setup and make changes. That&rsquo;s been very true for both of us this year, but in different ways.</p>
<p id="p3">Federico has been focused on simplifying his hardware setup and testing a long list of apps and services. In contrast, I&rsquo;ve made fewer gear cuts, focusing more on strategic changes to the gadgets I use and settling on a core set of work apps.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RhQhl_QuJI?si=H_6iEFjotw57yn4L" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p id="p5">The result is that Federico&rsquo;s hardware setup changes have primarily been updates to his Apple and portable gaming gear. He made the transition from the iPhone 16 Pro Max to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-air/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone Air</a>, and couldn&rsquo;t be happier with the result. He also replaced the M4 iPad Pro with <a href="https://amzn.to/4o3AiZo" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latest M5 model</a> and moved from the <a href="https://amzn.to/3LDQiEd" rel="noopener noreferrer">AirPods 4 to the AirPods Pro 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p6">Both of us ditched our previous Apple Vision Pro head strap solutions for <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/dual-knit-band-sa/apple-vision-pro-dual-knit-band" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Apple Dual Knit Band</a>, which has been a big upgrade. It&rsquo;s comfortable, and having one dial to adjust both bands is both clever and far simpler than other solutions I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>

<p id="p8">Federico also added the <a href="https://www.ayntec.com/products/ayn-thor" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ayn Thor</a> to his handheld gaming lineup. The Thor, which I also bought this fall, is a dual-screen OLED gaming handheld that runs Android. It&rsquo;s perfect for emulating dual-screen systems like the Nintendo DS and 3DS, but it has also been excellent for game streaming and testing the emerging world of emulating SteamOS on Android. If game tinkering is your thing and this sounds intriguing, we have <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/npc-next-portable-console/id1749770019?i=1000733888044" rel="noopener noreferrer">two episodes</a> <a href="https://apple.co/3LoDGjV" rel="noopener noreferrer">of NPC: Next Portable Console</a> that go in-depth on the Ayn Thor.</p>
<p id="p9"><!--more--></p>
<p id="p10">Among the many apps and services that Federico has settled on and that we&rsquo;ve been covering this fall on AppStories are:</p>
<ul id="ul11"><li><a href="https://claude.ai" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.typingmind.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">TypingMind</a></li>

</ul><div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/img_0434-1763479275576-1763492804519.JPG" alt="Yes, there's a lot going on at my desk."><p class="image-caption">Yes, there&rsquo;s a lot going on at my desk.</p></div>
<p id="p13">The story of my setup changes is a little different. I&rsquo;ve also updated my iPhone, although I&rsquo;ve stuck with the Pro Max, getting <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-17-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Deep Blue iPhone 17 Pro Max</a> with 512GB of storage. Plus, I updated from the original Apple Watch Ultra to the <a href="https://amzn.to/49mleCF" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Watch Ultra 3</a> and from the AirPods Pro 2 to the <a href="https://amzn.to/3LDQiEd" rel="noopener noreferrer">AirPods Pro 3</a>. It&rsquo;s been excellent to have two-day battery life with the Apple Watch Ultra again, and I love the better fit and sound I get from the AirPods Pro 3.</p>
<p id="p14">I&rsquo;m also a huge fan of the Ayn Thor dual-screen Android handheld. I&rsquo;ve tried so many handhelds since we started <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPC: Next Portable Console</a>, but nothing can beat the compact size and clamshell form factor of the Thor, which tops it all off with two gorgeous OLED screens. It&rsquo;s the closest thing to a perfect gaming handheld I&rsquo;ve tried.</p>
<p id="p15">Over the summer, I also started revisiting my smart home setup. This is a long-term project that I&rsquo;ll write about more in the new year, but I&rsquo;ve added several gadgets to my setup since our last update. The biggest addition is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3X31blo" rel="noopener noreferrer">Narwal Freo X10 Pro</a>, which the company sent me for testing and I will write about soon. It&rsquo;s a combo robot vacuum and mop that is light years ahead of the Roomba I bought several years ago in terms of its capabilities. I also wanted to highlight <a href="https://amzn.to/3M5K7sq" rel="noopener noreferrer">SwitchBot&rsquo;s Smart Desk Fan</a>, which I got at the end of the summer to help cool my office. The thing I appreciate most about it is that I can control it from the buttons on the fan itself, with a remote control, or with an automation that I created to turn the fan on when the indoor temperature crosses a certain threshold.</p>

<p id="p17">The other highlights of my setup update all revolve around audio. First, I got a <a href="https://amzn.to/3JJIpfQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">MOTU M4 audio interface</a> for recording podcasts and videos for a very specific reason: it&rsquo;s the only USB-C-connected audio interface I could find that has an on/off switch. That way, I don&rsquo;t need to stare at its LED lights all day, and unlike the Elgato Wave XLR interface it replaces, the M4 doesn&rsquo;t needlessly generate heat.</p>
<p id="p18">For personal audio, I also recently picked up the <a href="https://amzn.to/481FKWV" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beats Studio Pro headphones</a> when they were on sale. I love my AirPods Pro 3, but I&rsquo;m not a fan of having them jammed in my ears for long stretches. With the Beats Studio Pro, I now have the option to work at my desk or do other things around the house without the AirPods Pro in my ears, and they have great battery life, too.</p>
