<p>Cameroon voted on Sunday in a presidential election as Paul Biya, 92, the world’s oldest serving head of state, sought an eighth term that would extend his 43 years in power [aljazeera.com#1][france24.com#1][theguardian.com#1]. The field of challengers is fragmented, with multiple opposition candidates standing against him [theguardian.com#1][france24.com#1]. Just over 8 million of the country’s roughly 30 million people have registered to vote, according to local reporting [straitstimes.com#1]. A victory would mean another seven-year term, and Biya has campaigned sparingly, holding a single rally and promising that “the best is still to come” [france24.com#1][nytimes.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/TIeq8fdK8_bzH0c0eKwTzeQM3ruOmHoifjRv2TYHKFapJYz0PCtttRTcbDGmUpW27M_jwGyV9wVBojVggcyYZAmE7MSqOifzzDjn-95k1d0MpjKctOQ-fQkWAgs0UCL93WN_NtK9dXAaF82qfBBs9JumuB0S3yZxzldNFeu1KRdlAqTSxe9woO1MoaPdowa6zytiF9KgeFH9xw_c1_xrUSYILrbkmkhfF-WaRu2J' alt='President Paul Biya of Cameroon at the only rally of his re-election campaign, in Maroua.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Age and tenure: At 92, Paul Biya is the world’s oldest serving head of state and has led Cameroon for 43 years [aljazeera.com#1][france24.com#1].</li><li>Opposition field: A fractured opposition featuring multiple candidates is challenging Biya’s bid for reelection [theguardian.com#1][france24.com#1].</li><li>Voter roll: Just over 8 million Cameroonians have registered to vote out of a population of about 30 million [straitstimes.com#1].</li><li>Polling day: Polls opened nationwide on Sunday as Cameroonians cast ballots for president [france24.com#1][reuters.com#1].</li><li>Campaign message: Biya held a single campaign rally in Maroua, pledging to improve unemployment and poverty and saying “the best is still to come” [nytimes.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>The best is still to come. - Paul Biya</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Paul Biya: Biya emphasizes continuity, promising economic improvements and assuring supporters that &quot;the best is still to come.&quot;.
