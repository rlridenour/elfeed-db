<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>Today for a short and simple one.</p>
<p>I like <em>Safari</em> as a browser. I like using default macOS applications as much as possible. <em>Safari</em> is built-in into macOS and I have been using it for decades without missing any functionality. Granted, I am not web developer, I don&rsquo;t need much plugins or extensions.</p>
<p>One thing annoys me though. By defaults the menu for emptying the cache is not active. At some point in the OSX/macOS Upgrades it got hidden from the default menu. Emptying the browser cache is useful of course, when one is blogging – I use <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> – to preview changes on the sites.
I do not want to have false negatives in my changes, because the browser still has the old state in the cache.</p>

<p>Well to activate the menu is quite simple.</p>
<p>Got to the menu <em>Preferences&hellip;</em> (1 &amp; 2 in the image bellow) or just <code>⌘ + ,</code>. Select the <em>Advanced</em> (3) tab and the check the box for <em>Show Develop menu in menu bar</em> (4).</p>

<p>Now that the &ldquo;Develop&rdquo; menu is visible, emptying the cache is as simple as the following image shows. One can of course use the Keyboard shortcut <code>⌥ + ⌘ + E</code>.</p>
