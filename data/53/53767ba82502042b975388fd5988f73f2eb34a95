<p>I recently <a href="https://youtube.com/live/-wGXnY6Mdcw">demoed a python script</a> on my YouTube channel for analyzing git commits and extracting writing stats. This script is ideal for daily writing output analysis and planning.</p>
<p>As promised, I wanted to drop the full text I was using for the demonstration. <a href="https://chrismaiorana.com/git-guides/daily-writing-summary-python-script/">You can find it here</a>.</p>
<p>As always, this stuff is just for educational purposes and not offered with any kind of guarantee that will run properly on your own system. So, as always, run at your own risk. The script does not write any information into the file system or require any special privileges. It merely looks back at git commits made over the current day and provides some analysis.</p>
<p>What I particularly like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#8220;edit ratio&#8221; feature: this nifty little tool tells you how much you wrote (added) versus what you edited (deleted). I intended for this feature to give the writer a clearer view of their habits. Is he writing more than editing, or editing more than writing?</li>
<li>The writing streak: keep a count of how many days consecutive days you&#8217;ve made commits on your writing project.</li>
<li>Commit and note messages: beyond your commit messages, you can leave extended notes to yourself about what you did in that commit.</li>
</ul>
<p>These procedures go along nicely the theory I write about at length in my <a href="https://chris-maiorana.kit.com/products/git-for-writers">Git For Writers</a> handbook, which I would encourage you to check out if you are high-performer writer interested in optimizing your writing output. Thanks for reading. See you next time.</p>
