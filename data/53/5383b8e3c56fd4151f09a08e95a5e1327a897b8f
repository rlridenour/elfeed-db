When <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/">unveiling the WWDC 2025 dates</a> today, Apple said that it will announce this year's Swift Student Challenge Winners on Thursday, March 27.<br/>

The Swift Student Challenge tasks students with creating an innovative coding project using Swift Playground or Xcode. This year's event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/03/swift-student-challenge-2025-live/">began on February 3</a>, and Apple accepted submissions for a three-week period before judging began.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to select 350 winners for the 2025 challenge, all of whom will be eligible to attend the June 9 Special Event for WWDC at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> campus in Cupertino, California. Winners will need to enter a lottery process to get a chance to attend.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will also choose 50 Distinguished Winners that will be recognized for "outstanding submissions." Distinguished Winners will be invited to Cupertino for a three-day experience that will include the Special Event keynote viewing along with other activities, and these winners will not need to enter the lottery to visit &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
Students who entered the challenge can expect to receive an email notifying them about their status later this week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/2025-swift-student-challenge-march-27/">Apple Announcing 2025 Swift Student Challenge Winners on March 27</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announcing-2025-swift-student-challenge-winners-on-march-27.2454056/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
