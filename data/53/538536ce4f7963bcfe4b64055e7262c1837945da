<p>China is recalculating its Venezuela strategy after US forces captured and removed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, an outcome Beijing condemned as a serious shock and setback for a key Latin American partner. The shift puts China’s outstanding Venezuela exposure—built largely on oil-backed lending—into uncertainty, while analysts still expect Venezuelan crude exports to continue because any new authorities would likely need fast revenue. Across coverage, writers frame the moment as both a risk to Chinese interests and a real-world test of how President Trump’s foreign-policy approach—often described as favoring clearer “spheres of influence”—could reshape great-power competition in the Americas.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/-gTr7270CtjrE4MWJ2_oeZ-F12qJ1-R2OHVBgW2A7PGla-BWo3GdEKIvbVxMvlExRsYjGbjL2XmlSqXmA9q89knB1BpuqL-ghSw5pnTThKd2X3acyvW4cFxr9ZSMUleDJDjeprQGQGNVWfPn29aBv4uL0mUj8atidwi5YOpgYJHxZG7tfsBaW4wSqTzzk0IiIcP8y58QIUTZAvwbHFG6HH1k-EhAnlh6jKw3OFhe8xnZzu5lpcYEFBULGjHB' alt='Photo used to illustrate US-Venezuela developments tied to Venezuela’s external alignments.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Oil-loan exposure: AidData estimates Beijing’s remaining exposure in Venezuela at about US$10 billion, largely tied to oil-for-loan arrangements now left in limbo after Maduro’s removal.</li><li>Trade pivot: Data-focused reporting shows Venezuela has increasingly shifted trade, arms ties, and aid links away from the US and toward China in recent years.</li><li>China’s leverage: Deutsche Welle reports that while Beijing expressed strong condemnation, it may also try to use the episode—described as Maduro’s “kidnapping”—to advance its broader messaging and interests in its rivalry with Washington.</li><li>Regional financing: ABC notes China has poured billions into Latin America and remained one of the loudest critics of Washington’s move against Maduro, but has so far stopped short of actions beyond condemnation.</li><li>Wider supply fears: The Financial Times reports Chinese producers worry that similar US intervention in Iran could disrupt access to discounted crude supplies, making Venezuela feel like part of a bigger energy-security question.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Chinese government and analysts: Beijing condemned the US action and now faces uncertainty over loans and influence in Venezuela, even as analysts expect oil exports to keep flowing because a new government would need quick revenue.
