<p> As we are now full swing into New Years resolution season, I&rsquo;m sure you are all thinking about getting your fitness game in order. If not, then why not? </p>
<p> For the past seven years I&rsquo;ve carried a little notebook for tracking workouts and exercises at home or at the gym. What I love about the notebook is: I don&rsquo;t have to think about what to do at the gym because it&rsquo;s already written down, I can see what I did last time and make adjustments as needed, and I don&rsquo;t have to carry my phone. </p>
<p> But recently, I wanted to see if I could take recent notebook data, put it into Org Mode, and see if I could better spot trends using historic data. </p>
<p> The notebook is easy for capturing data in the moment, but for processing later I needed something that does a little math. </p>
<p> With Org Mode, I can transfer the data from the notebook to a digital medium, and then do some nice post-processing to visualize the results. </p>
<p> I did a <a href="https://youtu.be/3b7HJgYCzzI">video demonstrating this</a>, and if you&rsquo;d like to see the code, I <a href="https://github.com/cryptstopher/org-mode-workout-tracker">put it on GitHub here</a>. This code is just an example of what can be done. Something like this would likely require some adjustment to connect with your personal workout routine. </p>
