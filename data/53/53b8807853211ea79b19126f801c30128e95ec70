<p>LLM chats are often handy for refining answers to a question or task, part of a bigger goal. Navigating the chat transcript, copying and pasting, can be a frequent operation in the bigger goal. If we can do it more efficiently, the better.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues">chatgpt-shell</a> offered <code>chatgpt-shell-next-item</code> and <code>chatgpt-shell-previous-item</code> commands, it had a few rough edges which prevented me from fully adopting. The default bindings <code>C-c C-n</code> and <code>C-c C-p</code> didn't exactly help either, making repeated navigation fairly clunky. <a href="https://karthinks.com/software/it-bears-repeating/">repeat-mode</a> would have helped a little, yet I was yearning for a familiar experience… more like <code>tab</code> and <code>Shift-tab</code> in web browsers.</p>
<p>While shells often <code>tab</code>-complete commands and/or arguments, I'm not super convinced <code>tab</code> completion is a good candidate for an LLM Emacs shell. Having said that, searching for previous prompts a la <code>Ctr-r</code> is indeed a handy feature and already supported in <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues">chatgpt-shell</a> (via <code>M-r</code>).</p>
<p>This is all to say that the with the latest <code>chatgpt-shell</code> navigation changes (using <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;backtab&gt;</code> bindings), the <code>chatgpt-shell</code> experience feels way more natural. You can see it in action…</p>

<p>Tab navigation jumps between prompts, links, and code blocks. You may have noticed code blocks are automatically selected, in case you want to quickly copy and paste elsewhere.</p>
<p>This mode of navigation is also present in the <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model#a-shell-hybrid">compose UX</a> (via M-x <code>chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose</code>). In addition to <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;backtab&gt;</code>, you can use <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> bindings (post prompt submission).</p>

<p>Give the new navigation a try. See how it feels. Some of it is fairly fresh, so <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues/new">please file bugs if needed</a>.</p>
