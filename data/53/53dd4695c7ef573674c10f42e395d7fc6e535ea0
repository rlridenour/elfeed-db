<p>SATCOM Security — a team of researchers from UC San Diego and the University of Maryland:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We pointed a commercial-off-the-shelf satellite dish at the sky
and carried out the most comprehensive public study to date of
geostationary satellite communication. A shockingly large amount
of sensitive traffic is being broadcast unencrypted, including
critical infrastructure, internal corporate and government
communications, private citizens’ voice calls and SMS, and
consumer Internet traffic from in-flight Wi-Fi and mobile
networks. This data can be passively observed by anyone with a few
hundred dollars of consumer-grade hardware. There are thousands of
geostationary satellite transponders globally, and data from a
single transponder may be visible from an area as large as 40% of
the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>The researchers don’t mention RCS by name, only SMS, but this is a perfect example of why I thought <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/16/apple-rcs">Apple’s original stance on RCS</a> was correct, and their <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/eu_rcs_imessage">change of heart to support it last year</a> was unfortunate. No new protocol for messaging should be adopted unless the protocol exclusively works using end-to-end encryption.</p>
