<p>Is there a German word for a feeling that combines admiration, weariness, and a touch of disgust? That word would be handy as we continue to catalog attempts to teach in a world of artificial intelligence, such as this one from professor of technology and business <a href="https://ipeirotis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panos Ipeirotis</a> (NYU).<span id="more-56190"></span></p>

<p>As students are increasingly tempted to use AI to read assigned texts and write assigned papers, many professors are increasingly desperate for ways to ensure their students are actually learning.</p>
<p>A popular recommendation is the oral exam. Have a conversation with the student in an AI-free environment in which their learning can be assessed. It sounds like a good option, and it often is. (I&#8217;ve used them myself over the past few years.)</p>
<p>But the problem is that they don&#8217;t scale. If you have too many students, you won&#8217;t have enough time to give oral exams (and certainly not enough time to give each student multiple such exams during the course, which is probably much more effective at incentivizing learning than just one).</p>
<p>What to do? Here&#8217;s Professor Ipeirotis&#8217;s idea: <a href="https://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2025/12/fighting-fire-with-fire-scalable-oral.html?m=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have an AI conduct the oral exam</a>!</p>
<p>And so he developed an AI examiner, and tried it out:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We used ElevenLabs Conversational AI to build the examiner. The platform bundles the messy parts (speech-to-text, text-to-speech, turn-taking, interruption handling, …) into something usable. And here is the thing that surprised me: a basic version for a low-stakes setting (e.g., an assignment) can be up and running in literally minutes. Minutes. Just write a prompt describing what the agent should ask the student, and you are done.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Two features mattered a lot for our setup:</em></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Dynamic variables:</strong> pass the student&#8217;s name, project details, and other per-student context into the conversation as parameters, to allow <b>personalized </b>exams</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Workflows:</strong> build a structured flow with sub-agents instead of a single &#8220;chatty&#8221; agent trying to do everything</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div>Here&#8217;s what the exam was like:</div>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We ran a two-part oral exam.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>Part 1: &#8220;Talk me through your project.&#8221;</strong> The agent asks about the student&#8217;s capstone project: goals, data, modeling choices, evaluation, failure modes. This is where the &#8220;LLM did my homework&#8221; strategy dies. You can paste an assignment into ChatGPT. It is much harder to improvise consistent answers about specific decisions when someone is drilling into details.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>Part 2: &#8220;Now do a case.&#8221;</strong> The agent picks one of the cases we discussed in class and asks questions spanning the topics we covered: basically testing whether students absorbed the material or just showed up.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>To handle this structure, we split the exam into sub-agents in a workflow:</em></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Authentication agent:</strong> Asks for the student&#8217;s ID and refuses to proceed without a valid one. (In a more productized version, we would integrate with NYU SSO instead of checking against a list.)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Project discussion agent:</strong> Gets project context injected via parameters. The prompt includes details of each project so the agent can ask informed questions. The next step is obvious: connect retrieval over the student&#8217;s submitted slides and reports so the agent can quote and probe precisely.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Case discussion agent:</strong> Selects a case and runs structured questioning. Again, RAG would help with richer case details.</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>This &#8220;many small agents&#8221; approach is not just aesthetic. It prevents the system from drifting into unbounded conversation, and it makes debugging possible.</em></p>
<p>Each exam generated a transcript which was then graded by a &#8220;council of LLMs&#8221;:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Three models (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) assessed each transcript independently. Then they saw each other&#8217;s assessments and revised. Finally, the chair (Claude) synthesized the final grade with evidence.</em></p>
<p>And how was the grading?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The grading was stricter than my own default&#8230; The feedback was better than any human would produce.</em></p>
<p>You can read all about the experiment <strong><a href="https://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2025/12/fighting-fire-with-fire-scalable-oral.html?m=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></strong>, including what Ipeirotis learned from it, what the students thought, and what he&#8217;d do differently next time. You can also try out taking the exam.</p>
