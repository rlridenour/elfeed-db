<p>A violent riot at the Machala prison in El Oro province, Ecuador, on Sunday left at least 31 inmates dead and dozens wounded, officials and media reported. Authorities said four inmates were shot dead during an armed confrontation earlier in the morning and later 27 prisoners were found dead by asphyxiation, a finding now under forensic review. Prison officials and forensic teams said they are still working to fully clarify the circumstances of the asphyxiations while investigations continue. The episode is the latest in a years-long pattern of deadly unrest and gang-related violence inside Ecuador’s prisons.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/zBaGaHKQ-axWkUBG1aHTUspSHOI7kIk6XykQo_J758WCF8ekY4f2yrYBVRs5VBlIxjNf5SJez9MpycUnXIEcuQk6hLnHvK8pgh1m2nqUe3tcBTe5IbHmNauhLPmPoVIJ84AqauwK3Wb0Www' alt='Ecuador prison riot leaves 4 inmates dead and dozens injured' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Official findings: Prison authorities reported 27 inmates were discovered dead from asphyxiation described as &#x27;suspension,&#x27; a detail officials say requires forensic confirmation.</li><li>Armed confrontation: Officials said an armed riot earlier in the day left four inmates shot dead and dozens more injured during clashes inside the facility.</li><li>Ongoing investigations: Forensic medical teams and investigators were deployed to the Machala site as authorities said they continue working to &#x27;fully clarify the facts&#x27; surrounding the deaths.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ecuadorian prison authorities: Authorities reported that 27 inmates were found dead by asphyxiation and said investigators and forensic teams are working to clarify how those deaths occurred.
