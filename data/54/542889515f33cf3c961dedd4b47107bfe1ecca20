A couple of weeks ago, I <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13478">wrote about Tsoding&rsquo;s video on the annoying usefulness of Emacs</a>. His conclusion was that you should stay away from Emacs because once you try it, you will never be able to break free.
</p>
<p>
Now Valigo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FupJOKR3WeA">has his own video up that reaches the same conclusion</a>. For him, the main attraction of Emacs is it&rsquo;s extensibility and customizability. The reason for that, of course, is that the Emacs executable is basically a Lisp image with the source code available from within that image. That means that you can, if needed, reach into the guts of Emacs and change just about any aspect of Emacs on the fly. The only exception is the small C core and even that has the source code available from within Emacs but you&rsquo;d have to recompile Emacs to change it.
</p>
<p>
One telling example that Valigo gives is to ask Emacs for the definition of the <code>j</code> key. Because he has evil mode enabled, Emacs reports that <code>j</code> runs the command <code>evil-next-line</code>. Then he disables evil mode and repeats the experiment. This time Emacs reports that <code>j</code> runs the <code>self-insert-command</code> to add a <code>j</code> to the buffer. The point is that the help command adapts itself on the fly to reflect the current state of the system.
</p>
<p>
Because of all this customizability, Emacs use is addictive. Once you start, you can&rsquo;t stop. Like Tsoding, Valigo says that Emacs is old and crufty but he can&rsquo;t escape because nothing else is as useful.
</p>
<p>
I get that Tsoding an Valigo are probably writing tongue in cheek but really, if Emacs is so useful you can&rsquo;t live without it, why are you complaining? You can, after all, change anything you don&rsquo;t like.</p>
