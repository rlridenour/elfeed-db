<li>Silly little gnomes</li>
<li>Actually, they’re kinda big (up to 17&quot; tall)</li>
<li>Some Christmas-y, some not</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: With products like this, we’re relying on you to have had a few margs <em>before</em> buying, not after</li>
</ul><h1>Cute L'il Guys</h1><p>“I will take the ring to Mordor!” said Frodo. Then, something occurred to him. “Though I do not know the way.”</p>
<p>“I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins,” said Gandalf, “as long as it is yours to bear.”</p>
<p>Aragorn stood now. “If by my life or death I can protect you, I will. You have my sword.”</p>
<p>“And you have my bow,” said Legolas.</p>
<p>“And my axe,” said Gimli.</p>
<p>“And our ability to cheekily enliven a garden or a front stoop,” came a chorus of small voices.</p>
<p>All assembled there turned their attention to the group of assorted Exhart Good Time Gnomes.</p>
<p>“Should I tell them?” Gandalf whispered.</p>
<p>“I think it would be best coming from Frodo,” Aragorn replied in a hush.</p>
<p>Frodo stepped forward. “Hey, guys,” he said, smiling, “you’ve been a <em>huge</em> help. Seriously. Without you, we wouldn’t have… uhh…”</p>
<p>“Laughed as much?” Legolas offered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” Gimli offered. “We really appreciated your sense of humor along the way.”</p>
<p>The gnomes beamed with pride.</p>
<p>“But, well,” Frodo went on, “we can’t bring you further, because things are about to get very serious.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t that mean you need us more than ever?” one of the gnomes said. “What if you come upon a flower patch that desperately needs a touch of personality? Or a deck upon which there’s only boring wrought iron furniture that tells you nothing of its owners zany side?”</p>
<p>“We’re just not really worried about that,” Gandalf said. “So, why don’t all of you guys stay here, okay? Maybe keep the mood light?”</p>
<p>The gnomes hung their heads. “Sure, that makes sense,” they said in unison, dejectedly.</p>
<p>Frodo and the others exchanged pained looks.</p>
<p>“Okay, fine,” Frodo said. “Maybe we could bring <em>one</em> of you.” He pointed to a gnome at random. “Why not you?”</p>

<p>The Eye of Sauron surveyed its kingdom. All was as expected, other than… wait, what was that? It narrowed its gaze at a strange sight.</p>
<p><em>Is that gnome over there,</em> it wondered to himself, <em>mooning me?</em></p>
<p>While the Eye of Sauron was thus distracted, the rest of the party was free to carry out their plan and defeat evil once and for all.</p>
