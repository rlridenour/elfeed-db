<p>A large pre-dawn police operation in Rio de Janeiro targeting the Comando Vermelho drug gang left more than 100 people dead and sparked street protests and calls for investigations . State authorities and watchdogs reported differing tolls — official counts issued by authorities put the number at least at 119, while state monitors and public defenders said it could be higher, up to 132, as bodies were recovered and identified . The raid, involving thousands of security personnel and supported by helicopters, drones and heavy policing tactics, led to dozens of arrests and fierce clashes in favela neighbourhoods, with residents later laying dozens of corpses in public streets to demand answers . Human rights groups and Brazil’s political leadership reacted strongly: rights organisations demanded independent investigations and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s office expressed horror at the toll, while critics called for accountability of the operation’s commanders .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/k_una0evhRj8faYsdevQx4dYlPIEeEFrGnV_k1ZUbtgU9LaDlo4DHXFGba2ihIgMIicaJcc2kj3G4mHycQ0msipkrHu0SIaIsSeNWo3YMi-A6L1qYIE1bFQYOksjQF1A5E9AyJz1dotUKfJmcrQzMEV3d4BQFdbwC-0Diq2e2eBVTsg_TIhytiuXMGyZsv20pfua7tdC-zMMC-4j' alt='The bodies of people killed during the raid.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Police casualties: Authorities said the operation also killed several security personnel, with some reports listing multiple police officers among the dead and complex scenes of combat in hillside terrain</li><li>Arrests made: Officials reported that the raids resulted in scores of arrests—Time reported about 81 suspects detained during the operation—adding a law-enforcement outcome alongside the killings</li><li>Tactics used: The operation used helicopters, drones and heavy firepower amid reports of drone-dropped explosives and intense firefights in favela hills, according to multiple eyewitness and media accounts</li><li>Public reaction: Residents staged protests and laid bodies in public squares while chanting for resignations, with demonstrators accusing state authorities of excessive force and demanding forensic clarifications</li></ul><blockquote>The public prosecutor’s office must open its own investigations and clarify the circumstances of each death - César Muñoz</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Rio de Janeiro governor (Claudio Castro): The governor posted a video calling the raids a &#x27;historic day in the fight against crime&#x27; and framed the operation as an important blow to organised crime.
