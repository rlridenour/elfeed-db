The <a href="https://news.logitech.com/press-releases/news-details/2025/Introducing-Logitech-Muse-for-Apple-Vision-Pro/default.aspx">Logitech Muse</a> is a spatially-tracked stylus developed for use with the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;. Introduced during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> keynote address, Muse is intended to support the next generation of spatial computing workflows enabled by visionOS 26. The device incorporates six degrees of freedom (6DoF) tracking, pressure-sensitive tips, and real-time haptic feedback to allow users to interact with digital environments through precise input and tactile realism.<br/>
<br/>
According to Logitech, Muse is intended for use across a wide range of spatial computing applications, including 3D design, collaborative workspaces, and immersive visualization tools. During the keynote, the Muse stylus was used to draw freehand in virtual space, annotate objects, and measure dimensions of virtual items. The device features both physical buttons and gesture controls. Muse will be available later in 2025 through both Logitech and Apple.<br/>
