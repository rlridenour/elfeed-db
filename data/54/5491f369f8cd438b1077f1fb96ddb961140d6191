<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VXTqa-ptaA">Quinn Nelson</a> recently did a solid job of breaking down the launch of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-shadows/id6497794841?mt=12"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> on the Mac. If you’re not tracking these things, that’s a big deal: it’s a flagship AAA game that released on the Mac the same day as on other platforms. That kind of same-day launch is rare for the Mac.</p>



<p>So I bought the game. Not because I’m a hardcore <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> fan (though who doesn’t want to sneak around feudal Japan?), but because I was curious. How would it perform on my M2 Max Mac Studio?</p>



<p>The answer: not great.</p>



<p>Actually, worse than not great. The frame rate was inconsistent, often dipping well below 30 frames-per-second when the environment got the least bit complex. There were moments where the game froze entirely. I went through every resolution and graphics setting, from high to medium to low. I even dropped it all the way down to 720p with the lowest possible settings, and it was still unplayable. Perhaps this is because I use a Pro Display XDR? The above screenshot is what my screen looked like often while trying it out.</p>



<p>This is the first time I’ve ever requested a refund on a Mac app.</p>



<p>I want to root for Apple’s gaming ambitions. The company has been talking more about bringing serious titles to the Mac, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-shadows/id6497794841?mt=12"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> looked like a step in the right direction. But if Apple wants to make a credible push into AAA gaming, they’ve still got a lot of work to do, both on the software optimization side and with developer support.</p>
