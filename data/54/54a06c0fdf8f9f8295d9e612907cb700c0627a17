    Due to Emacs, I may have accrued nearly a lifetime by now.

    I've been tweaking and refining my take on the <i>Getting Things Done</i> process,
    and thought I'd share my process.  As a recurring theme on my website, the
    original essay bloomed into three separate chapters:
    </p>

    <ul class="org-ul">
    <li><a href="Technical/Emacs/getting-boxes-done.html">Chapter 1</a> illustrates my workflow with a flowchart</li>
    <li><a href="Technical/Emacs/getting-more-boxes-done.html">Chapter 2</a> describes my Emacs configuration and helper functions</li>
    <li><a href="Technical/Emacs/getting-even-more-boxes-done.html">Chapter 3</a> contains code for turning an Org subtree into its own file</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Would like to hear your opinions for how you keep your tasks and goals organized.
