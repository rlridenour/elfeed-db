<p>I'm an <a href="https://orgmode.org">org mode</a> fan. This blog is powered by org. It's more of an accidental blog that started as a <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/xenodium.github.io/blob/master/index.org">single org file</a> keeping notes. I use <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html">org babel</a> too. Oh and <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html">org habits</a>. My never-ending list of TODOs is also powered by org. I manage all of this from Emacs and peek at TODOs using <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html">org agenda</a>. This all works really well while I'm sitting in front of my laptop running Emacs.</p>
<p>But then I'm away from my laptop… and I need to quickly record habits on the go. I need it to be low-friction. Ssh'ing to an Emacs instance from a smartphone isn't an option. I'm an iPhone user, so whatever the solution, it should play nice with Emacs and org mode. I built <a href="https://flathabits.com">Flat Habits</a> for habit tracking and I'm fairly happy with the result. As of today, my longest-tracked habit is on a 452-day streak.</p>

<p>Moving on to org tasks/TODOs… I want something fairly frictionless while on the go. With <em>Flat Habits</em> as a stepping stone, I can now reuse some parts to build <a href="https://reddit.com/r/plainorg">Plain Org</a>. This new app should give me quick access to my tasks. The two driving goals are: quickly add new tasks and search existing ones while away from my laptop. Ok, maybe basic editing helps too. Oh and it should sync over cloud, of course.</p>

<p>I now have an early implementation of sorts, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/plainorg/comments/p5bnji/ios_more_improvements_alpha_builds_now_on/">available on TestFlight</a>.
