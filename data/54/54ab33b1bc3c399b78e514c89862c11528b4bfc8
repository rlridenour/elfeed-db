ColorWare today introduced a clever new range of <a href="https://www.colorware.com/collections/colorware-apple-crayon-pros">custom Apple Pencils</a> that have been designed to look like crayons. ColorWare is known for its custom-painted Apple accessories and products like AirPods, and the company sometimes does unique limited edition designs.<br/>

The ColorWare Apple Crayon Pro is available in seven colors, including black, mint, pink, purple, red, white, and yellow. Each one has a custom colored tip and a matching wrapper, all of which is painted on a standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro. ColorWare previously did a custom &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; designed to look like a <a href="https://www.colorware.com/products/colorware-apple-number-2-pencil-pro">number 2 pencil</a>, but the custom crayons in multiple colors are even more fun. With the attention to design, the Apple Crayon Pro does indeed look quite a bit like an actual crayon.<br/>

ColorWare has been customizing Apple devices for more than a decade, and it has perfected the process for a lasting finish. ColorWare uses a multi-step coating system, including a primer, a proprietary color formula, and a liquid plastic coating to protect the color. All products are warrantied for 12 months.<br/>

Because ColorWare is using a standard &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro, all of the functionality of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; remains intact. The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro works with the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, and the A17 Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>.<br/>
