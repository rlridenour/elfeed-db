<p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private food aid distributor backed by the United States and Israel, has announced it is permanently ending operations in the Gaza Strip after months of criticism and a suspension following the October 10 ceasefire. The group operated four main distribution hubs, mostly in southern Gaza, and said it delivered millions of meals during the war, but those sites also became scenes of deadly chaos where hundreds of Palestinians were killed as crowds tried to reach aid, with Israel’s military acknowledging it fired on people approaching soldiers near some locations. GHF bypassed the United Nations and long-established humanitarian agencies, a structure that angered some European leaders and led Austria’s foreign minister to publicly say the organization was not a reliable partner. Executive director John Acree said a US-led multinational coordination center in Israel overseeing President Trump’s plan to end the conflict would now take over and expand the aid model GHF piloted, and the foundation framed its closure as having completed an &quot;emergency mission&quot; even though it still had funds to operate longer.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/QQQ1WurmYZJRee7cUtTmh_DWc1oLLmf-Gkra6npEtWn6ZsWf8H4x9Vfzn3hgNf7EfR-EdSjrjxfWsMqsfgFp-6TdJVdf6UlS4r6nq3vW2-tD3F4ndUiwVwBAQYBmRQG7rMdq5LKluZHeMwtKHImiVPmmhg-uaxVSLbD3sxrLPqZzbYucqDNoLxKsiTK6ccLe0YbDzy8P5Yo0MSJpfWaDRdD_dTMZJRAvstk' alt='People carry bags of food from a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation distribution center in central Gaza during its operations in August 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Operational model: GHF was structured as a private company that distributed food directly to Palestinians under a US- and Israel-designed system intended as an alternative channel to traditional UN-led aid convoys.</li><li>Site locations: Most of GHF’s distribution hubs were established in southern Gaza rather than near the more densely populated central and northern areas, requiring many Palestinians to walk long distances in search of food during the blockade period.</li><li>Funding sources: The Trump administration provided tens of millions of dollars to finance GHF activities, but the organization repeatedly declined to identify other donors even after questions from journalists and officials.</li><li>European concerns: European officials were angered that GHF’s creation sidelined established multilateral aid systems, with critics warning that setting up a parallel structure undermined coordination and safety protocols developed over years of work in Gaza.</li><li>Post-GHF plans: Acree said the US-led multinational coordination center in Israel will now &quot;adopt and expand&quot; GHF’s approach, suggesting that future food distribution could rely more on militarily coordinated hubs rather than solely on UN agencies.</li></ul><blockquote>We are winding down our operations as we have succeeded in our mission of showing there’s a better way to deliver aid to Gaza - John Acree</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Gaza Humanitarian Foundation leadership: Executive director John Acree described GHF’s work as a successful pilot and said the group is closing because a US-led coordination center will now take over and expand the aid model it developed.
