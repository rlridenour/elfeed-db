<p>Texas Tech University System Chancellor Brandon Creighton, in a memo yesterday to the presidents of the universities in the system, announced a policy to &#8220;ensure that classroom instruction fully complies with state and federal law, Board of Regents policy, and Chancellor directives.&#8221; The memo includes a remarkable flowchart.<span id="more-55842"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/texas-tech-25-12-1-memorandum-chancellor.pdf">Here&#8217;s the memo</a>.</p>
<p>Among other things, it includes passages on sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>Two Sexes Recognized Under the Law and in Course Content</strong></em><br />
<em>State law and federal policy dictate only two sexes, male and female, are recognized. Faculty are expected to comply with these standards when instructing students in their professional capacity, which includes submitting course content related to gender identity through the course content review process overseen by the Board of Regents.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>Review of Sexual Orientation Content Required</strong></em><br />
<em>Faculty are required to submit course content related to sexual orientation through the Course Content Review Process overseen by the board of regents.</em></p>
<p>Any professors who plan on teaching about sexual categories, gender identity, and sexual orientation are instructed work through the following bureaucratic nightmare of inefficiency and micromanagement:</p>

<p>By the way, the phrase &#8220;academic freedom&#8221; does not appear in Creighton&#8217;s memo.</p>
<p>The flowchart seems to suggest that issues related to gender identity and sexual orientation will almost never be taught outside courses aiming to prepare students for &#8220;professional licensure / client care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at the first question, which asks about whether course materials are &#8220;relevant <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>and</strong></em></span> necessary.&#8221; (I take &#8220;course material&#8221; to include readings and other media, as well as lecture notes, class discussion prompts, etc.)</p>
<p>Consider a typical philosophy course on &#8220;contemporary moral problems.&#8221; Various issues related to gender identity and sexual orientation are routinely on the syllabi of such courses. They are certainly &#8220;relevant&#8221; to the course. But are they &#8220;necessary&#8221;? Of course not. There are countless issues one could cover in a contemporary moral problems course and countless combinations of such topics that would make for a good course. All of those combinations will fail to cover most relevant issues&#8212;there&#8217;s only so much that can be taught in one course&#8212;and sometimes what they will fail to cover will be gender identity or sexual orientation. Since one could teach a perfectly good contemporary moral problems course without teaching about gender identity or sexual orientation (and yes, one could), those topics are not &#8220;necessary.&#8221;  If they&#8217;re not necessary, the flowchart says: &#8220;remove from course content.&#8221;</p>
<p>What can be said about courses on contemporary moral problems can be said about many courses across the humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p>What about courses that are specifically about gender identity or sexual orientation? Wouldn&#8217;t material on the topics then be necessary? Perhaps, but are such courses necessary, in the eyes of the Texas legislature or the Chancellor? In the memo, Creighton notes that the course content review process is the &#8220;first step&#8221; the Board of Regents is taking to implement &#8220;its statutory responsibility&#8221; under <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB37/2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas Senate Bill 37</a>. The aim, he says, is to &#8220;ensure each university is offering degrees of value,&#8221; and it would not be surprising if his &#8220;ongoing&#8221; curriculum review resulted in attempting to eliminate such courses.</p>
