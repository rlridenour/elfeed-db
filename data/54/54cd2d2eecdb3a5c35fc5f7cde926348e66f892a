<p>
Sewing together with A+ is helping me learn so
much about making and re-making, and about saying
yes.
</p>

<p>
I'm not good at saying yes. Sometimes it's because
I have no idea how to make something happen, and I
don't want to overcommit. Sometimes it's because I
don't think something will be practical or
worthwhile. Sometimes it's because I want to spend
the time or money on other things instead.
Sometimes I don't know how to make it something
that she can help with. But A+ asks with shining
eyes, and I'm learning, slowly, slowly, to say
yes. I'm beginning to trust that the mistakes
don't matter as much as the memories do.

<p>
A+ has always had ideas about what she wants to
wear. At five, she was all about floor-length
dresses. I sewed her A-line dresses in comfortable
cotton Lycra, peasant-style dresses that matched
my tops. I also made a knee-length swim skirt for
her. She liked it and requested a floor-length
version so that she could twirl and twirl and
twirl at the splash pad. She wore it into the
wading pool too, enjoying how it swirled around
her, trapping air under the skirt and marvelling
as it ballooned. The following year, she asked me
to attach a bodice to it to make it a dress. I
turned the knee-length skirt into the bodice for
the floor-length dress, took out the stitches that
had previously narrowed the then-too-large waist,
and it was good for another year of twirling.
</p>

<p>
When she was 6 and in the throes of a Cinderella
obsession (we read through 50+ variants of the
story from the library), I made her a powder blue
charmeuse ballgown with a full-circle skirt
supported by the petticoats and tutus that she
layered with abandon: 19 layers of tulle in total.
She loved curtsying and twirling with that whole
shebang at the pretend tea parties she hosted at
the playground, and it survived the washing
machine surprisingly well.
</p>

<p>
A+ is nine now and has long outgrown the ballgown,
which has been stashed in the closet until I
figure out if it's going to become a skirt for her
or for me. But she still wears the A-line dresses
from years ago, which now reach her knees instead
of her ankles. She still likes fanciful clothes. I
made a floor-length light blue dress so that she
could wear it to her cousin's wedding. She picked
out some ribbon for the waist, a lace trim to
place near the hem, and some ribbon flowers as
embellishments, and she asked me to sew a hooded
cloak with a ribbon closure. After the wedding, I
trimmed the dress to knee-length and re-sewed the
lace close to the new hem so that she could wear
it while biking to the playground.
</p>

<p>
Inevitably, she's beginning to grow up. Her fancy
is tempered by a few nods to practicality:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>knee-length skirts because they don't get in the way of riding her bike</li>
<li>she likes stretchy fabric more than woven fabric</li>
<li>skorts are great for doing cartwheels or hanging upside down.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We prefer to buy fabric in person so that she can
feel the fabric on her skin. At the store, A+
zeroed in on a sheer floral print organza that she
had seen on a mannequin in the window display.
"The organza doesn't have a border," she said. "We
can make it a circle skort." She's learning to
think about the characteristics of the fabric and
what we can do with it. She matched the sheer
floral organza fabric with a peach
polyester-spandex from the swimwear section and
the right colour of thread from the basement.
</p>

<p>
This will be the fourth warm-weather skirt this
year. We make little tweaks each time, as she
learns more about what she likes to wear. Here's
the progression so far:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For her first summer skirt this year, I made a
lavender knee-length rectangle skirt with
scallop-edged embroidered mesh over bridal
satin, gathered at a 1:2 ratio. She liked the
dressiness of it, but 1:2 turned out to not be
enough ease for cartwheels, so she changes into
something else when she wants to be more active.</li>
<li>The second was a mermaid scale skort made from
the swimwear fabric I ordered last year, based
on one of the purchased skorts she liked. It'll
be her new swim skirt.</li>
<li>The third one was a purple skort. I changed it
from side seams to a single back seam so that
it's easier for A+ to tell the difference
between front and back.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I love being able to change things based on her
feedback. We've browsed nearby clothing stores and
bought a few pieces, but she rarely finds things
that she really likes. Her last pick from the
store was a peach skort with a matching top. I
removed the waist elastic from the top because she
doesn't like elastics, and now it's good to go.
It'll be the model for the new skort, I think: a
non-stretchy skirt with a stretchy fabric used for
the shorts. This time she wants a knee-length
circle skirt instead of the mid-thigh length of
the commercial skorts. Easy enough - just a matter of
drawing a bigger circle.

</figure>

</div>

<p>
I appreciate how all this experience re-making
things makes it easier to say yes to A+'s ideas.
For example, the hat I sewed for her last year is
starting to feel a bit small. I cut pieces for a
new bucket hat using the free <a href="https://www.applegreencottage.com/tutorial-cute-bucket-hat/">AppleGreen Cottage
pattern</a> that I'd previously used to make two other
hats for her and one for me. This time, I wanted
to make the outer layer from the floral canvas
left over from reupholstering long-gone dining
room chairs and the inner layer from the linen tea
toweling that we decided not to use in the
kitchen. Midway through the process, A+ asked me
if I could make the hat pointy instead, like a
witch's hat. I put the brim pieces together,
sketched out a quick quarter-circle, sewed the
outer layer, and tested the fit on her head. Then
I used the inner brim layer to cover up the seams,
finished with some topstitching, and it was good
to go. I figured that if she changed her mind and
wanted a flat hat, I could easily make one from
the scraps, or I could even modify this pointy hat
to put a different crown on it.

<p>
Sewing is becoming more enjoyable and less
stressful. I worry less about making mistakes
because I've learned how to recover from many of
them. Sometimes something's more of a loss, like
that lavender floor-length cotton dress with a
split organza overskirt that she wore a couple of
times before it was declared too uncomfortable, or
the scraps that she cuts up when trying to fashion
a dress for her doll. That's fine, fabric is
tuition for learning.
</p>

<p>
A+'s becoming more adept, too. She's no longer
limited to standing still for measurements,
fetching pieces of fabric, or other make-work I
could think of to keep her busy while I sewed. Now
she can get the sewing machine to wind the bobbin
and she can thread the needle. She can sew
straight seams and stop when the machine makes an
unexpected sound. She can turn straps right side
out and unpick seams when we make mistakes or
change our minds. She knows it isn't just a matter
of how a fabric looks, but also what it feels like
and how it moves. She's gradually learning what
she likes and what she doesn't like. And if I have
the temerity to remind her how to do something
("Make a 'p' shape with the thread when you put it
in the bobbin case"), I get a glimpse of the
teenager she'll become ("I know how to do it,
Mom.").
</p>

<p>
We're getting better at seeing the clothes as
their component parts: patterns, fabric, pieces we
can recombine. "Can you copy this, but without
sleeves?" she asks, and I figure it out. Looking
at the yardage left, I can start to think: ah, I
can squeeze a matching training bra out of this
part, and I think I have enough here to make a
top, and this rectangle is large enough for a
headband, and I can turn these scraps into flowers
while I'm waiting for her at a playdate.
</p>

<p>
I'm learning from all her requests. By myself, I
tend to settle into comfortable routines. In 2015,
<a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2015/05/quantified-self-the-numbers-on-sewing/">I made 18 tops</a> based on the <a href="https://www.seamwork.com/pdf-sewing-patterns/sorbetto-easy-woven-tank-top?cv=2">Colette Sorbetto woven
tank top pattern</a>, eventually taking advantage of
<a href="https://hacklab.to/">Hacklab</a>'s laser cutter to <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2015/04/laser-cutting-update-marvel-version/">precisely cut the fabric</a>
so that my notches lined up every time. When I
find something I like, I make it again and again.
A+'s still figuring out what she likes. We're
learning so much.
</p>

<p>
Sewing for A+ is a time-limited opportunity, and I
want to make the most of it. There are only so
many clothes I can sew for her. Eventually she may
want to wear the same things as everyone else, or
eventually she might be comfortable doing all the
sewing herself. Eventually she'll be off on her
own life. Maybe the ballgowns will turn into
skirts or camisoles, and from there into headbands
or scrunchies.

<p>
Re-making echoes through our past. My mom tells me
this story of how her mom sewed, and how their
family was poor. My mom rarely got a new dress, so
when her mom sewed a red dress for her, that was
special. She wore it until the bodice couldn't fit
any more. Her mom undid the seams, sewed a new
bodice onto the skirt, and gave the dress back to
her. She wore it until the skirt was all worn out.
Her mom undid the seams and replaced the skirt. My
mom said to her mom, "Does this mean I have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">new
dress</a> now?" This was not the only dress my
grandmother made for her. My mom also tells a
story of how one time she hovered by her mom's
sewing machine, impatiently waiting for her mom to
finish sewing the dress that she was going to wear
to a party that day. My grandmother must have also
worked on re-making, on learning how to say yes.
My mom didn't make clothes for me, but she passed
on the stories.
</p>

<p>
All this reminds me a little of two picture books
we borrowed from the library. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6219325-my-forever-dress">My Forever Dress</a> by
Harriet Ziefurt and Liz Murphy (2009, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YezKVKVgho">video</a>) shows
how a grandmother extended and transformed a dress
as her granddaughter grew. <a href="https://schol.ca/our-books/book/something-from-nothing-9781443119467">Something from Nothing</a>
by Phoebe Gilman (1992, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVIcmOVuFsI">video</a>) retells the Yiddish
folktale about <a href="http://www.newtunings.com/kidmid/overcoat.html">Joseph's overcoat</a>, this time with a
special blanket that gets worn down and
transformed into a jacket, a vest, a tie, a
handkerchief, ending as a fabric-covered button.
The button gets lost, but it turns into a story.
Of the two, I liked <i>Something from Nothing</i> more.
I liked the lighter touch it told the story with,
and I liked the reminder that cherished things can
be turned into stories.

<p>
A+ was in the kitchen, making a grocery list on an
LCD writing tablet. She wanted to buy apple sauce,
yogurt cups, and mac and cheese. She wanted to do
it herself, with her own money. W- will walk her
to the store, let her loose, and meet up with her
in front of one of the aisles. "Mama, you can stay
home," she said.
</p>

<p>
Challenge: She wanted her own bag for groceries.
Her backpack was too small. I rummaged through the
reusable bags hanging on the coat hooks. There's
this cotton tote we got from an event, but the
straps are too long. When she put it on her
shoulder, it threatened to fall down. When she
carried the bag by its straps, the bag dragged on
the floor. I shortened one strap to see if she can
hold it then. The body of the bag itself was too
long. I sewed a seam across the bottom. Now it's
the right height for her. I shortened the other
strap and serged the bottom seam to make it neat.
She wanted a pocket for her purse and the KN95
mask that she'll wear in the supermarket. W- was
almost ready to head out. "Give me another five
minutes and I can make her a pocketed bag," I
said. He waited. I opened up the scrap from the
bottom, sewed the edges together in the other
direction, turned it into a pocket, and sewed it
to the top hem of the bag. A+ pronounced it
perfect. She tucked her purse, mask, and shopping
list into the bag, looped the straps over her
shoulder, snugged the bag under her elbow, and
headed out into the world.

<p>
I still sweat my way through figuring out how to
sew what she comes up with, but it's good for me.
I make and re-make so she can have things that fit
her ideas, and so that she can dream of more.
She's learning that her ideas matter. It can take
several tries, but we can make them happen
together. Someday she'll make and re-make things
all on her own.
