<p>I jumped into the deep water, making Zen my default browser on my work Mac. On my Linux box, I&rsquo;ve been using Zen for a couple of days. So far, I feel like Zen is fixing a problem I don&rsquo;t have - or don&rsquo;t have anymore.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used Arc Browser before, so I&rsquo;m familiar with the concept of a single browser having different containers. My case is the classic one: one for work, one for personal stuff (maybe one for shopping down the road). The way the tabs are configured is a nice touch: it&rsquo;s good to have &ldquo;essential&rdquo; tabs I use all the time, and nested tabs (or tab folders?) could be helpful at work when I have several tickets open in ServiceNow.</p>
<p>However, my current arrangement is pretty solid already.</p>
<p>On my Mac, I have Edge installed. This is my work browser, as pretty much mandated (I can use whatever I want, but officially, Edge is the supported browser), and as such, it&rsquo;s synced to my work profile along with Office365. Meanwhile, on the personal side, I&rsquo;ve been using Orion, which is built on top of Safari. It looks and feels very different from Edge, which further helps distinguish the two workflows.</p>
<p>I usually work with two Spaces on my Mac: the left one for personal stuff, the right one for work. It&rsquo;s easy to switch between my work and personal environment.</p>
<p>On Linux, the <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/11/29/kde-and-kubuntu-more-googies.html">separation is even better</a> with <a href="https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/plasma-desktop/plasma-desktop/activities-interface.html">Activities</a>. Not only can I switch &ldquo;spaces&rdquo; or virtual desktop, I can also have a completely different environment, complete with it&rsquo;s on applications, shortcuts and wallpaper (<a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/12/01/heres-a-visual-of-why.html">here is an example</a> where I use two different instances of Emacs: one for work, one for personal; the theme even looks different). So not only do I switch to Edge on Linux when I need to work, but I also switch to a different Emacs instance and a work-related wallpaper.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m pretty good already.</p>
<p>There are a few &ldquo;glitches&rdquo; in my current setup though that maybe would make more sense if I only use Zen on the Mac. For example, if I open a link from my Teams or Outlook app, it will open in Orion, my personal browser. I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/velja/id1607635845?mt=12">Velja</a> to resolve this. In short, Velja is a browser &ldquo;chooser&rdquo; based on a few conditions such as the URL I&rsquo;m opening or what App I am using. It doesn&rsquo;t work smoothly though, especially with Microsoft Teams and Outlook, which seem to somehow bypass it even though it&rsquo;s marked as the default browser.</p>
<p>Orion itself has a few issues. Some sites won&rsquo;t open, or will get &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; loading. This is usually because of enhanced privacy settings and blockers, but sometimes I have to quit the browser and relaunch it to get it to work, even if I turn those off for the site. It doesn&rsquo;t happen often enough to be really annoying, but it&rsquo;s a reminder that Orion still has a few wrinkles that need to be worked on.</p>
<p>Zen and its workflow can offer a few interesting things. Having my &ldquo;every day&rdquo; browser on Linux could be nice, and I could even let it through the VPN so I have no issues at all with it, making my Linux desktop even better in terms of work (it&rsquo;s getting to the point that it&rsquo;s just more convenient to work with Linux over macOS) - but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m comfortable for this lack of separation.</p>
<p>Well, OK then. Let&rsquo;s give it a few days and see what happens.</p>
