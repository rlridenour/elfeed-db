When an iPad running iPadOS 19 is connected to a Magic Keyboard, a macOS-like menu bar will appear on the screen, <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/ipados-19-and-ios-19-new-features/">according to the leaker Majin Bu</a>.<br/>

This change would further blur the lines between the iPad and the Mac. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/ipados-19-more-like-macos/">iPadOS 19 will be "more like macOS,"</a> with unspecified improvements to productivity, multitasking, and app window management, and the addition of a macOS-like menu bar would certainly align with that overall plan.<br/>
<br/>
In a blog post today, the leaker also claimed that iPadOS 19 will enhance Stage Manager, the feature that lets you use multiple apps at once on an external display. The leaker said that Stage Manager will work more seamlessly, but they did not provide any specific details about the alleged improvements. They also said that iOS 19 will enable at least a basic version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ios-19-iphone-stage-manager-rumor/">Stage Manager on iPhone models with a USB-C port</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The first beta of iPadOS 19 should be available after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/">WWDC 2025 keynote on June 9</a>, but some new features are not enabled until later betas.<br/>
