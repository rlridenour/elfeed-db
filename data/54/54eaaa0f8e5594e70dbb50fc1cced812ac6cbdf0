<p>U.S. and Canadian officials held a joint news conference in Washington, D.C., announcing new arrests, indictments and sanctions tied to an alleged transnational drug network led by former Canadian snowboarder Ryan Wedding, and unsealed charges that include murder and large-scale drug trafficking. Authorities said they increased the reward for information leading to Wedding’s arrest to $15 million and unveiled fresh indictments against several of his alleged associates, calling the case part of a long-running cross-border investigation. Prosecutors accuse Wedding of ordering the killing of a witness who was due to testify, and the unsealed charging papers detail the scope of the alleged trafficking operation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/VbrPpcilh0-4Q8Vsy_LcHHRQE1GzdgWTBPSsv_MVaKBI0plvl6O5pVWE1FqSDn7lGt5skpim_9qO8UoFzHobOAglM17xjV4sO4qTaxPl4XGhxGz2CICQy3xSvjgP6gIy58ZRAbTMNv1fe19cs-APrXtPWDBIW-_C8CBoHBZI0U1jBKAQQEZteQrShowEVj1l_hHts4u0m1x1M0Opjq62bWI9dGq0wk4T2a_JgORbiqDS29Ixzke1564O-a_P9HDDNBrIZrUE3gxD-jgrXg' alt='Attorney General Pam Bondi stands near wanted poster for Canadian fugitive Ryan Wedding during a Department of Justice news conference in Washington.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Murder allegation: The unsealed indictment alleges Wedding tracked down a witness in Colombia who was later murdered before he could testify, a central count in the new U.S. case.</li><li>Canadian arrests: Canadian authorities arrested several people in connection with the investigation — prosecutors and police in both countries said arrests and indictments targeted Wedding’s alleged domestic network.</li><li>FBI characterization: FBI director Kash Patel and other U.S. officials described the accused as a major cocaine trafficker and likened aspects of the case to prior large-scale cartel investigations.</li><li>Athletic past: Before the allegations, Wedding represented Canada in Olympic snowboarding competition, including appearances at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, a detail highlighted as investigators tracked his post-athletic activities.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. Department of Justice (Attorney General Pam Bondi): U.S. officials announced new arrests, unsealed an indictment and increased the reward for information leading to Wedding’s arrest as part of an effort to dismantle the alleged transnational network.
