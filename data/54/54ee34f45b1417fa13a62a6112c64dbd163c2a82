God of Grace, God of Mercy, We pray today for the people <br></br>
of the Tree of Life congregation <br></br>
in Pittsburgh. We pray for all those <br></br>
who suffer from violence, <br></br>
for those who grieve, <br></br>
and for those who have died <br></br>
because of a hatred that <br></br>
has no point, <br></br>
and makes no sense. May they find comfort in <br></br>
the knowledge of your love, <br></br>
and healing in the support <br></br>
of the community. We ask forgiveness <br></br>
for the ways in which <br></br>
your word has been twisted <br></br>
to support acts of evil. Give us the courage <br></br>
to challenge the evil rhetoric <br></br>
that supports hatred and violence, <br></br>
and to speak the truth boldly, <br></br>
that your love, grace, and mercy <br></br>
extend to all without limit. May the love of your people do the same.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
