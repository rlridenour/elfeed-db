With zero prep and a crowd full of curveballs, Dave, Pete, and Adam tackled real-time questions and Quick Tips on the fly. You’ll hear how to enable iPhone Mirroring for Mac notifications, rescue iMessages, and stabilize that wandering Dock. From Drobo debates and Apple Maps silence to VPNs with Tailscale and quirky Apple TV issues—this is geek troubleshooting in its rawest form.</p>
<p class="p1">Desktop icons shifting, login cert errors, Siri forgetting your name—nothing was off-limits. The crowd kept the trio on their toes with Mac mysteries and clever hacks, like Doc Rock’s red/green card video editing trick. You’ll even find out what wine your favorite geeks prefer. Whether it’s legacy Macs, lost phonetics, or wild goose chases through Apple’s system status, this one’s packed with fast answers and deep dives. Don’t Get Caught unprepared—this episode is live, unscripted, and all in.</p>
