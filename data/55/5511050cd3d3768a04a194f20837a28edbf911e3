<p>David Lynch loved his coffee. For decades, the filmmaker let coffee <a href="https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/david-lynch-on-ideas-routine-sugar">fuel his creativity</a>, drinking five, six, even seven cups per day at <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2018/08/how-david-lynch-got-creative-inspiration.html">Bob’s Big Boy.</a> Famously, Lynch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvs7pmISe8I">celebrated coffee in</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvs7pmISe8I"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a> (remember the line, “That’s a damn fine cup of coffee!”), and later directed a whole mini-season of <em>Twin Peaks</em> in <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2015/11/david-lynch-directs-a-mini-season-of-twin-peaks-in-the-form-of-japanese-coffee-commercials.html">the form of Japanese coffee commercials</a>. Then, in 2006, the director launched his own line of organic coffee, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/david-lynch-coffee-makes-foods-608250/">sold at Whole Foods.</a></p>
<p>When the filmmaker died this past January, he left behind no shortage of coffee paraphernalia—ranging from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaYnxJQYef4">high-end La Marzocco espresso machine</a> to some run-of-the-mill devices. Take, for example, a fairly ordinary <a href="https://www.juliensauctions.com/en/items/1426245/david-lynch-mr-coffee-coffee-makers">“Mr. Coffee” coffee maker that sold at auction for $4,550</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.juliensauctions.com/en/items/1426289/david-lynch-circa-early-1970s-electric-espresso-maker">1970s electric espresso maker</a> made of metal and orange plastic. Above, the coffee connoisseur James Hoffmann takes the orange machine for a test drive. (He paid nearly $2,000 for it, after all.) As for the verdict — no spoilers here. You’ll have to see for yourself.</p>
