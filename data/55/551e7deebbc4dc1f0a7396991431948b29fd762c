Anchoring my thoughts with a sketch
</p>

<p>
I keep most of my notes in text files. This is great for searching, but the sameness of the typography makes things blur together.
</p>

<p>
I have to read a lot to remember what things felt like, and I still feel so much is missing. Some people can evoke lush word-pictures. I'm not there yet.
</p>

<p>
Lately I've been giving myself more time to draw, to <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/08/colours/">colour</a>, to doodle.
</p>

<p>
"Today: A+ kept giving me hugs as we walked home from the supermarket."
</p>

<p>
Even my simple sketches give me a surprisingly good sense of what I felt, what I cared about.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2020/06/pythonfontforgeorg-i-made-a-font-based-on-my-handwriting/">I made a font from my handwriting</a>, but real handwritten text says so much more.
</p>

<p>
Comics are very expressive. I wonder how they do that.
How do they draw something so specific and yet so resonant?
</p>

<p>
I take a tangled thought, coax a bit of it into a drawing, and see where that takes me.
</p>

<p>
"A drawing is simply a line going for a walk." - Paul Klee
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I do an audio braindump to feel my way around it or to capture lots of details. That gives me a wall of text. Too much, and at the same time, not enough.
</p>

<p>
I might try to make an outline and expand it, but I often lose steam.
</p>

<p>
I like organizing and fleshing out the sketch. Drawing it is fun.
</p>

<p>
Then I can write the text. I often add lots of details and links. Sometimes I feel lost in the weeds. The sketch becomes my map.
</p>

<p>
I want to finish writing so that you can see my sketch!
(and so it makes sense to you and my future self)
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I just keep playing with the drawing until something interesting emerges.
</p>

<p>
I've been drawing more lately. It's slow, but more
fun. I like looking at my sketches from years ago.
I think I will like these ones years from now.
</p>

<p>
I feel like drawings do a good job of reminding me
what I feel about a topic, why I want to write
about it, and what the overall shape of the topic
is, which is important so that I don't run out of
steam a couple thousand words into a post.
The drawing also encourages me to finish the
post so that I can put it out there.

I find when I look back over these notes that the memories really come flooding back in really high detail because then, I spent a little more time documenting when I [relive it].
