<p>A test train in China’s southwestern Yunnan province struck a group of railway maintenance workers at Luoyangzhen Station in Kunming early on Thursday, leaving 11 dead and two injured, according to railway authorities and state media. The train, identified as No. 55537 and used for seismic equipment testing, collided with workers who were entering the track on a curve, where visibility is typically more limited than on straight sections. Local railway and government departments activated emergency response measures immediately after the collision, and the injured were taken for medical treatment. Authorities have restored normal operations at the station and opened a formal investigation to determine how the workers and the test train came to be on the same section of track at the same time.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8gMU-QrOqfPkls1xRedzIKvh8LDCvtiZiwfNsqhiJIhapGuWqSCr_8hVPIfNLhEiE32EFYOJOyex7BN9sviSGqsWhuPnESOhOjXNPowora1REbzRA3rIwUa2PUIKOy1rF-IzYnpYiiL6Bw_xUGPsGtaL_91BscZYAQt7u206rM9GuCCb8RZYoQMSbs3KcVORLBRoaNmRoWDbx9qkgZTFGcY6QaqP6Yi54vv4sBdzuFS7Cntdkx1A50aVKJOiYKa3' alt='A train passes through a railway station in China’s Yunnan province, where a separate test train accident killed maintenance workers.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Train’s special role: The train involved, numbered 55537, was assigned to test seismic monitoring equipment on the railway line rather than carrying passengers.</li><li>Location specifics: The crash occurred at Luoyang Town (Luoyangzhen) station on the outskirts of Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan province in southwest China.</li><li>Crew activity: The maintenance personnel were construction workers entering the rail line for planned work when the collision happened on a curved section of track, according to the Kunming Railway Bureau.</li><li>Operational status: Railway authorities reported that the affected station resumed regular train services after emergency operations and on-site handling were completed.</li><li>Official inquiry: The railway operator and local government have launched a formal safety investigation to establish the causes of the accident and assess responsibility.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Kunming Railway Bureau: The Kunming Railway Bureau said the train, which was &quot;used for seismic equipment testing,&quot; collided with construction workers at Luoyang Town station in the early morning, resulting in multiple casualties and prompting an investigation into the circumstances of the crash.
