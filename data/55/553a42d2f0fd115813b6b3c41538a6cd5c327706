<p>In November 1943, as they planned a summit meeting, FDR wired Churchill to suggest that Cairo might be too dangerous a location. Churchill <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1943CairoTehran/d154">responded</a>:</p>
<p>SEE ST. JOHN, CHAPTER 14, VERSES 1 TO 4.</p>
<p>These verses read:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.</li>
<li>In my Father&#8217;s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you.</li>
<li>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</li>
<li>And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</li>
</ol>
<p>They met in Cairo.</p>
