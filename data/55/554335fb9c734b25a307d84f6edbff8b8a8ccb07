Apple today shared a new "Outrun" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> ad on its YouTube channel, highlighting the usefulness of the payments service when a physical payment method is unavailable. <br/>

In the spot, a woman fleeing from an attacking monster pulls into a gas station, then realizes she doesn't have her wallet to pay for gas. She's able to make her purchase with her <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> instead. "Count on &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;," reads the video's tagline. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has been running the 35-second ad on TikTok and other social networks since November, but it is new to YouTube as of today. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; works on all modern iPhones and Apple Watch models, allowing users to link a debit or credit card to a device and use the Wallet app to make contactless payments in supported locations. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/apple-ad-outrun-apple-pay/">Apple&#039;s &#039;Outrun&#039; Ad Features Apple Pay Saving the Day in Monster Attack</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-outrun-ad-features-apple-pay-saving-the-day-in-monster-attack.2474375/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
