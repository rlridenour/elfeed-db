<p>Paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) are accused of killing thousands of civilians and committing mass atrocities in el-Fasher, a city in Sudan&#x27;s Darfur region, as fighting intensifies and humanitarian needs grow. Survivors and rights groups report ethnic-targeted attacks and large-scale abuses; medics say bodies have been burned or buried to hide evidence, allegations the RSF denies.
