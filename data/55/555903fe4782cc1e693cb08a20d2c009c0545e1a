<p>Last year <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/06/how-sandwich-streamed-the-talk-show-live-in-3d-on-vision-pro/">Sandwich streamed The Talk Show from WWDC</a> in its Theater app for Vision Pro. This year, it did so again, but also recorded three different angles of the show and assembled them together to <a href="https://sandwich.vision/press/TTS-Live-2025/">create an interactive view</a> from within the Theater app:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  You’re not just watching the show, you’re attending it. Sit in the front row with other fans and direct your own experience by switching between cameras in real-time, getting up close to the conversation on the stage… VR filmmakers have always struggled with where to put the cut. We give that agency to the viewer, and the effect is unexpectedly magical.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I was sitting in the front row of the theater off to the far left, right behind Sandwich’s capture camera, and Theater remarkably replicates that experience. When you swipe to move between cameras, you also move locations in Theater’s immersive venue, maintaining geographical sense and the illusion of watching John Gruber and his guests on stage. It’s not <em>immersive video</em> in the way Apple has defined it, but it’s 3-D video playing on a stage inside an immersive environment, so it’s pretty close!</p>
<p>According to Sandwich, “the production uses a combination of stereoscopic 6K cameras and iPhones with AI 3D conversion.” There are more details on how it was all put together in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6SbkEC1Xb8&amp;t=1024s">a video by Adam Savage and Tested</a>.</p>
