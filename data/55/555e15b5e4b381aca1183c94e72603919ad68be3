<p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado visited the White House this week and presented President Trump with the physical medal from her 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, describing the gesture as recognition of his role in Venezuela’s push for freedom. The Norwegian Nobel Committee then emphasized that while a medal can change hands, the Nobel Peace Prize itself is not transferable and remains permanently tied to the original laureate recorded in Nobel history. The handover drew mixed reactions, including criticism from some Norwegian figures, while also putting a spotlight on a bigger question: what international recognition means during Venezuela’s uncertain political transition.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fkEjf-NEkAaxh36xZalhUxEzy0dlYQX4dePvZnNQlsdXsKSWopRp85UJMw3YHstuJL7mI5RniItUQ4vc0PbYnXJMKvR3Q_5QSvUz4X2RQJ4tnSe-FO5U7_ByJOrrCtz0ppNagUmnOLwl4y4txq2xzUxNBYfnBiJs5CQ9z5tLwteND24BWpKPKCPX7boUuOO24nY' alt='María Corina Machado’s decision to present her Nobel Peace Prize medal to President Trump has been met with mixed reviews in the United States and abroad.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Nobel clarification: The Nobel Committee said that even if the medal, diploma, or prize money changes possession, the official Nobel record still names the original laureate as the recipient.</li><li>Past precedents: Several Nobel medals have been donated or sold over time, and some have fetched millions at auction, underscoring that the object can be traded even though the honor cannot.</li><li>Venezuela outlook: After the meeting, Machado publicly voiced confidence in an eventual democratic transition and described Venezuela as a future close partner of the United States following an “orderly transition”.</li><li>Policy tension: Reporting noted a contrast between Machado’s emphasis on free elections and President Trump’s public focus on Venezuela’s oil, alongside the U.S. decision to back an interim governing arrangement led by Delcy Rodríguez.</li><li>Mixed reception: The medal gift prompted backlash from some observers in Norway and debate about the symbolism and soft-power value of the Peace Prize.</li></ul><blockquote>Venezuela is going to be free - María Corina Machado</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>María Corina Machado: She framed giving the medal to President Trump as a symbolic recognition tied to Venezuela’s freedom movement and argued that Venezuela can become a strong U.S. ally after an orderly democratic transition.
