<blockquote>
  <p>Reached for comment, Apple confirmed the apps’ removal, saying it
removed Tea Dating Advice and TeaOnHer from the App Store because
they failed to meet Apple’s requirements around content moderation
and user privacy. The company also said it saw an excessive number
of user complaints and negative reviews, which included complaints
of minors’ personal information being posted in these apps. Apple
communicated the issues to the developers of the apps, a
representative said, but the complaints were not addressed.
(Request for comment from the app developers has not yet been
returned.)</p>

<p>Specifically, Apple cited violations of its App Review Guidelines
1.2, 5.1.2, and 5.6. <a href="https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/_e1_Cyp4m4hLQEx2TZf6uxDIKv?domain=developer.apple.com">Rule 1.2</a> says apps with user-generated
content should offer reporting and blocking features and should
remove objectionable content. <a href="https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/wr0PCzq8n8H4yv5wCXhAu9PQzu?domain=developer.apple.com">Rule 5.1.2</a> says apps can’t use or
share someone’s personal information without permission, and 
<a href="https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/0EvSCA8LmLhEPMklt9i1uGY7-o?domain=developer.apple.com">Rule 5.6</a> says excessive customer reports and negative reviews
violate Apple’s Developer Code of Conduct. [...]</p>

<p>After going viral and generating controversy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/26/dating-safety-app-tea-breached-exposing-72000-user-images/">Tea suffered a data
breach over the summer</a>, with hackers gaining access to
72,000 images, including 3,000 selfies and photo IDs submitted for
account verification, as well as 59,000 images from posts,
comments, and direct messages.</p>

<p>Later, a rival app called TeaOnHer launched to offer men the
ability to dish on women in the same way, but it was beset by
security issues that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/a-rival-tea-app-for-men-is-leaking-its-users-personal-data-and-drivers-licenses/">exposed users’ personal information</a>,
including government IDs and selfies, TechCrunch
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/how-we-found-teaonher-spilling-users-drivers-licenses-in-less-than-10-minutes/">discovered</a> in August.</p>

<p>Seems odd to me that Apple only pulled Tea from the App Store now, three months after multiple disastrous security breaches revealed their amateur hour approach to security.
