<p>President Donald Trump ordered the United States to withdraw from 66 international organizations and UN-linked entities, according to a White House memorandum and reporting across multiple outlets. The list includes the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) treaty framework, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the UN Population Fund, among others. The administration said the targeted bodies &quot;no longer serve American interests&quot; and described them as operating contrary to US interests, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the review of additional organizations remains ongoing. The move deepens a broader US pullback from some multilateral efforts, after the administration also moved to leave the Paris climate accord since returning to office.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uAeT5c29k0c_RE8AQiSVMrDxCFMk3kg6ZQ7D3HS6NdRcCeQkWbf3QaVMHSPJV_fgCgvCLuZXoa_T4qkxeV5R0R4sQBRWj9gY_mBT35HZ7z7jZPoxNEu098CbgrWgQYiWhYcU0whiqc4aU3ElTffTdIT7EHyYUMrbbej13E7_W6YMcX0n7DGNDHTWrRwtFKQ7Ctr_Hl8DDKB2ITzhRexiz7fev2hs2qJgjhNWLVfA64hjwOJCMZLB2ulchJZl0UAWhJuQylL5ItpgwxISiA' alt='FILE - The symbol of the United Nations is displayed outside the Secretariat Building, Feb. 28, 2022, at United Nations Headquarters.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Treaty mechanics: UNFCCC was adopted at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and was approved by the US Senate later that year, and articles noted the US Constitution is clear on entering treaties but silent on withdrawal procedures—creating potential legal ambiguity.</li><li>Global participation: Articles describing the UNFCCC noted that 198 countries have approved or ratified the convention, and Politico reported the US would become the only nation ever to leave it.</li><li>Scope of exits: The organizations named are largely UN-related agencies, commissions, and advisory panels spanning climate, labor, migration, and social policy—areas the administration has criticized as tied to diversity and &quot;woke&quot; initiatives.</li><li>Notable inclusions: Some coverage highlighted that the withdrawal list includes the India-led International Solar Alliance, alongside other UN-linked bodies.</li><li>Diplomatic backdrop: Politico reported the US did not send a delegation to Brazil for COP30 late last year, while Trump officials have instead pursued fossil-fuel-related deals with other countries.</li></ul><blockquote>These withdrawals keep a key promise President Trump made to Americans — we will stop subsidising globalist bureaucrats who act against our interests.
