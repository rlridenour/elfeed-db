<p>&#8220;You want to know why philosophy matters? This is the true answer, and the one upon which we must plant our flag: philosophy is the most productive force ever discovered by human beings and we are responsible for modernity. Philosophy is the great gear deep in the heart of the world, and when that gear moves, the Earth trembles.&#8221;<span id="more-56300"></span></p>

<p>That&#8217;s <a href="https://stevenhales.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven Hales</a>, professor of philosophy at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, in a glorious rallying cry posted at his newsletter, <a href="https://hilariusbookbinder.substack.com/p/why-philosophy-matters-b35" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Scriptorium Philosophia</em></a>.</p>
<p>He continues:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>It is philosophers who created systematic ethics, interconnected principles defensible by reason, instead of mere lists of rules handed out by the gods. We are the ones who developed formal logic and the laws of deductive inference. We are the ones who criticized the divine right of kings and laid down the foundations of constitutional governments. We are the inventors and architects of the scientific method.</em></p>
<p>He notes that &#8220;philosophy is the first academic discipline, the first show from which all the others are spin-offs&#8221; and proceeds to describe the disciplinary speciation philosophy gave rise to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, philosophers have &#8220;sacrificed everything&#8221; to bring you all of this, he says, recounting many of the philosophers who have been punished or killed for philosophizing in history. And now today, there&#8217;s this: &#8220;our entire field is under attack by a managerial class convinced the only purpose of college is getting 22-year-olds their first job. They are cynics who know the price of everything but the value of nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He writes about the personal and cultural importance of philosophy, the humanities more broadly, and the arts, telling philosophers to stand tall.</p>
