<p>Sri Lanka has declared a state of emergency after Cyclone Ditwah unleashed days of torrential rain, floods and landslides that have killed around 190 people, with roughly 200 still missing across the island nation as of Sunday. The storm, which has now moved away from Sri Lanka, destroyed more than 20,000–25,000 homes and severely damaged many more, forcing over 120,000 people into state-run shelters and leaving close to one million in need of some form of assistance. Large parts of the capital region, especially low‑lying northern Colombo along the Kelani River, remain under water as runoff from heavy upstream rains continues to swell the river even after the cyclone’s departure, cutting roads, knocking out power and water systems, and disrupting communications in about a third of the country. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has appealed for international aid, with neighboring India already sending relief supplies and helicopters and other countries such as Japan and Pakistan pledging or dispatching assistance to support ongoing rescue and relief operations by Sri Lankan troops, officials and volunteers.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/_MVmfH25A6zH7FB54P7f4K24sNKTIve9uuN7TbGDxludJvgoi4rnqqRkcXaIs9TVnMZ5wYzTeh_FYJj12Q0F_TGNEOG4Jh-sWP8JWrVCSYpc' alt='Floodwater covers a main road on the outskirts of Colombo after heavy rains linked to Cyclone Ditwah.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of displacement: Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Centre reports that more than 266,000 families—about 968,000 people—have been affected by the cyclone’s flooding and landslides nationwide.</li><li>Colombo inundation: Northern districts of the Colombo metropolitan area face a major flood as the swollen Kelani River overflows its banks, submerging roads and neighbourhoods despite rainfall easing in much of the island.</li><li>Critical infrastructure hit: Officials estimate that around one‑third of Sri Lanka currently lacks electricity or piped water because floodwaters damaged power lines and water purification facilities, while internet connectivity has also been disrupted.</li><li>Military mobilisation: Sri Lanka has deployed army, navy and air force personnel alongside civilian workers and local volunteers to conduct evacuations, deliver supplies and clear blocked roads in badly affected central and western regions.</li><li>India’s rapid support: India became the first foreign government to respond to Colombo’s appeal, sending relief material and two helicopters with crews to help search‑and‑rescue missions and airlift stranded residents from marooned communities.</li></ul><blockquote>Although the cyclone has left us, heavy rains upstream are now flooding low-lying areas along the banks of the Kelani River. - Unnamed Disaster Management Centre official</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Sri Lankan government: The president framed the emergency declaration and appeal for international assistance as necessary steps to cope with widespread destruction, displaced families and major infrastructure outages following Cyclone Ditwah.
