<p>The United States entered a partial government shutdown on Jan. 31 after Congress missed a funding deadline, even as the Senate passed a compromise meant to keep most agencies funded through September and limit disruption. Because the House of Representatives was not scheduled to vote until Monday at the earliest, the lapse was widely expected to be short. The standoff centers on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding and the tactics of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Multiple outlets report Democrats pushed to separate DHS from other spending bills and demanded changes or accountability measures after federal immigration agents killed two US citizens, Alex Pretti and Renee Good, during an immigration crackdown, with Minneapolis cited as a flashpoint. President Trump endorsed the Senate deal, which includes a short-term DHS extension while lawmakers continue negotiating potential ICE reforms.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/nUezGCxpk0InoRWN-MTY8icTL1OLoAv_VyvSRewl3Xek0APE0JOPbvVav5nSdgmDoSZcurdW_X9OUY7TFflxpnhN6fNEusI1x0TVM0sJher14cK1fiX-XqykwkbiuGOn' alt='Posters mourning Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Senate vote: The Senate approved the package 71–29, overcoming opposition from a small group of Republicans while sending the plan to the House for action early next week.</li><li>DHS two-week: The agreement funds DHS only for roughly two weeks, creating a near-term deadline focused on whether ICE oversight or operating rules will be tightened.</li><li>What stays open: Reports said disruption should be limited because the compromise funds large parts of government—including areas such as defense and health programs—while DHS remains the main unresolved piece.</li><li>ICE reform menu: Democrats’ stated demands in the talks include judicial warrants for stops and searches, enforceable use-of-force standards, body cameras, and limits on masks and broad “roving” sweeps.</li><li>Shutdown contrast: One account contrasted the expected brief lapse with a previous year’s shutdown described as lasting 43 days and costing an estimated US$11 billion.</li></ul><blockquote>This is a moment of truth - Chuck Schumer</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: He backed the bipartisan funding approach publicly and urged both parties to support it to keep the government operating while negotiations continue.
