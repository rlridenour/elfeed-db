<p id="p2">Today, in tandem with new video recording capabilities and lenses in the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-announces-iphone-17-17-pro-and-17-pro-max/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 17 Pro line</a>, Apple announced version 2.0 of Final Cut Camera, its pro video recording app for the iPhone.</p>
<p id="p3">The update introduces support for ProRes RAW and genlock, which the new iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are able to record in. ProRes RAW is an industry-standard way to record video, allowing the capture of RAW data, which unlocks incredible control of recorded video in post-production. In upcoming releases of Final Cut Pro for Mac and Final Cut Pro for iPad, exposure, color temperature, tint, and demosaicing can all be adjusted on ProRes RAW footage.</p>
<p id="p4">Genlock, a process of synchronizing multiple video sources by having them lock onto an external reference signal, will allow filmmakers to make frame-accurate edits in a fraction of the time it would take when doing so manually.</p>
<p id="p5">As part of the recording process, version 2.0 supports open gate recording, allowing the use of the whole camera sensor to capture video, instead of the current cropped version. This opens up possibilities for reframing shots, stabilizing footage, and setting final aspect ratios without reducing the quality of the image.</p>
<p id="p6">As well as these announcements, Final Cut Camera introduces the following new functionalities:</p>
<ul id="ul7"><li>Support for recording in portrait and landscape using the new square sensor-equipped front-facing camera. The new camera can shoot portrait or landscape video without the need to rotate the device</li>
<li>Manual adjustment of the new front-facing camera on the iPhone 17 Pro</li>
<li>Support for Apple Log 2, which features a wider color gamut</li>
<li>New Timecode options like Time of Day or other external timecodes. </li>
<li>Support for recording ProRes up to 4K60 fps with the new 200mm telephoto lens on the iPhone 17 Pro</li>
</ul><p id="p8">Final Cut Camera will be available later this month.</p>
