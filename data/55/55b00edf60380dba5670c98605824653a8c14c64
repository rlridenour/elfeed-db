<blockquote>
  <p>“The experience supports Markdown style input and files for users
who prefer to work directly with the lightweight markup language,”
explains Dave Grochocki, principal product manager lead for
Microsoft’s Windows inbox apps. “You can switch between formatted
Markdown and Markdown syntax views in the view menu or by
selecting the toggle button in the status bar at the bottom of the
window.”</p>

<p>Since Notepad is usually used with plain text, you can also easily
clear all formatting from the formatting toolbar or from the edit
menu in the app. If you’re not a fan of the lightweight formatting
options, you can also fully disable this new support in the
Notepad app settings. [...]</p>

<p>Like I wrote in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/676258/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-steamos-notepad">my Notepad newsletter earlier this week</a>,
it’s amazing that Microsoft barely touched Notepad for decades,
and now it’s gone from basic log file reader to writing messages
itself. A lot of Notepad’s new features have arrived since
Microsoft decided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/3/23857331/microsoft-wordpad-windows-removal-end-of-support">remove WordPad from Windows</a>, after
nearly 30 years.</p>
