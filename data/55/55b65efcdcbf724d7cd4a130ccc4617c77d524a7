<p>Yep, this is a little late. I&rsquo;m actually in the process of migrating this blogs hosting to <a href="https://codeberg.org/">Codeberg</a> pages. It&rsquo;s part way there but having some difficulty with DNS/CNAME stuff. I can&rsquo;t connect to my regular domain <em>&lsquo;bledley.xyz&rsquo;</em>. If you&rsquo;re seeing this at the time of posting it will possibly have the url <em>&lsquo;bledley.codeberg.page&rsquo;</em>. This <em>should</em> only be temporary.. <em>I think</em>..</p>
<p>Also, I have a personal agreement with myself that I definitely don&rsquo;t intend to post week notes every single week. That&rsquo;d get pretty boring I reckon. I&rsquo;ll just post them when I feel like it.</p>

<p>Had some positive meetings about potentially putting on a Gaza fundraising music event at a cool venue in September.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completed a personal project of getting all the applications I use to switch light mode/dark mode with a simple key bind. Some were easier than others.. Emacs and Neovim were the ones I needed to get to play ball and finally got that sorted with <a href="https://github.com/LionyxML/auto-dark-emacs">auto-dark.el</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Mofiqul/adwaita.nvim">adwaita.nvim</a>.</p>

<li>A poor week for non-digital or actual book reading. I did get gifted a new book though called <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/1983/tom-cox/9781800183438">&lsquo;1983&rsquo; by Tom Cox</a> which is nearby and ready to go.</li>

<li>It was my birthday last week and some fun nights led to lazy days and not getting enough exercise. I ran twice - and not very far or very fast.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="watched-">Watched 📽</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve finished all the Narcos &amp; Narcos Mexico - loved that, great show - the early Escobar stuff especially. Feels like we could potentially see another series about El Chapo and those that survived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28 Years Later - what an odd film. I need to find someone else whose seen it to talk about the bizarre ending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alien:Earth is coming this week, pretty hyped about that.</p>
