<p>Venezuelan and Cuban officials say a U.S. operation in Caracas to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro resulted in significant deaths among their security forces, with Venezuela reporting at least 24 Venezuelan security officers killed and Cuba saying 32 of its military and police personnel died. Venezuela’s government has announced a week of mourning, while Cuba declared two days of mourning and published the names, ranks and ages of those killed. The U.S. has defended the raid as a law-enforcement action tied to U.S. charges, and debates have intensified over what Washington’s role will be in post-Maduro Venezuela.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/mGkt5UyVjQJ0nMqEdql1jNk4WrT8Bq-V4R1wSF2U0BfrAr7g2z7kA2NUnu6W9dy1ar9S6QWXNv07CVgHPurRWAdOlHlvqHTxBOMIEdWAJfR7pYKCtAoWbOthzpOkNwFwQpW6_31uyqqSXukjHRdrgvWjCR1vvCvgogCwVphtfg' alt='Image used with reporting on Cuba releasing details of officers killed during the U.S. raid in Venezuela.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Civilian losses: Venezuela’s attorney general said “dozens” of civilians and military personnel died overall, without providing a breakdown.</li><li>Interim stance: Interim leader Delcy Rodríguez said “no foreign power” is running Venezuela, as she signaled mixed willingness to cooperate with Washington.</li><li>Next target: U.S. pressure has reportedly shifted toward Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, with reporting that he could become a target unless he helps meet U.S. demands and maintain order.</li><li>Messaging split: Secretary of State Marco Rubio has framed the action as a “law enforcement operation,” while President Trump has said the U.S. is “in charge,” creating mixed public signals about governance.</li><li>Global signal: Analysts described China as unsettled by the manner of Maduro’s seizure and warned the uncertainty could test Beijing’s partnership with Caracas and complicate its regional strategy.</li></ul><blockquote>We’re in charge. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States government: U.S. officials defended the operation as justified and tied to bringing Maduro to the United States to face federal charges, framing it as a law-enforcement action.
