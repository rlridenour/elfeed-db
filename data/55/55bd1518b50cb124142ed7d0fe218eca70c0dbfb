<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladys_West">Gladys Mae West</a> was born in rural Virginia in 1930, grew up working on a tobacco farm, and died earlier this month a celebrated mathematician whose work made possible the GPS technology most of us use each and every day. Hers was a distinctively American life, in more ways than one. Seeking an escape from the agricultural labor she’d already gotten to know all too well, she won a scholarship to Virginia State College by becoming her high school class valedictorian; after earning her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mathematics, she taught for a time and then applied for a job at the naval base up in Dahlgren. She first distinguished herself there by verifying the accuracy of bombing tables with a hand calculator, and from there moved on up to the computer programming team.</p>
<p>This was the early nineteen-sixties, when programming a computer meant not coding, but laboriously feeding punch cards into an enormous mainframe. West and her colleagues used IBM’s first transistorized machine, the 7030 (or “Stretch”), which was for a few years the fastest computer in the world.</p>

<p>It cost an equivalent of $81,860,000 in today’s dollars, but no other computer had the power to handle the project of calculating the precise shape of Earth as affected by&nbsp;gravity and the nature of the oceans. About a decade later, another team of government scientists made use of those very same calculations when putting together the model employed by the World Geodetic System,&nbsp;which GPS satellites still use today. Hence the tendency of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/science/gladys-west-dead.html">celebratory obituaries to underscore the point</a> that&nbsp;without West’s work, GPS wouldn’t be possible.</p>

<p>Nor do any of them neglect to point out the fact that West was black,&nbsp;one of just four such mathematicians&nbsp;working for the Navy at Dahlgren. Stories like hers have drawn much greater public interest since the success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures"><em>Hidden Figures</em></a>, the Hollywood adaptation of <a href="https://amzn.to/465nf3w">Margot Lee Shetterly’s book</a> about the black female mathematicians at NASA during the Space Race. When that movie came out, in 2016, even West’s own children didn’t know the importance of the once-classified work she’d done. Only in 2018, when she provided that information on a biographical form she filled out for an event hosted by her college sorority, did it become public. She thus spent the last years of her long life as a celebrity, sought out by academics and journalists eager to understand the contributions of another no-longer-hidden figure. But to their questions about her own GPS use, she reportedly answered that she preferred a good old-fashioned paper map.</p>
