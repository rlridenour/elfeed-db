The plot and some of the comedy won't work today, but it was clear from the start that this movie is not about the movie - it's about the music. </p><p>Famous songs, famous musicians (there was a part where I was like "wait a minute, is that actually Ray Charles? Shiiiit, this is Ray Charles!"), and just a whole lot of fun. They don't make such crazy car chases anymore.</p><p>I'm glad I didn't do reading before the movie and went into it pretty much completely blank (as I said, I didn't remember anything), it simply showed on my Netflix queue, and I was thinking, sure, why not.</p><p>Good stuff, it definitely heightened my weekend by a notch.</p>
