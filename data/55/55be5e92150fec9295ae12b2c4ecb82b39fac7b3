Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Examine my thoughts <br></br>
on this Palm Sunday.
</p>

 <p>
Does my Jesus… <br></br></p>

 <p>
Want the very same things I want? <br></br>
Love only the same people I love? <br></br>
Hate all of the same people I hate? <br></br>
Have an agenda that fits too easily into my own agenda? <br></br>
Never say anything that makes me uncomfortable? <br></br></p>

 <p>
If so, then what is the object of my worship? <br></br>
Is it a god of my own creation, <br></br>
or is it the God who created me?
</p>

 <p>
Test my heart, O Lord, <br></br>
and may my innermost desires <br></br>
be made transparent,
</p>

 <p>
Even to myself.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
