<p>Happy New Year? I dearly hope it&rsquo;s better than the last one for all of us, but time and reality is gradually sanding the corners off my innate and irrepressible optimism.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for the rest of the world, but this is how the end part of the last year was for me, and what 2026 looks like.</p>
<p>A lot of lovely things happened in the first three quarters of last year. For one, I was able to make a long-delayed work trip to Indonesia &mdash; my first International trip post-pandemic! &mdash; which was wonderful. I got bitten by every biting insect in the region, but this is normal for me. I regard it as a minor tax on the privileged opportunity to see beautiful natural things, and to meet lovely people. That mosquito that bit me on the eyelid while I slept was particularly sneaky though. I woke up in the middle of the night unable to open one eye properly. I wondered briefly if I had suffered a stroke, but feeling my face with my hands as I pulled various expressions in the dark and felt whether they were symmetrical reassured me that it was unlikely to be that. It will wait until morning, I thought. And it did. In the morning, I looked like I had been involved in a bar fight, with a puffy, half-closed eye, but otherwise all was well.</p>
<p>Things got much tougher later in the year. My <a href="https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/no-bounce-in-my-bungee/">ME/CFS</a> had been gradually getting worse, even after reducing my hours, but by the last quarter of the year, I was really struggling, and going through the horribly familiar &lsquo;crash/recover/crash&rsquo; cycle regularly. Activities that I could do previously without consequence now precipitated a crash, and I could feel my world shrinking in again. However, in the last month of the year, I started seeing specialists at a private Long Covid/ME clinic. I&rsquo;m fortunate that we can just about manage this financially, as the waiting lists for the NHS clinics are extremely long. They have been fantastic, and we have started the long process of figuring out what would work best for me. Medication is helping a lot with one of the (many) groups of symptoms, though we still need to tackle the fatigue aspect. It&rsquo;s extra work to manage all of that, but it is great to be working with people who really understand what life is like with Long Covid or ME, and are experts in how to make things better. I think I would say that I am starting to feel more confident that I can come out the other side of it. However, I am acutely aware that &mdash; in order to get to that point &mdash; I have to strictly police my own stubborn tendency to try to power through things and tough them out. The clinic has helped me to monitor my energy levels and other symptoms, and it is clear that trying to manage in this way is completely counter-productive. I need to be strict with myself and rest as soon as I feel the first warning signs, not <em>after</em> I have crashed.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t (and don&rsquo;t want to) say much about the other big life event this year, but it involves a big change in my employment situation. I&rsquo;ve more or less come to terms with it now that I have made the decision and I know the timeline, but it has been &mdash; as these things always are &mdash; emotionally difficult and quite bruising. The next couple of years are likely to be tough, but in many ways I am looking forward to a new start and the chance to refocus and use my skills in different ways. You see, the corners of my irrepressible optimism have been only lightly sanded&hellip;</p>
<p>The most recent &lsquo;what now!?&rsquo; situation happened a couple of days ago. Just as Storm Goretti hit with an unusually large fall of snow and freezing temperatures in our area, our heating failed. We spent a very cold evening and night, then called the heating engineer who services our boiler. He valiantly battled through the snow to get to us among other emergency calls (luckily they are quite local), and identified the fault. He needs to order the part and return to fit it, but he set things up for us so that we can manually switch the boiler between the heating and hot water. It&rsquo;s an enormous relief, and we are very lucky that it is a small part and not a whole new boiler that needs to be replaced. Other areas (particularly Cornwall and the South West) have had it much worse in this storm, with very high winds and power outages, so we got off lightly.</p>
<p>Throughout the difficulties of the year, there have been interests and hobbies which have acted as a sanctuary for me. I&rsquo;m finding sewing difficult at the moment (frustratingly) because of the time and physical effort it takes for me to set all the equipment up and pack it away, as we have no space to leave things set up. However, knitting and crochet has fulfilled that space of gently making something with my hands, and I have been obsessed with <a href="https://attic24.co.uk/posts/aria-blanket/">Lucy&rsquo;s Aria blanket</a>. I bought a kit of the required yarns, and have been loving every new combination of colours that comes off my hook, and the way that each square sings against the others. It&rsquo;s ideal for my energy levels as I can sit quietly and make and join one square and get a boost from the joyfulness of making something beautiful with my hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Computer pottering&rsquo; and Linux enjoyment has also been a delight this year. I have to use a Mac for work (well, it&rsquo;s that or Windows&hellip;), but I haven&rsquo;t used my Mac mini for months now and have been daily-driving Linux full time on my home computer. NixOS and <a href="https://yalter.github.io/niri/">niri</a> continue to be rewarding to explore, and I am slowly building up my knowledge of <a href="https://www.darktable.org">darktable</a> for photo processing. I have an ongoing list of little things to add, fix or enhance, and enjoy picking one to work on in the evenings or weekends. I really love the feeling of <em>serenity</em> and quiet focus that I have with NixOS and niri. Everything is efficient, set up the way that works best for me, and I don&rsquo;t get interrupted by notifications every five minutes. It&rsquo;s just quiet, calm focus and efficiency.</p>
<p>Since I mentioned photo processing, I would like to get back to taking more photos again. I took my Fujifilm X100T out on a recent short walk (in the first batch of snow we got before Storm Goretti), and had fun with it, even though my focusing skills are quite rusty. I&rsquo;d like to do more of that, if for no other reason that it forces me to be patient with my reduced energy and take natural short breaks and pauses in my walks to compose photos. I have always been a fast walker, and my brain has not yet caught up with the fact that I can&rsquo;t go at that pace now without setting off a crash. If I can&rsquo;t do long walks, noticing things and taking the time to try to capture their beauty helps me make the most of the time I have outdoors.</p>
<p>One other thing I would like to work on this year is possibly moving my blog to another host. Netlify is great, but it is evident that they are focusing on business customers not teeny-tiny hobbyists like me, and I worry that it will become a place where we teeny-tiny &lsquo;small web&rsquo; folk are not welcome. I had been considering cancelling Commento (the comment service that powers comments on this blog). However, while writing this post, I realised with a shock that the comments weren&rsquo;t rendering at all on my blog. I did some digging, and found (with an even greater shock) that the domain has expired, and that other users who have tried to cancel their recurring subscriptions have not had a response. I hope that the developer is ok, but it leaves the rest of us with a bit of a mess to clear up, so I ended up spending yesterday trying to cancel the payments through my credit card.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know how long the service has been down for: the comments don&rsquo;t render (by design) when I preview the site locally, and when people comment, I get notified by email and respond there. So I&rsquo;m sorry if the comments have been missing for ages. I just thought it had gone quiet, as it does sometimes! Anyway, I have now properly integrated the <a href="https://letterbird.co">Letterbird email contact form</a> instead. I have loved having comments (for most of the life of this blog), but people tend to engage in other ways now (e.g. on Mastodon). I introduced the Letterbird form a while ago, and I have had some lovely emails from readers though it, and been able to respond with equally detailed responses. Do give it a try if you&rsquo;d like to say hello!</p>
<p>I hope anyone reading this is as well as can be expected, and has at least some things to look forward to this year. I&rsquo;ve found myself adding an audible question mark to my New Year&rsquo;s greetings to people this year, so I wish you all (ungrammatically) a Happy New Year?</p>
