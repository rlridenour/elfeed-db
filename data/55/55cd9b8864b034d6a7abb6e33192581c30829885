<p>In 2005, Jeremy Winterson bought a bootleg copy of <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> in Shanghai and noticed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115091456/http://winterson.com/2009/01/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west-redux.html">something wrong with the English subtitles</a>. </p>
<p>The movie&#8217;s dialogue had been translated mechanically into Chinese and then translated back again into English, leaving it almost incomprehensible. (A similar disaster had befallen a <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2013/06/12/lost-in-translation/">Portuguese-French</a> <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2015/05/18/podcast-episode-58-english-as-she-is-spoke/">phrasebook</a> in 1883.)</p>
<p>Fans replaced the movie&#8217;s original audio dialogue with voice actors reading the mistranslated subtitles, and the result is <em>Star War the Third Gathers: Backstroke of the West</em> (highlights above).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/star-wars-revenge-sith-bootleg-chinese-dialogue-is-a-masterpiece-960452/">The <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> called it a &#8220;masterpiece.&#8221;</a></p>
