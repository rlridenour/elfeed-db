<p>Something odd has been happening to me lately. Every morning, when I take off my pyjamas and get dressed, I take the time to fold them neatly, making sure that the pleat at the back is squared up, and the sleeves smoothed and carefully lined up. Then, each week after one pair of pyjamas is washed, I lug out the ironing board and iron the freshly laundered pair.</p>
<p>This is, to put it mildly, out of character for me. What is going on?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s deal with the ironing part first, as that is particularly perplexing. I have had the same iron since I was at University more than thirty years ago, so that probably gives you some idea how often it has been used in the intervening years. Until I started sewing, it only got brought out when I absolutely couldn&rsquo;t avoid ironing some outfit for an interview, wedding, or other special occasion.</p>
<p>I use it more now, because pressing (technically different from ironing, but both involve an iron) is such a critical step in sewing a garment. Nevertheless, many of the clothes I make might never see an iron again in their lives after that first pressing. Indeed, when I am pressing something I am making, I warn them about this, in the manner of a WWI Captain delivering bad news to his troops, sleeve roll under one armpit like a swagger stick, and an iron in the other. &ldquo;Now, look here, it&rsquo;s a bally shame, but you are going to have to make this pressing last. After this, you are on your own &mdash; stiff upper lip and collar and all that! We have to make the best of it, d&rsquo;you see?&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I do see the point of ironing clothes after they have been made, but a) I am lazy, and b) regularly flattening something with a hot bit of metal has always seemed a bit of a waste of energy. I prefer to try to dry clothes carefully on the line so that the creasing is minimal.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the folding. I do fold clothes, but up until now, I have had a very rough and ready approach to folding pyjamas, which has nudged closer to &lsquo;crumple&rsquo; than &lsquo;fold&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So why iron and fold at all, and why do so with my pyjamas? After all, almost no-one gets to see my pyjamas apart from Mr. Bsag, and creases in clothing are of absolutely no importance or interest to him<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I think that the simple answer is that I do it only for myself, because it gives me joy.</p>
<p>I put a lot of effort and care into making two pairs of <a href="https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/christmas-crafting/">these pyjamas</a>. I have made pyjamas before, but some combination of the excellent pattern (<a href="https://closetcorepatterns.com/collections/sewing-patterns-all/products/fran-pajama-sewing-pattern?variant=40346264666246">Fran pyjamas by Closet Core</a>) and the lovely soft, thick cotton gingham material means that they are the nicest, most comfortable and cosiest pyjamas I have ever worn. They feel like a luxury, and I invested time, care and attention into making them. So folding them carefully each morning is a joy and a promise to myself. I will take care of my pyjamas, and they will take care of me at the end of the day, when I am tired and stressed and desperate for sleep. When I get ready for bed, there they are &mdash; neatly folded, and promising comfort, softness and rest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not where I expected to be, and yet here we are. Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I have an appointment with an ironing board.</p>
