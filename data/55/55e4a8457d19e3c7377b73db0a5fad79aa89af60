<li>Here’s a <a href="https://d2b8wt72ktn9a2.cloudfront.net/mediocre/image/upload/v1749651680/maptqiiqt2banufqnjzq.png">Size Chart</a></li>

</ul><h1>The Beach Beckons</h1><p>It’s almost time for a trip to the beach!</p>
<p>But what exactly do you need to bring? It can be overwhelming packing a beach bag, right?</p>
<p>Not if you have our… <strong>HANDY BEACH DAY CHECKLIST</strong>!</p>
<p>Here’s what you should take along:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A pair of swim trunks, obviously! Whether you plan on going out for a big swim or just wading into the waves, you’ll want something fun and tropical-looking to wear in and out of the water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A variety of <a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/stuff-you-should-buy-before-it-s-95">summer gear</a>, like towels, water bottles, waterproof bags, and a rapid cold brewer. Okay, fine, that last one might not be perfect for <em>bringing</em> to the beach, but you could make some cold brew to bring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A nice lunch. After all, concession stand food is so overpriced. So you’ll want to <a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/cook-like-no-one-s-watching-they-re-not">cook something at home</a> so you can save a little cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/you-re-not-hungry-you-re-just-bored">Snacks</a>, duh! For you to share with your friends–human or otherwise–before and after eating said packed lunch!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some <a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/gadgets-you-ll-pretend-improve-your-life">fun gadgets</a>, like a power bank for your phone so you can keep the tunes cranking all day!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/it-s-basically-sold-out-but-go-ahead">Something that recently sold out</a>, so that when your friend asks, “Hey, whoa! How do I get one of those?” you can act all superior about the great price you got it for before adding, “But unfortunately, I don’t think it’s available anymore. Gosh, so sorry.” Because what is friendship if not a contest!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sidedeal.com/events/this-stuff-had-nowhere-else-to-go">Some… ummm… totally random stuff</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://meh.com/deals/instant-regret-kit-76">A big old pile of bullshit that you can bury in the sand to entertain the metal detector crowd</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, kinda went off the rails there at the end. But you have to admit, we were really doing a good job of effortlessly shoehorning these SideDeal-o-Rama events into this write-up. Which is your reminder: there is currently a SideDeal-o-Rama happening, and for every dollar you spend there (or anywhere on SideDeal), you get 50 cents off your IRK (up to $30; more details on <a href="https://meh.com/deals/instant-regret-kit-76">the IRK sale</a>).</p>
<p>So get some trunks, and then get some other stuff, and then get an IRK, and then go to the beach!</p>
