<p>It appears that all of those editors, as well as the executive board and editorial board members from <em>The Journal of Philosophical Logic</em>, will be taking up their same roles at the new journal.</p>
<p>The following is an announcement from the editors, board members, and former editors of <em>The Journal of Philosophical Logic</em> about their actions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">All Editors-in-Chief and Associate Editors of the <em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em>, currently published by Springer Nature, have informed Springer Nature of their resignation. Some of the editors will continue working for Springer Nature for a limited period. They will keep processing papers through the review and publication pipeline for the <em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em> until the end of their terms.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The <em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em> was founded in 1972 by Nicholas Rescher with Bas van Fraassen serving as the first Editor-in-Chief. It was originally published by D. Reidel Publishing, later by Kluwer, and finally by Springer. In accordance with The Journal of Philosophical Logic Charter, an Executive Board has overseen the selection of editors for the journal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Today marks the launch of a new Diamond Open Access journal, <a href="https://www.philosophical-logic.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Philosophical Logic</em></a>, published by the <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Library of Humanities</a> (OLH) and not affiliated with Springer Nature or the <em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em> published by Springer Nature. The undersigned support efforts to make academic research—produced, refereed, and curated by scholars—as accessible as possible to both the academic community and society at large. We are encouraged by several recent launches of Diamond Open Access journals in Logic and Philosophy, including <a href="https://zml.international" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Zeitschrift für Mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik</em></a>, as well as <a href="https://politicalphilosophyjournal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Political Philosophy</em></a> and <a href="https://freeandequaljournal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Free and Equal</em></a>, both published by OLH, following successful launches of Diamond Open Access journals in nearby fields, such as <a href="https://www.glossa-journal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Glossa</em></a> and <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/opmi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Open Mind</em></a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Philosophical Logic</em> welcomes original research in all areas of philosophical logic. The new journal will maintain the same high editorial standards that we upheld at the <em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em>. In our view, hiring and promotion committees should regard publication in <em>Philosophical Logic</em> as no less significant than publication in the <em>Journal of Philosophical Logic </em>was before.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The undersigned members of the Executive Board have been part of the <em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em> as authors, reviewers, or editors for decades. It is the view of the Executive Board that Rescher’s vision of a journal serving the philosophical logic community lives on with <em>Philosophical Logic</em>. We are grateful to OLH for committing to long-term funding of <em>Philosophical Logic</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We thank the philosophical logic community for its support in the launch of <em>Philosophical Logic</em>, and we look forward to receiving your submissions at <a href="https://www.philosophical-logic.org/">https://www.philosophical-logic.org</a>!</p>

<p>On its <a href="https://www.philosophical-logic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>, the new journal is described as &#8220;an international scientific journal that provides a venue for research at the intersection of philosophy and logic, with contributions ranging from conceptual analysis to technical developments.&#8221; It &#8220;invites papers not only in the traditional areas of philosophical logic but also on extensions of logic to new areas of application and on the philosophical issues to which these give rise.&#8221;</p>
