<p id="p1">Fascinating analysis by <a href="https://www.allenpike.com/2025/post-chat-llm-ui" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allen Pike</a> on how, beyond traditional chatbot interactions, the technology behind LLMs can be used in other types of user interfaces and interactions:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  While chat is powerful, for most products chatting with the underlying LLM should be more of a debug interface &ndash; a fallback mode &ndash; and not the primary UX.</p>
<p>  So, how is AI making our software more useful, if not via chat? Let&rsquo;s do a tour.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p3">There are plenty of useful, practical examples in the <a href="https://allenpike.com/2025/post-chat-llm-ui" rel="noopener noreferrer">story</a> showing how natural language understanding and processing can be embedded in different features of modern apps. My favorite example is search, as Pike writes:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  Another UI convention being reinvented is the search field.</p>
<p>  It used to be that finding your flight details in your email required typing something exact, like &ldquo;air canada confirmation&rdquo;, and hoping that&rsquo;s actually the phrasing in the email you&rsquo;re thinking of.</p>
<p>  Now, you should be able to type &ldquo;what are the flight details for the offsite?&rdquo; and find what you want.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">Having used <a href="https://www.shortwave.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shortwave</a> and its AI-powered search for the past few months, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. The moment you get used to searching without exact queries or specific operators, there&rsquo;s no going back.</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote6"><p>
  Experience this once, and products with an old-school text-match search field feel broken. You should be able to just find &ldquo;tax receipts from registered charities&rdquo; in your email app, &ldquo;the file where the login UI is defined&rdquo; in your IDE, and &ldquo;my upcoming vacations&rdquo; in your calendar.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p7">Interestingly, Pike mentions Command-K bars as another interface pattern that can benefit from LLM-infused interactions. I knew that sounded familiar &ndash; I <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/command-k-bars-as-a-modern-interface-pattern/" rel="noopener noreferrer">covered the topic</a> in mid-November 2022, and I still think it&rsquo;s a shame that Apple hasn&rsquo;t natively implemented these anywhere in their apps, especially now that commands can be fuzzier (just consider <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/hands-on-with-raycasts-new-ai-extensions/" rel="noopener noreferrer">what Raycast is doing</a>). Funnily enough, that post was published just two weeks before the public debut of ChatGPT on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23488017/openai-chatbot-chatgpt-ai-examples-web-demo" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 30, 2022</a>. That feels like forever ago now.</p>
