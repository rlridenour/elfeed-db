<p>Catherine Connolly, a left-leaning independent backed by Ireland&#x27;s left parties, won the presidential contest in a landslide and will serve as president of Ireland after the counting and concession over the weekend . Connolly ran on a platform of domestic reform and economic justice while taking an outspoken public stance on the war in Gaza, and she has said she will champion diversity and be a voice for peace and neutrality . The presidency in Ireland is largely ceremonial, so her victory is seen as a symbolic shift in public mood rather than a change to day-to-day government operations .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/WKOKchJ5wt-84QJJcgu953SARiXndi_LNVO_VJVmvb-uqNebNRvh_02yknIVPA868fr-ulS-6J9Kep1AqoKOyix8CHtUHbLMXc6U2EnothYlxfDaaPTE86cZg1FDfD1e7q8-CNJ64_6i3S_39m5oMy_IbdVpMjeR1Lz4qexD15MWf7JE-0Coi5d2Y0wfaR1NqbeorE_OF81N74FU08VmmYTgvlw_KpUEPhg7j9y1p0b4rebk-Qal2onyWFgboF8a9Ko4TxfV4PHKpg' alt='Catherine Connolly, elected president of Ireland, and Prime Minister Micheál Martin in Dublin, October 25, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Vote margin: Official tallies showed Connolly received roughly 63% of first-preference votes once spoiled ballots were excluded, compared with about 29% for rival Heather Humphreys .</li><li>Political signal: Observers described the result as a landslide that united left-leaning parties behind an independent and signalled a rebuke to Fine Gael’s centre-right position in this symbolic contest .</li><li>Foreign policy views: Connolly has been publicly critical of Israel’s actions in Gaza and has warned against the European Union’s growing &#x27;militarisation&#x27; since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine .</li><li>Personal profile: A veteran lawmaker and lawyer aged 68, Connolly is known for campaigning on reunification and long-term domestic reform rather than day-to-day executive power .</li></ul><blockquote>An inclusive president for all - Catherine Connolly</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Catherine Connolly: She pledged to be &#x27;an inclusive president for all&#x27; and said she would champion diversity and be a voice for peace that builds on Ireland&#x27;s policy of neutrality.
