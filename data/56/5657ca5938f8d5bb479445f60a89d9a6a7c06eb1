<li>A couple of magnesium supplement options</li>
<li>Maybe helps you fall asleep, maybe doesn’t</li>
<li>120 servings to try</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: We put this here to highlight a comment from <a href="/@alacrity">@alacrity</a> the last time we sold this, “did somebody not consider magnseritas here? really?” We’re embarrassed we didn’t think of this</li>
</ul><h1>Sleep Well</h1><p>Taking a magnesium supplement may aid in the process of falling asleep and may result in deeper, longer sleep. The studies, however, are inconclusive. So, if you plan on buying one of these magnesium supplements, it’s also important to practice good sleep health.</p>
<p>Here are three ways to improve your sleep hygiene TODAY!</p>
<p><strong>1. Avoid Blue Light From Phones &amp; Other Devices Before Sleep</strong></p>
<p>Sure, it can be tempting to lie in bed with your phone before going to sleep. But, according to studies, the blue light from phones can suppress the production of melatonin, which signals to your body that it’s time to wind down. That’s why it’s important to lay a thin green film over your phone’s screen, so that it makes teal light, which is probably totally fine.</p>
<p><strong>2. Invest In A Good White Noise Machine</strong></p>
<p>A bit of quiet can help you rest. But there is such a thing as too quiet. For this reason, many would benefit from a white noise machine in their bedroom. But a word to the wise: while some say the flavor of the white noise isn’t as rich, we recommend a propane white noise machine, as the charcoal-powered alternatives require you to wake several times each night to shovel more in, defeating the purpose.</p>
<p><strong>3. Find Your Happy Sleep Place</strong></p>
<p>Create an environment in your head where you can escape to after a busy day. As you lie down, visualize yourself in this space. For example, maybe you picture yourself in a rustic cabin somewhere deep in a forest. There’s no one in any direction for hundreds of miles. There, in that near total isolation–it’s just you and the wolves, after all–imagine lying on your mattress made of straws and sticks, pulling up your comforter of woven pine needles, and thinking about how, dang, it sure would’ve been nice if you’d been able to find a few more mushrooms. As it stands, you’ve only got three to get through the winter, which is rapidly approaching, if the cold breeze blowing through the holes in your wall and your blanket is any indication. Start planning your six-hour foraging hike for the next day. Then, exit this visualization, and realize how rad it is to be in a real bed in a real house. Fall asleep feeling comfortable.</p>
<p>Those are just a few tips of ours. If you have more of your own, feel free to share them in the comments. Otherwise, get some magnesium if you want it.</p>
