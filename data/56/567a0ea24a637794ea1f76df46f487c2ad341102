<p>The Louvre reopened to the public on Wednesday after closing for three days following a daytime robbery in which eight pieces of French royal jewellery were taken from the Apollo Gallery; the haul is valued at about €88 million (roughly $102 million) though that figure does not capture the items&#x27; historic worth [apnews.com#1][france24.com#1][aljazeera.com#1]. Authorities say the theft happened quickly in broad daylight and has prompted a national review of museum security, with President Emmanuel Macron ordering an acceleration of protective measures while the museum&#x27;s leadership faces parliamentary scrutiny [lemonde.fr#1][nytimes.com#1][france24.com#2].
