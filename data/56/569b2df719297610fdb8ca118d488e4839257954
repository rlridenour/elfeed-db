<p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the 2026 Oscar nominations, with Ryan Coogler’s vampire-era drama “Sinners” leading with 16 nods—a new nominations record—and Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” close behind with 13. The nomination list also underscored a more global Oscars: international films appeared across all four acting categories for the first time, and the best international feature race spans entries from Spain, Brazil, France, Tunisia and Norway. For Spain, Oliver Laxe’s “Sirât” picked up two nominations (international feature and sound), while Australia celebrated first-time acting nominations for Rose Byrne and Jacob Elordi, plus a surprise original-song mention for Nick Cave. The ceremony is scheduled for March 15, giving a few weeks for campaigns—and for audiences worldwide to discover new films and voices.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PDjEPJCAtMPNJOvkfDfGN-nFZHaXAj0GcG2bEdPquphJhFSJAskG6K48ImSCMpCaovgYwqV3SdvfhI4kB4LUHu_3itcwad6HFWkUBAQoJdx0w7WnYvoKD8MfRlu-dF_S9-IzVuHiT2Wz_f0KdjYETO4mvQk8uTfGBzJoOMtsbnluDO_WjI_bdjkOz6_J7G89jUecsUKSV0W-Z8SFm-CrGMYcBAWP2lnhfqPb00o' alt='Image accompanying El País coverage of “Sinners” leading the 2026 nominations.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Sound milestone: “Sirât”s sound designers Laia Casanovas, Amanda Villavieja and Yasmina Praderas became the first all-female team nominated for the sound Oscar, according to the film’s Spanish team.</li><li>Where it began: Laxe’s “Sirât” team watched the nominations together in Madrid at the Telefónica building lobby, with Telefónica listed as one of the film’s producers.</li><li>Aussie reactions: Byrne said she learned of her nomination overnight in Australia during a FaceTime call from husband Bobby Cannavale in New York, describing a burst of family celebration.</li><li>Del Toro’s run: Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” received nine nominations, with Jacob Elordi among the nominated performers tied to the film.</li><li>Surprises list: The BBC highlighted unexpected outcomes including Paul Mescal and Chase Infiniti missing out, while other performers helped carry their films into the nominations.</li></ul><blockquote>And then he started screaming, it was like ‘They said your name!’ - Rose Byrne</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Semafor: Semafor framed this year’s nominations as evidence the Oscars are looking beyond Hollywood, noting international films reached all four acting categories for the first time.
