<p>This year, YouTube celebrated its twentieth anniversary, prompting younger users to wonder what life could have been like before it. The fiftieth anniversary of <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em>, which premiered in April of 1975, has inspired similar reflection among comedy enthusiasts. It can be difficult, at this point, to imagine oneself back in a culture not yet disrupted by Monty Python’s rigorously absurd logic, scattershot satire, and deliberate breaking of narrative and social convention — a culture, indeed, where that sort of thing could be feared too dangerous for television and film.</p>
<p>It was their BBC sketch series <em>Monty Python’s Flying Circus</em> that introduced this comedic sensibility first to Britain, and then to the world. Between that show’s third and fourth seasons, the Pythons — Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam — took on the side project of creating their own cinematic re-interpretation of Arthurian legend.</p>

<p>With a modest budget furnished by <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/monty-holy-grail-python-led-zeppelin-pink-floyd-1138962/">Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull’s Ian Anderson</a>, and other investors connected to the music world, they plunged themselves into a grimy, unglamorous vision of the Middle Ages, punctuated by inexplicable anachronism and saturated with an iconoclastic disregard for received wisdom and trumped-up glory.</p>
<p>There the Pythons told a story that, while perhaps lacking in narrative structure — to say nothing of historical realism — more than compensates in sheer comic momentum. By all accounts, it holds up half a century on, even for those viewers who’ve already seen it so many times as to have involuntarily committed every joke to memory. In celebration of its anniversary, the film has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9B7fBPhWzU">become available to stream free</a> (albeit not in all regions of the world) on the official YouTube Movies &amp; TV channel, where the latest generations of Monty Python fans first discovered their work. Even if lines like <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2014/09/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-censorship-letter.html">“I fart in your general direction”</a> no longer raise any transgressive <em>frisson</em>,&nbsp;there’s still little on that platform’s universe of content to match <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em>’s multilayered silliness, whose place in the annals of comedy legend has long since been assured.</p>
