<p>North Korea has begun construction in Pyongyang of a &quot;Memorial Museum of Combat Feats&quot; to honor soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in the war tied to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, state media reported during a groundbreaking ceremony attended by leader Kim Jong Un and Russia&#x27;s ambassador . The project comes after multiple reports that Pyongyang covertly deployed forces to fight with Russian units abroad; North Korean state outlets framed the operation as fraternal military cooperation and Kim hailed closer ties with Moscow . Independent reporting and official statements offer differing accounts of the scale and toll of the deployments, leaving the precise number of troops and casualties unclear while the new museum seeks to commemorate those actions publicly .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/D6tPkNnS6f8DGYHRKV3l--Oxr5Vn-JuzXE-I4U3GNXY_o-57ajxtdOpkYv9_ppcbQ1GKnwMR15F_7ZPAuhZM3pdBUlx2kIa8z_OOQA1T5CgQr5WmPiNaRkwF2h0GHSbEzOCO6AxqSkHfhkhH0526iYmwxC6Y8jXoPBVfp0jYTRIBpVoo6xRxEnZbknll3hsPg-xYkOmdMSJFVc_QdKKSHJ1CzLKsdjAkUy463CmF3nOQf1t8C7uUMnpoGn0K1fRE8w' alt='Kim Jong Un at the groundbreaking for the memorial in Pyongyang, marking closer military ties with Russia' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Deployment scale: Investigative reporting estimates Pyongyang covertly sent roughly 10,000–12,000 troops to Russia in 2024 to assist operations in the Kursk area</li><li>Combat locations: Sources say North Korean units fought mainly in Russia&#x27;s Kursk region and were later seen supporting operations near Ukraine’s Sumy region</li><li>Casualty estimates: Estimates vary widely: President Zelensky suggested about 4,000 North Korean personnel were killed or wounded, while U.S. officials put a lower figure near 1,200 and other reports note several hundred deaths</li><li>Museum messaging: State media named the site the &#x27;Memorial Museum of Combat Feats&#x27; and described the project using language that casts the deployments as heroic service to a fraternal ally</li></ul><blockquote>The combatants of the armed forces of the Republic, who performed the brilliant military exploits and services in the military operations to liberate the Kursk Region of the fraternal Russian Federation at the cost of their blood and lives, - Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) via Politico</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Kim Jong Un / North Korean state media: Kim hailed advancing ties with Moscow and presided over the groundbreaking for a museum honoring those who fought alongside Russia .
