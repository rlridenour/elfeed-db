<p id="p1">Last week, I wrote about <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-introduces-a-mini-app-partner-program-featuring-a-reduced-commission/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s new policies surrounding mini apps</a>. However, that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ey6d8onl" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn&rsquo;t the only change</a> made to the App Review Guidelines last week. Apple also added <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#copycats" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new subsection &ldquo;c&rdquo; to its rule against Copycat apps</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  4.1(c) You cannot use another developer&rsquo;s icon, brand, or product name in your app&rsquo;s icon or name, without approval from the developer.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p3"><a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/how-does-this-keep-happening/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As I wrote earlier this year</a>, this isn&rsquo;t a new problem, especially for developers of popular games on other platforms. Copycat versions of Blue Prince, Palworld, Wordle, Cuphead, Balatro (before it was released on the App Store), and Unpacking have all appeared on the App Store in recent years.</p>
<p id="p4">The update to App Guideline 4.1 shows that Apple is aware of the problem, which is a step in the right direction. Hopefully, the awareness will lead to better enforcement, too.</p>
