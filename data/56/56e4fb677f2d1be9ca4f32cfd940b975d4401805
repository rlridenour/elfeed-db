<p>Russia said on October 26 that it successfully tested the 9M730 Burevestnik — a nuclear‑powered, nuclear‑capable cruise missile that Moscow says can stay airborne far longer than conventional missiles and fly along unpredictable paths, strengthening its strategic deterrent claims . President Vladimir Putin described the system as unique, and Russian officers said the trial included maneuvers to test evasion of interception . U.S. President Trump responded publicly, saying the tests are &quot;not appropriate&quot; and urging an end to the war in Ukraine while noting that the U.S. also conducts missile tests . Analysts and commentators warned the development could complicate missile‑defense planning and raise escalation risks in the Ukraine conflict .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/0_4q7crOWAMBwz5XEEYKxx6AUrQJ1qZb-0K13XVub56whevTVJLz3q4MU9yXc-bL8DDgx6TzSK3IwoYa7dRwV8fUk_6ODsjKhQKOpNgFhXXtKDe1F6fRkNFz3SkjBP8HK1-BlSComBRhO6msmdSqQD02q9EThQfoz1E7nK86u0UGUtc1lBF79OiPDErC9E_AkG90CEPt6veaJw' alt='President Vladimir V.
