<blockquote>
  <p>“This is misery,” Letterman said when asked about Kimmel’s
suspension, speaking at <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/theatlanticfestival/">The Atlantic Festival
2025</a> Thursday
in New York. “I feel bad about this,” he continued. “We see where
this is all going, correct? It’s managed media. And it’s no good.
It’s silly. It’s ridiculous. And you can’t go around firing
somebody because you’re fearful or trying to suck up to an
authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office. That’s
just not how this works.”</p>

<p>“In the world of somebody who is an authoritarian, maybe a
dictatorship, sooner or later, everyone is going to be touched,”
said Letterman.</p>

<p>Letterman also said, “The institution of the president of the
United States ought to be bigger than a guy doing a talk show.”
Kimmel’s removal from late-night TV, he said, “was predicted by
our president right after Stephen Colbert got walked off, so
you’re telling me this isn’t premeditated at some level?” [...]</p>

<p>On Wednesday, ABC suspended Kimmel’s late-night show
“indefinitely.” That came after FCC chairman Brendan Carr just
hours earlier threatened ABC and its affiliates if they didn’t
“take action” on Kimmel over what he perceived as objectionable
comments about Charlie Kirk’s killer. “We can do this the easy way
or the hard way,” Carr said on a conservative podcast. [...]</p>

<p>Regarding Carr’s comment that “we can do this the easy way or the
hard way,” Letterman said, “Who is hiring these goons — Mario
Puzo?”, referring to the author of <em>The Godfather</em>. Letterman said
when he was on TV, he never got pressure from a presidential
administration, the FCC or any other government agency about his
on-air commentary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Goons” is exactly the right word. Letterman’s commentary on this is, by far, the best I’ve seen, because it’s been the most clear-eyed. I quoted a lot above, but there’s more, so please read the whole piece. But this one extra snippet from the piece puts it on the right scale:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Goldberg posited that today, despite Trump’s attacks on the
press, “we still have a free media,” to which Letterman
responded, “Do we?”</p>
