Apple is likely to keep discussion of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> to a minimum at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> as it focuses on other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> enhancements, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Drake Bennett.</a><br/>

Apple will apparently focus on improving existing &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; capabilities and adding some new ones, such as an AI-optimized <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/ios-19-ai-battery-management/">battery management mode</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/30/ios-19-4-revamped-health-app-rumor/">virtual health coach</a>. Google Gemini is also on track to be added as a ChatGPT alternative for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Other upgrades to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, including the ones announced a year prior that include personal context and the ability to complete complex, multi-step actions, are "unlikely to be discussed much." The features are still "months away" from being released.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also reportedly planning to "separate the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; brand from &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in its marketing," owing to concerns that users' negative experience with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is harming opinions about &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
To help improve existing &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features, users' iPhones now apparently help improve Apple's synthetic data, the report explains. A set of artificial data is assessed and enhanced by comparing it to the language from users' iPhones to provide real-world reference points for AI training, without feeding in actual user information.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, in Texas, Spain, and Ireland, thousands of analysts are purportedly reviewing &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; summaries for accuracy by comparing its output against the source material. The company wants to determine how often the system is producing the distorted or inaccurate responses.<br/>

Apple's &zwnj;WWDC 2025&zwnj; keynote is scheduled for Monday, June 9, where the company will preview &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;, macOS 16, and other major software updates and features for its devices.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/siri-to-take-a-backseat-at-wwdc/">Siri Rumored to Take a Backseat at WWDC 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/siri-rumored-to-take-a-backseat-at-wwdc-2025.2457328/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
