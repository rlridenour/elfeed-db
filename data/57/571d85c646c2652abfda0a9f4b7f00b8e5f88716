<p>US officials briefed Congress on a September operation in which a US aircraft involved in a strike on a boat was made to resemble a civilian plane, prompting internal and external legal scrutiny. The Trump administration has argued the action took place in an armed conflict against suspected drug traffickers, but legal experts interviewed by outlets said the laws of war prohibit “perfidy,” such as feigning civilian status to conduct an attack. The reporting has sparked debate over whether the camouflage was a lawful ruse or an unlawful act that could endanger civilian aviation by blurring the line between civilian and military aircraft.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/9Md10YeCAOYx1jc6RM6kQjQLMR4plhEr05HFlpRyRzP9rM-JusgClaXoBHBe-klRn2Kv5rohtQ0gBT1toE73x4ZY02vcoyscx_Zlf5RsSItnK0RpabJklX25PGnrJDEgLVT68WPxmiqFm9ifSMC5rgzt6QwbZh2yOHQwuHDxr0Z9EkAplf93fjfDhMAJecfdQRVwrw' alt='Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Capitol last week.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Closed briefings: Members of Congress raised questions about possible perfidy during closed-door briefings by military leaders, according to reporting that describes lawmakers probing the legality of the operation.</li><li>Legal framing: The Washington Post reported that officials debated after the strike whether concealing the plane’s military status crossed from deception into a potential violation of international law.</li><li>War crime claim: Firstpost described the tactic as painting over military markings to make a jet appear civilian, arguing that such disguise would be criminal under both US military law and international law if used to attack.</li><li>Media pickup: Al Jazeera said the allegation surfaced after the New York Times reported the aircraft was painted to look civilian for the operation, amplifying calls for accountability and clarification.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: Officials contend the US is in an armed conflict with suspected drug runners, a claim used to justify applying the laws of war framework to the operation.
