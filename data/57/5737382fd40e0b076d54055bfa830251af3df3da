I build hydras for common functions in my use-pattern; sometimes it&rsquo;s the C-u version that I want in my hydra. Usually this is easily done by passing a '(4) to the function. However, I have one fn that is failing at this:
(&#34;&lt;f11&gt;&#34; (lambda () (interactive) (flyspell-correct-wrapper &#39;(4))) &#34;spell correct&#34;) ;; eval: Wrong number of arguments: (0 . 0), 1 The reason for this failure is that it turns out emacs has two ways of calling fns with prefix args.
