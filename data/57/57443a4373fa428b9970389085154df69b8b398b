<p>The award is intended to &#8220;recognize those referees who stand out from among the many scholars who lend their time and expertise to comment on manuscripts submitted for consideration with <em>Philosophia</em>&#8220;, said the journal&#8217;s editor-in-chief, <a href="https://philosophy.uconn.edu/person/mitch-green/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mitchell Green</a> (University of Connecticut).</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s winner is <a href="https://www.elizabethschechter.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Schechter</a> (University of Maryland).</p>
<p>Professor Green writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Dr. Schechter’s report on the manuscript they agreed to review was exemplary for its insight, charity, and actionable suggestions for improvement offered the author. As such, their contribution was a paradigm of the kind of input from external reviewers that makes high-quality, double-blind refereed journal publication possible. </em></p>
