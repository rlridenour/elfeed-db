<p>I learned recently that CSS supports <a href="https://jvns.ca/til/css-supports-nested-selectors-now/">nested selectors</a>, but browser support still isn&rsquo;t 100%.</p>
<p>I found that <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#css">esbuild can un-nest the selectors</a>, so I added this to my deployment
script so that my CSS works for more people. (I chose the &ldquo;chrome90&rdquo; target
extremely arbitrarily)</p>
<pre><code>find . -name '*.css'
     -exec esbuild {} --target=chrome90 --outfile={} \;
</code></pre>
<p>I like that it&rsquo;s still optional so that I don&rsquo;t have to run it in development,
and if esbuild stops existing, my site will still mostly work!</p>
