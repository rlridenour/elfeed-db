<p>Bolivians voted Sunday in the country’s first presidential runoff, a contest between two conservative, pro-market candidates that ends nearly two decades of dominance by the leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) [pbs.org#1][france24.com#1][dw.com#1]. The rivals are senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira and former president Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, who both pledge to stabilize the economy and restore confidence in governance amid a prolonged crisis [nytimes.com#1][abcnews.go.com#1]. The vote is widely viewed as steering policy rightward, with expectations of a foreign policy pivot closer to the United States and a reassessment of coca cultivation and anti-drug strategy [aljazeera.com#1][straitstimes.com#1][theguardian.com#1][thehindu.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8mdBjAfqCLsw_O6gWx2KIQpNN4iPQof2hQmYYrw76tWh0gFjeu485NLpKgkZ13QIxy1iMtRQ2wysXQYzH_7ypIxfwqOftEjjloGh53kY9rE7dHF1lfm3bT30bzXRg-DstVqvF4pgDUvEc1A0zVUO1dQ5fKLn5rJVQQ_sDzKpG6tjDStMPPpowLvYNqdHwHBJBbfwWYG6lh8FskNOvYI' alt='A campaign mural in El Alto as Bolivians vote in a presidential runoff.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who’s running: The runoff pits centre-right senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira, 58, against rightwing former president Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga, 65 [theguardian.com#1].</li><li>First-round lead: Paz Pereira topped the first round in August, forcing today’s second-round vote [theguardian.com#1].</li><li>Poll momentum: In recent weeks, Quiroga overtook Paz Pereira in opinion polls heading into the runoff [theguardian.com#1].</li><li>US relations: Analysts expect a thaw with Washington after decades of frosty ties and anti-American hostility under previous governments [straitstimes.com#1][thehindu.com#1].</li><li>Coca policy: A rightward shift could revive tougher anti-drug approaches affecting coca cultivation, observers warn [theguardian.com#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Analysts on foreign policy: Observers expect a pivot toward closer engagement with the United States after years of strained relations.
