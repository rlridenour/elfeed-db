<p>Venezuela announced it has suspended energy and gas agreements with Trinidad and Tobago after a U.S. Navy destroyer arrived at the island nation&#x27;s capital, a move Caracas called a provocation and a threat to its sovereignty . Caracas said the docking, which Venezuelan leaders tied to U.S. operations against alleged drug traffickers, justified retaliatory economic steps; Trinidad&#x27;s government said joint exercises with the United States occur regularly and that hosting naval visits is routine . Analysts and reports flagged a possible economic cost to Trinidad from losing those energy ties, and the incident has further strained relations between Caracas and governments aligned with the U.S. campaign in the Caribbean .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/bzGA3wgvadhUq1CFrGdcYtMPEyln6udQZMHOvtKnYsO9SylocN9oXwsyTFYmqqxg_YmA8jMnpsenn-h_GCAynFuRLUTV8WGlWnHpZIwNYehx8rz6wCN3YTFHdL5BCDlN0H1jAEyRQ8lsxwFFvFdL6UFsiH75bc2ZHAK0GVXWSg' alt='U.S. Navy destroyer USS Gravely docked in Trinidad and Tobago amid increased regional patrols' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Warship details: The ship identified in coverage was the USS Gravely, a US Navy destroyer equipped with guided missiles, helicopters and embarked Marines, which docked in Trinidad for what US officials called joint exercises .</li><li>Alleged plot claims: Venezuelan authorities said they uncovered and disrupted what they described as a CIA-linked &#x27;false-flag&#x27; operation said to target the US warship—an accusation reported by Caracas-based and regional outlets but not corroborated by US sources in these articles .</li><li>Trinidad response: Trinidad&#x27;s government defended the visit as routine and noted that joint exercises with the United States have taken place regularly, rejecting Caracas&#x27;s characterization of the docking as an offensive move .</li><li>Economic risk: Commentators warned that suspending gas accords could raise the economic cost to Trinidad and Tobago for aligning with US operations, potentially affecting bilateral energy trade and revenues .</li></ul><blockquote>You have turned your country into an aircraft carrier of the American empire against Venezuela. - Nicolás Maduro</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Venezuela (President Nicolás Maduro): Caracas described Trinidad&#x27;s hosting of the US warship as a provocation and framed US actions in the Caribbean as a military threat to Venezuelan resources, prompting suspension of energy deals .
