<p><a class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" href="https://www.maltehendrickx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malte Hendrickx</a> (Michigan), who organizes the annual competition, says that this year it raised a total of $23,750.</p>
<p>That buys around 11,800 anti-malaria mosquito nets.</p>
<p>He also shared which philosophy departments raised the most funds:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>MIT</strong></a> took the lead early and defended the top spot valiantly, propelled by a generous donation of suspect origin: an anonymous donation of $5000 from twin earth! Organizers are unsure what this refers to, but it sure means a lot in the fight against Malaria. The other podium spots went to two veteran teams from the Philosophers Against Malaria competition: the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>University of Michigan</strong></a> and the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>University of Colorado Boulder</strong></a>.</em></p>
<p>MIT raised $11,501.75.</p>
