<p>“Patience enables us to take the right posture towards ourselves and others in our suffering and dependence.&#8221;<span id="more-52914"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s <a href="https://www.annejeffrey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anne Jeffrey</a>, associate professor of philosophy at Baylor University, and part of an interdisciplinary team of researchers on a project that recently received a $4.71 million grant from the <a href="https://templetonreligiontrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Templeton Religion Trust</a>. She adds:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em> As we consider how patience contributes to human flourishing today, the interdisciplinary approach will ground the philosophical and theological theoretical work in the lived experience of people who are no stranger to suffering, and who care well for others in their dependence and suffering.</em></p>
<p>The project is called &#8220;<a href="https://brights.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/patience-adversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patience in Adversity</a>&#8221; and it &#8220;aims to discover the dynamic processes by which patience is enacted in daily life and across the life course, ways persons and situations interact to facilitate or inhibit patience, functions of patience, and mechanisms by which people cultivate patience as a virtue.&#8221;</p>
<p>It will include a longitudinal study that will collect data from different populations who face adverse circumstances. These include parents of adolescents with disabilities, Muslim-American parents of adolescents, and parents of adolescents in a diverse sample in Southern California.</p>
