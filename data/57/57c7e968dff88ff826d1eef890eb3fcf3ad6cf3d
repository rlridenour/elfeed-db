<p>French media company Canal+ <a href="https://www.canalplusgroup.com/en/press/press-163#:~:text=CANAL+%20previews%20a%20new%20immersive%20sports%20experience">announced this week</a> that it’s working on a documentary about French motorcycle racer Johann Zarco at the French Grand Prix, which would probably not be notable for most people were it not for how it was made:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Produced in collaboration with Apple and MotoGP, a competition organized by Dorna, this new documentary event is the first Apple Immersive Video production filmed entirely with the new Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive camera. CANAL+ will be the first global studio to publish content in this exciting new storytelling format for Vision Pro.

<p>MacBreak Weekly listeners/viewers will know that we’ve been discussing the potential for Immersive Video on the Vision Pro to expand rapidly once non-Apple filmmakers have access to <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicursacine/preorder/">Blackmagic’s new Immersive camera</a>. This documentary is the first, but hopefully it is the beginning of a bigger trend.</p>
<p>I had a chance to watch the immersive teaser for this documentary, and it looked great, with a quality very much in line with other Immersive videos on the Vision Pro. I don’t know if I care a lot about the French Grand Prix, but I am a bit of a sucker for a good sports doc—and an Immersive one? Sign me up.</p>
<p>Canal+ says the documentary will be available in September.</p>
