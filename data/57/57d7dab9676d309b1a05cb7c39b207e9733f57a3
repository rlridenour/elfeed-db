<h3>Review: A Week With the iPhone 17 Pro</h3><br/>
We've now had a chance to spend some extended time with Apple's latest phones, and <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/26/iphone-17-pro-video-review/">put together his thoughts on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/30/iphone-air-two-week-review/">the ultra-thin iPhone Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>

The Pro models are showing impressive battery life gains and thermal improvements, while the upgraded front-facing camera delivers nice quality improvements for selfies. The upgraded Telephoto lens is also a welcome addition, and he's yet to see any durability issues despite some early concerns over scratches seen on demo units.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone Air is a dream to hold, and its titanium frame is beautiful and strong, but there's no hiding that the device comes with some compromises like shorter battery life and only a single rear camera.<br/>

<h3>LG UltraFine 6K (32U990A) TB5 Display: Pre-Orders Now Available</h3><br/>

The display will run you &#36;2,000, but if you think of it as an alternative to Apple's &#36;5,000+ Pro Display XDR, that pricing starts to look a lot better.<br/>
