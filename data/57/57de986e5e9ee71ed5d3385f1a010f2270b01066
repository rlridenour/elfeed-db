<p>Two philosophers at Clemson University, each in their own way, have responded to their employer&#8217;s punishment of faculty for their comments following the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.<span id="more-55076"></span></p>
<p>Clemson, acting in response to political pressure from government officials, students, and others, fired one professor and removed two others from their courses to conduct a review of their social media posts.</p>
<p>You can read an account of how this came about <a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article312132007.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.charliekurth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Kurth</a>, a professor of philosophy at the university, posted a sign on his office door:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-55077 aligncenter" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kurth-employer-morally-bankrupt.jpeg" alt="" width="619" height="400" srcset="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kurth-employer-morally-bankrupt.jpeg 1007w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kurth-employer-morally-bankrupt-300x194.jpeg 300w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kurth-employer-morally-bankrupt-768x496.jpeg 768w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kurth-employer-morally-bankrupt-400x258.jpeg 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /></p>
<p>Professor Kurth apparently is not one to waste words.</p>
<p>News of the sign went viral, with South Carolina State Representative Adam Morgan, <a href="https://x.com/RepAdamMorgan/status/1968376644206477670/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaining about it</a> to Clemson&#8217;s president via X/Twitter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, assistant professor of philosophy <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/cah/about/facultybio.html?id=31124" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Gregory</a> took to the press with <a href="https://www.thestate.com/opinion/article312151039.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an op-ed objecting to Clemson&#8217;s actions</a>. Gregory points out that Clemson&#8217;s Board of Trustees had adopted &#8220;the core principles articulated in the ‘Report of the Committee on Freedom of Expression’ at the University of Chicago&#8221; just two years ago. Gregory writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>That report is unequivocal: “It is not the proper role of the University to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive.” By its own policy, Clemson is bound to protect such speech unless it falls into narrow exceptions. The speech at issue did not. To punish it is not only constitutionally dubious but a violation of Clemson’s commitments.</em></p>
<p>Noting the various external influences that influenced Clemson&#8217;s decision, Gregory says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The danger now is permanent. Faculty have learned that job security depends on avoiding the wrath of politicians. Students have learned that the boundaries of free inquiry are drawn not in classrooms but in legislative chambers. And the public has learned that Clemson is not in charge of Clemson.</em></p>
<p>And that is a pity, as, he says, &#8220;a university exists for education, not as a political trophy.&#8221;</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/09/24/philosophers-at-clemson-defending-the-academic-freedom-of-colleagues/">Philosophers at Clemson Defend the Academic Freedom of Colleagues</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
