<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.ho-shi.co.jp/en/">Hōshi</a>, a traditional Japanese inn in Komatsu, Japan, holds the distinction of being the second oldest hotel in the world—and “the oldest still running family business in the world.”&nbsp;Built in 718 AD, Hōshi has been operated by the same family for 46 consecutive generations. Count them. 46 generations.</p>
<p>Japan is a country with deep traditions. And when you’re born into a family that’s the caretaker of a 1,300-year-old institution, you find yourself struggling with issues most of us can’t imagine. That’s particularly true when you’re the daughter of the Hōshi family, a modern woman who wants to break free from tradition. And yet history and strong family expectations keep calling her back.</p>
<p>The story of&nbsp;Hōshi Ryokan&nbsp;is poignantly told in a short documentary above. It was shot in 2014 by&nbsp;the German filmmaker&nbsp;Fritz Schumann.</p>
