In a post on Chinese social media platform Weibo today, the account Digital Chat Station <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PytwmsmJW">claimed</a> that the lowest-end iPhone 17 model will be equipped with a 6.3-inch display, up from a 6.1-inch display on the equivalent iPhone 16 model.<br/>

Digital Chat Station has more than three million followers on Weibo, and the account has accurately leaked Apple information in the past.<br/>

Last month, Counterpoint Research VP Ross Young also said that the iPhone 17 base model will be equipped with a 6.3-inch display.<br/>
