<p>Josh Marshall:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think more than anything I admired Kevin’s restraint and his
caution. Blogging is a hustle and the incentives for hyperbole and
breathlessness are endless. That makes most people easy to ignore.
But Kevin — who had a whole career in the normal-person rat race
before he started this — sweated the details. He had a serious
mind for facts and numbers and he knew how to work with data. His
posts were always overflowing with numbers and charts and levels
of detail and nitty gritty I couldn’t pile into my brain because I
was too scattered and unfocused. When he said something, you had
to take it seriously. When he disagreed with you, you knew it was
time to re-check your work. Kevin was almost all signal and very
little noise. That was his defining mark.</p>
