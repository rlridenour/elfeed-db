Intro I finally arranged my employer to purchase Mastering Emacs1, which provided it in pdf and epub. PDF2 has long since been my standard thanks to being able to view it nicely on all my devices, but I thought I would give epub a try, too. It&rsquo;s major feature sounds like both emacs-window text resizing, and page memory so it keeps track of where you&rsquo;ve read. It turns out that the lauded epub mode has some extra steps with the installation.
