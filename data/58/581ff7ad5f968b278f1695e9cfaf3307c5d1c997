<p>A <a href="https://msb.georgetown.edu/news-story/curriculum/new-georgetown-mba-curriculum-emphasizes-ai-ethics-and-career-readiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> about the changes states that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As part of the opening term, students will kick off their MBA experience with a course focused on ethical principles&#8230;. </em><em>Through the Ethical Leadership course, students participate in the “Ethics Project” – an open-ended, year-long group project with a simple prompt to </em>think of something good to do, and do it<em>. </em></p>
<p>The &#8220;Ethics Project&#8221; was originally developed by philosopher <a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RXIUAA4/jason-brennan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Brennan</a>, a professor at the McDonough School, for his business ethics course. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://msb.georgetown.edu/news-story/curriculum/making-the-case-promoting-good-work-through-the-ethics-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">description</a> of it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>To bring their ideas to life, student groups receive $1,000 in funding from private foundations and alumni, as well as what Brennan calls “radical freedom and radical responsibility for their actions.” There are few rules, but one must-do? Create something that provides good to whatever community they’re trying to serve.</em></p>
<p>In 2021, Brennan <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/06/24/brennan-wins-2-1-million-grant-to-study-markets-social-entrepreneurship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a grant</a> to expand the idea to the entire MBA class for a three-year period. What was then an experiment has now become part of the official curriculum.</p>
<p>While the curricular change is noteworthy, so is the fact that the school decided it would be good marketing to announce it. If this is a signal that ethics is good for business, that may mean more opportunities for philosophers and philosophy departments.</p>
