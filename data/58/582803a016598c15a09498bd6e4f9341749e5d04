<p>Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, 53, the son of Libya’s late leader Muammar Gaddafi and a onetime senior figure in the former regime, was killed Tuesday at his home in Zintan, western Libya, according to Libyan officials and people close to him. Authorities said they were still working to determine what led to the shooting and who was behind it. The killing comes as Libya continues to struggle to unify its institutions and hold national elections after the 2011 uprising that ended Muammar Gaddafi’s four-decade rule. Saif al-Islam largely disappeared from public life after years of captivity and legal jeopardy, then resurfaced in 2021 when he registered as a presidential candidate in a vote that later collapsed amid political deadlock.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/E14PYVqzsjJ4nJStuQt1mcq4fkkZPhmOVbmq1qHSUuXUkwm0y-Ky-iE0LKeUB5IEqGlQJq4VhImmucuKhI39fjHGdt0cqNK70tCnNdqZuOUbdzTJUjzjcZle4cinXdYVFFOxCZM7fiCIrweJ-kA1y2LX54KjGqttVvd3c7A1qDT3lqVmq0vVDs7NDEhWeH8SctZK8lywIEkBtbcYj-htoBqPzZVZR-w4Wdt3BGcHnyiYlbA6kwQicUClCWPgHyn_M7lqetN-W0hZ8Z4BnA' alt='FILE - Seif al-Islam Gadhafi speaks to media in Tripoli in 2011.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Security details: A relative told a TV channel the attackers disabled surveillance cameras before entering the home.</li><li>Prosecutor statement: Libya’s chief prosecutor’s office said he died of gunshot wounds and that investigators were pursuing leads in Zintan, without naming suspects publicly.</li><li>Lawyer account: His French lawyer, Marcel Ceccaldi, called it a commando-style operation and said he had no public information about who ordered it or why.</li><li>Legal shadow: Coverage noted that unresolved cases — including an ICC warrant and Libyan court proceedings — still hung over his attempted political return and fueled disputes over his eligibility when he sought to run in 2021.</li></ul><blockquote>He was killed today at 2pm... in Zintan in his home by a four-man commando, - Marcel Ceccaldi</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Saif al-Islam’s office: It said he was killed in a “direct confrontation” with four unknown gunmen who broke into his home.
