         
         <p>This is a simple package to automatically preview in a window the file
at point in Dired buffers. Preview windows are closed when they are no
longer relevant, while preview buffers are killed if they have not
been used for other purposes beside previewing. The package provides
several customisation options to control its behaviour.</p>

<h2>Version 0.5.0 on 2025-04-09</h2>

<p>This version contains a few bug fixes and minor refinements that
should improve the behaviour of the package.</p>

<h3>Revised how preview windows are deleted</h3>

<p>In the past, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-preview-mode</code> could delete windows that held
another buffer, thus undoing the window layout that was present before
a preview buffer was displayed. Now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-preview-mode</code> makes sure to
only delete windows that have not had another buffer shown in them,
i.e. windows that were created just for preview purposes.</p>

<h3>Directories no longer get misunderstood as “large files”</h3>

<p>We tweaked how we test the type of the buffer-to-be-preview such that
directories are not mistaken for “large files”. This was an issue for
Mac computers that Sean Devlin brought to my attention in issue 27:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/issues/27">https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/issues/27</a>.</p>

<h3>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-preview-delay</code> has a 0.1 second minimum to avoid instability</h3>

<p>A value of 0 could lead to a noticeably degraded experience while
navigating the Dired buffer. Thanks to Yiyu Zhou for reporting the
matter in issue 2 on the GitLab mirror:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/-/issues/2">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/-/issues/2</a>.</p>

<h3>Files without an extension can also be ignored</h3>

<p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-preview-ignored-extensions-regexp</code> will now
also match files without an extension, such as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.DS_Store</code> on Mac
computers.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sean Devlin for the contribution in pull request 26:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/pull/26">https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/pull/26</a>. The change is
within the ~15-line limit, meaning that Sean does not need to assign
copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<h3>The preview buffer is the “other window” for scrolling purposes</h3>

<p>The commands which scroll the other window, such as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scroll-other-window</code> now operate on the preview buffer when that is
displayed. Thanks to Karthik Chikmagalur for proposing this in issue
24: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/issues/24">https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/issues/24</a>.</p>

<p>This is in addition to the commands we already provided for scrolling
the preview window, namely, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-preview-page-up</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-preview-page-down</code>.
Do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x describe-keymap</code> and then search for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-preview-mode-map</code>:
it is in effect when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-preview-mode</code> is enabled.</p>
