Wanting to demonstrate the power of emacs M-x butterfly, I needed to make the sort of gif-screen-capture I&rsquo;ve seen others put to good work. Extra snag: I use emacs itself for a window manager, so the first online recommendation of Peek didn&rsquo;t work. Instead I found the open-source byzanz to record; however, it requires knowing the screen-portion and length of the gif beforehand. Other than that, though, it worked great even on my exwm (GUI-resistant) system.
