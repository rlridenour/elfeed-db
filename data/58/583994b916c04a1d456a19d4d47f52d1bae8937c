<em>by Renée Smith </em></h2>
<p>In 2026, the <a href="https://philosophyteachers.org/about-the-aapt/">American Association of Philosophy Teachers</a> will celebrate 50 years of advancing the art of teaching philosophy.</p>
<p>This year, I was honored to become the 24th president of the American Association of Philosophy Teachers on what marks my own 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of being involved with the AAPT. It is no exaggeration to say that the AAPT has been tremendously influential in my career as a philosophy professor.</p>
<p>In 2006, just a few years into my first job, I attended my first AAPT conference at Washington and Jefferson College. I presented research I had done and techniques I had used to teach philosophy as a distance course. While I don’t remember much about my presentation, what I do remember is the uniquely inclusive conference “vibe.” I found a community of philosophy teachers who were engaged, welcoming, and excited to talk about teaching. Every session on the program offered thoughtful and practical pedagogical strategies as well as engaging and interactive discussions relevant to my career as a philosophy teacher. Even at communal meals and social events, people were excited to talk about teaching, share their experiences, and make professional connections with other philosophy teachers no matter how long, where, or in what capacity they taught philosophy.</p>
<p>The AAPT conferences, and the many other AAPT activities I have since experienced, unlike any other professional activities, have been foundational to the professional life I have developed over the last 20 years as a philosophy professor. Because of the AAPT, I have attended, presented, and planned conferences sessions, published papers, co-edited a volume of <em>AAPT Studies in Pedagogy</em>, refereed conference and journal submissions, supported colleagues’ bids for promotion, mentored faculty, organized virtual conferences, facilitated virtual teaching discussions, and performed professional service on committees and on the board of the AAPT.</p>
<p>In the coming year, as we prepare to celebrate the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of AAPT in 2026, I invite you to get involved with the AAPT, to discover the many activities and resources the AAPT has to offer, and to join us at our summer conference in July 22-26, 2026, at Eastern Michigan University!</p>
<p>In support of philosophy pedagogy and philosophy teachers, the AAPT offers an array of activities, events, and opportunities designed by and for philosophy teachers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The AAPT hosts a biennial, <em><a href="https://philosophyteachers.org/conference/">four-day conference-workshop</a></em> in the summer of even-numbered years. Numerous concurrent session on a variety of topics related to teaching philosophy provide opportunities to try teaching techniques and activities, present scholarly work on teaching, and engage with other philosophy teachers. Many attendees stay on campus and eat meals together, participate in Trivia Night, and enjoy the conference banquet. The call for proposals for our 2026 conference workshop is <a href="https://philosophyteachers.org/cfp-2026-conference/">here</a>.</li>
