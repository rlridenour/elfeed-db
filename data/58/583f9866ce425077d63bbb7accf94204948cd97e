<p>You know what, I like that I&rsquo;m bald. I can always joke with other folks at work (&ldquo;Are you sure you want to make this a <em>regular</em> meeting? You&rsquo;ll end up like me!&rdquo; - at which point I point my head and get a laugh or two).</p>
<p>If there was any period in my life when someone judged me for being bald (say, a potential date) then screw it, I didn&rsquo;t need them anyway. It&rsquo;s a low-level &ldquo;no shitty people&rdquo; filter in that regard, kind of like being short (which is another thing).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://taonaw.com/2023/03/09/keeping-bald.html">easy to take care of and it&rsquo;s cheap</a>. It&rsquo;s cooler in the summer, but easy enough to warm up in the winter (I love beanies and hoodies). My nieces love petting my head after I shave it, a way of saying hello to Uncle JTR. I think it makes the beard and mustache stand out more, and when I wear my leather jacket, it makes me a bit more of a badass on the outside (on the inside I&rsquo;m always nice of course)</p>
<p>I think I started balding in my 20s, after the army. My mom was worried and took me to a &ldquo;hair doctor,&rdquo; who showed me diagrams of how I would look in a year, 3 years, 5 years&hellip; I looked, and I remember I just didn&rsquo;t care, something I guess he wasn&rsquo;t really used to. Just a part of me that I always accepted.</p>
