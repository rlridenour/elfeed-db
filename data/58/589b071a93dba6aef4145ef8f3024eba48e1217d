<p>Nathan Gill, a former Reform UK leader in Wales and ex-MEP, was sentenced on Friday to 10.5 years in prison after pleading guilty to eight counts of bribery for accepting payments to make pro-Russia statements in the European Parliament between December 2018 and July 2019 [nytimes#1][scmp#1][abc.net.au#1]. Police estimated he took at least £40,000 in bribes, and prosecutors said the payments led to scripted public statements and media appearances [scmp#1][lemonde#1]. The case has prompted calls from Prime Minister Keir Starmer for Nigel Farage to investigate and root out any links between Reform UK and Russia, further testing Farage’s stance on Moscow [theguardian#2][theguardian#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/CWaE6Gm5FwEiY4kqC_zThqtY5XHTZDOUg0sIfPF1MM4i7mg4FcU8NRm1byB5iKPLo-Ns-Mg8LPvDppz5LorTzZdjN3-kZ87LTM3nPC-s1MoIOfjybhErYT3uCv47SUF5maWLOWW4CaMGGgY5i7fu5WE58mmmdeZDQcK48MV36YJ0Neibg_WeonnQTNRa93UdoZyQrLsKKByKyBZhL4Mh8OffjvU' alt='Nathan Gill arriving for sentencing at the Old Bailey court in London.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Sentence details: Gill received 10 years and six months after admitting eight bribery offenses tied to pro-Russia statements [nytimes#1][scmp#1].</li><li>Money and timeframe: Police estimated he accepted at least £40,000 between December 2018 and July 2019 to make favorable remarks about Russia [scmp#1].</li><li>Political background: Gill was elected to the European Parliament in 2014 for UKIP and later represented the Brexit Party; he also led Reform UK in Wales [euronews#1][aljazeera#1].</li><li>Court’s view: The sentencing judge said Gill had “abused position of authority and trust,” underscoring the seriousness of the offenses [aljazeera#1].</li><li>Political fallout: Keir Starmer said Farage had questions to answer and urged Reform UK to investigate and root out any Russia links, amid wider scrutiny of Farage’s stance on Moscow [theguardian#2][theguardian#1].</li><li>What he did: Prosecutors said the bribes led to scripted statements and TV appearances promoting pro-Russia narratives, including in the European Parliament [lemonde#1][ft#1][nytimes#1].</li></ul><blockquote>abused position of authority and trust - Sentencing judge</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Keir Starmer: Called on Nigel Farage to investigate and root out any links between Reform UK and Russia, saying Farage has questions to answer [theguardian#2].
