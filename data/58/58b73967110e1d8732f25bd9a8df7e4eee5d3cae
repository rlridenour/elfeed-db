<p id="p1">I <em>love</em> my iPad Pro, but, as you know, lately <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/ipados-26-2-beta-restores-drag-and-drop-gestures-for-split-view-and-slide-over/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I&rsquo;ve been wondering</a> about what comes after <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-26-the-macstories-review/9/#ipados" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPadOS 26</a>. We have much better multitasking now, and key workflow limitations such as file management, audio recording, and long-running background tasks have been addressed by Apple this year. But now that the user-facing system&rsquo;s foundation has been &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;, what about the app ecosystem?</p>
<p id="p2">Over at Snazzy Labs, Quinn Nelson has been wondering the same, and I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnYLpA5kAbo" rel="noopener noreferrer">watching his video</a>:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper" id="div3"><iframe loading="lazy" title="The iPad's Software Problem Is Permanent" width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bnYLpA5kAbo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p id="p4">Quinn makes a series of strong, cogent arguments with factual evidence that show how, <em>despite</em> multitasking and other iPadOS 26 improvements, using apps on an iPad Pro often falls short of what can be achieved with the <em>same</em> apps on a Mac. There is so much I could quote from this video, but I think his final thought sums it up best:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  There are still days that I reach for my $750 MacBook Air because my $2,000 iPad Pro can&rsquo;t do what I need it to. Seldom is the reverse true.

<p id="p6">I&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/ipados-26-2-beta-restores-drag-and-drop-gestures-for-split-view-and-slide-over/" rel="noopener noreferrer">so happy</a> that Apple seems to be taking iPadOS more seriously than ever this year. But now I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if the iPad&rsquo;s problems run deeper than windowing when it comes to getting serious work done on it.</p>
