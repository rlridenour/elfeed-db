<p>Large demonstrations took place in Nuuk, Greenland, and in Copenhagen, Denmark, opposing President Trump’s stated push for the United States to take control of Greenland, a self-governing territory in the Danish realm. Organizers and participants framed the marches as a defense of Greenlandic self-determination, using slogans such as “Greenland is not for sale” and emphasizing that Greenlanders should decide their own future. President Trump has argued the US needs Greenland for “national security,” and reports say he has coupled the issue with tariff threats aimed at European countries opposing US control of the island. The protests were described as unusually large for Greenland, with officials calling them the biggest ever staged in the country—a notable sign of civic engagement in a small population.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Ps_2L-k1FZzVb71Muf6vrHeOQD0f72rZVjEjaPR_RjWb5BaNAFT-EjP5wK1MJv9zdgtDz0O2bUHph8vDLYn4bjzNwactlXEI4tOHpFJlkcvFrK1o7PKaa2FeGRsNl2MQRPfK9LsvJVGpfa-Ml_VuoISOcHer3VnxBQPUt1PWOye7ueKR-i6ei3bCgoLa1334NjHAceJaHFddeQyTeIMOiFR4p4YzGH46VSP6V89x213zWuCuNHvAab-6trt7V6yUadqbJiEn4SZQQwDbCw' alt='Demonstrators gather in Nuuk, Greenland to protest against the United States&#x27; threats to annex Greenland on Sat.
