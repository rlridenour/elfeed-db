<p>Having read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/opinion/sunday/are-you-in-despair-thats-good.html">Are You in Despair? That’s Good</a>, I was encouraged to expand my emotional vocabulary. As a <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el">zone.el</a> fan (checkout <a href="https://github.com/wasamasa/zone-nyan">nyan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kawabata/zone-sl">sl</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/kawabata/zone-rainbow">rainbow</a>), I looked into writing a zone <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el#L52">program</a>. When <em>zone-when-idle</em> is set, zone acts as a screensaver of sorts. We can use this to display random emotional vocab whenever Emacs is idle for a period of time. Let's get to it…</p>
<p>Zone keeps a list of programs to choose from when kicked off. Below is a basic <em>zone-hello</em> program, along with an interactive command for previewing. Not much to these. The tiny program prepares the screen for zoning and inserts text while no input is pending.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(defun zone-hello ()
  (delete-other-windows)
  (setq mode-line-format nil)
  (zone-fill-out-screen (window-width) (window-height))
  (delete-region (point-min) (point-max))
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (while (not (input-pending-p))
    (insert &quot;hello zone\n&quot;)
    (zone-park/sit-for (point-min) 0.2)))

(defun zone-hello-preview ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((zone-programs [zone-hello]))
    (zone)))
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what <em>zone-hello</em> looks like:</p>

<p>Back to improving our emotional vocabulary, we'll need a dictionary for our goal. A quick search yields a potential list of <a href="http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/assess/feelings.html">words</a>. We can use <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> to define them while offline. These two sources will do for now. We tie it all together in <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/ar/zone-words.el">zone-words.el</a> and the resulting zone program looks as follow:</p>

<p>UPDATE: Just came across <a href="http://blog.josephwilk.net/art/emacs-animation.html">Animations With Emacs</a>. A post with awesome zone examples.</p>
