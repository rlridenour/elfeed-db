All upcoming iPhone 17 models will come equipped with 12GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence, according to the Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PpvMic2B5">Digital Chat Station</a>. <br/>

The claim from the Chinese leaker, who has sources within Apple's supply chain, comes a few days after industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-12gb-ram-rumor/">all be equipped with 12GB of RAM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo also said even the base-model iPhone 17 could be equipped with 12GB of RAM, but it will depend on whether supply chain shortages can be overcome. He said that Apple will make a final decision on the amount of RAM it will offer in the regular iPhone 17 model by May. Even if the base-model iPhone 17 sticks with 8GB of RAM, Kuo said he expects all models in next year's iPhone 18 lineup to have 12GB of RAM.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/all-iphone-16-models-have-8gb-ram/">all iPhone 16 models come with 8GB of RAM</a>, so going to 12GB would be a major increase. More RAM enables larger and more capable AI models to run locally, improving the speed, responsiveness, and complexity of tasks without relying heavily on cloud services. A fifty percent increase in allocable RAM would also allow for smoother multitasking, with AI processes operating in the background without slowing down active apps. <br/>

Apple is expected to release the iPhone 17 lineup around its usual September timeframe. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/29/all-iphone-17-models-feature-12gb-of-ram/">All iPhone 17 Models Again Rumored to Feature 12GB of RAM</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-iphone-17-models-again-rumored-to-feature-12gb-of-ram.2456153/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
