<li>Whole lot of forks and knives and spoons and stuff</li>
<li>Buy a backup set for when you lose some</li>
<li>And then buy another backup set for when you lose some of those</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: Yes, but only with a lot of effort</li>
</ul><h1>Utensil Refresh</h1><p>Last time we sold these, <a href="/@dpease">@dpease</a> made a suggestion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looks like a pretty good deal. Just a reminder, if you want this for your silverware set buy an extra for ready replenishment of the forks and spoons that mysteriously disappear over the years. I wish I had done that when I bought my silverware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we’ll say, forks and knives and spoons don’t disappear with the same frequency as socks, per se. But they do have a way of sneaking off. You bring one to work. Or you take a few on a picnic. Or you simply have children. Or whatever.</p>
<p>It really doesn’t matter the reason. What’s important is, next thing you know, you’ve gotta hand-wash the forks after every meal–breakfast, lunch, and dinner–because there’s only one per person in your household.</p>
<p>So, definitely buy one set and another set as a backup.</p>
<p>And then… maybe another set after that? To be a backup to the second set?</p>
<p>In response to dpease’s suggestion, <a href="/@goldnectar">@goldnectar</a> joked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think you’d gag if you saw my utensils drawer. I think there is a set in there somewhere under all the randoms that accumulated over decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we’ve talked about this phenomenon before. Unlike electronics, some products keep “working” almost indefinitely, leading you to believe you shouldn’t replace them, even when they’re a mess.</p>
<p>Our chief example of this in the past has been the backpack. It gets scuffed, some threads get loose, it gets a few stains that simply won’t come out, it looks disgusting, it smells sorta bad, and the zipper catches a little in that one spot… BUT! It can still hold stuff, so why get a new one?</p>
<p>Utensils are an even better illustration, though, because they can outlast a backpack by centuries.</p>
<p>And I’m speaking from experience, by the way. I’ve got a couple ancient coffee spoons and dessert forks that are absolutely mangled by trips down into the garbage disposal. The surface scratched, the tines way out of line.</p>
<p>And yet, I say to myself, “Why get rid of those? They can stir coffee or stab some cake.”</p>
<p>So I keep them.</p>
<p>But I don’t have to. And neither does goldnectar. And neither do you.</p>
<p>Because we sell sets like these for prices like this. So we can all just throw away the contents of our utensil drawer and start over.</p>
<p>And then start over again. With the backup set. Like dpease suggested.</p>
<p>In conclusion: buy some flatware.</p>
