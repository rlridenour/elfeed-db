With the new feature, approved &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; users can use Affirm to opt to split eligible in-person purchases into biweekly or monthly payments from 0% APR to 36% APR.<br/>
<br/>
Those that choose Klarna in the U.S. can use Pay in 4 to split the cost into four interest-free installments, Pay Later to pay the full amount up to 30 days later with no interest, or Financing with monthly installments for larger purchases. In the UK, Klarna supports Pay in 3 and Pay Later.<br/>
<br/>
Affirm and Klarna's pay-over-time options were already available for online purchases made using &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, but now purchases made in retail locations can also use the split payment functionality. For a short period of time, Apple offered its own &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later service, but it was discontinued in favor of partnerships with other companies.<br/>
