<p>Just run this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>composer install --ignore-platform-req<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>php
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="issue">Issue</h2>
<p>I often have an issue when after upgrading PHP to a newer versions I can&rsquo;t do <code>composer install</code>
anymore because one or more libraries haven&rsquo;t updated their <code>require.php</code> section to support
newer version of the language.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if you manage to install new versions of those libs you still may have other
projects on your machine that require older version of php (my case).</p>
<p>I also prefer to have programming languages installed on my machine directly without any docker stuff that would potentially solve this issue. Also I&rsquo;m not aware of any solutions like NVM or RVM for PHP.</p>
