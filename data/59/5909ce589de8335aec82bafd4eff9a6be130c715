After <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/15/apple-releases-ios-26/">releasing iOS 26 today</a>, Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/os/pdf/All_New_Features_iOS_26_Sept_2025.pdf">shared a list of nearly 200 changes</a> included in the software update, ranging from new features to minor tweaks.<br/>

Keep in mind that 200 changes does not mean 200 new features. The list contains even the smallest of changes across the operating system and Apple's built-in apps.<br/>
<br/>
The vast majority of the changes in the list have already received lots of attention. Here are a few small changes that went somewhat under the radar:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>eSIM Quick Transfer now requires Face ID or Touch ID, with no passcode fallback, when Stolen Device Protection is active.</li><br/>
<li>In the Messages app, there is now a Drafts folder/filter.</li><br/>
<li>In the Podcasts app, there are more listening speeds, ranging from 0.5x to 3x. You can save your preferred speed per podcast.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
