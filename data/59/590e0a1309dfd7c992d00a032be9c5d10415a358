Here's how Apple's AirPods offering looks like now:<br/>
<ul><li>AirPods 4 – &#36;129</li><br/>
<li>AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancelation – &#36;179</li><br/>
<li>AirPods Pro 3 – &#36;249</li><br/>
<li>AirPods Max – &#36;549</li></ul>AirPods Pro 3 have the same &#36;249 price tag as the previous generation model, so users will be getting several new features and enhancements for the same outlay.<br/>
<br/>
These include up to 2x better Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), up to 8 hours of listening time with ANC on a single charge, a new design, built-in heart rate sensing, foam-infused ear tips, Live Translation, and more.<br/>

Apple has started accepting pre-orders for AirPods Pro 3. The new devices will be delivered to customers starting on Friday, September 19. Will you be getting a pair?
