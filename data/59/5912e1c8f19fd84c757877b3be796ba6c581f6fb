<p>I created a new wiki file specifically for Micro.blog. If this is to go anywhere, the first thing I need to do is to separate it from my existing wiki. From my first Journal entry there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I decided to start a new Wiki for Micro.blog. The existing Wiki I have, The Art of Not Asking How (TAONAH), is filled with personal interests and topics that have nothing to do with the task at hand, as well as settings and customizations that fit my needs there, but might not work best in this wiki.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first adjustment I made (besides changing the name of this wiki and its subheading) was to add a Journal button so I can create tiddlers like this one to explain the recent changes. This is similar to the CaptianLog in TAONAH, and will serve a similar purpose: writing down recent changes and explaining why they were made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the wiki is self-contained (all the text, macros, and other moving parts are contained in the wiki&rsquo;s single HTML file; the only other files are images for tiddlers which will be stored in a separate folder), it makes sense it will have its on log file, a &ldquo;readme.txt&rdquo; of sorts which will explain the recent changes made and why. I hope this will help reviewers and contributors in the future.</p>
