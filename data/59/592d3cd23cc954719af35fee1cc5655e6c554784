<div>  <p>One piece of programming advice is that one shouldn't use numbers in code unless they're <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3518938/what-are-magic-numbers-in-computer-programming">stored in a variable or constant</a>. Using a number as a bare value &ndash; often called a "magic number" &ndash; gives no context as to why that number is being used.</p>  <pre><code class="code-java">totalWidth = getSize() + 272;</code></pre>  <p>Why <code>272</code>? Why not <code>113</code>? Instead, one is encouraged to use constants.</p>  <pre><code class="code-java">final int WINDOW_PADDING = 272;totalWidth = getSize() + WINDOW_PADDING;</code></pre>  <p>This is better, because it prevents typos. But simply using a constant doesn't ensure readability. In string variables, there's an antipattern I'm calling <em>magic strings</em>.</p>  <pre><code class="code-java">final String USE_FOOBAR_SYSTEM = "use_foobar_system";</code></pre>  <p>While the value is stored in a variable, the variable name merely repeats this value. The name doesn't help the reader understand what it's there for. These variables are no better than a numeric constant like:</p>  <pre><code class="code-java">final int THREE_HUNDRED_SEVENTY_TWO = 372;</code></pre>  <p>The code does use a constant, but its name doesn't explain <em>why</em> the constant is there. Better to give it a name that explains what it's used for.</p>  <pre><code class="code-java">final String FOOBAR_SYSTEM_FEATURE_FLAG_NAME = "use_foobar_system";</code></pre>  <p>This way, the name alone clearly indicates what it's used for. And clarity is a great goal to have in programming. As Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-7.html">have said</a>,</p>  <figure>    <blockquote>      <p>&hellip;programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</p>    </blockquote>  </figure></div>
