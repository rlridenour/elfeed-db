<p>The UK government says China has lifted its sanctions on serving British lawmakers and peers, a step Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer linked to his meeting with President Xi Jinping during Starmer’s China visit. Starmer said he raised the issue directly and was told the restrictions “no longer apply,” adding that Xi indicated parliamentarians would be welcome to visit China. The move comes as London seeks a warmer, more “sophisticated” relationship with Beijing and as Starmer’s delegation—reported to include more than 50 business leaders and dozens of companies—pursues trade and investment discussions in Beijing and Shanghai. Alongside the sanctions shift, the visit also produced agreements and understandings spanning visas and economic cooperation areas such as services, healthcare, green tech and finance, as both sides look for pragmatic areas to work on even as long-running concerns remain part of the wider relationship.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/70_wOCw4_c4s_klw5wq8xCHtm42sFlaPG7uHre7iQcBcZKIyypFuT4uJXcZpHDakxq1oElYXBa7cBeCTHA8JqkM2cqxUXb0WRzbHS3d3iLJym1TYsoASMgqgYoiIIFwI9gbpRTcszHeFeH0' alt='UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets China’s President Xi Jinping during Starmer’s China visit.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who was targeted: The individuals originally sanctioned in 2021 were among those who highlighted alleged human rights violations against Uyghur Muslims, with The Guardian reporting nine UK citizens were banned at the time.</li><li>No quid pro quo: UK officials stressed there was no “quid pro quo” for China’s move to remove the restrictions on parliamentarians.</li><li>Trade sweeteners: POLITICO reported Starmer’s trip coincided with China offering visa-free travel for British citizens for up to 30 days and a reduction in Chinese tariffs on Scotch whisky, though it noted many details remained unclear.</li><li>Business delegation: Starmer brought a sizable commercial contingent—reported as 54 companies by SCMP and more than 50 business leaders by The Hindu—with events in Shanghai including receptions and a business forum aimed at signing further deals.</li><li>Cooperation areas: The BBC said the visit produced agreements covering services, healthcare, green technology and finance, suggesting both governments are looking to expand practical cooperation beyond headline diplomacy.</li></ul><blockquote>And the response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit - Keir Starmer</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>UK government (Keir Starmer): Starmer said he raised the sanctions issue with Xi and was told the restrictions no longer apply, with parliamentarians welcome to visit.
