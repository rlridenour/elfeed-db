<p>Lot&rsquo;s of worries about what&rsquo;s going on in Israel and also here, which is not rare for me, but it doesn&rsquo;t happen often either on the other hand.</p>
<p>In what is dubbed by the IDF &ldquo;עם כלביא&rdquo; (a rough translation is &ldquo;people as lion&rdquo;) operation, Israel was hit with large ballistic missiles that cause severe damage (compared to the rockets from Hamas, those can be considered &ldquo;minor&rdquo;), leveling a whole block with one hit. A few of these missiles hit, causing hundreds of wounded. My father is somewhere in the middle of all of that, sleeping and going to work. So is my aunt, and my other aunt, and my cousin, and the rest of the people I know in Israel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here in the US, the &ldquo;No Kings&rdquo; protests are spreading beyond LA into large cities, as expected. This time though it coincides with the tomato in chief&rsquo;s (TIC from now on) stupid display of dictatorship, an event that came to be because of his birthday and the 250th birthday of the US military. It&rsquo;s not an official display of dictatorship, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be. For the many who protest, this is what it is, and this is probably one of the reasons TIC&rsquo;s going with it.</p>
<p>The other issue is the initial reason for the demonstrations this time - ICE&rsquo;s actions against immigrants (not even illegal immigrants, as they capture legal ones too). How long will it be before a police officer somewhere or a soldier refuses to follow orders to arrest someone they know or stand up against what they believe in?  Immigration is a big part of this country, and dividing it into &ldquo;legals&rdquo; and &ldquo;illegals&rdquo; is not a simple matter.</p>
<p>Only a year ago, I watched <a href="https://taonaw.com/2024/06/16/civil-war.html">Civil War</a>, and I voiced some concerns there. This country is slowly getting ripe for a war like that, and events like these pack up metaphorical explosive barrels in large cities. When there&rsquo;s enough explosives, and I think we&rsquo;re heading there, all it needs is a spark of stupidity&hellip; and as we can have plenty of those with TIC.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the worry toward my Jewish colleagues and friends who reach out to me with their own concerns. They are checking in on me, knowing I have family in Israel, but I know that their concern for me is mutual, and they are worried too. There are enough financial concerns in our organization and insecurity about our jobs already, which is doubled by the &ldquo;help&rdquo; he provides through this crackpot anti-semitic force, yet another attempt to grab control under the disguise of concern.</p>
<p>My apartment here is quiet. I hear the sound of raindrops on wet leaves and birds tweeting here and there. A chill, lazy Sunday. I had my coffee, and I want to make time and write about my technological adventures, but my brain is stuck elsewhere - and it&rsquo;s OK. Sometimes, that&rsquo;s all you can do.</p>
