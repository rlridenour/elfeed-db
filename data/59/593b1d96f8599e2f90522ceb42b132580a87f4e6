<p>On Sunday, President Trump called Colombian President Gustavo Petro an &quot;illegal drug leader&quot; and said the United States would stop &quot;large scale payments and subsidies&quot; to Colombia, though it was not immediately clear which funds he meant [reuters.com#1][pbs.org#1][bbc.com#1][theguardian.com#1]. The move follows a sharp diplomatic spat after Petro accused Washington of violating Colombia’s sovereignty and committing &quot;murder&quot; during a recent U.S. strike in Caribbean waters that Bogotá says killed a Colombian fisherman [france24.com#2][scmp.com#2][lemonde.fr#1]. The U.S. military has targeted multiple vessels in the Caribbean in recent weeks as part of anti-trafficking operations, and two survivors from a Thursday strike will be returned to Colombia and Ecuador for prosecution in their home countries, according to Trump [bbc.com#1][allsides.com#1][straitstimes.com#2]. Ties have been strained recently, including the U.S. revoking Petro’s visa last month after he joined a pro-Palestinian demonstration in New York and urged U.S. soldiers to disobey orders; in September, Trump also designated Colombia among countries that &quot;failed demonstrably&quot; to meet counternarcotics obligations [reuters.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/iPzle310dHf6nasCI3mtI3DueLzF0QVCMmHke2Yc5clTQP0oCwZQlXqnPWK1ZkGhozMi--ZCjaIcE4yosIvFxQgCCCQIsafShTIwfhGRZQJZMnax6HmtEOOuRudZDwpNqS4G0IuPc7YjYNPi9etmNGgTuuK_6QaXzDWuMGY7hGvMuIdHWfgZXygQh5_Urqs21clAWwSvsrkfRySXEWH_xKlGeuCW2RuSXg0mbT2lbc8pS0olb1MfSoI' alt='President Donald Trump announced an immediate halt to U.S. payments to Colombia.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Caribbean campaign: U.S. forces have struck at least six ships in the Caribbean in recent weeks as part of anti-trafficking operations [bbc.com#1].</li><li>Legal handling: Repatriating the two survivors to Colombia and Ecuador avoids complex questions about U.S. military detention for suspected traffickers, legal experts say [allsides.com#1].</li><li>Coca strategy: Petro’s 2024 plan to pacify coca-growing regions with social and military measures has yielded limited success, according to reporting cited by U.S. officials [reuters.com#1].</li><li>Trump’s warning: Trump’s post warned Petro to “close up” drug operations or the U.S. would do it “not nicely” [theglobeandmail.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE, - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: Argues Colombia has &quot;failed demonstrably&quot; on counternarcotics and says U.S. payments are a &quot;rip-off&quot; that will end immediately.
