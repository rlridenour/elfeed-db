The &#36;60 Powerstation Wireless Slim has an ultra-thin design that's meant to provide extra power without adding too much bulk. It has a 5,000 mAh battery and also includes a 20W USB-C power delivery port for wired charging. It's just 9mm thick, so it pairs well with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> or any of Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
Mophie also has a version of the Slim with a built-in stand that is able to rotate 180 degrees, making it ideal for watching videos in either portrait or landscape mode. It is priced at &#36;70, and is 11mm thick to accommodate the stand.<br/>
<br/>
The &#36;80 Powerstation Wireless has a larger 10,000 mAh capacity, but a thicker design than the slim model at 15mm. It too includes a 20W USB-C port for faster wired charging. The &#36;90 Powerstation Wireless with Stand is 2mm thicker, coming in at 17mm, plus it supports 30W wired charging.<br/>
