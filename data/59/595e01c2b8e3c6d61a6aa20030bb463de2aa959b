The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> and macOS 26 updates could bring several new features to the AirPods, including sleep detection features and camera control options, reports <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/04/exclusive-airpods-ios-26-wwdc-features/">9to5Mac</a></em>. The AirPods features would be introduced through firmware updates that would accompany Apple's new software.<br/>

Here's what's rumored:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>New head gestures</strong> - Apple could add new head gestures, such as a gesture for adjusting the volume of Conversation Awareness. Last year, Apple added a nod and a head shake to answer or decline calls.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Auto-pause for sleep</strong> - The AirPods could pause audio when the wearer falls asleep, presumably using sleep data gleaned from the Apple Watch, as the AirPods have no sleep detection functionality.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Camera trigger</strong> - Apple is planning to add trigger functionality to the AirPods, capturing an image on a linked <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a press on the AirPods stem. It's possible this might work with a timer so the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user isn't touching an ear when the photo is taken.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Microphone enhancement</strong> - AirPods could get a "studio quality" microphone mode that's similar to the Audio Mix feature on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that lets users choose from sound recording options like studio and cinematic.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Better pairing</strong> - Apple is apparently working on a feature that would improve how AirPods pair with shared iPads for use in the classroom.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
It is not clear if these rumored features would work across all AirPods models or if some features might be limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>. <em>9to5Mac</em> warns that Apple could "choose to delay or tweak" the AirPods features before they are announced.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also expected to introduce a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/airpods-live-translation-ios-19/">live translate feature</a> for the AirPods, which would translate in-person conversations from one language to another.<br/>

Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> keynote kicks off on Monday, June 9, and Apple plans to unveil &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and macOS 26. That's where we're likely to hear additional details about any new AirPods functionality that's coming alongside the software updates.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/ios-26-airpods-rumors/">iOS 26 Could Bring Sleep Detection, Camera Controls, and New Gestures to AirPods</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-could-bring-sleep-detection-camera-controls-and-new-gestures-to-airpods.2458194/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
