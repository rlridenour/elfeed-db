<p><a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/barryl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barry Lam</a> (UC Riverside) <a href="https://hiphination.substack.com/p/calling-dibs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> recently about the practice of &#8220;calling dibs.&#8221;<span id="more-56135"></span></p>
<p>In case you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the practice, Lam describes it and provides some examples:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Calling “dibs” is a very pervasive social phenomenon. In Boston, Chicago, and other snowy regions, you have dibs on a parking spot you dug out during a blizzard. You have dibs on items you put in your shopping cart at the supermarket before you pay for them. You have dibs when you have items placed on layaway at a store. If you put your sweater down on a chair at Starbucks and then get in line, you have dibs on the seat. Children have dibs on the driver’s seat when they “call shotgun.” Dibs is a cool little sublegal, informal practice of making a claim to some property you do not own and you do not otherwise have a right to use, but by merely doing some kind of conventional gesture, you thereby generate some kind of norm of exclusion; now other people have some kind of standing obligation not to interfere with your use of the item. Dibs is staking a property claim without thereby having the claim. Having dibs is being in an in-between state between having and not having a property right, and dibs is something no one believes ought to be elevated to the status of law and legal enforcement. Someone is definitely doing something wrong by taking items out of your shopping cart, but they aren’t stealing from you, nor from the store. Neither is parking in the spot you dug out, or moving your sweater to take your Starbucks seat. But they are definitely violating a norm.</em></p>
<p>He then goes on to suggest some philosophy of dibs:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Calling dibs and having dibs looks to me like a classic phenomenon admitting of conceptual analysis. Its the kind of phenomenon that admits of boundaries we all deploy without thinking about. We intuitively know when someone successfully calls dibs and when they have not (the felicity conditions on a speech act, as J.L. Austin named it). Relative to a community, we intuitively know the kind of things we are allowed to call dibs on, and things we aren’t. We all know where dibs end and ownership begins, and we instinctively have a sense about when dibs run out over time.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://hiphination.substack.com/p/calling-dibs">rest of his piece, here,</a> explores the concept, and is worth checking out. It got me wondering about dibs in philosophy.</p>

What are the means by which one calls said dibs? What does calling dibs entitle one to? When one calls philosophical dibs, for whom is this call normative? How local is the normativity of dibs?</p>
<p>I think there is a practice in philosophy of calling dibs. To see this, consider the following scenario:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You give a talk in which you lay out a novel argument. Soon afterwards, before you are able to get your idea published in an academic venue, someone who was in the audience for that talk&#8212;let&#8217;s call him Bogartistotle&#8212;writes an article about your argument in which he explains it, critiques it, and strengthens it, and he gets the article published. Bogartistotle credits you with the argument, but his article preempts yours, rendering your unpublished manuscript otiose.</p>
<p>Not everyone will agree with this (of course), but it seems that Bogartistotle acted improperly, and that the concept of calling dibs can help explain why. Your giving of the talk was your calling dibs on its argument. That calling of dibs on the argument entitles you to some forbearance by others in publishing work about your argument. Which others? At least those who were at the talk, including Bogartistotle. As with other dibs, the claims philosophy dibs generate are not indefinitely normative; after some time, absent further dibs-calling activity, they expire. If Bogartistotle had instead written and published his article five years after your talk, during which time you had not written or worked on it further, that wouldn&#8217;t have seemed improper: your dibs died. But he didn&#8217;t wait. And that&#8217;s not quite right.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite right, but it is also not like other wrongs in the vicinity. Bogartistotle didn&#8217;t steal your idea in any strong sense, or distort the intellectual record, as a plagiarist does. After all, he explicitly credits you with the argument he is writing about. And though some people might disapprove of what Bogartistotle did once they learn of it, as with other dibs-violations, there is no institution entitled to take corrective or punitive action against him for it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, like other dibs, there is some vagueness about the dibs called when giving a talk. Whom do calling these dibs generate claims against? I said &#8220;at least&#8221; those in the audience of the talk, but who else? There&#8217;s also vagueness about the duration of dibs. And there&#8217;s vagueness about the discount rate of its entitlements (i.e., over time, do the dibs get gradually less demanding in what they ask of others, or are their demands about the same throughout their existence until they expire?). I&#8217;m not sure of the feasibility or desirability of clearing these vaguenesses up. (Though see this attempt at laying out <a href="https://www.shotgunrules.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shotgun rules</a>, as well as this account of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5BZvV1ZTyE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disagreement over dibs</a>.)</p>
<p>Some might say that a referee would be unlikely to recommend Bogartistotle&#8217;s article (as I described it) for publication, or that an editor would be unlikely to accept it for publication. If that&#8217;s so, it would probably in part be explained by the referee or editor&#8217;s sense that the article is a kind of dibs-violation with which they do not wish to be complicit.</p>
<p>So I think presenting a novel idea or argument in a talk is a type of calling dibs we have in philosophy. There are probably others; feel free to share them, or other informal norms in the profession that are not too distant from calling dibs.
