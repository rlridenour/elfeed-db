<p>The ACLU:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taking photographs and video of things that are plainly visible in
public spaces is a constitutional right — and that includes
police and other government officials carrying out their duties.</p>

<p>However, there is a widespread, continuing pattern of law
enforcement officers ordering people to stop taking photographs or
video in public places and harassing, detaining, and arresting
those who fail to comply.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights#i-want-to-take-pictures-or-shoot-video-at-a-protest">Here’s their advice</a> on what to say and do if you are stopped or detained for taking photographs or video.</p>

<p>Also, as good a time as ever for one of my periodic reminders to remember <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/06/require_a_passcode_to_unlock_your_iphone">how to hard-lock your iPhone to temporarily disable Face ID</a>: press and hold the side button and either one of the volume buttons at the same time for a few seconds.</p>
