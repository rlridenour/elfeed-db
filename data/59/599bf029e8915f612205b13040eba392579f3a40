<p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague has opened three weeks of hearings to examine allegations that Myanmar committed genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority during a 2017 military crackdown. The case was brought by The Gambia and asks the UN’s top court to determine whether Myanmar breached the Genocide Convention, an unusually high-profile effort by a small state to seek accountability through international law. Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh are watching closely, hoping the proceedings keep global attention on their situation and move the long-running search for justice forward.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/MXwz20L47f3Cfh3bzfsXaF3cmEKjfSouyZ0n3cqdhhSKjZVIzvV3qxWHiZv68gMRykxRKWM4Q8eZDGwHDQ1AsyU--968QjYs4CEVbdewLhJd-NjUFgVKnDasriYj_TJJuO7Ipi8X2HRiUYTs3Re2Sex6b_J-RC0Z6GxcsNe7CQ' alt='International Court of Justice proceedings in The Hague as hearings open in the Rohingya case.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Legal ripple effects: Several outlets note the court’s reasoning in this case could shape how genocide is interpreted in international law, with potential relevance to other disputes currently before the ICJ, including South Africa’s case concerning the war in Gaza.</li><li>Why it matters: The hearings represent the first genocide case the ICJ will hear in full in more than a decade, underscoring the court’s role as a venue for state-to-state accountability claims.</li><li>Alleged crimes: Myanmar’s rulers face allegations including arson, rape and mass killings in the campaign targeting Rohingya communities, according to reporting on the case.</li><li>Beyond Myanmar: Coverage describes the proceedings as a landmark case with implications that extend beyond Myanmar, reflecting how international courts can influence norms even when enforcement is challenging.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>The Gambia: The Gambia brought the case to the ICJ alleging Myanmar violated the Genocide Convention in its treatment of the Rohingya, seeking a ruling on state responsibility.
