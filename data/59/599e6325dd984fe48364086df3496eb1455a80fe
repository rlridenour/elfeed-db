    Yesterday, I hosted a workshop on <i>Literate Programming with org-mode</i>
    for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Emacs-Hackers/events/228594251/">PDX Emacs Hackers</a> group. For everyone who couldn't attend, I
    decided to expand it into a tutorial.

    <b>PS:</b> I think that I have finally figured out my RSS woes, so you
    shouldn't have issues if you follow along.
