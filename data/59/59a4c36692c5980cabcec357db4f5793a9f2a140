<li>Carla Hall is cool (and also her branding is really subtle)</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: Real talk, I actually do use an electric kettle to make simple syrup for my homemade margarita mix</li>
</ul><h1>Getting Warmer</h1><p>Okay, two things right off the top:</p>

<li>We often pitch items that are branded by various Food Network celebrities by saying, “Look, who cares if it says Zakarian or Robert Irvine or whatever. It’s cheap! And, anyway, you can put a sticker over the name.” But Carla Hall? She’s actually cool. Like, probably the Food Network personality with the closest to a 100% approval rating.</li>

<p>And…</p>

<li>It doesn’t even really say her name on there. It’s just a little CH in a heart. Like this:</li>

<p>Food Network is my go-to comfort TV. When it’s time to unwind, and I don’t have the brain power to read, I turn on a cooking show to get some meal ideas and zone out a bit. I watch hours and hours of it. And even I would have no idea this is Carla Hall’s logo.</p>
<p>So, there you have it.</p>
<p>Now, onto the product itself.</p>
<p>The first thing you learn when you’re inducted into a hot-beverage subculture–whether it be related to coffee, tea, or whatever–is that there is a wide range of temperatures between hot-out-of-the-tap and boiling.</p>
<p>Too hot? You scorch the subtle flavor notes.</p>
<p>Not hot enough? You don’t unlock the subtle flavor notes.</p>
<p>A nice electric kettle like this one allows you to set the temperature, so you get exactly what you need for the perfect cup of coffee or tea.</p>
<p>Not a snob? That’s cool. You’ll still appreciate this thing. Because it’s just a lot nicer to fill something up and press a button than it is to turn on a burner on your stove. Also: safer.</p>
<p>Look, everyone should have a good electric kettle. So get this one if you need one.</p>
