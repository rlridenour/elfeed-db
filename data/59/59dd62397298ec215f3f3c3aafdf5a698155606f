Geekbench 6 benchmark results for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/17/m5-chip-macbook-pro-geekbench-benchmark/">already surfaced</a> prior to today, revealing that the M5 chip is up to around 20% faster in the laptop, compared to the equivalent previous-generation model with the M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
GPU improvements are more substantial, with the M5 chip offering up to 35% faster graphics compared to the M4 chip, according to Geekbench 6 results.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the M5 chip, there is only one notable change. The new 14-inch MacBook Pro supports PCIe 5.0 storage technology, and Apple says this results in up to 2× faster SSD read and write speeds compared to the previous-generation model.<br/>

<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/803349/apple-macbook-pro-14-m5-2025-review"><em>The Verge</em>'s Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> ran the AmorphousDiskMark benchmark tool on the new 14-inch MacBook Pro, and the results he shared in the chart below confirm that SSD read and write speeds are actually a little more than twice as fast compared to the equivalent previous-generation model. However, the speeds are roughly on par with the higher-end 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro chip.<br/>
