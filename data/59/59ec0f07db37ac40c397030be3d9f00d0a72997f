<p id="p2"><strong>John</strong>: As 2025 comes to an end, Federico and I thought we&rsquo;d cap off the year with<a href="https://www.macstories.net/setups/" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a final update on our setups</a>. We just went through this <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/macstories-setups-update-fresh-approaches-wi-fi-upgrades-and-handhelds/" rel="noopener noreferrer">in November</a>, but both Federico and I decided to take advantage of Black Friday sales to improve our setups in very different ways. Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p id="p3">My changes were primarily to my office setup. I&rsquo;ve wanted a gaming PC for a long time, but I never had a good place to set one up. The solution was to go with a high-end mini PC, <a href="https://amzn.to/48X2doA" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GMKtec EVO-X2</a>, which features a Strix Halo processor, 64GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD. It came with Windows installed, but after a few days, I installed <a href="https://bazzite.gg" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bazzite</a>, an open-source version of SteamOS, which makes it dead simple to access my Steam videogame library.</p>
<p id="p4">Two things kept me from getting a PC earlier. The first was space, which the EVO-X2 takes care of nicely because it&rsquo;s roughly the size of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111837" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Mac mini before its recent redesign</a>.</p>
<p id="p5">The second and bigger issue, though, was my Studio Display. It&rsquo;s an excellent screen, but it&rsquo;s showing its age with its 60Hz refresh rate and 600 nits of brightness. Plus, with one Thunderbolt port for connecting to your Mac and three USB-C ports, the Studio Display is limiting. Without HDMI or DisplayPort, connecting it to other video sources like a PC or game console is nearly impossible.</p>

<p id="p7">So I also bought a deeply discounted <a href="https://amzn.to/3YvfLTe" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASUS ROG Swift 32&rdquo; 4K OLED Gaming Monitor</a>, which is attached to my desk using a <a href="https://amzn.to/3YzjYoQ" rel="noopener noreferrer">VIVO VESA desk mount</a>. I&rsquo;d wanted a bigger screen for work anyway, and with its 240Hz refresh rate and bright OLED panel, the ASUS has been excellent. However, the ASUS display really shines when connected to my GMKtec and <a href="https://amzn.to/4pRiyT2" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. As I covered on <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPC: Next Portable Console</a> recently, the mini PC combined with a great monitor, which also allows me to stream games to my handhelds over my local network, was the missing link in my setup, delivering a flexibility I just didn&rsquo;t have before.</p>
<p id="p8">Along with the gaming part of my desktop setup, I updated my desktop lighting with two <a href="https://amzn.to/3MIsqj1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philips Hue Play Wall Washer lights</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/4rZ5s7x" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K</a>, which casts light against the wall behind my desk that&rsquo;s synced with what&rsquo;s onscreen. In fact, the Sync Box 8K works with all the Hue lights in my office, allowing me to create a more immersive environment when I&rsquo;m gaming.</p>
<p id="p9">I&rsquo;ve been using a handful of other accessories lately, too, including:</p>
<ul id="ul10"><li>an <a href="https://amzn.to/4iWwRml" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anker C300 battery</a> that has the capacity of roughly nine 10,000 mAh batteries, allowing me to charge multiple devices without thinking about whether my battery has enough charge,</li>
<li>the <a href="https://amzn.to/48HWLa4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philips Hue Bridge Pro</a>, an updated version of the bridge that connects the Philips Hue lights throughout my house,</li>
<li><a href="https://kuxiu.co/products/kuxiu-k1-ultra-power-bank?ref=ppgbbyut" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kuxiu&rsquo;s clever&nbsp;K1&nbsp;Ultra&nbsp;Qi 2.2&nbsp;battery pack</a>, which can charge multiple devices quickly and act as an iPhone stand,</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/48EBgqH" rel="noopener noreferrer">Native Union&rsquo;s Weighter</a>, a paperweight-like accessory for preventing cables from slipping off your desk, and</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4j33XBf" rel="noopener noreferrer">The MOFT Dynamic Folio</a>, an iPad case that folds into a wide variety of configurations for propping it while working.</li>
</ul><p id="p11">That&rsquo;s it from me for 2025, folks. Enjoy the holidays! Things will be a little quieter at MacStories over the next couple of weeks as we unwind and spend the time with family and friends over the holidays, but we&rsquo;ll be back with lots more before long.</p>
<p id="p12"><strong>Federico</strong>: For this final update to my setup before the end of the year, I focused on two key areas: audio and my living room TV setup.</p>
<p id="p13">The biggest &ndash; literally &ndash; upgrade for me this month has been switching from my previous LG 65&rdquo; TV to a flagship <a href="https://amzn.to/4j04Eeu" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG G5&nbsp;77&rdquo; model</a>. I&rsquo;d been keeping an eye on this TV for a while: it&rsquo;s LG&rsquo;s first model to use Tandem OLED technology, and it boasts higher brightness in both SDR and HDR with reduced reflections thanks to the new panel. I took advantage of an incredible Black Friday deal in Italy to buy it at 50% off, and we love it. The TV rests <em>almost</em> flush against the wall thanks to its compact design, but since it&rsquo;s not <em>completely</em> flush, it allowed us to re-install our <a href="https://amzn.to/3vnTE69" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philips Hue Gradient Light Strip</a> behind it. Since I was in a renovation mood and I also wanted to future-proof my setup for the Steam Machine in 2026, I also upgraded to a <a href="https://amzn.to/4p7eZqt" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hue Bridge Pro</a> and replaced my previous Hue Sync Box with the latest <a href="https://amzn.to/3Y3Fa6p" rel="noopener noreferrer">8K edition</a> that is certified for HDMI 2.1 connections. Speaking of gaming: as I <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/bazzite-boxes-145913013" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed this week on NPC</a>, I got a <a href="https://amzn.to/3XXHcF8" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beelink SER9 Pro mini PC</a> and installed Bazzite on it to get a taste for SteamOS in the living room; this one will eventually be replaced by a more powerful Steam Machine.</p>
<p id="p14">The other area of improvement was audio. I recently realized that I wanted to fully take advantage of Apple Music and Spotify&rsquo;s support for lossless playback with wireless headphones, which is something that, alas, Apple&rsquo;s AirPods Max do not support. So after much research, I decided to treat myself to a pair of <a href="https://amzn.to/48UV6Ni" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px8 S2</a>, which are widely considered some of the best Bluetooth headphones that you can buy right now. But you may be wondering: how do you even connect these headphones to Apple devices that do not support Qualcomm&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.aptx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">aptX Lossless or Adaptive codecs</a>? That&rsquo;s where the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Yzd5E9" rel="noopener noreferrer">BT-W6 Bluetooth dongle</a> comes in. In researching this field, I came across this relatively new category of small Bluetooth adapters that plug into an iPhone&rsquo;s USB-C port (they work on a Mac or iPad, too) and essentially override the device&rsquo;s built-in Bluetooth chip. Once headphones are paired with the dongle rather than the phone, wireless streaming from Apple Music or Spotify will use aptX Lossless instead of Apple&rsquo;s legacy SBC protocol. The difference in audio quality is outstanding, and it makes me appreciate the Px8 S2 for all they have to offer.</p>
<p id="p15">While I was at it, I also took advantage of another deal for a <a href="https://amzn.to/4aSMRUr" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonos Move 2 portable speaker</a>; we&rsquo;ll have to decide whether this one will be permanently docked on my desk or next to a record player that Silvia is getting me for Christmas. (We don&rsquo;t like surprises for each other, especially when it comes to furniture-adjacent shopping.)</p>
<p id="p16">So that&rsquo;s my update before we go on break for a couple of weeks. I can already feel that, when I&rsquo;m back, I&rsquo;ll have some changes to cover on the software front. But we&rsquo;ll talk about those in 2026.</p>
