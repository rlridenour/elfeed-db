<p><a>Excavating the Hawaiian History of Kaua‘i’s ‘Russian’ Fort</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Two centuries ago, King Kaumuali‘i was faced with an impossible decision: relinquish his island kingdom or doom his people to slaughter. With savvy diplomacy and a lot of careful maneuvering, Kaumuali‘i was able to avoid either fate. Adored by his people and respected by foreigners, Kaumuali‘i was, by all accounts, a king to rival all kings. But history has largely forgotten the man who would become the last ruler of Kaua‘i. Many children on Kaua‘i today only recognize his name because the island’s Highway 50 is named for him. But a local organization, Friends of King Kaumualiʻi, is determined to change that. Almost 200 years after his death, Kaumuali‘i has returned to Kaua‘i once more—this time as an eight-foot bronze statue overlooking the site of his royal compound and an adjacent star-shaped, basalt fort on the Hawaiian island.

<p>Slowly I’m learning more about Russia’s presence in the Americas and their interactions with the indigenous peoples they encountered.</p>
<p>I’m also learning about kingdoms like this one and <a href="https://culture-gate.jp/exhibition/memory/">Ryukyu</a> (modern day Okinawa &#038; local islands) that were subsumed by larger neighbors (themselves sometimes subsumed).</p>
