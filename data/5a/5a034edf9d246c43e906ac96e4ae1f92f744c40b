  <p>Meanwhile, the Trump Mobile “47 Plan” is pricier than the
unlimited plans from prepaid services operated by Verizon’s
Visible, AT&amp;T’s Cricket Wireless and T-Mobile’s Metro, which are
each around $40 per month.</p>

<p>The Trump T1 Phone, which runs Google’s Android operating system,
will cost $499. It features a 6.8-inch touch-screen with a 120 Hz
refresh rate. The smartphone also has a “fingerprint sensor and AI
Face Unlock,” according to the company’s website. Reps for Trump
Mobile didn’t respond to an inquiry about what company is
manufacturing the Android phone.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/trump-t1-phone-components-features-2415c7cd?mod=hp_lead_pos9">“Trump’s Smartphone Can’t Be Made in America for $499 by August”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A spokesman for the Trump Organization said in an email that
“manufacturing for the new phone will be in Alabama, California
and Florida.”</p>

<p>Despite the language in the press release, Eric Trump indicated
that the first wave of phones wouldn’t be built here. “You can
build these phones in the United States,” the Trump son told
podcaster Benny Johnson on Monday morning on The Benny Show after
holding up a gilded device that looked just like an Apple iPhone.
“Eventually, all the phones can be built in the United States of
America. We have to bring manufacturing back here.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Journal goofs, bigly, by claiming that the T1 “shows some specs that would beat Apple’s biggest, priciest iPhone models”. The T1 specs are so idiotic that one of them claims “5000mAh long life camera”, conflating battery capacity with (I guess?) focal distance.</p>

<p>The Verge, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/687492/trump-mobile-phone-t1">The Trump Mobile T1 Phone Looks Both Bad and Impossible</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where things get especially strange, though, is its supposed
combination of Android 15, 5G, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. In many
ways, these are opposing specs: Android 15 is generally only
available on very recent devices, many cheap phones still don’t
support 5G, and almost every phone maker has stopped including
headphone jacks with their devices in the last few years. There
are a few that have both, but modern phones with a headphone jack
are few and far between. And pretty much all made in China.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know what will be funnier — if Trump himself starts using one of these, or if he doesn’t.</p>

<p>I’ll give them credit for making them available exclusively in gold. That’s on brand. But I’m guessing the quality will be on par with Trump Watches, which is to say, <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/donald-trump-watch-delivered-typo">“RUMP”-quality</a>.</p>
