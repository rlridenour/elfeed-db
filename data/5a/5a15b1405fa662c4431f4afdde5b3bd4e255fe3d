<p>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg last week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The executive, Ke Yang, is leaving for Meta Platforms Inc.,
according to people with knowledge of the matter. Just weeks ago,
he was appointed head of a team called Answers, Knowledge and
Information, or AKI. The group is developing features to make the
Siri voice assistant more ChatGPT-like by adding the ability to
pull information from the web. [...]</p>

<p>The new Siri is being developed as a joint effort between Apple’s
artificial intelligence and machine learning group, known as AIML,
and the Siri engineering team now overseen by Craig Federighi’s
software organization. Within AIML, Yang was regarded as the most
prominent executive working on the new Siri initiative. His exit
ranks among the biggest departures from Apple’s AI organization
this year — a period marked by a steady exodus of top researchers
building the company’s AI core models.</p>

<p>Roughly a dozen members of that team — known internally as Apple
Foundation Models — have departed, including its founder and lead
scientist, Ruoming Pang. He and a number of others also joined
Meta, which is building a new group called Superintelligence Labs.</p>

<p>I am reminded of a piece Guy English wrote back in 2012, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210814031323/http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/305">Three Things That Should Trouble Apple</a>”, and that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/02/08/retention-of-talent">I’ve long thought</a> his third item, “People”, ought to have been the first:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ultimately, the retention of talent will be Apple’s
Achilles’ heel.</p>

<p>The smartest people will always want to be working on the smartest
thing. Sometimes that comes together in one amazing project. iOS
has been that project for this decade.</p>

<p>If there’s a problem for Apple it’s that they’ve already invented
the future. It’s a done deal. The best and brightest engineers and
product managers may move on to other ventures. Less likely to
succeed, of course, but that’s less of an issue for them given the
rainfall of AAPL gains. We’ll have to see what happens.</p>
