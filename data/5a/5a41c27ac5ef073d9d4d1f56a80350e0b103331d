Some folks like to see a visual indicator of the file type in file listings. In Emacs, this usually means in the Dired listings. Probably the best known way of doing this is the <a href="https://github.com/jtbm37/all-the-icons-dired">all-the-icons-dired</a> package. It has a set of beautiful icons that it adds to each entry to identify the file type. The problem, from some people&rsquo;s point of view, is that all-the-icons-dired is a third party package and may, in turn, require the installation of additional font files.

James Dyer likes the idea of a visual file-type indicator but doesn&rsquo;t like having to deal with external packages and their dependencies. His <a href="https://emacs.dyerdwelling.family/emacs/20250612223745-emacs--emacs-dired-with-ultra-lightweight-visual-icons/">solution</a> is a light-weight version of a visual icon package. Actually, it&rsquo;s not even a package, just a bit of code that you can add to your <code>init.el</code> to implement his solution.

The &ldquo;icons&rdquo; are just standard shapes that are in virtually all font sets. They aren&rsquo;t as pretty as those in all-the-icons-dired but they do serve to provide a visual indicator of file type. The shapes are listed in a simple variable so you can change them to suit your needs.

Being an old-time guy who spent a lot of years working on text terminals, I have no problem distinguishing file types by their extension—which is, after all, what all these packages do—so I don&rsquo;t feel the need for such a solution but if the idea appeals to you and you don&rsquo;t want to deal with dependencies, give Dyer&rsquo;s post a look. It&rsquo;s simple to try out and if you don&rsquo;t like it you can just delete the code from your <code>init.el</code>.</p>
