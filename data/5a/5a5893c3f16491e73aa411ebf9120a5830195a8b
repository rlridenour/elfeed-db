<p>President Donald Trump said he plans to meet next week with Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who is in exile and won the Nobel Peace Prize in October 2025. In interviews, Trump also said it would be a “great honor” if Machado chose to share her Nobel Peace Prize with him. The planned meeting comes days after an operation that resulted in the capture of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, leaving the country’s near-term governance and political pathway uncertain. Trump said moving Venezuela to a place where it can hold elections “will take time”.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/nufb6CGraA2kE0qMRsni3k0T7ElyIOJ2BiTP4KXfn8W8Lmm4vDRbGX-AiBNkr4avy8V9UgEiqEi9vJ5s4BVOzWfHA8O5KMPGJXoV3ksusn1vYCqFpjzDtCrV-tQljTovZ1AJUV12MN6bdEYHmfsJzcBpyFZmdwJoLrSM59P0ShfIKrQmiuLgf6Vk_ltSeM8OAzhem4X1y-bc5MtTcVUZWtQCIp-f-hJjyUX7GjCSwPXPEEu0t-th3N0I4_w' alt='Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado after receiving the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>First direct contact: Trump described the upcoming session as his first meeting with Machado, and Machado has said she had not spoken with him since her Nobel win.</li><li>Shifting stance: After previously dismissing Machado’s domestic support over the weekend, Trump later said he would meet her, signaling a change in tone as Washington weighs post-Maduro options.</li><li>Oil strategy: Trump outlined a Venezuela oil strategy alongside news of the meeting, linking U.S. policy on Venezuela’s energy sector with the broader political transition discussion.</li><li>War powers pushback: In the U.S. Senate, some Democrats and a Republican have pushed to block future U.S. strikes in the wake of the operation that captured Maduro.</li><li>Cartel threats: Trump also threatened possible land strikes against drug cartels in Latin America, widening the regional security dimension beyond Venezuela’s leadership question.</li></ul><blockquote>It would be a great honor - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: Trump says he will meet Machado next week, argues restoring conditions for Venezuelan elections will take time, and says it would be an honor to accept a shared Nobel Peace Prize if offered.
