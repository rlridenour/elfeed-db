Apple today updated its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120585">support document</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> on the web to add a mention that the feature now works on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, which appears to be relatively new.<br/>

A prior version of the support document listed only Macs, iPads, and PCs as being compatible with &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; on the web, but now there is a new mobile devices section that lists both iOS and iPadOS. <a href="https://maps.apple.com">Maps.apple.com</a> also loads on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; rather than redirecting maps URLs to the &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; app.<br/>
<br/>
When the &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; on the web feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-maps-now-available-on-the-web/">launched last year</a>, it was not available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and it only worked in select browsers. Apple has since expanded support, and it is available for Safari on Mac, Safari on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and also Edge, Chrome, and Firefox on Macs, PCs, and mobile devices.<br/>

It's possible that &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; on the web support for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was tied to iOS 18.4 and the option that allows EU users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/ios-18-4-new-setting/">select a new default mapping app</a>. With a different Maps app set, &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; links that an EU user receives are still be able to be opened via the &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; website.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/maps-on-web-iphone/">Apple Adds Maps on the Web Support to iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-maps-on-the-web-support-to-iphone.2455026/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
