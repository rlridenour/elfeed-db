<blockquote><p>
Sir,</p>
<p>There doesn&#8217;t seem very much left for us agnostics not to believe in.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Richard Crawford

<p>(But Graham Chapman said, &#8220;There&#8217;s really nothing an agnostic can&#8217;t do if he really doesn&#8217;t know whether he believes in anything or not.&#8221;)</p>
