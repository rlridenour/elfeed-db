<p>The United States and India announced an interim trade framework meant to set the stage for a broader trade agreement, and negotiators will keep working toward a full pact. Under the framework, the US cuts tariffs on Indian goods to 18% and removes an additional 25% duty, with a White House order taking effect February 7. Officials in both countries pitched the move as an economic reset meant to widen market access and lift bilateral commerce, while leaving major details for follow-on talks.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/tOexe0CJ_BaQ0aWcqXu56MEMlYRsRjq0WGOk0QAEh09DQTqeDk7LfYdMkLEgNmHYsQYrDpCd-ikDMd2gdQpAXsYm5quwslWZgU-jB4tpY3CkgRRcOcmhFXVcZLLTCKPwVQUhivv5AiaC5oBis9wYyW0z_F6MVGfpP3HQOVgAow-y2IduVds' alt='US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (file photo used with trade-duty announcement).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Domestic safeguards/roadmap: Indian coverage said the framework couples tariff changes with protections for sensitive groups such as farmers, plus a roadmap toward a full bilateral trade agreement.</li><li>Defense pillar: The White House executive order pointed to India’s commitment to a framework to expand US-India defence cooperation over the next 10 years.</li><li>Exporter expectations: India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal said the framework opens a “$30 trillion market” for Indian exporters, and he singled out MSMEs as key beneficiaries.</li><li>Energy linkage: President Trump said India would stop buying Russian oil and shift purchases toward US products, though some reports said the joint statement does not explicitly mention this.</li><li>Potential next cuts: US coverage said Washington is weighing further tariff reductions for India beyond what the interim framework set.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi: Modi welcomed the interim trade framework and credited President Trump’s personal involvement, calling the agreement a sign of deepening trust in the partnership.
