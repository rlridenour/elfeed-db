<p>Like <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/announcing-casual-make.html">Make</a>, the CSV file format will outlive us all. That said, editing a CSV file is a precarious task, as it can be easy to violate its separator and escape rules. Thankfully, the Emacs ecosystem has got you covered, with the 3rd party ELPA package <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/csv-mode.html">csv-mode</a>. This mode provides all kinds of conveniences including:</p>
<ul>
<li>spreadsheet-like visualizing and editing of fields (field alignment)</li>
<li>separator auto-detection (comma, tab, space, etc.)</li>
<li>support for quoted fields</li>
<li>sorting by fields</li>
<li>killing and yanking fields</li>
</ul>
<p>To aid in the discovery and usage of these features, I’m happy to announce <a href="https://kickingvegas.github.io/casual/CSV.html">Casual CSV</a>, a Transient menu for <code>csv-mode</code>, now available in the <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/releases/tag/2.11.0">Casual v2.11.1 update</a> on MELPA.</p>

</p>

<p>One notable feature Casual CSV adds is the ability to select a region of rows to copy to the <code>kill-ring</code> as an Org table. This is also usable in Markdown flavors that support tables.</p>
<h1>Closing Thoughts and Caveats</h1>
<p>YMMV on how well <code>csv-mode</code> works for you as its performance is tied to the size of CSV file you are working with. If you are trying to edit a CSV file that is hundreds of megabytes in size or greater, you might want to think twice before doing this in Emacs with <code>csv-mode</code>.</p>
<p>As a general rule, I try to avoid editing CSV files in the first place, as I prefer to think of them as files for data exchange. My ideal use-case for <code>csv-mode</code> is really for viewing. That said, if you really need to edit a CSV file, it is best to copy it first. Casual CSV reflects this sensibility by offering a command to duplicate a file.</p>
<p>To get the best results out of <code>csv-mode</code>, I highly recommend turning on field alignment and separator auto-detection. In addition, turning off line-wrapping will aid in both visualization and navigation. The following Elisp configuration shows how to do this.</p>
