<p>The US Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 3.5%–3.75%, marking a third consecutive cut and the lowest level in nearly three years. Policymakers acted despite inflation that they say is still above their comfort zone, citing signs that the labor market may be weaker than headline figures suggest and wanting to support employment. The decision exposed unusually public divisions inside the central bank, with at least three officials dissenting over whether to keep rates unchanged or cut by a larger amount. New projections indicate that most officials foresee only very limited additional easing next year and just one more small cut in 2026, even as they expect inflation to drift closer to target and economic growth to remain modestly above trend. The stance sets up a potential policy clash with President Trump, who has been urging steeper, faster reductions and has signaled he wants the next Fed chair to prioritize lower borrowing costs.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/oF8bK6WxKP8zSTfV3-R2KmQxjhLrCHLzFPElpt-OfnD8FSblQ98WgnGIt3Qv4-WaJkP1iNvBFegBItaCLyGoQJ1CH__G1jbHJv7fiZMf5nbr7lF0DEyOAOlhM7o9w5rZsGQe7HVlQUWzuE_nujVQHVphEiF4Lza3Gl0TG_zfWQw' alt='Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks at a press conference on US monetary policy.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Internal divisions: Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee and Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid preferred to hold rates steady, while Fed governor Stephen Miran argued for a larger half‑point reduction, producing the first three-way split of this kind in six years.</li><li>Future rate path: Fresh Fed projections show policymakers collectively anticipate only one additional quarter‑point cut in 2026, a slower easing path than financial markets currently price in.</li><li>Labor market worries: Officials highlighted concerns that job conditions may be softer than headline unemployment figures imply, with Jerome Powell saying risks to employment are now tilted to the downside.</li><li>Inflation outlook: The Fed expects inflation to decline toward roughly 2.4% by the end of next year while still characterizing current price pressures as &quot;somewhat elevated.&quot;</li><li>Political backdrop: The latest move comes ahead of a high‑stakes US midterm election year, in which economic performance and interest‑rate levels are expected to feature prominently in political debate.</li></ul><blockquote>If nobody is fully happy or angry, then they probably did their job - Unnamed market strategist quoted in the article</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Federal Reserve leadership: Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that while inflation risks remain on the upside, policymakers also see growing downside risks for the labor market, warranting cautious support for employment through modest rate cuts..
