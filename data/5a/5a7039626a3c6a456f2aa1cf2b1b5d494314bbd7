<p>Can't miss out on all the new fun. Emacs 25 RC2 is out and lots of people already using it. Since I'm mostly on MacOS these days, installing via homebrew with –devel, gets you RC2:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">brew install emacs --devel --with-cocoa --with-gnutls --with-librsvg --with-imagemagick
</code></pre>

<p>The only hiccup so far's been org mode failing to export, which was fixed by re-installing it (follow <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2015-08/msg00320.html">this thread</a>).</p>
