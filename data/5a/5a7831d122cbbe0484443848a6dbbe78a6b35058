The Ceramic Shield 2 material that Apple uses for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> display includes an anti-reflective coating that's designed to cut down on glare. It's a coating that prior-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models didn't have, and it can make a difference in bright lighting conditions.<br/>

If you're someone who likes to use a screen protector with your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, you might be nullifying the anti-reflective property of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; display, based on <a href="https://astropad.com/blog/iphone-17-fresh-coat-reflection-data/">testing done by Astropad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, Astropad found that the anti-reflective coating reduces reflections by approximately 50 percent when compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, but applying a screen protector without an anti-reflective coating of its own makes the anti-reflective Ceramic Shield 2 coating less effective. According to Astropad, this is because AR coatings are created for direct contact with air, and covering them with an extra layer of material cancels the effect.<br/>
<br/>
Astropad did screen protector testing because <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/products/fresh-coat?_ga=2.190058219.1903998822.1764813294-585524705.1764813294">it sells Fresh Coat</a>, a screen protector with an anti-reflective coating, and it is promoting Fresh Coat through its testing and report. Astropad says that Fresh Coat and other screen protectors with an anti-reflective coating can replace or even outperform the anti-reflective properties of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;'s display.<br/>
<blockquote>Fresh Coat by Astropad enhances AR clarity on any iPhone, creating a surface nearly 4x less reflective than the display on an iPhone 16 and 2x less reflective than iPhone 17's Ceramic Shield 2.</blockquote><br/>
