<p>The Trump administration is winding down “Operation Metro Surge,” a major federal immigration-enforcement deployment centered on the Minneapolis–St. Paul area, after border czar Tom Homan said he recommended ending it and President Trump agreed. Homan said agents will scale back through next week, while federal authorities say immigration enforcement will continue nationwide. The operation led to thousands of arrests and became a flashpoint after mass protests and the killing of two US citizens during the crackdown. Officials have said the effort focused on “dangerous criminal illegal aliens,” but other reporting says many people without criminal records—including children and US citizens—were detained, fueling criticism of the tactics.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/4hzFgOWbnRhLGyrBu5DdEqOKbY_r7YXl8-5t3r5eivjI10SVk_A7xoY6B6afMntjYjwxv64z0fk_xKzGfBWs6n9uKxjndrf0drbGoVHaYt-9' alt='US official Tom Homan announces a drawdown of immigration operations in Minnesota during a press conference in Minneapolis on February 12.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Arrest totals: Federal authorities said the Minneapolis–St. Paul sweeps led to more than 4,000 arrests during the surge.</li><li>Deaths named: Reporting identified the two US citizens killed during the period as Renee Good and Alex Pretti, and their deaths intensified criticism of the operation.</li><li>Broader pullbacks: Semafor reported the Minnesota drawdown came amid a wider federal pullback that included a quiet withdrawal of National Guard troops from Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, citing The Washington Post.</li><li>Political pressure: The Wall Street Journal, cited by Semafor, said the crackdowns became a political liability for Republicans ahead of the midterm elections, as polling showed Americans souring on maximalist enforcement tactics.</li><li>Next target unclear: Homan said officers could be deployed to another location but gave no details, as speculation swirled about which city might be targeted next.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Tom Homan (White House border czar): He said he recommended ending the surge and Trump agreed, adding that a significant drawdown was already under way and would continue into next week.
