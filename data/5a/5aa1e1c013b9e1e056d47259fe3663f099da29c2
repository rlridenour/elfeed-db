<p>I've enjoyed watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15227418/">A Murder at the End of the World</a>. The show may resonate with folks following the tech world. Won't say much more than that…</p>
<p>What I can maybe say is, the shows features <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave browser</a>, terminal usage (ifconfig, nmap, hydra, responder), and a reference to the good 'ol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">Vi vs Emacs rivalry</a>, which I hope folks these days don't take further than friendly teasing between dear cousins.</p>
<p>In any case, being an Emacs nut, the scene gave me a good tickle. It's a great show, with a lovely Emacs cherry on top! While the show title and description didn't immediately draw me in, I'm glad I gave it a chance.</p>
