In his Baptist News Global piece, “ <a href="https://baptistnews.com/article/heres-what-the-churches-of-christ-and-maga-have-in-common/">Here’s what the Churches of Christ and MAGA have in common</a>,” Richard T. Hughes writes:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
The problem would be just as acute had Churches of Christ been captured by Democratic as opposed to Republican interests since both parties — indeed, all political parties — are wed to the right-side-up interests of power, wealth and control. Disciples of Jesus, however, pledge allegiance to the upside-down kingdom of God where they serve the least of these, place the interests of others above their own, and stand in solidarity with oppressed and marginalized people.
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
Hughes is speaking about the Churches of Christ, but it is true of all Christian denominations. It is tempting to align ourselves with a political party in order to use that party as a tool of the gospel, but the inevitable consequence is that the resulting perversion of the gospel instead becomes a tool that the party uses to maintain power.
</p>

 <p>
We have but one Lord and one King, Jesus Christ.
