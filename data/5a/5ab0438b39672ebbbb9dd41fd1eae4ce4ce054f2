Researchers at cybersecurity firm Oligo today outlined a series of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> vulnerabilities that impact millions of Apple devices (<em>via <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/airborne-airplay-flaws/">Wired</a></em>) and accessories that connect to Apple devices. While Apple has addressed the flaws in security updates that have come out over the last several months, some third-party devices that support &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; remain vulnerable.<br/>

Dubbed "Airborne," the &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; vulnerabilities allowed attackers to take control of devices that support &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; to spread malware to other devices on any local device that the infected device connects to. An attacker would need to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the intended victim, putting public Wi-Fi spots, businesses, and other high-traffic areas at more risk.<br/>
<br/>
Oligo researchers said that the &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; flaws could lead to "sophisticated attacks related to espionage, ransomware, supply-chain attacks, and more." The vulnerabilities could be used independently or chained together for a "variety of possible attack vectors," such as Remote Code Execution, user interaction bypass, Denial of Service attacks, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple worked with Oligo to identify and fix the vulnerabilities. Oligo found 23 separate security flaws, and Apple issued 17 CVEs to address them. Information on each vulnerability is <a href="https://www.oligo.security/blog/airborne">outlined on Oligo's website</a>. Apple also deployed fixes for its &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; SDK for third-party manufacturers.<br/>
<br/>
The same Airborne vulnerabilities also impact <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, which could allow hackers to hijack the automotive computer in a car. This attack vector would require the attacker to be directly in the car and connected to either the car's Bluetooth or an in-car USB port, which makes it unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
Oligo recommends that users upgrade to the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS, to protect themselves from these vulnerabilities. Other devices that support &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; may still be vulnerable, so users should take steps like disabling the &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; Receiver feature on Macs and restricting &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; to the current user instead of all users.<br/>

Oligo CTO Gal Elbaz told <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/airborne-airplay-flaws/">Wired</a></em> that there could be tens of millions of third-party &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; devices that are still vulnerable to attack. Because &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; is supported in such a wide variety of devices, there are a lot that will take years to patch--or they will never be patched," he said.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/29/airplay-vulnerabilities-third-party-devices/">AirPlay Security Flaws Impact Third-Party Devices and Unpatched Apple Products</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airplay-security-flaws-impact-third-party-devices-and-unpatched-apple-products.2456204/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
