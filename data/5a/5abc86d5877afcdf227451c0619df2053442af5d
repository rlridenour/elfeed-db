<p>In Toronto, 7,000 singers participated in Choir Choir Choir’s tribute to Ozzy Osbourne, all taking part in a giant sing-along of “Paranoid.”&nbsp; The first single on Black Sabbath’s second album (1970), “Paranoid” reached #4 in the UK market and put Sabbath on the map. The song also became an early heavy metal classic.
