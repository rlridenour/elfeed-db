<p>Kev shared <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/how-you-read-my-content-the-answers/">recent survey results</a> on how people read his website. Unsurprisingly, almost everyone (by a large margin) read his blog via RSS - myself included.</p>
<p>80% of the folks I find with blogs and RSS feeds are techies, and that bothers me - the normies don&rsquo;t know what RSS is and how to use it.</p>
