Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-Top-Left-Hole-Punch-Face-ID-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000739" /><br/>
One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle this year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027.<br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #1A579E; margin-top: 2px;">Overall Design </span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1A579E; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro Style</span><br><br/>
Rumors suggest the iPhone 18 Pro lineup will largely retain the same design as the iPhone 17 Pro models. The rear camera system will look identical to the current generation, featuring a raised "plateau" with three lenses arranged in a triangle. Display sizes are also expected to remain unchanged, with the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max continuing to use 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch panels, respectively – the same dimensions introduced with the iPhone 16 Pro series. iPhone 18 Pro models could drop the current two-tone look of the rear casing found on the iPhone 17 Pro in favor of a more seamless aesthetic. For the next-generation models, Apple has apparently updated the back-glass "replacement process" to minimize the color difference between the Ceramic Shield 2 glass and the aluminum frame, resulting in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/11/iphone-18-pro-drop-rear-two-tone-look/">more unified appearance</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #1A579E; margin-top: 2px;">Thicker Chassis</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1A579E; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Bigger Battery?</span><br><br/>
According to one rumor, the body of the iPhone 18 Pro Max will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/12/iphone-18-pro-max-heaviest-iphone-ever/">slightly thicker</a> than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, raising the device's weight to around 243 grams. That would make the iPhone 18 Pro Max approximately 3 grams more than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which is currently the heaviest model Apple has produced. We don't know the exact reason for the alleged thicker design of the iPhone 18 Pro Max, but a larger battery is the most likely cause.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #1A579E; margin-top: 2px;">Smaller Dynamic Island</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1A579E; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Under-Screen Face ID?</span><br><br/>
Rumors continue to circulate about whether the iPhone 18 Pro models will introduce under-display Face ID, but reports remain divided on when the technology will actually arrive. The feature would move the TrueDepth camera system beneath the display, eliminating the need for the current Dynamic Island cutout.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/iphone-18-pro-features-report/">Wayne Ma of <em>The Information</em></a>, Apple is targeting a design without a Dynamic Island, replacing it with a single pinhole camera in the upper-left corner of the screen. However, other sources dispute that claim. Display analyst Ross Young <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/iphone-18-pro-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/">believes</a> under-display Face ID is possible for the iPhone 18 Pro, but says a smaller Dynamic Island will still be present. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has echoed this view, reporting that the new models will feature a slimmed-down Dynamic Island rather than removing it entirely. Apple is also said to be testing new camera miniaturization technology to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/07/iphone-18-pro-smaller-front-camera/">reduce the size of the front-facing camera</a> currently located within the Dynamic Island.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Chinese leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/iphone-18-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/">Instant Digital</a> has offered yet another version of events, saying the Dynamic Island will shrink in size, but that under-display Face ID and camera technology won't debut next year. Overall, the consensus suggests Apple may be refining the Dynamic Island before fully transitioning to an all-screen design in future generations.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #1A579E; margin-top: 2px;">A20 Pro Chip</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1A579E; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">2nm Process</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 18 Pro models will use Apple's A20 chip, based on TSMC's 2nm process for power and efficiency improvements. A move to 2nm fabrication increases transistor density, which will enable higher performance. The A20 series is expected to deliver roughly a 15 percent speed gain and about 30 percent better efficiency compared with the A19 series used in Apple's iPhone 17 models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's A20 chip will be packaged with TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/kuo-on-iphone-18-a20-chip-packaging/">Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) technology</a>, suggesting at least some A20 chips will have RAM integrated directly onto the same wafer as the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine, rather than sitting adjacent to the chip and connected via a silicon interposer. This could contribute to faster performance for both overall tasks and Apple Intelligence, and longer battery life from improved power efficiency.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #1A579E; margin-top: 2px;">C2 Modem</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1A579E; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Replacing Qualcomm</span><br><br/>
Apple plans to include its next-generation C2 modem in the iPhone 18 Pro models, according to supply chain <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-18-pro-c2-modem-rumor/">analyst Jeff Pu</a>. The chip will succeed the C1 modem, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">debuted</a> in the lower-cost iPhone 16e as Apple's first in-house cellular modem, and the C1X modem chip in the iPhone Air, which Apple says is up to 2× faster than the C1. The C2 is expected to bring faster speeds, improved power efficiency, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/">support for mmWave 5G</a> in the United States – a feature missing from the C1 and C1X.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's modem roadmap is part of a long-term strategy to reduce reliance on Qualcomm, which currently supplies 5G modems for the rest of the iPhone lineup. The company has been working on developing its own cellular chips for years, aiming for deeper integration and greater control over power management and performance.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #1A579E; margin-top: 2px;">New Camera Sensor</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1A579E; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Samsung-Made</span><br><br/>
Samsung is working on a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-18-samsung-camera-sensor-report/">three-layer stacked image sensor</a>, reportedly intended for the iPhone 18. The sensor, referred to as PD-TR-Logic, integrates three layers of circuitry, which would improve camera responsiveness, reduce noise, and increase dynamic range. The leak comes from a source known as "<a href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1874358213011005628">Jukanlosreve</a>," who claims the sensor is being developed specifically for Apple's 2026 iPhone lineup. Sony has long been Apple's sole image sensor supplier, so Samsung's entry would be a big shift in the iPhone's camera supply chain. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #1A579E; margin-top: 2px;">Variable Aperture</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1A579E; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">DSLR-Style</span><br><br/>
Apple intends to equip this year's iPhone 18 Pro models with a variable aperture lens, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/27/iphone-18-pro-variable-aperture-camera/">according to reports</a>. Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station claims the main rear camera – what Apple calls the 48-megapixel Fusion camera – on both iPhone 18 Pro models will offer variable aperture, which would be a first for the iPhone. A variable-aperture system physically adjusts the lens opening, letting more light in for low-light shots or narrowing the opening for brighter scenes and deeper depth of field.<br/>
<br/>
The main cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro, 16 Pro, and 17 Pro all use a fixed ƒ/1.78 aperture, where the lens is permanently set to its widest setting. With a variable lens, the iPhone 18 Pro would allow users to manually shift the aperture, similar to on a DSLR camera. This would mean more control over depth of field, enabling sharper focus on subjects or smoother background blur. Industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/variable-aperture-rumored-for-iphone-18-pro/">November 2024</a> that Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models will get the feature.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #1A579E; margin-top: 2px;">5G Satellite Internet</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1A579E; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Non-Terrestrial Data</span><br><br/>
According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/24/iphone-18-pro-full-5g-satellite-internet-rumor/">report</a> by <em>The Information</em>, Apple plans to add support for 5G networks that operate via satellites rather than Earth-based towers as early as next year. This advancement would allow future iPhones to gain full internet connectivity through satellite, not just limited emergency features.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple meets the 2026 target, the first devices to feature 5G satellite internet would likely be the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and the long-rumored foldable iPhone. Apple partners with Globalstar for its iPhone satellite features, but there is currently no service that delivers full 5G satellite internet directly to a smartphone, and the report did not specify who would supply it.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #1A579E; margin-top: 2px;">Simplified Camera Control</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1A579E; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">New Design</span><br><br/>
Apple is reportedly working to simplify the Camera Control button's design on iPhone 18 models in order to reduce costs. The current Camera Control button on iPhone 17 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the force sensor recognizes different pressure levels for taps, presses, and swipes.<br/>
<br/>
However, according to the Weibo-based account Instant Digital, Apple will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/iphone-18-camera-control-capacitive/">remove the capacitive sensing layer</a> and retain only pressure sensing recognition in the second iteration to achieve all Camera Control functions on the iPhone 18. The simplified version is not about reducing functionality in the button, but about saving money. The current solution is said to be very expensive for Apple and is generating costly after-sales repairs.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #1A579E; margin-top: 2px;">New Colors</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #1A579E; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Three in Testing</span><br><br/>
Apple is rumored to be testing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/04/iphone-18-pro-rumored-colors/">three new color options</a> for the iPhone 18 Pro models: burgundy, brown, and purple. A burgundy finish would mark the first time the Pro and Pro Max models have been offered in any shade of red, apart from the lighter (PRODUCT)RED used on earlier devices. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max were previously available in Deep Purple, and Apple has never released an iPhone in a genuinely brown color.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/10-reasons-iphone-18-pro-worth-waiting-for/">10 Reasons to Wait for This Year&#039;s iPhone 18 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/10-reasons-to-wait-for-this-years-iphone-18-pro.2475753/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
