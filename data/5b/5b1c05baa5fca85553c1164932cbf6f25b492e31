If you could have only one thing for Christmas
</p>

 <p>
In today’s  <a href="http://wapo.st/dHHR2P">Washington Post</a>, Petula Dvorak’s column includes a story about a 6-year-old who was told by her mother to scale back her Christmas list. So, she wrote a letter to “Dear Sata” asking for just one thing, a remote control that controlled the world.

 <p>
When her mother pointed out that the salutation was missing an “N”, she simply added it to the end of the name. So, it read, “Dear Satan,…” Fitting, somehow.
