<p>Think of democracy as a machine. At fixed intervals, the preferences of individual citizens are fed into the machine, and it aggregates them and produces a &#8220;choice&#8221; of its own. Democratic rule is achieved if, when the machine isn&#8217;t working, its most recent choice is acted upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question now arises: What is the authority of the choice expressed by the machine?&#8221; writes philosopher Richard Wollheim. &#8220;More specifically, why should someone who has fed his choice into the machine and then is confronted by the machine with a choice non-identical with his own, feel any obligation to accept it?&#8221;</p>
