<p>For the last 33 days, I&#8217;ve been on an epic quest to deliver a magic ring to Fire Mountain, where I must destroy it before it falls into the hands of an evil wizard with a rather large eyeball. I’ve walked 97.4 miles and I’m currently spending time with “Old Tom”.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m talking about an app I recently discovered called&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantasy-hike/id1557127861">Fantasy Hike</a>. It tracks your steps and reports your progress through a very Lord of the Rings-like journey, without actually using any Lord of the Rings intellectual property.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve read the books, you&#8217;ll find plenty of Easter eggs sprinkled throughout, a nod to Sam and Frodo&#8217;s adventure. The nerd part of me loves this application. It’s a 1,700-mile journey, and it may be a while before I reach Mountain Doom…<em>ahem</em>…Mount Fire. But I intend to enjoy every step along the way.</p>



<p>The developers describe it as&nbsp;<em>&#8220;a fun way to get moving: set off on an epic journey, take real-world steps to progress, and unlock achievements along the path.&#8221;</em>&nbsp;And honestly, it feels exactly like that.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re even remotely Lord of the Rings-adjacent, I recommend giving Fantasy Hike a try. It&#8217;s the perfect excuse to walk a little farther.</p>
