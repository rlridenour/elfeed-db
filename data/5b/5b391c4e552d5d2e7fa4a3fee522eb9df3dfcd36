<p>Carlos Greaves, writing for McSweeney’s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The president remained steadfast in his novel interpretation of
constitutional law.”</p>

<p>“Faced with the choice between clinging to the letter of the law
and marching to the beat of his own legal drum, the president
chose the latter.”</p>
</blockquote>
