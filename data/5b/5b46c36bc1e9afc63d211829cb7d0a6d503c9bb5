Intro  EDIT [2021-09-27 Mon]: decreased hl-line-flash-show-period1  I learned about beacon.el2 in one of Sacha Chua&rsquo;s videos3 that asted users about their favorite tweaks, and it remained one that I found useful throughout several years with emacs. However, it stopped working somewhere in version 27, with a number of glitches that were eventually recognized in the repo, but no fix was available.
Beacon candy Beacon was nice because it didn&rsquo;t highlight the whole line, but only a gradient extending from your cursor, which would gently fade away (at least, that was the idea).
