<p> I usually enjoy Anil Dash&rsquo;s writing, especially when I don&rsquo;t agree. Typically I find M. Dash&rsquo;s writing tempered and well reasoned. </p>
<p> The angst over Mozilla including more and more AI in the Firefox web browser triggered what I read as a rant from emotion: </p>
<blockquote>
<p> … so give them a toggle switch and write up a blog post explaining how extraordinarily expensive it is to maintain a configuration option over the lifespan of a global product </p>

<p> <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2025/11/14/wanting-not-to-want-ai/">I know you don’t want them to want AI, but… &#8211; Anil Dash</a> </p>
<p> See. It&rsquo;s thinking like what M. Dash wrote that leads to conflict and tension between users and developers. </p>
<p> If they&rsquo;re not developing these programs for the users, then why are they developing at all? Setting aside the irrational <a rel="tag" class="hashtag u-tag u-category" href="https://plrj.org/tag/neverai/">#neverAI</a> folks (of whom I&rsquo;m reformed while retaining skepticism), there are ample other use cases where have the big &ldquo;turn AI off&rdquo; switch would be a boon —basically everyone who needs to be able to prove the integrity of their work as one example set. I&rsquo;m disappointed M. Dash can&rsquo;t see them. </p>
<p> Just because a developer decides to include functionality does not mean all, most, or any users must embrace it. </p>
