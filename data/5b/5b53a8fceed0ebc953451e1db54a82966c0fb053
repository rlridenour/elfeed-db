The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-1-beta-features/">iOS 26.1 update</a> includes a small but helpful change for iPhones, and it could prevent you from running late to something important.<br/>

Specifically, when an alarm goes off in the Clock app, there is a new "slide to stop" control on the screen for turning off the alarm. On previous iOS 26 versions, there is simply a large "stop" button, which could be accidentally tapped.<br/>
<br/>
The new "slide to stop" control looks very similar to the classic "slide to unlock" bar that existed on the iPhone's Lock Screen from 2007 until 2016.<br/>

Given that the iOS 26.1 Release Candidate was seeded earlier this week, Apple will likely release the update next week, on either Monday or Tuesday.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/31/ios-26-1-includes-a-small-but-useful-change/">iOS 26.1 Brings Back 2007 Feature in New Way</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-1-brings-back-2007-feature-in-new-way.2470217/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
