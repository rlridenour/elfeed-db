<p>Nellie Andreeva, reporting for Deadline back on September 23:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The release of Apple TV+’s <em>The Savant</em> has been put on hold. The
decision comes three days before the thriller starring Jessica
Chastain was slated to premiere on the streamer Sept. 26. No new
date has been set.</p>

<p>“After careful consideration, we have made the decision to
postpone The Savant,” an Apple TV+ spokesperson said in a
statement to Deadline. “We appreciate your understanding and look
forward to releasing the series at a future date.”</p>

<p>The streamer would not elaborate on the reasons for the
last-minute change but <em>The Savant</em>’s subject matter is believed
to be behind it, with the storyline about preventing extremist
attacks and some of the imagery considered possibly triggering
following the Sept. 10 assassination of right-wing political
activist Charlie Kirk. The series includes a sniper in action and
the bombing of a government building among other acts of violence.</p>

<p>Jessica Chastain, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DO_V2EyEZmj/">in a post on Instagram later that same day</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to say how much I value my partnership with Apple.
They’ve been incredible collaborators and I deeply respect their
team. That said, I wanted to reach out and let you know that
we’re not aligned on the decision to pause the release of <em>The
Savant</em>. [...]</p>

<p>I’ve never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish
this show wasn’t so relevant, unfortunately it is. <em>The Savant</em>
is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it
happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever.
While I respect Apple’s decision to pause the release for now, I
remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon. Until then,
I’m wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I’ll let you
know if and when <em>The Savant</em> is released.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we are nearly three weeks later, and it’s still a question of <em>if</em>, not <em>when</em> — <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/the-savant/umc.cmc.aar44keiny3h54xvaakg260q">Apple TV’s page for <em>The Savant</em></a> still has it labeled “Coming: At a Later Date”. </p>
