<p>The first time I saw <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Wdired.html">wdired</a> in action, it blew my mind. wdired makes <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html#Dired">dired</a> (directory editor) buffers writeable, so you can edit them like any other Emacs buffer. You can subsequently use all your favorite file-editing tricks to rename files (amongst other things). You can see it in action at the end of <a href="http://emacsrocks.com/e16.html">Emacs Rocks episode 16</a>.</p>
<p>When combining <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-and-Find.html">find-dired</a> with wdired, one can easily find matching files and quickly batch rename them using something like <a href="https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el">multiple cursors</a> or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html">keyboard macros</a>. I've been a fan of the <em>find-dired</em> -&gt; <em>dired-toggle-read-only</em> -&gt; <em>mc/mark-all-like-this</em> workflow for quite some time, but I always wished I could adjust <em>find-dired</em> queries a little quicker by getting immediate feedback.</p>
<p>Completion frontends like <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">ivy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">helm</a> are perfect for getting this kind of immediate feedback. Peeking into ivy's <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/blob/master/counsel.el">counsel source</a>, I borrowed some ideas to glue counsel-style narrowing on a find command, which I can easily translate to a writeable dired buffer for all that joyful-mutiple-cursor-editing experience.</p>

<p>The code for <em>ar/counsel-find</em> is a little rough but can be found at <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/master/emacs/ar/ar-counsel-find.el">here</a>.</p>
