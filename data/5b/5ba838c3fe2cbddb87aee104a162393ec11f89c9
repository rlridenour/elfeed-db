<p>Russian drone and missile attacks on areas in and around Kyiv over the weekend killed at least three people in the capital region and injured others in separate incidents, including a strike on a high‑rise building in Vyshgorod just north of the city. Local authorities said rescuers evacuated residents and fought fires after an &quot;enemy&quot; drone hit the residential block, while regional officials confirmed one fatality and multiple injuries there, including a child. The assaults came as a Ukrainian delegation traveled to the United States, where negotiators are due to meet senior Trump administration officials in Florida to work on a renewed push to end Russia&#x27;s full-scale war against Ukraine. Those talks are expected to help shape later discussions planned in Moscow with President Vladimir Putin, raising cautious hopes that intensified diplomacy might eventually reduce the suffering caused by continued attacks.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/sjD3TvB3jmrhwQGbb7NG-zFHDdP28TIAJjrehraB50k7U6QjlZMwf-H5lyrg0cZfkz7_ogYrk-VrH8L7felchOGvUsu4l04ekqBGIwIfGfXNhZBAmRuR1UKHy4iw1ODWregzGEGyOVpC1hRvlpN1LJSa1KvGwSbnVWxpantbxyWrXOc9Fd80XZS6W2xLF_zeyS7-ydYE3HSzZwiMuSEhAYuaFTYtmhgx059a8t8' alt='Emergency workers inspect damaged residential buildings in the Kyiv region after overnight Russian drone and missile strikes.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Residential damage: In the Vyshgorod district outside Kyiv, a drone strike hit a multi‑storey apartment block, forcing emergency services to carry out large‑scale evacuations while firefighters battled blazes inside the damaged building.</li><li>Multiple attack waves: Officials in Kyiv reported that the weekend strikes formed part of a broader pattern of overnight drone and missile barrages targeting the wider capital region, prompting air raid alerts and defensive responses across the area.</li><li>Child among wounded: Regional authorities said that among those injured in the Vyshgorod incident was at least one child, highlighting the continued risk to families living near front‑line and high‑risk urban zones.</li><li>Role of Florida talks: Ukrainian negotiators are heading specifically to Florida, where they will consult with senior members of the Trump administration on possible parameters for ending hostilities before subsequent contacts with Russian leadership.</li><li>Diplomatic sequencing: The Florida meetings are described as helping to set the stage for key talks expected in Moscow with President Vladimir Putin, suggesting a step‑by‑step diplomatic effort involving both Kyiv&#x27;s partners and Russia&#x27;s leadership.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Kyiv regional authorities: The Kyiv regional governor described the incident in Vyshgorod as &quot;another&quot; enemy drone attack and reported that rescuers were evacuating residents and that firefighting operations were ongoing at the high‑rise building.
