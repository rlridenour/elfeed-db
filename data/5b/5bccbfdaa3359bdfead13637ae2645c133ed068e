Every video on YouTube is available in the new, standalone visionOS app, including standard videos, 180° videos, 360° videos, and YouTube Shorts. And on the Apple Vision Pro with the M5 chip, you can even watch YouTube videos in 8K.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Vision Pro users can access their YouTube subscriptions, playlists, watch history, and more.<br/>

It was already possible to watch YouTube videos via the Safari browser on the Apple Vision Pro, but there was no official YouTube app on the device until now. A third-party YouTube app called "Juno" was available on visionOS in 2024, but it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/juno-vision-pro-removed-app-store/">quickly removed from the App Store</a> because it was deemed to be violating YouTube's Terms of Service.<br/>
