<p>Corsair just announced the <a href="https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/galleon-100-sd-stream-deck-integrated-mechanical-keyboard-ch-912a31i-na">Galleon 100 SD at CES 2026</a>, a full-size mechanical keyboard with a complete Stream Deck built into it. Rather than a numpad on the right side, you get 12 LCD keys, two rotary dials, and a 5-inch display&#8211;essentially a standalone Stream Deck fused directly into the keyboard frame.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll admit, this is a clever bit of product engineering. The keyboard side is legitimately impressive. </p>



<p>At $350, you&#8217;re getting what would otherwise be a premium gaming keyboard plus roughly a $150 Stream Deck in one package. The math almost works.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I don&#8217;t want my Stream Deck attached to my keyboard.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been using Stream Decks for years. They&#8217;re genuinely useful tools, and I&#8217;ve recommended them repeatedly in my work. But part of what makes them useful is their flexibility.</p>



<p>My Stream Deck sits where I need it, sometimes to my left, sometimes angled toward me, sometimes tucked away entirely. When I&#8217;m writing, I don&#8217;t need macro keys staring at me. When I&#8217;m editing podcasts, I want those controls front and center.</p>



<p>Bolting it to a keyboard removes that flexibility entirely. Now your Stream Deck lives wherever your keyboard lives, at whatever angle your keyboard sits.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a broader trend here worth noting. Keyboards with OLED displays and LCD keys have become increasingly common.</p>



<p>It makes sense that Elgato, now under the Corsair umbrella, would want to get in on this action. The technology has matured, the software ecosystem is already built, and there&#8217;s clearly a market for all-in-one solutions.</p>



<p>I’m sure folks will dig this. Just not me.</p>
