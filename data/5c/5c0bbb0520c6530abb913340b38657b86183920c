<li>They’re waterproof bags that float</li>
<li>Wear it as a backpack or a sling</li>
<li>Big enough for most of your beach essentials</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but if you spill a margarita on one of these, you don’t need to worry about it ruining your phone</li>
</ul><h1>H2-NO</h1><p>Do you have any summer adventures planned?</p>
<p>Maybe a trip to the beach. Maybe a nice hike along the river.</p>
<p>Or shoot, maybe you just want to take a week off to lounge at the local pool or swimming hole.</p>
<p>Point is: a lot of summer adventures mean getting close to some body of water or another. Which is to say nothing of the occasional out-of-nowhere rainstorm that might overtake you while you’re setting up your tent for a long weekend camping trip.</p>
<p>And when you’re on one of these summer adventures, you just want to enjoy the trip, you know?</p>
<p>If the waves splash up against your ankles while you watch the sunset, you want to lose yourself in the moment. You don’t want to be thinking, <em>Yikes, I hope my phone doesn’t get wet</em>, or <em>Oof, it sure would be a disaster if I dropped my wallet into this</em>.</p>
<p>That’s where these bags come in.</p>
<p>They’re not particularly big. They’re not particularly complicated. They’re just bags with basic, adjustable string-straps. And they’re waterproof.</p>
<p>That way, you can shove your phone, ID, debit card, some cash, and a book in one and go about your day without worrying that a bit of water or sand or dirt might get in there and mess stuff up.</p>
<p>The only thing you probably wouldn’t want to put in them would be cans or bottles or anything cold and full of liquid. Because then the condensation would get all over everything, and it would be like, what was the point of a waterproof bag in the first place?</p>
<p>(But if you’re looking to carry some cans or bottles, check out today’s <a href="https://sidedeal.com/daily">SideDeal daily</a>, where we’ve got some nice cooler bags for sale.)</p>
<p>In fact, these are so simple that we don’t really have much to say about them.</p>
<p>So we won’t say anything more about them.</p>
<p>This write-up is over.</p>
