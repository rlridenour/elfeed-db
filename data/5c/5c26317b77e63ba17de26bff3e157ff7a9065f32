<p>France’s government led by Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu survived a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly on Thursday, with 271 lawmakers backing the motion—short of the 289 needed to topple the cabinet [politico.eu#1][france24.com#1][dw.com#1]. A second motion filed by the far right is expected to fail as left-wing lawmakers have said they will not support it, giving the government breathing room after weeks of turbulence [politico.eu#1][dw.com#1]. Lecornu secured crucial Socialist backing by pledging to suspend enforcement of President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reform that raised the retirement age, freezing it until after the 2027 presidential election—a concession that positioned the Socialists as kingmakers [politico.eu#1][reuters.com#1][france24.com#3]. The immediate test now shifts to the 2026 budget: the draft heads to the Finance Committee on Monday, with Lecornu vowing to allow a full parliamentary debate rather than rely on a constitutional shortcut, and the government must still pass a budget by year’s end [politico.eu#1][nytimes.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/oZ-_SYVkhCcpY_jNp0-odmwr5pljE_DeMoM_aKc5Eu-UqPjmlCYh8jMdmckf0sd33DLg1OyQQ8IeSjz9YEt_0QUBlKXYq01vn6jqzQzg1idznXZr7ea-nQSN7jxWCpWUjPZxRptmKIasywV8i3EsIxcbTeCVjaMtRSYtUdOg4aba6u629jFOxvivu54G7OFWfWgwT8cd1o8AHEiJ' alt='Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu speaks before the no-confidence vote at the National Assembly in Paris.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tight arithmetic: Parties publicly committed to ousting Lecornu controlled 265 seats—just 24 short of the threshold—making potential defections a key risk for the government [reuters.com#1].</li><li>Budget pathway: Lawmakers begin detailed work on the 2026 budget Monday in the National Assembly’s Finance Committee, and the prime minister has pledged not to use a constitutional backdoor to force it through [politico.eu#1].</li><li>How suspension works: Lecornu said he would introduce a November amendment to the social security financing law to put the pension reform on ice [reuters.com#1].</li><li>Left-wing split: While Socialists offered critical support, some still intend to back no-confidence motions, citing austerity elements in the 2026 budget proposal [france24.com#2].</li><li>Rapid reset: After his first team resigned last week, Macron reappointed Lecornu on Friday and a new cabinet was named Sunday ahead of this week’s votes [politico.eu#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Socialist Party: The decision to freeze the pension law until 2027 was a significant concession; Socialists declined to support the no-confidence motions, making them pivotal to the outcome.
