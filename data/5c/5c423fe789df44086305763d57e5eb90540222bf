<p>A suicide bomber detonated explosives outside a district and sessions court in Islamabad on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens, officials said. The breakaway militant group Jamaat‑ul‑Ahrar claimed responsibility through its leader Omar Mukkaram Khurasani, according to reporting. Pakistani authorities have opened an investigation into the attack and secured the scene while hospitals treated the wounded. The blast has increased tensions across South Asia after a separate deadly explosion in New Delhi the previous day, prompting parallel probes in both capitals.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/xtSr-LkcVGEvygHqIH8cRdypVQMLVLrCPA355y8VOxTN84J4YDdSsafih8Rph_4_NF04immvGVgn_bl1zvPHfklWZKVytrRJk0JI7DNhqwtbcEcd90xtKTNwyCeDqqyqXPqmE-yG1TT4gmbCfLX510hazUruI4zFl2Hd7LtGievfz6ucYfVigX7U4_ZL8-VNCtEvtj0mh_Gxh_QbFwU' alt='Firefighters at the site of an explosion in Islamabad, Pakistan, on Tuesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Security posture: Pakistan&#x27;s defense minister said the country faced a dramatically heightened threat environment, using language that officials described as indicating a state-level security emergency.</li><li>Historic context: Reporters noted the Islamabad blast was the capital&#x27;s most significant attack in more than a decade, marking a rare direct strike on the city center.</li><li>Accusations and denials: Pakistani leaders publicly suggested foreign involvement in the bombing, a claim New Delhi has rejected as &#x27;baseless&#x27; while Islamabad continues to investigate.</li><li>On-the-ground reports: Witnesses described chaos and heavy emergency response at the court complex, with local media and reporters at the scene documenting rescue efforts and damaged infrastructure.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Jamaat‑ul‑Ahrar (militant group): Jamaat‑ul‑Ahrar claimed responsibility for the suicide attack through its leader, Omar Mukkaram Khurasani, in statements reported by media outlets.
