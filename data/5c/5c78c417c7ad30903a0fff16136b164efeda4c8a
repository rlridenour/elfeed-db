<blockquote><p>
  I’m far more optimistic than I was after WWDC 2024. I don’t expect AI to replace our friends in the indie developer community; far from it. That’s because what sets a great app apart from the pack on the App Store is the care and humanity that’s poured into it. I’ve yet to see a vibe-coded app that comes anywhere close. Those apps will simply join the vast sea of mediocrity that has always made up a big part of the App Store. Instead, I expect AI will help solo developers and small teams tackle bigger problems that were once the exclusive domain of bigger teams with more resources.

<p>I share John’s optimism and <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/06/apple-intelligence-2-0-let-the-apps-flourish/">hope Apple gives app developers even more powers</a> next week. (Dan and I will also be in Cupertino, and like John and Federico, we are looking forward to seeing old friends and meeting new ones!)</p>
