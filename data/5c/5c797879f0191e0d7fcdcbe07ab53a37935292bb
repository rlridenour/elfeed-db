<p>Rights groups and activists say the death toll from Iran’s crackdown on nationwide protests has risen above six thousand, with many others feared dead amid tight information controls. Several outlets report that verifying casualties has been difficult because of restrictions and disruptions to communications, including an internet shutdown and blackout conditions during the unrest. The crisis is also rippling beyond Iran’s streets, as the United States moved major naval assets into the region and announced military drills, raising concerns about escalation even as neighboring Gulf Arab states signal they do not want to be drawn into a conflict.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/cXL92iJKBLmM5VAKizNI_8V_20t_AKUQZ_vHZDZx-8evqcs_lZKrfSbULiMHlfZ8urIvN6wmLywB1a5v51GeAwIGGYSZSyoRDAmWzO_g3FZn8hwDkISfJNrGEoEFZV-1EBtQGcpQCoGz1RxC3TNdqmyhZ8nbCG6gxB3HYBKCEQ9oiKF72AZgE0FppEon9rchotQspBw9cpULZ07qoSEc277ZXx1h_0rXc11uQYKYYrLo-ULPCwdwNLbyHUhDQgh5-Ax9qQdwEr1C5Ag_rw' alt='A billboard in Tehran depicts a U.S. aircraft carrier with a warning message in Farsi and English, Jan. 25, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Public trials: Iran has begun what RFE/RL describes as the first public trial of protesters following mass detentions during the crackdown.</li><li>Currency slide: Iran’s rial fell to a record low of about 1.5 million to $1, according to PBS, underscoring the economic stress alongside the political crisis.</li><li>Regional warning: DW reports an IRGC official warned neighboring countries against helping any strikes on Iran as US warships reached the region.</li><li>Wide-ranging estimates: Euronews reports casualty estimates vary widely—from the low thousands to claims exceeding 30,000—while noting verification remains limited.</li><li>Evidence emerging: The New York Times says videos and witness accounts that trickled out despite a communications blackout describe lethal force used to suppress a civilian uprising.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Activists and human rights monitors: They report the death toll has climbed into the thousands and say many more may be missing or unaccounted for.
