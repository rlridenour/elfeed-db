<p>After <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230904PD216/apple-low-cost-macbook-education-market-chromebook-k-12.html">a 2023 report from Digitimes</a> and <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1939558413459177897">a July 2025 report from Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is joining in on reports that Apple is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-04/apple-readies-a-low-cost-laptop-to-rival-chromebooks-and-windows-pcs?srnd=undefined">planning to release of a low-cost laptop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Apple plans to sell the new machine for well under $1,000 by using less-advanced components. The laptop will rely on an iPhone processor and a lower-end LCD display. The screen will also be the smallest of any current Mac, coming in at slightly below the 13.6-inch one used in the MacBook Air.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Gurman says Apple expects to release the laptop in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>As I wrote <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/07/about-that-a16-macbook-rumor/">when dissecting Kuo’s report back in July</a>, the rumored “iPhone processor” driving this Mac might be an A18 Pro, which would offer comparable performance to the M1 processor still being sold in the MacBook Air at Walmart:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The A18 Pro is 46% faster than the M1 in single-core tasks, and almost identical to the M1 on multi-core and graphics tasks. If you wanted to get rid of the M1 MacBook Air but have decided that even today, its performance characteristics make it perfectly suitable as a low-cost Mac laptop, building a new model on the A18 Pro would not be a bad move. It wouldn’t have Thunderbolt, only USB-C, but that’s not a dealbreaker on a cheap laptop. It might reuse parts from the M1 Air, including the display.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Gurman’s mention of a lower-end LCD display sounds an awful lot like the M1 Air’s 13.3-inch display. I continue to wonder if this low-cost laptop is going to be more or less the M1 Air with a slightly more modern processor.</p>
