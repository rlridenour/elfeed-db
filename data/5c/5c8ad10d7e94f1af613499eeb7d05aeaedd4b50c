The iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.4 updates that Apple released today include a long list of fixes for security vulnerabilities, though none of the issues addressed were known to have been actively exploited.<br/>

iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 fix 60 vulnerabilities, including an issue that could allow sensitive keychain data to be accessible from an iOS backup, a problem where password autofill filled a password even after a failed authentication, and a bug that could allow hidden photos to be viewed without authentication.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has a full list of iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 fixes in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122371">security support document</a>. There's a separate security support document <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122373">for macOS Sequoia 15.4</a>, and the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.4 update addresses over 120 vulnerabilities with everything from AirDrop and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> to the Dock and Kernel.<br/>

Because iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.4 fix so many vulnerabilities, it is a good idea to update as soon as possible even if there were no known instances of these security holes being used in the wild.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/ios-18-4-security-fixes/">iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 Address 50+ Vulnerabilities</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-ipados-18-4-and-macos-sequoia-15-4-address-50-vulnerabilities.2454390/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
