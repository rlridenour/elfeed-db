<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 5 1-year subscriptions to Bear Pro ($29.99 value each) for <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>. That&rsquo;s right, another chance at Bear! Bear is a great app for note taking, journaling, and organizing information with Markdown support. It&rsquo;s gorgeous to work with, elegant in its functionality, and even works great with <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a> for all your export needs.</p>

<blockquote>
