Last year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">launched CarPlay Ultra</a>, the long-awaited next-generation version of its CarPlay software system for vehicles. Nearly nine months later, CarPlay Ultra is still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/first-look-at-carplay-ultra/">limited to Aston Martin's latest luxury vehicles</a>, but that should change fairly soon.<br/>

In May 2025, Apple said many other vehicle brands planned to offer CarPlay Ultra, including Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis. At the time, it said CarPlay Ultra would begin expanding to more vehicles around the world "in the next 12 months."<br/>
<br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-01/apple-s-record-quarter-and-ai-changes-macbook-pro-update-clamshell-iphone-fold"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said he was told that CarPlay Ultra will come to at least one major new Hyundai or Kia vehicle model "in the second half of this year." It is unclear if he is referring to Hyundai's upcoming IONIQ 3, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/31/next-carplay-ultra-vehicle-report/">previously reported</a>, or if it will be a different model. <br/>
<br/>
CarPlay Ultra features deeper integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster and systems, built-in apps for radio and climate controls, rear-view camera feed support, and more. The connected iPhone provides app-related data, while the vehicle provides information like the current speed, fuel level, tire pressure, engine temperature, and more.<br/>

The interface is tailored to each vehicle model and automaker's identity, and drivers can choose from various preset design options.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/24/bmw-confirms-no-plans-to-offer-carplay-ultra/">BMW</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/29/ford-ceo-provides-update-on-carplay-ultra/">Ford</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/06/rivian-ceo-doubles-down-on-skipping-carplay/">Rivian</a> are among the brands that have publicly downplayed CarPlay Ultra, while General Motors controversially ditched the regular version of CarPlay <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/gm-further-explains-phasing-out-carplay/">in its new electric vehicles</a>, so it is likely to pass on CarPlay Ultra too. That means vehicles from brands like Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC are likely out of the running.<br/>
<br/>
It is improbable that Tesla would offer CarPlay Ultra either, but it is reportedly working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/13/tesla-to-add-carplay-support/">offering the regular version of CarPlay</a> in a major pivot.<br/>
