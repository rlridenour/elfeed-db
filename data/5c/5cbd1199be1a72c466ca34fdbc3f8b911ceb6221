As noted <a href="https://x.com/zollotech/status/1948171482674155850">by Aaron Zollo</a>, Apple on Wednesday re-labeled iOS 18.6 Beta 4 as simply iOS 18.6, meaning that it is the Release Candidate version. This change effectively confirms that the update will be released to the public next week.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the new label, Apple shared release notes for iOS 18.6, which is a minor update focused on bug fixes and security patches. One of the fixes is for an issue that prevented sharing <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/iphone/iph1a5832438/ios">memory movies</a> in the Photos app, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
"This update provides important bug fixes and security updates, and fixes an issue in Photos that could prevent memory movies from being shared," the release notes say.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.6 should be released to the public early next week, and iOS 18.7 will likely follow in September with additional security patches.<br/>
