<p style="text-align: left;">The <a href="https://www.apaonline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Philosophical Association</a> (APA) has been experimenting with holding one of its three major conferences <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/02/04/this-year-the-central-apa-comes-to-you-guest-post/">entirely online</a>. The organization has now announced that, after the second of these online-only events&#8212;the Pacific Division meeting taking place this April&#8212;it will go back to holding all three meetings in person.<span id="more-56222"></span></p>

<p>Amy Ferrer, executive director of the APA, along with the Secretary Treasurers of the three divisions, Andy Cullison (Eastern), Alex Sager (Pacific), and Ariela Tubert (Central), said in an announcement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Throughout the planning of both of these online meetings, APA leadership has been closely monitoring the results of the experiment—interest and participation in the meetings, effectiveness of and engagement in sessions, effectiveness of the technology for presentations and networking, participant feedback, resources required to organize and host the meeting, financial outcomes, and more.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The results of the experiment so far show that interest and participation in the online meetings are significantly lower than for in-person meetings—for example, paper submission numbers for both online meetings were just over half of the number of submissions usually received for in-person meetings. Participation in the online sessions was also significantly lower than for in-person meetings (in other words, session audiences were smaller online than in person). The process of organizing an online meeting is more challenging for the program committee than organizing an in-person meeting, online meetings are more taxing on APA staff, and the technology for large online meetings is often difficult for participants to navigate. And perhaps most telling, participant feedback on the Central Division meeting indicates that while many people appreciate that the online format may be more accessible for some people, a large number report that they personally would not participate in another online meeting.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Taking this information into account, the three divisions have determined that it is untenable to continue to organize divisional meetings in an entirely online format. </em></p>
<p>The experiment with online meetings was <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/08/16/campaign-move-apa-meetings-online/">prompted</a> largely by a <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/08/23/apa-responds-to-campaign-to-move-some-of-its-meetings-online/">campaign</a> by <a href="https://www.philosophersforsustainability.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philosophers for Sustainability</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement acknowledges that environmental and accessibility concerns about in-person meetings remain, and states that there are plans to develop other kinds of online programming and meetings:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The divisions and the board of officers recognize that the motivations for initiating the 2+1 experiment—primarily climate impact and accessibility—remain, and the APA will continue to pursue those goals in other ways. In particular, we remain committed to developing programming that serves those who cannot or prefer not to participate in in-person divisional meetings. Pivoting from its original plan for an online divisional meeting, the Eastern Division executive committee will work with the board of officers, the other divisions, and the APA staff to develop a different kind of online conference—something specifically designed to work well in the online format. This online conference will likely be smaller, held at a different time of year than the divisional meetings, and incorporate the best elements of the online divisional meetings (such as watch parties) and best practices from other online events. More information about this future online conference will be announced as it becomes available.</em></p>
