<p>President Donald Trump’s administration has revoked the US Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 “endangerment finding”—the scientific determination that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, and the core legal foundation for federal climate regulations under the Clean Air Act. The administration paired the move with eliminating federal greenhouse-gas standards for automobiles, including rules described as covering model years 2012 through 2027, according to reports. The White House and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin cast the decision as sweeping deregulation they say will cut costs and red tape, and supportive coverage highlighted claims of large projected savings. Critics—including former President Barack Obama—said the shift dismisses established science and could weaken protections tied to vehicle pollution and potentially other sectors. Multiple outlets also said legal challenges are likely to follow quickly. Outside the US, some coverage pointed to broader global implications, including new uncertainty over how the United States—a major historical contributor to greenhouse-gas emissions—will pursue emissions cuts.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/vFShuppbVhy-CEYjOktoTBmIcVsGpwunO94Egu45wTbuflym5LizV9IqD9BEwszg_dXwbXL8-nPmkO_yPexLgqN8cGpTms45PBILLRVPljihb-5xSL33WT95ASaxA_1wPk_92_zz7r6UsXcFOSl34TdugZ0TBlCuVckw2P3VOxKOVOzc8teUSjizQaQ-Y-AjnBt1I_xbX8fJeXfqVk0E-kcjBXuLNwcx0-rVwuJZMBeKJZuaeV7L9YOTuz2WRqK1KNwwHKQXapeae60jcQ' alt='U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to announce a rollback of the 2009 endangerment finding at the White House on February 12, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>What’s at stake: The 2009 finding underpins multiple EPA rules, so repealing it could also put other climate regulations—such as limits on power-plant carbon dioxide and oil-and-gas methane leaks—on shakier ground, according to coverage of possible knock-on effects.</li><li>Administration rationale: President Trump said the endangerment finding “severely damaged the American auto industry” and raised consumer prices, describing the rollback as pro-industry and pro-consumer.</li><li>Legal fights ahead: Coverage said challengers are expected to argue the EPA has not cleared the scientific and administrative-law hurdles needed to undo a major Clean Air Act predicate finding, making court-ordered pauses or reversals a key near-term battleground.</li><li>Political reaction: Obama condemned the repeal as undermining public-health protections and worsening climate risks, reflecting the broader partisan split over how federal agencies should use greenhouse-gas science in regulation.</li><li>Claims disputed: Some outlets and online discussion focused on disputing the administration’s claims about the repeal, underscoring how misinformation and accuracy debates may run alongside the regulatory fight.</li></ul><blockquote>Less safe, less healthy - Barack Obama</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House and EPA (Trump administration): President Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the repeal a historic deregulatory step and a cost-cutting move, arguing it reduces “red tape” and helps consumers and industry.
