<p>Canadian-born American architect Frank Gehry, whose sculptural buildings transformed city skylines from Bilbao to Los Angeles and made him one of the few architects to achieve global celebrity status, has died at his home in Santa Monica at the age of 96 after a brief respiratory illness. He became widely known for bold forms, jagged angles and shimmering metal façades in projects such as the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain, the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. Gehry received every major architecture prize, including the Pritzker Prize, whose jury praised his work as &quot;refreshingly original and totally American&quot; while he continued working well into his 90s. Born Ephraim Owen Goldberg in Toronto, he moved to the United States as a teenager and later changed his name after his first wife suggested that his Jewish surname might be limiting his career prospects amid antisemitism in the profession.</p><img src='' alt='Frank Gehry&#x27;s best-known buildings, including Guggenheim Bilbao and Walt Disney Concert Hall, featured in a global retrospective photo gallery.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Signature buildings: Among Gehry&#x27;s most recognised works are the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, and the Dancing House in Prague, each helping turn its host city into a major cultural attraction for visitors.</li><li>Materials and style: He became famous for using industrial materials such as titanium, stainless steel and corrugated metal in swirling, fragmented forms that challenged conventional box-like buildings and aligned with influences from modern pop art.</li><li>Early life path: Gehry worked in his grandparents&#x27; hardware store in Toronto before moving with his family to Los Angeles as a teenager, later studying architecture at the University of Southern California and urban planning at Harvard.</li><li>Cultural crossover: His fame extended beyond architecture into popular culture, with appearances on television shows and commissions from major brands, reflecting how his visually striking buildings resonated with a broad global audience.</li><li>Jewish heritage: The architect, who was born to a Jewish family and maintained ties to Jewish cultural life, designed projects for Jewish institutions and once noted that his name change did not alter his sense of identity.</li></ul><blockquote>Refreshingly original and totally American - Pritzker Prize jury (quoted in coverage of Gehry&#x27;s award)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pritzker Prize jury: The Pritzker Prize jury described Gehry&#x27;s work as &quot;refreshingly original and totally American&quot; when honouring him with the field&#x27;s highest distinction.
