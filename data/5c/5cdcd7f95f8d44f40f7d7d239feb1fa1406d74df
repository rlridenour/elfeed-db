<p>
If you&#39;re using Beancount with Emacs, you may be using <a href="https://github.com/beancount/beancount-mode">beancount-mode</a>. It can auto-complete the accounts defined in the current buffer when we are typing in new transactions so that we can do it more efficiently.</p>
<p>
But it can <strong><strong>only</strong></strong> auto-complete the accounts from the current buffer, which makes it less useful when we have a stand-alone file or a few files of beancount accounts.</p>
