<p>In the latest development, protests driven by Iran’s worsening economic conditions have expanded across the country into a second week, with reports of violent clashes and an intensified security crackdown in multiple cities and provinces. Rights groups cited by several outlets report dozens of deaths and large-scale detentions, while Iranian authorities have not published comprehensive nationwide tallies. The unrest has also drawn sharper external pressure and rhetoric, including renewed warnings from President Trump about potential U.S. action if peaceful protesters are killed and reports that Israel has approved a new plan for possible strikes on Tehran.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qTEdnXXZpM_P2oCCS3oZN6q_N2l4Ekd0M8A-68nfQVi5dxhATJzTTVDOKasVGlAaPgO24GC3WYLgxuvVcF504UjS-PQM2Hrhe3QVDKkkKP8CtDsKXTvYZWmuqaz2RMGHaVrDT8woQOWmw_a_lUhGh__Z4NfHrEzCLbIcU2uB0Q46_mY0LuxJAzq1rTUVOzSflxIgFKWOe6w' alt='An image taken from social media shows Iranian security forces using tear gas to disperse protesters at the Tehran bazaar on Tuesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Bazaar shutdowns: Some of Iran’s bazaars and commercial centers have shuttered as part of the protest momentum, a sign of economic actors joining street demonstrations.</li><li>Kurdish strike: Kurdish opposition parties based in neighboring Iraq have called for a general strike in support of the protest movement, according to France 24 and witness accounts cited by The Guardian.</li><li>Currency plunge: Iran’s rial has fallen to roughly 1.4 million to the U.S. dollar, accelerating inflation and making basic goods harder to afford for many households.</li><li>Detention scale: The Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported more than 2,000 arrests across more than 200 locations spanning 26 of Iran’s 31 provinces.</li><li>Different dynamic: The Christian Science Monitor argues the demonstrations reflect a “new moral order” centered on dignity that has gradually eroded the authorities’ perceived legitimacy, distinguishing this wave from prior unrest.</li></ul><blockquote>We are locked and loaded and ready to go. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iranian judiciary: Judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said there would be “no leniency” for people he accused of aiding Iran’s enemies, portraying the unrest as foreign-backed.
