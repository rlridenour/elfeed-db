<p>The U.S. Senate voted 60–40 to pass a stopgap funding bill that would end the 41-day government shutdown and send the measure to the House of Representatives for final approval and the president’s signature. The vote followed weeks of stalemate and negotiations, with some Democrats breaking ranks after demanding Republican talks on extending health-care tax credits. The shutdown has left more than a million federal workers unpaid and disrupted government services, contributing to major flight cancellations and other operational problems.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DDEa_vY1hXR2MJ6jtec9QqURgPLKcUwh3MtJHjQlh2K2lluwg2yKiEQwI1_We_M3fpDKfC1-fBANUnOui-PZrTVYVDkp6WBT0Uzw4nq7cFT7Y9xihWEjX2eoil267oAG2HlZp_NFNmZnnetgLeBiWdszmhxiiRhFe-zl8PdeK670xhf1nRu8DmXguV4oSapYVvJ53UMeYGmi0eFUaFYLFMcOAfcv1doHRRQ3jADISomuQVXmJAouCi58fTpcxrvQbGgu_f3KR56nVVQ70Q' alt='U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer looks down during a press conference following a Senate vote on Monday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Funding window: The Senate package would extend government funding through January 30, 2026, if approved and signed into law.</li><li>Party backlash: Several Democratic senators who voted for the bill faced immediate criticism from party leaders and parts of their base for not securing an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits.</li><li>House timeline: House leaders signaled members could return from recess quickly, and the chamber could vote as soon as Wednesday to clear the package for the president.</li><li>Market reaction: U.S. markets moved higher on news the shutdown could end, with traders responding to reduced near-term fiscal uncertainty.</li></ul><blockquote>What happened tonight is not the closing of a chapter.
