Strategic management is one of the most discussed issues in business studies. But what is strategy and does it improve business performance? This essay examines the relationship between strategic management and serendipity in light of strategic management studies.</p>
<p>
Life is characterised by serendipity, and much of human culture is, in essence, a means to deal with the unpredictable. We can not know whether the next harvest will fail, whether we still have a job next year or whether we will die. Ancient systems, such as astrology and other forms of divination were developed to reduce uncertainty in people&#39;s lives.</p>
<p>
After the era of enlightenment, divination was replaced by science, and we now rely on weather forecasters, medical professionals, engineers and other professionals to provide information to help us plan our lives.</p>
<p>
What is valid for life, in general, is also adequate for managing an organisation. An organisation is a group of people that are bound together through a common goal. To increase the likelihood that organisations achieve objectives, they require management, i.e. actions of members of the organisation aimed at reducing uncertainty. One of the most significant uncertainties in business is the existence of competitors and their intrinsic unpredictable actions. Strategic management is a specific kind of management that seeks to reduce this uncertainty.</p>

Strategic Management Schools of Thought
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The distinction between prescriptive theories, such as those propounded
by Igor Ansoff and Michael Porter, and descriptive schools of strategic
thinking are discussed. It is argued that an organisation can not rely
solely on formal, prescriptive systems to develop and implement strategy
and that an integrated approach is required to act strategically and
increase the chances of success.</p>
<p>
Socially constructed phenomena, such as religion, culture and management
are notoriously hard to define. This fact is undoubtedly the case for
business strategy, and although many scholars have applied their
intellect to this problem, no consensus has thus far emerged (Forster
and Browne 1996; Mintzberg 1987). The most productive approach has been
to move away from essentialist “strategy is …” type definitions that
attempt to capture strategy in one quintessential sentence. Mintzberg
(1987) criticises the reductionist approach to strategy definition by
comparing it with a group of blind scientists describing an elephant by
touch alone. One says it is a trunk, the other might focus on the legs,
but nobody is able is to describe the elephant as a whole. To circumvent
perceived issues with essentialist definitions, a phenomenological view,
characterising different perspectives of strategic thinking in a model
or taxonomy is preferred.</p>
<p>
Several authors have proposed systems to classify strategic approaches
for business. For example, Igor Ansoff (1987) defined a matrix of four
generic strategies and Michael Porter (1980) described three generic
strategies to achieve competitive advantage.</p>
<p>
Igor Ansoff, often credited as the Father of Strategic Management,
started his career as a mathematician and later moved into the field of
management (Hussey 1999). Mintzberg credits Ansoff as being instrumental
in the development of the Planning School (Mintzberg and Lampel 1999).
Being trained as a mathematician, it is not surprising that Ansoff&#39;s
strategic thinking revolved around structure and order. The subtitle of
the first edition of Corporate Strategy was “An analytic approach to
business policy for growth and expansion” (Ansoff 1987). The process of
strategy formulation is, according to Ansoff, not a creative activity
but a formal one, consisting of distinct steps supported by checklists
and other control techniques (Mintzberg and Lampel 1999). Ansoff
published a great deal on turbulent and discontinuous change (Hussey 1999). 
But Ansoff, thinking like a mathematician, sought to control the
unpredictability of the external environment with checklists, budgets
and operating plans. The reality he thus tried to control is, however,
not physical and predictable, but social and therefore less likely to be
controllable through analytic means.</p>
<p>
Almost two decades after Ansoff published his first ideas on strategic
management, Michael Porter came on the scene and quickly attained the
status of management guru. In his book Competitive Strategies, Porter
(1980) argues that only three strategies exist which provide
opportunities for success. The differences between these strategies are
in the strategic advantage sought from either cost or differentiation
and the target aimed at (Speed 1989). Mintzberg and Lampel (1999) place
the work of Porter in the Positioning School, a prescriptive view on
strategy popular in the 1980s. In Porter&#39;s view, a strategy can be
reduced to a generic position taking based on a formal analysis of the
external environment. Because of the intuitive appeal of Porter&#39;s work,
it quickly picked up by management consultants, who proclaimed it to be
a scientific truth (Mintzberg and Lampel 1999). One often heard
criticism of Porter&#39;s work is, however, that it lacks empirical support,
using selective case studies to make his point (Speed 1989).</p>
<p>
Henry Mintzberg employs a more philosophical approach when he classifies
strategic business thinking in ten Schools of Thought, which
he describes in their historical and ideological context. Early
theorists, such as Igor Ansoff, focused on the analytical aspects of
strategy formation. The first three schools in Mintzberg&#39;s taxonomy are
therefore prescriptive and focus on how strategy ought to be formulated.
One of the major premises of the prescriptive schools is the Performance
Claim, which states that the more an organisation engages in systematic
strategic planning, the more likely it will result in above average
returns. The prescriptive schools have been influential in the discourse
of strategy formulation, but have failed to explain the process of
strategy execution (Mintzberg 1990).</p>
<p>
Later developments in strategic management literature moved away from
the prescriptive approaches modelled on the quantitative sciences and
their inherent presumption of a controllable world. The descriptive
schools of thought are inspired by the qualitative social and cultural
sciences and study what businesses did to be successful for other
organisations to learn from their approaches. The descriptive schools
move from a focus on apriori strategic planning to a-posteriori dynamic
strategy formulation and execution.</p>
<p>
For practitioners, the prescriptive schools of thought are desirable,
illustrated by the ubiquity of tools such as SWOT analysis and generic
strategies, such as those developed by Ansoff (1987) and Porter (1980).
The descriptive schools are somewhat problematic for practitioners of
strategic management because they do not provide straightforward recipes
for success. Analogous to the Naturalistic Fallacy in moral philosophy,
where an ought cannot be derived from an is, the descriptive schools
(strategy as an is) are not very suitable for managers to determine what
strategic decision ought to be made. The question raised by Mintzberg&#39;s
taxonomy of strategic thought and other similar taxonomies is how
average practitioners can decide which strategy they should employ.</p>

Strategic Management and Serendipity
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>One of the major premises of the prescriptive schools of strategic
management thought is the Performance Claim, which can be formally
expressed as (Hill et al. 2004: 23):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strategic planning, on average, has a positive impact on company performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Miller and Cardinal (1994) investigated how firm size, capital intensity
and environmental turbulence influences performance in firms with
different degrees of formal strategic planning. They found that
correlations between planning and business results show a relatively
large fluctuation (-0.30 &lt; r<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.71), but are skewed towards
positive performance. They also concluded that stronger
planning-profitability correlations emerge when firms face turbulent
environments (Miller and Cardinal 1994). Rogers et al. (1999)
investigated whether the relationship between strategic planning
processes and organisational performance depends on the content of the
strategy pursued and not just the extent of planning. They concluded
that formal strategic planning positively influences company
performance, as expressed in the Performance Claim. Miller and Cardinal
(1994) also support the Performance Claim but argue that companies
typically only realise 63% of the potential value of their strategy
because of defects in planning and execution. They provide a list of
possible causes of performance loss but do not seem to recognise that
unpredictable events can negatively influence performance and imply that
any strategy can be realised, as long as planned and executed
appropriately.</p>
<p>
However, some academics question the idea that formal strategic planning
systems are a sufficient condition to improve company performance and
argue that luck and serendipity play a critical role in determining
competitive advantage (Mintzberg 1979; Hart 1992; Hamel 1996). This
criticism is supported by the fact that that the prescriptive view of
strategy formation contains a logical inconsistency. In prescriptive
schools, a strategy is often defined as the actions a company takes to
attain superior performance (Hill et al. 2004). However, when a strategy
is thus defined, the Performance Claim becomes a tautology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actions taken to attain superior performance, on average, have a positive impact on company performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another issue with prescriptive schools of thought is the presumed
causality from plan to action to succeed. The definition of strategy
discussed above expresses an intent (“Actions taken to attain …”).
This intent does, however, not imply a causal link between planning
action and success. Hamel (1996) argues that strategic planning, as
practised in business management, is not strategic at all. He claims
that strategy development tends to be a reductionist process, based on
simple rules and heuristics, working from the present to the future,
rather than the other way around. The strategic planning process is
largely extrapolative, and it is assumed that the future will resemble
the past, an assumption that David Hume has shown to be irrational. 
Hamel, therefore, emphasises the creative
aspects of strategic management and points out that it is not a rote
process that can be instrumentalised in neat systems, such as SWOT
diagrams and generic strategies. A strategy is in the view of Hamel
(1996: 71) a “quest that must be a subversive revolution to improve
company performance”.</p>
<p>
Logical analysis of the principles of the prescriptive schools of
strategic thought shows them to be invalid because the Performance Claim
is tautological. However, the empirical fact of the Performance Claim
holds at least some truth remains. This seeming contradiction emerges
because the relationship between planning and organisational success is
more complicated than was assumed in the research. Firstly, the analysis
only used companies still in existence, leaving out those that did
employ strategic planning but failed. Secondly, without conducting fully
controlled studies, it is near impossible to prove causality between
planning and success. A positive correlation does not imply that
planning is the cause of a good business result.</p>
<p>
Hart (1992) summarises the discourse between proponents of strict formal
planning and those that stress the limits of this approach. He refers to
formal planning as the rational model for strategy formulation. The
rational model advocates to consider all available alternatives,
identify and evaluate all of the consequences of each alternative and
then select the preferred choice. Researchers challenging this approach
argue that organisations can achieve only limited rationality because of
individual cognitive limits, heuristics and biases in human judgement
(Forster and Browne 1996).</p>
<p>
The process of strategy formation is, according to Mintzberg (1979), the
interplay between the formal intended strategies and informal emergent
strategies, mediated by leadership. What he emphasises is that strategy
is not a fixed plan, nor does it change systematically at prearranged
times at the will of management. Mintzberg also emphasises the
unpredictability of the external environment. An organisation can find
itself in a stable environment for long periods of time, without the
need to change its strategy. Sometimes the environment can, however,
become so turbulent that even the best planning techniques are useless
because of the high level of unpredictability (Mintzberg 1979). This
seems to contradict the finding of Miller and Cardinal (1994) that
stronger planning-profitability correlations emerge when firms face
turbulent environments. This is not unexpected as those companies that
succumbed to the turbulent environment were not included in the
research. This leaves the question of whether to follow prescriptive or
descriptive schools of thought open. The most productive answer is that
strategic management is a complex synergy of apriori intended and
a-posteriori emergent strategy and positive company performance are
brought about by a combination of both. Thus, although formal planning
is not a sufficient condition to obtain superior company performance, it
is most certainly a necessary condition.</p>
<p>
Research into strategy formulation has resulted in a plethora of
strategic management theories. The fundamental differences between
individual theories and the fact that they come and go in quick
succession support the claim that there is no firm scientific basis for
theories of management (Miller and Cardinal 1994). Strategic management
theory is an eclectic field with contributions from military history,
engineering, industrial economics, organisational sociology,
behavioural, cognitive and social psychology, anthropology and political
science (Forster and Browne 1996). Strategic management is thus more
aligned with social sciences than the exact sciences and as such needs a
methodology that suits the unpredictability of human behaviour, rather
than a rational model, feigning predictability.</p>
<p>
Management deals with human beings and their social interaction and both
the external and internal environment are in a constant state of flux. A
strategy will only improve performance if its formulation takes the
fundamental unpredictability of the world into account. A strategy
cannot be formulated through rational systems that model the real world.
Formulating strategy is a continuously developing narrative between the
organisation and the external environment.</p>
<p>
Strategic planning as a means to reduce uncertainty in organisations is
a young science in which many different perspectives have been explored.
Following a taxonomy based on descriptive and prescriptive strategic
management, it has been shown that a formal planning approach by itself
can not cause a company to achieve above-average returns.</p>
<p>
Although empirical research points towards a positive correlation
between strategic planning and company performance, these studies suffer
from methodological problems. This problem does, however, not imply that
strategic planning as a formal exercise is futile. Formal strategic
planning is vital for prudent management. Not as a means to define the
course for years ahead, but as a way to be able to anticipate the
unpredictability of external influences.</p>
