<blockquote>
  <p>President Trump’s nomination of Heritage Foundation economist E.J.
Antoni to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday drew
criticism from economists across the political spectrum. <em>Why it
matters</em>: The growing negative consensus among conservative
economists is unusual given Antoni’s own conservative pedigree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we go with “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/11/unusual-agreements">unusual</a>” as a euphemism for “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/11/quid-pro-quo-financial-times">unprecedented</a>” — or perhaps, most accurately, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/11/mad-king-watch-intel">crazy</a>” — again. The dichotomy here is that Trump and MAGA have flipped what “conservative” means in US politics. Some legitimate economists are left-leaning, some are right-leaning. It’s a field of study, like the law, that attracts from across the political spectrum. But all legitimate economists believe in trying to objectively measure the economy. MAGA kooks have overrun Republican elected politics, but not so with economics. So of course legitimate conservative economists are objecting to Trump’s nomination of <a href="https://www.heritage.org/staff/ej-antoni-phd">this guy Antoni</a>, who both is a crackpot kook <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/11/30/the-paranoid-style">of the paranoid style</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/ej-antoni.jpeg">looks like one</a>, with crazy eyes and, of all things, a devil beard.</p>

<p>To the commentary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Antoni’s “work at Heritage has frequently included elementary
errors or nonsensical choices that all bias his findings in the
same partisan direction,” Stan Veuger, a senior fellow at the
conservative American Enterprise Institute, told Axios’ Courtenay
Brown and Emily Peck.</p>

<p>Dave Hebert, an economist at the conservative American Institute
for Economic Research, <a href="https://x.com/dave_hebert/status/1955054062325444659?s=42">wrote in a post on X</a> that he’s
worked with Antoni before and implored the Senate to block the
nomination. “I’ve been on several programs with him at this point
and have been impressed by two things: his inability to
understand basic economics and the speed with which he’s gone
MAGA,” Hebert said. [...]</p>

<p>Jessica Riedl, a senior Manhattan Institute fellow, shared another
example from X, in which Antoni appeared not to know that the BLS’
measure of import prices did not account for the impact of
tariffs. “The articles and tweets I’ve seen him publish are
probably the most error-filled of any think tank economist right
now,” she <a href="https://x.com/jessicabriedl/status/1955044169598242849?s=42">wrote</a>. “I hope we see better at BLS.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the take on Antoni from <em>conservative</em> economists.</p>
