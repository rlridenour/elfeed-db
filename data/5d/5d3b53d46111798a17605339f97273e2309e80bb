After this morning's announcement of Apple's upcoming iPhone-centric event on September 9, Apple has added an event placeholder to its YouTube channel.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="1407" height="668" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H3KnMyojEQU" title="Apple Event — September 9" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Apple will stream the "Awe Dropping" event on YouTube, on its <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events website</a>, and in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app, so there are multiple ways to watch it.<br/>
<br/>
YouTube users can click on the video placeholder and select the "Notify me" option to get a notification when the livestream is up. There's also an included countdown.<br/>
<br/>
If YouTube has your location information, the notification and countdown will be displayed in local time, which makes it a good way to double check when you will need to tune in to watch the event. Apple's events are almost always at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, which is 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, evening in Europe, and early morning in countries in Asia and Australia.<br/>
<br/>
The dedicated Apple Events website also has an option to add the event to your calendar for a cross-platform reminder.<br/>
