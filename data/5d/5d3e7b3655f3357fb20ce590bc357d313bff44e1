As I was driving to work this morning, the person behind me honked as I was waiting for a pedestrian to cross the street at a marked crosswalk. I was still fuming and telling myself that I wish I could have told them what I really thought as they pulled into the parking space beside me. Fortunately, I had just heard Mitch Randall’s sermon on Daniel in the lions’ den the day before. With that said, here is the prayer for the week:
</p>

 <p>
Lord,
</p>

 <p>
It seems like I’m always in the lions’ den.
</p>

 <p>
I tell myself that I’m Daniel, <br></br>
a man of faith who was slandered by the envious, <br></br>
the righteous one who was unjustly attacked by his enemies.
</p>

 <p>
I can fool myself, Lord, <br></br>
but surely I’m not fooling you.
</p>

 <p>
Most of the time, <br></br>
I’m one of the lions. <br></br>
Ready at any time to open my mouth <br></br>
to tear down, <br></br>
to hurt, <br></br>
to wound, <br></br>
to destroy.
</p>

 <p>
And when I lack the ability to shut my own mouth, <br></br>
please shut it for me, <br></br>
until it’s filled with words <br></br>
that proclaim <br></br>
justice, <br></br>
healing, <br></br>
mercy, <br></br>
and love.
</p>

 <p>
Then, loosen my lips, <br></br>
so that the stream of mercy and love <br></br>
can flow from you, through me, <br></br>
and transform the lions’ den <br></br>
into a sanctuary of your grace.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
