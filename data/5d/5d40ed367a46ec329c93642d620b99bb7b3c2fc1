I love strewing ideas in front of A+ in case
something catches her interest. A rich source of
in-jokes is the word
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidisestablishmentarianism_(word)">antidisestablishmentarianism</a>", which I introduced
to her when she was&#x2026; what&#x2026; maybe 3? 4? and
which she decided to master with her usual
determination. Sometimes, when she's in a "Mom!
Mom! Mom!" phase, I joke about changing my
preferred name so that she has to say
"Antidisestablishmentarianism!
Antidisestablishmentarianism!
Antidisestablishmentarianism!", which always gets
either a laugh or a groan.
</p>

<p>
One of A+'s friends is a 4-year-old. She was
playing the copying game with her, the one where a
kid repeats everything the other person says.
Whenever A+ wants to wind the game down, she
confidently rattles off
"antidisestablishmentarianism" and that's the end
of that.
</p>

<p>
I didn't want A+ to rest on her laurels, of
course. I introduced another word:
paradichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. That piqued
A+'s curiosity, so I told her about DDT and I
shared the <a href="http://wonderingminstrels.blogspot.com/2001/06/mosquito-was-heard-to-complain-dr-d-d.html?showComment=1123254474000#c912334426462592003">limerick</a> I learned it from.
</p>

<p class="verse">
A mosquito was heard to complain,<br>
"A chemist has poisoned my brain!"<br>
The source of his sorrow<br>
was paradichloro-<br>
diphenyltrichloroethane.<br>
</p>

<p>
A+ got the hang of the limerick within a few days.
Apparently, she's already shared it with her
teacher and her nature club counselors. I think
she's even been coaching the 4-year-old through
saying it syllable by syllable, so perhaps there
will be two of these word geeks someday.
</p>

<p>
Since A+ liked the rhythm of the limerick and she
also likes math, I looked up this other fun
limerick, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_Mercer">attributed to Leigh Mercer</a>:
</p>

<p class="verse">
A dozen, a gross, and a score<br>
Plus three times the square root of four<br>
Divided by seven<br>
Plus five times eleven<br>
Is nine squared and not a bit more.<br>
</p>

<p>
Small words, but fun to play with too.
</p>

<p>
For our next steps, I want to get the hang of
saying
"pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis"
and "hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia"
(although sesquipedalophobia is the more common
term).
</p>

<p>
We also pun about whatever she's interested in. At
the moment, it's all red panda all the time,
thanks to her enjoyment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Red">Turning Red</a>. ("Which
animal loves books?" "A well-read panda!") We love
alliteration and rhyme. We change the lyrics to
her favourite songs. I had a hard time sitting
down and playing with A+ when she was smaller, but
now we've got so many words to play with. This is fun!
</p>

<p>
What's the use of these things? Mostly to tickle
our brains and make each other smile, but also
maybe the tiny chance of bumping into someone else
who happens to overhear it and who chuckles out of
recognition. There are people out there who like
to play the kind of way we like to play, and
she'll find her tribe someday.</p>
