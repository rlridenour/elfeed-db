The M5 chip has up to a 10-core CPU, with four performance cores and six efficiency cores. It features a next-generation GPU with Neural Accelerator in each core, allowing the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; to deliver up to 3.5x the AI performance than the previous model, and a third-generation ray-tracing engine. A faster 16-core Neural Engine also delivers more energy-efficient performance. Apple says that performance gains and breakthrough improvements over iPads with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip are "staggering".<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the M5 chip, the cellular versions of the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; feature Apple's custom-designed C1X modem, which allows up to 50% faster cellular data performance than its predecessor, with much greater efficiency. <br/>

It also features the N1 chip, a new Apple-designed wireless networking chip that enables Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Apple says the N1 brings better performance when connected to 5GHz networks, and improves the overall performance and reliability of features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop.<br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; features over 150GB/s of unified memory bandwidth, which is almost a 30% increase compared to the previous generation. It also offers up to 2x faster storage read and write speeds, and the 256GB and 512GB models start with 12GB of unified memory.<br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; adds the ability to drive external displays at up to 120Hz and now supports Adaptive Sync, which provides the lowest possible latency in external display performance.<br/>
<br/>
Fast charging is now supported, allowing the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; to charge up to 50% in around 30 minutes with a 40W adapter or higher. <br/>
<br/>
