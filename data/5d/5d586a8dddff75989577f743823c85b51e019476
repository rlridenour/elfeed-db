<p>I found a potentially <a href="https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock">useful package that creates a visual calendar inside Emacs</a>. It seems to be mostly abandoned, at least in its current form. It now requires <a href="https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock/issues/65">ugly workarounds</a> in order to work.</p>
<p>Does anyone know something like it that works currently?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: From the comments, I&rsquo;m learning that taking the requirements for compat seems to be the official fix. This is a pretty nice package. I&rsquo;m exploring it more in depth, and I might change some workflows I have accordingly. I find it amusing that I stumbled into it by chance, as I was writing my <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/10/27/emacs-and-mental-challanges.html">other post</a>.</p>
