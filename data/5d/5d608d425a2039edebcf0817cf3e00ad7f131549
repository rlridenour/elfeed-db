<p>Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced that his government will seek to prohibit children under 16 from having social media accounts as part of a forthcoming bill focused on child online safety. The proposal would make Spain one of several countries, alongside others in Europe and Australia, moving toward age-based restrictions amid concerns about mental health harms, bullying and exposure to violent or sexual content online. The planned legislation will also aim to hold social media executives legally responsible when their platforms host illegal or hateful content, signalling a tougher European regulatory stance on large tech companies. Although the measure still needs to be drafted and passed by Spain’s Parliament, Sánchez presented it as part of a broader effort to give children “a healthier relationship with technology” while preserving the benefits of the digital world.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Gbv6W18Az8fvbVD8BqpGIaVmDNYA4kanzUWq5F-KOYm5rWZ-FGUs-YZgRKArGVDfN_7Uyy04PNMW2Lq2wGgAWQHr36BcES8NyCZVN08dlU6T6Y9NmCv5DgjpIyOS2U4w_jBvKqxWgZ9TSAin_Rf1Ku1_iJ-aKVyBKp3tZihCoTiWMPCRdNJ7ryqRGl2pM-lfyGCB' alt='A child using a smartphone in Barcelona; Spain now plans nationwide age-based limits on social media use.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Wider safety package: The under-16 ban is expected to sit within a broader child-protection package that includes measures targeting addictive design features and late-night notifications aimed at young users.</li><li>Parental involvement: Officials indicated that parents would likely play a formal role in verifying their children’s ages or consenting to certain online services, although specific verification tools have not yet been detailed.</li><li>Enforcement tools: The bill is expected to introduce fines and other sanctions against companies that fail to remove unlawful or clearly harmful content directed at minors, adding to the existing enforcement powers granted by wider EU rules.</li><li>European trend: Spain’s move follows steps in France and Portugal to restrict smartphone or social media use among younger teenagers, reflecting a growing European consensus that current self-regulation by platforms is insufficient to protect children.</li><li>Global momentum: Australia’s recent decision to pursue nationwide age-based restrictions for social media has been cited by Spanish officials as evidence that concerns about youth mental health and digital addiction are shared well beyond Europe.</li></ul><blockquote>We cannot ignore the impact that social media is having on the mental health and development of our children - Pedro Sánchez</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Spanish government: Sánchez framed the initiative as a way to ensure that children grow up with technology that supports, rather than undermines, their wellbeing and education, saying it was time for the state to set clearer limits for platforms when minors are involved.
