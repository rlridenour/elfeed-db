<p>We tend to think that mirrors reverse left to right, but in fact they reverse &#8220;back to front,&#8221; along an axis perpendicular to the mirror&#8217;s surface. Our confusion arises when we misinterpret this.</p>
<p>&#8220;[I]magine a back-front reversal of yourself, with your nose, face, eyes, and so forth pushed through to the back of the head, and your back somehow oozed through to the front,&#8221; writes University of Auckland psychologist Michael C. Corballis. &#8220;You might then &#8216;feel&#8217; your watch as having remained on the left wrist (say), while back and front have reversed. However it is likely that you will also experience a strong compulsion to recalibrate your internal axes, and then feel the watch to be on the right wrist. In short, a back-front reversal is reinterpreted as a left-right reversal.&#8221;</p>
