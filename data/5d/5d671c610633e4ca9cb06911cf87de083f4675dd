</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
On that sacred time during winter dark.
</p>
        <p class="verse">
Folly is to name the days between Christmas and New Years.<br />
There’s hardly enough daytime to warrant such.<br />
Instead, let us embrace these long winter’s night;<br />
Where story presses against the glass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;breath hot, frozen fog forming crystalline lace.<br />
No logs split nor tallow lit, that once did dance.<br />
Instead, light sits steady and flat,<br />
And the only flicker that of picture panes.<br />
This is a moment when little sense does our time make.<br />
</p>
<p>I embrace <a href="https://ruk.ca/content/romjul">Romjul</a>, that period between Christmas/Boxing Day and New Year’s Eve.
For most of my life, the time between Christmas and New Years has been one of
holiday.  That is: not working for my employer, but instead spending time with
friends (both present and tome-bound).</p>
