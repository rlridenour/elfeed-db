<li>It can charge fast via cable</li>
<li>It features MagSafe charging for Qi-enabled devices</li>
<li>It can charge two devices at once</li>
<li>It looks like a camera because why not</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: Buddy, it can’t even take a picture</li>
</ul><h1>Say Cheese</h1><p>You people. We know the first thing you’re going to say when you see this.</p>
<p>Is it, “Wow, that power bank is impressively compact considering it packs 12,000mAh of recharging power”?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is it, “Cool, it can charge stuff fast with a cable or via MagSafe wireless charging and, in fact, can even charge two devices at the same time”?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Is it, “What a friggin’ deal that this thing is only 20 bucks”?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The first thing you’re gonna say is, “Wait, why does it look like a camera?”</p>
<p>And I know this is the first thing you’re going to say because it was the first thing I said when I saw it.</p>
<p>In fact, I read the <a href="https://www.laxgadgets.net/products/lax-camera-power-bank-and-magsafe-12000mah-white-and-black">marketing copy</a>, like, five times trying to figure out if this thing actually <em>is</em> a camera. (The answer seems to be no, but am I wrong to say using the phrase “capturing memories” is confusing???)</p>
<p>So, why does it look like a camera?</p>
<p>The answer will likely disappoint you.</p>
<p>This thing looks like a camera because another popular power bank on the market looks like a camera: the Zendure SuperMini Go.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/zendure-supermini-go-rugged-power-bank-that-does-it-all/">a ZDNet review of <em>that</em> power bank</a>, the sub-headline is, “Putting style back into power banks,” and in the first line, the reviewer bemoans the fact that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Power banks have become like smartphones – little black slabs with no character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I don’t care. They’re batteries. “Little black slabs with no character” feels like the appropriate level of stylishness for them.</p>
<p>But again, this is not a review of the power bank we’re selling today. It’s a review of the Zendure SuperMini Go, which is a lot like this power bank… except with 10,000mAh, not 12,000mAh like ours.</p>
<p>So buy one of these if you want a pretty nifty little power bank that just happens to look like a camera.</p>
