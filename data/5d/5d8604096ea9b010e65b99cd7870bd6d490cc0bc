The next-generation version of the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/apple-ipad-macbook-oled-displays/">feature an OLED display</a>, as part of Apple's plan to expand the display technology across many more of its devices. Apple's first OLED device was the Apple Watch in 2015, followed by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in 2017 and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> in 2024. It now apparently plans to bring the technology to more devices, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, and could start with the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; next year.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; has a Liquid Retina LCD display, just like the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. OLED offers higher contrast with true blacks, wider viewing angles, faster response times, better efficiency, and generally better perceived picture quality than LCD.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; came out in 2024, with the main upgrade over the previous version being the A17 Pro chip and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support. The previous generation introduced a complete redesign and the A15 Bionic chip.<br/>
<br/>
In August, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/ipad-mini-a19-pro-chip/">mistakenly shared code</a> that revealed key information about the next-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; with the codename J510/J511: The device features the A19 Pro chip, which is used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; uses a version of the A17 Pro chip from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15 Pro with a five-core GPU. The A19 Pro used in the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; also has a five-core GPU, as opposed to the full six-core version in the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models, so it seems likely that this binned version of the chip will be the one used in the next &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> claims that Apple is working on a version of the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; that has a more <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/ipad-mini-water-resistance/">water resistant design</a>, making it the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with a water resistance rating.<br/>
<br/>
While the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has IP68 water resistance that allows it to withstand submersion in water up to six meters deep for 30 minutes, it is not yet known what IP rating the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; might feature. The &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s updated casing is expected to offer water resistance similar to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, making it safe for casual use in wet environments like a bath or a pool area.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly developed a new speaker system for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; that uses vibration-based technology, allowing for the speaker holes in the device to be removed. Removing the speaker holes would cut down on areas where water could get into the crevices of the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
For the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Apple uses adhesive and gaskets to protect the speaker holes and other ingress points from water intrusion, so the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s design would be radically different. The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; does not have an official water resistance rating and it is not safe to get it wet.<br/>
<br/>
With an OLED display, water resistance, a new speaker system, and a faster chip, the device is expected to be more expensive, and Apple could charge up to &#36;100 more for the device. The &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is currently priced starting at &#36;499. Apple will purportedly launch the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; 8 with OLED display in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/26/oled-ipad-mini-no-earlier-than-q3-2026/">third quarter of next year</a> at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
We also discuss further thoughts on the M5 Vision Pro, weighing up its utility for travel and day-to-day use-case, and take a look at the growing differentiation and optionality within Apple's product lineups. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.<br/>
