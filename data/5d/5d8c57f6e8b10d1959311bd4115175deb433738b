<p>I&rsquo;ve been setting up my <a href="https://freshrss.org">FreshRSS</a> server since the weekend, and so far I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the results.</p>

<p>Inspired by Moly White&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/">piece</a> <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/08/01/thinking-about-organizing-my-rss.html">last month</a>, I pulled up my sleeves and went to work. It&rsquo;s not easy. In fact, it&rsquo;s one of the most complex tech projects I&rsquo;ve dealt with in a while, which is good, because I felt like I need to tackle something new.</p>
<p>In general, the FreshRSS setup can be split into three parts: Docker on my Synology (called Container Manager), the FreshRSS server itself, and then configuring it to use Elfeed on Emacs. Each one of these parts (especially the first) took time. It was also the first time I used AI extensively. I couldn&rsquo;t have made the progress I&rsquo;ve made without AI - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonshot_AI#Kimi">Kimi</a> specifically, which is the current default service offered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagi_(search_engine)">Kagi</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to share here, and I have a lot of notes to sift through. I still have work to do as well: Elfeed doesn&rsquo;t seem to pull updates from the server consistently for some reason (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t), and I&rsquo;m not exactly happy with having it exposed to the web with port forwarding, but hey, it works.</p>
<p>I should expand more, but it&rsquo;s late, and I need to catch some sleep.</p>
