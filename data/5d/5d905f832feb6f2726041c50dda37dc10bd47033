<p>Four Crew-11 members returned to Earth on January 15 after NASA cut their International Space Station mission short due to a medical issue affecting one astronaut. NASA said it made the decision because of a continuing health risk and has not publicly identified the crew member or the condition. The crew included two Americans (Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman), a Russian cosmonaut (Oleg Platonov), and a Japanese astronaut (Kimiya Yui), highlighting continued international cooperation in orbit even during an unexpected return.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/NfBprTiZrqc05Er5QMSkwyYTxjbzBE2NoCQAeL6jYXe_alMgH1-QIJE_yU20f_RCHBUXhmAUmsRLbvkE1T_R6YiGJVBV7ntEaIADToi8fcC_NRooC6n-1t_eWnfBKzIyvNUzxLcHAtb9HkKM6AG2100hTmU8_W2VFGTbscIraKJsswKAyx4dgGhVGae5LG7Y5beWQr78TMlk3Ugu55QK_ic2TjjycVP3qJJ5TJY6bkwXyb-XO8sOJD0' alt='Astronauts Mike Fincke, Oleg Platonov, Zena Cardman, and Kimiya Yui aboard the International Space Station on Jan. 14, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Undocking coverage: NASA video showed the spacecraft undocking from the ISS at 22:20 GMT on Wednesday.</li><li>Pacific landing: Le Monde reported the crew was expected to arrive off the California coast overnight after leaving the station early.</li><li>Splashdown reported: Several outlets described the crew splashing down safely back on Earth after the early departure.</li><li>Risk language: Deutsche Welle said NASA ended the stay a few weeks early because of a &quot;lingering risk&quot; to an astronaut’s health.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>NASA: The agency ended the mission early due to a continuing health risk, while keeping the affected astronaut’s identity and medical details private.
