Apple today shared a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> ad that highlights the Clean Up feature that's available in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app. In the spot, a man snaps a photo of a woman with her cat, and then removes the cat from the image using Clean Up.<br/>

Both the cat and the woman are upset with the change, so he undoes it, demonstrating the reversible nature of the feature.<br/>

Clean Up is an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> tool that is able to remove unwanted and distracting objects from a photo. It is accessible through the editing interface in the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app. You can swipe over whatever you want removed in an image, and the Clean Up tool will do its best to replace it by cloning the background and other elements of the photo.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; is available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro models, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, and it will be available on the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/apple-ad-clean-up-photos/">Latest Apple Ad Highlights &#039;Clean Up&#039; Feature in Photos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-apple-ad-highlights-clean-up-feature-in-photos.2461718/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
