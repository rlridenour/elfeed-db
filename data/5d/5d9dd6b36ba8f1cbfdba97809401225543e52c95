9 PM on a schoolday, time for me to nudge A+ off
to bed. A+ is clicking through the Stardew Valley
wiki, slurping up all sorts of trivia that she'll
probably trickle into our conversations. There are
two pieces of homework left to do, one with quite
a few slides to complete. And drawing. She's not a
big fan of drawing assignments. "My hand is
tired," she says.
</p>

<p>
I try to be calm and supportive. I wobble.
<i>Could've done this earlier,</i> I think. I manage to
keep myself from saying it. I teeter, noticing
myself mentally fast-forwarding decades ahead. Oh
no, she's not going to get the hang of doing
things that she finds boring, she won't develop
study skills or executive control, she'll cram
through all the classes she can coast in, and all
of it will come crashing down in university when
she might actually need to buckle down and study.
</p>

<p>
She's 9! She's a long way from university.
</p>

<p>
I'm learning to embrace my anxiety and appreciate
how it tries to keep us all safe. This feeling
makes sense. I want to help her avoid mistakes,
especially when the feedback cycle is long and the
results of choices will only be seen much later.
</p>

<p>
But anxiety gets in the way of parenting. If I let
the fearful part of my brain take over, I'll
inadvertently teach her that mistakes are
catastrophic rather than just ordinary Tuesdays. I
want to hold her steady, but the wobbles are how
we learn.
</p>

<p>
It's somewhat manageable now, when we can talk
about these things openly. A+ can laugh off my
worries ("Mom, you're fretting again,") and W- can
remind me to slow down when it runs away with me.
He's usually pretty chill about all this. It'll be
harder when the cognitive rewiring of puberty or
menopause turn ordinary conversations into
minefields right when the stakes get higher. The
more I tighten my grip, the more star systems will
slip through my fingers. (There I go again with
catastrophizing.)
</p>

<p>
Besides, I want to help A+ avoid the paralysis of
perfectionism or self-recrimination. I want her to
be able to experiment, and to pick herself up and try
again if things don't work out the first time
around. To do that, I need to learn to change my
perspective from being anxious about mistakes to
seeing the opportunities for re-takes.
</p>

<p>
There are many things I can't teach A+. Some
things can't fully be taught, they can only be
learned, like how to balance the clay on the
pottery wheel. Sometimes I don't even know what
the right answer would be, like what kinds of tips
work for her particular brain. Some things change
over time and she'll need to change with them,
like how to adapt to life's situations. She'll
need to learn how to learn instead of relying on
one fixed answer.

<p>
Fortunately, life comes with so many opportunities
to practise. The <a href="https://www.tdsb.on.ca/Portals/0/aboutus/docs/Elementary%202024-25%20School%20Year%20Calendar.pdf">Toronto public school calendar</a>
has 187 instructional days, so she gets plenty of
chances to manage her homework and get feedback.
The repetitive nature of things used to frustrate
me when it came to my tasks (<a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/04/indieweb-april-2025-renewal/">always more dishes to
wash, always more clothes to fold</a>), but it's good
for learning, especially while the stakes are low.
It's her experiment, I remind myself. About half
the time, she doesn't even want my help. ("I can
<i>do</i> it, Mom.") She's sensible enough to try
things out on small experiments instead of scary
ones: shopping at the grocery store on her own,
not skydiving.
</p>

<p>
There's plenty of stuff for me to learn while she
learns. When I get the urge to correct her work
("How does that line up with the rubric?") or nag
her to get her work done, I tell myself:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Is it really a problem?</b> The teacher isn't
expecting her to completely master all the
skills, and the teacher is in a good place to
give developmentally-appropriate feedback. I can
let her experiment with how much work she wants
to put into things, and she can see what that
results in. Despite all my twitchiness about how
she puts off her daily homework until 9 PM, she
still manages to get things done. Judging from
the frequent reminders her teacher gives the
virtual class, she's probably ahead of the
curve. So maybe it's not a problem.</li>

<li><b>Whose problem is it?</b> Something might not be my
problem. It might not even be her problem. She
reads during class time, for instance. Sometimes
she misses something that can't be figured out
from just the homework slide deck. Maybe that's
partly her experimenting to find the right
balance between attention and stimulation. Maybe
that's also partly a consequence of how school
is designed to go at the group's pace. Not
entirely her problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The more I let go of the small stuff, the more
experience she'll be able to draw on for the big
stuff. I hope she'll get the hang of thinking of
life as mostly series of little experiments, and
to notice when there's a bigger choice that needs
more thinking because it's more long-term. The
more she decides, the more confidence we both
develop in her decisions.
</p>

<p>
This reminds me of how kids learn how to bike. The
popular approach uses training wheels to prevent
falls. The idea is to gradually raise them as the
kid improves, but I usually see kids pedaling
along (perhaps slightly leaning over to one side)
to match the slowness of parents' walking. It's
hard to balance when you're going slow. But
pedaling isn't the hard part. Balancing is, and
you develop balance by balancing. Maybe that's a
little like how I get tempted to rescue A+ from
the results of some of her choices, but letting
her try things is how to help her learn.
</p>

</figure>

</div>

<p>
A+ learned how to bike using a balance bike
instead of using training wheels. When she was
two, she toddled along on a Strider, which was
light enough for her to manage. Eventually she
figured out coasting. She was proud of being able
to do it on her own. Then we upgraded her to a
Cleary Gecko freewheel bike, with proper
hand-brakes and everything. After a few attempts
with us holding her under her armpits, she was
ready for us to steady her with a hand on her
back, and then for us to be close, and then she
was off on her own. She fell and skinned her knee
many times, developing an appreciation of pants
for protection and ice cream for comfort. The more
she biked, the more she learned how to notice that
feeling of being slightly off-balance, and the
better she got at correcting it. Now we can bike
on the streets together.
</p>

<p>
You can't learn how to bike if the training wheels
are always on, or if someone's always holding you
steady. It's okay to wobble and fall and get up.
You learn that you can survive a skinned knee, and
so you keep going.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, when A+'s in the middle of a meltdown,
I have to remind myself not to try to fix it in
the moment. That doesn't work, anyway. Just take
the loss and try again next time. Sometimes, once
we've both calmed down, I ask A+ to imagine
rewinding back to a situation so we can play it
out a little differently. Sorry, I meant to say
this, not that. Would that work better? Next time.
</p>

<p>
Not mistakes. Data. Just another step in the
journey.

Getting better at getting better helps me, too.
I've been practising piano, making steady progress
through the <a href="https://www.hellosimply.com/simply-piano">Simply Piano</a> app. I've been playing
for about four months now. I took piano lessons as
a kid, but not to any serious extent. Back then, I
got bored with the simple exercises I had to do.
Now I feel slow, snail-slow, but I can savour the
way my mind is beginning to get the hang of
things, knowing that it will take me many tries to
get the hang of it. I'm starting to be able to
look at the notes and remember the phrases,
imagine what the next sequence will sound like
before I play it, and notice how my hands move to
make it happen.
</p>

<p>
When my fingers wobble on the keys, I slow down
and try again. There's no point in berating
myself. If my mind keeps hiccuping or my fingers
keep stumbling, I can think: ah, is this because
I'm tired, or because I want to do something else,
or just because I'm learning and it takes time to
get the hang of things? I'm getting better at
figuring out when I should probably call it a day
so that I don't practise mistakes into my muscle
memory and when I might benefit from just slowing
down the segment.
</p>

<p>
I still stumble through pieces I've successfully
played before. Remembering is hard. But I'm
getting better at being patient with myself,
accepting that it's because I'm still in the
middle of the journey. It's not a mistake that I
should grump at myself about. It's just part of a
re-take. This is what learning looks (and sounds)
like. Of course it doesn't start out perfectly
smooth.
</p>

<p>
Here's me learning Mozart's "Rondo alla Turca",
with the app providing accompaniment in the
background. It's not perfect, but it's progress.

<p>
We were at the playground. I ate the remaining
crackers in the snack box because I thought A+ was
done. Turns out she was saving them for later. She
was very upset. I apologized and promised to ask
next time, but she was too far gone to hear.
</p>

<p>
That was a tough moment. A+ was already
emotionally off-balance because the playdate
hadn't gone as well as it usually does.
Discovering I had eaten the crackers she was
looking forward to was the last straw. She
dissolved into tears. I snuggled her and settled
in for a long wait. I think: Where's the line
between comforting her and coddling her? Does my
anxiety teach her this is too hard to handle?
We're not quite at the point of being able to
shrug off mistakes. I remind myself that she'll
learn what she's ready to learn.
</p>

<p>
Looking around while A+ drenched my left shoulder,
I noticed a skateboarder on the park road. Maybe a
man in his thirties? He was trying to jump his
skateboard over a low concrete lane divider. He
had been at it for a while before I noticed. Most
times, he was able to clear the divider, but the
skateboard slowed down too much on the other side
and he had to jump off. On the seventh try that I
saw, he landed back on the skateboard and rolled
on for a bit. Success! He tried again and failed.
Four more failures before his next success. One
more attempt&#x2013;another failure&#x2013;and then he called
it a day. I'm sure he'll be back at it.
</p>

<p>
A+ continued to cry. My phone buzzed, reminding me
that we probably wanted to get going before the
rain in the forecast. I carried her as I picked up
our bags and put them in my bike. Eventually I
needed to gradually ease her off me. She curled up
in the bucket of my front-loader cargo bike, still
crying. I tucked the towel around her like a
blanket, buckled her bike into the tow-bag, and
walked the bikes home. She fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
A wobble, a fall. But I'm sure we'll be back at it
too. (And we did; the next day, she was happily
playing with her friends again.)
</p>

<p>
</p><div aria-label="section" separator"="" class="section-separator" style="text-align:center">・・・・・</div>
<p></p>

<p>
It's hard to be in the moment. Sometimes the
moment sucks. It's hard to be far ahead in the
future. It makes decisions feel too big. Do-overs
make things just the right size. If we can get
good at shrugging off the inevitable failures and
treating them as data so that we can sketch out
ideas for the next experiment, I think that'd be
pretty cool. Instead of "Oh no!" or even "Are you
<i>sure</i> about that?" (what kid likes to be
doubted?), I can lean towards, "Hmm, let's find
out."
</p>

<p>
As predicted, we had another late-night homework
situation. This time she had a headache and wanted
to go to bed, homework unfinished. I was able to
let go and just focus on snuggling her in. The
next day, after morning routines and without any
nagging, she did the homework and submitted it.
Late, but done.
</p>

<p>
There'll be another bedtime homework session,
I'm sure. I have to trust that even though I want
to shortcut the learning for her, she's got this.
She's figuring things out. If we stumble, that
just helps us practice for next time, and there
are so many opportunities to try again. The wobble
is not the obstacle, it's the way.<sup><a id="fnr.obstacle" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.obstacle" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
