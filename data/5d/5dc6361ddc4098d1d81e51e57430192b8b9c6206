Apple today seeded the fourth beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.5 update to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a week after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/21/macos-sequoia-15-5-beta-3-developers/">released the third</a> &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.5 beta.<br/>

Registered developers can opt-in to the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.5 appears to be a minor update so far, and no notable new features were found in the first three betas.<br/>

Work on new features for &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; is winding down, as Apple will soon transition to macOS 16. The next-generation version of macOS is set to be unveiled at WWDC in June.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/28/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-macos-sequoia-15-5/">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of macOS Sequoia 15.5 [Update: Public Beta Available]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-macos-sequoia-15-5-update-public-beta-available.2456106/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
