<p>Bruce Springsteen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wrote this song on Saturday, recorded it yesterday and released
it to you today in response to the state terror being visited on
the city of Minneapolis. It’s dedicated to the people of
Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of
Alex Pretti and Renee Good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Best line from the lyrics:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Their claim was self-defense, <br />
Just don’t believe your eyes. <br />
It’s our blood and bones and these whistles and phones <br />
Against Miller and Noem’s dirty lies.</p>
</blockquote>
