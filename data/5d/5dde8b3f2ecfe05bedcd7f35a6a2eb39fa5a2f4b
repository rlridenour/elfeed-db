<p>While <a href="https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/110227186721704189">experimenting with delegating Markdown</a> blocks to <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/">Org babel</a> in Emacs <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell">chatgpt-shell</a>, I resurrected <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui">ob-swiftui</a>. A package I had written to execute and render SwiftUI blocks in org babel.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui">ob-swiftui</a> has two modes of rendering SwiftUI blocks: <code>:results window</code>, which runs outside of Emacs in a native window and <code>:results file</code>, which renders and saves to a file. The latter can be viewed directly from Emacs.</p>
<p><code>:results file</code> was a little clunky. That is, it hardcoded dimensions I had to manually modify if the canvas wasn't big enough. It was also a little slow.</p>
<p>The clunkyness really came through with my chatgpt-shell experiments, so I took a closer look and made a few changes to remove hardcoding and speeds things up.</p>
<p>The results ain't too shabby.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/ob-swiftui-updates/file-render.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Another tiny improvement is that if you'd like to compose a more complex layout made of multiple custom views, <code>ob-swiftui</code> now looks for a <code>ContentView</code> as that root view by default. Specifying another root view was already possible but it had to be explicitly requested via <code>:view</code> param.</p>
<p>You can now omit the <code>:view</code> param if you name the root view <code>ContentView</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-org">#+begin_src swiftui
  struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TopView()
        BottomView()
    }
  }

  struct TopView: View {
    var body: some View {
      Text(&quot;Top text&quot;)
    }
  }

  struct BottomView: View {
    var body: some View {
      Text(&quot;Bottom text&quot;)
    }
  }
#+end_src
</code></pre>
<p>The improvements have been pushed to <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui">ob-swiftui</a> and will soon be picked up on <a href="https://melpa.org/#/ob-swiftui">melpa</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: Added ContentView details.</p>
