<p>There was a time when QuickTime was <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2025/12/how-quicktime-survived-90s-apple-to-become-invisible-and-ubiquitous/">more than just a playback utility</a>; I used it frequently to perform simple video edits, like removing commercials from an off-air recording or tacking the contents of one file on the end of another.</p>
<p>Since those days ended with the deprecation of classic QuickTime, I’ve never really had a go-to utility for these kinds of trims. Sure, I can import the video into an editor and then re-export it, but that requires a second round of lossy encoding, which can make video look lousy. Better is to edit the already-compressed video itself. (This is what I use Rogue Amoeba’s excellent <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/fission/">Fission</a> to do with audio. Fission lets me edit an MP3 file without re-encoding it and adding a whole second layer of compression artifacts.)</p>
<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: <em>Reader Michaël wrote in to point out, amazingly, that at some point years ago Apple added editing features back to QuickTime Player. If I knew about this, I forgot it. If you press Command-Y, you can split clips, and you can delete and re-order those clips. The issue is that the final file you save is a MOV container featuring those clips, which (I believe—tell me if I’m wrong, Michaël!) means that in the end you have to re-encode the video to get a seamless mp4 file for a video podcast.</em>]</p>
<p>A few weeks ago after a <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/tpk/">Total Party Kill</a> session, I found myself once again needing to perform some trims to the “video bootleg” of the session. In the middle of the game, we took a ten-minute break, and I didn’t want viewers of the video to have to fast forward through 10 minutes of dead air.</p>
<p>This time, I decided to look for a visual utility (i.e., not something I have to drive from Terminal) that could solve this problem. And I found it: the open-source app <a href="https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/blob/master/README.md">LosslessCut</a>, which provides a nice interface atop the powerful FFmpeg command-line app.</p>
<p>If I’m being honest, the app is not exactly intuitive, but there’s a bunch of documentation and after about five minutes I had learned every single keystroke required to do exactly what I wanted. The app let me cut segments out of the video, but it also supports rearranging segments, combining tracks, and an enormous set of other features I don’t care about, though you might.</p>
<p>Since the app is open-source and on GitHub, you can get it for free, or you can <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1505323402">get it on the Mac App Store</a> for $19 and support the work of developer Mikael Finstad, which is what I did.</p>
