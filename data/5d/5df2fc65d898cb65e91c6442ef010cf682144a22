Respected veteran display analyst Ross Young has added his support to a new leak today about the iPhone 18 Pro's front-panel design.<br/>

In a new <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/2013628564223008849?s=20">post on X (Twitter)</a>, the now-retired Counterpoint Research VP said that Chinese leaker Instant Digital's latest explanation of how Apple will shrink the Dynamic Island is what he was alluding to in a report last year.<br/>
<br/>
Back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/iphone-18-pro-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/">June 2025</a>, Young said that while some parts of Apple's Face ID system would move under the display on iPhone 18 Pro models, the devices would retain visible Face ID elements – meaning the Dynamic Island would persist, albeit in a smaller form than on the iPhone 14 Pro through iPhone 17 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
That's effectively what Instant Digital claimed earlier today: the leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/iphone-18-pro-leak-smaller-dynamic-island/">explained</a> that only the IR flood illuminator would move under the display to the top-left corner, while the dot projector, infrared camera, and selfie camera would remain housed in a reduced, centered Dynamic Island. Another Chinese leaker has since <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/2013565099513155780?s=20">backed the claim</a>, which also corresponds to reporting last year by <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-16/apple-iphone-17-air-foldable-iphone-details-ai-crisis-to-haunt-top-100-event-m8bl3a9c">Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Young's corroboration directly contradicts a recent report by <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma that said Apple would move the selfie camera to the top-left corner of the iPhone 18 Pro's display, resulting in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/iphone-18-pro-features-report/">hole-punch cutout</a> and the removal of the pill-shaped Dynamic Island. <br/>
<br/>
It seems increasingly likely that details from Ma's sources were either lost in translation or misinterpreted, possibly due to partial knowledge of an under-display Face ID component.<br/>
