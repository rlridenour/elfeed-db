Apple today provided the third beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a> 26.3 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming a little over a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/macos-tahoe-26-3-beta-2/">launch of the second beta</a>. <br/>

Developers can download the &zwnj;macOS Tahoe&zwnj; 26.3 update by opening up the System Settings app, selecting the General category, and then choosing Software Update. Beta Updates will need to be enabled, and a free developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
There's no word yet on what's included in &zwnj;macOS Tahoe&zwnj; 26.3, and no new features were found in the first two betas. <br/>
<br/>
We'll likely see Apple release &zwnj;macOS Tahoe&zwnj; 26.3 at the end of January given past launch timelines.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-tahoe.250">macOS Tahoe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-releases-macos-tahoe-26-3-beta-3/">Third macOS Tahoe 26.3 Beta Now Available for Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/third-macos-tahoe-26-3-beta-now-available-for-developers.2476677/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
