<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 3 licenses ($29.99 value each) for <a href="https://www.apparentsoft.com/trickster">Trickster</a>. I was wrong, the series continues for at least one more app. You know how handy &ldquo;Open recent file&rdquo; is in your favorite apps? What if you could have that, but for every file you&rsquo;ve recently interacted with? That&rsquo;s what Trickster does, putting all your recent files in your menu bar, whether you recently read it in Preview, downloaded it from a website, or just had it open in any application. Instant access, and keyboard and mouse friendly.</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don&rsquo;t worry about where you just saved a certain file, it&rsquo;s in your menu bar. Closed the wrong window? The document you were reading is in Trickster, one click away.</p>
</blockquote>
