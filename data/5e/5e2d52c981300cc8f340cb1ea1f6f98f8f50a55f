<p>Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified at the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics after officials said his competition helmet—decorated with images honoring Ukrainians killed in Russia’s invasion—violated Olympic rules that limit political messaging and athlete self-expression. The ruling meant he could not start his race after he refused to remove or alter the design, according to the IOC and reporting from multiple outlets. The decision quickly became a flashpoint over how the Olympics should handle war-related expression. Heraskevych said he designed the helmet to keep attention on the human cost of the war and said he planned to appeal the disqualification. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the decision; RT reported that he also argued Russian athletes should be barred even if competing as neutrals. Ukrainians rallied publicly behind Heraskevych, turning the episode into a broader show of solidarity for families and sports communities affected by the war—even as Games organizers stressed neutrality as central to keeping the Olympics open to as many nations as possible.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/P_NAz00h6d5krKKVjr4IH5M8wuu-cpvM-JY77-noNeZDV6ngGxgfwEiBTEM_fHCAjJN5x5-5WSRsigBHny33A28HJtW5NAMmP_13YfGR-NRqWfyP7lbHB2Q20BYSdfpRal0BeOEvqoDQI36FOt0zsM4UehOZtsn4Kx4XteTyxDWut4xUSDOSCvNGVM11_0FUnq7a' alt='Ukraine’s Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified for wearing a helmet to commemorate athletes who were killed in the war with Russia.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>How it unfolded: Heraskevych said he learned of the disqualification after an early-morning meeting with IOC President Kirsty Coventry at the sliding venue, shortly before his competition was set to start, according to IOC-linked reporting.</li><li>Public defense: The Globe and Mail said Coventry appeared tearful as she defended the decision to disqualify him.</li><li>Team role: Meduza reported Heraskevych arrived in Italy as captain of Ukraine’s skeleton team.</li><li>Named remembrance: Meduza reported the helmet featured portraits of multiple Ukrainians—among them athletes—killed during the war, including biathlete Yevhen Malyshev and boxer Maksym Halynychev.</li><li>Stated intent: In the post unveiling the design, Meduza quoted Heraskevych saying the helmet was meant to show the world “the price Ukraine pays daily in this bloody war” and that “We remember those whose lives Russia has taken”.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>International Olympic Committee: The IOC said the ban followed its restrictions on political messaging and argued the athlete’s refusal to modify the helmet left officials no workable compromise.
