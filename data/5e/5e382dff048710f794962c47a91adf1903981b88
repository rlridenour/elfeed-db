<p>President Trump said the United States will &quot;very soon&quot; expand its anti-drug campaign targeting suspected Venezuelan traffickers from the sea to operations &quot;by land,&quot; speaking during a Thanksgiving video call with deployed US troops on Thursday. Washington says recent strikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have sharply reduced the volume of narcotics reaching US shores by sea, and Trump argued that smugglers are now shifting routes over land through Venezuela and neighboring countries. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s government rejects the US accusations and describes the anti-drug push as a pretext for pressure and regime change, heightening tensions between Washington and Caracas. The announcement raises concerns among regional observers about whether any future land operations would occur inside Venezuela’s territory, in border areas, or through closer cooperation with other Latin American states.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Jd2r01k1Um3QyCwGzMv3wTEqD0oxY9Oow99gKAyF_GxJMlIUqTEoSPnXyqO1HKpUPjfYTRST1zmxMnmi5Uw8HXSwQKyyoRRhqgq2jZ1jwu9qimVIqSgLdJT4aNV8J3mx2CT4OkhZr0iMz4CoNTeCUmTWD05b90nFF5g' alt='President Trump speaks remotely with US troops during a Thanksgiving call where he discussed expanding operations against Venezuelan drug traffickers.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Maritime campaign: US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September, forming the backdrop to Trump’s call for a new land phase.</li><li>Claimed sea results: Trump said naval and air operations in the region have cut the amount of drugs trafficked by sea by about 85 percent, though independent verification of that figure was not provided in the reports.</li><li>Cartel designation: Earlier in the week, Washington designated the group known as the Cartel of the Suns, which US officials link to elements within Venezuela’s security forces, as a terrorist organisation, further escalating bilateral tensions.</li><li>US justification: In his Thanksgiving remarks, Trump framed tougher measures as a response to what he called Venezuelan &quot;poison&quot; being sent to the United States, asserting that prior warnings had been ignored.</li><li>Venezuelan stance: Caracas insists it already combats drug trafficking and argues that US actions, including lethal strikes on alleged traffickers at sea, violate international law and are intended to undermine Maduro’s government.</li></ul><blockquote>We warned them.
