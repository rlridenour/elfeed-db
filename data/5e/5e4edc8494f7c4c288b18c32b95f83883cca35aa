<p>One small update I just appended to my piece Friday taking a look at the winning apps from this year’s App Store Awards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lastly, I have questions — some really hard questions — regarding <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/tiimo-icon.png">Tiimo’s app icon</a>. Such as, “What is that?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it got picked because it makes <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/07/tahoes-terrible-icons">Apple’s new OS 26 icons</a> look good by comparison?</p>
