<p>English novelist Winifred Ashton had a disastrous gift for inadvertent double entendre. From <a href="https://archive.org/details/rememberedlaught00lesl/page/228/mode/2up">Cole Lesley&#8217;s biography of Noël Coward</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The first I can remember was when poor Gladys was made by Noël to explain to Winifred that she simply could not say in her latest novel, &#8216;He stretched out and grasped the other&#8217;s gnarled, stumpy tool.&#8217; The Bloomers poured innocently from her like an ever-rolling stream: &#8216;Olwen&#8217;s got crabs!&#8217; she cried as you arrived for dinner, or &#8216;We&#8217;re having roast cock tonight!&#8217; At the Old Vic, in the crowded foyer, she argued in ringing tones, &#8216;But Joyce, it&#8217;s well <em>known</em> that Shakespeare sucked Bacon dry.&#8217; It was Joyce too who anxiously inquired after some goldfish last seen in a pool in the blazing sun and was reassured, &#8216;Oh, they&#8217;re all right now! They&#8217;ve got a vast erection covered with everlasting pea!&#8217; &#8216;Oh the pleasure of waking up to see a row of tits outside your window,&#8217; she said to Binkie during a weekend at Knott&#8217;s Fosse. Schoolgirl slang sometimes came into it, for she was in fact the original from whom Noël created Madame Arcati: &#8216;Do you remember the night we all had Dick on toast?&#8217; she inquired in front of the Governor of Jamaica and Lady Foot. Then there was her ghost story : &#8216;Night after night for weeks she tried to make him come &#8230;&#8217;

<p>&#8220;Why could she not have used the word &#8216;materialise&#8217;?&#8221; wrote Lesley, who was Coward&#8217;s secretary. &#8220;But then if she had we should never have had the fun.&#8221; See <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2009/08/19/shocking-2/">Shocking!</a></p>
