Apple's AirTag 4-Pack has been available at an all-time low price thanks to early Black Friday deals this month, and today the 1-Pack has finally joined in on the savings. You can get the AirTag 1-Pack for just <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CWXNS552%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;18.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;29.00.<br/>
