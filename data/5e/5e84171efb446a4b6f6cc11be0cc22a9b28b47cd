<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin is in New Delhi for his first visit to India since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, holding a two‑day summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi focused on trade, energy and defence cooperation amid strong pressure from the United States and Europe over India’s ties with Moscow. India has become a major buyer of discounted Russian seaborne crude after European states cut purchases, but is now seeking relief from US sanctions and tariffs that Washington imposed in response to those oil imports. Modi told Putin that &quot;India is not neutral&quot; and instead &quot;on the side of peace&quot; in the Ukraine conflict, while Putin said Russia has shared details of a proposed &quot;peaceful settlement&quot; in Ukraine with India and is working with other partners, including the United States, on possible steps. Beyond Ukraine, the leaders discussed lifting trade imbalances, setting a goal of expanding bilateral trade toward $100 billion by 2030, and moving forward on a 2030 Economic Programme, a potential free trade agreement with the Russia‑backed Eurasian Economic Union, and new deals in defence, labour mobility and civil nuclear cooperation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Yg8VCuQwAh5nZa01bt4IfjcvFqRSdb_hpnpHzGEEPjFl8GTyfpAsc2gZL0chJOo_5bvF_bYEj9g-DTKIy5gyGjHI9o0fWocQFEWVxp3y9xyK' alt='Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomes Russian President Vladimir Putin in New Delhi as the two leaders begin a high‑stakes summit.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Defence cooperation: Putin’s visit has opened one of the most expansive recent defence dialogues between India and Russia, with discussions on air defence systems, Su‑57 fighter jet collaboration, missile programmes such as BrahMos and fixing supply‑chain issues for existing Russian‑origin hardware.</li><li>Future deals: Officials and analysts expect possible agreements on Su‑57 combat aircraft, the S‑500 air defence system, a labour mobility pact enabling thousands of Indian professionals to work in Russia, and a civil nuclear cooperation arrangement during or after the summit.</li><li>US pressure: The summit takes place as India negotiates trade deals with both the United States and the European Union and faces punitive American tariffs linked to its continued purchases of Russian oil, forcing New Delhi to weigh relations with Moscow against the risk of further economic measures from Washington.</li><li>Domestic politics: Modi personally greeted Putin at the airport but did not permit meetings with opposition leaders, a move that opposition figure Rahul Gandhi criticised as reflecting government &quot;insecurity&quot; within India’s domestic political scene.</li><li>Chinese commentary: Chinese state‑linked media framed Putin’s two‑day trip as a &quot;clear message&quot; that neither Russia nor India is internationally isolated despite Western pressure, underlining how other major powers are closely watching the visit.</li></ul><blockquote>India is not neutral.
