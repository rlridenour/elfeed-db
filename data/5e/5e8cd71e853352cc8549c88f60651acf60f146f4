Both new and returning subscribers can <a href="https://www.halfbrick.com/applearcade/bluey-x-fruit-ninja-classic-apple-arcade-promotion">sign up on the Halfbrick website</a> to get a free one-month &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; trial. New subscribers can pair the free month with Apple's 30-day trial option, for a total of two free months. As long as it's been more than 30 days since you last tried &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;, returning subscribers can also get a free month.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; promo codes are available in the United States, Canada, Australia, UK, Germany, Japan, Philippines, Brazil, and Mexico.<br/>

&zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; is normally &#36;6.99 per month for the whole family, and there are hundreds of &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; titles you can try. &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; games have no in-app purchases or ads, which is ideal for kids.<br/>

Halfbrick is offering the free &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; codes to promote a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fruit-ninja-classic/id1552127102">Bluey-themed Fruit Ninja crossover event</a> that's been going on this summer.
