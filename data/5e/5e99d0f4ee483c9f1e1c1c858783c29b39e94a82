Problem: JavaScript doesn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;chars&rdquo; EDIT [2022-07-19 Tue] no-interop solution from
In languages with an integer-based Char datatype, such as C and Java and probably by inheritance JVM Clojure, you could iterate through characters by the equivalent of (+ \A 1). JS doesn&rsquo;t have chars though; only strings. Is there a nice way out-of-the-box to iterate through the characters of the alphabet, perhaps just in one case? I mean, obviously we could create a collection that contains all the letters we want, but is that already done somewhere?
