<p>Josh Kovensky, reporting for TPM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a withering 46-page opinion on Wednesday, D.C. Chief Judge
James Boasberg laid out how he came to believe that the Trump
administration was acting in bad faith during its Alien Enemies
Act removals.</p>

<p>Boasberg set the stage for potential contempt prosecutions in the
order. He also detailed what he came to see as the Trump
administration’s scheme to shield its plan to use rarely invoked
wartime powers to remove more than 100 Venezuelans to a Salvadoran
detention facility, depriving them of due process and the courts
of the ability to review what was taking place.</p>

<p>Below are five points on Boasberg’s opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d never heard of Boasberg until recently, but he has a rather distinctive surname. Turns out he’s also the judge presiding over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646809/ftc-v-meta-antitrust-monopoly-trial-instagram-whatsapp">the FTC v. Meta antitrust case that’s in court this week</a>. Busy man.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Turns out he’s <em>also</em> the judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-trump-deportation-case-assigned-lawsuit-over-signal-scandal-2025-03-26/">in the lawsuit</a> “alleging Trump officials violated federal record-keeping laws by using a Signal group chat to discuss looming military action against Yemen’s Houthis.”</p>
