If you have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> with an M3 Ultra chip and can't get macOS Tahoe to install, you're not alone. There is a bug that is preventing the update from installing properly on machines that have the M3 Ultra.<br/>

Affected users go to install macOS Tahoe, wait through the installation process and see the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; reboot, and then end up with macOS Sequoia 15.7 still running instead of macOS Tahoe. The macOS Tahoe update fails again and again.<br/>
<br/>
A discussion thread on the <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/256136192?sortBy=rank">Apple Support Communities</a> suggests that the bug is impacting all Mac Studios with an M3 Ultra chip, and we have a &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; that is unable to be upgraded. A Mac user who <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/256136192?answerId=261569125022#261569125022">dug into the error messages</a> suggests that the installer loads the macOS Tahoe driver for the Apple Neural Engine, but then a hardware check fails, and the installation process is aborted.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; owners say that attempting to install via standard software update, safe mode, and recovery mode have all failed. There is no known fix right now, and M3 Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; users will need to wait for Apple to release a fix to solve the issue.<br/>

Apple is aware of the problem, so hopefully the problem will be resolved shortly.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-tahoe.250">macOS Tahoe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/macos-tahoe-m3-ultra-mac-studio-bug/">Bug Prevents M3 Ultra Mac Studios From Installing macOS Tahoe</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bug-prevents-m3-ultra-mac-studios-from-installing-macos-tahoe.2466230/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
