<p>An Ethiopian asylum seeker, Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, who was jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman, was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford, prompting a national police manhunt and urgent public appeals for information . Justice Minister David Lammy said he was “appalled” and the government is working with police to find the man, while Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the release “totally unacceptable” and said officers were tracking him down . The case has reopened public tensions after the attacks earlier this year sparked local demonstrations and counter-protests in towns where asylum seekers are housed .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/H3q7Ou6M57EwMKEVHKiXZ_dmni5_eUhE7UPHihU55EG6UKSovBRn7QBEaB448BOVdF3r9vsj9n26inpt-GYqsmivX7-gB83vDfIJk7wlsy3iICPeTfaathh3E7D_eWMyNqyt15qjNRpJhc6lz3GtZ9jwnqMU5OwuH4n80zNPzw' alt='Image associated with police hunt after an asylum seeker was mistakenly released from prison' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Sentence details: Kebatu was sentenced to 12 months in prison after convictions for sexual assaults on a 14-year-old girl and an adult woman .</li><li>Earlier unrest: The assaults earlier this year triggered demonstrations that spread beyond Epping to other towns housing asylum seekers and prompted counter-protests .</li><li>Prison procedures: Prison staff accountability measures have begun: at least one officer was removed from discharge duties while the circumstances of the mistaken release are investigated .</li><li>Police cooperation: Essex police are coordinating with the Metropolitan police and British Transport Police to search for Kebatu and asked the public to report sightings immediately to 999 .</li></ul><blockquote>The mistaken release at His Majesty’s Prison (HMP) Chelmsford is totally unacceptable - Prime Minister Keir Starmer</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Justice Minister David Lammy: The government is working with the police to track the man down and I am appalled by the release.
