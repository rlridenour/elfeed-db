Native Union today debuted the <a href="https://www.nativeunion.com/products/find-it-card?variant=43602402869387">Find It Card</a> and the <a href="https://www.nativeunion.com/products/find-my-tag?variant=43602278252683">Find It Tag</a>, two new products that work with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> functionality.<br/>

Priced at &#36;40, the Find It Card is meant to fit in a wallet, and it measures in at 1.7mm thick. For comparison's sake, a standard credit card is about 0.76mm, so Native Union's card is about two credit cards in thickness. There's a hole in the center where a metal keychain wire attaches, so it can also be attached to items like backpacks.<br/>
<br/>
There is a rechargeable battery inside that can be charged using a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charger or a Qi-based charger, and the battery is able to last for up to six months.<br/>
<br/>
The &#36;20 Find It Tag is shaped like an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a>, featuring a round body and a replaceable CR2032 battery that lasts for up to a year. The Find It Tag has an attached loop that can be added to a keychain or connected to other items for tracking purposes.<br/>

The Find It Card and Find It Tag are both compatible with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, and can be added to the Items tab to be tracked alongside Apple devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. All of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; features are included, and you can get notifications when an item is left behind or play a loud sound to locate an item that's close enough to detect over Bluetooth.<br/>
<br/>
When an item is out of Bluetooth range, the Find It Card and Find It Tag can take advantage of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Network, leveraging nearby Apple products to relay location information back to you.<br/>
