So far, iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-5-beta-features/">are relatively minor updates</a>, introducing just a few new design changes. There are more options for reverting the Mail app back to the prior design, including removing contact photos, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> info is easier to find.
