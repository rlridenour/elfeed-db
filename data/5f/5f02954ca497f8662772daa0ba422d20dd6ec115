Apple is testing a 200-megapixel camera sensor, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a>, a user with a large following on Chinese social media platform Weibo. The account has previously shared accurate information about Apple's future products.<br/>

While the <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PtJ4ZzwhL">account's post today</a> does not provide any further details, this 200-megapixel camera sensor would likely be for the main rear camera on a future high-end iPhone model. Samsung introduced a 200-megapixel rear camera <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/01/samsung-galaxy-s23-lineup/">on its Galaxy S23 Ultra in 2023</a>, and the follow-up S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra models also have one.<br/>
<br/>
With a 200-megapixel camera, an iPhone would be able to shoot photos with greater detail. The increased megapixel count would also result in higher-resolution photos, which can be cropped further and printed at larger sizes without a loss of image quality.<br/>

Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/">entirely 48-megapixel cameras</a>, so the 200-megapixel camera is unlikely to be available this year. In addition, a 200-megapixel camera has yet to be rumored for the iPhone 18 Pro models. Ultimately, the upgraded camera specification could be at least a few years away.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/iphone-200-megapixel-camera-rumor/">iPhone Rumored to Get 200MP Camera Like Samsung&#039;s Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-rumored-to-get-200mp-camera-like-samsungs-galaxy-s25-ultra.2457771/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
