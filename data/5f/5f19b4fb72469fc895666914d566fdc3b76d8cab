<p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2025 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences to American-Israeli Joel Mokyr (half) and to France’s Philippe Aghion and Canada’s Peter Howitt (sharing the other half) for research explaining innovation-driven growth [cnn.com#6][france24.com#5][japantoday.com#1]. The Academy cited Mokyr “for having identified the prerequisites for sustained growth through technological progress” and Aghion and Howitt “for the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction” [cnn.com#6][france24.com#5]. Coverage emphasized that their work quantifies “creative destruction” — how new technologies replace older ones, from steam engines to artificial intelligence, ultimately benefiting society over time [france24.com#4][france24.com#5]. The announcement in Stockholm also marked the end of this year&#x27;s Nobel Prize season [mercopress.com#2].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/0YYV6gHgDbWG--HUZILWJJsmfM8NuO_VlnlyKlHQvxiOQ27rJm5lvGY6_UksfZ-W7BWbJ_LcKEVCtA11Rm0Cw35WsqPXBeDvEc0j9oJXOFzozGjRakWvbgo283B9Bcuf9Csc6sKt8Q6o9ey2rkke8OTvyz-_J5thrRjFTX9nXvM8352dn6Rtj6RMCTzotZH488tdKeqy1U31SDHWe15MMmnFCWC6pQl9IkgFHtG1Yp-UYZaA5bK-Nq38p96s0YuzzFQrR7gu8DCSGUPcJqBd17TNQ9xeAgxxhKCR7Z1ainaHJqJbjvrP7LkoJF5IOUqEqd1VaFKfi5q0mCUbzJ-gbqV6zYn67UPsEFJsObjgxrylVbhf1tA0JNdgxqdaalPTK3drzxBPPjOTRt8kLVccPA' alt='Peter Howitt, co-laureate of the 2025 Nobel in economic sciences.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Prize split: Mokyr receives one half of the prize, while Aghion and Howitt share the other half according to the Academy&#x27;s announcement [cnn.com#6][france24.com#5].</li><li>Mokyr&#x27;s focus: Mokyr was recognized for identifying the prerequisites for sustained economic growth through technological progress [cnn.com#6][japantoday.com#1].</li><li>Creative destruction: Aghion and Howitt were honored for the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction [cnn.com#6][france24.com#5].</li><li>Why it matters: Their work shows how innovations that replace older technologies—like steam engines or AI—can yield long-run benefits [france24.com#4].</li><li>Global trio: The laureates’ backgrounds span American‑Israeli (Mokyr), French (Aghion), and Canadian (Howitt) [france24.com#5][mercopress.com#2].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: The Academy framed the award as recognition for explaining innovation-driven growth, citing Mokyr’s work on technological prerequisites and Aghion‑Howitt’s theory of creative destruction.
