<li>&#8220;From the window behind her, a roscoe poked under the drawn blind. It went: <em>&#8216;Blooey &#8212; Blooey &#8212; Blooey!&#8217;</em>&#8221; (&#8220;Murder on the Sound Stage&#8221;)</li>
<li>&#8220;From the window that opened onto the roof-top sun deck a roscoe sneezed: <em>Ka-Chow! Chowpf!</em> and a red-hot hornet creased its stinger across my dome; bashed me to dreamland.&#8221; (&#8220;Lake of the Left-Hand Moon&#8221;)</li>
