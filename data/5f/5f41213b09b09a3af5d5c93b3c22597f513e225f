<p>The United States circulated a second revision of its UN Security Council draft on Gaza under a silence procedure that ran until 6:30pm New York time on November 13, but Russia and China formally broke that silence and submitted objections, prompting a separate Russian draft to be distributed to council members. The U.S. draft builds on President Trump&#x27;s post-conflict Gaza plan by proposing a foreign-administered &quot;Board of Peace&quot; and an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to manage Gaza during a transitional period and disarm armed groups — elements that have drawn concern from some permanent members and several Arab states because the Palestinian Authority would not have an immediate transitional governing role. Diplomats say breaking silence obliges further negotiations before any vote and increases the likelihood of additional amendments or a veto unless compromises are found.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Nt3D1h_rkshXFTf-izVImWGnuiR6lde4QA3oPqQuCidJx8PnGP_gmFMhxpNH2zJlhVSh0LxsnggdYoEQyNzigitV9U6AZufdEaTlwvRT4NrI' alt='People gather and shop at a local market in Nuseirat, central Gaza Strip, illustrating life and humanitarian needs in Gaza — Reuters/File' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Silence procedure: Under the UN silence procedure, the US left &#x27;Revision 2&#x27; open until 6:30pm New York time on Nov. 13; China and Russia used that moment to lodge formal objections, which allows other members to submit comments and typically forces more talks.</li><li>Pre-vote options: Washington can still convert its text into the final &#x27;in blue&#x27; pre-vote format, but diplomats warned doing so without resolving permanent members&#x27; concerns would likely provoke a veto and renew negotiations.</li><li>Russian framing: Russia&#x27;s counter text says it is &#x27;inspired by the US draft&#x27; yet emphasizes preserving the existing ceasefire and re-affirming a two-state solution as its central features.</li><li>Regional unease: Several Arab delegations and China specifically raised objections to a foreign-administered Board and flagged the absence of an explicit transitional role for the Palestinian Authority as a major concern.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States (U.S. mission to the UN): The U.S. argued the draft was needed to stabilise Gaza and warned that failure to back the plan could result in serious harm to Palestinians, urging council unity behind the proposal.
