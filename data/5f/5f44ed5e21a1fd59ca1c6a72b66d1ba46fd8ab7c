<p>Pope Leo XIV is visiting Lebanon on the second leg of his first foreign trip, bringing a call for peace to a country shaken by spillover from the Gaza war, Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah and years of economic and political crisis. He met Lebanon’s president and prime minister in Beirut and appealed to political and religious leaders to make peace their top priority while rejecting violence carried out in the name of religion. During the flight and in public remarks, he reaffirmed the Vatican’s long‑standing position that a secure Palestinian state alongside Israel is the only viable way to resolve their decades‑long conflict. The pope is also encouraging Lebanon’s substantial Christian community, many of whom are emigrating because of insecurity and economic hardship, to remain in the Middle East and continue contributing to the country’s multi‑faith fabric.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/X-g0XuLXMVkeNRn5WWjFjctqYbAHCmWUsyhcXyrQ5mlTD-5G8l_FmV_SqgJ9FBNPEr_tLoMfYH_xTpWpBO0pEnjWAtK51wOfLYINyuBeEDNFhPgkpMLRydL8JJjJ7KrHVOmfosy_01C3CyzixAWaVqSjUxdTsX5x1qThll8TTrm6Bc6ZsUWIOyfT2fBH3Xz6YmNhykEc' alt='Pope Leo XIV is greeted by Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and First Lady Nehmat Aoun on arrival in Beirut.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Mountain pilgrimage: On day two, Pope Leo traveled in an open popemobile to the mountain village of Annaya to pray at the tomb of Saint Charbel, where thousands lined the winding road, cheering and throwing rice in celebration.</li><li>Mass at port: The pope plans to celebrate Mass at Beirut’s port, a site devastated by a huge explosion five years ago, as a gesture of solidarity with a population still recovering from that disaster.</li><li>Message to youth: Christian youth groups and scouts, including Hezbollah‑linked Imam al‑Mahdi scouts, turned out with Lebanese and Vatican flags, underlining the pope’s effort to reach younger generations across political lines.</li><li>Christian demographics: Lebanon has the highest proportion of Christians in the Middle East and hosts large Syrian and Palestinian refugee communities, putting extra strain on institutions that church leaders hope the visit will help stabilize.</li><li>Diplomatic style: Observers note that during stops in both Turkey and Lebanon, Leo XIV has used notably measured language, carefully avoiding inflammatory terms in settings marked by complex religious and political tensions.</li></ul><blockquote>Lebanon needs the glimmer of hope that this visit brings - Sheikh Sami Abi al-Muna</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pope Leo XIV: He reiterated that establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel is, in the Vatican’s view, the only viable way to end their long‑running conflict and reduce wider regional tensions.
