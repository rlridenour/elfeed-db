<p>The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.75%–4.00%, marking the second quarter-point cut this year as policymakers said they wanted to support a weakening labour market even as inflation remains above the Fed’s target . The decision was made amid limited official data because of the ongoing US government shutdown, which Fed officials said constrained their view of recent labour-market trends . The committee voted 10–2, with two dissenters, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed the path forward is uncertain — a December reduction is not guaranteed .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/xhLDN8NZMvmCAanCZSsirKBXRH3VVdWEQn1vkVk0XxYGHStp9DVvuKDyLjMIRqv-owvgADZkh7vCmgq5klwVoATZYv0cimHGk7HJ4selpPVpxGaL8kpoelTMia7ECGfVbkzTNYUZaHZJUTFIzFXXAEMxyXdOMx0PdLhlKs5g2V0' alt='Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at a public appearance earlier in 2025' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Balance sheet move: Starting Dec. 1 the Fed will reinvest maturing mortgage-backed securities into Treasury bills to keep its holdings stable month-to-month and ease signs of money-market liquidity stress .</li><li>Internal split: Two officials dissented with differing views: Governor Stephen Miran favored a larger 50bp cut, while Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid preferred no change, highlighting a meaningful policy split .</li><li>Data constraints: Officials noted they are relying on indicators dated to August for unemployment because the government shutdown delayed more recent official jobs data, reducing the committee’s incoming-data clarity .</li><li>Market expectations: Markets had priced in an additional reduction in December, making Chair Powell’s warning that a further cut is &#x27;not a foregone conclusion&#x27; an important market signal .</li></ul><blockquote>What do you do if you’re driving in the fog?
