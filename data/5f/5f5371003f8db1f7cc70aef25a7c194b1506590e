<blockquote><p>
&#8216;Who did you pass on the road?&#8217; the King went on, holding out his hand to the Messenger for some more hay.</p>
<p>&#8216;Nobody,&#8217; said the Messenger.</p>
<p>&#8216;Quite right,&#8217; said the King: &#8216;this young lady saw him too. So of course Nobody walks slower than you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I do my best,&#8217; the Messenger said in a sulky tone. &#8216;I&#8217;m sure nobody walks much faster than I do!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;He can&#8217;t do that,&#8217; said the King, &#8216;or else he&#8217;d have been here first.&#8217;
