<p id="p1"><a href="https://irace.me/vibe" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryan Irace has an interesting take</a> on <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the</a> <a href="https://v0.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">new</a> <a href="https://replit.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">generation</a> of <a href="https://codeium.com/windsurf" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer</a> <a href="https://aider.chat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">tools</a> that have lowered the barrier to entry for new developers (and sometimes not even developers) when it comes to creating apps:</p>

  Recent criticism of Apple&rsquo;s AI efforts has been juicy to say the least, but this shouldn&rsquo;t distract us from continuing to criticize one of Apple&rsquo;s most deserving targets: App Review. Especially now that there&rsquo;s a perfectly good AI lens through which to do so.</p>
<p>  It&rsquo;s one thing for Apple&rsquo;s AI <em>product offerings</em> to be non-competitive. Perhaps even worse is that as Apple stands still, software development is moving forward faster than ever before. Like it or not, LLMs&mdash;both through general chat interfaces and purpose-built developer tools&mdash;have meaningfully increased the rate at which new software can be produced. And they&rsquo;ve done so both by making skilled developers more productive while also lowering the bar for less-experienced participants.

<p id="p3">And:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  I recently built a small iOS app for myself. I can install it on my phone directly from Xcode but it expires after seven days because I&rsquo;m using a free Apple Developer account. I&rsquo;m not trying to avoid paying Apple, but there&rsquo;s enough friction involved in switching to a paid account that I simply haven&rsquo;t been bothered. And I used to wrangle provisioning profiles for a living! I can&rsquo;t imagine that I&rsquo;m alone here, or that others with <em>less</em> tribal iOS development knowledge are going to have a higher tolerance for this. A friend asked me to send the app to them but that&rsquo;d involve creating a TestFlight group, submitting a build to Apple, waiting for them to approve it, etc. Compare this to simply pushing to Cloudflare or Netlify and automatically having a URL you can send to a friend or share via Twitter. Or using tools like v0 or Replit, where hosting/distribution are already baked in.</p>
<p>  Again, this isn&rsquo;t new&mdash;but being able to build this much software this fast <em>is</em> new. App distribution friction has stayed constant while friction in <em>all other stages</em> of software development has largely evaporated. It&rsquo;s the difference between inconvenient and untenable.

<p id="p5">Perhaps &ldquo;<a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383" rel="noopener noreferrer">vibe coding</a>&rdquo; is the extreme version of this concept, but I think there&rsquo;s <em>something</em> here. Creating small, low-stakes apps for personal projects or that you want to share with a small group of people is, objectively, getting easier. After reading Bryan&rsquo;s post &ndash; which rightfully focuses on the distribution side of apps &ndash; I&rsquo;m <em>also</em> wondering: what happens when the first big service comes along and figures out a way to <a href="https://replit.com/mobile" rel="noopener noreferrer">bypass</a> the App Store altogether (perhaps <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-ipads-sweet-solution/" rel="noopener noreferrer">via the web</a>?) to allow &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; to create apps, completely cutting out Apple and its App Review from the process?</p>
<p id="p6">In a way, this reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_blogging" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogging</a>. Those who wanted to have an online writing space 30 years ago had to know <em>some</em> of the basics of hosting and HTML if they wanted to publish something for other people to read. Then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blogger</a> came along and allowed <em>anyone</em> &ndash; regardless of their skill level &ndash; to be read. What if the same happened to mobile software? Should Apple and Google be ready for this possibility within the next few years?</p>
<p id="p7">I could see Google spin up a &ldquo;Build with Gemini&rdquo; initiative to let anyone create Android apps without any coding knowledge. I&rsquo;m also reminded of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/27/23574328/apple-ar-apps-siri-mixed-reality-headset" rel="noopener noreferrer">this old Vision Pro rumor</a> that claimed Apple&rsquo;s Vision team was exploring the idea of letting people create &ldquo;apps&rdquo; with Siri.</p>
<p id="p8">If only the person in charge of that team <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/bloomberg-reports-that-apple-is-shaking-up-siri-leadership/" rel="noopener noreferrer">went anywhere</a>, right?</p>
