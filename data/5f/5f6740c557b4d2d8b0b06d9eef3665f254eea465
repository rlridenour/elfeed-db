<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>In contrast to the use cases mentioned in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/">the official documentation</a> my private use of Docker is much more mundane. I mostly need it to extend my tooling.</p>
<p>There is not much missing on my macOS machines to accommodate all of my needs. But in some rare cases I need to have access to some GNU/Linux exclusive software.</p>

<p>On those occasional instances I have grown to rely on docker.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire up a docker container with the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/search?type=image">appropriate image</a>.</li>
<li>Install the needed software in case they are not built in.</li>
<li>Run the task(s) and destroy the container as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;span style=&ldquo;color:#f7821b;&quot;&gt;This is probably better illustrated with an example.&lt;/span&gt;</p>
<h2 id="this-is-not-a-how-to">This is not a how to</h2>
<p>I recently got into a pickle, where I needed to delete A LOT of duplicate mails in my <a href="https://macowners.club/posts/email-emacs-mu4e-macos/">maildir directory</a>.</p>
<p>After an extensive search on the internet, I decided that <a href="http://kremvax.net/howto/mail-duplicates.html">this wonderful post</a> would help me the most.</p>
<p>The only hiccup was that the how-to uses <code>reformail</code> (included in <code>maildrop</code>) which was not available on macOS.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; Docker to the rescue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fired up an Ubuntu image with mapped volumes to my maildir directory.</li>
<li>Installed maildrop.</li>
<li>Performed the steps as mentioned</li>
</ul>
<p>And that was that.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>One cannot deny the usefulness of the container concept. Not just for Devs and/DevOps, but for any type of user.</p>
<p>At work Docker is as much a necessity as my machine itself. But I like Docker much more at home for these one-off tasks – similar to the example above.</p>
<p>But what about Windows software? Just&hellip; No.</p>
