Designed by LA-based Bailey Hikawa to celebrate the 40th anniversary of accessibility at Apple, the grip uses magnets to securely snap onto any iPhone with MagSafe. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says it can be removed with ease, and doubles as a stand with two different viewing angles, in both vertical and horizontal orientations.<br/>
<br/>
Inspired by modern sculpture, the Hikawa's design process involved direct input from individuals with disabilities affecting muscle strength, dexterity, and hand control.<br/>
<br/>
The limited edition Hikawa Phone Grip and Stand is available in two colors: a bold, high-visibility Chartreuse and recycled Crater, exclusive to Apple. <br/>
<br/>
The Hikawa Phone Grip and Stand costs &#36;69.95 and can be ordered from <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/hsbd2zm/a/hikawa-phone-grip-stand-magsafe-compatible">Apple's online store</a> in the U.S. It's the second limited-edition iPhone accessory Apple has released this month, following the high-end designer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/11/apple-launches-iphone-pocket-accessory/">iPhone Pocket</a>, a cross-body pouch starting at &#36;149.95.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/accessibility/">Accessibility</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/21/apple-launches-hikawa-iphone-grip-stand/">Apple Launches Second Limited-Edition iPhone Accessory in a Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-second-limited-edition-iphone-accessory-in-a-month.2471637/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
