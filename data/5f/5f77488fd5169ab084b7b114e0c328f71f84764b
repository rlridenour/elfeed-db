Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Apple offered a line of Wi-Fi routers that it referred to as AirPort base stations. There was a standard AirPort Express, a higher-end AirPort Extreme with more advanced networking features, and an AirPort Time Capsule that doubled as an external storage drive for backing up a Mac with Time Machine.<br/>

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/26/apple-officially-discontinues-airport-wireless-router-lineup/">discontinued the AirPort line</a> in 2018, and this week it shared more sad news that will impact the AirPort Time Capsule specifically.<br/>
<br/>
As noticed <a href="https://x.com/StellaFudge/status/1932449171572998310">by @StellaFudge</a>, and by other users who have installed the first macOS Tahoe beta, the Time Machine page in the System Settings app now indicates that the next major version of macOS — aka macOS 27 — will no longer support the AirPort Time Capsule or any other storage drives that use the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP).<br/>
<br/>
Apple already announced that its AFP client had been deprecated, in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121011">enterprise release notes for macOS Sequoia 15.5</a> last month.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with macOS 27, Time Capsule backups will require a storage drive that supports more current file-sharing protocols like SMBv2 and SMBv3.<br/>
<br/>
macOS 27 will be released next year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airport-time-capsule/">AirPort Time Capsule</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/time-machine/">Time Machine</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/macos-27-wont-support-airport-time-capsule/">Warning: Apple Says macOS 27 Won&#039;t Support AirPort Time Capsule Backups</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/warning-apple-says-macos-27-wont-support-airport-time-capsule-backups.2458637/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
