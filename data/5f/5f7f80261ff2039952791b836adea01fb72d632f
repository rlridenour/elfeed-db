<p>The Pentagon has released a new National Defense Strategy that reorients US defence planning toward protecting the US homeland and prioritising the Western Hemisphere, marking a shift in emphasis compared with recent strategies. The document also signals that Washington will provide “more limited” support to some allies and expects partners to take greater responsibility for their own security, including in Europe and on the Korean peninsula. Officials and outlets describe the strategy as aligning with President Trump’s broader posture, including a focus on practical US interests and reduced reliance on sweeping global commitments.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RTGHQV_KvPunWIKMGkzxCRe9Fdm0UBHfZG6asqqSwBqbIobwPU9wYQa0USj9sx6oi1_Fbjs0DLUpD8AWICnMoohz1DITs8JNhcbGfmNRYvllk0fYRbIJr1RmOcuU8lLvEb_J4wnwrh-IDYRLnGm8wFWYa1Mdae2utHge8SDVDVNH_V_l2Z-Yq3G3f747rYXpPCSiMQ' alt='The Pentagon is reflected on a wall at the U.S. Air Force Memorial in Arlington, Virginia (March 24, 2025).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>China language: Several accounts say the strategy softens tone toward traditional rivals while still aiming to deter China’s ability to act in the Indo-Pacific, framing deterrence as “strength” rather than confrontation.</li><li>Europe support: The document says European NATO members should take primary responsibility for Europe’s conventional defence and lead support for Ukraine, with the US offering critical but more limited backing.</li><li>Korea posture: It envisages a “more limited” US role in deterring North Korea, arguing South Korea is capable of taking primary responsibility as it already hosts about 28,500 US troops and has increased its defence budget this year.</li><li>Western Hemisphere: The strategy highlights concerns about US access and influence over key terrain in the Western Hemisphere, explicitly referencing places such as the Panama Canal, Greenland and the Gulf of Mexico, though reporting notes it offers few operational details.</li><li>Internal debate: POLITICO reports the document’s release followed months of delay and internal debate over how to describe the China threat amid trade talks.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Defense Department: The strategy prioritises defending the US homeland and Western Hemisphere and calls for an “abandonment of grandiose strategies” in favour of “practical interests,” according to reporting on the document.
