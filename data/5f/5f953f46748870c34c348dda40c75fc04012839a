<p>What do you call a person from Connecticut? Today we&#8217;d call them a Connecticuter or a Connecticutian (or, colloquially, a Nutmegger), but in a 1987 address etymologist Allen Walker Read announced that he&#8217;d also found these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connecticotian, used in 1702 by Cotton Mather</li>
<li>Connecticutensian, used in 1781 by historian Samuel Peters</li>
<li>Connectican, used in 1942 in a letter to the <em>Baltimore Evening Sun</em></li>
<li>Connecticutan, used in 1946 by book reviewer John Cournos</li>
<li>Connecticutite, used in 1968 by an anonymous reviewer in <em>Playboy</em></li>
</ul>
<p>He also found several jocular forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connecticutie, a pretty girl of Connecticut (used in 1938 by Frank Sullivan of Mrs. Heywood Broun and in 1947 by a journalist about Clare Boothe Luce)</li>
<li>Connecticanuck, a Connecticut person of French background</li>
<li>Connectikook, an oddball or eccentric from Connecticut</li>
<li>Connecticutup, a prankster from Connecticut</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Especially in language, exuberance accounts for much that happens.&#8221;</p>

He gives his documentation in &#8220;What Connecticut People Can Call Themselves,&#8221; <em>Connecticut Onomastic Review</em> No. 2, 1981, 3­-23. In 1992 he took up the same question regarding <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2015/04/10/me-a-name-i-call-myself/">&#8220;Americans.&#8221;</a>)</p>
