This is also a cross post for the <a href="https://www.nicksimson.com/posts/2025-indieweb-carnival-take-two.html">IndieWeb Carnival: Take Two</a> which was the original inspiration behind the Emacs Carnival.

<p>I started using Emacs about 20 years ago. From the start I was heavily involved in the Emacs IRC channel and the Org mode mailing list. I contributed the refresh of the Org mode logo to Dr. Carsten Dominik and the community as a small thank you for such a great package. All my notes were stored in Org mode files, along with my task lists. For development I used Elpy for Python and Webmode for anything HTML and Javascript. Elpy was good enough for me back then. Webmode was just ok but had a lot of problems with javascript. I jumped over to LSP mode pretty early and that solved a lot of problems with Python but it was a pain to configure and broke at the most inconvenient times. I was frustrated a lot of the time I was trying to work.</p>
<p>Around 2015 I was introduced to PyCharm by a client. The debugger was fantastic and hooked me quickly. It replaced a lot of what I was using Emacs for. I still used Emacs but jumped back and forth between the two (a lot of things are just easier in Emacs). Around the same time I started working with React and I could never get anything working well in Emacs, but PyCharm just worked. So I stayed with PyCharm for many years (mostly). All my notes were still stored in Org mode files (and most still are). I still have notes in org files from nearly 20 years ago. I can&#39;t say that about any other notes apps.</p>
<p>When Eglot started gaining momentum I decided to see what it could do. I was pleasantly surprised but it did not fully bring me back. It was still easier to just use PyCharm. PyCharm is a great IDE but I find IDEs too opinionated. I always had the itch to return to Emacs for all my development needs. A year or two ago I decided to give Eglot another try. It had matured - or perhaps I had. I played around with the available options for LSP and found Pyright to be very good. I was able to get my Emacs config to provide me with most of what PyCharm was handling. When I finally upgraded Emacs from 29 to 30, I stopped using PyCharm. With Eglot, the current options for Language Servers, and Tree-sitter I now have a stable environment for Python/Django work as well as React. I&#39;m now comfortable with my environment.</p>
<p>Currently, I&#39;m using Eglot with <a href="https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright">Basedpyright Language Server</a> and Ruff for linting. For React/Javascript I&#39;m using the Typescript Language Server. Below is my current Eglot config. It has taken many iterations to get it where I&#39;m happy with it. I still need to add JS linting to it but for now that&#39;s mostly covered in my pre-commit hooks.</p>
