<p>The United States says it has begun initial steps that could lead to a phased reopening of its embassy in Caracas following Nicolas Maduro’s ouster, signaling a cautious reset in bilateral relations. In parallel, reports and official statements indicate Washington is easing pressure through broader sanctions relief for Venezuela’s oil sector and by starting to release some previously frozen Venezuelan assets. Venezuelan acting president Delcy Rodríguez has described renewed diplomatic contacts with the Trump administration and said the US is unfreezing sanctioned funds, moves that could help Venezuela stabilize key state finances and rebuild international economic ties if they continue.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8XRA8vbwKSfYIMN5RccMPdcs4X0w5-zQneMod_TFF1-Z4Y58zzs_h_xWpAgSLklyBBp_WQ4wzSSiGs7aOGJ56-xm7M5IpINO-DV-hRQ2zyjA3RHIDP9jcVk1w7DUWFNBW4eyGtBzWq5ufu1z4duf3gqjQEuW3EpwYYuel0quCToclif0VAPeujlIYskj-bmZ1PAGLPEj20OSu2mBKX1dBhraxhHOgwn3W9u-k1ebWesIdlnz6w4GE0Sr9t_a50HGNkh1BrSUghPdlCuaNotNjiY' alt='Image accompanying reporting on US first steps toward potentially reopening Embassy Caracas after Maduro’s ouster.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Phased embassy plan: The State Department notified Congress it intends a “phased approach” that could eventually resume operations at Embassy Caracas.</li><li>Post-ouster context: Le Monde reports the Trump administration is exploring restored relations in the wake of a US military raid that deposed then-president Nicolas Maduro.</li><li>Oil licensing shift: Firstpost reports Washington plans to move from company-by-company waivers to a general license designed to support Venezuela’s oil exports and attract investment.</li><li>Asset releases: Delcy Rodríguez said the United States is unfreezing funds previously blocked under sanctions, alongside renewed diplomatic contacts between the countries.</li><li>Public pushback: Le Monde notes activists in Washington staged a projection opposing oil-driven intervention and the use of US taxpayer dollars to subsidize large oil companies ahead of President Trump’s meeting with US oil executives.</li></ul><blockquote>We are writing to notify the committee of the Department of State’s intent to implement a phased approach to potentially resume Embassy Caracas operations, - U.S. Department of State</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. Department of State: It told Congress it intends a phased approach that could eventually resume Embassy Caracas operations after Maduro’s ouster.
