<li>The caps have 4 LEDs in each (48 lumens), whereas the beanies feature 1 75-lumen LED (though it has lower settings too)</li>
<li>Caps are powered by 4 CR2032 batteries (which are included and easy to replace); beanies run on 2 AAA batteries (also included and easy to replace)</li>
<li>Battery life: ~43 hours for the caps; ~12.5 hours for the beanies</li>
<li>Beanies are water-resistant and washable</li>
<li>Either option provides about 45 feet of visibility</li>
<li>Is it Mac compatible: If you need an LED hat to see what’s on your iPhone screen, you probably need to adjust your brightness or get a new phone</li>
</ul><h1>Get Light-Headed</h1><p>So, you see two baseball caps–each with 4 LEDs built into the brim, for a total output of 48 lumens–or beanies–each with 1 LED capable of 75 lumens–and you think, <em>What are those even for?</em></p>
<p>And the answer is simple. They’re for doing stuff like this:</p>

<p>Of course, I’m providing these images from the manufacturer’s page for <em>your</em> benefit. For me, personally, I knew immediately that these were products for carrying out really cool, manly tasks, because that’s just the kind of person I am: a very manly dude. So I would use these hats in the ways shown above. Bow hunting in the small hours of the morning. Summiting peaks before sunrise. Building a fire at my remote campsite.</p>
<p>I would never use one for something mundane and wimpy. Like, for example, going out to my car at night when it’s parked on the street, because I left my water bottle in the cupholder, and lord knows, if I have it on my bedside table at night, I’ll get good rest, but if it’s not there, I’ll wake five times with a mouth like a desert, gasping for hydration that isn’t within easy reach.</p>
<p>Or, another thing I wouldn’t use this for: finding my dog’s poop after his final nighttime trip out into the backyard to do his business, thus keeping the grass clear of potential hazards. (And yes, I could let it go just once and get it in the morning, but every downward spiral into depravity starts with giving yourself that kind of permission, doesn’t it? “It’ll be fine, just this once.” Then it’s one more night without picking it up. Then one more after that. And next thing you know, your lawn is a superfund site of dog turds.)</p>
<p>And I definitely would not wear one of these hats into the basement to grab something from the laundry room, a trip which always involves a little bit of darkness (due to inadequate lighting and poor switch placement) that’s spooky enough <em>any</em> night but especially spook now, when I just watched a scary movie on Halloween three months ago.</p>
<p>Yep, those wouldn’t be what I use these hats for. Just cool-guy for me, thank you very much.</p>
<p>But you can use them for whatever you want.</p>
