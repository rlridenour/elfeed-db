<p>
I've been enjoying reading people's responses to the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Carnival">Emacs Carnival</a> July theme of <a href="https://gregnewman.io/blog/emacs-carnival-2025-07-writing-experience/">writing experience</a>. I know I don't need complicated tools to write. People can write in composition notebooks and on typewriters. But I have fun learning more about the Emacs text editor and tweaking it to support me. Writing is one of the ways I think, and I want to think better. I'll start with the kinds of things I write in my public and private notes, and then I'll think about Emacs specifically.

<div id="outline-container-orgb716c7c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb716c7c">Emacs News</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb716c7c">
<p>
I put together a <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/category/emacs-news">weekly list of categorized links</a> about the interesting ways people use Emacs. This takes me about an hour or two each week. I enjoy collecting all these little examples of people's curiosity and ingenuity. Organizing the links into a list helps people find things they might be interested in and connect with other people.
</p>

<p>
I start by skimming <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/">r/emacs</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/">r/orgmode</a> on my phone, upvoting posts that I want to include. I also search YouTube and add videos to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4th0AZixyREOtvxDpdxC9oMuX7Ar7Sdt">Emacs News playlist</a>. I review <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com">aggregated posts from Planet Emacslife</a>. I have an Emacs Lisp function that <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sachac/emacs-news/refs/heads/master/index.org#:~:text=(defun%20my%2Dprepare%2Demacs%2Dnews%20(date%20parts)">collects all the data</a> and formats them as a list, with all the items at the same level.
</p>

<p>
For Mastodon, I check <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#mastodon-combined-timeline">#emacs search results</a> from a few different servers. I have a keyboard shortcut that <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/09/collecting-emacs-news-from-mastodon/#mastodon-news">boosts a post and captures the text</a> to an Org Mode file, and then I have another function that prompts me to <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs/index.html#mastodon-news:~:text=makes%20that%20happen:-,(defun%20my%2Demacs%2Dnews%2Dsummarize%2Dmastodon%2Ditems%20(),-(interactive)">summarize toots</a>, defaulting to the title of the first link. I have more functions that help me <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sachac/emacs-news/refs/heads/master/index.org#:~:text=(defvar%20my%2Demacs%2Dnews%2Dduplicate%2Doverlay%20nil)-,(defun%20my%2Demacs%2Dnews%2Dcheck%2Dduplicates%20(),-(interactive)">detect duplicates</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sachac/emacs-news/refs/heads/master/index.org#:~:text=Making%20a%20numpad%2Dbased%20hydra%20for%20organizing%20Emacs%20News">categorize links</a>. I use <a href="https://github.com/sachac/ox-11ty">ox-11ty</a> to export the post to my blog, which uses the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> static site generator. I also use <a href="https://github.com/emacstv/emacstv.github.io/blob/main/emacstv.el">emacstv.el</a> to add the videos to the <a href="https://github.com/emacstv/emacstv.github.io/blob/main/videos.org">Org file</a> I use for <a href="https://emacs.tv/">emacs.tv</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some ways to improve this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I probably have enough data that it might be interesting to learn how to write a classifier. On the other hand, regular expression matches on the titles get most of them correctly, so that might be sufficient.</li>
<li>YouTube videos are a little annoying to go through because of interface limitations and unrelated or low-effort videos. I can probably figure out something that checks the RSS feeds of various channels.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgef8af90" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgef8af90">Bike Brigade newsletter</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgef8af90">
<p>
I also put together a weekly newsletter for <a href="https://www.bikebrigade.ca/">Bike Brigade</a>, which coordinates volunteer cyclists to deliver food bank hampers and other essentials. Writing this mostly involves collecting ideas from a number of social media feeds as well as the other volunteers in the community, putting together a draft, and then copying it over to Mailchimp. I'm still figuring out my timing and workflows so that I can stay on top of last-minute requests coming in from people on Slack, and so that I can repurpose newsletter items as updates in the Facebook group or maybe even a blog. If I set aside some regular time to work on things, like a Sunday morning sweep for last-minute requests, that might make it easier to work with other people.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0272bad" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0272bad">Tech notes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0272bad">
<p>
I like coding, and I come up with lots of ideas as I use my computer. I enjoy figuring out workflow tweaks like <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/07/emacs-open-urls-or-search-the-web-plus-browse-url-handlers/">opening lots of URLs in a region</a> or  <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/06/transforming-html-clipboard-contents-with-emacs-to-smooth-out-mailchimp-annoyances-dates-images-comments-colours/">transforming HTML clipboard contents</a>. My Org files have accumulated quite a few. My main limiting factor here is actually sitting down to make those things happen. Fortunately, I have recently discovered that it's possible for me to spend an hour or two a day playing Stardew Valley, so I can swap some of that time for Emacs tweaking instead. Coding doesn't handle interruptions as well as playing does, but taking notes along the way might be able to help with that. I can jump to the section of my Org file with the ideas I wanted to save for more focus time, pick something from that screen, and get right to it.
</p>

<p>
Other things that might help me do this more effectively would be:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>getting better at using my tools (debugger, documentation, completion, etc.),</li>
<li>taking the opportunity to plug in an external monitor, and</li>
<li>using my non-computer time to mull over the ideas so that I can hit the ground running.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I like taking notes at virtual meetups. I usually do this with Etherpad so that other people can contribute to the notes too. I don't have a real-time read-write Emacs interface to this yet (that would be way cool!), but I do have some functions for <a href="https://git.emacsconf.org/emacsconf-el/tree/emacsconf-pad.el">working with the Etherpad text</a>.

<h4 id="org9d448e6">Life reflections</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9d448e6">
<p>
When I notice something I want to figure out or remember, I use <a href="https://sketches.sachachua.com">sketches</a>, audio braindumps, or typing to start to untangle that thought. Sometimes I use all three, shifting from one tool to another depending on what I can do at the moment. I have a pretty comfortable workflow for <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2023/01/recolor-rename-and-file-my-sketches-automatically/">converting sketches (Google Vision)</a> or <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/11/updating-my-audio-braindump-workflow-to-take-advantage-of-whisperx/">audio (OpenAI Whisper)</a> to text so that I can work with it more easily, and I'm sure that will get even smoother as the technology improves. I switch from one tool to another as I <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/07/finding-the-shape-of-my-thoughts/">figure out the shape of my thoughts</a>.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I can use microblogging to let smaller ideas out into the world, just in case conversations build them up into more  interesting ideas. I don't quite trust my ability to manage my <a href="https://social.sachachua.com">GoToSocial</a> instance yet (backups? upgrades?), so that might be a good reason to use a weekly or monthly review to revisit and <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/09/archiving-public-toots-on-my-blog/">archive those posts</a> in plain text.
</p>

<p>
I've been reading my <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/on-this-day/">on this day</a> list of blog posts and sketches more regularly now that it's in my feed reader. I like the way this helps me revisit old thoughts, and I've saved a few that I want to follow up on. It feels good to build on a thought over time.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to do more of this remembering and thinking out loud because memories are fleeting. Maybe developing more trust in my private journals and files will help. (Gotta have those backups!) Then I'll be more comfortable writing about the things we're figuring out about life while also respecting A+ and W-'s privacy, and I can post the stuff I'm figuring out about my life that I'm okay with sharing. I might think something is straightforward, like A+'s progress in learning how to swim. I want to write about how that's a microcosm of how she's learning how to learn more independently and my changing role in supporting her. Still, she might have other opinions about my sharing that, either now or later on. I can still reflect on it and keep that in a private journal as we figure things out together.
</p>

<p>
Even though parenting takes up most of my time and attention at the moment, it will eventually take less. There are plenty of things for me to learn about and share outside parenting, like biking, gardening, and sewing. I've got books to read and ideas to try out.
</p>

<p>
I'm experimenting with doing more writing on my phone so that I can get better at using these little bits of time. Swiping letters on a keyboard is reasonably fast, and the bottleneck is my thinking time anyway. I use <a href="https://www.orgzlyrevived.com/">Orgzly Revived</a> so that <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> can synchronize it with my Org Mode files on my laptop when I get back home. There are occasional conflicts, but since I mostly add to an inbox.org when I'm on my phone, the conflicts are usually <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#syncthing">easy to resolve</a>.
</p>

<p>
Adding doodles to my reflections can make them more fun. I can draw stick figures from scratch, and I can also trace my photos using the iPad as a way to add visual anchors and practise drawing. If I get the hang of using a smaller portion of my screen like the way I used to draw index cards, that might make thoughts more granular and easier to complete.
</p>

<p>
When I write on my computer, I often use <a href="https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode">writeroom-mode</a> so that things feel less cluttered. I like having big margins and short lines. I have <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/hl-line.el">hl-line-mode</a> turned on to help me focus on the current paragraph. This seems to work reasonably well.
</p>

<h4 id="org8ff9820">Monthly and yearly reviews</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8ff9820">
<p>
I like the rhythm of <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2023/12/2023-12-30-01-daily-moments-drawing/">drawing daily moments</a> and keeping a web-based journal of brief descriptions of our day. I like how I've been digging into them deeper to reflect on themes. The monthly drawings and posts make it easier to review a whole year. Maybe someday I'll get back to weekly reviews as well, but for now, this is working fine.
</p>

<p>
My journal entries do a decent job of capturing the facts of our days: where we went, what we did. Maybe spending more time writing life reflections can help me capture more of what goes on in my head and what I want to learn more about.

<div id="outline-container-org082fd18" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org082fd18">Book notes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org082fd18">
<p>
I draw <a href="https://sachachua.com/topic/visual-book-notes/">single-page summaries</a> of books I like because they're easier to remember and share. E-books are convenient because I can highlight text and extract that data even after I've returned the book, but I can also retype things from paper books or use the text recognition feature on my phone camera. I draw the summaries on my iPad using <a href="https://www.getnoteful.com/">Noteful</a>, and then I run it through <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2023/01/recolor-rename-and-file-my-sketches-automatically/">my Google Vision workflow</a> to convert the text from it so that I can include it in a blog post.
</p>

<p>
The main limiting factor here is my patience in reading a book. There are so many other wonderful things to explore, and sometimes it feels like books have a bit of filler. When I have a clear topic I'm curious about or a well-written book to enjoy, it's easier to study a book and make notes.

<div id="outline-container-org719c3e1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org719c3e1">Emacs workflow thoughts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org719c3e1">
<p>
Aside from considering the different types of writing I do, I've also been thinking about the mechanics of writing in Emacs. Sanding down the rough parts of my workflow makes writing more enjoyable, and sometimes a small tweak lets me squeeze more writing into fragments of time.
</p>

<p>
There are more commands I want to call than there are keyboard shortcuts I can remember. I tend to use <code>M-x</code> to call commands by name a lot, and it really helps to have some kind of completion (I use <a href="https://github.com/minad/vertico">vertico</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/oantolin/orderless">orderless</a> matching.
</p>

<p>
I'm experimenting with more voice input because that lets me braindump ideas quickly on my phone. Long dictation sessions are a little difficult to edit. Maybe shorter snippets using the voice input mode on the phone keyboard will let me flesh out parts of my outline. I wonder if the same kind of quick input might be handy on my computer. I'm trying out  <a href="https://github.com/natrys/whisper.el">whisper.el</a> with my Bluetooth earbuds. Dictating tends to be stop-and-go, since I feel self-conscious about dictating when other people are around and I probably only have solo time late at night.
</p>

<p>
Misrecognized words can be annoying to correct on my phone. They're much easier to fix on my computer. Some corrections are pretty common, like changing Emax to Emacs. I wrote some code for fixing common errors (<a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#edit-text">my-subed-fix-common-errors</a>), but I don't use this often enough to have it in my muscle memory. I probably need to tweak this so that it's a bit more interactive and trustworthy.
</p>

<p>
When I see a word I want to change, I jump to it with <code>C-s</code> (<code>isearch-forward</code>) or <code>C-r</code> (<code>isearch-backward</code>), or I navigate to it with <code>M-f</code> (<code>forward-word</code>). I want to get the hang of using <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/avy">Avy</a> because of <a href="https://karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/">Karthik's awesome post about it</a>. That post is from 2021 and I still haven't gotten used to it. I probably just need deliberate practice using the  shortcut I've mapped to <code>M-j</code> (<code>avy-goto-char-timer</code>). Or maybe I just don't do this kind of navigation enough yet to justify this micro-optimization (no matter how neat it could be), and isearch is fine for now.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I want to work with sentences. <a href="https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el">expand-region</a> is another thing I want to get used to. I've bound <code>C-=</code> to <code>er/expand-region</code> from that package. Then I should be able to easily kill the text and type a replacement or move things around. In the meantime, I can usually remember to use my keyboard shortcut of <code>M-z</code> for <code>avy-zap-up-to-char-dwim</code> for deleting something.
</p>

<p>
Even in vanilla Emacs, there's so much that I think I'll enjoy getting the hang of. <a href="https://www.matem.unam.mx/~omar/apropos-emacs.html#writing-experience">oantolin's post on his writing experience</a> helped me learn about <code>M-E</code>, which marks the region from the point to the end of the sentence and is a natural extension from <code>M-e</code>. Similarly, <code>M-F</code> selects the next word.  I could use this kind of shift-selection more. I occasionally remember to transpose words with <code>M-t</code>, but I've been cutting and pasting sentences when I could've been using <code>transpose-sentences</code> all this time. I'm going to add <code>(keymap-global-set "M-T" #'transpose-sentences)</code> to my config and see if I remember it.
</p>

<p>
I like using Org Mode headings to collapse long text into a quick overview so I can see the big picture, and they're also handy for making <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/04/adding-subheadings-and-sketches-to-my-blog-page-navigation/">tables of contents</a>. It might be neat to have one more level of overview below that, maybe displaying only the first line of each paragraph. In the meantime, I can use <code>toggle-truncate-lines</code> to get that sort of view.
</p>

<p>
If I'm having a hard time fitting the whole shape of a thought into my working memory, I sometimes find it easier to work with plain list outlines that go all the way down to sentences instead of working with paragraphs. I can expand/collapse items and move them around easily using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/org.html#Plain-Lists">Org's commands for list items</a>. In addition, <code>org-toggle-item</code> toggles between items and plain text, and <code>org-toggle-heading</code> can turn items into headings.
</p>

<p>
I could probably write a command that toggles a whole section between an outline and a collection of paragraphs. The outline would be a plain list with two levels. The top level items would be the starting sentences of each paragraph, and each sentence after that would be a list item underneath it. Sometimes I use actual lists. Maybe those would be a third level. Then I can use Org Mode's handy list management commands even when a draft is further along. Alternatively, maybe I can use <code>M-S-left</code> and <code>M-S-right</code> to move sentences around in a paragraph.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I write something and then change my mind about including it. Right now, I tend to either use <code>org-capture</code> to save it or put it under a heading and then refile it to my Scraps subtree, but the <a href="https://github.com/danielsz/Palimpsest">palimpsest</a> approach might be interesting. Maybe a shortcut to stash the current paragraph somewhere&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I use custom Org link types to make it easier to link to <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#org-mode-publishing-11ty-static-site-generation-linking-to-blog-topics">topics</a>, <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/01/using-an-emacs-lisp-macro-to-define-quick-custom-org-mode-links-to-project-files/#git-projects">project files</a>, <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#links-to-my-config">parts of my Emacs configuration</a>, <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#linking-to-blog-posts">blog posts</a>, <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#org-mode-sketch-links">sketches</a>, <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#videos">videos</a>, and more. It's handy to have completion, and I can define how I want them to be exported or followed.
</p>

Custom Org link types also let me use <a href="https://github.com/oantolin/embark">Embark</a> for context-sensitive actions. For example, I have a command for <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#org-mode-publishing-11ty-static-site-generation-linking-to-blog-posts-making-it-easier-to-add-a-category-to-a-blog-post">adding categories to a blog post</a> when my cursor is on a link to the post, which is handy when I've <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#org-mode-publishing-11ty-static-site-generation-linking-to-blog-posts-list-all-blog-posts-that-match-a-category-or-title-search">made a list of matching posts</a>. Embark is also convenient for doing things from other commands. It's nice being able to use <code>C-. i</code> to insert whatever's in the minibuffer, so I can use that from <code>C-h f</code> (<code>describe-function</code>), <code>C-h v</code> (<code>describe-variable</code>), or other commands.

I also <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#special-blocks">define custom Org block types</a> using <a href="https://github.com/alhassy/org-special-block-extras">org-special-block-extras</a>. This lets me easily make things like collapsible sections with summaries.

I want to get better at diagrams and charts using things like <a href="https://graphviz.org/">graphviz</a>, <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/">mermaidjs</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>, and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/">seaborn</a>. I usually end up searching for an example I can build on and then try to tweak it. Sometimes I just draw something on my iPad and stick it in. It's fine. I think it would be good to learn computer-based diagramming and charting, though. They can be easier to update and re-layout when I realize I've forgotten to add something to the graph.

<a href="https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/matplotllm/">Figuring out the proper syntax for diagrams and charts</a> might be one of the reasonable use cases for large-language models, actually. I'm on the fence about LLMs in general. I sometimes use claude.ai for dealing with the occasional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue">tip of the tongue</a> situation like "What's a word or phrase that describes&#x2026;" and for catching when I've forgotten to finish a sentence. I don't think I can get it to think or write like me yet. Besides, I like doing the thinking and writing.

<p>
I love reading about other people's workflows. If they share their code, that's fantastic, but even descriptions of ideas are fine. I learn so many things from the blog posts I come across on <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com">Planet Emacslife</a> in the process of putting together Emacs News. I also periodically go through documentation like the <a href="https://orgmode.org/org.html">Org Mode manual</a> or <a href="https://orgmode.org/Changes.html">release notes</a>, and I always learn something new each time.
</p>

<p>
This post was really hard to write! I keep thinking of things I want to start tweaking. I treat Emacs-tweaking as a fun hobby that sometimes happens to make things better for me or for other people, so it's okay to capture lots of ideas to explore later on. Sometimes something is just a quick 5-minute hack. Sometimes I end up delving into the source code, which is easy to do because hey, it's Emacs. It's <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2020/07/why-i-love-free-software/">comforting and inspiring</a> to be surrounded by all this parenthetical evidence of other people's thinking about their workflows.
</p>

<p>
Each type of writing helps me with a different type of thinking, and each config tweak makes thoughts flow more smoothly. I'm looking forward to learning how to think better, one note at a time.
