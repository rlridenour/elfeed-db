<p>&#8220;For the first time in human history, we are no longer alone in the space of general intelligence.&#8221; <span id="more-56432"></span></p>

<p>In the piece, <a href="https://www.eddykemingchen.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eddy Keming Chen</a> (Philosophy, UCSD), <a href="http://misha.belkin-wang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mikhail Belkin</a> (Computer Science, UCSD), <a href="https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/profiles/leon-bergen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leon Bergen</a> (Linguistics, UCSD), and <a href="https://www.daviddanks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Danks</a> (Philosophy, UVA) offer what they think is a reasonable clarification of the idea of general intelligence (AGI), evidence that today&#8217;s AI fits with this clarified definition, address an array of objections, and discuss why this is important. You can read the article <a href="https://rdcu.be/e1Vgn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>They acknowledge that when it comes to general intelligence, &#8220;there is no ‘bright line’ test for its presence&#8212;any exact threshold is inevitably arbitrary&#8221;. Still, progress in figuring out what has general intelligence is possible, since, &#8220;we recognize paradigm cases without needing exact boundaries.&#8221; For example, &#8220;humans are paradigm examples of general intelligence; a pocket calculator lacks it, despite superhuman ability at calculations.&#8221;</p>
<p>In assessing what has general intelligence, we need to make sure we&#8217;re not demanding more for non-humans than for humans, they think. So when it comes to methodology, they say: &#8220;When we assess general intelligence or ability in other humans, we do not attempt to peer inside their heads to verify understanding&#8212;we infer it from behaviour, conversation and problem-solving. No single test is definitive, but evidence accumulates. The same applies to artificial systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>They then survey some of that evidence, observing that some current AI&#8217;s perform not just at &#8220;Turing-test level&#8221; proficiency but in ways comparable to expert humans. They note that &#8220;current LLMs even exceed what we demand of humans: we credit individual people with general intelligence on the basis of much weaker evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>They also respond to various objections, such as: LLMs are just stochastic parrots, LLMs lack world models, LLMs only understand words, LLMs lack agency, LLMs lack a sense of self, LLMs &#8220;hallucinate&#8221;, and others.</p>
<p>As for the significance of AGI, the authors write:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Nicolaus Copernicus displaced humans from the centre of the cosmos. Darwin displaced humans from a privileged place in nature. Turing suggested that humans might not embody the only way to be intelligent. The machines Turing envisioned 75 years ago have finally arrived, in a form both more alien and more human than anyone imagined. Like those earlier revolutions, this one invites us to rethink our standing&#8230; Our place in the world, and our understanding of mind, will not be the same.</em></p>
