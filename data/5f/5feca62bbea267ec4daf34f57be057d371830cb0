<p>In 1964—a year before the release of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZtrgRejwG0&amp;list=RDPZtrgRejwG0&amp;start_radio=1"><em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em></a>—<a href="https://www.openculture.com/2023/12/an-introduction-to-vince-guaraldi-the-jazz-composer-who-created-the-best-christmas-album-ever-a-charlie-brown-christmas.html">Vince Guaraldi</a> gave the first televised performance of “<a href="https://youtu.be/x6zypc_LhnM?si=yfP9y1-XZhX_z3Yc">Linus and Lucy</a>.” Filmed for public television, the performance featured Guaraldi on piano, Tom Beeson on bass, and John Rae on drums. Long unseen, this 1964 performance captures the piece in its earliest televised form, well before <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> became the second-best-selling jazz album in history. Sit back, take a deep breath, and enjoy this groovy, historic performance.</p>
