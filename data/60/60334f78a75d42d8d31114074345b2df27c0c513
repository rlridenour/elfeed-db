<p>April 10th will mark the 100th anniversary of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic American novel, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64317"><em>The Great Gatsby</em></a>. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/27/books/great-gatsby-100.html?unlocked_article_code=1.704.NFFT.1jEDw3bRNXxO&amp;smid=url-share">A.O. Scott notes</a> in a recent tribute, when first published, <em>The Great Gatsby</em> got off to a slow start. Initially, “Reviewers shrugged. Sales were sluggish. The novel and its author slid toward obscurity.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the 1940s that Gatsby underwent a revival. Critics began to re-evaluate Fitzgerald’s novel, and the U.S. military “distributed more than 150,000 copies of ‘Gatsby’<em>&nbsp;</em>to American servicemen during World War II,” all to <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2013/05/09/a-novel-fact-wartime-and-the-u-s-military-boosted-sales-of-the-great-gatsby-from-good-to-great/">help bored soldiers kill time</a>. From there, Gatsby’s “cultural footprint expanded. Paperback editions proliferated, and the novel was name-checked by younger authors, including J.D. Salinger.” Today, with some 30 million copies sold worldwide and at least five film adaptations to its name, <em>The Great Gatsby</em> has established itself as an enduring American classic.</p>
<p>In January 2021, <em>The Great Gatsby</em> finally <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2021/01/the-great-gatsby-is-now-in-the-public-domain-and-theres-a-new-graphic-novel.html">entered the public domain</a>, allowing creators to make use of the literary work in different ways. As our writer Colin Marshall noted, “Already you can find <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3ov2OUW">The Gay Gatsby</a>,</em>&nbsp;B.A. Baker’s slash fiction reinterpretation of all the suppressed longing in the original novel;&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/39sHeMN"><em>The Great Gatsby Undead</em></a>, a zombie version; and&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3oqTUrx">Michael Farris Smith’s&nbsp;<em>Nick</em></a>, a prequel that follows Nick Carraway through World War I and out the other side.” And then there are more straightforward projects–like <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64317">Project Gutenberg’s e‑book of the original text</a>, or this free audio book version of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>.
