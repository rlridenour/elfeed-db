Amazon has the 2025 11-inch iPad available for &#36;299 this week, which is a &#36;50 discount off of the regular price. If you're looking for an entry-level iPad that's affordable yet still plenty powerful enough for day to day tasks, the 2025 iPad is what you want.<br/>

The iPad works with the USB-C Apple Pencil, which you can pick up from Amazon for &#36;69. It's not too much of a discount, but the Apple Pencil rarely comes down in price.<br/>

It's a good time to buy an iPad because it was just refreshed earlier this year with a faster A16 chip, and we're not expecting a new model until 2026.<br/>
