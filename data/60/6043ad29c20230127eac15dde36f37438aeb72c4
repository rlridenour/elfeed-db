<p>Large demonstrations in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, protested an expanded immigration enforcement presence under President Trump, with many participants braving sub-zero weather. Faith leaders and labor groups also backed an “economic strike,” with hundreds of Minnesota businesses closing for the day in solidarity. Police arrested about 100 clergy members during a protest at Minnesota’s largest airport, where demonstrators objected to deportation flights and urged airlines to oppose the enforcement operation. Anger has also focused on the reported detention of a 5-year-old boy, which several outlets say helped galvanize the protests.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DVZL9BYVRzaFfWPnLmmVL1XFmwEB1pk0DfFINsLh_RDHYxALXhM0OJyVZ-apVCJ9b8IkdaRIH6Zf6MNp5zmvV9ipsBOko0lEzr1svJmOkg0qEL4eU2zyAtqTOmUKq6KOhMAw4D15Pdre8U2uR26r-IuSRZZvSRj6glbhzphTnmWTxvM72n1CzfArcksvLcASC8R0cFr8F1zwuXAEU_COHawTvtbg__qILLlNo1hwsViR2xXr6zXDmvmpZ66UzrB_qSFx-fFvtv_GF_VDxQ' alt='People rally during a general strike in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on January 23, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Airport arrests: Clergy demonstrated at Minnesota’s largest airport against deportation flights, and police detained roughly 100 of them, according to reports describing the action as nonviolent civil disobedience.</li><li>“Economic strike”: Organizers described the action as a general strike or “economic blackout,” urging people to skip work, school and shopping as a show of opposition to the immigration crackdown.</li><li>Child detention: Several reports linked the protests’ intensity to outrage over the detention of a 5-year-old boy, which prompted broader scrutiny of how enforcement actions affect families.</li><li>Scale of operation: The Department of Homeland Security characterized the effort as its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation, a framing cited in coverage of the Minnesota demonstrations.</li><li>Cold-weather turnout: Crowds still gathered outdoors despite Arctic conditions, highlighting strong local mobilization and support networks that helped people show up safely.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Protest organizers (faith and labor groups): Organizers say the increased ICE presence is harming communities and used a general strike and public rallies to demand an end to the crackdown and deportation flights.
