<p>Heavy cross-border fighting erupted along the Afghanistan–Pakistan frontier over the weekend, with the Taliban government claiming its forces killed at least 58 Pakistani soldiers in retaliatory strikes for alleged violations of Afghan territory and airspace [abcnews.go.com#1][ndtv.com#1]. Pakistan, meanwhile, said it had captured 19 Afghan border posts during the clashes, and at least 23 Pakistani soldiers and nine Afghan soldiers were reported killed, underscoring conflicting claims and significant losses on both sides [aljazeera.com#1]. Pakistan closed crossings along the roughly 2,600-km border, halting trade, and trucks were seen parked at the shut Torkham crossing, a key commercial artery between the two countries [straitstimes.com#1][nytimes.com#1]. Analysts warned the escalation is the sharpest in years and risks a broader conflict if not contained, even as the vital economic ties at the border offer a practical incentive for de-escalation and dialogue [nytimes.com#1][straitstimes.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/EbrIG0GCYHsPcmyjzVifJvY0uRAEfS6px1gYxVFfN3iQ8dm3uMfNLj7cu9SenJHDN4ZswhXYK1hHoMxRtGLYzEgco-tlPCZh621OZFyNVyfV7KsfQqE5BUjY6zYw8gnGGDzepspY6rblcrp0kL1AzBoJ4iB9Dtqvx0ZjiWoRmiWzn9ecA41U6eDZ0_JKAT5p3qoCCkmVf1It7fPn4vDNcTj4gKSGMXJA_UfzWpOeKLlnqg' alt='Trucks parked on Sunday at the closed Torkham border crossing between Afghanistan and Pakistan.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Conflicting tolls: The Taliban said its forces killed at least 58 Pakistani soldiers, while separate reporting cited at least 23 Pakistani soldiers and nine Afghan soldiers killed in the clashes [abcnews.go.com#1][ndtv.com#1][aljazeera.com#1].</li><li>Posts captured: Pakistan claimed it captured 19 Afghan border posts during the fighting along the frontier [aljazeera.com#1].</li><li>Trade halted: Pakistan closed crossings along the 2,600-km border, halting trade; trucks were parked at the closed Torkham crossing [straitstimes.com#1][nytimes.com#1].</li><li>Escalation risk: Isolated confrontations intensified over the past week into the sharpest escalation in years, raising fears of a wider conflict [nytimes.com#1].</li><li>Where fighting: Strikes were reported near the Durand Line, including around Behrampur district, according to early accounts [ndtv.com#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Afghan Taliban government: Said its forces launched retaliatory strikes after repeated violations of Afghan territory and airspace, claiming to have killed at least 58 Pakistani soldiers.
