Configuring systemd to redeploy my service when I commit a new source .jar file, I have a path file that goes along with the service and uses a PathChanged directive. The [Install] section should be in the path file, not the service file, but I notice this makes &ldquo;systemctl enable MYAPP&rdquo; impossible. It turns out that enable MYAPP assumes you mean MYAPP.service, so you actually just do systemctl enable MYAPP.path and you&rsquo;re set.
