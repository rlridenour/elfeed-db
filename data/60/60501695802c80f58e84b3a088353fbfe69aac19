<p>It&rsquo;s a nice Saturday morning here in NYC, with mostly clear skies. I&rsquo;m sipping my morning coffee. In about half an hour I&rsquo;ll head to the shower, put some clothes on (I need to get another pair of jeans, my single Levi is becoming my default out-and-about pants), and then take my 1.7 miles walk to the farmer&rsquo;s market to get some fresh vegetables for my sandwiches and hopefully some hearty soup.</p>
<p>This morning, still in bed, I was reading through my RSS feeds and enjoying myself. I&rsquo;ve picked up some new blogs which are currently &ldquo;on trial&rdquo; to see if I want to keep them. It&rsquo;s nice to finally have some new voices among the old favorites. I took some time updating my recommendations (AKA my <a href="https://taonaw.com/blogroll/">blogroll</a>) section with a few of those.</p>
<p>Looking at this short list, I&rsquo;m realizing I contacted almost all of them directly via email. I&rsquo;m starting to understand why some veteran bloggers rave about receiving emails: there&rsquo;s something very personal and honest about receiving an email from a person who usually writes for the whole world. At the same time, you get more insight into what made them write something you enjoy, and develop the conversation further. I highly recommend this. It would definitely make you feel better about emails, especially if emails are a big part of daily work and errands, which I suspect is true for all of us.</p>
<p>Alright, I&rsquo;ll leave you to it. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll find something you like. And good morning from NYC, or #tzag, as we see on the interbwebs these days.</p>
