<p>Marked Man (mm) is a little program I wrote to view Markdown files like UNIX man pages. (Because who wants to leave their terminal just to open a file?)</p>
<p>It uses <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> to convert between Markdown and the <code>groff</code> format. As a happy side-effect, this program can read basically <em>anything</em> as a man page: HTML, LaTeX, Word files (seriously), ePub, etc. Anything that Pandoc can read, Marked Man can handle.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on getting this set up with <a href="brew.sh">Homebrew</a>. For now, check out my GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/ashton314/homebrew-mm">here</a>.</p>
