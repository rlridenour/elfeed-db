<p>
I was wondering how to construct a multi-key map conditionally while I was coding in Clojure. Ideally, I would like to build it &#34;in one pass&#34; like <code class="verbatim">{:bar 2 (when true :baz 3)}</code>, but from what I had collected from Blue Sky, it seemed that&#39;s impossible, or it&#39;s just not an idiomatic way to program like that in Clojure. (Or, is this just a side effect of writing too much imperative code?)</p>
