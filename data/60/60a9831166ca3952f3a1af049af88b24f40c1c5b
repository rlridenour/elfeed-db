         
         <p>This package lets you preview a font inside of Emacs. It does so in
three ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prompt for a font on the system and display it in a buffer.</li>
  <li>List all known fonts in a buffer, with a short preview for each.</li>
  <li>Provide a major mode to preview a font whose file is among the
installed ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.0.0 on 2025-09-07</h2>

<p>This major update introduces support for fonts that cover more than
the Latin script. It also expands the available functionality with
quality-of-life refinements.</p>

<h3>Support for Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Japanese, Korean, Russian</h3>

<p>The commands <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-tabulated</code> (alias <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-list</code>) and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-select-preview</code> can now generate a preview for fonts that
are optimised to display the aforementioned languages. Each language
provides its own user option to control the sample text it displays.
The naming pattern <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-LANGUAGE-sample</code>.</p>

<p>Of those, I only know Greek and thus wrote the value of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-greek-sample</code>, namely: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Πρωτεσίλαος ο φιλόσοφος του οποίου
τα έργα βρίθουν αστειισμών"</code>. For the others I used translation
software to get the equivalent of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Protesilaos does not read
LANGUAGE"</code>. Please let me know if there are any mistakes in this
regard. I was thinking of writing something a bit more funny, but was
concerned the joke may not translate well.</p>

<h3>Checking for language support among known families</h3>

<p>While I have written functions that test if a given font can display a
range of characters, this approach is computationally intensive if we
need to check for many code points across multiple fonts.</p>

<p>The alternative is to maintain lists of known font families that are
meant to work with the given language. Those generally support Latin
as well, but the idea is to let them shine in the language they are
meant to be used for.</p>

<p>For example, here is how we know that a font family is meant to
display Arabic script:</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defconst</span> <span class="nv">show-font-arabic-families</span>
  <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"AlArabiya"</span> <span class="s">"AlBattar"</span> <span class="s">"AlHor"</span> <span class="s">"AlManzomah"</span> <span class="s">"AlYarmook"</span>
    <span class="s">"Dimnah"</span> <span class="s">"Hani"</span> <span class="s">"Haramain"</span> <span class="s">"Hor"</span> <span class="s">"Kayrawan"</span> <span class="s">"Khalid"</span> <span class="s">"Mashq"</span>
    <span class="s">"Nagham"</span> <span class="s">"Noto Kufi Arabic"</span> <span class="s">"Noto Naskh Arabic"</span> <span class="s">"Noto Sans Arabic"</span>
    <span class="s">"Rehan"</span> <span class="s">"Sharjah"</span> <span class="s">"Sindbad"</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="s">"List of families that specialise in Arabic.
Also see `show-font-greek-families' for the rationale of grouping font
families in distinct variables."</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The list is not exhaustive and I am always eager to expand it. Just
let me know.</p>

<p>I learnt about these font families through trial and error by (i)
installing them on my Debian system and (ii) searching online for
common samples of them. Do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt search -n fonts-</code> to check the
relevant packages.</p>

<h3>Support for music notation, mathematics, and other symbols</h3>

<p>As with the natural languages, there are some fonts that specialise in
displaying symbols. For example, MathJax has a bunch of fonts for
showing those fancy formulas in the processed output of LaTeX
documents. Again, there is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defconst</code> for each of those types of
font listing the known families. The concomitant user options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-mathematics-sample</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-music-sample</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-symbols-sample</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Problematic fonts are hidden from the list view</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-hidden-families</code> lists the fonts that are not known to
cause problems. They do not render properly any of the supported
samples and I am not sure even when they claim to support a certain
set of characters (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font--displays-latin-p</code> returns
non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>). If you think there is a mistake here, please contact me.</p>

<h3>Show a full preview from the list view</h3>

<p>While in the buffer produced by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-tabulated</code> (alias
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-list</code>), type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RET</code> to get a complete preview of the font
family of the current line. This is the same as invoking the command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-select-preview</code> and then selecting the given family.</p>

<p>The command called by that key binding is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-tabulated-select-preview</code>.
A hint of it is also shown in the tabulated list header.</p>

<h3>Quickly copy the name of the font in the list view</h3>

<p>As above, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w</code> in the tabulated view to copy the name of the font
family to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kill-ring</code>. The command is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font-tabulated-copy-name</code>
and there is also a hint of it in the tabulated list header.</p>
