Apple is continuing to improve the AI Support Assistant that it is testing in the Apple Support app, introducing new functionality in the latest update.<br/>

In addition to answering questions about Apple devices and services and providing device-specific help, Apple says the Support Assistant is able to help run diagnostics to show details about a device's health and performance.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Support app now has a more informative interface for the Support Assistant, and the tab for accessing the feature has an updated "Ask" label with a new icon instead of a "Chat" label. Apple is no longer calling the Support Assistant an "Early Preview," suggesting it is now available in a more official capacity.<br/>

Despite the update, the Support Assistant remains limited, and it is not yet available to all users. It's possible that Apple has expanded the feature to a larger number of testers, but not everyone will see it yet.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-support-assistant-early-preview/">began testing the Support Assistant</a> last August. The tool uses AI to answer questions related to Apple support, and it is able to walk users through step-by-step solutions for common problems.<br/>
<br/>
If the Support Assistant is unable to solve a problem, users are able to escalate a request to Apple's support staff for further help.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-support/">Apple Support</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/apple-support-assistant-update/">Apple Continues Improving Apple Support App&#039;s AI Assistant</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continues-improving-apple-support-apps-ai-assistant.2477116/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
