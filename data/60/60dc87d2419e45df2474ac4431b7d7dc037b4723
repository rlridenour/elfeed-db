<p>Rwanda has filed an arbitration case seeking about £100 million from the United Kingdom after London cancelled the countries’ Migration and Economic Development Partnership, which would have sent some asylum seekers who arrived in Britain to Rwanda. Kigali says it took legal action after what it calls UK “intransigence” on meeting financial and other commitments tied to the now-scrapped arrangement. The UK Home Office says it will contest the claim, keeping the dispute in the legal arena rather than in day-to-day diplomacy.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/3kEiTgnFZfUAFhqlRWVi0RuDdc8dYmld7AAeEX40LFxJyX7Lu5OAOMWSY9EURBIG2wRc41WgLFaHh8OdOkEW2Xv45fp9RDKkkp_3HeyuFKC71kQtKdhzvqUNkjOk8lg3stt3GdvRZWYWFG97iR2aPmx35aoziNkZ7y84F6viwfh-T8Wjn9Ase7sZASyU6-KwLAsWYFVjI1m0NW_h0CvxZJ2j2XE1vnFROlS7czp3gD2YbzGiwMqjcenCxm7nXA' alt='File photo used alongside coverage of Rwanda’s arbitration case over the cancelled UK asylum partnership.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Deal’s legal hurdle: The original arrangement faced repeated court challenges and culminated in a UK Supreme Court ruling in November 2023 that the plan was unlawful under international law, a decision that helped derail implementation.</li><li>UK policy shift: Rwanda says the partnership was agreed before Prime Minister Keir Starmer took office and that his government later scrapped the scheme in 2024.</li><li>Claims outlined: Rwanda says London failed to honor key financial and resettlement commitments under the MEDP and that arbitration became the only option after unsuccessful efforts to resolve the dispute.</li><li>UK response: Britain’s Home Office says it disputes Rwanda’s claim for additional payments and will fight the case.</li><li>Process chosen: Rwanda has opted for arbitration—typically a private, rules-based dispute process—rather than another round of domestic litigation, signaling both sides’ preference for a structured mechanism to settle the contract disagreement.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Rwanda: Rwanda says the UK’s “intransigence” left it with no choice but to pursue arbitration and that Britain did not meet key financial and resettlement commitments linked to the partnership.
