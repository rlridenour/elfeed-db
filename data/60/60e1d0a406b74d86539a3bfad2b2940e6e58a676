<p>Today Apple debuted a new&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/22/apple-vision-pro-motogp-tour-de-force-documentary/">MotoGP documentary</a>&nbsp;in Immersive Video and a&nbsp;<a href="https://tv.apple.com/show/wild-life/umc.cmc.63jzn7b2c5w488vb72cabapqa?itscg=30200&amp;itsct=tv_box_link&amp;mttnsubad=umc.cmc.63jzn7b2c5w488vb72cabapqa&amp;at=1000l3cvR">Wild Life</a>&nbsp;episode focused on orangutans.</p>

<p>With the exception of&nbsp;<a href="https://tv.apple.com/show/elevated/umc.cmc.5klf6wzriakqz7lcarzyp5bp1?itscg=30200&amp;itsct=tv_box_link&amp;mttnsubad=umc.cmc.5klf6wzriakqz7lcarzyp5bp1&amp;at=1000l3cvR">Elevated</a>, all of the forthcoming releases above come from third-party organizations.</p>



<p>That’s notable because in its young life so far, the Apple Immersive Video format has been slow to produce new content. But Apple has been working to give third parties the tool to create their own videos tailored for Vision Pro, and now those efforts are starting to pay off.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-previews-new-immersive-films-for-apple-vision-pro/">Apple says</a>: “These new films are among the first to be captured with Blackmagic Design’s URSA Cine Immersive camera and edited on Mac using DaVinci Resolve Studio.”</p>



<p>Blackmagic’s CEO offered the following quote:</p>



<p>“Apple Immersive Video is one of the most exciting storytelling formats we’ve ever seen, and we’re proud that Blackmagic tools are helping bring it to life,” said Grant Petty, Blackmagic Design’s CEO. “With the URSA Cine Immersive camera and DaVinci Resolve Studio, filmmakers can capture the world in incredible detail and realism, and then edit, grade, mix, and deliver their vision to audiences in exciting new ways. This really is the beginning of a whole new era for filmmaking.”</p>
