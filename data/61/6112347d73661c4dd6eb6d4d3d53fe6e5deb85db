<p>Iran’s army chief, Major General Amir Hatami, warned the United States and Israel against any attack and said Iran’s forces were on high alert as Washington expanded military deployments in the Persian Gulf region. He also said Iran’s nuclear know-how “cannot be eliminated,” framing it as expertise that would persist even if individuals were killed. The warnings come as President Trump has publicly said he expects Tehran to pursue a deal to avoid potential U.S. strikes, while Iranian officials signaled openness to nuclear talks but drew a firm line against negotiating missiles and defense capabilities. Alongside the rhetoric, Iranian authorities also moved to deny that several incidents reported on Saturday were connected to any attack or sabotage, underscoring how quickly regional nerves can spike during periods of military buildup.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/cEi_qFQePHo_mKlNRPVOu7mf-QwnZTFHevwEDPkphwiPOZq7MR9vh2FVTT7GxrE0d6FLqB9G7nhCMxk83Uryb6NfgAwRIU0qWtqthyfQNTFR' alt='Iranian army chief Major General Amir Hatami (file photo).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Carrier deployment: Washington’s buildup includes a naval strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, a move that has added to fears of direct confrontation.</li><li>Retaliation warning: Iran has said it would respond to an attack with missile strikes on U.S. bases, ships and allies, including Israel, according to reporting that summarized official warnings.</li><li>Post-war context: Hatami’s comments follow a June episode in which the U.S. struck key Iranian nuclear sites during a brief period when it joined Israel’s 12-day war with Iran.</li><li>Limits on talks: Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran was ready for nuclear talks, but that missiles and defense “will never be negotiated,” outlining Iran’s bargaining boundaries.</li><li>Incidents denied: Iranian authorities denied that multiple Saturday incidents were linked to attack or sabotage, as the cause of at least one reported blast remained unclear.</li></ul><blockquote>If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region, and the security of the Zionist regime (Israel), - Amir Hatami</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iranian military leadership: Iran says it is at full defensive readiness and warns the U.S. and Israel that any attack would trigger a response, while insisting Iranian nuclear expertise cannot be erased.
