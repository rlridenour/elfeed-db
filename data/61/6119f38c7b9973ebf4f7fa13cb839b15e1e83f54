The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE 3</a> is designed to be a low-cost option that still offers many of the Apple Watch features that have made the device so popular over the years, while the Apple Watch Series 11 offers a more feature-rich experience with additional health monitoring capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
With the latest generation, the Apple Watch SE has a lot more in common with Apple's higher end watches, offering an always-on display, body temperature sensing, sleep apnea detection, 5G connectivity on cellular models, media playback, 64GB of storage, and the S10 chip.<br/>
<br/>
There are still some significant differences between the two devices. Our comparison helps to answer the question of which of these two Apple Watch models is best for you.<br/>

The Apple Watch Series 11 is minor improvement over the previous Series 10 model, offering 5G connectivity on cellular models, a slightly bigger battery, and stronger glass on aluminum models. Yet compared to the Apple Watch SE, the Apple Watch Series 11 is a considerably more feature-rich device with advanced capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
With its larger display, additional health monitoring features, and range of colors and finishes, the Apple Watch Series 11 will be the model of choice for those who want more out of their smartwatch. If you feel that the added health monitoring features (such as ECG and blood oxygen monitoring) or more advanced display would be particularly useful to you, or simply like a specific casing and color combination that is not available with the Apple Watch SE, the Apple Watch Series 11 will be the best model for you. <br/>
<br/>
If you are on a budget and are not particularly attracted to the additional features of the Series 11, the Apple Watch SE is a highly compelling option. It now features an always-on display, fast charging, and several new health features such as sleep apnea detection and body temperature sensing, and there are surprisingly few drawbacks. Both devices have the S10 chip and 64GB of storage, and are equally future-proof.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest flaw of the &zwnj;Apple Watch SE 3&zwnj; is its design, which is based on the Apple Watch Series 4 from 2018 and is now quite outdated. Nevertheless, as it shares many key features with the Apple Watch Series 11, many customers will be happy choosing the more inexpensive model, unless you particularly value features such as the larger display or advanced health monitoring and can justify the added cost. <br/>

The Apple Watch SE is an ideal device for kids and senior citizens who do not have an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; thanks to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/family-setup/">Family Setup</a>, but it is also the go-to model for most customers who are new to the Apple Watch and those who are upgrading from an Apple Watch Series 4, SE 1, or older due to its competitive pricing and generous feature set, allowing users to get a balanced Apple Watch experience at a low price.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 11</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE 3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-se-3-vs-series-11/">Apple Watch SE 3 vs. Series 11 Buyers Guide: 30+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-se-3-vs-series-11-buyers-guide-30-differences-compared.2467077/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
