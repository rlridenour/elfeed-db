Emacs that provide colourful (“pretty”) yet legible options for users
who want something with a bit more flair than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code> (also
designed by me).</p>

<h2>Version 1.9.0 on 2024-11-16</h2>

<p>This version introduces several small refinements to an already
comprehensive basis.</p>

<h3>No interference with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-modern</code></h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-modern</code> package is not meant to be touched by a theme. This
is what I am doing with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code>, but I forgot to remove the
changes made by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Daniel Mendler, author of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-modern</code>, for bringing this
matter to my attention. This was done in issue 48:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/48">https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/48</a>.</p>

<h3>Colour refinements for several themes</h3>

<p>I document those, though most of them will not be noticeable, unless
on a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-day</code> palette value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">green-warmer</code> has a marginally
greater contribution from the red channel of light, making it a tiny
bit “warmer”. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">green-faint</code> is made less warm. In context, these
tweaks make certain elements easier to tell apart, while retaining
the character of the theme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-reverie</code> value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blue-faint</code> is less saturated, so its
blue impression is diminished. It still performs its role in all the
relevant contexts, only now it does it better by not competing with
other shades of blue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-light</code> value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-dim</code> is much less intense, though still
within the desired contrast range. This way, it works better in
context. The “added” background colours (used in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff-mode</code>, Ediff,
Magit, etc.) are a little bit more intense to be more harmonious
with other elements in a diff output. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blue-faint</code> has lower
contribution from the blue channel of light in the interest of not
interfering with other blue hues, while still looking alright
itself. The semantic palette mapping for links now uses the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blue-warmer</code> colour instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blue</code>, as the former is less
ambiguous in context. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-alt</code> is recalibrated to be closer to a
grey value, improving its use in several places. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red-cooler</code>
value is redone to not be conflated with magenta: it now delivers a
rosy red impression. Lastly, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rainbow-2</code> mapping uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">magenta</code>
instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">magenta-warmer</code> for consistency in all relevant
situations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-night</code> semantic colour mapping of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preprocessor</code> is toned
down in intensity to remove what was a stylistic exaggeration. The
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">variable</code> mapping is tweaked to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cyan-warmer</code> instead of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cyan</code> colour, as the former is slightly more suited to the role due
to how it combines with other colours. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> semantic mapping
is bound to a less intense shade of magenta, making it not overpower
other constructs in a competition for attention. Finally, the value
of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">magenta-faint</code> colour has a greater contribution from the
blue channel of light to shift its hue slightly closer to purple.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-deuteranopia-light</code> palette entry for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red-faint</code> is more
yellow to be discernible where needed. Similarly, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cyan-cooler</code>
has a reduced contribution from the red channel of light.</p>

    <p>[ Note that the “deuteranopia” and “tritanopia” themes define all
  colours in the palette to be consistent with the overall project,
  but only use hues that are appropriate for red-green and blue-yellow
  colour deficiency, respectively. ]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “subtle” backgrounds of all themes (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-red-subtle</code>) are
redone to feel more natural in the context of their respective
theme. Before, some values were a bit exaggerated and/or not aligned
with the overall aesthetic. Still, the changes are small: do not
expect your preferred theme to be refashioned.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>More accurate faces for Org agenda dates</h3>

<p>The faces used by Org agenda to style events with a scheduled date or
deadline are redesigned to better complement the semantics of what is
on display. Pressing tasks stand out more, while those that do not
require immediate attention are rendered in a more subtle style.</p>

<p>Thanks to Adam Porter (aka GitHub alphapapa) for suggesting this
revision and discussing the technicalities with me. This was done in
issue 102 of the Modus themes repository (but the principles apply to
the Ef themes as well): <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/102">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/102</a>.</p>

<h3>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forge</code> package is fully supported</h3>

<p>All of its faces will now look consistent in context as they get the
appropriate colours of the active Ef theme.</p>

<p>Thanks to Len Trigg for reporting that some attributes were not
suitable for the intended purpose of certain Forge faces. I fixed
those accordingly. This was done in issue 47:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/47">https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/issues/47</a>.</p>

<h3>Support for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tldr</code> package</h3>

<p>This makes it look consistent with the rest of the theme.</p>

<h3>Support for the built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">window-tool-bar-mode</code></h3>

<p>This is a mode available in Emacs 30. Its faces will look right at all
times.</p>

<h3>Support for the built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hexl-mode</code></h3>

<p>Instead of using shades of grey backgrounds, the themes use carefully
chosen foreground values that are easier to spot.</p>

<h3>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">embark</code> faces are brought up-to-date</h3>

<p>Old symbols are removed and the current ones are added in their stead.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:background-mode</code> property of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-melissa-dark</code> theme is
set to the correct symbol. Thanks to Pedro Cunha for making the
change in pull request 46: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/pull/46">https://github.com/protesilaos/ef-themes/pull/46</a>.
The change is small, so Pedro does not need to assign copyright to
the Free Software Foundation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graphical buttons inherit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-button</code> face, which makes
it easier to ensure theme-wide consistency for all relevant faces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all-the-icons</code> faces for Ibuffer use different colours that
refine how everything looks in context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The popup produced by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">corfu</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">company</code> packages will use a
monospaced font (inherit from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixed-pitch</code>) if the user option
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-mixed-fonts</code> is set to a non-nil value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The annotation function used by the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes-select</code> or
related now uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">completions-annotations</code> face, as it should.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
