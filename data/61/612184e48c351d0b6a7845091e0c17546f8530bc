The first reviews of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-announces-iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max</a> have now been published by selected media outlets and YouTube channels, offering a closer look at the device ahead of Friday's launch.<br/>

The iPhone 17 Pro models feature one of the biggest design changes to the device in years, moving to an aluminum unibody frame and a full-width rear camera plateau. New color options include Silver, Deep Blue, and Cosmic Orange. <br/>
<br/>
A completely new front-facing camera features an 18-megapixel square sensor, facilitating automatic rotation and Center Stage. There is also a 48-megapixel telephoto camera for the first time, enabling 4x and 8x optical zoom. <br/>
<br/>
The A19 Pro chip enables better performance with Neural Accelerators. A vapor chamber cooling system is built-in for even better heat dissipation.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include noticeably longer battery life, an improved anti-reflective coating, Ceramic Shield 2, a brighter display, Genlock support, and more. <br/>
<br/>
The two key advantages the Pro models have over the ultra-thin iPhone Air include roughly 20% to 40% longer battery life, and a Telephoto rear camera with 4x and 8x optical zoom. The devices also have an Ultra Wide camera, if you use it.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max can be pre-ordered now. Below, we have rounded up some of the reviews.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/apple-iphone-17-pro-review#section-apple-iphone-17-pro-review-battery-life-and-charging"><em>Tom's Guide</em></a> on the iPhone 17 Pro's battery life:<blockquote>This results in a longer battery life for the iPhone 17 Pro according to our battery drain test, reaching a time of 15 hours and 32 minutes. That's a marked improvement over the iPhone 16 Pro’s average run of 14 hours and 7 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also seeing solid all-day battery life with my real world use. Most of my time on the phone has been spent surfing the web, taking tons of photos with all its cameras, watching videos on YouTube, and getting in a few sessions with Diablo Immortal and Age of Origins throughout my day. I've made a point to not top off its battery during the day, only to find it at about 20% battery life by the end of the night.</blockquote><em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/i-tested-the-iphone-17-pro-max-and-its-part-midlife-crisis-and-part-battery-life-king/">CNET</a></em> took a closer look at the new Telephoto camera:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>I thought I'd notice the difference between 4x and 5x, but unless I had the phones side-by-side, I was unaware. The 17 Pro Max's telephoto images are brighter and have better details and resolution than ones from the 16 Pro, which is likely the result of the larger sensor.<br/>
<br/>
And similar to the wizardry Apple uses to make 2x photos look good, the telephoto camera is able to achieve 8x images. Telephoto images at 4x taken under good lighting (like a nice sunny day) can stand toe-to-toe with images from the main camera. But when I took telephoto images in less than ideal lighting, the 4x images held up OK, whereas the 8x images had more noise and softness.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.wired.com/review/apple-iphone-17-pro-and-iphone-17-pro-max/"><em>WIRED</em></a> praised the improved thermals:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>I played one of the most demanding games on the iPhone right now—Assassin's Creed Mirage—and performance was significantly smoother than when I played it on the iPhone 16 Pro last year. The iPhone 17 Pro still got hot, but the heat was spread out over the entire back of the phone, so it didn't feel as uncomfortable to hold while gaming (unlike the iPhone 17 and Air). I maxed out the graphical settings, and the frames per second were noticeably more stable, and I rarely saw stutters at all.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-and-pro-max-review-an-impactful-redesign-120002202.html"><em>Engadget</em></a> said the A19 Pro's Neural Accelerators make a meaningful difference to AI tasks:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>I do want to commend Apple for the improved performance in Image Playground and Genmoji. It used to take ages for AI-generated pictures or emoji to appear (especially those based on a picture of someone in my photo album), but on the iPhone 17 Pro I was able to get several options in succession before things slowed down. Pictures where I opted to use ChatGPT’s more realistic styles took a lot longer, but by and large I saw a marked improvement in speed here. Those neural accelerators in the A19 Pro’s six-core GPU are certainly pulling their weight.</blockquote><br/>
