<blockquote>
  <p>X’s decision to show where accounts are based is, theoretically, a
positive step in the direction of transparency for the platform,
which has let troll and spam accounts proliferate since Musk’s
purchase, in late 2022. And yet the scale of the deception — as
revealed by the “About” feature — suggests that in his haste to
turn X into a political weapon for the far right, Musk may have
revealed that the platform he’s long <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1873928098087117137">called</a> “the number 1
source of news on Earth” is really just a worthless, poisoned hall
of mirrors.</p>

  <p>If I’m understanding this correctly, X is owned by a white
nationalist who pays poor people of color in developing countries
to pretend to be working class white Americans to scare other
white Americans into being afraid poor people of color from
developing countries are going to ruin America?</p>
