 
          <p>Those of you who know me also know that I love writing with a <a href="/tags/fountain-pens">fountain pen</a>. My late father-in-law had been pushing me for years to buy a small lathe and try my hand at some simple shapes&mdash;including a fountain pen barrel, of course. Being quite the capable woodworking autodidact, he taught me how to construct a few rudimentary things. Together, we created my stone oven cabinet on wheels I still use on a weekly basis. To this day, I regret not buying a lathe to create more things together.</p>
<p>The idea of following a woodworking workshop or a pen creation workshop stuck on the back of my mind but never quite managed to materialize. In <a href="/post/2024/06/may-2024">May 2024</a>, when I visited the Dutch Pen Show, a few artisans that presented their home-made pens there also offered workshops but lived more than <code>500 km</code> away in the northern part of Germany, being out of reach for a quick &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go there and do that&rdquo; excursion.</p>
<p>Until last month, when my wife somehow found out about Eddy Nijsen&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.woodblanksandpenkits.nl/">Wood Blanks &amp; Penkits</a> company and neglected to tell me. Instead, she organized a secret birthday present, invited two more friends over to accompany me, and booked a &ldquo;mystery event&rdquo; in the calendar. That morning, when I heard one of my friend&rsquo;s voices coming to pick me up, I expected us to go to some kind of board game convention. An hour later, we pulled over in a rather anonymous looking street in Weert, The Netherlands, and I had no clue what we were doing there.</p>
<p>Boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise! We spent the entire day doing this:</p>

<p>It was quite possibly the best day I&rsquo;ve had in months. The hours flew by and at the end of the day we all made two pens: one regular ball pen with a typical Parker filling that twists to open, and one fountain pen. Both pens turned out to be remarkable for different reasons.</p>
<p>The ball pen is not one I will be using regularly but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it wasn&rsquo;t worth creating it. The wooden blank we used for this pen is unique to say the least. The black splintery wood almost smelled and felt like charcoal. Eddy, our instructor, managed to salvage it during a local archaeological dig that excavated a medieval oak water well shaft. Experts estimate that the ancient oak was felled in around 1250.</p>
<p>Decades of exposure to ground water penetrating the oak cells permanently deformed and coloured the wood. After years of drying in Eddy&rsquo;s workspace, it was sawn into smaller rectangular blocks called &ldquo;pen blanks&rdquo; where we proceeded to drill a hole in, attach to the lathe, and rework into a cylindrical shape that can be pressed onto other components called a &ldquo;pen kit&rdquo;. The metal components we worked with that day were high quality <a href="https://www.beaufortink.co.uk/pen-kits">Beaufort Ink pen kits</a>. After sanding, multiple waxing steps, the involvement of glue and a dedicated pen press, it was ready to write with!</p>
<p>The pen has a mechanical twist mechanism on top that&rsquo;s part of the kit. Therefore, we only needed to finish one pen blank. For the fountain pen that has a screw cap, we&rsquo;d need to up our game, as not only we have to work two barrels, but the dimensions and particular shapes differ: the pen is thinner on the bottom and thicker near the grip.</p>

<p>For the fountain pen, we could choose whatever wood we wanted. My friends chose different kinds of bright looking exotic wood while I went for the dark brown-grey walnut. My parents had multiple walnut trees when we were kids and I loved climbing in them and helping with the harvest. Selecting a type of wood closer to home seemed like the obvious choice for me.</p>
<p>I carefully recorded all specific steps we took that day&mdash;with the home-made pen, of course&mdash;in case I accidentally buy a lathe and want to get in some more exercise. It felt amazing to work with my hands instead of staring at a screen all day long. Eddy&rsquo;s mastery over his woodworking felt magical. He said that there&rsquo;s only one way to achieve this: practice, fail, practice, fail, practice, fail some more. I doubt I&rsquo;ll be able to finish one pen on my own without his guidance. I wish my father-in-law was still alive.</p>
<p>It gradually dawned to me that I wasn&rsquo;t really making a fountain pen. I was just creating a beautiful hull. Woodworking is not enough: you also need to be an expert jeweller to craft a great nib that writes like a dream. The stock nib that came with the Beaufort Ink pen kit unfortunately didn&rsquo;t: it felt scratchy and dry. I anticipated this and have since replaced it with a fine platinum Bock nib that writes great although I&rsquo;m still struggling with the ink flow going from the converter to the feed.</p>
<p>The platinum nib was expensive (<code>€65</code> excluding shipping) but it would be a shame never to use the pen. While the Beaufort Ink material indeed is of very high quality, this particular pen kit model is not the most well-balanced: posting the cap is entirely useless as it&rsquo;s much too heavy. Also, the metal grip is much thinner than the wooden body that we created. Compared to a Lamy 2000 or a kit-less pen, searching for the right grip and writing takes a while to get used to.</p>
<p>But who cares, I made my own fountain pen! The second mod I&rsquo;m planning to do is to laser the Brain Baking logo on top of the cap. I love the way the pen and walnut wood feels and the subtle colour differences that neatly line up when you screw on the cap again is beautiful (but difficult to catch on camera).</p>
<p>I do wonder what else you can do with a lathe if you do not limit yourself to just using a pen kit&hellip;</p>
