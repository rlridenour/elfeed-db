Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-unveils-m5-chip-with-next-generation-gpu/">announced the M5 chip</a>, featuring improved performance and efficiency with up to a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. Apple says the M5 chip offers up to 15% faster CPU performance and up to 45% faster graphics, compared to the M4.<br/>
<br/>
It also contains a next-generation GPU architecture optimized for AI tasks, Neural Accelerators for each core, a third-generation ray-tracing engine, enhanced shader cores, and second-generation dynamic caching. There is also a faster 16-core Neural Engine. It has memory bandwidth of 153GB/s and supports up to 32GB of unified memory.<br/>
<br/>
The M5 chip comes to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-macbook-pro-with-m5-chip/">entry-level MacBook Pro</a>, delivering improved performance. It can also now be configured with up to 4TB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-debuts-new-ipad-pro-with-m5/">also gains the M5 chip</a>, along with Apple's N1 chip, a new custom-designed wireless networking chip that provides Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Cellular versions of the new ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ feature Apple's C1X modem, which allows up to 50% faster cellular data performance than its predecessor, with much greater efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
The new ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ adds the ability to drive external displays at up to 120Hz and now supports Adaptive Sync. The 256GB and 512GB models now start with 12GB of unified memory.<br/>
<br/>
The M5 chip is also a key part of a notable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">update to the Vision Pro</a>. The headset now renders 10% more pixels, can ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate, and offers three hours of battery life.<br/>
<br/>
A new Dual Knit Band features two straps knitted into a single piece, providing a more comfortable fit. The lower strap has tungsten inserts that provide a counterweight. Apple is also now selling the Logitech Muse spatial stylus for the Vision Pro, and it will begin selling the PlayStation VR2 Sense controller starting next month.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's new devices are now available to pre-order, with launch on Wednesday, October 22. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.<br/>
