In addition, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro can now be configured with up to 4TB of storage on Apple's online store, whereas the previous model maxed out at 2TB. However, the maximum amount of unified RAM available for this model remains 32GB.<br/>
<br/>
Like the M4 chip, Apple's next-generation M5 chip has a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, but it is faster. Apple says the M5 chip offers up to 15% faster CPU performance, and up to 45% faster graphics, compared to the M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
An enhanced 10-core GPU has a Neural Accelerator in each core, enabling more than 4× the peak GPU compute performance compared to the M4 chip, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Memory bandwidth has increased from 120GB/s to 153GB/s. <br/>
<br/>
There are no major design changes, with the base 14-inch MacBook Pro still having a Liquid Retina XDR display with up to 1,000 nits (SDR) and up to 1,600 nits (HDR) of brightness, three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, a headphone jack, a MagSafe 3 magnetic charging port, and a backlit Magic Keyboard with Touch ID.<br/>

<br/>
