<p>In 1931, 5-year-old Mel Brooks saw <em>Frankenstein</em> and refused open his window on a summer night. His mother talked to him:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Let&#8217;s say you are right. That Frankenstein wants to come here and kill you and eat you. But let&#8217;s look at all the trouble he&#8217;s going to have to get to Brooklyn. First of all, he lives in Transylvania. That&#8217;s somewhere in Romania. That&#8217;s in Europe. And that&#8217;s a long, long ways away. So even if he decides to come here, he has to get a bus or a train or hitchhike to somewhere he can get a boat to go to America. Believe me, nobody is going to pick him up. So let&#8217;s say he&#8217;s lucky enough to find a boat that would take him here. Okay, so he is here in New York City, but he really doesn&#8217;t know how the subways work. When he asks people they just run away! Finally, let&#8217;s say he figures out it&#8217;s not the IRT, it&#8217;s the BMT and he gets to Brooklyn. Then he&#8217;s got to figure out how to get to 365 South Third Street. Okay, it&#8217;s going to be a long walk. So let&#8217;s say he finally gets to Williamsburg and he finally finds our tenement. But remember, all the windows at 365 are going to be wide open and he&#8217;s had a long journey, so he must be very hungry. So if he has to kill and eat somebody, he probably would go through the first-floor window and eat all the Rothsteins who are living in apartment 1A. And once he&#8217;s full, there is no reason for him to go all the way up to the fifth floor and eat you.

<p>&#8220;The story made good sense to me. &#8216;Okay,&#8217; I said, &#8216;open the window. I&#8217;ll take a chance.'&#8221;</p>
