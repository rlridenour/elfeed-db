<p>Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have entered and taken control of Uvira, a strategic lakeside town in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo near the border with Burundi, in the largest escalation in months of the conflict in the Kivu region. Uvira has served as the seat of the Kinshasa-appointed administration in South Kivu and a major military base since the provincial capital Bukavu fell to M23 earlier this year, meaning the group now effectively dominates both North and South Kivu along key trade and transport routes on Lake Tanganyika. The advance came even as Congolese, Rwandan and US officials met in Washington to sign what was presented as a peace accord, raising questions over the viability of that deal and the extent of control the parties have over fighters on the ground. Burundi responded by closing its nearby border crossing, while diplomats and regional governments now face renewed pressure to prevent further civilian displacement and to salvage a political process capable of curbing violence in eastern Congo.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/hY6dV5seDV-uXaWH4xN6MIsK_z7-LKuEwEw4f2ZLGDczEGYztxymR70BDVYvPE8vTT2v8kMhtYJtAu-0V5UqTkbbKtca4Wrrq6IbRIfz-eTizGBENd5YorBIKWh-4WTj923hQelm7r8XovlIlQrkKqO0_pWLZRSDQs_kNI88M4-X3HEFvGu2AIppAEc' alt='M23’s capture of Uvira extends its control across much of North and South Kivu in eastern Congo.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Strategic location: Uvira lies on the shores of Lake Tanganyika and controls an important lakeside port that connects eastern Congo to regional trade routes toward Burundi and beyond, making it a prized objective for both government forces and M23.</li><li>Shift in provincial power: After M23 captured Bukavu, Uvira had functioned as the administrative and military hub for South Kivu’s Kinshasa-appointed authorities, so its loss further weakens central government presence in the province.</li><li>Border closure: Burundi shut its frontier with Congo near Uvira following the rebel entry, a move that disrupts legal cross-border trade and travel but is intended to limit spillover of fighting.</li><li>Washington peace effort: The rebel advance coincided with the signing of a US-brokered accord in Washington that officials had framed as a step toward ending hostilities, underscoring the gap between diplomatic announcements and realities on the ground.</li><li>Regional escalation risk: Control of Uvira could allow M23 to push along the lakeshore and inland corridors, raising fears among neighbors that the conflict might edge closer to their borders if not contained.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Democratic Republic of Congo government: Kinshasa-appointed authorities had used Uvira as their South Kivu seat and military base after the fall of Bukavu, so its capture represents a major setback to their efforts to maintain state authority in the province.
