<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>I am on macOS all day everyday. I like the OS, my job revolves around Apple products and the quality control of the hardware and software is off the charts.</p>
<p>Plus with macOS it is easier for me to run the other 2 of the big three OS on the same machine. You don&rsquo;t believe me? Try and run a macOS VM on Windows or Linux.</p>
<p>Still I am a big fan of open-source software. So much so, that most of my favorite tools on my MacBook are open-source. And I want to share some of them with the intention of maybe helping someone out there.</p>
<p>Granted, not all the tools that will be presented here are free and open-source, but they will make out a huge chunck of the series. You will see!</p>
<p>I have been wanting to make this series to throw my hat in the ring of opinions, but I barely had the time for it. Now listing the first bunch I hope to put myself under pressure to finally go for it.</p>
<h2 id="what">What</h2>
<p>The first list of apps and tools I want to talk about in the following weeks:</p>
<h3 id="emacs"><a href="https://macowners.club/posts/favorite-apps-tools-2/">Emacs</a></h3>
<img style="display:inline;float:left;margin:10px 0px;" src="https://macowners.club/images/emacs.png" width="75"/>
<p>By far my favorite application, ney universal tool, is Emacs. I spend quite a lot of time of my day at work and at home in Emacs. Email, RSS, writing, reading, scripting, DTG and much more.</p>
<p>Even this post is being written for hugo inside Emacs&rsquo;s org-mode. Which by itself might merit a post in the future. You know what, I take back the &ldquo;might&rdquo;, this is a definite &ldquo;does&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="vim"><a href="https://macowners.club/posts/favorite-apps-tools-3/">Vim</a></h3>
<img style="display:inline;float:left;margin:10px 0px;" src="https://macowners.club/images/vim.png" width="75"/>
<p>Nothing beats Vim&rsquo;s modal text editing power (I use Evil in Emacs as well, ssshhh!). One can fly around thousend of lines of code/text in a giffy. I am not even at 40% of what Vim can do, but I imagine myself to be way way faster than I was around 1,5 years ago before I got &ldquo;baptized&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="fzf"><a href="https://macowners.club/posts/favorite-apps-tools-4/">Fzf</a></h3>
<img style="display:inline;float:left;margin:10px 0px;" src="https://macowners.club/images/fzf.png" width="75"/>
<p>This is a great tool for the cli. It does one thing and one thing only. But it does it brilliantly. It takes a list as input and lets you fuzzy search/match the lines in the list and spits out the selection(s) to the stdout.</p>
<p>Just imagine the possibilities. More about it in the post to come.</p>
<h3 id="hammerspoon"><a href="https://macowners.club/posts/favorite-apps-tools-5/">Hammerspoon</a></h3>
<img style="display:inline;float:left;margin:10px 0px;" src="https://macowners.club/images/hammerspoon.png" width="75"/>
<p>Hammerspoon is another fantastic application, that extends your mac functionality mostly through the incredible automation chops.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keybindings</li>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>Window Management</li>
<li>Run arbitrary scripts too</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alfred"><a href="https://macowners.club/posts/favorite-apps-tools-6/">Alfred</a></h3>
<img style="display:inline;float:left;margin:10px 0px;" src="https://macowners.club/images/alfred.png" width="75"/>
<p>On the surface one might think that Alfred.app is just a replacement for the macOS built in Spotlight. But it is much more. It is an App launcher, search tool, bookmark, snippets &amp; clipboard manager etc.</p>
<p>When you add the workflow capabilities to it though, sky is the limit.</p>
<h3 id="affinity-suite"><a href="https://macowners.club/posts/favorite-apps-tools-7/">Affinity Suite</a></h3>
<img style="display:inline;float:left;margin:10px 0px;" src="https://macowners.club/images/affinity.png" width="75"/>
<p>This is a worthy and professional grade set of Application (Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer, Affinity Publisher) to replace the Adobe Creative Cloud Design suite. Enough said.</p>
<h3 id="docker"><a href="https://macowners.club/posts/favorite-apps-tools-8/">Docker</a></h3>
<img style="display:inline;float:left;margin:10px 0px;" src="https://macowners.club/images/docker.png" width="75"/>
<p>Well, Docker let&rsquo;s you run almost all (Dev) Tools under the sky, mostly Linux based, in container environments.</p>
<p>I even run Linux X11-based GUI Applications with the help of the XQuartz project on my mac. Whaaat?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Of course this is just a subset of the stuff I want to talk about in this series. But I will have to get started first, right.</p>
