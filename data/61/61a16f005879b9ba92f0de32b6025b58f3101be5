<p>A little over a week ago, I <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-time-zones-mode">introduced time-zones</a>, an Emacs utility to easily check city times around the world. Today, I'm happy to report, the package <a href="https://melpa.org/#/time-zones">has been accepted into MELPA</a>.</p>

<p>It's been wonderful to see how well time-zones was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1oarhkl/a_new_world_clock_package/">received on Reddit</a>.</p>

<h2>Will you make the work sustainable?</h2>
<p>Bringing features and improving our beloved text editor takes time and effort. <code>time-zones</code> isn't my first package, I've also published a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium">bunch of Emacs packages</a>. Will you help make this work <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium">sustainable</a>?</p>
