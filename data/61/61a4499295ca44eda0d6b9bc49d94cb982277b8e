<p>Apple on Thursday <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=awedznci">announced major changes to its EU app policies</a>. Here’s the gist:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tiered App Store fees.</strong> For today’s full-service App Store, developers will now pay 13% on sales, reduced to 10% for Small Business Program members. Or developers can opt into “Tier One”, which comes with a 5% fee but does not support a raft of App Store features we’ve come to expect, like automatic app updates, App Store promotions, placement in search suggestions, ratings and reviews on product listings(!), and more.
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Core Technology Commission.</strong> Apple is going to move all developers over to a new tax called the Core Technology Commission, in which developers who opt to sell apps outside the App Store will pay 5% of sales made through in-app promotions. The €0.50-per-install Core Technology Fee will be dropped as of January 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free linking.</strong> Developers can promote offers broadly, are no longer limited to a single static URL without tracking parameters, and can freely design the interfaces for those links and promotions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New business terms.</strong> Developers have to pay a 2% fee for digital goods and services purchased by new users for the first six months after a user first downloads an app; members of the Small Business Program don’t have to pay this fee.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/26/apple-announces-sweeping-app-store-changes-in-the-eu/">gave a statement to Chance Miller of 9to5Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store. We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple always disagrees and always appeals, but these are pretty big changes. The introduction of a lower App Store tier with lower fees (but more spite?), combined with the reduced rates to the regular App Store fee structure, is especially fascinating. One has to wonder if Apple would’ve had as much trouble in the EU if it had made changes like this much sooner, but here we are.</p>
