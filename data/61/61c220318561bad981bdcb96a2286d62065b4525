    When starting a long process, I prefix a shell command with <a href="beep.sh">beep</a>, a shell script I wrote to alert when the process had completed. I've been wanting to have a version for Emacs, and thought that I would also demonstrate how easy it is to add a feature to Emacs.

    <b>Updated:</b> Enhanced the function to only "beep" when a command when too long, which means I can attach the beep to just about any function without getting annoyed if the function immediately returned.
