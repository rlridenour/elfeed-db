<p>Just met this nice article by Laurie Voss called <code>You suck at technical interviews</code>.</p>
<p>Here is TL;DR from there:</p>
<ul>
<li>many interview techniques test skills that are at best irrelevant to real working life</li>
<li>you want somebody who knows enough to do the job right now</li>
<li>or somebody smart and motivated enough that they can learn the job quickly</li>
<li>you want somebody who keeps getting better at what they do</li>
<li>your interview should be a collaborative conversation, not a combative interrogation</li>
<li>you also want somebody who you will enjoy working with</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s important to separate &ldquo;enjoy working with&rdquo; from &ldquo;enjoy hanging out with&rdquo;</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t hire assholes, no matter how good they are</li>
<li>if your team isn&rsquo;t diverse, your team is worse than it needed to be</li>
<li>accept that hiring takes a really long time and is really, really hard</li>
</ul>
