<p>The White House has named members of a new Gaza “Board of Peace,” an executive body that President Trump will chair as part of his plan for a transitional period of governance and reconstruction in the Palestinian territory. The announced members include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, World Bank Group President Ajay Banga, and Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan. The announcement comes as Gaza continues to experience deadly violence despite a ceasefire that took effect in October, with the administration framing the board as a vehicle to coordinate rebuilding and governance arrangements.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/I_ftrTXoWLSdIHToDkmHsjQ0JzALRZ3Z6cSNToHKPJRyrmHr8uTTqXPKtCy4NlVWlFhTbNmnZHRdzf2QDgq3MP5MsqZh6spgsNqaF3SlayCkusIPTBrjsJUDKxRGm0wUEPwjCFNhmedqf2fY3eAjHBWVg5XTCJoANLAUqEcGJG4lhpaPbuHBT4Ix-WzLgBmjvIHxXfjWVFC28Ng_BmyhFjNi67fN4idKBtwii1DHqIacjS2dMSHHFoLoZRPZXcLQ9_-k5sWBPLfTBSmluA' alt='Palestinians inspect rubble in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, Jan. 16, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Board remit: The White House said the board’s work will span governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilization.</li><li>Palestinian committee: A separate Palestinian-led body, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, held its first meeting in Cairo, with its leader Ali Sha’ath saying he wants to move quickly on immediate needs such as shelter and estimating reconstruction and recovery could take about three years.</li><li>Further appointments: The White House said additional board members will be announced in the coming weeks, indicating the structure may expand beyond the initial seven.</li><li>Mixed reception: Al Jazeera reported expectations of widespread condemnation tied to Blair’s and Kushner’s past roles in Middle East policy debates, underscoring that the roster is likely to face strong scrutiny from parts of the region and beyond.</li></ul><blockquote>Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House: The administration presents the “Board of Peace,” chaired by President Trump, as the executive mechanism to supervise transitional governance and drive reconstruction, investment, and funding coordination for Gaza.
