Google is expected to unveil its latest Pixel 10 smartphones during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/google-pixel-10-august-20/">August 20 event</a>, and it appears the devices will feature MagSafe-like charging without a case.<br/>

As spotted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715747/google-pixel-10-leak-qi2-pixelsnap-magnetic-wireless-charging">by <em>The Verge</em></a>, reputable leaker Evan Blass (@evleaks) this week <a href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1950291436173226325">shared</a> an alleged Pixel 10 marketing image that shows what appears to be a magnetic wireless charger affixed directly to the back of the device. In fact, the Pixel charger looks nearly identical to Apple's MagSafe Charger for iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
This rumor makes sense, as Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/03/qi2-wireless-charging-standard-gains-magsafe/">contributed its MagSafe design to the Qi2 spec</a> a few years ago, and the Pixel 10 is expected to support Qi2.<br/>
<br/>
Blass has a proven track record with leaks — mostly for Android devices, but occasionally for Apple devices too. In 2020, for example, he shared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/13/iphone-12-pro-colors-leaked/">iPhone 12</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/13/homepod-mini-leaked/">HomePod mini images</a> a few hours before Apple announced those devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced MagSafe on iPhone 12 models in 2020, so Google is five years late to the party.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-pixel/">Google Pixel</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/pixel-10-magsafe-like-charging-rumor/">Pixel 10 Leak Reveals MagSafe-Like Wireless Charging Thanks to Apple</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pixel-10-leak-reveals-magsafe-like-wireless-charging-thanks-to-apple.2462540/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
