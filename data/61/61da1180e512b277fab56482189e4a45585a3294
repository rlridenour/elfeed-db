 
          <p>One of the very first games my father actually bought were the DOS games <em>Raptor</em> and <em>Hocus Pocus</em>. It involved going to an exchange centre to convert Belgian francs to American dollars and sending those bills overseas to Apogee HQ, praying that nothing happened with the envelope. If you were lucky, a month later the PC box arrived at your doorstep. That was a magical moment!</p>
<p>Most of the DOS games I played when I was a kid were just the shareware episodes that came with floppy disks of local computing magazines. Granddad subscribed to one of those magazines and the first thing we did when visiting the grandparents was <em>Copying That Floppy</em>. For quite a long time I didn&rsquo;t even realize I was just playing a demo: there were actually more episodes than this? Wow! Only if it was really <em>really</em> good, we bought it. Since those smaller games weren&rsquo;t simply available in the stores, we had to resort to the envelope postage method. That means we actually did something with that order information shown after quitting the game.</p>
<p>Then came the transition to the CD-ROM and the arrival of the internet that completely changed everything. Yes, we did get our hands on a few full games before that (<em>Don&rsquo;t Copy That Floppy</em>&mdash;we still did), but once burning CDs became cheap and easy, the floodgates were open. Many warez rips circulated in high school classes with the semi-local Dutch <a href="https://twilight-cd.com/releases/1998-2/twilight-020-0298020/">Twilight rip group</a> being the most popular one. We even used to pay for these releases, thinking this was the way to &ldquo;buy games&rdquo;. Whoops.</p>
<p>Those Twilight CD releases went on for quite some time. The above linked site neatly lists them all, including the accompanied CD art ant <code>README.TXT</code>, from the initial 1996 Dutch editions to the 2001 ones&mdash;eventually spawning more than 89 volumes. I distinctly remember the following 1998 release:</p>

</p>
<p>It contained iconic game releases such as Jedi Knight, the Redneck Rampage expansion, the Turok and Croc PC ports, and of course DirectX 5.0. By 1998, they were also packing in applications such as Macromedia Dreamweaver and Ulead Web Album 4.01. Oh, and <code>WINAMP17.EXE</code>&mdash;it really whips a llama&rsquo;s ass.</p>
<p>The weird thing about these game rips is that they were exactly that&mdash;rips. That is, in order to cram in that much games, they had to &ldquo;rip&rdquo; the original game CD-ROM by removing non-essential data. As a result, I played many late nineties games without the music or cut-scenes. It didn&rsquo;t even bother me that much as I didn&rsquo;t even know what the full package experience was like until I started buying games myself with the big box release of Diablo II. These could then be backed up using CloneCD.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in how such a Twilight warez release was put together, there&rsquo;s a great YouTube video by Elger Jonker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOAgSYei-xo">dissecting the series</a> digging even into CD sector details and timestamps. It&rsquo;s a big feat to keep the whole operation a secret for eight years while selling more than <code>60k</code> copies a month.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just cool to buy and share warez CDs in high school: it was the primary way to discover new games. Everybody had stacks upon stacks of CDs with nothing but illegal rips, cracks, serial key generators and more and nobody in my neighbourhood educated us on how not supporting the developers might eventually lead to studios closing. Something in the back of our heads told us it wasn&rsquo;t the way it was supposed to be but nobody stopped to think twice.</p>
<p>There were so many PC games I got to know via Twilight: Age of Empires, Rayman, Pandemonium, Unreal, &hellip; Simply too many to mention. In the late nineties and early noughties, instead of downloading demos, we bought and burned warez CDs. This might be a bold statement to make, but I owe a lot to those warez releases: it somehow acted as a gateway to PC game discovery.</p>
<p>One particular rip my dad downloaded (more on that later) contained Might &amp; Magic VIII and Wizardry 8&mdash;two of my now favourite games ever. As I fumbled about in these games, discovering Dagger Wound Island in MMVIII and exploring the abandoned monastery in Wiz8, I felt something tickling in my belly: raw excitement. I had no idea what was going on in these virtual worlds&mdash;how to assign skills, level up, make any kind of progress without repeatedly dying&mdash;but I knew I wanted more.</p>
<p>When I finally regained my ethical consciousness, I immediately went out and bought both games, but it was already too late: both New World Computing and Sir-Tech went bankrupt. All I could do was to mourn the great loss and source a used copy on eBay. Perhaps back then I was part of the problem. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m all reformed and better now: I now try to support as many creative studios as I can, even sometimes double dipping by buying digitally and physically.</p>

<p>Once the dial-up speeds started to accelerate beyond <code>1 kB/s</code>, my father discovered newsgroups that dumped binary headers concealing game rips. With Newsbin Pro (of course also cracked), it became trivial to download game rips yourself. Newsbin and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinAce">WinAce</a> made us proud Twilight-independent illegal gamers.</p>
<p>Instead, we basked in the <code>.RAR</code>, <code>.ACE</code>, and <code>.A01</code>, <code>.A02</code>, &hellip; files that were chunked into a few megabytes each to avoid file corruption with unstable connections. You could even repair broken files provided you also downloaded the checksum files. Yet sometimes, the whole time-consuming process of downloading these files ended up in a bust: too many numbered files were missing meaning we couldn&rsquo;t extract the contents, or it was password-protected and we failed to properly retrieve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FILE_ID.DIZ">FILE_ID.DIZ</a> or <code>.NFO</code> files.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, these <code>.NFO</code> files often urged the downloader to go out and buy these games. The warez group DEViANCE included a message like this:</p>

</code></pre><p>If this evokes nostalgic feelings for you, fear not: most of these files are archived. See for example <a href="https://defacto2.net/f/b42f38a">https://defacto2.net/f/b42f38a</a> that shows the info file for Human Head Studios&rsquo; Rune release where I lifted the above excerpt form, including obligatory ANSI art.</p>
<p>At some point, it felt like we even started a small family warez business ourselves. My father had early access to a ISDN and later DSL landline thanks to his work at the Belgian telephone company and we were early adopters of multiple CD-RW drives that burned hundreds of discs for friends and family. Newsbin Pro was pulling in files non-stop. Newsgroups were dismantled and new ones appeared happily continuing where the closed ones left off. To keep track of all these moving components, sites such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070209205229/http://www.nforce.nl/">nforce.nl</a> and <code>isonews.com</code> came in handy.</p>
<p>And then Napster/Kazaa/LimeWire made things even worse, especially for the music industry. By then the odd holiday work allowed me to spend money on PC big box releases and GBA/DS games. Even though of course I also curated a library of console ROMs, it was never as bad as PC games. We never modded any console we/I owned. It probably helped that we weren&rsquo;t into Sony stuff and usually had to buy a cartridge or a miniDVD for the GameCube that was a bit more involving to pirate.</p>
<p>I grew up with family and friends copying stuff. So I copied stuff. The ethical debate was never even considered, so I also didn&rsquo;t consider it. Some of these folks are still in denial and ask me why I bought that game when I can find it on The Pirate Bay. I feel guilty and wish my parents better educated us on this matter.</p>
<p>But at the same time, without Twilight and Newsbin Pro, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have discovered Might &amp; Magic VIII or Wizardry 8. For that, I am eternal in their debt.</p>
