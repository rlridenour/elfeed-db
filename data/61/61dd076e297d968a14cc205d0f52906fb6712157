<li>The flames shooting out are just water vapor</li>
<li>Convenient timer shuts off the “flames” automatically</li>
<li>Use filtered water only</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: No, and please, DO NOT pour a margarita into one of these things</li>
</ul><h1>No Fire Added</h1><p>What would happen if an Amazon Echo watched <em>Mad Max</em> too many times and said, “I’m done taking commands. From now on, all I do is make FIRE!”?</p>
<p>This. This is what would happen.</p>
<p>Basically, you get a couple little cylinders that do flame effects. And that phrasing is important. Flame <em>effects</em>. Because the flames are not real. They’re water vapor.</p>
<p>All you need to do is pour in some filtered water (that part seems important to mention), and you’re good to go. Faux flames for hours!</p>
<p>But you’re probably wondering, how realistic are they?</p>
<p>After all, we sell all sorts of not-quite-candles that claim to mimic the authentic experience: candles made of real wax but with twinkle lights built in; candles that are electronic but have real flames; little flickering tiki torch things that are actually bluetooth speakers; et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>You name it. If it pretends to be an amalgamation of wax and wick, we’ve probably sold it. (In fact, we’ve sold real, actual scented candles too, but for the sake of this discussion, we’ll stick with the imposters.)</p>
<p>So, where do these net out in the power rankings?</p>
<p>Pretty high!</p>
<p>The flame definitely looks more flame-y than the twinkle lights. And obviously, the flame possesses none of the actual danger of those fake candles with real flames (which do have a lot of safety features, in terms of tipping and stuff, but at the end of the day, make real fire).</p>
<p>If anything, our only complaint would be the flames look, at times, a little <em>too</em> intense.</p>
<p>Seriously, check them out in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfW7RArJaFg&ab_channel=QVCtv">this video</a>. Are we crazy to say the vibe is less ‘soothing flame dancing gently atop a candle’ and more ‘gas flare on an oil rig’?</p>
<p>Still, they look cool. Because they are cool.</p>
<p>So get a couple. You’ll enjoy them.</p>
