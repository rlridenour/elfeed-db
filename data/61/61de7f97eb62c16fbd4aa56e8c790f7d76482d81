<blockquote>
  <p>The White House communications team <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/2014365986388951194?s=20">posted a digitally altered
photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong,</a> a Minnesota social
justice activist, on Thursday that makes it appear that she was
weeping <a href="https://www.notus.org/immigration/pam-bondi-arrest-minneapolis-church-protesters-ice">during her arrest by federal agents</a>.</p>

<p>The image is highly realistic, bearing no watermark or other
indicator that the image has been doctored. The change is only
apparent when compared to a <a href="https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/2014357826081071513?s=20">different version of the same image
posted by the Department of Homeland Security</a> earlier in
the day.</p>

<p>The White House, which has adopted a combative, flippant tone on
its widely viewed social media pages, drew some backlash for the
post online. In response, White House deputy communications
director Kaelan Dorr called the image a “meme.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not a meme. It’s propaganda — an altogether false image presented as an actual photograph.</p>
