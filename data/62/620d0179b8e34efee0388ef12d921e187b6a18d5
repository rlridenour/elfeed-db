<p>And for my next Synolog DRM adventure, I decided to&hellip; not really adventuring.
I&rsquo;ve been thinking of setting up Owndrive, from there went towards Nextdrive, and after reading a few opinions in general, I landed on <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/synology-vs-nextcloud-which-is-better-for-a-home-server">Kevin&rsquo;s</a> review of both. As usual, it resulted in a head nod and a silent agreement.</p>
