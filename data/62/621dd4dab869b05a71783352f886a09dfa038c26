<p>Britain’s governing Labour Party has barred Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham from standing in the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election, triggering an internal party row over the decision and its implications for unity. Labour’s ruling body voted 8–1 against allowing Burnham to step down as mayor to run, with the party arguing it wanted to avoid an “unnecessary” mayoral election and the cost of using public money and resources. Critics on the party’s left and some allies of Burnham say the move looks designed to keep a potential leadership challenger away from Westminster, while Burnham publicly signaled disappointment and urged the party to stay united. The decision leaves Labour heading into the by-election with heightened scrutiny over internal decision-making even as it tries to keep focus on governing priorities.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/TqF9aLBMok_wVXixjuevzSXUjfoz5impghr3HhwnrcttCOqtYbzTt5IEhK3Y8bNgCJMo8xrIw4zWNnvSwl4DuwIx5-VR0rxTzdbm5pqzdoRsXdyZpYPs8CXzmd1gYMkXy-nlM5tkQwfo_dBqx1bRSRE7rOoddxY86bj6dVChSQ' alt='Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, amid reports Labour blocked his by-election bid.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who decided: The decision was taken by a small “officers’ group” within Labour’s ruling structures, reported as 10 members including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, which voted to reject Burnham’s request to seek selection.</li><li>Seat trigger: The by-election was set in motion after Labour MP Andrew Gwynne announced he would step down from the Gorton and Denton seat, creating an opening Burnham sought to use for a Westminster return.</li><li>Backlash sources: Reports describe anger among some Labour MPs and union backers, with allies calling the move a “huge mistake” and warning it could deepen internal factional tensions.</li><li>Strategic fallout: Commentary argues Starmer faced difficult options, but that blocking Burnham could raise questions about whether Labour prioritizes internal management over maximizing its electoral appeal.</li><li>Burnham’s next move: UK political coverage suggests Burnham will likely remain Greater Manchester mayor for now, continuing to build his profile outside Westminster rather than being tested in the by-election.</li></ul><blockquote>Andy Burnham is doing a great job as Mayor of Greater Manchester.
