When you're away from home and want to play your Nintendo Switch 2 on a larger display, you can do so if you have a USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. All you need is an app and a couple of accessories to get everything connected, as <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera demonstrates.<br/>

To use this setup, you need a USB-C &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that's able to run the latest version of iOS, and a Nintendo Switch. We're demonstrating with Nintendo's new Switch 2, but it also works with the original Switch, plus other Playstation and Xbox consoles.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and the Switch 2, you need to pick up an HDMI cable and a video capture card dongle, which is easy to get on Amazon for around &#36;20. Along with the hardware, you need to get an app that captures the video feed from your Switch and sends it to your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
We <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hdmi-monitor-orion/id6459355072">tested Orion</a>, which is free to use, but has a one-time &#36;5 upgrade for extra features like 4K upscaling.<br/>
<br/>
When you have all the components and the software, plug in the Switch 2 dock, then plug the HDMI cable into the dock. The other end of the HDMI cable connects to the video capture card, and the capture card's USB-C cable plugs into the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. From there, put the Switch 2 in the dock and power everything on.<br/>
<br/>
You should see your Switch 2's display come up on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and you're ready to play. There is a little bit of input lag, but it's minimal. You may not want to play online shooters, but offline games should be fine.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nintendo/">Nintendo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/02/nintendo-switch-2-ipad-display/">How to Use an iPad as a Nintendo Switch 2 Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-use-an-ipad-as-a-nintendo-switch-2-display.2460074/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
