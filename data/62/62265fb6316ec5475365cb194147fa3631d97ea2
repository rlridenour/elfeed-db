<p>French President Emmanuel Macron is preparing to relaunch national military service in a new, fully voluntary format, aiming to reinforce France’s armed forces without bringing back compulsory conscription suspended in the late 1990s. The scheme under discussion would offer young women and men a stint of around 10 months in uniform, contributing extra personnel for a military that Paris wants ready for higher-intensity conflict in Europe. Macron’s move follows repeated warnings from French officials that Russia’s war in Ukraine and its confrontation with NATO could spill beyond Ukraine’s borders, leaving European countries needing stronger defences and larger reserves. France, which has nuclear weapons and significant overseas commitments, joins several European neighbours that have recently introduced or revived forms of national service as they adapt to what leaders describe as a more dangerous security environment on the continent.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/HH1NaOn3LMAEkRvioXaHJkQc8NckUO1xH2xWQHEd80Bp6pi53ogtnhGZP8IWUdz1yvc_zDGGMUN7SABrGLxN8pL7wtSK5cP_FVzviwccBlhpJ45KFNC9joBsb-YcfrVUMlBFyACgeVsX8clKBm4b0onQNMydgLLpLvfQBXw39A' alt='French President Emmanuel Macron during a military-related ceremony ahead of his announcement of a new voluntary national service.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Program scale: The French government is working with a target of engaging tens of thousands of young volunteers annually by the mid‑2030s, with officials floating figures around 50,000 participants once the system is fully up and running.</li><li>Service options: Draft plans envisage several tracks, including operational military roles and support functions, allowing volunteers to contribute in different branches and at varying levels of physical and technical demand.</li><li>European trend: France’s step comes after countries such as Latvia and Croatia reintroduced compulsory service, and as Nordic and Baltic states maintain or tighten their own conscription systems in response to Russia.</li><li>Domestic debate: In France, politicians on the left have long promoted national service as a tool for social cohesion, while figures on the right emphasise patriotism and discipline, debates that are now intersecting with the armed forces’ call for more personnel.</li><li>Ukraine-war context: Macron’s announcement coincides with intense European diplomacy over Ukraine, where EU states are simultaneously supporting Kyiv, discussing future security guarantees, and examining how to expand their own militaries and defence industries.</li></ul><blockquote>France simply needs more manpower in the barracks given the scale of its ambitions and the growing threat from Moscow. - Unnamed Élysée official (quoted by Politico)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Emmanuel Macron / Élysée Palace: The Élysée frames the new service as a response to both young people’s expressed willingness to serve and the armed forces’ operational need to cope with what it calls an “acceleration of perils.”.
