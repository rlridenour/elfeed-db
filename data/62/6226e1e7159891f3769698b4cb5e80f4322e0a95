</ul><h1>Some Notes</h1><p><strong>The Actual Tasting Notes Provided To Us</strong></p>
<p>“Begins sweet and savory on the nose with raspberry jam, strawberry compote, anise, and tobacco leaf. Swirling brings fresh plums, red licorice, dried oregano, and hints of cassis. Very fresh and medium bodied, the mouthfeel showcases a combination of ripe red fruit and dried herb flavors, with notes of potpourri and rooibos tea. The mid-palate is round and creamy, with plenty of sweetness, but without losing its freshness.”</p>
<p><strong>The Tasting Notes, But From Someone Who’s Never Eaten Anything Fresh In Their Life</strong></p>
<p>“Smells like the stuff inside Gushers, and also Twizzlers and black licorice candy, plus some cigarettes. Tastes a bit like the stuff inside Fig Newtons, but not exactly, also Twizzlers again, and the little green flecks that are in pizza sauce sometimes. Mouthfeel brings to mind red Starburst and breadstick seasoning, and ends with notes of dryer sheet and unsweet soda.”</p>
<p><strong>The Tasting Notes, But From A Student Who Definitely Didn’t Do The Homework</strong></p>
<p>“Wines of today possess much depth, and this wine is no different. Bringing a plethora of smells and tastes, the Desert Wind 2019 Ruah Estate Vineyard Red will please the palates of those who enjoy red wine blends and also liquids that are roughly six years old. It certainly possesses much of the mouthfeel, notes, and bouquet one would expect from such a variety of wine, but also has some unique flavors too. In conclusion, it is a wine for drinking.”</p>

<p>“What the fuck is this? Who the fuck made this? My friend, I have <em>been</em> to the desert, and the wind there tastes <em>NOTHING</em> like this! Bunch of fucking berry smells and plum notes? Absolute bullshit. Whoever made this should be fired.”</p>
