I haven't watched enough Japanese films to know if the style of parallel plots happening here is classic, or something unique to this film, but it works.</p><p>It's a comedy dipped with serious food passion (some sexual food-related scenes emphasize that), which centers around ramen noodles. The reason I picked this movie up in the first place is that its first scene is set in a ramen noodle restaurant, which is called - of course - Tampopo. </p><p>There's a bit too much women-cliche-gender role in this movie, but it is from the 80s and it is from a more traditional cinema, so that didn't surprise me; still, it was a bit annoying that they had to slap that "a woman chef! amazing!" thing at the end.</p>
