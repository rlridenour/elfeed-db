Logitech today announced an updated version of its MX Master series mouse, the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-4">MX Master 4</a>, which features haptic feedback and introduces a few other changes while remaining largely faithful to the original design.<br/>

Apart from cleaner-looking frosted buttons and a more minimalist bottom, the MX Master 4 looks very similar to the S3. The feel is, however, slightly different – the new model swaps its predecessor's soft, ribbed finish for a smooth, hard-plastic body and buttons, although there is some softer material around the right-hand side and on the surface where you rest your thumb. <br/>
<br/>
The new haptic feedback delivers subtle vibrations near the thumb for scrolling, navigation, and selection. Haptics also accompany gestures and shortcuts accessed via the Actions Ring feature (now with a dedicated button under the thumb), which can be set up via Logitech's Options+ software. You also get vibrations with a low battery warning or Bluetooth pairing.<br/>
<br/>
Logitech has also updated the MX Master 4's connectivity. The mouse now ships with a USB-C Bolt receiver for lower-latency wireless connections and improved security, while still supporting Bluetooth for multi-device pairing. Battery life is still claimed at up to 70 days on a full charge, and fast charging via USB-C can deliver three hours of use in just one minute.<br/>

Other improvements include quieter, more precise clicks, double the connectivity strength, and an updated MagSpeed scroll wheel that promises smoother transitions between ratchet and free-spin modes. <br/>
