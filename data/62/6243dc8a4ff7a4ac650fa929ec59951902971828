<blockquote>
  <p>The world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15
that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen.</p>

<p>I, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that
the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete
Hegseth, the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at
11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons
packages, targets, and timing.</p>

<p>This is going to require some explaining. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The notion of a journalist being accidentally included in a war-planning group of national security leaders — and the very notion that U.S. national security leaders would use Signal to conduct such a group — is so preposterous that Goldberg had assumed the group was a hoax, with the intention of embarrassing him. But it was real.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Earlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his
Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe,
Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some
of my questions: Is the “Houthi PC small group” a genuine Signal
thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on
the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I
was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I
removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration
officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the
officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger
American personnel?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll add: Do they sniff glue and eat paste?</p>

<p>There’s so much chaos at the moment resulting from the Trump administration’s actions during these first two months that it’s easy to overlook one salient fact: Trump has  chosen to surround himself with idiots.</p>
