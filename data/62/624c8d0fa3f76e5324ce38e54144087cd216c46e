Álvaro Ramírez has a new Emacs app available. The app, <a href="https://xenodium.com/introducing-winpulse">winpulse</a>, is his answer to keeping track of the active window. What happens is that every time the focus changes the new window flashes so you get a visual indication of the new window.

I had the <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=11874">same problem</a> but solved it in a different way. I made the modeline of the active window a strikingly different color so that it&rsquo;s easy to spot the one with focus. I like my solution better because the indication has longevity. If I get up and then return to my computer, I can immediately see which window is active. The nice thing about my solution is that it simply amounts to a <code>set-face-attribute</code> as you can see in my post or below.

None of this will come as news to Ramírez, of course. He simply prefers a different way of indicating the active window and, as always, Emacs makes it easy to have it your way.

Ramírez says the the app is brand new so it won&rsquo;t be on Melpa yet but you can get it from its <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/winpulse">GitHup repository</a>. If you like just having a momentary indication of the active window, Ramírez&rsquo;s solution may be just what you&rsquo;re looking for. If you prefer something a little stickier, changing the color of the modeline has worked very well for me. You could, I suppose even use both methods.

<p>
For the record, here&rsquo;s the current code from my <code>inet.el</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(set-face-attribute 'mode-line-active nil
<span style="color: #483d8b;">:foreground</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"black"</span> <span style="color: #483d8b;">:background</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"goldenrod"</span> <span style="color: #483d8b;">:box</span> '(<span style="color: #483d8b;">:line-width</span> 1 <span style="color: #483d8b;">:color</span>
<span style="color: #8b2252;">"black"</span>))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Unless you have a tan background, <code>goldenrod</code> probably isn&rsquo;t the right color for you but you can experiment to see what works well with your theme.</p>
