<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="https://writingslowly.com/2025/04/15/why-not-publish-all-your.html" target="_blank">this piece</a> from Writing Slowly, about whether or not we should publish all our notes online. While they’re still percolating.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Working with garage door up” is a popular way of describing it.</p>
<p>They came up with four pluses and four minuses for publishing all one’s notes online, but it wasn’t a draw. My conclusion is the same: there are positives to the approach but it’s not for them, or for me. Perhaps with a focused subset of notes on a specific topic, but no way with everything.</p>
<p>No one needs to see the literary equivalent of us in our underwear, before we’ve had a shower and cleaned our teeth. While uncombed hair and mismatched clothing are fine, some parts of the thinking process may be best left behind closed doors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The image that for me best sums up this process of making short notes to create longer pieces of writing is that of my little worm farm. All sorts of scraps get dumped in at the top. And mostly unseen, the worms turn everything into nourishing compost. —<a href="https://writingslowly.com/2024/03/31/when-it-comes.html" target="_blank">Writing Slowly</a></p>

<p>To me this is like practising the piano when other people are around. I may be repeating the same tune over and over with different dynamics, or trying out melodies that don’t work (yet), but the experience is focused on the music. I’m fully clothed, and some drawers in the practice room stay shut or are hidden out of sight.</p>

<p>To finish off here are some links I saved this week that look useful for future projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zsolt has made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYReYJQfqjI" target="_blank">video</a> explaining in detail how to self-publish a book using only free tools, including Obsidian and Pandoc.</li>
<li>Roni is keeping a <a href="https://mementomori.social/@rolle/114359173615078071" target="_blank">personal changelog</a> for specific projects.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Every day I add something to the list, and it makes me feel like I’m achieving something. This is an important part of recovering from feelings of inadequacy and workaholic tendencies.”</li>
<li>Unreasonably desirable (and expensive) Mac screensaver: the <a href="https://bauhausclock.com/?ref_id=OHNC3R1OC" target="_blank">Bauhaus Clock</a>. It’s interesting to observe how higher prices can increase one’s perception of quality. Intriguingly for a digital product the Bauhaus Clock screensaver is currently unavailable (2025-04-21). How dare they make it even more appealing by saying I can’t have it! I’ve kept a splurge fund ever since reading The Barefoot Investor years ago, so this would be a guilt-free purchase. The link above is a referral link that won’t earn me anything except a place higher up in the cue for when the clock is available again.</li>
