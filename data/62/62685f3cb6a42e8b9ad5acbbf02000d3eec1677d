<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2025-03-01 Sat]</span></span>: Genaro suggested <a href="https://www.beorgapp.com/">beorg</a>, so now I've
got that on my iPad and it seems to be doing fine
for browsing my Org Mode files. I think I'll set
up WebDAV on our network-attached storage (NAS)
and see what that's like, too.
</p>

<p>
Also, apparently, it's been about three weeks, whoops!

<p>
I've had this iPad Air 13" for about <del>two</del> three weeks
now, and I'm slowly settling into how the
different pieces of tech can work together and how
things can flow.

Getting used to SuperNote A5X + iPad Air 13"
</p>

<p>
SuperNote A5X:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I prefer it for writing, sketchnotes
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>pen feel</li>
<li>strokes: exactly as I expect, no hooks or smoothing</li>
<li>lighter weight</li>
<li>no backlight</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also nice for reading EPUBs, PDFs</li>
</ul>

<p>
iPad Air:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Libby for library e-books</li>
<li>Procreate, Simply Draw for art</li>
<li>NetNewswire for RSS</li>
<li>Copying &amp; pasting is nice</li>
</ul>

<p>
Procreate replaces spaces with underscores and doesn't overwrite files. Instead, it adds 2 to the filename.
</p>

<p>
I want to start building up thought maps so I can see quick summaries
and open questions. The laptop is probably the best place to do it.
</p>

<p>
Org Mode files with sketches, text, and links
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Export to HTML</li>
<li>Also, add export to HTML gallery view?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Private sketches: Available through DS
</p>

<p>
Private web server on the NAS? I can just run my sketch viewer.
</p>

<p>
DS: Synology NAS drive
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Program the server to consolidate files?</li>
<li>Consider moving metadata to subdir for easier flipping?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ideas for next steps:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Figure out easier doodling from iPad: resample, autocrop, insert with HTML markup</li>
<li>Automate recolour/rename from Dropbox (phone? server?)</li>
</ul>


</details>

<p>
On the iPad, I've been mostly using:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://procreate.com/">Procreate</a>: drawing, painting</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getnoteful.com/">Noteful</a>: sketchnotes and thinking, although I'm not completely happy with the pen setup</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zoom-notes.com/">ZoomNotes</a>: also experimenting with this one, might be better for relating several sketches together</li>
<li><a href="https://hellosimply.com/">Simply Piano / Simply Sing / Simply Draw</a>: tutorials</li>
<li><a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>: RSS feeds</li>
<li><a href="https://libbyapp.com/">Libby</a>: reading</li>
</ul>

<p>
Moving data around is a bit of a hodgepodge:
internal webserver or Dropbox for the Supernote,
Dropbox and Synology's DS Drive for the iPad, and
Syncthing for the server. I'm sure that'll settle
down eventually as I figure out a better flow.

</figure>

</div>

<p>
I like how drawing, singing, and playing
the piano give me a way to distract myself from
the urge to nag A+. Still definitely just starting
out, but it's fun anyway. It's nice to be able to
breeze through library e-books again, too.
</p>

<p>
I notice I've been missing the occasional calendar
reminder from my phone, so that's probably a sign
that I need to (a) set up the iPad for calendar
access as well, (b) have more distinct
notifications on my phone, and (c) take the phone
with me as I go from room to room. On the plus
side, that probably means I've been getting in the
zone, yay! It seems a little easier to just take
the whole stack of phone+Supernote+iPad when I
move rooms instead of leaving them in different
places and then having to go find them. The laptop
is a lot heavier, though, so I tend to move that
on an as-needed basis.
</p>

<p>
I set up a copy of <a href="https://sketches.sachachua.com">sketches.sachachua.com</a> server
on the NAS (so it's just on the local network)
pointing to my private sketches directory, so now
I can flip through my private sketches fairly
easily. They're mostly just various thoughts on
parenting and emotions and life. Now I can review
them from either my iPad or my laptop, yay!
</p>

<p>
Ideas for next steps:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Keep distracting myself from fretting about A+
by completing various art/music tutorials.</li>
<li>Have fun doodling.</li>
<li>Contemplate whether I want to read my Org files
on the iPad, and what the best way of doing it
might be. (<a href="https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice">Organice</a>? <a href="https://plainorg.com/">PlainOrg</a>? Just do a
PDF/EPUB export of stuff I'm focusing on? - update 2025-03-01: added <a href="https://www.beorgapp.com/">Beorg</a>)</li>
<li>See if A+ is up for field trips to the art
gallery or museum.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The iPad Air seems like a good addition. Let's see
what I can do with it.</p>
