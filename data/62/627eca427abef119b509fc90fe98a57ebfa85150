<p>A powerful earthquake of about 7.5–7.6 magnitude struck late Monday off the Pacific coast of Aomori in northeastern Japan, shaking buildings across a wide area, sending books and furniture tumbling, and prompting tsunami warnings and evacuation orders for roughly 90,000 people in coastal communities from Hokkaido down to Chiba. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported tsunami waves generally under one meter, observed at several northeastern ports, and later downgraded and then lifted all tsunami warnings and advisories after no large waves materialized. Authorities say dozens of people—around 23 to 34 depending on the count—sustained mostly mild injuries and damage has been limited to cracked roads, some building damage and at least one reported fire, with no major destruction or nuclear power irregularities detected. In a cautious follow‑up, JMA issued a rare &quot;megaquake&quot; advisory explaining that the tremor has slightly increased, to about 1%, the short‑term probability of a magnitude‑8‑class quake along parts of Japan’s northeastern coast, urging residents to stay alert for strong aftershocks and review their disaster preparations, even as daily life resumes in most areas.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/xgpEVZXlWEWI0J4Anb0haiJoHb7T1a1PGzHMU-AyT_KCm3P9fpN3c90zlfOT_zvMUfFUDXnaTZQFKvt-6EptA3ExmK2tZALo7JMmfn5MkKtrG4OWEgTZmXgWfUzN1I5qw1ltIlVKfnLDDt5wYei-BPpWKNIdFyGU_1ctm-Rmsub1rgPLos1ErVcnc3hDa5beSOdCI6kPHg6Dtb_j_wQ' alt='A vehicle sits on a collapsed section of road in Tohoku Town, Aomori Prefecture, after the offshore earthquake in northern Japan.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Strength and shaking: The offshore quake registered an “upper 6” on Japan’s seven‑level seismic intensity scale in Hachinohe, Aomori, a level at which it is difficult to remain standing and people may have to move by crawling.</li><li>Transport disruptions: East Japan Railway temporarily halted some services in the affected region and other northern lines experienced delays while tracks and infrastructure were checked for damage.</li><li>Tsunami observations: Tsunami waves between roughly 20 and 70 centimeters were recorded at several ports along the northeastern Pacific coast, including communities that quickly opened evacuation centers.</li><li>Rare advisory system: It is the first time since Japan introduced its megaquake alert framework in December 2022 that officials have issued such a warning for coastal regions from Hokkaido through Sanriku after a large foreshock‑type event.</li><li>Risk modelling: Government scenario models for a worst‑case future offshore megaquake along the Japan Trench project potential tsunami heights up to 30 meters, large‑scale building losses, and mass casualties in dozens of northern municipalities.</li></ul><blockquote>It is unclear whether a large-scale earthquake will occur, but everyone should heed the call to take precautions to protect their own lives. - Tsukasa Morikubo, Cabinet official for disaster management</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA): JMA officials stressed that while the statistical chance of a magnitude‑8‑class event remains low at about 1%, the latest quake has slightly raised that probability in the coming week and warrants close attention to aftershock risks.
