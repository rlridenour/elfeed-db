         
         <p>These are my minimalist themes. They use few colours and will appear
mostly monochromatic in many contexts. Styles involve the careful use
of typography, such as italics and bold italics.</p>

<p>If you want maximalist themes in terms of colour, check my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code>
package. For something in-between, which I would consider the best
“default theme” for a text editor, opt for my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code>.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Update to doric-themes 0.5.0</h2>

<h3>Enjoy the two new members of the collection</h3>

<p>These are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-siren</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-mermaid</code>. The former is a light
theme while the latter is dark. Both themes offer a marine vibe
combined with warm hues. Check the updated screenshots of all the
Doric themes: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/doric-themes-pictures">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/doric-themes-pictures</a>.</p>

<h3>Support for transient.el semantic faces</h3>

<p>Those are used when the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient-semantic-coloring</code> is
set to a non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> value (the default). They are designed to indicate
different types of key, such as those that keep the transient in place
as opposed to exiting it.</p>

<p>The old style of making all key bindings look the same is still
available if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient-semantic-coloring</code> is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>.</p>

<h3>Semantic Emacs Lisp faces</h3>

<p>This is a new feature coming in Emacs 31. Users can opt in to it by
setting the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elisp-fontify-semantically</code> to a non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>
value. When active, Emacs Lisp buffers will apply highlights to more
elements of the syntax. Those will still conform with the minimalist
style of the Doric themes, but users at least get the benefits of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elisp-add-help-echo</code>.</p>

<h3>Font-lock faces for function calls and use of variables</h3>

<p>Those are typically applied by major modes that are power by
tree-sitter. Again, the styles are minimalist.</p>

<h3>More faces or face groups are covered</h3>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ibuffer’s Emacs 31 faces (patched by me in emacs.git)</li>
  <li>flymake’s Emacs 31 faces (again, my patch in core)</li>
  <li>diff-hl package</li>
  <li>git-gutter package</li>
  <li>org-habit</li>
  <li>minibuffer-nonselected for Emacs 31</li>
  <li>eglot-highlight-symbol-face</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ert-test-result-unexpected</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ert-test-result-expected</code>,

</ul>

<h3>Refinements to already supported faces</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">calendar-today</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-date-selected</code> are similar but
different enough to stand apart. I initially made them look identical
because I thought they would never appear in the same context. Thanks
to Rudolf Adamkovič for telling me they could actually be collocated,
hence their disambiguation. This was done in issue 20:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/doric-themes/issues/20">https://github.com/protesilaos/doric-themes/issues/20</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient-argument</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient-value</code> have a background to
make them easier to spot. This is because they convey information
about the state of the transient interface, which typically is important.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transient’s mismatching keys are dimmed out instead of being
underlined, because this looks better in context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-agenda-clocking</code> has a more pronounced background.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Idem for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eldoc-highlight-function-argument</code> and its counterparts in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lsp-mode</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">geiser</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Org check boxes are rendered with a bold weight, while quote
blocks are in italics. Thanks to Rudolf Adamkovič for the patch in
pull request 18: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/doric-themes/pull/18">https://github.com/protesilaos/doric-themes/pull/18</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Notmuch cryptography-related faces have more refined styles to
both stand out better while avoiding exaggerations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Custom user interface buttons inherit from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">variable-pitch</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The current line number in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display-line-numbers-mode</code> uses just a
bold weight to avoid exaggerations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
