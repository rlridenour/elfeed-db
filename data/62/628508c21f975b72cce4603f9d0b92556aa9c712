iOS 26.2 beta 3 includes new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> AirDrop functionality, providing a way for two people to share files temporarily without having to add each other as contacts.<br/>

There is a new option to get an AirDrop code, which can then be shared with someone who is not in your contacts list. The code provides AirDrop access for a 30-day period, with options to remove access in the Settings app.<br/>
<blockquote>Share a secure code with people not in your contacts to use AirDrop. You will be able to find each other for the next 30 days. You can manage access in Settings.</blockquote><br/>
When you generate a code, the person that you're planning to use AirDrop with can input that code so that your devices can communicate with one another.<br/>
<br/>
There are already options to turn AirDrop off entirely, limit AirDrop to contacts only, or turn AirDrop on for everyone for 10 minutes. The code-based option provides a way to create a connection with someone you don't want to create a contact card for, while avoiding having to turn AirDrop on for all people nearby.<br/>
<br/>
People you have shared a one-time code with can be managed by opening up the Settings app, selecting the General section, choosing AirDrop, and tapping on "Manage Known AirDrop Contacts."<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ios-26-2-airdrop-codes/">iOS 26.2 Adds Temporary AirDrop Access With Shareable Codes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-2-adds-temporary-airdrop-access-with-shareable-codes.2471348/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
