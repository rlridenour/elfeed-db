<p>I am just playing around with writing some sort of &ldquo;techy&rdquo; blog, trying to focus on a couple of my favourite things in the world, namely linux and emacs, so I thought I would do the best productive thing in the world and just start to type.</p>
<p>I have set up this blog in a certain way using a static web site generator called Hugo, but more on that later down the road.</p>
<p>For now I want to just focus on describing what I am tinkering around with at the moment regarding emacs, as yes, I am always tinkering, like a good &lsquo;ol emacs user.  Yes I am old, but more on that later down the road&hellip;</p>
<p>I am writing this post in org mode and am trying to figure out how to insert an image, of course the first point of call would be <strong>org-download</strong>, I have tried this package a few times in the past but never quite got off the ground.  I understand the concept and would love to be able to drag and drop an image straight into an org file.</p>
<p>This of course can be accomplished using org-download but for publishing my blog it doesn&rsquo;t quite cut the mustard.  Hugo uses org files natively and rather than defining a <strong>[[file:</strong> type org link it omits the file reference and forward slash starts a reference to the <em>org-hugo-base-dir</em> which would be where my static image files reside.</p>
<p>I had a bit of a hunt around and although I could define which directory the image would be dumped when draggging the file from the file explorer I would probably need to change this for each new post and even then I would need to remove the <strong>file:</strong> from the link reference.</p>
<p>So I found a simple method:</p>
<ul>
<li>In emacs dired the directory I want to drag the image</li>
<li>Drag the image, the file is dropped nicely</li>
<li>Use my favourite dired command at the moment <strong>0 w</strong> to get the full path of the
file name</li>
<li>yank the filename that is on the clipboard into the blog org, &ldquo;M-d&rdquo; the start of the path up to the Hugo base directory</li>
<li>Wrap the link in double brackets</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I said simple, the list of steps looks less simple but as part of the emacs workflow and my emacs muscle memory kicking in I think this provides at present a decent solution.</p>
<p>Here is an image of me using the technique so there!:</p>

<p>It took me about 10 seconds!, not too shabby</p>
<p>Next step, I might look to a good spellchecker, flycheck, aspell, hunspell and all that!</p>
