Apple has reached a new agreement with Tencent that will allow the company to process payments and collect a 15% commission on purchases made inside WeChat mini games and mini apps on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, establishing a major new revenue stream in China after over a year of negotiations, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/apple-and-tencent-agree-to-15-fee-on-wechat-mini-game-purchases"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.<br/>

Under the arrangement, Apple will begin handling in-app payment processing for qualifying mini apps and mini games distributed inside WeChat, China's dominant all-purpose mobile platform. Developers participating in the system will need to adopt specific Apple software requirements, including a feature that allows parents to share a child's age range. <br/>
<br/>
Unlike users in the rest of the world, most Chinese &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users do not access services by downloading separate apps from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Instead, they use WeChat as a single interface for services, utilities, and entertainment. These functions are powered by a vast network of mini apps contained entirely within WeChat. <br/>
<br/>
Purchases made through these mini apps have historically not generated &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; commission because many developers direct users to external payment systems. As a result, Apple's new agreement gives the company a foothold in a major segment of Chinese mobile payments from which it previously received no revenue.<br/>
<br/>
While the new 15% commission is half of Apple's standard 30% rate for many &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; transactions, <em>Bloomberg</em> estimates that the size of the WeChat ecosystem makes the agreement potentially worth billions of dollars to Apple. The agreement is expected to be disclosed publicly by the companies at a later date.<br/>
