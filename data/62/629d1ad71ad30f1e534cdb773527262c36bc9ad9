Joshua Blais has an interesting post that looks at the idea of <a href="https://joshblais.com/posts/emacs-for-everything/#the-top">using Emacs for everything</a>. That&rsquo;s a familiar meme for us Emacsers, of course, but you don&rsquo;t often see a careful, considered examination of the idea. Blais is an Emacs user so his post is, naturally, supportive of the idea but he <i>does</i> try to give both sides of the issue.
</p>
<p>
Blais&rsquo; main argument is built around the flow concept. Interrupting a knowledge worker&rsquo;s flow can have devastating effects on their productivity. These interruptions include context switches and one study suggests that context switching and multitasking takes up around 60% of our working time. That seems high to me but whatever the value, it&rsquo;s certainly significant.
</p>
<p>
One of the virtues of Emacs is that virtually all your text based tasks can be done in Emacs. That&rsquo;s significant because the editor provides a uniform interface to all those tasks. Indeed, you can even slip it into other apps with packages like <a href="https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-everywhere">Emacs Everywhere</a> that allow you to bring up an Emacs window to edit some app&rsquo;s text area. For example, I use it with iMessage so that I can compose my texts in Emacs.
</p>
<p>
The advantage to doing most things in Emacs is that you avoid context switches and can better stay in the flow. A secondary benefit, as least for me, is that it provides a single set of muscle memories to deal with. As I&rsquo;ve said before, I do better with a single set of keybindings so folding everything possible into Emacs is a win for me.
</p>
<p>
Blais also considers and dismisses the argument that Emacs takes so long to learn that you never regain the time &ldquo;lost&rdquo; to learning it. Even a few seconds thought is enough to recognize that idea for the silliness it is but Blais makes the point that if you aren&rsquo;t using Emacs you&rsquo;re still spending time learning other utilities that Emacs would otherwise handle. I know this first hand. Before I came to Emacs I was a long time command line user and spent years learning to use it effectively. Now I rarely use the command line; everything I need to do I can do from within Emacs.

Blais&rsquo; post is well worth a few minutes of your time whether or not you&rsquo;re an Emacs user. Take a look.</p>
