Apple may reposition the Apple logo on the back of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> for the first time in six years, according to a new leak that points to the redesigned top camera system potentially requiring the visual shift.<br/>
<br/>

The claim originates from the leaker known as "Majin Bu," who posted an image and description of the alleged change on <a href="https://x.com/majinbuofficial/status/1938945546556977532?s=61">social media</a> and their <a href="https://t.co/xeC6d0oBeN">personal blog</a>. According to Bu, the Apple logo will move to be noticeably lower on the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;, closer to the bottom-center of the device's rear. The shift is apparently necessitated by the new, full-width camera bar that is expected to span the entire width of the back of the device. The camera design is as a significant departure from the current module layout, with both the flash and LiDAR scanner moving to the right edge of the device.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first report to link the anticipated top camera redesign with a repositioning of the Apple logo, but the change could make sense. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; is expected to move to a new aluminum frame that encompasses almost the entire rear, with a cutout for a glass squircle below the full-width aluminum camera bump to enable wireless charging. As a result, it could make sense for the Apple logo to be centered within that glass cutout. <br/>
<br/>
However, moving the Apple logo could cause some amount of confusion among users or require changes to the way MagSafe-compatible accessories are designed. This is because since its introduction with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12, the Apple logo has indicated where users should align <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> accessories, with the magnets embedded beneath the center of the back panel around the logo.<br/>

<br/>
Majin Bu added that a company which makes accessories for Apple devices has begun adapting their case production based on this new logo placement. In one image shared on his website, Majin Bu shows a transparent case with a break in the circular &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; ring to expose the repositioned Apple logo. This suggests that Apple may not be altering the internal placement of the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; magnet array, which would otherwise require extensive changes to a broad range of accessories. Accessory manufacturers are said to be watching the situation closely. <br/>

Leaker Sonny Dickson has since corroborated the rumor with digital schematics, suggesting that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> accessories will move to a new design with a break in the circular &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; ring to expose the repositioned Apple logo:<br/>

Apple has made notable changes to the placement and styling of the rear logo in the past. From the original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; through the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X, the logo was placed higher up on the back, and a small "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;" inscription appeared toward the bottom. With the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 lineup, Apple removed the "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;" wordmark entirely and centered the Apple logo on the rear for visual balance with the new square camera bump. This layout has remained consistent across all subsequent models, including the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-planning-to-change-iphone-17-logo-placement/">Apple Planning to Change iPhone 17 Pro&#039;s Logo Placement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-planning-to-change-iphone-17-pros-logo-placement.2459924/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
