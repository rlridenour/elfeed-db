<p>Severe monsoon rains combined with back-to-back tropical cyclones have triggered catastrophic floods and landslides across Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, killing more than 1,300 people and displacing millions over the past week. Authorities report that while many waterways have begun to recede, entire communities remain cut off, with damaged bridges, blocked roads and washed-out hillsides hampering rescue teams and deliveries of food, fuel and clean water. Sri Lanka has declared a state of emergency in response to what its president called the country’s most challenging natural disaster in its history, as crews search for hundreds of missing people after deadly landslides. In Indonesia’s Aceh and North Sumatra regions, survivors describe long waits for fuel and supplies and growing frustration at the slow pace of aid, even as national governments and international humanitarian groups scale up airlifts, medical support and temporary shelters to reach remote villages.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/2b_IgSaMM5jSGD5HXqogv7iBjPGWXqP_VW_bbGt9YohHJ2V8XuheKISsqiUBw25mKJ1dxtZJftfpHDyw9oLKZuF-6B4yH396jYB3Pc92' alt='Villagers cross a river in Bireuen, Aceh, Indonesia, using a makeshift cable car after a bridge was destroyed by flash floods.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Regions affected: The floods and landslides have struck wide areas of Indonesia’s Sumatra island, Sri Lanka’s central and western districts, southern Thailand, northern Malaysia and parts of Vietnam, stretching emergency services across South and Southeast Asia.</li><li>Infrastructure damage: Fast-moving water and mud have destroyed bridges, blocked highways, damaged power lines and reshaped hillsides, leaving some villages reachable only by boat or helicopter and complicating the delivery of relief supplies.</li><li>Survivors’ frustration: In Indonesia’s worst-hit zones, people sheltering in public buildings and tents report going days with limited food, clean water or fuel and express anger that assistance has not kept pace with the scale of the disaster.</li><li>Scale of displacement: Evacuations and flood damage have forced about a million people in Indonesia alone to leave their homes, joining hundreds of thousands elsewhere in the region in temporary shelters and evacuation centers.</li><li>Government measures: Sri Lanka’s emergency declaration unlocks military resources, special funds and fast-track procedures for evacuations and rebuilding, while Indonesian officials coordinate with humanitarian agencies to deploy additional rescue teams and logistical support to isolated districts.</li></ul><blockquote>People are worried about running out of fuel - Erna Mardhiah</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Sri Lanka: The president has framed the flooding and landslides as the most challenging natural disaster the country has ever faced, justifying the nationwide state of emergency to mobilize extra resources and speed up relief operations.
