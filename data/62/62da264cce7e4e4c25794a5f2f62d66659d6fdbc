<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he did not “walk back” his Davos speech during a phone call initiated by President Donald Trump, disputing a public account from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The dispute lands as Ottawa and Washington head toward talks on renewing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), after Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Canada. Carney has framed Trump’s tariff threats as negotiation positioning and says Canada is preparing responses that include investment at home and deeper ties abroad, while keeping the door open to reshaping the bilateral relationship.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/rTKUnQCSygz78pvs_nE4U6TbaGPTDIwPU6vbkGPj8wOzJD8TYtrCgz6c1LGgE3DmhEpwmIRGVMc5YZdlFn4Oj1sG9Zgngxmji9F9Sh0v0245' alt='Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks during the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 20, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Bessent’s account: Bessent told Fox News he was “in the Oval” when Trump spoke to Carney and said Carney was “very aggressively walking back” remarks from Davos, a claim Carney publicly rejected.</li><li>Davos message: In Davos, Carney said the US-led rules-based order faced a “rupture” and urged “middle powers” to reduce reliance on US economic influence that he described as being used as “coercion”.</li><li>Diversification push: Carney said Canada plans to diversify away from the United States, including pursuing a dozen new trade deals, even as it remains open to changes under USMCA.</li><li>Broader call agenda: Carney said the leaders’ call also touched on Arctic security as well as Ukraine and Venezuela, signaling a wider agenda beyond tariffs.</li><li>Personal barbs: Politico reported Trump criticized Carney over a China deal, said he had disinvited him from a “Board of Peace,” and again used the term “governor” in remarks about Canada.</li></ul><blockquote>To be absolutely clear — and I said this to the president — I meant what I said in Davos.
