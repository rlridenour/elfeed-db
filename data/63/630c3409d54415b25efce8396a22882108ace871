<p>Spain has begun three days of national mourning after a high-speed train derailed and collided with another train near Adamuz in the southern region of Andalucía on Sunday night. Authorities say at least 40 people were killed, while large numbers of passengers were injured and taken to hospitals across the region. Investigators have launched a full inquiry, with officials calling aspects of the crash unusual because it occurred on a straight section of track and initial accounts suggested neither train was speeding. Rescue and recovery operations have continued into the week as crews worked through damaged carriages and debris at the cordoned-off site.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DMMfBOMbXJmSgzNehfBSQd7r9gmVtKW9SAYLBS9B4vczJVqrIQaqdUikGMhcUmJSIFSJiKw7H6OAfCT6SclGJ8HfVdEw1Uotrsw9OLU_moVV-esVOsc7JuvrIve7YycI_O67BqFhFJ5ptmd5_hlNTHfNP_q3zZIROiIKqVpYCWNuuMkqsnecV1cYkuLpg-wtBOzMpGIhwRB-J2pYvpmuYhKp6HL7PqCEjjzec5yIPoA4XtRP8RI' alt='Members of the Spanish Civil Guard, along with other emergency personnel, working next to one of the trains involved in the accident in Adamuz on Monday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Possible track fault: A source familiar with the inquiry said investigators found a broken joint on the rails at the crash site, a detail now being scrutinized as a potential factor in the derailment.</li><li>Operator and route: One of the trains involved was operated by Iryo and was traveling from Malaga to Madrid when it derailed near Adamuz, according to officials cited in reports.</li><li>Hospital updates: Regional authorities said dozens of people remained hospitalized after the crash, including patients in intensive care, as hospitals managed a large influx of trauma cases.</li><li>Victims identified: Reporting on those killed described victims that included a police officer, journalists, and a family returning from a musical, highlighting how widely the tragedy touched everyday life.</li><li>Scale in Europe: Some coverage described the collision as among Europe’s deadliest rail crashes in decades, underscoring why Spain’s investigation is drawing attention beyond its borders.</li></ul><blockquote>This is a day of sorrow for all of Spain - Pedro Sánchez</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Spanish government: National leaders declared three days of mourning and pledged a full investigation to determine why the crash happened and how to prevent repeats.
