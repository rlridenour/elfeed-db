<p>Once a digital piece of art has been created then it is time to print it.  A few tweaks are required in my image editor of choice and that is GIMP.</p>
<p>Import the image into GIMP and perform the following to tweak the image so the printed image is as close to the digital image as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>exposure : 1.3</li>
<li>brightness-contrast : 10</li>
<li>saturation : 1.24</li>
</ul>
<p>and now to print, here are the typical setting that will work:</p>

<p>I tend to print on glossy photo paper these days but generally I think it is best to select Photo / Photo paper as these tend to produce the better results.</p>
