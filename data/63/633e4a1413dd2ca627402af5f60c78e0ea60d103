iPadOS 17.7.8 comes a few days after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apple-stops-signing-ipados-17-7-7/">stopped signing iPadOS 17.7.7</a>, the prior version of iPadOS that was available on older iPads. iPadOS 17.7.7 was preventing some users from being able to log into their apps, and iPadOS 17.7.8 presumably addresses the issue.<br/>
