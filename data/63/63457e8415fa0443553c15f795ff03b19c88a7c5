<p>Listening to a familiar piano piece in the office, and I&rsquo;m thinking &ldquo;I hope this is not Mozart&rdquo; because I&rsquo;m trying to stay away from here and enjoy other composers too. It is Mozart. Concerto for Piano No. 20 KV 466. Man, I don&rsquo;t want to be <em>that</em> guy who just likes Mozart, but dude has some skills.</p>
