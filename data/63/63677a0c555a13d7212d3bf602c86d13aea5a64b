Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.4 update to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming two days after Apple released &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.4.<br/>

Registered developers can opt-in to the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
We don't yet know what's included in the macOS 15.5 update, but we are waiting on new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features. It's not clear if that functionality will be in the beta, but there isn't much else that Apple hasn't added to &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;. <br/>

Apple will soon start transitioning to macOS 16, which is set to be unveiled at WWDC in June. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-macos-sequoia-15-5/">Apple Seeds First Beta of macOS Sequoia 15.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-macos-sequoia-15-5.2454538/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
