Apple plans to turn <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> into a chatbot that will rival Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, and OpenAI's ChatGPT, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple did not initially plan to introduce a chatbot, but their popularity forced Apple executives to reconsider.<br/>

Codenamed Campos, the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot will be integrated into iOS 27, iPadOS 27, and macOS 27, replacing the current version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. It will have the same natural language conversation functionality as chatbots like ChatGPT, and it will be accessible by using the "&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;" wake word or by holding down the side button on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is testing the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot as a standalone app, but it won't be offered in app form. Instead, it will be built directly into Apple devices. Apple plans to power the chatbot with a custom model based on Google Gemini.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's chatbot will be able to search the web, generate content like images, help with coding, summarize information, and analyze uploaded files. It will be able to use personal data on a person's device to complete tasks, and it will result in a much improved search feature. Apple is also designing a feature that will let the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot view open windows and on-screen content, as well as adjust device features and settings.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will integrate into all Apple apps, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, Mail, Messages, Music, and TV, and it will be able to access and analyze content in the apps to respond to queries and requests. There will be voice and type-based interface options. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is considering how much the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot will remember. Claude and ChatGPT are able to glean information about users from past conversations for personalization purposes, but Apple may limit &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s memory for privacy purposes.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot will be an upgrade to the more personalized version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that Apple plans to roll out in iOS 26.4. With iOS 26.4, Apple will make &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; more capable, implementing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features that it initially promised in iOS 18. The much more powerful chatbot version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will follow later in the year, in iOS 27 and its sister updates.<br/>
<br/>
Apple currently plans to unveil &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, after which testing of iOS 27 will begin.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chatbot will be the key new feature in iOS 27, iPadOS 27, and macOS 27, with Apple otherwise focusing on fixing bugs and improving performance.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/siri-chatbot-ios-27/">A Siri Chatbot is Coming in iOS 27</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/a-siri-chatbot-is-coming-in-ios-27.2476402/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
