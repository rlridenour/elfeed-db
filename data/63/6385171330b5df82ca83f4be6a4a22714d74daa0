About The Emacs Cat My first attempt to dive into the ocean of Emacs occurred in 1997, more than 25 years ago.
It was an unsuccessful attempt; it now seems to me, I wasn&rsquo;t able to feel the spirit of Emacs at that time.
A second - and successful - attempt happened in 2012. Since then, I&rsquo;m trying to use Emacs for almost everything, from C++ and Python coding to my knowledge base maintenance (org-roam), and writing articles in LaTeX.
