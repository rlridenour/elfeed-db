<p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NiE3XMPrM">the Google I/O event</a> this morning. It’s shocking just how much Google has bet the company on AI. They’re even replacing search! In contrast, one of Apple&#8217;s tent poles will be a user-interface revamp. I can’t help but think Apple’s still fighting the last war while Google is gearing up for the next one. From the outside, it appears Apple is asleep.</p>



<p>Clearly, Apple has opted out of the frontier model race, and I can see why they did that. It feels far enough out of their wheelhouse that perhaps they should have passed on it. (Although what would have happened if they took the investment in the failed car and put that into AI back in the day?) </p>



<p>Where I&#8217;m baffled is Apple&#8217;s lack of embrace of AI technologies in their most important product, the iPhone. Thus far, the Apple Intelligence features seem like crude experiments compared to what Google, OpenAI, Perplexity, <em>and everyone else</em> is doing. It&#8217;s time for Apple to put down some big bets on AI for its platforms. I&#8217;ll be watching WWDC closely.</p>
