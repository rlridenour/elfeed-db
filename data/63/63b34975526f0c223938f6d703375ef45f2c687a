Earlier today, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> reported that Apple is planning to launch a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">low-cost MacBook powered by an iPhone chip</a>. The machine is expected to feature a 13-inch display, the A18 Pro chip, and color options that include silver, blue, pink, and yellow.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> can now reveal that it first spotted evidence of such a device in backend code related to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> last summer, and subsequently confirmed its use of the A18 Pro chip. The machine features the identifier "<a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1818107277846700490?s=46">Mac17,1</a>."<br/>
<br/>
This would be the first Mac powered by an ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>‌ chip. To date, all Apple silicon Macs have contained M-series chips, which offer higher core counts, support for larger amounts of memory, and better external display support. The A18 Pro chip debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> last year. <br/>
<br/>
According to Kuo, the new MacBook is expected to enter mass production late in the fourth quarter of 2025 or early in the first quarter of 2026, which situates launch in the first half of next year.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/new-macbook-with-a18-chip-spotted/">New MacBook With A18 Pro Chip Spotted in Apple Code</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-macbook-with-a18-pro-chip-spotted-in-apple-code.2459933/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
