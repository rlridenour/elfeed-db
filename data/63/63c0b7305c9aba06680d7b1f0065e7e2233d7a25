Several recent rumors have pointed to an all-new official Apple accessory arriving with the iPhone 17 lineup, and it looks like samples of the product have leaked ahead of Apple’s “Awe dropping” event on Tuesday.<br/>

Apple will offer a crossbody strap designed to work with the company's upcoming TechWoven cases for iPhone 17, and leaker Sonny Dickson has shared images of one of the straps in a <a href="https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1964898859668443336">vibrant orange color</a>. The crossbody strap will reportedly have a flexible metal core and use magnetic attachment points, allowing users to easily connect and disconnect the accessory as needed. <br/>
<br/>
Based on previous leaks, new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/techwoven-cases-crossbody-strap-rumor/">TechWoven cases</a> – replacing Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-discontinues-finewoven-cases/">discontinued</a> FineWoven line – will feature small attachment holes in the bottom corners specifically for looping through Apple's new strap. The accessory also apparently features a unique design that makes it magnetic along its entire length. <br/>
<br/>
The latest leak tallies with earlier rumors from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/iphone-17-liquid-silicone-cases-rumor/">Majin Bu</a> and fellow leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/08/iphone-17-cases-lanyard-rumor/">DuanRui</a>, who have shared CAD drawings and case clones showing similar attachment points on official iPhone 17 cases.<br/>
<br/>
It won't be the first time Apple has leaned into wearable accessories for its products. The AirPods Pro 2 charging case includes a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/08/airpods-pro-2-smaller-new-features/">lanyard cutout</a>, and the fifth-generation iPod touch featured built-in attachment hardware for similar purposes.<br/>

Apple is expected to release the iPhone 17 Pro models in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/29/iphone-17-color-dummy-models/">new orange color</a>, so the strap we see here could also be alluding to it.
