<p>Israel has adopted measures that Israeli officials and critics alike say deepen Israeli control in the occupied West Bank, including steps meant to make it easier for Jewish Israelis to buy real estate from Palestinians. Israel’s Energy Minister Eli Cohen said the package amounts to implementing “de facto sovereignty,” adding that it would set facts on the ground that leave no room for a future Palestinian state. The White House reiterated President Trump’s opposition to moves that would annex parts of the West Bank, saying U.S. policy centers on West Bank stability as part of its broader security and peace approach. The comments came after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans that would pave the way for more settlements and expand Israeli authority in areas where the Palestinian Authority currently exercises power.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/g65Adjkr_8WrP7mKxGqp-hzXyjS6J5NPIMXEaZjE7QYTwnJ3SeBICk1YkyPtHuLDuTuRx745vFEA-mBil7Qcg8xQfbuaNgQk64A19qzshHZN_BcztDV30KQT3hGAiCRJ8_fPcAAHVXBIyKFmCzyxeYCU5ntczyRSZrvWhv_d5RJ-WZnYcbQm4ZsF4d1w5mBL1SIT60nGG3aaQN69bCw8pItPWaCdnAg6dcCj9gLDgFqIGGak0v8cW1svKAAtI8cy2JRXXxmPIYyfEdo1T5jm' alt='View of the occupied West Bank amid renewed debate over annexation measures.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Rollout timing: The Guardian said Israel’s security cabinet approved the new rules on Sunday, but it was unclear when they would take effect.</li><li>Diplomacy: Semafor reported Israel’s prime minister plans to try to smooth over the dispute when he meets President Trump the next day.</li><li>Israeli framing: Cohen told Israel’s Army Radio that the steps “actually establish a fact on the ground” against a Palestinian state, using language that mirrors critics’ warnings about the measures’ intent.</li><li>Wider violence context: Semafor said more than 500 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza since October’s ceasefire, and that Israel has continued strikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.</li></ul><blockquote>A stable West Bank keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration’s goal to achieve peace in the region - White House official</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israel (Energy Minister Eli Cohen): Cohen told Israel’s Army Radio the steps amount to “de facto sovereignty” and “actually establish a fact on the ground that there will not be a Palestinian state,” echoing critics’ warnings about what the measures are designed to do.
