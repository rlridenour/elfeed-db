<p>Gunmen abducted 303 students and 12 teachers from St. Mary’s School, a Catholic institution in Niger state, with the Christian Association of Nigeria updating the total to 315 on Saturday, authorities said. It is among the worst mass school kidnappings in Nigeria in a decade and follows other abductions this week, including 25 girls in Kebbi and more than 30 worshippers in Kwara, heightening national security fears. The attacks come weeks after President Trump warned he could send U.S. forces if Christians were targeted in Nigeria.
