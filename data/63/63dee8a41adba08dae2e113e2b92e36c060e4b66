<p>OpenAI’s page for io, <em>minus</em> the “Sam and Jony” short film that introduced the partnership, is back up, with a brief announcement that the deal has officially closed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re thrilled to share that the io Products, Inc. team has
officially merged with OpenAI. Jony Ive and LoveFrom remain
independent and have assumed deep design and creative
responsibilities across OpenAI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Referring to the company as “io Products Inc.” rather than just “io” is seemingly their stopgap workaround for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/23/io-iyo-aye-aye-aye">the trademark injunction they faced from rival startup iyO two weeks ago</a>, which led them to temporarily take down this web page and the video. The video remains unavailable, presumably because of the ongoing trademark dispute.</p>
