<p>The president of the United States, yesterday on his blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>THE BIDEN FBI PLACED 274 AGENTS INTO THE CROWD ON JANUARY 6. If
this is so, which it is, a lot of very good people will be owed
big apologies. What a SCAM - DO SOMETHING!!! President DJT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No president, of course, can be expected to remember everything that happened during his four-year term. But Trump, of course, was still president on January 6, and the events that day were — to say the least — historically significant. The entire point of the January 6 insurrection — for his role in which, Trump was impeached — was to <em>prevent</em> Joe Biden from becoming president on January 20.</p>

<p>The man is obviously unwell.</p>
