Apple is testing new Purple and Green color options for the iPhone 17 base model, according to new information shared by a leaker known as <a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1936061526147776765">Majin Bu</a>.<br/>

In a <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/phone-17-new-purple-and-green-colors-in-testing-for-base-models/">blog post</a> today, Majin Bu said that only one of the two new colors might make the final cut, with Purple apparently being the more likely choice.<br/>
<br/>
The base model iPhone 16 is available in five colors: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, and Black.<br/>
<br/>
Majin Bu has a mixed track record with Apple rumors. Most recently, they accurately leaked that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ipados-19-mac-like-menu-bar-rumor/">iPadOS 26 would add a Mac-like menu bar to the iPad</a>, but they incorrectly claimed that iOS 26 would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ios-19-iphone-stage-manager-rumor/">add Stage Manager to iPhone models with a USB-C port</a>.<br/>

<h2>iPhone 17: Other Rumors</h2><br/>
In a research note with equity research firm GF Securities last month, Apple analyst Jeff Pu said that the iPhone 17 base model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/iphone-17-rumored-a18-chip-8gb-ram/">will be equipped with the A18 chip</a> that is used in the iPhone 16 base model. The chip will continue to be manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, known as N3E, he said.<br/>
<br/>
Pu also expects the entry-level iPhone 17 to have 8GB of RAM, matching the iPhone 16.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the base iPhone 17 is shaping up to be a minor upgrade over the equivalent iPhone 16, with both devices expected to have the same overall design. Key new features that are rumored for the iPhone 17 include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-17-and-17-air-120hz-promotion-rumor/">120Hz display</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-more/">24-megapixel front camera</a>, compared to 60Hz and a 12-megapixel front camera on the iPhone 16.<br/>
<br/>
The base iPhone 17 will also feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/iphone-17-display-sizes/">slightly larger 6.3-inch display</a> compared to the 6.1-inch iPhone 16, according to display industry expert Ross Young.<br/>
