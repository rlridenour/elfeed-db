<p>Just in time for being stuck inside with family for the holidays.</p>

<p>Party games for when Cards Against Humanity is old hat but no one wants to power on Jackbox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two comments provide the perfect foundation for our sales pitch today.</p>
<p>The first one is just a basic fact: now is a great time to load up on some easy-to-play games as you spend more time inside with your family. If anything, we offer these today because, if you missed them the last few times, you now have experienced Thanksgiving without them. Therefore, you might be more inclined to buy with the very real experience of family time fresh in your mind and the forecast calling for a lot more in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>And so, with the idea of playing these games with your family, consider this second comment about Jackbox.</p>
<p>The last time we sold these, we contrasted the games in this bundle to an over-complicated fictional tabletop game called MainFrame. The point was, with things like this, you want to aim low in terms of difficulty and complexity, even if your opponents claim to be huge board/card game fans. Because, well, everyone’s experience of something is relative.</p>
<p>You’ve had this happen, right? You meet another avowed “coffee snob,” and you’re all ready to discuss the merits of brewing single-origin beans in an Aeropress versus a Chemex, when they reveal that their definition of snobbery involves turning up their nose at Dunkin in favor of Starbucks. Or a coworker calls themselves a “film buff,” which excites you because you’ll finally have a conversation partner with whom to discuss some artistic movement in Spanish cinema from the late 1980s, only to learn this person just, like, watches a lot of movies. (Or else it goes the other way; you claim an interest and then come to realize how shallow said interest actually runs in comparison to a true devotee.)</p>
<p>Well, there’s something else that’s variable: tech literacy.</p>
<p>You might interact with older relatives on Facebook and think, <em>Hey, they get it.</em> But then you go home for the holidays and you find their browsers laden with “toolbars” and their homepage has somehow become a sketchy online casino. And when you ask why, they shrug and say, “It said it had to be changed.”</p>
<p>For a family member like that, something as simple as Jackbox will be way too difficult.</p>
<p>So bring some card games. Like these. They’re fun. We promise. (Or, well, we don’t promise that. Because fun is another thing that’s relative.)</p>
