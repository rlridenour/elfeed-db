<p>President Trump said he will begin working to end Sudan’s civil war after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked him to intervene, calling the fighting &quot;tremendous atrocities&quot; and saying the issue had been &quot;not on my charts&quot; until the request. Trump made the pledge during a Washington business forum and following a White House meeting with the crown prince, and said the United States would seek to stabilise the conflict in coordination with regional partners such as the United Arab Emirates. The Sudan conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly 12 million people since it began in April 2023, a humanitarian crisis the U.N. and aid groups have repeatedly urged the world to address.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/w880Ls3QpUg4sfl1_AwIyhhPCTZvvaotqzoWZfr25U5GKviKEKPXSGTTwqnQL8yACEENS6rveMXSt1BLYOl7W5uVjOg35suG-enLVZRzH-pyLDjPil_yXLnc49s2sGIHqI9YdjFMre1NYj6yOXqneZncsG1sWDGOoGLHRljBNSy92AvNr_OXn7W0m2PANVnbnZPY_q3_wavIJg' alt='President Trump hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House during the Washington visit' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Saudi investment: Saudi officials used the Washington visit to boost planned U.S. investment promises from $600 billion to about $1 trillion across sectors including AI, critical minerals and nuclear energy</li><li>Regional partners: Trump said he would coordinate with regional powers to stabilise Sudan, a process that references the UAE’s role even as Gulf states deny arming the paramilitary RSF</li><li>Human rights shift: Observers say the U.S. welcome for Mohammed bin Salman and Trump’s defense of the crown prince signal a broader shift in Washington’s public posture on human rights</li><li>F-35 sale limits: The F-35 jets the U.S. plans to sell Saudi Arabia will omit some advanced modifications that Israel’s fleet carries, consistent with U.S. law protecting Israel’s qualitative military edge</li></ul><blockquote>His majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: I will use the influence of the presidency to bring an immediate halt to the tremendous atrocities taking place in Sudan and start working on the issue after the crown prince’s request.
