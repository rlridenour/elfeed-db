<p>The Trump administration says it has reached a deal with Venezuela’s transitional government under which oil revenues would be routed through a Qatar-based fund and released as a monthly “budget” that the United States would review and approve. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the arrangement to the Senate as a “novel” mechanism aimed at controlling how a portion of Venezuela’s national income is spent, while allowing the country to keep functioning financially. Rubio told senators the US sees “significant progress” in Venezuela since the removal of Nicolás Maduro and the establishment of a transitional government, citing steps such as lifting restrictions on foreign investment in the oil sector. Supporters present the plan as a way to add accountability and encourage economic reopening; critics in the coverage frame it as Washington tightening its grip over Venezuelan decision-making.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lfWyc5VLHhADmJQUKOmZ1utFWdtwtP_UIqUzjtHq2oshtV_L0zan8X-TvBv0uO7daMmSQGvC36Wh0zkbIocrGPAntDCI8GXhiBBCTDpGhI_blvuCLKZGP1WvIWFd-zEDhR_blIlT07305LoiPoTjJI5lrau5eTHd4wPW4tAknr6GYbfrn15v5tSNk3T8lOqrZ1OFThI-x5JvaJkQ1sCLZWFMWQ49php86cMPLn7PMQCYCCsrzR-6p_T5PQ' alt='US Secretary of State Marco Rubio appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington, January 28, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Senate testimony: Rubio presented the plan during an appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington.</li><li>Oil investment rules: Rubio said the transitional government has lifted limits on foreign investment in Venezuela’s oil sector, which the US cites as evidence of policy change.</li><li>Control mechanism: The arrangement would channel oil proceeds through a Qatar fund, with the US determining what Caracas can spend from the monthly allocation.</li><li>Pressure narrative: In testimony summarized by Firstpost, Rubio said the interim government agreed to the monthly submission as the US seeks greater leverage over Venezuela’s finances.</li></ul><blockquote>Significant progress - Marco Rubio</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US State Department (Marco Rubio): Rubio told senators the US has seen “significant progress” in Venezuela under the transitional government and defended the monthly-budget review concept.
