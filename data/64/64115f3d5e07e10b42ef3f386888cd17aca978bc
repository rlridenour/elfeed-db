<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Dredging up a post I wrote over new years, but figuring I&rsquo;d release it into the world.

<p><small>I wrote this <time datetime="2025-01-01" title="2025-01-01">New Year’s Day</time> but failed to send it forward.</small></p>

<p>A New Year’s eve tradition I started <time datetime="2024-12-31" title="2024-12-31">yesterday</time> is watching the first episode of
<cite data-id="943173CC-E080-4A08-B921-307EDD26BAB4">Futurama</cite>; one which happens in both the <time datetime="2000" title="2000">2000</time> and <time datetime="3000" title="3000">3000</time> new year.</p>
<p>I didn’t stay up to usher in the <time datetime="2025-01-01" title="2025-01-01">new year</time>.  And at this stage in life, for New
Years Eve antics, I channel Professor Farnsworth’s sentiment: I could go out
“though I am already in my pajamas.”</p>
<h2 id="plans">Plans</h2>
<p>A key priority: <strong>guard my capacity for attention and empathy</strong>.  I’m assuming that
the attacks on attention and empathy will continue to escalate.</p>
<h3 id="reading-more">Reading More</h3>
<p>I finished 17 books, abandoned 2, and started 8 books <time datetime="2024" title="2024">last year</time>.  Which is less
than I’d like.  However, I must give myself grace, as <time datetime="2024" title="2024">last year</time> I moved twice
and changed jobs.  Three high stress personal events; plus the malaise of the
<time datetime="2024" title="2024">2024</time> political “discourse.”</p>
<p>I consider myself a rather broad reader; reading from most any genre and era.
My “process” of picking a book involves serendipity and recommendations.</p>
<p>I follow a few readers and writers; The Marginalian has drawn my attention to
many books.  When reading non-fiction, I note references to other books, and add
them to my “keep an eye out for these books.”  At book stores, I peruse most
sections stumbling upon curiosities.</p>
<p>In years past, I looked to Appendix N, and now look to other book indices
created by authors and readers.</p>
<p>I also have weekly dinner and drinks with a group of friends.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> The Dam Nerd Club as we’ve named ourselves.  We met at a brewery near a dam.
A Dam Run Club has been meeting there for 8 years.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
 We talk about
books, software, music, hardware, historic architecture, and most anything else.
Our group’s reading interests are varied, which is fantastic for sharing.</p>
<p>Were I to start a book club, it would be of the “bring a book you want to share”
format.  And it could even be “I started this book but am struggling and here’s
why…”</p>
<h3 id="writing-more">Writing More</h3>
<p><time datetime="2024" title="2024">Last year</time> I wrote 121 blog posts.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> See <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2024/">my Posts for 2024</a>.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
 But I also privately wrote more: daily
private journal entries and hand written letters.  I did this by prioritizing
morning writing; done before I started my day’s job.</p>
<p>And I’m going to work to strengthen and reinforce this habit.  Meaning I’ll be
attending to improving my note taking and capture process.</p>
<h3 id="growing-our-own-food">Growing Our Own Food</h3>
<p>At our new house, I’m looking to install two raised beds and grow some yummy
vegetables.  We’re considering getting some chickens, however with the bird flu
rising, I’m reconsidering (or thinking about mitigation).</p>
<p>I dream again of being able to harvest a few fresh herbs and vegetables for my
cooking: onions, cilantro, sage, rosemary, thyme, peppers, beans, and squash.</p>
<h3 id="diving-deeper-into-foss">Diving Deeper into FOSS</h3>
<p>I’ve had access to a home computer since <time datetime="1984" title="1984">1984</time>.  But never explored the gritty
details; instead focusing on software.</p>
<p>For <time datetime="2024-12-25" title="2024-12-25">Christmas</time> I got a <a href="https://libre.computer/products/aml-s905x-cc/">Sweet Potato</a> with the plans of building a <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole server</a>
for my home network.  I installed <span><a href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Debian”" title="Other site-wide references of “Debian”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-DEBIAN">&#128214;</a></small>
, and as a curiosity also installed the
<a href="https://www.gnome.org/">Gnome desktop</a>.  From that little machine I felt comfortable that it had all I
needed/want: <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
 and Web Browser.</p>
<p>I have access to several older computers and am thinking about re-purposing them
to create a fleet of Linux machines that I can share with others.</p>
<h3 id="talking-and-sharing-more">Talking and Sharing More</h3>
<p>We are wrapping up renovations on our new house and will be moving back in <time datetime="2025-01" title="2025-01">early
January</time>.  We’ll be reaching out to get to know our neighbors, for community and
resource sharing.</p>
<p>I’m considering hosting “a read aloud around the campfire” evenings.  Our house
is on a small lake and the yard is framed by several massive gnarled white oaks.
I imagine a serene evening of reading aloud epic poetry; sharing fellowship,
drinks, and snacks.</p>
<h2 id="where-i-m-at">Where I’m At?</h2>
<p><time datetime="2025-04-12" title="2025-04-12">Today</time> I’m revisiting my draft blog posts, and this one I think is worthy of
bubbling up.</p>
<p>How am I doing at reading more?  I’ve finished 16 books, some that I started in
<time datetime="2024" title="2024">2024</time>.  I’m in a bit of a lull on my reading, having been bitten by the <span>Emacs</span>

bug.</p>
<p>I am midway through <cite data-id="87f4018e-a675-44a7-9c95-b1183384affd">The Dispossessed</cite> by Ursula K. Le Guin and <cite data-id="d334ef0c-4398-479f-ad82-4d8b9e993d2c">The Trial</cite> by Franz Kafka.</p>
<p>And writing more?  With this blog post I’ll be at 38 <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/">posts for the year</a>.  My
daily journal is at about 40,000 words.  Hitting on the virtuous cycle of
reading and writing.</p>
<p>What about growing our own food?  <time datetime="2024" title="2024">Last year</time> we needed to remove two massive
trees.  We had the tree service mulch many of the branches, leaving us with
about 10 yards of local mulch.</p>
<p>And <time datetime="2025-04-12" title="2025-04-12">today</time> we laid down 4 raised beds (though we need more), and started
identifying where to plant berries and fruit bearing trees.  We have the seeds,
some from a seed library hosted by our local library.  We also found a possible
source for chicks and are considering raising chickens to have both eggs and
excellent fertilizing.</p>
<p>What about diving deeper into <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free Open Source Software</a></span> (<abbr title="Free Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Free Open Source Software”" title="Other site-wide references of “Free Open Source Software”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-FOSS">&#128214;</a></small>)
?  I’ve repurposed an older iMac, installing
<span>Debian</span>
 and <span>Emacs</span>
, with the goal of having an air-gapped machine on which I can
write without temptation of internet distraction.</p>
<p>And talking and sharing more?  We moved into our renovated home and are talking
with our neighbors; sharing plants and concerns.  The stakes feel high, and the
system wants snap responses; so slowing down into the analogue and immediate
world is far more sustainable.</p>
