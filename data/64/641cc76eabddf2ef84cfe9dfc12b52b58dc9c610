The software updates can be downloaded through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. <br/>
<br/>
tvOS 26 adopts new Liquid Glass design changes inspired by visionOS, much like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> and macOS 26. The update also includes support for karaoke using an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as a microphone, improvements for using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> speakers with a TV, new Aerial screen savers, and quicker logins to apps at setup thanks to Apple Account syncing.<br/>
<br/>
The beta is limited to developers right now, but tvOS 26 will be available to public beta testers in the near future ahead of its fall launch.<br/>
