<p>Clyde Haberman, The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saul Zabar, who across more than seven decades as a principal
owner of the Upper West Side food emporium bearing his family name
kept New Yorkers amply fortified with smoked fish, earthy bread
and tangy cheese, not to mention pungent coffee, died on Tuesday
in Manhattan. He was 97. [...]</p>

<p>What did he look for in a fish? His response to The New York Sun
in 2007 was worthy of a cryptic Zen master: “It’s got to have
taste. Not too this, not too that.”</p>

<p>But he was clear about his store’s iconic status. “There’s a
romance about what we do,” he said in 2012. “We have a modern
appearance, but we really do things the way they were done 40, 50,
75, even 200 years ago.” [...]</p>

<p>“We get asked often why we don’t franchise, because we have a lot
of branded products,” <a href="https://www.ediblemanhattan.com/tastemakers/the_brothers_zabar">he told the magazine Edible Manhattan in
2022</a>.</p>

<p>“Money is not why we do this, not why we’re here seven days a
week,” he said. “It’s a way of life for us. It’s kind of
old-fashioned.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people claim that they’re not in it for the money. Only some of them mean it. And those are the most interesting, and often most beloved, people in the world.</p>
