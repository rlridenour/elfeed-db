Apple is planning to debut a high-end secondary version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> this year, sitting in the lineup alongside the current model, reports suggest.<br/>

Back in September 2025, supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/07/airpods-pro-3-this-year-per-kuo/">reported</a> that Apple is planning to introduce a successor to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; in 2026. This would be somewhat unusual since Apple normally waits around three years to make major changes to the AirPods' hardware. AirPods Pro 2 debuted at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14 event in September 2022, and they were updated with a USB-C charging case and a few other tweaks in September 2023. Otherwise, Apple has waited about three years to update all of its AirPods models. <br/>
<br/>
Kuo said that the 2026 AirPods Pro will feature a "more significant" hardware upgrade in the form at least one <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/apple-still-exploring-airpods-with-cameras/">tiny infrared camera</a>. He previously said AirPods with infrared cameras could recognize hand gestures and provide an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/">enhanced spatial audio experience</a> with Apple's Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
The Chinese leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>" subsequently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/08/two-versions-of-airpods-pro-3-coming/">corroborated the rumor</a> with some additional details and clarifications. Rather than being a new generation, the 2026 AirPods Pro will apparently be a pricier, high-end variant of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; introduced in 2025, suggesting that both models will ultimately be on sale alongside each other. It is worth noting that Apple offers two version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> at &#36;129 and &#36;179 price points, so this is a highly plausible move.<br/>
<br/>
The current AirPods lineup has offerings priced at &#36;129, &#36;179, &#36;249, and &#36;549. An additional product between the &#36;249 &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; and &#36;549 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> seems possible, especially given the rise of higher end Bluetooth earbuds from the likes of Bang Olufsen, Bowers & Wilkins, and Bose.<br/>
<br/>
As Kuo first said, Instant Digital similarly believes that the key differentiator will be an infrared camera for gesture controls. In fact, Apple may remove the high-end model's pressure-sensors and go all-in on gesture controls.<br/>
<br/>
The H3 chip is also a possibility. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, the next-generation audio chip is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/12/new-airpods-pro-airpods-5-h3-chip-rumors/">in development</a>. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; launched last year stuck with the same H2 chip from their predecessor released in 2022. <br/>
<br/>
Launch timing is currently unclear, but Apple typically announces new AirPods in the second half of the year. The original AirPods, AirPods Pro 2 and their subsequent USB-C revision, &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj;, and &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; were all announced at Apple's annual &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; event in September. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/higher-end-airpods-pro-coming-this-year/">New, Higher End AirPods Pro Coming This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-higher-end-airpods-pro-coming-this-year.2476347/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
