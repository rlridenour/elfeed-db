An <a href="https://www.fanpage.it/politica/sono-il-secondo-giornalista-di-fanpage-ad-essere-stato-spiato-e-ancora-non-so-da-chi-ne-perche/">Italian journalist</a> and a <a href="https://x.com/EvaVlaar/status/1917529857560289751/photo/1">Dutch activist</a> said that they received notifications from Apple via iMessage and email.<br/>

<blockquote>Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple Account. This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it's never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning - please take it seriously.</blockquote><br/>
Apple said in its message that the notification was being sent to targeted users in 100 countries, and the company advised that those receiving the alert enable Lockdown Mode and ensure that their iPhones are updated to iOS 18.4.1. Apple also warned against opening links or attachments from unexpected or unknown senders.<br/>
<blockquote>We are unable to provide more information about what caused us to send you this notification, as that may help mercenary spyware attacker adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future. Apple threat notifications like this one will never ask you to click any links, install an app or profile, or provide your Apple Account password or verification code by email or over the phone.</blockquote><br/>
Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/apple-warns-users-mercenary-spyware-attacks/">sending out notices</a> like this to those targeted in state-sponsored attacks since 2021. Many state-sponsored surveillance campaigns use the Pegasus spyware from NSO Group, and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/23/apple-state-sponsored-spyware-threat-notifications/">launched a lawsuit against NSO Group</a> in 2021.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102174">a support document</a> on Apple's threat notification policy, Apple sends out alerts multiple times per year when attacks are detected, and to date, users in over 150 countries have been notified about potential attacks.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/">Apple Security</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-warnings-spyware-attacks/">Apple Warns More Users About Mercenary Spyware Attacks</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-warns-more-users-about-mercenary-spyware-attacks.2456253/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
