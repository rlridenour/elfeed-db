There are times that I need to open many web pages of some specific websites within a browser, and there are so many tabs that I can&#39;t efficiently access one of them, as their favicons are all the same.</p>
<p>
So I tried to find a way to rename their titles, preferably in a lightweight way, so that I can spot them quickly with my eyes.</p>
<p>
The first thought came into my mind was to find some browser extensions to do the job. It was easy to install one with no time. But I was not very happy with the experience. It seems that it keeps the rule of renaming titles based on the URL so that the title will always be renamed if I refreshing it, which is not what I want. I&#39;d rather want to do it in an ad-hoc way.</p>
