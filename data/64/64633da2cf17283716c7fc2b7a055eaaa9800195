<p>The BBC&#x27;s director‑general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness resigned on Sunday amid uproar over a Panorama documentary that critics say misleadingly edited parts of President Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, speech. The departures followed the leak of an internal memo from a former BBC standards adviser that raised broader impartiality concerns in coverage of the Israel–Gaza war, transgender issues and the Trump episode. Davie said the decision was his and that he would remain in post while a successor is found; the resignations prompted public comment from the White House and were welcomed by President Trump and his press team.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/2PbGg1pAETO_dIvjxZiNNJtuHEj09mx8oKsUr5fR83RqbOdfZH2lKz6mEVjIf0msB2PP3B0kLmF_11PIQUJ-Y2SmBV2L00Kn9UupmdKC2Fa6nyQL5Sd-xlzDk_PBw2F4Wp1Y8-DQcS-AkBNcXlUZovbpiYZrUtrzt97dwkeb6S_W6lShCMP6q2WYEJi9RyE9ZGxykvpKWrEdidRwocDXsz0Bcy-G120NONUtnptXJkmAU0x3u69JZJZ4fgza3CCOrI_caDBRe1iZ4MVMgA' alt='Tim Davie in 2022; the BBC director-general resigned Sunday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Memo details: The leaked note was authored by former standards adviser Michael Prescott and accused Panorama of splicing remarks made roughly 54 minutes apart so Mr. Trump appeared to encourage the Jan. 6 crowd.</li><li>Broader failings: The memo listed a series of editorial failings beyond the Trump clip, citing coverage of the Gaza war and transgender issues as evidence of systemic impartiality concerns.</li><li>Government reaction: The UK culture, media and sport minister described the allegations as &#x27;incredibly serious,&#x27; increasing pressure for an official response from the BBC and ministers.</li><li>Chair response: The BBC chair, Samir Shah, is expected to apologise publicly for the way the Trump speech was presented, according to reporting on the board&#x27;s next steps.</li></ul><blockquote>This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the Chair and Board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days. - Tim Davie</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Tim Davie (BBC director‑general): Davie said the decision to leave was his and expressed thanks to the chair and board while noting the personal and professional demands of the role.
