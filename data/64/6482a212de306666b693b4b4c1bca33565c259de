Apple's next-generation iPhone 18, iPhone 18 Pro, and iPhone 18 Pro Max models will be equipped with a slightly smaller Dynamic Island, but the devices will not feature under-screen Face ID, according to the <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Q4niosSS2">Weibo account Instant Digital</a>.<br/>

There were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/iphone-17-metalens-rumor/">conflicting rumors</a> about whether the iPhone 17 Pro models would have a smaller Dynamic Island, but its size did not change. Now, the rumor is back on the table for the iPhone 18 series, and there is a decent chance it will be true this time around, as it would be a stepping stone towards the rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/11/apple-iphone-air-interview/">20th-anniversary all-glass iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Under-screen Face ID has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/20/kuo-2024-iphone-under-screen-face-id-camera/">rumored for the iPhone 16 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/">iPhone 18 Pro models</a>, so it feels like one of those features that is always a year or two away. Indeed, if the latest information shared by Instant Digital is accurate, under-screen Face ID will not debut until the iPhone 19 Pro models or later. The cycle repeats.<br/>
<br/>
None of the iPhone 18 models will feature an under-screen front camera, the account added. Instead, the devices will have a smaller Dynamic Island and a visible front camera, according to the information they shared on Weibo today. <br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital has around 1.5 million followers on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform. The account has accurately leaked information about future Apple products in the past, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/iphone-17-pro-advanced-cooling-better-performance/">iPhone 17 Pro models featuring a vapor chamber cooling system</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">Yellow finish for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-introduce-redesigned-milanese-loop/">Apple Watch Ultra 2's Titanium Milanese Loop</a>. However, the account does not have a perfect track record, and some of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/liquid-glass-iphone-17-pro-color-ios-26-design/">other iPhone 17 rumors</a> it shared in recent months did not materialize.<br/>

We are still a year away from the iPhone 18 series, so buckle up, as there will be plenty more rumors about the devices to come.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/iphone-18-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/">New iPhone 18 and iPhone 18 Pro Rumors: Smaller Dynamic Island, No Under-Screen Face ID</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-18-and-iphone-18-pro-rumors-smaller-dynamic-island-no-under-screen-face-id.2465665/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
