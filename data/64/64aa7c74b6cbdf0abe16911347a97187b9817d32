<p>I am trying to stay away from things like this usually, but it&rsquo;s getting weird to use a yellow thumbs up at work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m white, and I&rsquo;m used to using the yellow ones. More and more folks I chat with at work use different skin tones, usually black or brown. I understand why, and it makes sence. But then, when it comes to me&hellip; if I use a yellow one, it might show that I&rsquo;m just ignorant or don&rsquo;t care, and I don&rsquo;t want to offend someone this way&hellip; on the other hand, using a white emoji is&hellip; not much better, is it.</p>
