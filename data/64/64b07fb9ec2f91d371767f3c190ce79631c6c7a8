I struggled with ox-rss for my blog feed and really could never get it working. It would generate an RSS file, but for some reason, the feed readers wouldn’t get anything. I don’t know enough about XML to fix it, and I had neither the time right now nor the inclination to learn.
</p>

 <p>
So, I stumbled across  <a href="https://github.com/emacsmirror/webfeeder">Emacs Webfeeder</a>, which creates a feed from the HTML files. After adding it with use-package, I removed the RSS component of my  <code>publish.el</code> file, and changed by blog build function to this:
</p>

 <div class="org-src-container">
 <pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">( <span class="org-keyword">defun</span>  <span class="org-function-name">orgblog-build</span> ()
  ( <span class="org-keyword">interactive</span>)
  ( <span class="org-keyword">progn</span>
    (find-file  <span class="org-string">"~/sites/orgblog/publish.el"</span>)
    (eval-buffer)
    (org-publish-all)
    (webfeeder-build  <span class="org-string">"atom.xml"</span>
                        <span class="org-string">"./docs"</span>
                        <span class="org-string">"https://randyridenour.net/"</span>
                       ( <span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((default-directory (expand-file-name  <span class="org-string">"./docs"</span>)))
                         (remove  <span class="org-string">"posts/index.html"</span>
                                 (directory-files-recursively  <span class="org-string">"posts"</span>
                                                               <span class="org-string">".*\\.html$"</span>)))
                        <span class="org-builtin">:title</span>  <span class="org-string">"Randy Ridenour"</span>
                        <span class="org-builtin">:description</span>  <span class="org-string">"Blog posts by Randy Ridenour"</span>)
    (kill-buffer))
  (message  <span class="org-string">"Build complete!"</span>))
</pre>
</div>


 <p>
After building the site, Webfeeder generated an  <code>atom.rss</code> file, and everything works fine. That was the last critical component of my endeavor to blog with Emacs only.
