</ul><h1>Clean Your Car</h1><p>Hey, it’s time to clean your car. And we’ve got some good news and some bad news and then some more good news.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the first bit of good news.</p>
<p>“Clean” is a relative term when it comes to automobiles. While many refer to them as two motorcycles with a little house in the middle, the truth is, they’re more like mudrooms on wheels. By which we mean: you’re aiming more for order than absolute cleanliness.</p>
<p>When it comes to a “clean” mudroom, you just need to make sure the shoes are in order, the floor is swept, the welcome mat in place. Nobody’s doing the white glove test in there. Same goes for your car. You need to make sure there aren’t too many crumbs gathering in the contours of the seat, or that the dashboard isn’t so dusty you can’t read the speedometer, or that there aren’t composting leaf bits all over the floor.</p>
<p>And now, onto the bad news.</p>
<p>Despite clean being graded on a curve for your car, it still sucks to actually, you know, clean it. Because–and here is a way your car is distinctly not like a mud room–it isn’t just a big cube of space where everything can be shifted this way and that to make it easier to tidy up. Every car is a collection of crevices and awkward angles.</p>
<p>And don’t get us started on the expanse between your dashboard and your windshield. Sure, engineers probably make cars shaped that way for a reason, but holy shit, the result is a veritable dust farm that you have to stare at if you want to keep your eyes on the road.</p>
<p>Annoying, right?</p>
<p>Okay, now, for some more good news.</p>
<p>This little vacuum.</p>
<p>That’s the good news.</p>
<p>It looks like a hair dryer or a percussion massager but packs some solid suction and comes with a whole slew of attachments. But mostly, the benefit is that it’s small and handheld. So you can get anywhere. Because, after all, your $1500 Sebo’s not super helpful if you can’t maneuver it to suck up the dirt under the passenger seat.</p>
<p>So get a little vacuum. And clean your car. (Or your house. You can use it anywhere, really.)</p>
