<p>In 1647, Venetian inventor Tito Livio Burattini built a flying machine that could carry a cat. Reportedly the vessel had four pairs of wings and was driven by cords pulled by hand; it &#8220;remained airborne as long as a man kept the feathers and wheels in motion by the way of a string.&#8221; One observer wrote, &#8220;if the cat had the understanding to do that &#8212; its strength would be sufficient for this &#8212; it would keep itself in the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>This 4-foot &#8220;<em>Dragon Volant</em>&#8221; was only a prototype; Burattini hoped to produce a finished version that could carry a man. By May 1648 he&#8217;d brought out an improved model, and German polymath Johann Joachim Becher even mentions a report that the aircraft eventually rose into the air with three people aboard, including the inventor, who &#8220;wanted to fly from Warsaw to Constantinople inside 12 hours.&#8221; But &#8220;as there were always some shortcomings, perfection was never achieved,&#8221; and it appears the project ended there.</p>
