Apple last month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">announced the launch of CarPlay Ultra</a>, the long-awaited next-generation version of its CarPlay software system for vehicles.<br/>

There was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/25/car-brands-reneged-on-apple-carplay-ultra/">news this week</a> about which automakers will and won't offer CarPlay Ultra, and we have provided an updated list below.<br/>
<br/>
CarPlay Ultra is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/first-look-at-carplay-ultra/">limited to newer Aston Martin vehicles</a> in the U.S. and Canada. Fortunately, if you cannot afford a &#36;250,000 luxury vehicle, the software system will eventually be available in more affordable vehicles.<br/>

Apple said "many" other automakers around the world plan to offer CarPlay Ultra over the next year and beyond, including Korean brands Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, Porsche also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/25/porsche-reaffirms-carplay-ultra-plans/">reaffirmed its commitment to CarPlay Ultra</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first previewed the next generation ‌of CarPlay‌ all the way back at WWDC 2022, and at the time it shared a long list of automakers that were committed to offering the software system. The list is more than three years old, and it is not entirely accurate anymore.<br/>
<br/>
The list was as follows:<ul><li>Acura</li><br/>
<li>Audi</li><br/>
<li>Ford</li><br/>
<li>Honda</li><br/>
<li>Infiniti</li><br/>
<li>Jaguar</li><br/>
<li>Land Rover</li><br/>
<li>Lincoln</li><br/>
<li>Mercedes-Benz</li><br/>
<li>Nissan</li><br/>
<li>Polestar</li><br/>
<li>Porsche</li><br/>
<li>Renault</li><br/>
<li>Volvo</li></ul>According to a report this week from the <em>Financial Times</em>, there are at least five automakers on that list that have since confirmed that they have no plans to offer CarPlay Ultra, including Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Renault, and Volvo.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, here is where things stand currently.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Currently Offers CarPlay Ultra</h2><ul><li>Aston Martin</li></ul><h2>Will Offer CarPlay Ultra</h2><ul><li>Hyundai</li><br/>
<li>Kia</li><br/>
<li>Genesis</li><br/>
<li>Porsche</li></ul><h2>Won't Offer CarPlay Ultra</h2><ul><li>Audi</li><br/>
<li>BMW</li><br/>
<li>Mercedes-Benz</li><br/>
<li>Polestar</li><br/>
<li>Renault</li><br/>
<li>Volvo</li></ul>General Motors controversially ditched the regular version of CarPlay <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/gm-further-explains-phasing-out-carplay/">in its new electric vehicles</a>, so it is likely to pass on CarPlay Ultra too. That means vehicles from brands like Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC are unlikely to offer CarPlay Ultra.<br/>
