Apple is one of several tech companies that will contribute to the construction of U.S. President Donald Trump's 90,000-square-foot ballroom, reports <em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/ballroom-donors-white-house-trump">CNN</a></em>.<br/>

Construction began on the ballroom this week, and the White House's east wing was torn down. Trump claims that the ballroom will cost &#36;350 million, and that it will be privately funded through donations. The cost has already increased &#36;150 million over the figures that Trump previously quoted.<br/>
<br/>
Other tech companies that have donated to the ballroom construction include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and HP.<br/>
<br/>
There is no word on the specific amount that Apple donated toward the project.<br/>
