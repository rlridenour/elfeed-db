<p>Someone watched it recently - I think it was <a href="https://brandons-journal.com">Brandon</a> - and I thought, hey, I&rsquo;m in the mood for some Keano. What a rush of a movie, the adrenaline doesn&rsquo;t stop. I wish Sandra Bullock would get more credit for this movie, she was excellent as well.</p>
