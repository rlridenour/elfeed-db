<p>According to the <em>Guardian</em> (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8wAWAAAAYAAJ&#038;pg=RA1-PA99">March 1872</a>), Lord Palmerston once dictated this sentence to 11 British cabinet ministers, &#8220;not one of whom, it is said, spelled it correctly&#8221;:</p>
<p><em>It is disagreeable to witness the embarrassment of a harassed peddler gauging the symmetry of a peeled potato.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;And Lord R. Cecil, in the House of Commons, some time ago, quoted the following lines which he said were given as a dictation exercise by an assistant commissioner to the children of a school in Ipswich&#8221;:</p>
<p>While hewing yew, Hugh lost his ewe,<br />
And put it in the <em>Hue and Cry</em>,<br />
To name its face&#8217;s dusky hues<br />
Was all the effort he could use.<br />
You brought the ewe back, by-and-by,<br />
And only begged the hewer&#8217;s ewer,<br />
Your hands to wash in water pure,<br />
Lest nice-nosed ladies, not a few,<br />
Should cry, on coming near you, &#8220;Ugh!&#8221;</p>
