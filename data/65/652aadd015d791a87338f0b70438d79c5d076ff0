Chipolo today introduced a series of new Bluetooth-enabled item trackers that are compatible with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> network. Called <a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-pop">the Pop</a>, these trackers come in a range of bright colors, including blue, yellow, red, and green, along with black and white.<br/>

The Chipolo Pop item trackers work with Apple &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, so you can use them just like AirTags. The Pop can be added to your Items tab in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, and once added, it is trackable over Bluetooth and can be placed on an item like a bag or a suitcase for tracking purposes.<br/>

When the item is out of range, the Pop is able to connect to the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network to leverage the iPhones of other people to locate your item and relay its location.<br/>
<br/>
Like an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a>, the Chipolo Pop is equipped with a CR2032 battery that lasts for up to a year before it needs to be replaced. The Pop is 6.6mm thick (so a little thinner than an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj;) and it has a 300 ft range, plus it comes with a loop at the top for attaching a keyring or strap.<br/>

Compared to prior-generation Chipolo trackers, the Pop has a louder sound when the Play Sound option is selected in &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, a longer range, and IP55 dust and water resistance.<br/>

Chipolo is selling the Pop for &#36;29, and it can be purchased from the Chipolo website. Four Pops are priced at &#36;89, and six Pops are priced at &#36;121, or a little over &#36;20 per tracker.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/chipolo-pop-tracker/">Chipolo Launches Colorful New &#039;Pop&#039; Trackers Compatible With Find My</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chipolo-launches-colorful-new-pop-trackers-compatible-with-find-my.2455321/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
