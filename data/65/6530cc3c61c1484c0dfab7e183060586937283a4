<p>How does <em>The Australian </em>create its list of top researchers? Here&#8217;s their methodology:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We give every Australian researcher and every Australian university or research organisation an impact score in each of 250 fields of research. This score is equal to the number of citations for papers published (by the individual or the institution) in the top 20 journals of each particular field in the past five years. The researcher and the institution with the top score is the leader of the field. This approach ensures that only quality work, and recent work, is considered. We use publicly available information on Google Scholar to identify researchers, to obtain data on their citations and to link their work with universities and research institutions.</em></p>
