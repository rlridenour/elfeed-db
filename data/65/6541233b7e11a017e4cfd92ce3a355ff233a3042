    In this <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/01/pinocchio-problem.html">old essay by Steve Yegge</a>, he has a nice <i>synthesis</i> of static
    vs dynamic types, but also includes lots of interesting observations
    on Emacs (one would have to, since <i>static vs. dynamic</i> is almost as
    old a debate as <i>emacs vs. vi</i>). I liked this quote:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>
    People have observed that Emacs has QWAN<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>: a nice, organic,
    comfortable rightness that fits like a pair of old jeans, or a snug
    warm chair in a library by a fire. It's very right-brain stuff we're
    talking about here, all touchy and feely and sensitive: exactly the
    kind of thing that programmers are often so lousy at, so it's no
    wonder we don't know the recipe for building it into our
    software. But unlike with UI design, software QWAN can only come
    from the programmer, who is playing the roles of interior decorator,
    head chef, and ergonomic consultant for all the programmer-users of
    said software.
