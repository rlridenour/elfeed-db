The Task An old (ie 10+ years old) desktop application needed to be converted to a web application for modernization purposes. The program was a simple display of textbook-style information with links to audio content. We decided to build this with as simple a technology as possible, with hopes for longevity to exceed what it has had before: raw HTML and CSS, with as little Javascript as possible, optimizing compatibility1, longevity, and load time.
