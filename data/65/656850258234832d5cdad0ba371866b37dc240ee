<p>Apple, on its Apple Ads site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Search is the way most people find and download apps on the App
Store, with nearly 65 percent of downloads happening directly
after a search. To help give advertisers more opportunities to
drive downloads from search results, Apple Ads will introduce
additional ads across search queries. You don’t need to change
your campaign in order to be eligible for any new positions. Your
ad will run in either the existing position — at the top of
search results — or further down in search results. If you have a
search results campaign running, your ad will be automatically
eligible for all available positions, but you can’t select or bid
for a particular one.</p>

<p>The ad format will be the same in any position, using a default
product page or custom product page, and an optional deep link.
You’ll be billed as usual based on your pricing model: cost per
tap or cost per install.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
