<p>Syria’s government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced a new ceasefire framework that lays out a phased integration of SDF forces and Kurdish-run institutions into the Syrian state, aiming to avert a wider fight in the northeast. The plan includes withdrawals from front lines and the start of an integration process as government-affiliated Interior Ministry security forces move into the northeastern cities of Hasakah and Qamishli, areas where the SDF had held sway. The agreement comes after government forces expanded their control in northern and eastern Syria this month, narrowing the SDF’s territory and heightening uncertainty over the future of the group and Kurdish autonomy arrangements that developed during the civil war. US envoy Tom Barrack described the deal as a “historic milestone,” framing it as a step toward national reconciliation and stability as Syria’s post-Assad leadership seeks to consolidate authority after nearly 14 years of conflict.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/VSkFws7cFmxW_tKoZTJjWCz11xr5xVAi_9sKXFyKKliB9uX-G6HAatUl1rVNHWEw5vNkD12lHoR9OXdUoq7O9TwDuO-LC7MxprTGpnfkn-4E' alt='Members of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) queue to settle their status with Syrian government in Raqqa, Syria, January 27, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>City deployments: Under the terms announced, Interior Ministry security forces would deploy to central areas of Hasakah and Qamishli after SDF pullbacks, marking a shift in on-the-ground control inside two key northeastern cities.</li><li>Force structure: The deal outlines a new military division incorporating three SDF brigades and a separate brigade for Kobani (Ain al-Arab) that would be affiliated with Aleppo governorate, giving the integration a concrete unit-based structure.</li><li>Civil institutions: Kurdish-led governing bodies and administrative institutions set up in the northeast are slated to merge into Syrian state institutions, expanding the agreement beyond purely military arrangements.</li><li>Earlier efforts: Damascus and the SDF previously struck an integration agreement last March but made little progress before a year-end deadline, a stall that preceded the latest escalation and renewed push for implementation.</li><li>Why it matters: Analysts cited in coverage described the arrangement as potentially historic because it seeks to bring the SDF into Syria’s new army through negotiation rather than a prolonged battle over autonomy in the northeast.</li></ul><blockquote>A profound and historic milestone in Syria’s journey towards national reconciliation, unity, and enduring stability - Tom Barrack</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Syrian government: Damascus presented the agreement as a route to unify governance and security, including Interior Ministry deployments and the merging of northeastern institutions into the state.
