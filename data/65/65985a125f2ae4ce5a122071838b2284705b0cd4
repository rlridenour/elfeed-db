<p>The Norwegian Nobel Institute confirmed that Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado will not attend Wednesday’s award ceremony in Oslo, saying her daughter Ana Corina Sosa will accept the prize on her behalf instead. Machado has been in hiding in Venezuela for more than a year after authorities opened criminal cases against her and warned she would be treated as a fugitive if she tried to leave the country to receive the prize. A planned pre-ceremony press conference where she was expected to make her first public appearance in months was abruptly canceled after hours of delay, deepening uncertainty about her whereabouts and security situation. The Peace Prize honors her leadership of Venezuela’s democratic opposition and comes as President Nicolás Maduro’s government faces continued international criticism over the country’s political and human rights climate.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/J5px0fwYdlUnrjufplUq4rZmKnd8JqIsLLqW_Fd_zb8WU9y0yCmEvnqT8-YN1UK1HQKFCJMJn3Ijzu2Tfigs6vMwobeDXw1VfGFvWGD7EmUhk7yH03p01mmr4ScTgN5oPlLm_slvnWXfWEwolIEI9V_PA5YZOR5d3_rfeFHFwBUCYyzhEqfhOkNB' alt='María Corina Machado in her Caracas office in 2024, before going into hiding ahead of receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Daughter’s role: Ana Corina Sosa has been in Oslo meeting with supporters of Venezuela’s democratic movement and will stand in for her mother on stage at the city hall ceremony, symbolically linking exiled activists and those still inside the country.</li><li>Risk of arrest: Venezuela’s attorney general has stated that Machado would be considered a fugitive if she left the country to accept the prize, a warning that raised the stakes of any attempt to travel to Norway.</li><li>Canceled appearance: The Norwegian Nobel Institute delayed and then called off a news conference on Tuesday at which Machado was widely expected to appear remotely or in person, without giving a detailed public explanation for the cancellation.</li><li>Support and criticism: While Nobel officials praise Machado’s nonviolent push for free elections and institutional reform, some critics highlight her alignment with President Trump’s tougher stance and military buildup against the Maduro government as a reason to question the choice of laureate.</li><li>Visibility for opposition: Machado’s award has drawn Venezuelan activists and diaspora supporters to Oslo and is widely seen by them as a rare moment of global visibility for the country’s opposition after years of political setbacks at home.</li></ul><blockquote>This prize belongs to every Venezuelan who has not given up on democracy and dignity. - María Corina Machado</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Norwegian Nobel Institute: The Institute has emphasized that the prize recognizes Machado’s role in pursuing a peaceful, democratic transition in Venezuela through elections and civic mobilization despite pressure from authorities.
