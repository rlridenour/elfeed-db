<p>Coordinated attacks struck several districts in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Saturday, hitting targets that included police stations, paramilitary installations and civilians, according to officials and multiple reports. Authorities said security forces responded with clearance operations across affected areas, including Quetta and other towns. Casualty figures varied by outlet and official briefings, but reports consistently described significant losses on all sides, including civilians, security personnel and dozens of militants. Separatists from Balochistan claimed responsibility for the near-simultaneous attacks, underscoring the province’s long-running insurgency and the challenge of protecting communities spread across a vast, rugged region. Even amid the tragedy, officials framed the rapid response as preventing further harm, with security operations continuing across the province to restore order and safeguard residents.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/TpkizcApl2IjZs1qEXZi9BF3v9KLgio_PtdRhftWYjxdzCg70DJKrMR19px3d9AnxYlzLL_GWX9fooJ_O1r1ZUTPT0FcYRuBF9m3j4NKPxYjCLd_bjEUZ8vIW5zGjDUalsurVLnO8zbNw_KBwJDyOy5rVkSYLH4cZG3dkrj3Vw' alt='Security activity is reported after coordinated attacks across Pakistan’s Balochistan province.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Targets hit: Reports said attackers used guns and grenades and struck a high-security prison alongside police and paramilitary sites, indicating a multi-target plan rather than a single assault.</li><li>Claimed responsibility: The Balochistan Liberation Army was identified as the militant group behind the coordinated attacks in reporting that described an unusually synchronized wave of strikes.</li><li>Wider geography: Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said incidents were reported in locations including Quetta, Gwadar, Makran, Hub, Chaman and Naseerabad.</li><li>Civilian toll: Pakistan’s military said militants targeted civilians in several areas, with women and children among those killed.</li><li>Cross-border setting: Balochistan borders Afghanistan and Iran and is described as mineral-rich, factors frequently cited in coverage of the region’s persistent unrest and security focus.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pakistan security officials: Officials said security forces engaged militants across multiple cities and conducted clearance operations, reporting large militant casualties following the coordinated attacks.
