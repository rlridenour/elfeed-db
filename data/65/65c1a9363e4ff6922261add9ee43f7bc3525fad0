I find myself going back to regular WMs (my favorite from the past being KDE) because certain tasks are just deeply punishing in EXWM. When I&rsquo;m doing my regular daily work I can usually make EXWM work for me. But here are the facts I experience with/without emacs as my window manager.
Life is worse without EXWM  Winum. Looking at a screen and hitting the num to focus there; I miss it dearly and cringe when I need to reach for the mouse.
