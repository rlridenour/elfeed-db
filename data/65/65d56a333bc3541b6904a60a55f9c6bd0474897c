<p>Greetings! It’s a busy time of year for many of us, so this will be brief.</p>
<p>I’m going to share with you one idea and one link that can help you figure out what<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>good enough” can look like when your mind and your schedule are too full to get everything done. Plain text related, naturally, but both can apply to any well-balanced life.</p>
<h3 id="whats-your-personal-manifesto">What’s your personal manifesto?</h3>
<p>Speaking of life in general, do you know why you do what you do? And what you truly value?</p>
<p>When that is clear, other things tend to fall into place. It might take a while — years even — but in the end you’ll find that the order of things will feel right. This applies to the practices, events, habits, and tools we allow into our lives.</p>
<p>So, what do you value most? I recommend writing down everything that makes up the bedrock of who you are, and who you want to be. Frame every task or project you are considering taking on through that lens and take note of what you see.</p>

<p>I liked so many things about Blake Ashley Jr.’s article <a href="https://blakeashleyjr.com/posts/elephant-my-plaintext-work-system/" target="_blank">Elephant: My Plain-Text Work System</a>, I thought you might enjoy it too. He has found a way to be gentle with himself while still getting the most important things done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find this combination of plain-text, simpleness, and pressure avoidance really works wonders for my productivity. Most days, I am able to make progress on what I need to do, which is a miracle knowing where I came from. Occasionally, I won’t get much done, and that’s okay. It’ll still be there when I get back, only without any warnings or red text telling me how much of a failure I have been.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The elephant idea is powerful. I’ve ordered the book that inspired it (“The Righteous Mind”, by Jonathan Haidt) and am looking forward to reading it over the new year period.</p>
