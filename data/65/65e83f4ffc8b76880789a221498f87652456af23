The public will be able to test upcoming AirPods firmware updates through the free <a href="https://beta.apple.com/">Apple Beta Software Program</a>, with no Apple Developer account required.<br/>
<br/>
"New public betas for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, tvOS 26, HomePod software 26, watchOS 26, <strong>and AirPods Firmware</strong> are coming soon," says Apple.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/airpods-now-more-versatile-with-studio-quality-audio-recording-and-camera-remote/">press release</a>, Apple said that the first AirPods firmware public beta will be available in July.<br/>

Apple already released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/airpods-beta-firmware-ios-26/">developer beta</a> of an upcoming firmware update for the AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 last week. With the new firmware, the ‌AirPods 4‌ and AirPods Pro 2 gain support for improved audio quality for phone calls and video calls, plus studio-quality audio recording for interviews, podcasts, and videos. There is also an option to use AirPods as a camera remote with the Camera app to take photos or start a video recording. Plus, these AirPods models can automatically pause audio if it is detected that you fell asleep.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/15/airpods-firmware-public-betas/">Apple to Start Releasing Public Betas of AirPods Firmware Updates</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-start-releasing-public-betas-of-airpods-firmware-updates.2459065/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
