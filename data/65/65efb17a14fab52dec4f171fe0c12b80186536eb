<p>Some time ago, I wrote about <a href="https://xenodium.com/its-all-up-for-grabs-and-it-compounds/">adding multiple cursor support to symbol-overlay</a> by gluing the two packages together. If you're keen to learn how to bend Emacs to your way, have a look at that post.</p>

<p>Later on, in a &quot;Multiple cursors - how and why?&quot; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1h321x2/multiple_cursors_how_and_why">Reddit post</a>, I showcased the overlay usage. <a href="https://www.mavit.org.uk">Peter Oliver</a> asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1h321x2/comment/m06x676/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">if the package could be submitted to MELPA</a>. To my delight, he also volunteered to <a href="https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/9267">take on the submission</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had failed to check back on the MELPA submission until today. I'm happy to report that, thanks to Peter, <code>symbol-overlay-mc</code> <a href="https://melpa.org/#/symbol-overlay-mc">is now on MELPA</a>.</p>
<p>Happy symbol-overlay-multiple-cursors editing! ;)</p>
