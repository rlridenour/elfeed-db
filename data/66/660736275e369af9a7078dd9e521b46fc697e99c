Apple expanded its lead in the global tablet market in late 2025 as overall shipments rebounded, according to new research from <a href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/pr/2026/feb/global-tablet-shipments-grew-10percent-in-2025-as-market-nears-slowdown">Omdia</a>.<br/>

Global tablet shipments reportedly reached 162 million units in 2025, representing 9.8% year-over-year growth. The research firm said the strongest momentum occurred during the holiday quarter, when shipments reached 44 million units, also up 9.8% compared to the same quarter a year earlier. Omdia described the annual total as the highest shipment volume recorded since the surge in demand seen in 2020, partly caused by anticipation of memory supply constraints.<br/>

Apple was a key contributor to the market's late-year growth. Omdia says that Apple shipped 19.6 million iPads in the fourth quarter of 2025, representing a 16.5% year-over-year increase. The firm said this performance was driven by strong demand for the 11th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and the M5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth-quarter results increased Apple's market share to 44.9%. This placed Apple well ahead of other tablet vendors during the holiday quarter, with Samsung at 14.7%, Lenovo at 8.8%, Huawei at 6.9%, and Xiaomi at 6.4%. Other manufacturers collectively accounted for the remaining 18.3% of shipments.<br/>
<br/>
The report also highlighted changes in how tablets are expected to be positioned in the coming years, including greater emphasis on ecosystem integration and artificial intelligence features:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>On the product side, we expect a shift in how tablets are positioned and marketed, with vendors framing them as ecosystem-centric devices in a more controlled demand environment. This includes the introduction of cross-OS functionality and a focus on AI-driven experiences. Recent examples include Lenovo's Qira, which operates across Windows and Android to deliver a more seamless user experience and reduce friction between AI assistants. In addition, the collaboration between Apple and Google to use Gemini for future Apple Intelligence features represents a positive step forward for the generative AI ecosystem across its device portfolio, including iPads.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Regional performance varied across the year. Omdia said Central and Eastern Europe recorded the fastest growth in 2025, followed by Asia Pacific. All regions experienced double-digit growth except North America, where vendor and retail discounting helped offset an otherwise declining trend during the holiday season.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/omdia/">Omdia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/ipad-demand-surges/">iPad Demand Surges as Apple Strengthens Grip on Tablet Market</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-demand-surges-as-apple-strengthens-grip-on-tablet-market.2477236/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
