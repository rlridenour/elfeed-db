<p>New Zealand police have ended rescue efforts and are now running a recovery operation after a landslide swept into a holiday park campground at Mount Maunganui, with six people still unaccounted for. Authorities say they uncovered human remains in the debris, and warn the search and identification process may take days and be complex because the ground remains unstable. The incident followed days of severe weather, with some reports linking landslides and flooding across the country to additional fatalities.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/vi7vGLTXETdReTfnMp1AA2c0pz01dRQIjkmGPKjuhve6Ooo82BqxDzitbuWTYj7syDcpLaXWvVAB5mKW-r8TWxZ1ki-5XCDgNFCb532wvjMJp1FnBDlkf1DuprxFeZcJVVLALMr9iOC05vq3CR7H3MwtaRLFb4HGhNUOcpmmvGlXsYpIENBGYk2N10jgjUIQfo3rHmWQQld-YlPEaWRao2vob0tFVX2Yb1Nzaps_2n57bR_VBbO1SUGdOgrlk6lTIKVGB3YV5osizt76o1jH' alt='Emergency crews work at the Mount Maunganui holiday park landslide site.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Identification process: New Zealand’s coroner’s office cautioned that identifying recovered remains could be long and complicated, reflecting the condition of the remains and the scene.</li><li>Victims remembered: DW reported that two of the six presumed dead were teenagers, underscoring the loss for families and the community.</li><li>Operational timeline: Police said the recovery may take several days because the debris field remains dangerous and unstable.</li><li>Evacuation scrutiny: One outlet reported questions about why the campground was not evacuated earlier, signaling scrutiny of preparedness and warnings.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>New Zealand Police: Police said they do not expect to find more survivors and have shifted from rescue to recovery because conditions are unsafe and progress is slow.
