<p>Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the United States wants Russia and Ukraine to wrap up negotiations to end the war by June, framing it as a push to reach a settlement before early summer. Zelenskyy said Washington has invited both sides to hold further talks in the United States as soon as next week. Diplomacy has picked up in recent weeks, but it is still stuck on the core question of territory. Russia occupies about 20% of Ukraine and is seeking full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region as part of any agreement, while Ukraine says it will not accept a deal it believes could invite renewed aggression later. The US-led process has produced one concrete humanitarian step so far: a prisoner-of-war exchange.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/hhG7CVYtwCmr6cLlq4OU7fNWUQC5E7mtQPdSXH_vzDi53e5_trsjGyJyNNU6eeFfUvYezl8AlSN3aAqxEy2luaXKL043EG09mAbSMmaj' alt='Firefighters work at the site of a Russian drone and missile strike in Kyiv.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Proposal detail: Dawn says Washington has floated an idea for land Ukraine holds in Donetsk to become a “free economic zone,” with neither side allowed to deploy military forces there.</li><li>Talks format: RT says the Abu Dhabi rounds were held behind closed doors, and Russia and the US later described the discussions as “productive” and “constructive”.</li><li>Domestic timing: Zelenskyy said US domestic politics—including November midterm elections—may be pushing Washington to speed up diplomacy toward a summer deadline.</li></ul><blockquote>They say that they want to do everything by June, - Volodymyr Zelenskyy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine (Zelenskyy): Zelenskyy said Washington has proposed—apparently for the first time—that Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams meet in the United States, likely in Miami, within about a week.
