<p>I&rsquo;ve built a paywall system for this blog. It was quite an endeavor to make a home-grown solution that works with my static Jekyll site, but I think I got it.</p>

<p>From now on, I&rsquo;ll be adding bonus content to posts that will only available to subscribers. You can subscribe at any level &mdash; the benefits are the same whether you pay $3, $6, or $12 per month. You can subscribe using PayPal, with or without a PayPal account. I&rsquo;m going to be phasing out Memberful as I&rsquo;m able to switch over the subscribers there. So <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//support/">become a subscriber today</a> and don&rsquo;t miss out on anything.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>All of my current supporters should automatically have been ported to the new system, and should be able to log in just by providing the email address with which they used to subscribe. (If you&rsquo;re currently using Memberful, please consider cancelling there and re-subscribing via the links on the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//support/">support page</a>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a benefit that I hope will make subscribing worthwhile, I&rsquo;ve negotiated <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//member-discounts/">hundreds of dollars in savings from my favorite software developers</a>, with 10-50% discounts about 40 apps and services (and growing), including discounts on books and educational screencasts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also going to implement a paid tier on the <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">forum</a>, but I&rsquo;m not planning to <em>not</em> converse with non-paying subscribers, so I&rsquo;ll have to figure out what the benefit there will be.</p>

<p>I have no intention of paywalling my best content, or limit access to any of my projects. Paywalled content will be bonus content within publicly-available posts. It&rsquo;s really still just a way to support my work, so if you appreciate what I do and want to see more of it, please do consider subscribing.</p>

<p>As a demonstration, I&rsquo;m going to detail how I built this system as bonus content. So if you want to see that, subscribe.</p>
