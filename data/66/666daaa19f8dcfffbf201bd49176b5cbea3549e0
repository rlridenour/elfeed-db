Back before I became an Emacser, a friend who <i>was</i> an Emacser said that I shouldn&rsquo;t worry about the Emacs keybindings because I could configure them to be whatever I want. I remember thinking that that would be disaster. After all, what would I do if I were using Emacs on someone else&rsquo;s computer or even setting up a new computer.

Now, of course, I have a <i>very</i> individualistic configuration that makes working on someone else&rsquo;s computer uncomfortable. Uncomfortable but not impossible. That&rsquo;s because although I have all sorts of specialized editing commands, I&rsquo;ve left the &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; editing commands—cursor movements, file visiting and saving, and other standard operations—alone. That means that if I use someone else&rsquo;s Emacs I can edit successfully, if not optimally, as long as the guest Emacs also didn&rsquo;t mess with the standard bindings.

<p>
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not entirely sympathetic to The MKat&rsquo;s post on <a href="https://themkat.net/2025/05/13/emacs_unset_keys.html">how to unset default key bindings</a>. She&rsquo;s got a lot of great advice on how to delete keybindings and I agree that it&rsquo;s useful information to have. My objection is to the notion that you <i>should</i> delete bindings that you don&rsquo;t like.

Just yesterday, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12984">I discussed how modern keyboards aren&rsquo;t optmal for Emacs</a> so it&rsquo;s natural to want to fix that somehow. Yesterday&rsquo;s post suggests some ways of doing that but none of them involve changing default keybindings.
</p>
<p>
Sure, some folks have special needs that make one binding or another difficult but in general, I think it&rsquo;s a bad idea to be messing with them. Of course, this is Emacs and everyone can adjust it to their liking. I&rsquo;m not arguing with that. I&rsquo;m only saying that if you stay with the defaults it will be easier for you to use an alien Emacs.</p>
