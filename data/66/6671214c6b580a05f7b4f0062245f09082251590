Rumors continue to surface about Apple launching an affordable MacBook as early as this year.<br/>

Below, we recap all of the reports and rumors so far.<br/>
<br/>
Taiwanese supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em> expects the laptop to have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/new-12-9-inch-macbook-launch-this-year-599-price/"><strong>starting price of between &#36;599 and &#36;699</strong></a> in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The publication said the lower-cost MacBook will be equipped with a <strong>12.9-inch display</strong>, and a version of the <strong>A18 Pro chip</strong> that debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro models last year. It would become the first Mac to ever use an A-series chip from an iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
The lower-cost MacBook could launch in <strong>late 2025 or early 2026</strong>, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">first to reveal</a> that Apple is allegedly planning a more affordable MacBook. In late June, he also said the laptop will have around a 13-inch display, and an A18 Pro chip. Kuo said potential color options include <strong>silver, blue, pink, and yellow</strong>, so the laptop could come in bright colors, like the iMac.<br/>
<br/>
A18 Pro specs include a 6-core CPU, a 6-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The chip is around 40% slower than the M4 chip, but its <strong>performance is comparable to the M1 chip</strong>, so this new MacBook could effectively be a replacement for the old MacBook Air with the M1 chip, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/walmart-m1-macbook-air-for-649/">Apple still sells through Walmart for <s>&#36;649</s></a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-599-at-walmart/">&#36;599</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In the iPhone 16 Pro models, the A18 Pro chip has <strong>8GB of RAM</strong>, whereas all current MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models start with at least 16GB of RAM. In addition, the chip <strong>lacks Thunderbolt support</strong>, so the new MacBook would likely be equipped with regular USB-C ports. They would look the same as Thunderbolt ports, but data transfer speeds would be limited to up to 10 Gb/s, and the new MacBook might natively support only a single external display, but that limitation can be overcome with DisplayLink adapters.<br/>
<br/>
The lower-cost MacBook could have a lot in common with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/12-inch-macbook-introduced-10-years-ago/">discontinued 12-inch MacBook</a>, including an ultra-thin and lightweight design. It would slot in below the MacBook Air, which has a slightly larger 13.6-inch display, an M4 chip, and a starting price of &#36;999. However, the latest MacBook Air is often on sale on Amazon for as low as &#36;799.<br/>
