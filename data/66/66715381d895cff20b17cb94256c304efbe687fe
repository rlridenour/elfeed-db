Barring further delays, the first beta version of iOS 26.4 is apparently set to release to developers during the week of February 23. The update will "include some components" of the long-anticipated improvements to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman added that iOS 27 will deliver further &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; improvements, but WWDC will be "a fairly muted affair this year." The main new features will be a "more personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; with a chatbot interface." Apple is said to be focused on improving performance, fixing bugs, and fine-tuning the design of its software platforms this year.  <br/>
