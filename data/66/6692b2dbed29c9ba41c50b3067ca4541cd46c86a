<p>New video game, just out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Herdling is a brand new adventure from <a href="https://okomotive.ch/">Okomotive</a>, creators of
the atmospheric and acclaimed FAR games, and <a href="https://panic.com/">Panic</a>,
publishers of Firewatch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks absolutely beautiful. Painterly. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/darthbluesky.bsky.social/post/3lww42zzkjs2q">Darth says it’s good</a>.</p>

<p>Available now for Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Epic Games Store. Not (yet?) in the Mac App Store — not because of any hassles regarding the App Store, but because there’s not (yet?) a Mac port of the game, period.</p>
