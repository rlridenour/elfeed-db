<blockquote>
  <p>But there are also potential risks to making Federighi head of AI.
Giving oversight of AI to him reflects Apple’s cautious approach
to the technology. He is known at Apple as a penny-pincher who
keeps a tight rein on salaries and hesitates to invest in risky
projects when the payoff from them isn’t clear, according to
people who have worked with him. He tends to scrutinize every
detail of his team’s expenses, down to their budgets for bananas
and other office snacks, those people said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Apple’s rivals are pouring vast amounts of capital into
AI, building data centers and paying fortunes to woo AI
researchers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea what Federighi’s stance is on break-room bananas, but it seems a stretch to think it offers clues to Apple’s strategy on data centers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For years, lieutenants of Federighi would try to get him on board
with AI. He often shot those efforts down, former Apple executives
said. For example, he rejected proposals from his team to use AI
to dynamically change the iPhone home screen, believing it would
disorient users, who are used to knowing where their apps are
located, said former Apple employees familiar with the proposal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus H. Christ, thank god Federighi shot this down. I wouldn’t want <em>good</em> AI rearranging my home screen behind my back, let alone Apple Intelligence as we know it.</p>
