<p>The White House said President Trump and his advisers are discussing “a range of options” to acquire Greenland, and said use of the U.S. military is “always an option” as the administration frames the island as a national-security priority in the Arctic. Denmark and Greenland responded by seeking talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, while insisting decisions about Greenland’s future rest with its people. European leaders and Canada publicly rallied behind Denmark and Greenland, emphasizing the inviolability of borders and warning that any forced move against a NATO ally would severely strain the alliance.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Cq9CPsnPCx0AYHYuwxQFxcuoQdy9JFrQSNj9afZSj5xc290sj6FpFlH91E9SD-bfIS51Qdw4Xp9EPb4HYww8FBhXAJeK94aOYsL4fvUvmj1LKn0ZQDbWhNinBZZRK7jGI6iQt5CQMMF7ZC0SG0xL0V6SGHxf5SBMdtl1IiF7QbE7wcgj6MtAJH23UrH4fLOXmSCaV11qDrvjnAlQVZpH1mxJ3LJZwxZ_L2wabsJdImqcCtXzFtQ' alt='President Emmanuel Macron greets Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen ahead of a Paris summit.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Arctic deterrence: The White House said the Greenland push is aimed at “deter our adversaries in the Arctic region,” reflecting rising strategic competition in the High North.</li><li>Diplomacy channel: Secretary of State Marco Rubio tried to soften the rhetoric by emphasizing that a preferred path would be to buy Greenland rather than use force.</li><li>NATO anxiety: Some European leaders argue that a U.S. seizure of a Danish territory would collide with NATO’s collective-defense logic and could put the alliance’s cohesion at risk.</li><li>Resource realities: Some coverage notes Greenland’s oil and mineral potential, but also highlights that harsh climate, sea ice and the ice sheet make extraction difficult and costly.</li><li>Defense footprint: Greenland’s location has been central to North American defense planning since World War II, a backdrop often cited in today’s strategic debate.</li></ul><blockquote>The President and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. Military is always an option at the Commander in Chief’s disposal. - Karoline Leavitt</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House: The administration describes acquiring Greenland as a U.S. national security priority and says military force remains an available option.
