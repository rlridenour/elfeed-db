<p>France says it intercepted and seized the oil tanker Grinch in the western Mediterranean on Thursday as the ship transited near the Strait of Gibraltar, calling it subject to international sanctions and suspected of sailing under a false flag. President Emmanuel Macron said the action aimed to enforce sanctions and uphold international law, and officials said the operation included intelligence support from the United Kingdom. The vessel was diverted to port and France said a judicial investigation has been opened, turning the boarding into a legal process rather than a purely military one.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/CaJut4hivDrFxgMTdPu0Gf3vnnhh5njZD7DrXCoibs5eCCG5KqjwqEEdjq7z6Di1Cnt1F_c4q_0Qe6GIdqzpI6jBiWjKm47P3GP6CA8cB5aKZpMtcLdywBuJF3o2cQGpAF6YHZyzlzsRD_Dx_Ab8oEdb2XFF9nrrRFz1-azfqizqphQ_OJbFM7embkiHeZ3cS-S0vYv3' alt='Illustrative image used in coverage of France’s interception of a Russia-linked tanker in the Mediterranean.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ship details: Maritime authorities said the Grinch had sailed from Murmansk in northwest Russia and was reported as flying the flag of Comoros, a detail cited in claims it used deceptive registration practices.</li><li>How shadow fleets work: POLITICO reported that vessels described as part of Russia’s “shadow fleet” often use misleading flags and may switch off transponders to reduce tracking while moving oil or other cargoes despite sanctions.</li><li>Prior France case: French authorities pointed to an earlier Atlantic-coast case in October in which French forces arrested two crew members on a tanker suspected of shadow-fleet links, underscoring a pattern of stepped-up enforcement.</li><li>Legal framing: Macron said the boarding took place on the high seas and was conducted in “strict compliance” with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, signaling France’s intent to ground the action in maritime law.</li><li>Disputed basis: RT argued Western states lack legal authority to enforce sanctions on the high seas under UNCLOS and disputed the idea of a Russian-operated “shadow fleet,” framing the term as vessels moving Russian oil outside Western insurance coverage.</li></ul><blockquote>We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions. - Emmanuel Macron</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>France (President Emmanuel Macron): France says the tanker was sanctioned and suspected of a false flag, and that the operation enforced sanctions while respecting the law of the sea.
