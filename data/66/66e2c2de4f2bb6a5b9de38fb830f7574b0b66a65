  <p>We’ve seen a broad range of content, but I’ve been waiting for
something live — specifically, live sports. Seeing that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/exclusive-those-phones-are-being-treated-just-like-any-other-camera-inside-apples-first-friday-night-baseball-broadcast-shot-on-iphone-17-pro">Apple
TV+’s <em>Friday Night Baseball</em> is capturing games with the iPhone
17 Pro and 17 Pro Max</a> gave me some hope, and now we have a
confirmed release. In what might be the start of something new,
select Los Angeles Lakers games will be live-streamed in Apple
Immersive for the Vision Pro this coming season.</p>

<p>It’s not every game, but for those that are streaming — exclusive
to the $3,500 Spatial Computer — you’ll get access to views that
put you right in the middle of the action. Special cameras that
support the format will be set courtside and under each basket to
give you perspectives that amp up the immersion. The Lakers’ games
will be shot using a special version of Blackmagic Design’s URSA
Cine Immersive Live camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of weird, to me, that it wasn’t Apple’s own Friday Night Baseball broadcasts first, but I can’t wait to try this.</p>
