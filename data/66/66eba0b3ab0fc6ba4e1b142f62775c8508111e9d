<p>MG Siegler:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The underlying message that they’re trying to convey in all these
interviews is clear: <em>calm down, this isn’t a big deal, you guys
are being a little crazy</em>. And that, in turn, aims to undercut all
the reporting about <a href="https://spyglass.org/theres-no-free-lunch-at-apple/">the turmoil within Apple</a> — <em>for
<a href="https://spyglass.org/apple-ai-fail/">years</a> at this <a href="https://spyglass.org/siri-apple-ai-trouble/">point</a></em> — that has led to the
situation with Siri. Sorry, the situation which they’re implying
is not a situation. Though, I don’t know, normally when a company
<a href="https://spyglass.org/siri-shakeup/">shakes up an entire team</a>, that tends to suggest some sort
of situation. That, of course, is never mentioned. Nor would you
expect Apple — of all companies — to talk openly and candidly
about internal challenges. But that just adds to this general
wafting smell in the air.</p>

<p>The smell of bullshit.</p>
