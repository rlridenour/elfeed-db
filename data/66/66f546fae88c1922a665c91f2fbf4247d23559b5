<p>Tropical Cyclone Gezani tore across Madagascar this week, slamming into the port city of Toamasina with powerful winds and heavy rain that collapsed homes and damaged infrastructure. Authorities said at least 31 people were killed, and several were still missing as crews tried to reach areas cut off by the storm. Officials kept revising casualty and damage figures as assessments continued, while access to some hard-hit areas remained difficult.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/12Y38NH1bP6R5AL-rgapOPdfNZtLyk2CrqnGvi0XSJ4oxV5yRW-vMgCtYbwIjAf7sc7rsGpkSh4YDstLhOfrhgH46Nfejpt5_WHZ1Q1zyRvWKdscyjnUm2wmChh4X_W2ot6NGHJum1d3PIhMem-vfTzKDgFme7pCsvXcMHkOevPx-yZSOrQ-ribFPxMFJ34AtF5wCslpVkhu727V97sqbKJ0IWDbOdFNk8giLCABug7Mnq1HbTRtoT0bjg_bcCFo1ij4' alt='Storm damage after Cyclone Gezani struck Madagascar.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of disruption: Authorities estimate about 250,000 people have been affected by Cyclone Gezani, pointing to widespread disruption beyond the hardest-hit areas.</li><li>Housing impact indicator: In Toamasina, early assessments found about 90% of roofs had been ripped off, deepening immediate shelter needs.</li><li>Early toll reporting: Initial media reports listed lower fatality figures before officials updated the death toll to at least 31 as more information came in.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Madagascar disaster management authorities: Officials said the storm left some roads impassable after uprooted trees and downed power poles blocked access, slowing relief efforts and damage assessments.
