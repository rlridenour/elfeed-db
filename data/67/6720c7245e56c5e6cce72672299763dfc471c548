<p>Chinese authorities have told citizens to avoid travelling to Japan after Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi said an armed attack on Taiwan could warrant a military response from Tokyo, remarks she made to parliament on November 7. Beijing framed the advisory as part of a broader diplomatic escalation that included public warnings about intervention and sharp rhetoric directed at Tokyo. The development has immediate travel and commercial consequences, with airlines and governments responding as tensions between the two capitals intensify.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/hvrQUM8Ml-5GGp-uIywMDSN3z2jX1BWRAY4SGpk_4Fy-jVmoxyvAx55sLy2BTuP88w4EbRTESuQqCDgJtg8z6cn7V9VZ_VfW9IQA8MKtJ_zFM0uWtoHwneqlJhImd-rRMbTwXyOPrT5uOf5P-0qupGizUPyRFb4eEMH7fRAMugu3KV7NSgjw5dN0YSwGL5eykgJIVHrNoFQXFxIHFGpjC9HO-6zjJdt6Zdcf2g3iS6RDq5nHsI_nQkx5Cc8WrA0LFYEo83Z5RXwuxCa_8w' alt='Japan&#x27;s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi at a parliament committee session in Tokyo on Friday; she said a Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Airline response: China&#x27;s largest carriers — Air China, China Southern and China Eastern — permitted free refunds or itinerary changes for Japan flights beginning Saturday, signalling measurable commercial disruption to travel between the countries.</li><li>Diplomatic escalation: Tokyo summoned Beijing&#x27;s ambassador to protest a top Chinese diplomat&#x27;s online post and continued exchanges of formal protests, marking a week of reciprocal diplomatic moves.</li><li>Military rhetoric: Beijing publicly warned Japan it would face a &#x27;crushing&#x27; defeat if it intervened militarily over Taiwan, language that intensified the dispute&#x27;s security framing.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Chinese government: Chinese authorities advised citizens against travel to Japan amid growing tensions over comments by Japan&#x27;s prime minister.
