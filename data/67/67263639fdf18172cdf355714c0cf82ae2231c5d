</ul><h1>Inflation is Rough</h1><p>Right now we’re teeing you up to be <em>maaaaaaaaaaaad</em> and not just because “inflation” is probably going to be the Oxford Dictionary agitating word of the year.</p>
<p>You’re not going to be mad about the price of eggs or whatever, though. You’re going to be mad…at you.</p>
<p>Because despite how we built the revenue projections when launching <a href="http://meh.com">meh.com</a> back in the day in between yacht shopping and pinky ring sizing, not <em>everyone</em> reading this is going to buy today’s deal.</p>
<p>(Seriously, though. If we could get ya’ll to 100 percent purchase conversion based on the strength of the copywriting and the undeniable dealiness of the deals, it would be super helpful as we try stepping up from consumer retail and launch a private space travel endeavor, as is fashionable today. Just think it over, is all we’re saying.)</p>
<p>Anyway, back to future you being <em>maaaaaaaaaaaad</em> later. You’re going to be mad later because at some point you’re going to have low tire pressure and limp your way to the gas station just to find out that their air machine is broken and/or requires a bunch of quarters that you don’t have.</p>
<p>As your leaky tire slowly descends you into stranded frustration, you’ll remember how inexpensively you could have avoided this whole situation with a tool that would have fit in your glovebox and been there when you needed it.</p>
<p>If only.</p>
<p>But as if not being stuck immobilized in a dark parking lot somewhere isn’t enough of a selling point, it’s worth mentioning that these things are amazing when it comes to annoying-to-inflate items like pool toys and bike tires and basketballs. So instead of getting lightheaded by the pool trying to blow up a giant floating unicorn using only your lungs and your grit while your family looks on unimpressed, you could be effortlessly solving the problem with the push of a button.</p>
<p>The point here is that with all the news about inflation these days, it’s tempting to think that there’s nothing you can do about it, but this thing is here to prove you wrong. It’s a great deal that demonstrates how some products, like a trusty CostCo hotdog, remain within financial reach, unlike…[<em>gestures generally</em>].</p>
<p>After all, inflation isn’t <em>just</em> something that happened to your favorite fast food value item. It’s also a thing that you can do with a little electric air pump you got from Meh. And isn’t that something where we can all come together and agree?</p>
