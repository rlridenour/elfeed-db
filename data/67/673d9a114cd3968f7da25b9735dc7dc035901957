<p>Counterpoint Research, in a report titled “Global Smart Glasses Shipments Soared 110 Percent YoY in H1 2025, With Meta Capturing Over 70 Percent Share”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The global smart glasses market grew by 110% YoY in H1 2025,
fueled by robust demand for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and the
entry of new players such as Xiaomi and TCL-RayNeo.</p>

<p>Meta’s share of the global smart glasses market rose to 73% in H1
2025, driven by strong demand and expanded manufacturing capacity
at Luxottica, its key production partner.</p>

<p>Not a single absolute sales number in the whole report, not even estimated. Just percentages. Pure Bezos Numbers — which is not quite the same thing as a <a href="https://x.com/jsnell/status/481863414180896769">Bezos Chart</a>, which has no numbers at all. How do you compute percentage change without the underlying numbers? What goes unsaid is that surely any reasonable estimate of “smart glasses” sales numbers is tiny. If you go from 1 to 2 that’s 100 percent growth!</p>
