<p>Drew Saur, pushing back on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/14/commodore-64-ultimate">my post</a> slagging on the Commodore 64:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I cannot argue with your nostalgia. It is uniquely yours.</p>

<p>That said: The Commodore 64 as cheap-feeling and inelegant! Oh my.</p>

<p>I was fourteen when the Commodore 64 came out, and I want to
convey — in as brief a form as I can — why it captured so many
hearts during the 8-bit era.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a great post. Fond memories all the way down the stack with that whole era of computing. As I told Saur in email, my fondest memory of the Commodore 64 is that they sold them at Kmart, and for years had a working model on display. And every time I’d go to Kmart with my mom, I’d swing by the electronics department and type:</p>

<pre><code>10 PRINT "KMART SUCKS!!!!"
20 GOTO 10
RUN
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes I’d be clever and do something like add an incrementing number of spaces to make the lines go diagonally. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>5 LET X = 0
10 PRINT SPC(X); "KMART SUCKS!"
20 X = X + 1
30 IF X &gt; 28 THEN X = 0
35 FOR T = 0 TO 100 : NEXT : REM SLOW DOWN
40 GOTO 10
RUN
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/07/kmart-sucks.png">This</a> never got old for me. <a href="https://c64online.com/c64-online-emulator/">Try it yourself</a>. (And of course I never actually commented my code at Kmart — that <code>REM</code> is for you, if you’re wondering what that do-nothing <code>FOR</code> loop is for.)</p>
