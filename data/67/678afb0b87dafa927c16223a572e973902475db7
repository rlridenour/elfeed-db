<p id="p2">It&rsquo;s almost Labor Day in the U.S., and like most holidays, it&rsquo;s a time to save money on your favorite gadgets. Before we get to that, though, I want to thank everyone who has followed MacStories Deals on <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@MacStoriesDeals" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/macstoriesdeals.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p id="p3">We brought back MacStories Deals after a seven-year hiatus because I wasn&rsquo;t happy with any of the deal sites or social media accounts I was following myself. The volume of posts was too great, and the quality of the deals was often suspect, but in the end it all came down to a case of French&rsquo;s Yellow Mustard.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/godaddystudiopage-0-1756310694647.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p5">One day while scrolling through <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/tapbots-releases-ivory-2-0-with-hashtag-lists-and-a-redesigned-share-sheet-extension/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ivory</a>, I came across a deal for a case of 12 bottles of mustard for $9. That&rsquo;s a pretty great deal, but it&rsquo;s not what I wanted.</p>
<p id="p6">Amazon and Apple&rsquo;s stores are full of deeply discounted products, but most of them aren&rsquo;t what I want to see. The websites and social media accounts following those deals aren&rsquo;t very discriminating, either, because they&rsquo;re all about getting people to click links at scale.</p>
<p id="p7">Our bet with MacStories Deals is that we can succeed in a much different way. Our occasional deal roundups here and the media picks and deals on <a href="https://www.macstories.net/unwind/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacStories Unwind</a> showed us that the deals we share are popular with the MacStories community because we&rsquo;re picky. You can get a firehose of deals anywhere, but what you get from us &ndash; and now from MacStories Deals &ndash; is an editorial filter that respects your time by eliminating the noise.</p>
<p id="p8">So instead of sharing as many deals as possible, our approach is to share just a handful of deals each day and supplement MacStories Deals with the occasional post on the site when the deal volume warrants it. In an era when AI is flooding the zone with slop and lowering the common denominator for all content, we believe that experience and editorial constraints will serve the MacStories community better.</p>
<p id="p9">So thanks again for following MacStories Deals on <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@MacStoriesDeals" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/macstoriesdeals.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a>. It&rsquo;s just one small project of many that are in the works, but I hope you all appreciate the approach and take advantage of a deal here and there while we earn a small commission from your purchases.</p>
<p id="p10">Now, on to the Labor Day deals.</p>
<h2 id="m4-macbook-airs">M4 MacBook Airs</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/godaddystudiopage-0-1756310768561.png" alt="The 2025 13-inch M4 MacBook Air in Midnight."><p class="image-caption">The 2025&nbsp;13-inch M4 MacBook Air in Midnight.</p></div>
<p id="p12">Students are returning to school, and many will be looking for deals on Mac laptops. Currently, <a href="https://amzn.to/4oWTkCn" rel="noopener noreferrer">every M4 MacBook Air</a> in both the 13-inch and 15-inch configurations is at an all-time low price on Amazon. The MacBook Air is one of my favorite portable computers of all time, and now is a great time to pick one up.</p>
<p id="p13"><!--more--></p>
<h2 id="samsung-ssds">Samsung SSDs</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/godaddystudiopage-0-1756311126204.png" alt="Samsung's 4TB 9100 Pro SSD."><p class="image-caption">Samsung&rsquo;s 4TB 9100 Pro SSD.</p></div>
<p id="p15">Samsung has several excellent deals going on for both internal and external SSD storage. Of course, one person&rsquo;s internal storage can easily become another&rsquo;s external drive with the addition of an enclosure, so if you&rsquo;re looking to pick up SSDs on the cheap, check out the Samsung 990 line of internal storage. <a href="https://amzn.to/420kLBt" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2TB</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3VkJYmp" rel="noopener noreferrer">4TB models</a> of the 990 EVO Plus SSD are both on sale for a limited time, as is <a href="https://amzn.to/421X5wq" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 4TB 9100 Pro SSD</a>, which was just released a few months ago.</p>
<h2 id="other-storage-deals">Other Storage Deals</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/godaddystudiopage-0-1756310825878.png" alt="Samsung's T7 SSD."><p class="image-caption">Samsung&rsquo;s T7 SSD.</p></div>
<p id="p17"><a href="https://amzn.to/3VrLHGt" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung&rsquo;s 1TB T7 external SSD</a> is also on sale. I&rsquo;ve used the company&rsquo;s T5, T7, and T9 drives for years now for backups and portable storage, and I&rsquo;ve never had one fail. If you need a little extra storage for your laptop or iPad, I&rsquo;d go with one of these.</p>
<p id="p18">I don&rsquo;t have a NAS, but I wanted to highlight that <a href="https://amzn.to/423FYud" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seagate&rsquo;s IronWolf 12TB HDD</a> is on sale on Amazon, too. There has been a lot of talk about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/652364/synology-nas-third-party-hard-drive-restrictions" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synology&rsquo;s move toward requiring its own proprietary drives</a> in consumer NAS systems, but if you have an older Synology or one that doesn&rsquo;t require proprietary drives, Seagate&rsquo;s IronWolf drives, which are made for NASes, are worth considering.</p>
<h2 id="batteries-and-charging">Batteries and Charging</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/godaddystudiopage-0-1756310861290.png" alt='The Anker C1000 "Big Battery."'><p class="image-caption">The Anker C1000 &ldquo;Big Battery.&rdquo;</p></div>
<p id="p20">I think most readers know by now that I love a big battery. I&rsquo;ve been running <a href="https://amzn.to/45UVji7" rel="noopener noreferrer">an Anker C1000 battery</a> as a backup for my desktop setup for about a month, and it&rsquo;s been great. It just so happens that Amazon has a deep discount on the C1000 for a limited time.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/godaddystudiopage-0-1756310954825.png" alt="Anker's &quot;big but not huge&quot; C300 battery."><p class="image-caption">Anker&rsquo;s &ldquo;big but not huge&rdquo; C300 battery.</p></div>
<p id="p22">If the C1000 is too big for your taste, I&rsquo;d look at <a href="https://amzn.to/3HOTvz5" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anker&rsquo;s SOLIX C300</a>. It&rsquo;s considerably smaller, which means it has a smaller 288Wh capacity, but it has three standard electrical outlets and four USB ports, making it a good option for powering small appliances or just charging all of your devices at once on your next roadtrip.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/godaddystudiopage-0-1756310998808.png" alt="Anker's compact power strip."><p class="image-caption">Anker&rsquo;s compact power strip.</p></div>
<p id="p24">One of my other favorite accessories is <a href="https://amzn.to/45Z6KVZ" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anker&rsquo;s compact power strip</a> that has two pop-up standard wall outlets and four USB ports. The power strip can deliver 140W of power and has a little LED display showing the wattage each port is supplying. It&rsquo;s a simple accessory, but it&rsquo;s been perfect for working on my balcony, where I don&rsquo;t have many outlets but often need to charge or power multiple devices.</p>
<h2 id="sonos">Sonos</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/godaddystudiopage-0-1756311028741.png" alt="The Sonos Beam Gen 2 soundbar."><p class="image-caption">The Sonos Beam Gen 2 soundbar.</p></div>
<p id="p26">Sonos fans can snag some good deals now, too. I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/47LpkmU" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonos Move</a> that I love, and it&rsquo;s on sale for one of its lowest prices ever. The bargains on Amazon also extend to:</p>
<ul id="ul27"><li>the <a href="https://amzn.to/45Cg2YX" rel="noopener noreferrer">Era 300</a> smart speaker,</li>
<li>the <a href="https://amzn.to/4lNJ6BE" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roam 2</a> portable speaker, and</li>
<li>the <a href="https://amzn.to/4n2Lbuu" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beam Gen 2</a> soundbar,</li>
</ul><p id="p28">all of which have great reputations for sound quality.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/godaddystudiopage-0-1756311061294.png" alt="Insta360's Link 2 webcam."><p class="image-caption">Insta360&rsquo;s Link 2 webcam.</p></div>
<p id="p30">Another deal worth mentioning is the <a href="https://amzn.to/4n1zvbg" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insta360 Link 2 webcam</a>. I haven&rsquo;t tried this one myself, but I&rsquo;ve had enough experience with Insta360&rsquo;s other cameras to say that if I were looking to buy a webcam now, this is the one I&rsquo;d buy.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/godaddystudiopage-0-1756311085294.png" alt="It's funny looking, but Federico swears by the ProtoArc Ergonomic Mouse."><p class="image-caption">It&rsquo;s funny looking, but Federico swears by the ProtoArc Ergonomic Mouse.</p></div>
<p id="p32">Also, <a href="https://amzn.to/4mutsfy" rel="noopener noreferrer">the ProtoArc Ergonomic Mouse</a> is deeply discounted on Amazon right now. This is the mouse that Federico has been using for quite a while now and loves. It has options for both Bluetooth 5 and 2.4GHz connectivity, plus it can connect with up to three different devices. I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the <a href="https://amzn.to/41p90nW" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logitech MX Master 3S Mouse</a> for a long time, but ever since I heard about the ProtoArc from Federico, it&rsquo;s been in the back of my mind as one I&rsquo;d try if the MX Master 3S ever broke or became uncomfortable.</p>
