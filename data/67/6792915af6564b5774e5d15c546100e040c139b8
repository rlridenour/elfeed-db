If you ever wonder how to plot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">ER diagrams</a> in plain text, you may have already heard of <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/erd">erd</a>.
It&#39;s a cool command line program written by Andrew Gallant in Haskell, to &#34;compile&#34; plain text files into nicely looking images,
leveraging the power of <a href="https://graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>.</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve used erd for some time, it&#39;s cool and the syntax is quite simple.
It&#39;s also quite simple to install it on Linux, just install GraphViz and erd itself,
by following the instructions in the README page.</p>
