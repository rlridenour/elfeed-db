<p>One&#39;s own is well hidden for one&#39;s own; and of all treasure troves, one&#39;s own is the last to be excavated ….</p>
<p>
Friedrich Nietzsche, <em>Alzo sprach Zarathustra</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The importance of self-knowledge for managers and everybody else has been acknowledged through the ages and across cultures. A visitor to the temple of Apollo at Delphi in ancient Greece was commanded to “Know Thyself”, and Chinese philosopher Lao wrote that “self-knowledge is enlightenment”.</p>
<p>
Thousands of years later, the search for the real self is still central to the human experience. Contemporary management thinkers also recognise the importance of self-knowledge and have linked it to improved management performance and subsequently the success of the organisation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> Self-knowledge is different from knowledge of the objective world.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>
It is, by definition, subjective and is thus not easily obtained, as illustrated by the epigraph. Sigmund Freud and Carl Rogers, two of the most influential psychotherapists of the last century, theorised that people have a <a href="https://horizonofreason.com/science/hidden-personality/">hidden personality</a> of which they are not aware. It is this unknown, subconscious, nature of personality that creates epistemological hurdles and makes self-knowledge a hidden treasure.</p>

Psychometric Testing
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The holy grail of human resource management is to find the perfect staff member. Countless books are devoted to the recruitment process and predicting performance based on interviews, résumés, reference checks and psychometric testing. At Lucid Manager we have written several articles about the machinations of recruitment.</p>
<p>
The main problem with this approach is that the balance of power is presumed to be on the recruiter&#39;s side. This unbalanced relationship forces the applicant to be like a dancing monkey, performing the tricks that he or she believes will please the recruiters. The applicant is often left to second-guessing the &#39;right&#39; answer to the questions. And although we are often told that there are no right or wrong answers, this is of course not correct. Some answers get you the job and the ones that don&#39;t. The recruitment process is a case of double deception, both the recruiter and the applicant are not willing to have a genuine conversation because they are limited by the script of the traditional
job interview.</p>
<p>
Many different types of psychometric tests have been developed to determine a subject&#39;s personality or other aspects of the self. It seems that self-knowledge for managers is only a few tickboxes away. These tests are used in clinical settings and research but are also widely used for <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/deception-in-recruitment/">recruitment</a> and leadership development.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>
For my <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/tags/mba/">MBA studies</a>, I was asked to undertake a battery of personality and motivation tests in an attempt to improve my self-knowledge. The central question to be answered is whether this myriad of numbers and classifications describe me as a person and whether they can provide deeper self-knowledge to enable me to be a better manager.</p>
<p>
Numerous studies have shown that psychometric tests can be used to make predictions about the behaviour of individuals and job performance. There are, however, many situational variables, such as organisational culture, which influence behaviour. Research indicates that personality plays the most significant role in situations where there are no social clues on how to behave.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>
Some of the often used methodologies are scientifically problematic. There is little empirical evidence to confirm the validity of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbti">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a>. Also for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X">Theory X/Y</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Alderfer">ERG Theory</a>, there is little or no evidence to verify the validity of their assumptions.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup> A problematic aspect of self-administered psychometric testing is a high level of inherent confirmation bias, also known as the `<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effect">Forer Effect</a>&#39;.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>
Am I very conscientious, or do I perceive myself to be conscientious? Am I an extroverted person, or is it my high level of energy which subjugates any innate introverted personality? Do the results of these tests provide a picture of my inner self, or are they a reflection of my perceived self?</p>
<p>
The test results do not reveal any information beyond what has been entered by me, because the results are only a linguistic rearrangement of the answers. This idea is confirmed by recent research that showed that most people could guess the outcome of personality tests without actually undertaking them.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup></p>

Self-Knowledge for Managers
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Comprehensive self-knowledge can thus not be obtained by completing surveys because they can only reveal the perceived self and are not capable of unearthing the inner (subconscious) self. Psychometric tests are suitable only as a vehicle for introspection, providing an entry point for reflecting on one&#39;s self. This introspection can, however, not occur without life experience to reflect on.</p>
<p>
Obtaining self-knowledge, considered essential for leadership development, requires something more profound and more substantial, as alluded to by Nietzsche in the epigraph to this blog entry. As situational variables predominately control our behaviour, the only way to obtain self-knowledge is life-experience.</p>
<p>
Only by being exposed to a multitude of situations and challenges can we know what our personality is. As we gain life experience, our inner and perceived selves slowly converge. Maturity is the situation where the inner self and the perceived self are almost identical, and self-knowledge becomes apparent. Even the most carefully designed personality test can not leapfrog the knowledge obtained through life experience. Carl Gustav Jung, who inspired the development of the MBTI recognised this when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who wants to know the human psyche … would be better advised to abandon exact science … and wander with human heart through the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This foray into psychometric testing leaves me to conclude that no psychometric test can ever replace the fullness of life experience to obtain true self-knowledge. Experiences such as exposing oneself to challenging situations, occasionally exploring the boundaries of morality, experiencing different cultures or going through emotional turmoil are the only meaningful ways to gain self-knowledge.</p>
