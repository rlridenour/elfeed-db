</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Walking through the mental geography of what I&rsquo;ve read along with the serendipity of exploration.
</p>
        <p>Through my reading rolled the term <em>inner library</em>: the collection of
books/stories that we carry within us.  I’ve read several hundred books,
thousands of blog posts, numerous short-stories, graphic novels, and so forth.</p>
<p>And Tolkien dominates my <em>inner library</em>.  Not that I’ve read Tolkien so very
often but because, as Terry Pratchet once quipped:</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="jrr-tolkien-has-become-a-sort-of-mountain">
<p>
J.R.R. Tolkien has become a sort of mountain, appearing in all subsequent
fantasy in the way that Mt. Fuji appears so often in Japanese prints. Sometimes
it’s big and up close. Sometimes it’s a shape on the horizon. Sometimes it’s not
there at all, which means that the artist either has made a deliberate decision
against the mountain, which is interesting in itself, or is in fact standing on
Mt. Fuji.
</p>
<footer>&#8213; Terry Pratchett</footer></blockquote>
<p>Fantasy was mostly what I read during the first 40 years of life; long
dominating and thus itself full of echoes of Tolkien.</p>
<p>I’m working to curate that <em>inner library</em>; finding more women voices, as well as
those of other cultures and frames.  I want this <em>inner library</em> that I carry to
be broad and interesting.  To move me further towards empathy and understanding;
to help me gain access to more of myself.</p>
<p>I wrote Twenty Books that Have Stayed with Me; those are the front-faced books
of that library.  Below is a reproduction of that list, though not the reasons:</p>

<p>I chuckle as Nan Shephard’s <cite data-id="219EDD96-3C39-4CD5-9CB1-AA296408909D">The Living Mountain</cite> is almost certainly not
influenced by Tolkien nor influenced Tolkien<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> Written around the time of the release of <a href="work:ad1e6319-b4f2-4f00-b94f-1ac0834018ab">«The Hobbit»</a>, set aside for

.  It is about Shephard living
amongst the Cairngorm mountains of Scotland.  Yet a mountain looms.</p>
<p>And Rebecca Solnit’s <cite data-id="A6E49A97-C58B-44B3-A755-1CA627C0B8E5">Wanderlust</cite>, and its details of the social power of
walking, reinforcing the only path available to Frodo…to walk and walk.</p>
<p>Tolkien permeates.  Yet, his early desires (see Other Hands) were for others to
join in his sub-creation.  Copyright and estate management blocks that
possibility; but Tolkien showed his work, in that he drew upon the myriad of
older stories.  Giving shape to something mythical and adding to those
foundations.</p>
<p>And its not just the fantastical of Tolkien, there’s wordsmithing, connecting
oldness to present; walking with us as we explore a world (of myth) that could
almost be.  Of trees and flowers, stone and fungus, poem and the chain mail
song.  A world alive.</p>
<p>As I look to that list, I see clearly that I’m interested in myth making.  That
is being in conversations with our myths.  And my desire to broaden my reading
is recognizing that I want a more robust <em>inner library</em>; a deeper connection to a
broader world.  To hear the folklore that feed our world.  Knowing that often
women were the keepers of that folklore; yet it was often men who codified them.</p>
<p>And is that codification much like a dissection?  The subject is, at first,
alive, then very much not.</p>
<p>I once asked a well-read friend if I should read Proust, he chuckled and said
“Maybe, though I suspect you’ve read enough dead white guys.”  I don’t know if
I’ll get around to Proust, but I’m intrigued.</p>
<p>And on that I note, I was curious about what I’ve read (thus far) for <time datetime="2025" title="2025">2025</time>.  And
the majority, by my quick scan, are books by neither dead nor living white guys.</p>

<p>I tumble from interest to interest, often having two or three books running
concurrently.  And they interweave, tributaries that gather and fill the body of
water that is this <em>inner library</em>.</p>
<p>As I write this, I think of <cite data-id="55a32435-c012-4892-be9a-ac00b5b17204">Piranesi</cite> as most representative of that <em>inner
library</em>.  Large statues—Tolkienesque—fill the myriad of rooms.  Waters waters
flood and recede, bringing sustenance to the person inside.  Yet to remain there
is to forget and be lost to the world.  The titular character does find exit,
but also returns to draw comfort and understanding from this place of solitude.</p>
<p>Solitude.</p>
<p>On a lark at the library, I picked up <cite data-id="1f28328c-be96-453d-a9a8-9b921c39fd8a">The Little Book of Solitude</cite>,
which lead me to <cite data-id="fee4ffa7-1d45-46e7-86f1-af203b92f54b">Aflame</cite>, and reconnected me to Thich Nhat Hanh.</p>
<p>And how a conversation a few years ago in a bar drew my attention to Haruki
Murakami.  <cite data-id="588d8c62-e79a-4ffe-99f3-a73aba315a8e">Spring, Summer, Asteroid, Bird</cite> gave a frame to consider Murakami;
and <cite data-id="5dd8020b-640b-420d-ae24-84169585038c">To Fight Against this Age</cite> identified Kafka, by second-hand account, as
vital.  So I read my first Kafka novel: to understand Kafkaesque and to “unlock“
<cite data-id="kafka-on-the-shore-by-haruki-murakami">Kafka on the Shore</cite>.</p>
<p>Throughout <time datetime="2025" title="2025">this year</time> of reading—books and otherwise—names keep resurfacing:
Alice Walker, Audre Lorde, George Orwell, Hannah Arendt, Henry David Thoreau,
Toni Morrison, Ursula K Le Guin, and Václav Havel to name a few.</p>
<p>For reading I’m not setting down a curriculum, knowing that my interests flow
organically; and it is from there serendipity.  And for myself, I can most
easily find serendipity, looking at the neighbors of books I’ve found
interesting.</p>
<p>It was my library’s community read schedule <cite data-id="ISBN-9780199567690">Babbitt</cite> and two other Sinclair
Lewis books, that left me scratching my head.  Three Sinclair Lewis books?  Then
having read <cite data-id="ISBN-9780199567690">Babbitt</cite> I could see why.  I also learned that Tolkien drew
inspiration from <cite data-id="ISBN-9780199567690">Babbitt</cite> in creating Bilbo Baggins and Hobbits in general.</p>
<p>Serendipity.</p>
