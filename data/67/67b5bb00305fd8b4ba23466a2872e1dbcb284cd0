For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://shop.astropad.com">Astropad</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, and one of <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/collections/shop-astropad/products/rock-paper-pencil">Astropad's Rock Paper Pencil kits</a> to use with it.<br/>

Rock Paper Pencil makes writing on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; feel like writing on a piece of paper instead of a slippery display, and it makes for a much more comfortable and natural writing experience.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/collections/shop-astropad/products/rock-paper-pencil">&#36;45 Rock Paper Pencil kit</a> includes a NanoCling screen protector for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s display, and an accompanying &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; tip that replaces the stock &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; tip. You can put the NanoCling screen protector on while you're using your &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, then take it off and put it away for later if you want to use your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; without it. Putting the screen protector on and removing it again takes just seconds, and there's no sticky residue left behind on your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s screen.<br/>
<br/>

Earlier this year, Astropad made the Rock Paper Pencil kit even better. The Nanocling is thinner with an even more paper-like feel. Writing on it is like writing on a stack of papers rather than just a single sheet, and it's softer and smoother than before. Even though it has a unique microscopic texture that mimics the feel of paper, the screen protector doesn't interfere with the vivid colors of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s display.<br/>

Astropad also redesigned the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; tip that comes in the Rock Paper Pencil kit, and it's now made from solid stainless steel that won't wear down or chip over time. The size of the tip has also been increased, so it's now 1mm instead of 0.75mm. The larger tip balances out the friction and improves durability.<br/>
<br/>
If you dislike the slippery, unnatural feeling of writing on a hard screen, the Rock Paper Pencil is worth checking out. It can make you forget that you're writing on a tablet because it feels and sounds like using a pen on paper.<br/>

Rock Paper Pencil is compatible with all of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>, M3, and M4 iPads, and many older models as well. It works with the 6th and 7th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> and the 7th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and later.<br/>
