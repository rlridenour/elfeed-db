<p>In the December 2024 issue of <em>Recreational Mathematics Magazine</em>, Illinois State University mathematician Sunil Chebolu demonstrates that the digits of &#960; can be generated using the positions of stars.</p>
<p>The probability <em>P</em>(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) that two randomly chosen positive integers, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, are relatively prime is 6/&#960;<sup>2</sup>. The stars in the night sky appear to be distributed randomly on the celestial sphere, and this suggests a novel experiment: Use the pairwise angular distances between stars to simulate a large random sample of numbers, then pick random pairs and determine the proportion of relatively prime pairs. Equating that with the theoretical probability above should generate an approximation of &#960;.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232793432_Pi_in_the_sky"><em>Nature</em></a> in 1995, University of Aston mathematician Robert Matthews used the positions of 100 stars to compute &#960; to within 0.5% of its correct value (3.12772). By expanding the sample to 1,000 stars, Chebolu got an average estimate of 3.141540567, an error of less than 0.002%.</p>
<p>&#8220;The above method can also be viewed as a statistical hypothesis test,&#8221; Chebolu notes. &#8220;Since the error in the estimate for &#960; obtained using this method is pretty low, one may also argue that it supports the hypothesis that the bright stars are randomly distributed on the celestial sphere.&#8221;</p>
