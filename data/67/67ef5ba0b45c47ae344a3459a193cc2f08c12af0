<li>Little power banks about the size and thickness of a credit card</li>
<li>Okay, a bit thicker than a credit card</li>
<li>Includes cables for USB-C, Lightning and Micro USB</li>
<li>Not a ton of capacity, but good in a pinch</li>
<li>Are they Mac-compatible: We hope so, since we made this whole thing about the iPhone</li>
</ul><h1>Thin and Convenient</h1><p>According to <a href="https://www.getcasely.com/blogs/a/how-much-mah-to-charge-iphone?srsltid=AfmBOoo60ZIKYXJBvdawKXbCF4P2I5igSExRnYfuugMOcwUyE8Boaize">Casely</a>, an online phone case store that we’d definitely heard of ten minutes ago and have deemed an entirely trustworthy source of information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fast forward to the iPhone 15, equipped with a substantial 3349 mAh battery, ready to meet your power-hungry demands. To guarantee that your iPhone 15 remains charged and at your service, a power bank with a charge capacity of about 5023.5 mAh is the ideal companion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, one of these power cards won’t fully charge your iPhone 15 (which isn’t even the most recent iteration of the iPhone). In fact, it won’t even come close.</p>
<p>But what about an older model? Like, say, the iPhone 8?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ensure your iPhone 8 stays powered and ready to go, and select a power bank with the correct charge capacity. The iPhone 8, with its battery capacity of 1821 mAh, requires a power bank that can deliver around 2731.5 mAh to guarantee a complete charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, wow.</p>
<p>So, even a phone that came out more than five years ago wouldn’t be fully charged by one of these.</p>
<p>We don’t have the breakdown for Android phones, but we imagine it’s not too different: you’re unlikely to get a complete charge with one of these.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Or, well, the <em>things</em>. Two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>You get 4 of these. So, if you wanted to, you could carry multiple Charge Cards around with you (which wouldn’t be burdensome, considering their small size and easy-to-stash shape) to fully charge your newer phone. It would just involve swapping out banks a few times.</li>
</ol>
<p>And also…</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>These aren’t really ‘fully charge your phone on a TransAtlantic flight’ power banks. They’re really more like ‘keep your phone alive when there’s a delay along your public transit route’ power banks. Especially because you can charge one up, put it in your wallet, and then forget about it until you need it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point is: these things are useful, even if one can’t fully charge a phone.</p>
<p>So get one! And by one, we mean four.</p>
