<p>Ryan&#8217;s philosophical interests were mainly on questions related to freedom and determinism. He joined the faculty at Perimeter College in 2016. Before that, he held appointments at Miami Dade College and Clemson University. He earned his PhD from the University of Miami and his BA from Grand Valley State University.</p>
<p>In addition to his academic work and teaching, Ryan dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to popularizing philosophy.</p>
<p>His main channel for this was his philosophical comic strip, <a href="https://chaospet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Chaospet</em></a>, which he started in 2007 and which I was fortunate to be able to publish for several years at <em>Daily Nous</em>, beginning in 2015. You can view those comics <a href="https://dailynous.com/tag/chaospet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. He also created a set of philosophy <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@xaospet?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videos</a> on TikTok.</p>
<p>Ryan <a href="https://humanities.as.miami.edu/academic-programs/david-john-ruggiero-award/past-winners/2012-2013-winners/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended</a> a version of compatibilism, yet a recurring theme of his comics was the absurdity of human agency, responsibility, and valuing in a mechanical and indifferent universe.</p>

<p>For Ryan, the absurdity of our condition also included the human capacity, or perhaps need, to grasp for the silver lining in what seem like metaphysically or epistemically undesirable conditions.  <a href="https://dailynous.com/2017/09/12/chaospet-daily-nous-philosophy-comics-27/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-17495 aligncenter" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lake-2017-9-12-meaning.png" alt="" width="800" height="1051" srcset="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lake-2017-9-12-meaning.png 1000w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lake-2017-9-12-meaning-228x300.png 228w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lake-2017-9-12-meaning-768x1008.png 768w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lake-2017-9-12-meaning-780x1024.png 780w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/lake-2017-9-12-meaning-400x525.png 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>

<p>And of course he did not exempt his own way of grappling with the human condition from his ironic lens.</p>
