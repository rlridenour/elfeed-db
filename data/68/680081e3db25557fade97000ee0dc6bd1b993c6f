Here are the six apps included with an Apple Creator Studio subscription:<ul><li>Final Cut Pro on the Mac and iPad</li><br/>
<li>Logic Pro on the Mac and iPad</li><br/>
<li>Pixelmator Pro on the Mac and iPad</li><br/>
<li>Motion on the Mac</li><br/>
<li>Compressor on the Mac</li><br/>
<li>MainStage on the Mac</li></ul>Pixelmator Pro was previously only available on the Mac, but it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/pixelmator-pro-is-coming-to-ipad/">coming to the iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Creator Studio subscribers will also receive access to exclusive AI features and premium content across not only the Final Cut Pro and Pixelmator Pro apps, but also the iWork apps Numbers, Pages, and Keynote, and the Freeform app later this year. So if you want the best, fully-featured versions of all of these apps going forward, you will need to subscribe to the bundle.<br/>

In the Pixelmator Pro app on the Mac and iPad, for example, Apple Creator Studio subscribers will get access to a new Warp tool for twisting and shaping image layers. And in the Numbers, Pages, and Keynote apps, an Apple Creator Studio subscription will unlock a Content Hub with royalty-free photos, premium templates, themes, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says there will be separate Creator Studio and one-time purchase "versions" of each app. If you have both versions installed on your Mac, the Creator Studio versions will have "unique icons" so that they stand out, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Creator Studio will be available through the App Store starting Wednesday, January 28. All new subscribers will be able to receive a one-month free trial, and customers who purchase a new Mac or a qualifying iPad model with an A16, A17 Pro, or M-series chip or later will be eligible for an extended three-month free trial.<br/>
<br/>
For college students, Apple Creator Studio costs &#36;2.99 per month or &#36;29.99 per year. <br/>
<br/>
If you set up Family Sharing, you can share an Apple Creator Studio subscription with up to five other family members with a linked Apple Account for free.<br/>
<br/>
Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage will each remain available for one-time purchase, and free versions of the Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and Freeform apps will continue to exist. However, only Apple Creator Studio subscribers will receive access to some of the premium new AI features and content.<br/>
