<p>As OmniFocus went through its SwiftUI transition leading up to version 4, I heard from a lot of readers who were impatient with the slow upgrade. That is no longer a problem. Now that OmniFocus is firmly in SwiftUI, updates are coming quickly.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omnifocus-4.7-now-available">Version 4.7</a> added an entirely new data type, “Planning” Dates, which I&#8217;m still trying to wrap my head around for how I&#8217;m going to use. They also added the ability to create mutually exclusive tags like prioritization and energy level assignment. Repeat functionality has also become easier.</p>



<p>Then, while I was finishing up this post, OmniFocus lapped me <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/ready-for-os-26">and released version 4.8</a>, which modernizes the app for Liquid Glass and adds Foundation Model support for Artificial Intelligence right inside OmniFocus. So you could make a new project and have the AI structure take steps for you. Keep it up, Omni Group.</p>
