<p>John McCoy, on the supposedly controversial Cracker Barrel rebranding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But just because I doubt that these choices were motivated by
politics doesn’t mean the detractors don’t have a point: something
basic is being lost here. In both cases the companies have
discarded character and context in an effort to streamline their
identity. <a href="https://johnmccoy.org/2016/05/12/give-us-those-nice-bright-colors-give-us-the-greens-of-summer/">I have written previously</a> about the often
misguided penchant art directors have towards simplifying their
brands. I suspect that the lion’s share (ha) of this tendency is
simply following trends, and the current fashion in corporate
design is simple, flat typography and short (often single-word)
brand names. To the extent that someone actually gave this a
thought, the rationale is to remove any attributes that might
complicate a consumer’s attitude towards the brand. It also
reflects the desire of new executives to mark their territory by
peeing on it — see <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/branding-experts-max-renamed-hbo-max-1236399788/">HBO’s constant rebranding</a>, or Elon
Musk <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcuscollins/2023/07/30/the-real-lesson-to-be-learned-from-twitters-rebrand/">destroying the only part of Twitter that had any
value</a>, its name recognition.</p>

<p>If you want to be charitable, and I try to be when I can, the move
towards brand simplification also reflects a longstanding adage in
design — be it visual art, design, writing, or engineering: “less
is more.” This saying, often misattributed to Mies van der Rohe,
emphasizes clarity and utility. The goal is to focus on what is
essential. Practitioners of this belief make outsized claims about
the effects of this approach.</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2025/08/the-relentless-drive-toward-simplified-design/">via Jason Snell at Six Colors</a>, and, on the presumption that all of you have the good sense to read Six Colors regularly, I’d let you encounter McCoy’s post there, but for my need to make a few side points, gleaned from Threads:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The “controversy” is regarding the removal of the Uncle Herschel mascot (the <a href="https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/ezbx27y">cracker</a>) and the barrel. But <a href="https://www.threads.com/@jw/post/DN0oNKqYtO_">Josh Williams argues</a> that the lettering itself is nicely done in the new mark, and I agree. But I also agree with McCoy’s larger point that minimalistic rebrandings are simply trendy and Cracker Barrel is <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1959366015382589502">very late to the trend</a>, which, like all trends, will surely soon reverse.</p></li>
<li><p>That it’s a controversy at all <a href="https://www.threads.com/@spleenyone/post/DNsmnCf4sfx">is the work of activist investor Sardar Biglari</a>, CEO of midwest chain Steak ’n Shake. (Biglari’s father was a general under the Shah of Iran, and the family had to flee after the revolution.) Biglari has been trying to take over Cracker Barrel, Carl Icahn corporate-raider-style, for 15 years. That’s why Steak ’n Shake has been <a href="https://x.com/SteaknShake/status/1958956619070677489">stoking the supposed controversy about Cracker Barrel on its X account</a>. And Steak ’n Shake, under Biglari’s leadership, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/forwardsfromgrandma/comments/1m9s3wz/whats_been_going_on_with_steak_n_shake/">has been all-in as a MAGA brand</a> whilst <a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/story/evolving-steak-n-shake-has-closed-200-locations-since-2018/">closing over 200 restaurants in the last 7 years</a>. You can like or dislike the Cracker Barrel rebranding, but it’s not “woke”. It’s just minimal. The idea that it’s “woke” is just nonsense promulgated by Biglari to get the result we’re actually seeing, where pro-Trump media outlets (like Fox News) pick up on the rebranding as somehow “woke”, Cracker Barrel gets bad publicity and their stock price suffers, and maybe Biglari gets a chance to take over the chain, which is all he cares about.</p></li>
