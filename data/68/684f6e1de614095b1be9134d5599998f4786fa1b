<p>This is the eighth post in the <a href="/blog/fastmail-advent-2024/">Fastmail Advent 2024</a> series. The previous post was <a href="/blog/revision-of-core-email-specifications/">Dec 7: Revision of the core email specifications</a>. The next post is <a href="/blog/building-a-blog/">Dec 9: Building a blog</a>.</p><p>When it’s a week before December and you suddenly remember “oh yeah, we were going to do an advent blog series” — it does help to have some pre-written material! So I’m cheating a bit and pulling from our internal Notion, getting the words we’ve already spent a bunch of time honing.</p><p>I wrote last Sunday about our <a href="/blog/mission-statement/">Mission Statement</a>. A mission statement is all well and good, but it’s very high level and aspirational. It needs to be distilled down to something that’s actionable and useful on a daily basis.</p><p>So we wrote the following:</p><h2 id="our-guiding-principles" tabindex="-1">Our guiding principles</h2><p>How we go about achieving that vision is also very important to who Fastmail is as a company. We feel these principles really capture how Fastmail has operated as a company in the past, and should do in the future.</p><blockquote> <h3 id="we-are-a-good-internet-citizen" tabindex="-1">We are a good internet citizen</h3> <ul> <li>We believe in open protocols, standards and interoperability.</li> <li>We build, share, and support technology to make email better for everyone, not another walled garden.</li> <li>We foster positive relationships with our customers, partners, suppliers, and staff.</li> </ul> </blockquote><p>This is also one of our <a href="/company/values/">public values</a>. We encourage our employees to contribute to open source projects, to be involved in the technical communities in their local area, and to be involved in the standards development process.</p><blockquote> <h3 id="we-build-the-future" tabindex="-1">We build the future</h3> <ul> <li>We are not content to just accept the status quo.</li> <li>If the right tool doesn’t exist, we make it.</li> <li>If the open standards aren’t good enough, we improve them.</li> <li>We are leaders in our industry.</li> </ul> </blockquote><p>Yes, we’re a bit “not invented here”. We maintain the <a href="https://cyrusimap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyrus IMAP</a> server. We built our own <a href="https://github.com/fastmail/overture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Javascript framework</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fastmail/Squire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email editor</a>. We buy our own hardware made to spec for what we need, and manage everything from the operating system up.</p><p>We like to make things ourselves, because then we understand how they work; which leads into the next point!</p><blockquote> <h3 id="we-seek-understanding" tabindex="-1">We seek understanding</h3> <ul> <li>We are curious about how things work, and how they came to be.</li> <li>We seek deep and actionable understanding of our systems.</li> <li>We recognise that we can’t understand everything, but strive to know where the boundaries of our knowledge lie.</li> </ul> </blockquote><p>We really don’t like unexplained behaviours in our system. If we don’t know why it happened, that’s a problem! It’s this attitude which led us (see the past point) to <a href="/blog/twoskip-and-more/">debug and then replace the skiplist database format in Cyrus</a>.</p><p>We’re not writing our own filesystem or operating system though! At least not this week.</p><blockquote> <h3 id="we-value-discussion" tabindex="-1">We value discussion</h3> <ul> <li>We reach agreement through constructive, iterative collaboration.</li> <li>Everyone is encouraged to express their theories, and explain the basis on which they are formed.</li> <li>We test our assumptions against the real world.</li> <li>What works is more important than who thought of it.</li> </ul> </blockquote><p>We really believe in confirming theories against reality. Nothing beats a good hypothesis, and a well constructed experiment to determine whether it adequately predicted what happens.</p><hr><p>These principles really do reflect how we think and talk about ourselves at Fastmail. We live by these every day.</p><p>There have been times when we have considered that we need an additional principle “We get shit done”, which is in a degree of opposition to both “seek understanding” and “value discussion”. That’s the thing with principles like this, they are a tradeoff between different valuable properties. These are the ones we choose to prioritize! So we discuss, we understand, then we do.</p>
