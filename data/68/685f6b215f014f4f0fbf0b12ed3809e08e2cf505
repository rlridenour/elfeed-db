<p>Celebrate your Mac with the Eternal Storms Software Productivity Bundle &mdash; a collection of four awesome Mac apps, at one great discounted price!</p>

<p>It includes the following critically acclaimed apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Yoink: A &ldquo;file shelf&rdquo; that makes drag-and-drop a whole lot easier: just drag a file or app-content like images from a website to the edge of your screen, and Yoink gives you a temporary shelf to place them in, so you&rsquo;re free to navigate to their final destination on your disk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ScreenFloat: Your Screen Capture All-Rounder. From floating screenshots that help you keep things in mind, over iCloud-synced storage, organization, and vast editing and annotation capabilities, to OCR and QR-code recognition and more, if you take screenshots or record your screen, it might become your new best friend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transloader: Start downloads on your Mac, remotely from your iPhone, iPad, and other Macs. No more emailing yourself links, or weird AirDrop workarounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DeskMat: Cover up the mess on your Desktop, for cleaner streams, video conferencing, screen sharing, and distraction-free work!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy your Mac even more, with apps that help you get stuff done!</p>
