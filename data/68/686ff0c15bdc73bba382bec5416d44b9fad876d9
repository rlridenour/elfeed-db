<p>I forgot to mention <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2025/05/staying-with-fosstodon/">in yesterday’s post</a> another way (apart from looking at the <a href="https://fedidb.com/servers">FediDB directory</a>) to check how much an instance is being used. That’s the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/instance/#activity"><code>activity</code> API call</a>. Running it on Fosstodon this morning via</p>
<pre><code>curl -s https://fosstodon.org/api/v1/instance/activity | jq
</code></pre>
<p>I got</p>
<pre><code>[
    {
        "week": "1748188656",
        "statuses": "1383",
        "logins": "2663",
        "registrations": "1"
    },
    {
        "week": "1747583856",
        "statuses": "16416",
        "logins": "6996",
        "registrations": "5"
    },
    .
    .
    .
    {
        "week": "1741535856",
        "statuses": "21653",
        "logins": "7844",
        "registrations": "24"
    }
]
</code></pre>
<p>The result was an array of 12 JSON objects, each with a week’s worth of activity.<sup id="fnref:months"><a href="#fn:months" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The <code>week</code> entry for each item is the Unix timestamp for the beginning of the week. Converting the first <code>week</code> value to a human-readable form through</p>
<pre><code>date -jr 1748188656
</code></pre>
<p>I got</p>
<pre><code>Sun May 25 10:57:36 CDT 2025
</code></pre>
<p>so the first set of activities represents only about a day, not a full week.</p>
<p>Running</p>
<pre><code>curl -s https://fosstodon.org/api/v1/instance/activity |\
jq '.[1:].[].logins | tonumber'
</code></pre>
<p>which omits the number of logins for the partial week, returns</p>
<pre><code>6996
7140
7212
7622
7498
7440
7490
7516
7666
7882
7844
</code></pre>
<p>So the activity on Fosstodon <em>has</em> gone down, and some of that may be due to the recent controversy. Let’s check this against <a href="https://hachyderm.io/about">Hachyderm</a>, an instance that I’ve always considered comparable to Fosstodon. Here,</p>
<pre><code>curl -s https://hachyderm.io/api/v1/instance/activity |\
jq '.[1:].[].logins | tonumber'
</code></pre>
<p>returns</p>
<pre><code>6531
6539
6651
6653
6579
6631
6735
6731
6786
7187
7223
</code></pre>
<p>so its logins have also gone down a bit over the past several weeks. Plotting both timelines, we get</p>
<p><img alt="Login timeline comparison" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2025/20250526-Login%20timeline%20comparison.png" title="Login timeline comparison" width="100%"/></p>
<p>So both instances have had an overall decline in logins over this period. The short-lived jump in Fosstodon logins four weeks ago might well have been due to the controversy.</p>
<p>Another way to compare the two sets of data is to plot the ratio of logins:</p>
<p><img alt="Ratio timeline" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2025/20250526-Ratio%20timeline.png" title="Ratio timeline" width="100%"/></p>
<p>There’s about a 7% variation in the ratio over this period, but it’s hard to argue for a trend. Certainly not an exodus from Fosstodon.</p>
<p>I should mention that “Weeks ago” is an imperfect scale because Fosstodon and Hachyderm start their weeks about a day apart. As we saw above, Fosstodon starts its week on Sunday morning (Chicago time); Hachyderm starts its week on Monday morning.</p>
<p>I suppose I could have compared the <code>statuses</code> data instead of <code>logins</code>, but I care more about the number of people checking their timelines than how much they’re posting. What’s nice is that the API gives you the information to compare either one.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:months">
<p>The docs say it returns three months worth of activity, so presumably sometimes it will return 13 objects instead of 12. <a href="#fnref:months" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
