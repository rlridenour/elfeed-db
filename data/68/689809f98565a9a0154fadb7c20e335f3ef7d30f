Apple has refreshed both tiers of its MacBook lineup in 2025, first updating the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> with the M4 chip and now introducing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> with the new M5 chip, so how do the latest models compare?<br/>

While the 13- and 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; continue to start at &#36;999 and &#36;1,199 respectively, moving to the 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; requires spending at least &#36;400 more. For some buyers, the extra cost is unnecessary; for others, the Pro's hardware advantages meaningfully change the experience in ways the Air cannot match even with higher configurations. Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two popular laptops is best for you. Beyond their chips, the key differences are as follows:<br/>

Dimensions are also a key area of difference between the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;. The &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is noticeably thicker and heavier than both &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models:<br/>

With the latest version of the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, Apple is touting the power of the M5 chip. Compared to the M4, it says the M5 is:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Up to <strong>15% faster</strong> multithreaded CPU performance</li><br/>
 <li>Up to <strong>30% faster</strong> overall graphics performance</li><br/>
 <li>Up to <strong>45% faster</strong> ray tracing performance</li><br/>
 <li><strong>27.5% higher</strong> unified memory bandwidth</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
In addition to general performance claims, Apple published a set of specific real-world workload results showing measurable gains in AI-driven applications:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>4×+</strong> peak GPU compute performance for AI </li><br/>
 <li><strong>3.6× faster</strong> time to first token (LLM)</li><br/>
 <li><strong>1.8× faster</strong> Topaz Video Enhance AI processing</li><br/>
 <li><strong>1.7× faster</strong> Blender ray-traced rendering</li><br/>
 <li><strong>2.9× faster</strong> AI speech enhancement in Premiere Pro</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Other notable changes compared to the M4 chip in the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; include:<br/>

Taken as a whole, the M4 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; continues to represent the most suitable choice for users whose workloads are light to moderate and who value portability and an affordable price over sustained performance. Its starting price of &#36;999, which is frequently reduced further through Apple education pricing and third-party promotions, places it within reach for the majority of buyers. For daily tasks like email, light productivity, browsing, and media consumption, it delivers performance that is effectively indistinguishable from more expensive models. Its thinner chassis, lower weight, and selection of color options also remain important advantages for many.<br/>

</ul><br/>
<br/>
By contrast, the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; exists for those whose work or expected longevity justifies the premium. The combination of a more advanced chip, mini-LED XDR display with ProMotion, active cooling for sustained performance headroom, a dedicated HDMI port with multichannel audio support, an SDXC card slot, a third Thunderbolt port, higher memory ceilings, larger storage options, improved speakers and microphones, and materially longer battery life produces a machine with materially different capabilities. If you expect to perform extended tasks in video editing, 3D workloads, software development, or AI-driven tasks, the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is designed to avoid the thermal and bandwidth constraints that the Air will encounter.<br/>
<br/>
A notable exception arises at the upper end of the Air's pricing. The 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; at &#36;1,299, and especially when configured to 512GB of storage at &#36;1,399, approaches the 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;'s &#36;1,599 entry point closely enough that the trade-off changes. For an increment of &#36;200–300, the Pro substitutes a significantly more advanced display, active cooling, six additional hours of battery life, superior speakers and microphones, an additional Thunderbolt port, and integrated HDMI and SDXC. In that specific pricing band, the Pro will likely constitute the stronger long-term purchase for the majority of buyers unless screen size or minimal weight are the overriding priorities.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-air-vs-m5-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Air vs. M5 MacBook Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-macbook-air-vs-m5-macbook-pro-buyers-guide.2469786/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
