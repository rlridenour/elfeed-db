<p>Dr. Kind was recognized for his article, &#8220;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-025-09589-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Faithful Response to the Comforting Delusion Objection</a>&#8220;, published in <em>Neuroethics</em>. The prize committee writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span dir="auto">Dr. Adrian Kind&#8217;s outstanding work represents a significant advance in knowledge for both philosophy and psychiatry, thus fully meeting the criteria for awarding the prize. Thematically, it addresses the critique of an aspect of psychotherapeutic treatments using psychedelic substances (such as psycholysis), where therapeutic success is sought through the induction of states of transcendence, such as mystical experiences of oneness.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span dir="auto">These therapies are predominantly viewed critically by the public, while research into them – after a prolonged hiatus – has recently increased again. The aspect that is often considered problematic, particularly from a philosophical perspective, is the irrationality of the beliefs that are accepted as a means to an end. The &#8220;comforting delusion&#8221; of drug-induced unio mystica may be &#8220;comforting,&#8221; but it remains a (transient) delusion. In this respect, it may not harm the patients&#8217; health, but it does harm their intellectual integrity and, potentially, their dignity as rational subjects. </span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span dir="auto">This work develops a profound, albeit limited in scope, meta-critique of this critique. It adopts the distinction between belief and faith from analytical philosophy of religion and argues that the induced states belong to the category of faith and are therefore incommensurable with the cognitive rationality criteria applicable to beliefs.</span></em></p>
<p>Ms. Nickel was recognized for her article, &#8220;Speech Is Silver, Listening Is Gold: Phenomenological Psychopathology in Dialogue with Epistemic Injustice.&#8221; The prize committee writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span dir="auto">In her work, Lea Nickel argues that psychiatric diagnostics must rely heavily on subjective statements from those affected, and that this poses a risk of epistemic injustice. She draws on Miranda Fricker&#8217;s (2007) concept that epistemic injustice affects us all as knowing subjects and can undermine our ability to participate in knowledge-making practices.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span dir="auto">As an alternative to the conventional approach, Nickel discusses phenomenological psychopathology as a potential method for addressing epistemic injustice. Phenomenological psychopathology values ​​the ego experiences of patients and recognizes their cognitive value. As a scientific method, it is suitable for reducing epistemic injustice. At the same time, it must itself be critically examined and further developed with regard to its own &#8220;blind spots&#8221; concerning epistemic injustice.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span dir="auto">Lea Nickel&#8217;s approach is systematic in its presentation of epistemic risks, thus connecting questions about the epistemological validity of psychiatric knowledge and the resulting ethical implications, employing philosophical terminology and methodology. She therefore also paves the way for a more just psychiatric practice that truly listens to those affected.</span></em></p>
