<p>I went back to Safari after I <a href="https://taonaw.com/2026/02/01/starting-to-get-annoyed-with.html">started to get annoyed with Zen</a> on my Mac, and so far, it&rsquo;s… fine.</p>
<p>Safari doesn&rsquo;t have all the bells and whistles Orion has, especially the vertical tabs<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, but it works. And here&rsquo;s the thing: I&rsquo;m always going to have Safari. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m going to uninstall Safari from my Mac if I&rsquo;m satisfied with another browser, because it&rsquo;s integrated into the OS in a way I shouldn&rsquo;t mess with, probably similar to how Internet Explorer (and then Edge) is with Windows.</p>
<p>So if Safari doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere, and sometimes, despite my best efforts, certain apps and links still open in Safari, I might as well use it. After all, it&rsquo;s not as bad as Internet Explorer was.</p>
<p>Safari is pretty basic. It doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of extensions compared to Chromium browsers and Firefox, that&rsquo;s for sure, but for the most part, what I need is there<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. It works smoothly and quickly without the kind of issues I&rsquo;ve noticed in both Zen (syncing, lack of codecs) and Orion (broken sidebar, privacy settings that can prevent websites from working properly).</p>
<p>See, since I have two computers - my Mac and my Linux desktop - I&rsquo;m not too worried about privacy or usability on Safari.</p>
<p>For Privacy, I have LibreWolf on Linux (which can no longer be installed without quarantine via Homebrew, prevents it from lunching), and for work productivity, I use Edge anyway, since we&rsquo;re a Microsoft workplace. It&rsquo;s Edge where I need some serious tab management, and it&rsquo;s there where I have it.</p>
<p>Safari is my place for watching Netflix and YouTube, checking my bank statements, and running quick searches with Kagi. It&rsquo;s fine for that.</p>
<p>On Linux, Zen has become my browser of choice for &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stuff almost since I installed it. It always opens to my latest pages, it occupies a whole virtual desktop there, which is how it&rsquo;s meant to work, and for the most part, it delivers all that I need (I still need to switch to the Mac to watch something, but OK). With this arrangement, I think I&rsquo;m good for now.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p><sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> : Safari has vertical tabs… kind of. You can turn on the sidebar and see them, but then you have a sidebar just stuck there (can&rsquo;t auto-hide it), and there&rsquo;s not a lot of tab management you can do, especially when you compare it to Zen.</p>
<p><sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup>: I&rsquo;d like for KeePassXC to be working with Safari, but no such luck. I&rsquo;ve seen some paid solutions, but they&rsquo;re too expensive for my use case.</p>
