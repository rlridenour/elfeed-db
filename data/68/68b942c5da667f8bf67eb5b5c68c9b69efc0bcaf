<p>&#8220;Jottings&#8221; from the notebooks of Bulgarian novelist Elias Canetti, published as <a href="https://archive.org/details/humanprovince0000cane/page/n5/mode/2up"><em>The Human Province</em></a> (1978):</p>
<ul>
<li>The days are distinct, but the night has only one name.</li>
<li>A war always proceeds as if humanity had never hit upon the notion of justice.</li>
<li>The lowest man: he whose wishes have all come true.</li>
<li>The dead are nourished by judgments, the living by love.</li>
<li>If you have seen a person sleeping, you can never hate him again.</li>
<li>I really only know what a tiger is since Blake&#8217;s poem.</li>
<li>A nice trick: throwing something into the world without being pulled in by it.</li>
<li>The future, which changes every instant.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m fed up with seeing through people; it&#8217;s so easy, and it gets you nowhere.</li>
<li>In love, assurances are practically an announcement of their opposite.</li>
<li>In eternity, everything is at the beginning, a fragrant morning.</li>
<li>Praying as a rehearsal of wishes.</li>
<li>Why aren&#8217;t more people good <em>out of spite?</em></li>
<li>The best person ought not to have a name.</li>
<li>To keep thoughts apart by force. They all too easily become matted, like hair.</li>
<li>Each war contains all earlier wars.</li>
<li>One may have known three or four thousand people, one speaks about only six or seven.</li>
<li>You notice some things only because they&#8217;re not connected to anything.</li>
<li>Everyone ought to watch himself eating.</li>
<li>Nothing is more boring than to be worshiped. How can God stand it?</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Square tables: the self-assurance they give you, as though one were alone in an alliance of four.&#8221;</p>
