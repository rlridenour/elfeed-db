<blockquote>
  <p>This update includes enhancements to the Shortcuts app across all
platforms, including new intelligent actions and an improved
editing experience. Shortcuts on macOS now supports personal
automations that can be triggered based on events such as time of
day or when you take actions like saving a file to a folder, as
well as new integrations with Control Center and Spotlight.</p>
