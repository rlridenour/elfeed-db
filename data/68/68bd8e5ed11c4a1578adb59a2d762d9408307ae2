<p>The European Commission has opened a formal antitrust investigation into whether Google’s use of online content and YouTube videos to power its artificial intelligence services breaches EU competition rules and shortchanges publishers and creators. Regulators say they are examining how Google collects and uses material from news sites, other web publishers and YouTube uploads to train models behind products such as AI Overviews in search, the Gemini chatbot and AI Mode, and whether content providers receive appropriate compensation or a meaningful way to opt out. The inquiry will also assess whether Google’s control of YouTube could allow it to deny or disadvantage rival AI developers’ access to video data, potentially reinforcing its position in both search and generative AI markets. EU competition officials stress that they want innovation in AI to flourish, but insist it must develop in a way that respects fair competition and fundamental societal principles such as intellectual property and media pluralism.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/LJE3TpDvAtfK3jt5Ww5lFtdS9c26xoGh5UMVaSfaTYgRTbZclnunBWQPeeTD9_lm27lrjUz23gxYOZ_ip4hYM1rsiyRWaUJli5piN6KkNbxnYwiL0y0401-BLnnvnJBmuFCiWdOu4P6K9zg4wz2BVX9ZkTsZueBJy1a1oZ4Z5EtlfREXbJMeDVi6FJoHlRRtIQtsl8odV4tXrlQnAKoPFZwIrw' alt='European Commission vice president Teresa Ribera, who oversees competition policy, speaking in Brussels.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Focus on AI Overviews: Investigators are scrutinising whether Google’s AI Overviews, which place generated summaries above traditional search links, divert traffic from publishers whose articles supplied the underlying information without offering them comparable visibility or direct payment.</li><li>Gemini and AI Mode: The probe covers Google’s broader Gemini-based services, including AI Mode that provides conversational answers, to determine if training and response generation rely on third‑party content obtained under terms web publishers did not explicitly agree to for AI use.</li><li>Use of YouTube data: EU officials are examining whether videos uploaded to YouTube have been repurposed to train Google’s generative AI models on conditions that exclude competing AI developers from accessing similar data sets.</li><li>Legal framework chosen: The commission is pursuing the case under its traditional competition law framework rather than the newer Digital Markets Act, signalling that it sees the issues as potential abuse of dominance in specific markets rather than only a gatekeeper conduct question.</li><li>Timeline and next steps: Brussels has not set a deadline for the investigation and can eventually impose fines or binding behavioural remedies if it concludes that Google’s practices restrict competition or harm content providers in the internal market.</li></ul><blockquote>AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies - Teresa Ribera</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Commission: The commission says it wants to ensure that the way Google collects and uses content for AI does not undermine competition, intellectual‑property rights or media pluralism in the EU’s internal market.
