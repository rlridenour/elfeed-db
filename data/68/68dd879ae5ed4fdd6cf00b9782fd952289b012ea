<li>Bowls</li>
<li>Lined with freezable gel</li>
<li>Great for ice cream and also dips and other stuff</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but what if you mounted one on a plastic cactus? It would be the perfect margarita vessel!</li>
</ul><h1>Best Served Cold</h1><p>The marketing for these things says they’re bowls for keeping ice cream cold. And to be clear, they can definitely keep ice cream cold.</p>
<p>But they can also keep other stuff cold, too!</p>
<p>Like an array of dips at your cookout. Or some chopped-up vegetables to dip in those dips. Or some M&amp;Ms you bring outside to eat slowly in the afternoon sun. Or some gazpacho or a bit of mayo-based pasta salad or any other thing that starts to taste weird when its temperature gets any higher than ‘room.’</p>
<p>Or, hey, maybe you like to eat a cold bowl of cereal in the sauna. We won’t judge!</p>
<p>(Or, wait, scratch that. We will. We will judge ruthlessly. Because that’s disgusting. Don’t eat cereal in the sauna, you weirdo!)</p>
<p>Point is, they’re bowls that freeze. What you put in them is up to you.</p>
<p>But let’s say you are going to use them for ice cream. And let’s say you’re gonna eat said ice while projecting a film in your backyard.</p>
<p>Well, in such a case as that, we have a suggestion: why not cool things down even further by choosing a nice ice-cream movie to watch?</p>
<p>You know, something like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>12 Chunky Monkeys</em></li>
<li><em>The Rocky Road To Perdition</em></li>
<li><em>BenJerry Glenn Ross</em></li>
<li><em>Pistachio Brother, Where Art Thou</em></li>
<li><em>The Talenti Mr. Ripley</em></li>
<li><em>Chocolate Chip Cookie Doughn’t Tell Mom The Babysitter’s Dead</em></li>
<li><em>Neapoli-Tin Cup</em></li>
<li><em>Courage Under Breyer</em></li>
<li><em>Catch Me If You Butter Pecan</em></li>
<li><em>The Graeter Gatsby</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, these puns are pretty stupid, we know. But the bowls? They’re actually a little stupid, too.</p>
<p>But useful! Very, very useful!</p>
