<blockquote>
<p>A website called “DOGEQUEST” has posted on a searchable map what it claims to be the names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of Tesla owners across the United States, and says it will remove the data if an individual proves that they have sold their Tesla. The map also includes the addresses of Tesla dealerships, the rough locations of Tesla superchargers, and the personal information of employees of the Elon Musk-headed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d go as far as to say that it&rsquo;s good to see something opposing to the DOGE-ish takeover of the government, but not this way. People who own Tesla may or may not be supporters of Musk at the moment, and not everyone can just get up and sell their car. Besides, the information can be outdated, incorrect, or misleading - there&rsquo;s no way of telling (404 media themselves explain this)</p>

<p>Burn everything down and ask questions later. I understand the anger, but we can do better than this. Left or right, fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to the dark side. It matters not.</p>
