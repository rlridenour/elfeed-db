Apple said the 3D-printed titanium USB-C port offers three benefits compared to one manufactured with a conventional forging process: it is thinner, stronger, and uses 33% less material to be more environmentally friendly.<br/>
<br/>
3D printing for metal is also known as metal additive manufacturing, a process that involves creating objects layer by layer with powdered metal, based on a CAD model.<br/>
<br/>
Despite this manufacturing innovation, the iPhone Air's USB-C port is limited to outdated USB 2 speeds of up to 480 Mb/s for wired data transfer.<br/>
<br/>
Titanium cases for Apple Watch Ultra 3 and higher-end Apple Watch Series 11 models are also made with a 3D-printing process that uses half the raw material as previous generations of each device, according to Apple's announcements.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone Air can be pre-ordered starting this Friday at 5 a.m. Pacific Time, while the new Apple Watch models are available to pre-order now, in the U.S. and many other countries. All of the devices are set to launch Friday, September 19.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/11/iphone-air-3d-printed-usb-c-port/">iPhone Air Features 3D-Printed Titanium USB-C Port With Three Benefits</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-features-3d-printed-titanium-usb-c-port-with-three-benefits.2465333/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
