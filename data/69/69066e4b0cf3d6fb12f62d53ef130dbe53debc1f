Recruitment of new people or can be a stressful experience. Many organisations maintain extensive procedures to try to find the right person for the right job or even hire specialised <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/consultant-shaman/">consultants</a> to do the job for them. Why go through these troubles if there was a golden rule of recruitment?</p>
<p>
They ask strange questions that no reasonable person would ever dare to entertain: &#34;What are your three trademarks?&#34;, &#34;What are your biggest mistakes?&#34; or &#34;What is the meaning of life&#34; and &#34;What is the airspeed velocity of a laden swallow?&#34;. Some even resort to pseudo-scientific <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/free-personality-test/">personality testing</a> to throw some insights into these strangers across the table.</p>
<p>
The problem recruiters have is that it is a lot easier not to hire someone than to fire them later, which leads to complicated processes to reduce this risk. <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/deception-in-recruitment/">Job interviews are thus a bizarre environment</a> that often bears no resemblance to a real professional situation. The fear of taking a risk with a person and a lack of self-confidence in their people skills motivates recruiters to resort to pseudo-scientific tools and hiding behind bizarre interviewing techniques.</p>

The Golden Rule of Recruitment
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Particularly in a customer service related position a person&#39;s ability to <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/marketing/sociological-imagination-in-marketing/">understand customers</a> is more important than the results of a personality test or the answer to weird questioning. Asking irrelevant questions only motivates the applicant to bend the truth.</p>
<p>
Recruitment methods should as much as possible be normal human interaction as ultimately every company gets the
<a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/recruitment/">employees they deserve</a>. </p>
<p>
No matter how ritualised the interview process, the Golden Rule of Recruitment remains: You get the employees you deserve.</p>
