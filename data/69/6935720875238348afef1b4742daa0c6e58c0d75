<li>A mini circular saw and/or a mini chainsaw (choose one or both)</li>
<li>Great for little jobs that require big power</li>
<li>Rechargeable, so no gas smell</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: Maybe, but they’ll also make a mess in the process</li>
</ul><h1>Small but Mighty</h1><p>Here’s a little snippet from a 2022 CNN article titled, “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/us/skeleton-home-depot-skelly-halloween-decoration-trend-cec">How a 12-foot skeleton became the hottest Halloween decoration around</a>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fall beckons the arrival of the Home Depot skeleton, a massive Halloween yard decoration that first hit the market in 2020 and has captivated imaginations ever since. Affectionately known as Skelly, the looming figure is now a mascot of sorts for those who delight in the gothic excesses of Halloween decor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The piece goes on to discuss the product’s inception and its popularity, noting how people will “snatch up entire inventories in hours and spawn a whole skeleton black market in the process.”</p>
<p>And none of this is hyperbole. Anyone with eyes can confirm the Home Depot skeleton’s reach. Seriously, if you’ve got neighbors on either side, one behind you, and one across the street, there’s a pretty good chance you are 75% or even 100% surrounded by massive bony boys.</p>
<p>Crazy, right?</p>
<p>But you might be wondering why we’re talking about a Halloween decoration in early August when we’re selling a couple saws.</p>
<p>Well, it’s simple: if you see no issue with buying hokey holiday bullshit from a store known to sell serious home improvement products, then you shouldn’t worry about buying serious home improvement products from a brand that usually supplies hokey bullshit around the holidays.</p>
<p>But just to be clear, these <em>are</em> slightly hokey. As in, they’re <em>mini</em> saws.</p>
<p>You get a little handheld circular saw that is good for cutting wood, metal, or plastic. And(/or) you get a little handheld chainsaw that’s great for pruning and gardening.</p>
<p>And sure, the miniature size is a bit of a gimmick, but you also know there are times you’ll be glad to have these things.</p>
<p>Like, say, if a big branch comes off a tree in a storm, the kind that’s too thick to break down by hand, but not big enough to require a full-blown chainsaw. Sure, you could use a hacksaw, but even that’s going to take a while. One of these, on the other hand, would be perfect for the job without feeling like overkill.</p>
<p>Or you could–</p>
<p>Well, let’s try this. Why don’t <em>you</em> tell <em>us</em> what you’d use these saws for in the comments. After all, we could sit around, spitballing hypotheticals, but you probably have actual ideas or even real situations that come to mind.</p>
<p>Or you could just buy them without commenting at all. We don’t mind that either.</p>
