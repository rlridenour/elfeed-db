<p>Six Colors contributor Shelly Brisbin has <a href="https://www.iosaccessbook.com/ios-18-edition-released/">just updated</a> her longtime, definitive book about accessibility features in iOS:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m pleased to announced that <em>iOS Access for All (iOS 18 edition</em>) is available now. As usual, there is more information than ever before. The book is fully updated for iOS 18 and the new iPhones and iPads that support it….</p>
<p>  iOS 18 marks some incremental, but welcome upgrades to accessibility features, and to iOS as a whole. It also brings Apple Inteligence to the latest generation of phones. It’s all included, along with coverage of a number of updates Apple has made to iOS since first releasing iOS 18 last fall.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The book is <a href="https://www.iosaccessbook.com/buy/">available in ePub and PDF versions</a> and there’s a forthcoming version with no images, too. $25 from the Apple Books store or a $30 all-formats bundle direct from Shelly.</p>
