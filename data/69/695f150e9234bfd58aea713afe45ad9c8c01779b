<p>Japan restarted one reactor at the seven-unit Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power station in Niigata on January 21, marking TEPCO’s first reactor restart since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The move reflects Japan’s push to bolster energy security and cut reliance on fossil fuels as it pursues carbon neutrality by 2050, while also trying to meet rising electricity demand tied to AI growth. The restart has revived safety concerns and left local opinion divided, with protests reported near the site.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/id0jbcUw9Vrg8G_hxB9hJU_h34hecpTjR_Wec-Er8MQ70mTrqnSEW66vO6FXVWC5ANAAhWm6F7FkgcZTSZ7aAJG1wm8b0Rf4tCWoGfrWtCTK' alt='TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant Unit 6 in Niigata Prefecture (Dec. 2, 2025).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Local approval: Niigata’s regional governor cleared the restart last month, but a September survey cited in reports found residents split, with a majority opposed.</li><li>Safety scrutiny: TEPCO said it would verify each facility’s integrity and address issues “appropriately and transparently,” as it brings Unit 6 back online.</li><li>Post-2011 context: Kashiwazaki-Kariwa was shut after Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power following the earthquake-and-tsunami-triggered Fukushima meltdowns, and this restart adds to the broader reopening trend under tightened rules.</li><li>Global nuclear pace: Semafor linked Japan’s restart to a wider nuclear revival, noting the UK is extending the life of a major reactor, China is building dozens of units on roughly five-year timelines, and the US is building none.</li><li>Economic debate: Commentary cited in The Week argued that running reactors can help lower electricity bills and reduce the cost of maintaining idle plants, while opponents near Kashiwazaki-Kariwa frame the risks as unacceptable.</li></ul><blockquote>It’s Tokyo’s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk?
