         
         <p>This is a simple package to automatically preview in a window the file
at point in Dired buffers. Preview windows are closed when they are no
longer relevant, while preview buffers are killed if they have not
been used for other purposes beside previewing. The package provides
several customisation options to control its behaviour.</p>

<h2>Version 0.6.0 on 2025-07-18</h2>

<p>This is a small release that provides quality-of-life refinements.</p>

<h3>Optionally do not trigger a preview when entering the directory</h3>

<p>The new user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-preview-trigger-on-start</code> controls whether
a preview is produced automatically when (i) entering a directory
while (ii) the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-preview-mode</code> or its global counterpart is
enabled.</p>

<p>The default value is non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, which preserves the behaviour we have
always had of previewing outright. When set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, the preview does
not happen upon entering a directory and is triggered only after one
of the commands in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-preview-trigger-commands</code> is invoked.</p>

<p>I did this is in response to issue 31 by dasoju: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/issues/31">https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/issues/31</a>.</p>

<h3>Define which commands trigger a preview</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-preview-trigger-commands</code> is now declared as a “user
option” rather than a generic variable, meaning that users are
encouraged to customise it (and it technically is available via the
Custom interface and related). Everything should otherwise work the
same as before.</p>

<h3>The preview does not interfere with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-dwim-target</code></h3>

<p>Previous versions would make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-dwim-target</code> not return the
directory of the other window. Whereas we want the preview to not
influence how Dired behaves when copying or renaming files.</p>

<p>The bug was addressed in patch release <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.5.2</code>.</p>

<h3>Fixed a temporary bug in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired-preview-page-up</code></h3>

<p>It was missing the macro we define to perform operations in the
preview window.</p>

<p>Thanks to Alex Popescu for telling me that the command was not
working. This was done in issue 28: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/issues/28">https://github.com/protesilaos/dired-preview/issues/28</a>.</p>

<p>The bug was addressed in patch release <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.5.1</code>.</p>
