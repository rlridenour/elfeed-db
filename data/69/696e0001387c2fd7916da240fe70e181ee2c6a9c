With Sound Recognition, HomePod can detect the sound of a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm in your home, and alert you by sending a notification to your iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch.  <br/>
<br/>
It's a neat addition if you don't own a smart detector, although Apple warns that the feature should not be relied upon "in circumstances where users may be harmed or injured," or in "high-risk or emergency situations."<br/>
<br/>
The Sound Recognition feature is accessible in the Home app. If your Home system is connected to a smart camera, it will also display live video of your home, so you can see what's happening in real time. <br/>
<br/>
Here's how to enable the feature. Note that Sound Recognition on HomePods requires Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/update-apple-home-app-by-tomorrow/">updated Home app architecture</a> that was introduced in 2022 as part of iOS 16.4 and iPadOS 16.4.<br/>
<ol><li>In the Home app, tap the <strong>ellipsis button</strong> (three dots) in the top-right corner of the screen.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Home Settings</strong>.<br/>
