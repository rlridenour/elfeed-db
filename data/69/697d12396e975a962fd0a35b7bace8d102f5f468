<p id="p2">Yesterday, Apple announced a couple of new features that are now available in the Maps app.</p>
<p id="p3">The first is a new label that&rsquo;s been added to restaurants and hotels in the U.S., which have been awarded MICHELIN distinctions. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-brings-insights-ratings-and-reviews-from-expert-sources-to-apple-maps/" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Apple&rsquo;s press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  Users can now view and search for MICHELIN-starred, Green Star, and Bib Gourmand restaurants &mdash; along with MICHELIN Key hotels &mdash; starting in the U.S., with support for additional regions coming in the future.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">The new MICHELIN integration also allows users to filter based on MICHELIN ratings and make restaurant reservations and book hotels through the MICHELIN Guide app. Apple says additional rankings and guides will be available soon from The Infatuation and Golf Digest, with more sources coming later. You&rsquo;ll also be able to book tee times on golf courses using Supreme Golf.</p>

<p id="p7">For F1 fans, Apple has given Monaco the a special Detailed City Experience that&rsquo;s designed for people attending Formula 1 TAG Heuer Grand Prix de Monaco 2025 as well as fans following along from home.</p>
<p id="p8">On its UK press site, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2025/05/apple-maps-brings-a-detailed-city-experience-to-formula-1-grand-prix-de-monaco/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple announced that</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote9"><p>
  The new Detailed City Experience features custom-designed 3D Mon&eacute;gasque landmarks of iconic locations, including Casino de Monte-Carlo, Fairmont Monte Carlo, H&ocirc;tel de Paris Monte-Carlo, Yacht Club de Monaco, and the F1 Paddock Club. Dark mode gives users an evening view of Monaco in a moonlit glow that activates at dusk.</p>
<p>  The Detailed City Experience also features amazing details for road markings, land cover, trees, and public transit routes, as well as helpful navigation details like turn lanes, medians, bus and bike lanes, and pedestrian crossings. It also features a windshield view for drivers, which shows a road-level view as a user approaches complex interchanges, making it easier to see upcoming traffic conditions or the best lane for an approaching exit.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p10">Apple has also added a lot of race-specific details, highlighting the course, landmark turns, as well as 3D representations of stands, cars, and more. Famous F1 courses have been added as <a href="https://maps.apple.com/guides?curated=147962789078570767&amp;_provider=9902" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Maps Guide</a> to promote Apple&rsquo;s upcoming F1 movie starring Brad Pitt, too.</p>
<p id="p11">I appreciate the growing catalog of original curated content accessible through Maps. Travel planning on the web is a messy process, but with guides and well-regarded editorial content embedded directly in Maps, it&rsquo;s often much easier to find a restaurant, hotel, or activity that sifting through an endless list of Google Search links.</p>
