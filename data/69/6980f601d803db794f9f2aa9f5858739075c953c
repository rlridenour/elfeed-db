<p id="p2">The promise of portable dual monitors has always been compelling, but the execution has consistently fallen short, until now. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4QLMNCP?ref=t_ac_view_request_product_image&amp;campaignId=amzn1.campaign.1LIK1AGVYEWM2&amp;linkCode=tr1&amp;tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkId=amzn1.campaign.1LIK1AGVYEWM2_1754302731871" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSAUX&rsquo;s FlipGo 16&rdquo; Dual Touchscreen Monitor</a> breaks new productivity ground for Mac users. Unlike some alternatives, the FlipGo Pro leverages both DisplayLink technology and native connectivity to deliver true dual-screen functionality on Apple silicon Macs with a single USB-C cable.</p>
<p id="p3">At its core, the FlipGo represents thoughtful engineering applied to everyday workflows. Its two 16-inch IPS panels deliver genuine 2.5K resolution (2560&times;1600 total resolution), 100% sRGB color accuracy, and 500 nits brightness. The key innovation lies in the FlipGo&rsquo;s versatility: switch between UltraView mode for a single expansive workspace, DuoViews for independent dual screens, or ABC mode to create a true triple-monitor setup when combined with your MacBook&rsquo;s display. You can learn more about the benefits of a foldable dual-screen setup in John&rsquo;s review of the similar non-touch version of the FlipGo Pro <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/getting-away-from-your-desk-with-jsauxs-flipgo-pro-dual-display/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p id="p4">Build quality of the FlipGo Pro is superb and is a big part of why it won an iF Design Award and Red Dot award in 2024. The aluminum construction feels substantial without being cumbersome at 1.6kg, while the magnetic mounting system secures everything when the screens are attached to their stand. Even the hinge mechanism is made from premium materials, making it perfect for professionals to take on the go daily.</p>
<p id="p5">For those who value integrated workflows, the FlipGo&rsquo;s built-in USB hub functionality provides two USB-A 2.0 ports and an additional USB-C port, effectively expanding your MacBook&rsquo;s connectivity while powering the displays. When connected to external power, it even provides reverse charging to your laptop &mdash; a thoughtful touch that eliminates battery drain during extended sessions.</p>
