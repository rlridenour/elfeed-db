<blockquote>
  <p>Paramount will settle President Trump’s lawsuit over a “60
Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris for $16 million, the company
announced late Tuesday.</p>

<p>CBS News’ parent company worked with a mediator to resolve the
lawsuit. Under the agreement, $16 million will be allocated to Mr.
Trump’s future presidential library and the plaintiffs’ fees and
costs. Neither Mr. Trump nor his co-plantiff, Texas Rep. Ronny
Jackson, will be directly paid as part of the settlement.</p>

<p>The settlement did not include an apology.</p>
