<blockquote>
  <p>For years, London’s police assumed most of the phone thefts were
the work of small-time thieves looking to make some quick cash.
But last December, they got an intriguing lead from a woman who
had used “Find My iPhone” to track her device to a warehouse near
Heathrow Airport. Arriving there on Christmas Eve, officers found
boxes bound for Hong Kong. They were labeled as batteries but
contained almost 1,000 stolen iPhones. [...]</p>

<p>The police are now using that information to map where stolen
phones are transported by street thieves. After the Heathrow
seizure, a team of specialist investigators who normally deal with
firearms and drug smuggling was assigned to the case. They
identified further shipments and used forensics to identify two
men in their 30s who are suspected of being ringleaders of a group
that sent up to 40,000 stolen phones to China.</p>

<p>When the men were arrested on Sept. 23, the car they were
traveling in contained several phones, some wrapped in aluminum
foil in an attempt to prevent them from transmitting tracking
signals. At one point, the police said at a news conference, they
observed the men buying almost 1.5 miles’ worth of foil in Costco.</p>

<p>There’s shopping in bulk at Costco, and then there’s shopping in bulk.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I forgot to apply one of the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/09/philly-plastic-bags-ban">core tenets</a> of Brian Kernighan’s wonderful book <em><a href="https://kernighan.org/mbz.html">Millions, Billions, Zillions</a></em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Millions-Billions-Zillions-Defending-Yourself/dp/0691182779/?tag=df-amzn-20">$19 in hardcover from Amazon</a>; <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/millions-billions-zillions-defending-yourself-in-a-world-of-too-many-numbers/9780691209098">BookShop.org link to indie booksellers</a>): always do some back-of-the-envelope double-checking of the math in news stories. 1.5 miles of aluminum (or even aluminium) foil from Costco is just 12 rolls at <a href="https://www.costco.co.uk/Grocery-Household/Grocery-Delivery/Kirkland-Signature-Premium-Quality-Foodservice-Aluminium-Foil-30cm-x-200m/p/97405">200 meters each</a>. I wouldn’t blink my eyes at someone with a dozen rolls of foil in the cart at Costco.</p>
