Apple this week secured another victory in its ongoing legal dispute with heart monitoring company AliveCor, after a federal appeals court upheld a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-wins-alivecor-antitrust-fight/">2024 ruling</a> that found Apple's changes to the Apple Watch were lawful product improvements rather than anticompetitive behavior.<br/>

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court decision that rejected AliveCor's antitrust claims. AliveCor had argued that Apple illegally monopolized the market for heart rate analysis apps on watchOS when it replaced its Heart Rate during Physical Observation (HRPO) algorithm with its heart rate neural network (HRNN) algorithm in watchOS 5. <br/>
<br/>
AliveCor claimed that Apple changed the algorithm so that its ECG KardiaBand could no longer identify irregular heart rhythms – as part of an alleged effort to "eliminate opposition" in the heart rate analysis space – and requested that it reinstate the old algorithm.<br/>
<br/>
Apple argued that AliveCor did not have the right to dictate Apple's design decisions, and that the request to support the older heart rate technology would require the court to be a day-to-day enforcer of how Apple engineers its products. The court ultimately agreed with Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The Ninth Circuit has now affirmed Apple's victory. "The undisputed evidence shows as a matter of law that Apple's refusal to share HRPO data was not anticompetitive," <a href="https://content.mlex.com/Attachments/2024-02-13_96R1Q69F5VP38H27/Alivecor%20v%20Apple%20order.pdf">the court wrote</a>. It added that even if some form of heart rate data access were essential for competing in the market, AliveCor's claim would still fail because Apple provides app developers with access to the same Tachogram API data that Apple's Irregular Rhythm Notification feature uses.<br/>
<br/>
The appeals court also rejected AliveCor's argument that Apple had a duty to share its proprietary data with competitors. The ruling said that antitrust laws generally impose no obligation for companies to deal with their rivals. It also noted that such a requirement "would implicate the same concerns regarding incentives to innovate and judicial competency that the Supreme Court has articulated."<br/>
<br/>
The decision is Apple's second major win against AliveCor within the last year. In March, the Federal Circuit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-alivecor-itc-win/">confirmed</a> the invalidation of three AliveCor patents related to heart rate monitoring, vacating an International Trade Commission ruling that could have led to an Apple Watch import ban.<br/>
<br/>
AliveCor said at the time of the court's original ruling that it was "deeply disappointed" by the decision and would continue to explore all available legal options, including potential appeals.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alivecor/">AliveCor</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/09/apple-wins-another-victory-alivecor-legal-battle/">Apple Wins Another Round in AliveCor Legal Battle Over Heart Rate Tech</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wins-another-round-in-alivecor-legal-battle-over-heart-rate-tech.2475815/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
