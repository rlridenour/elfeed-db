<blockquote><p>
The audience at &#8230; a play are spectators of a world they are not in. They see what they may well describe as, say, Othello in front of a certain palace in Venice &#8230; [b]ut they are not themselves at any specifiable distance from that palace. &#8230; </p>
<p>I see Othello strangle Desdemona; but that will not entail that I, as part of my biography, have ever seen anyone strangle anyone. Nor need the actress who plays Emilia ever see a dead body; but Emilia does, for she sees the dead body of Desdemona.

<p>&#8220;[W]e can in fact even visualise the unseen, because the fact that in visualisation I am as it were seeing is not itself necessarily an element of what is visualised.&#8221;</p>
