<p>A suicide bomber struck a Shi’ite mosque in Islamabad during Friday prayers, killing at least 31 people and injuring about 169 others, according to officials and multiple news reports. The Islamic State group said it carried out the attack, which several outlets called the deadliest such strike in Pakistan’s capital since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing. After the blast, authorities rushed the wounded to hospitals, and funerals for some victims were held on Saturday. The bombing has also sharpened questions about security in and around Islamabad, amid broader militant violence that some reporting says is rising beyond Pakistan’s border areas. Separately, India rejected what it called “baseless” accusations of any link to the bombing, a reminder of how quickly attacks like this can spill into already tense regional politics.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/O--eGnY7EvfkRgAxpCGqQlyOIVl7XlCTywgSW2Dsy4HLNHpYOh4isW8-v72fi8VrDpr_o9oFlmptrexUbqu4koKarF0VOz0gGy753fDErJq4pfIdsuF0nx-zdn_IG2EdJI_JUj1jaHijZRIM1Bnddft9N1ApvnKsFBqq4fLjw8azdKMZVt5b_oMysDJ7gzvopU0W4Xj69ZJ19BR9cdgxeeONDGR_H-BBM4C5bEDIzqh6kAprnyB7J7gA' alt='A man reacts after a deadly explosion at a Shi&#x27;ite Muslim mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan, February 6, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Blast and setting: Witnesses and city officials said an “extremely powerful” explosion tore through the Imam Bargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra mosque on Islamabad’s outskirts as worshippers gathered for Friday prayers.</li><li>Emergency response: Some reports said hospitals declared an emergency while ambulances rushed the wounded in for treatment after the blast.</li><li>Militant context: Reuters factboxes cited by multiple outlets note that Islamic State emerged from the conflicts in Iraq and Syria and later expanded through affiliates; Pakistan, meanwhile, has faced multiple insurgencies in its border provinces.</li><li>Regional tension: India’s denial of any link to the attack added a diplomatic layer to the immediate security response after the bombing.</li><li>Islamabad trend: The New York Times reported that this was the second major attack in recent months in Islamabad, adding to fears that extremist violence is spreading beyond border regions.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Islamic State: The group claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing, according to multiple reports citing its statement.
