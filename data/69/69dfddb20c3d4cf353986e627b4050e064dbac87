Good news for Emacsers.  Sean Whitton <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2025-12/msg00788.html">has been appointed an Emacs maintainer by RMS</a>. He joins a list of really excellent maintainers who devote untold hours of their time maintaining Emacs for our benefit. It&rsquo;s hard to overstate the debt that we owe them.

<p>
Mostly, of course, they never hear from us except when there&rsquo;s a complaint. That&rsquo;s really unfortunate and we should all try to do better about thanking them for their selfless efforts.

<p>
I don&rsquo;t know anything about Whitton except that he&rsquo;s been active on the Emacs mailing list and has more than demonstrated his commitment to Emacs. Judging from his message on the mailing list, I feel certain that he&rsquo;s going to be a real asset.

Join me in welcoming Sean and be sure to buy him a beer if you happen to find yourself in a bar with him.</p>
