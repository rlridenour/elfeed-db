</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A #poem reflecting on land and language.
</p>
        <p class="verse">
My ancestors carried with them a lowland language,<br />
From flat Frisia to the banks of Motława,<br />
later amongst the golden fields of Ukraine,<br />
then, with treasured seed in tow, the prairie of Nebraska.<br />
<br />
Listening to my father, aunt, and uncle speak<br />
Their low German, I hear my poverty revealed.<br />
This past year, I recorded them one night;<br />
Visions of zweibach and veranika danced in my head.<br />
Their accents and cadences invoking<br />
the first of three spirits visiting that old miser,<br />
<br />
They were telling tales of yore,<br />
dredging as only the Dutch might,<br />
laughter from the depths of half an age ago.<br />
Mischief that spoke of simpler times<br />
(At least that’s what nostalgia would have me say).<br />
<br />
As paternal lineage goes,<br />
I’m first generation English-as-a-first-language.<br />
Raised on the prairie, fed a new language too,<br />
I see now, as second generation, a privation<br />
Of language and lore.  I learned the simple new words<br />
of these not-so-simple folk.<br />
<br />
Yet, old Scrooge and I, we’re much the same.<br />
With our impoverished lexicon, near bankrupt<br />
as we fail to name much more<br />
beyond accounts and ledgers.<br />
Were that I had the native tongue,<br />
I might know more than corn fields and cricks.<br />
<br />
These days I read poetry, hoping to learn the song<br />
I know still and once sung.  Reading Heaney, Shepherd,<br />
and many others, I feel again my poverty.<br />
<br />
I’m too new to this language<br />
(though it is my only one),<br />
the one not of my father,<br />
but of a land fed on red, black, and brown blood.<br />
A language (and land) that borrows, robs, and steals.<br />
<br />
An’ I wonder, to which (or whom) am I cognate?<br />
Me, a settler adrift on these amber waves.<br />
