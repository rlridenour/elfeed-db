Elon Musk has threatened legal action against Apple, claiming that the company is violating antitrust rules by favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT in App Store rankings over his Grok AI assistant.<br/>

"Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action," Musk said in a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1955073616996975095">post</a> on X (Twitter), which he also owns. <br/>
<br/>
Musk failed to provide evidence to support his claim. Meanwhile, fellow X users noted that DeepSeek reached #1 overall on the App Store in January, long after Apple's partnership with OpenAI was announced that allows Siri to offload complex queries to ChatGPT.<br/>
<br/>
The tech billionaire also <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1955046467993059530">criticized</a> Apple for not featuring X or Grok in the App Store's "Must Have" section. ChatGPT currently holds the top spot for free apps, while Grok ranks sixth. Google's Gemini chatbot sits at 57th.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman hit back with his own post on X, calling Musk's claims "<a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1955094792804720660">remarkable</a>" given allegations about Musk manipulating his own social media platform to benefit his companies.<br/>
<br/>
Musk's remarks come amid growing pressure on Apple from regulators and competitors over its App Store practices. In April, a U.S. judge ruled that Apple violated a court order to open the App Store to more competition and referred the company for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-vp-criminal-contempt-outright-lies-epic-case/">criminal contempt probe</a>, following a case brought by <em>Fortnite</em> maker Epic Games. <br/>
<br/>
The same month, the EU fined Apple €500 million (&#36;587 million) for violating the Digital Markets Act, citing restrictions that blocked developers from directing users to cheaper offers outside the App Store.
