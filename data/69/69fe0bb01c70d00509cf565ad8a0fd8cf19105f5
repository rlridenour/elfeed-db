Error Message File mode specification error: (error Error running ‘/home/me/epdfinfo’: /home/me/epdfinfo: error while loading shared libraries: libpoppler.so.108: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Fix My system recently upgraded libpoppler to 1.09 with no 1.08 in sight. By making a symlink so that 1.08 is actually pointing at 1.09, pdftools resumed operation. A risky maneauver since we can&rsquo;t guarantee 1.09 isn&rsquo;t breaking, but it seems to work here and could be easily undone if necessary.
