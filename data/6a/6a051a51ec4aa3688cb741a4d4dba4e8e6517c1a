  <p>But you’ve heard about all of that, I’m sure, so we’re not going
to rehash it. Instead, let’s get personal: I’m picking out, in
my opinion, the best and worst new features of each of Apple’s
platforms. To be clear, these are my <em>completely scientific</em> and
<em>totally well-reasoned</em> expert opinions on the features that
were announced, not just some off-the-cuff reactions less than a
day later.</p>
