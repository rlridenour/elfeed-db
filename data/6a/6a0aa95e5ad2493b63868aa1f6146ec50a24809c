<p>July was a busy month in the MacSparky Labs, with members diving deep into productivity workflows and Apple&#8217;s latest features. We spent considerable time exploring Apple Reminders, including a dedicated deep dive session and hands-on videos covering the new quick capture features in iOS 26.</p>



<p>The monthly book club continued with our exploration of &#8220;Tiny Experiments,&#8221; while our regular Jam Sessions tackled career discussions—a topic that clearly resonated with the community. Members also got early access to beta experiences and explored creative uses for familiar apps like Voice Memos for transcription and Apple&#8217;s Journal app on iPadOS.</p>



<p>Beyond the Apple ecosystem, we experimented with AI tools like ChatGPT and Image Playground, tested alternative browsers like Dia, and even discussed unconventional productivity approaches like using glass boards for accountability.</p>



<p>The regular Lab Reports, meetups, and quarterly planning sessions kept everyone connected and focused on what&#8217;s working in their personal productivity systems. It&#8217;s exactly the kind of collaborative exploration that makes the Labs community special—taking both new releases and established tools and finding better ways to make them work for real people.</p>
