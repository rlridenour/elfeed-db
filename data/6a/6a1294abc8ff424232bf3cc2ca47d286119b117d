         
         <p>I just created a Git repository for my new Emacs package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font</code>.
It is a major mode that renders the current TTF or OTF file in an
Emacs buffer. The text on display consists of a pangram and a block of
carefully selected characters that showcase the font’s qualities.
Those snippets of text are configurable, of course.</p>

<p>Here is the idea of what you get when you visit a TTF or OTF file in
Emacs (click to enlarge for optimal results and notice that each
typeface is different):</p>

<p><a href="https://protesilaos.com/assets/images/attachments/2024-08-24-emacs-show-font.png"><img alt="show-font.el with three different fonts" src="https://protesilaos.com/assets/images/attachments/2024-08-24-emacs-show-font.png" /></a></p>

<p>What I now have is an early prototype. There still are some issues I
need to figure out for a complete end-user experience.</p>

<p>Previews now work only with locally installed fonts. Eventually, I
want to provide an option to install the current font, else to notify
the user that the rendered preview is inaccurate.</p>

<p>At any rate, my plan is to push <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-font</code> to GNU ELPA in the coming
days. If you do give it a try, please let me know how it goes.</p>

<h2>About show-font</h2>

<p>WORK-IN-PROGRESS.</p>

<p>This package defines a major mode to preview a font in an Emacs
buffer. A pangram and character set are displayed at varying heights
to help the user appreciate the given font’s features.</p>

<p>For the time being, this only works with fonts that are already
installed on the system.</p>
