The latest addition to the <a href="https://macadie.info/2025/07/21/emacs-carnival-writing-experience/">Emacs Carnival on Writing Experience</a> is from <a href="https://macadie.info/2025/07/21/emacs-carnival-writing-experience/">Eric MacAdie</a>. He begins by saying that with the exception of source code, he hardly ever writes plain text files anymore, only Org files. I realized, when I read that, that it also applies to me. Even when I&rsquo;m just taking a quick note, it starts out as an Org file and may later be fleshed out to be a full fledged Org file but even if it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s an org file with all the formatting and structure that implies.

MacAdie does the same thing although he sometimes starts with a paper note. We here in the Irreal Bunker long ago gave up the use of such primitive tools but the idea is the same: capture an embryonic idea and flesh it out as your understanding ripens.

MacAdie also uses Org to publish his blog posts about the <a href="https://macadie.info/category/emacs/emacs-meetup/">EmacsATX meetings</a> but his workflow is considerably different from mine. It&rsquo;s another demonstration of how Emacs and Org mode can adjust themselves to suit your individual requirements.

Take a look at his post to see one way to leverage Emacs and Org for your writing. It probably won&rsquo;t match your needs exactly but you might get some ideas.</p>
