For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://collectiblephones.com/">Collectible Phones</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. Collectible Phones is an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> art company created by industry insider Sonny Dickson.<br/>

With Collectible Phones, Dickson purchases out-of-commission iPhones from recycling facilities, saving them from being sent to a landfill and creating waste. Collectible Phones chooses the best of the recycled iPhones to disassemble and preserve for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; collectors. The nicest components are selected, carefully adhered to a backboard, and protected with a high-quality frame.<br/>
<br/>
Each component is labeled with details, specifications, and historical information, so you'll see data about the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display, logic board, battery, and more. Launch date, pricing, and other interesting tidbits are included as well.<br/>

Collectible Phones' key offering <a href="https://collectiblephones.com/products/collectible-2g?variant=43825151934644">is the &#36;298 Collectible 2G</a>, which features Apple's original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from 2007. Each component of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 2G includes a description and the parts are logically laid out so you can see each little detail from Apple's first-ever &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Dickson even sourced an original screenshot of the first version of iOS, and the piece includes a high-quality look at the initial version of iOS.<br/>

Each Collectible 2G piece can be purchased with either a black frame or a silver frame, and they're ready to hang on the wall. Frames measure in at 30cm x 42.3cm, and the site offers free worldwide shipping. If you're interested in purchasing a Collectible 2G, you can use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to see how it will look in your space before buying.<br/>
