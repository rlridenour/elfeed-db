MacRumors is pleased to announce our <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2456273/">Sixteenth Annual MacRumors Blood Drive</a>, throughout the month of May 2025. Let's save lives together by encouraging donations of blood, platelets, and plasma, and signing up as bone marrow and organ donors. While most blood drives are specific to a geographic location, our blood drive is online and worldwide. Anyone can participate.<br/>

Over the past 15 years, MacRumors Blood Drives have recorded donations of <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/posts/33175443/">1,565 units of blood, platelets, and plasma</a>, cheered for donors, and celebrated new signups for the bone marrow and organ donor registries. We've heard from hundreds of forum members who donate or whose lives were saved by the donations of strangers.<br/>
<br/>
This year's featured donor is user Linda+, who donates platelets every 2 or 3 weeks. Whether you're a regular donor like Linda+ or someone overcoming apprehension to donate for the very first time, we congratulate you.<br/>
