Despite years of rumors suggesting Apple is working on Macs with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> instead of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, the technology isn't coming any time soon, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/apple-readies-high-end-macbook-pro-with-touch-hole-punch-screen"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

Gurman claims that Apple is aiming to shift from &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; to &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; in the Mac line, but the change "remains years away."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/24/macos-big-sur-touch-id-coming-to-macs/">and others</a> have incorrectly predicted &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; for Macs several times over the past five years. In 2021, Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-07-25/covid-news-apple-store-and-office-reopening-delayed-krjib3qr">said he'd bet Face ID</a> would come to the Mac "within a couple of years." In the same year, he said Apple planned to add &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/22/face-id-imac-second-version-of-redesign/">to the M1 iMac</a>, but did not end up doing so. In 2022, he said Apple had "definitely" been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/07/face-id-macbook-display-tech-doesnt-exist/">working on Face ID</a> for Macs, but "time will tell if they launch it."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman did not provide any new information about &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; for the Mac today than he did in 2021 when he first mentioned it, so the feature may remain "years away" for the next decade.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021, Apple marketing VP Tom Boger said that there's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/29/apple-face-id-touchscreens-macs/">no Face ID on the Mac</a> because &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; is more convenient. Users' hands are already on the keyboard, so Apple feels that &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; makes more sense. It's possible Apple's thinking on the matter will shift when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/macbook-pro-oled-touch-screen/">touch screen Macs come out</a> in late 2026 or 2027.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/face-id/">Face ID</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/mac-face-id-years-away/">Face ID for Mac Remains Distant Despite Years of Rumors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/face-id-for-mac-remains-distant-despite-years-of-rumors.2469259/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
