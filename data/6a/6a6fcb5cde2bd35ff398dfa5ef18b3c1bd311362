Chris Maiorana has <a href="https://chrismaiorana.com/the-undergrad-note-style/">an interesting post on note taking with Emacs</a>. He says that Emacs and, in particular Org mode, have all sorts of functions to make taking notes easier but that it&rsquo;s easy to get bogged down in trying to decide what packages to use and how to organize your notes.
</p>

Maiorana&rsquo;s suggestion is to just take notes and not worry about any details in the beginning. After you have a hundred or so notes you can worry about the best way to organize them and you&rsquo;ll have a better idea of what packages you should use to take and organize them.

<p>
He has another suggestion for the type of note to take. It&rsquo;s something he calls &ldquo;The Undergrad Note&rdquo;. The idea is that each note has
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A claim</li>
<li>A quote illustrating the claim</li>
<li>Your explanation or justification for the claim</li>
</ol>
<p>
He gives an example from Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s <i>Notes From Underground</i>.  It illustrates nicely how the method works: You make a suggestion or supposition about something, supply a quote or other evidence about the quote/claim, and, finally, offer a justification for your claim.

His post is a reminder that you can&rsquo;t do it all with tools. Sometimes you need a method too. The Undergrad Note method probably won&rsquo;t be a perfect fit for your needs but as Maiorana says, that doesn&rsquo;t matter. The point is to get use to taking notes and discover the best method <i>for you</i> to do that.</p>
