<p>I recently bought a server on Ebay and wanted to install Linux on it, but
didn&rsquo;t have a monitor! I discovered that today there are tiny cheap devices
that you can plug into the HDMI/USB ports that let me:</p>
<ul>
<li>go to <a href="http://192.168.1.xxx">http://192.168.1.xxx</a> to see the monitor output (and interact with it as if I had a keyboard plugged into the server)</li>
<li>store a bunch of ISOs on the device and pick which one I want to mount as a
USB drive</li>
</ul>
<p>I got this <a href="https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM?tab=readme-ov-file#where-to-buy">NanoKVM</a>
device on Aliexpress for $80 and it seems to do what it advertises!</p>
<p>The CPU is quite slow so <code>scp</code>ing ISOs to it seems limited by the CPU speed, I
can only scp at 5MB/s.</p>
