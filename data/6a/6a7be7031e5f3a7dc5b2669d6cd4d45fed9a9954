For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://shop.astropad.com">Astropad</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, and one of <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/collections/shop-astropad/products/rock-paper-pencil">Astropad's Rock Paper Pencil kits</a> to go along with it.<br/>

Rock Paper Pencil is a product that's meant to make writing on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; feel like writing on a piece of paper rather than on a slippery display. Astropad <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/astropad-rock-paper-pencil-3/">just overhauled</a> Rock Paper Pencil to make it better than ever, so now is a good time to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/collections/shop-astropad/products/rock-paper-pencil">&#36;45 kit</a> includes a NanoCling screen protector that goes on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s display, and an accompanying &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; tip that pairs with an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. You can put the NanoCling screen protector on while you're using your &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, then take it off and tuck it away for later if you want to use your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; without it. It takes just seconds to put the screen protector on and remove it again, and it doesn't leave a sticky residue on your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>

The upgraded NanoCling screen protector has an improved feel, plus it's thinner. Writing on it is like writing on a stack of papers rather than just a single sheet, and it's a little softer and smoother than before. Using the NanoCling is a pleasant experience that makes note taking and sketching on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; feel more natural. Even though it has a unique microscopic texture that mimics the feel of paper, the screen protector doesn't interfere with the vivid colors of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s display.<br/>

Astropad also redesigned the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; tip that comes in the Rock Paper Pencil kit, and it's now made from solid stainless steel that won't wear down or chip over time. The size of the tip has also been increased, so it's now 1mm instead of 0.75mm. The larger tip balances out the friction and improves durability.<br/>
<br/>
If you dislike the slippery feeling of writing on a hard screen, the Rock Paper Pencil is worth checking out. It does a great job of making you forget that you're writing on a tablet because it both feels and sounds like using a pen on paper.<br/>
