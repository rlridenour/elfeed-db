<p>&#8220;I should have presented my topic using the p4c [philosophy for children] method,&#8221; said a philosopher about about his talk at a conference on Plato&#8217;s theory of forms, after taking part in a demonstration of it.<span id="more-55816"></span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">What Can Professional Philosophers Learn from Philosophy for Children?<br />
<em><strong>by Sophia Stone</strong></em></h2>
<p>On October 17, 2025, something remarkable happened in the world of Platonic scholarship. After giving my talk on Socratic conversations with children at the <a href="https://www.platonskaspolecnost.cz/en/platos-theory-of-forms-programme-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XVth Symposium Platonicum Pragense</a>, seven serious Plato scholars joined me for a “philosophy for children, Hawai’ian style”  discussion (aka p4cHI). The big “P” philosophers&#8212;serious scholars with impressive publication records&#8212;participated in what p4cHI calls “little p philosophy”.</p>
<p>We all know what big P philosophy is&#8212;that’s what we <em>do</em>, it is what we get paid to teach. It is how we earn our livelihood. It is what <em>Daily Nous</em> is all about&#8212;the profession of big P philosophy. Little p philosophy is what all children do&#8212;they ask questions for the sake of asking questions. They wonder, and they don’t have a destination for their wondering. In fact, it can be quite irritating or interesting, depending on your tastes for engaging in unstructured, on the spot, spontaneous questioning with children. Many professional scholars, including big P philosophers, think that serious philosophizing cannot be done with children, nor, for that matter, any methods that children might use to engage in wonder, many of which are a form of play.</p>
<p>But Plato in the <em>Republic </em>VII writes that nothing taught compulsory stays in the soul, and that is why learning must be a kind of play. so what about serious, big P philosophy? Is it possible for serious big P philosophers to gain philosophical insight from little p philosophy?</p>
<p>The topic of the conference was Plato’s theory of forms. We had heard seven presentations from international big P philosophers, which we used as the ‘stimulus’ for our inquiry. It was the second day, so we felt comfortable with each other. We followed the gently Socratic method, otherwise known as ‘plain vanilla’. After reviewing the the <a href="https://www.cseashawaii.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P4C-Inquiry.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good Thinker’s Toolkit</a>, each participant was invited to write a question for discussion, a question that they still had after hearing the talks. Here are their questions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Why does Plato always refer to just a few forms, but almost all of the speakers talk as if everything has a form? </em><br />
<em>Do we need a proof for the existence of forms? </em><br />
<em>Are there some new forms, that did not exist in antiquity but now they do? </em><br />
<em>Does Plato really derive the existence of forms from epistemological arguments only? </em><br />
<em>Are forms mental artifacts, or real objects outside the mind? </em><br />
<em>Do we believe in forms? </em><br />
<em>Where are the invisible forms?</em></p>
<p>Before you continue reading, which question would you have chosen for discussion? Can you guess which one the group voted for?</p>
<p>Everyone was given two game tokens to place their markers on which question they wanted. At first it was a three-way tie, and then after voting again with the three winning questions, the group settled on the question of whether there are some new forms that exist now that didn’t exist in antiquity. At first, the group was nearly split in half on the question. Yet by the end, some scholars had shifted their views as more arguments were made and more perspectives were shared. The conversation lasted only ten-minutes; the whole process from circling, question airing, voting, discussion and public evaluation took about twenty minutes. The feedback was amazing.</p>
<p>Research fellow Prof. RNDr. Ladislav Kvasz, DSc. from the Czech Academy of Sciences remarked that the group quickly made deep philosophical progress with no negative feelings. Gregory MacIsaac, currently a Visiting Fellow at Cambridge, and Associate Professor at Carleton University, wrote the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I thought the exercise was very valuable. It was a bit humbling to see one’s question ‘not’ picked as the thing to discuss. But that is good. If the question isn’t yours, it forces you to listen to others. Also, I thought that using the ‘ball’ to choose who can speak was really effective. It was a gentle way of preventing people from interrupting others or dominating the discussion. It also helped that we trusted each other by the second day of the conference, because the same people were attending every session. So we were more inclined to listen to each other and to say what we really thought.</em></p>
<p>Filip Karfik, Professor emeritus from University of Fribourg called the p4cHI presentation “the pinnacle of the entire event,” and said, “I should have presented my topic using the p4c method.”</p>
<p>While big P philosophers typically think of Socrates and the elenchus as emblematic of a good philosopher doing good philosophy by berating his interlocutors with questions upon questions, little attention is paid to the fact that he was a <em>public philosopher</em>&#8212;always engaging in wonder with others in public settings. Socrates was so committed to his search for finding wisdom, that, if we were to believe the ancient reports, he often stood adjacent to the market square at Simon’s cobbler shop so he could engage in conversations with the youth who were too young to venture out into the marketplace, which had a minimum age restriction of 18.<em> </em></p>
<p>If we are to believe Socrates in Plato’s <em>Apology, </em>the moral compass Socrates used, his ‘daimonia’ or inner voice, developed when he was quite young. This is why p4c&#8212;philosophy for children&#8212;is an international movement, because communities world-wide see the value in conducting philosophical conversations with children. Communities and caregivers realize that children start developing their moral compass at an early age and from the moment they can speak, children start to wonder why. We do a disservice to our youth by thinking that children cannot engage in philosophical questioning. We do a disservice to ourselves by doing only big P philosophy in the stiff, isolated walls of the confined private classroom or the well-scheduled conference hall. When big P philosophers are open to new ways of doing philosophy, even if those new ways are designed for children, it can have a remarkable effect on how one approaches and thinks about philosophical problems.</p>
