<p>I got the new KVM, set it up, and I&rsquo;m not happy.</p>
<p>The new KVM switch doesn&rsquo;t work with my gaming keyboard (a split keyboard I use for its ergonomics mostly) connected to the dedicated USB on the KVM switch. There are issues with the mouse where it starts freezing randomly, and I need to replug the dungle. The keyboard shortcut key to switch between inputs doesn&rsquo;t work either.</p>
<p>I recall gaming keyboards work a bit differently than regular keyboards, and KVMs usually have issues with them, but my old one worked OK. So far, I&rsquo;ve had a better experience with the Software-based KVM. The keyboard worked fine, and I just had to plug in the mouse dangle for some games. The addition of a common clipboard is nice, and it doesn&rsquo;t cost me anything.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m looking at USB switches and asking around on Reddit. This seems to be a better solution. It won&rsquo;t allow me to switch video input, but I can do that physically on the screen and switch from one input to the other while both computers are connected.</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;ll see how it goes, but I think I&rsquo;m returning it.</p>
