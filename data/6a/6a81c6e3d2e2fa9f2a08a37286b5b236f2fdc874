<p>President Trump has authorized Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 artificial intelligence chips to China, softening earlier US export restrictions that had barred the company’s most powerful products from the Chinese market over security concerns. The Commerce Department is finalizing a framework that will also let AMD and Intel apply to export comparable accelerators, with the White House emphasizing a goal of AI leadership while collecting a 25% fee on such sales. China, which has been racing to build its own semiconductor ecosystem, is expected to permit but strictly limit imports of the H200, routing purchases through an approval system as Beijing continues to push state buyers toward domestic chips made by firms such as Huawei and Cambricon. Supporters of the US shift see an opportunity to stabilize global tech supply chains and keep American companies engaged in a huge market, while critics in Washington warn that the deal could bolster China’s military use of AI and erode years of security safeguards.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RHj063psS9bntu0zOjMm5iYjcWUDL5M8omr-luKGqZ2PSAohdhvGulLcBnVP_nyk6KDDdG3pmxbP3li7Bf65jB8TcvlUo8bcX-Q3Pbyz5dJGbmtIyvwS9WiSl8H-kpFInKUgF8xSei0jUg' alt='A worker holds a semiconductor wafer at a facility producing high-end computer chips, highlighting the global race for AI hardware.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>China procurement push: China’s finance ministry for the first time added locally designed AI accelerators from Huawei and Cambricon to its central government procurement catalog, signaling that agencies should prioritize homegrown chips in official purchases.</li><li>Beijing’s import controls: Chinese authorities are expected to require government review for H200 orders, meaning buyers may need to justify imports case-by-case rather than purchasing freely on the open market.</li><li>Security hawks’ warning: US China hawks and some Democratic lawmakers argue that giving Chinese firms access to high-end US accelerators risks enhancing Beijing’s military planning, surveillance and weapons development capabilities.</li><li>Strategic autonomy goal: Analysts note that Beijing sees foreign chips as a stopgap and is pursuing what one expert calls a path toward full strategic autonomy in semiconductors over time.</li><li>Leverage over rare earths: Trump’s policy shift comes as Washington also weighs China’s use of export controls on rare earth minerals, which are critical inputs for many high-tech and defense applications in the US and beyond.</li></ul><blockquote>China hopes that the US will take concrete actions to maintain the stability and smooth functioning of global supply chains. - Liu Pengyu</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: White House spokesperson Kush Desai said the administration seeks American dominance in AI while insisting that export decisions would not compromise national security, framing the move as a way to support US industry and maintain leverage.
