The store will be in a historic building originally built for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, at the corner of Forrest Place and Murray Street. Apple is taking over a space that was previously occupied by Australian swimwear retailer City Beach.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already has a store in central Perth on nearby Hay Street. That location, opened in 2010, will be permanently closing on Wednesday, June 25, and the newer and larger Forrest Place store will be holding its grand opening on Friday, June 27 at 9 a.m. local time.<br/>
<br/>
"Prepare to discover a flourishing hub of creativity, as we open the door to a new era of growth for Perth and for you," says Apple, on the store's page.<br/>
<br/>
To celebrate the upcoming store opening, Apple has shared a special floral-themed wallpaper. It is available to download <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/perthcity/">on the store page</a> for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.<br/>
