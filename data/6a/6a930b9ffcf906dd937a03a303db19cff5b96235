<p>Wonderfully detailed write-up of a perfect prop from Make3:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Repurposed Nagra Knobs &amp; Switches — To ground the device in a
tangible, vintage aesthetic, we salvaged original knobs and
switches from a 1990s Nagra IV-D recorder, seamlessly integrating
them into our design. These components not only provided an
authentic look and feel but also remained fully functional, with:</p>

<ul>
<li>A power switch for system activation.</li>
<li>A reading on/off switch to engage or disable the Woe display.</li>
<li>A manual override switch to cycle through needle positions if
wireless control failed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>When I watched this episode, I remember noticing how cool the device seemed. It turns out to be even cooler than I thought. So much effort into such a little thing. And the coolest thing is that, in a sense, the WoeMeter actually <em>works</em> as a handheld wireless prop.</p>

<p>Reusing those Nagra dials to add verisimilitude reminds me of how much of <em>Star Wars</em> came from reused pieces of old gadgetry, like two of the lightsabers (Luke’s and Vader’s) <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-42369174">being made from 1940s-era Graflex camera flash guns</a>.</p>
