<p>In 2012 I <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2012/12/12/no-answer/">mentioned</a> that Helen Fouché Gaines&#8217; 1956 textbook <em>Cryptanalysis: A Study of Ciphers and Their Solution</em> ends with <a href="https://archive.org/details/cryptanalysis00hele/page/216/mode/2up">a cipher that&#8217;s never been solved</a>. Reader Michel Esteban writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I think I found what kind of cipher Helen Fouché Gaines&#8217; last challenge is.<br />
In my opinion, it is a seriated Playfair of period 5 with two peculiarities:<br />
&#8211; Zs are nulls in the ciphertext,<br />
&#8211; Z is the omitted letter in the cipher square (instead of J).<br />
If I am right, period 5 is the most likely reasonable period: we can observe no coincidences between upper and lower letters.<br />
On the other hand, six reciprocal digrams appear: FD-DF, EC-CE, JN-NJ, JB-BJ, QL-LQ and GW-WG. These are almost certainly cipher counterparts of common reciprocal digrams (ES-SE, EN-NE, IT-TI, etc.).<br />
I did not solve this cipher, because it is too short to use statistics. The only way to solve it is to use some metaheuristics (like Hill Climbing), but I have no computer!<br />
I have no doubt you know someone that will be able to unveil the plaintext after having read these considerations.

<p>Can someone help? I&#8217;ll add any updates here.</p>
