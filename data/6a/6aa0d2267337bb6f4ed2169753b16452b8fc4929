<p id="p1">Jony Ive&rsquo;s stealth AI company known as io is being acquired by OpenAI for $6.5 billion in a deal that is expected to close this summer subject to regulatory approvals. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/openai-to-buy-apple-veteran-jony-ive-s-ai-device-startup-in-6-5-billion-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to reporting by Mark Gurman and Shirin Ghaffary of Bloomberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  The purchase &mdash; the largest in OpenAI&rsquo;s history &mdash; will provide the company with a dedicated unit for developing AI-powered devices. Acquiring the secretive startup, named io, also will secure the services of Ive and other former Apple designers who were behind iconic products such as the iPhone.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p3">The partnership builds on a 23% stake in io that OpenAI purchased at the end of last year and comes with what Bloomberg describes as 55 hardware engineers, software developers, and manufacturing experts, plus a cast of accomplished designers.</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  &ldquo;People have an appetite for something new, which is a reflection on a sort of an unease with where we currently are,&rdquo; Ive said, referring to products available today. Ive and Altman&rsquo;s first devices are slated to debut in 2026.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">Bloomberg also notes that Ive and his team of designers will be taking over all design at OpenAI, including software design like ChatGPT.</p>
<p id="p7">For now, the products OpenAI is working on remain a mystery, but given the purchase price and io&rsquo;s willingness to take its first steps into the spotlight, I expect we&rsquo;ll be hearing more about this historic collaboration in the months to come.</p>
