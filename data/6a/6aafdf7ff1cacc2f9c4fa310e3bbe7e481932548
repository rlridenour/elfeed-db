<li>Cute bowls that nest</li>
<li>Medium bowl has measurement markings, and small bowl has a built-in egg separator</li>
<li>Oven-, Dishwasher-, Freezer-, and Microwave-Safe</li>
<li>Carla Hall is cool (but also, her name isn’t even on these)</li>
<li>Are they available in Georgia Red: We’d say it’s more of a Waldo red+white</li>
</ul><h1>Lines Within</h1><p>“Senator Torrence,” said Tom, standing next to the Michigan lawmaker’s office door. “A word?”</p>
<p>Senator Torrence looked this way and that way to be sure no press were around. “Make it quick,” she said. “The last thing I need is some upstart saying they saw me with the Tom Martin of the dishwasher pod lobby in the primaries next year.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ll make it very quick,” Tom said. “We need some legislation passed.”</p>
<p>“What for?” Senator Torrence said.</p>
<p>“Not <em>for</em> anything. <em>Against</em> something. This.” Tom took out his phone.</p>
<p>“What am I looking at here?” Senator Torrence said.</p>
<p>“Bowls,” Tom said. “A cute set of nesting bowls, to be more accurate.”</p>
<p>“You want me to legislate against bowls?” Senator Torrence shook her head in disbelief. “I’m the senator of Michigan, Tom. The corporate headquarters of Kellogg’s.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not the bowls I’m worried about.” Tom zoomed in. “What do you see there?”</p>
<p>“Some writing inside the bowls?”</p>
<p>“Measurements,” Tom said. “That’s what we need legislation against.” He zoomed back out and pointed to the price. “And look: this set is a mere thirteen dollars. Do you see how ruinous this could be for us?”</p>
<p>Senator Torrence continued to squint at the phone screen held out in front of her. “Because if people can just measure things in the bowl they’re mixing in…”</p>
<p>“They won’t sully as many measuring implements,” said Tom.</p>
<p>“Which means fewer dishes to wash,” said Senator Torrence.</p>
<p>“Which means we move fewer units,” said Tom. “Which means smaller campaign contributions.”</p>
<p>Senator Torrence sighed. “Okay, I’ll see what I can do. But explain something to me. What is this site? It’s so strange. There’s all this text, but it seems to be telling a little story that’s barely about the product.”</p>
<p>“Their copywriter has an MFA, unfortunately,” Tom explained.</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Senator Torrence. “And the name? M-E-H? That has to stand for something, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s internet slang,” said Tom. “It actually means, ‘so-so’ or ‘mediocre.’ They’re being cheeky.”</p>
<p>“A bit past my time, I guess,” Senator Torrence said.</p>
<p>“Oh, right, of course,” Tom said. He had forgotten: she was 98 years old.</p>
