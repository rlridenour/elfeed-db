Apple and Google today announced that Google Gemini will help power not only <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-next-generation-siri/">a more personalized version of Siri</a>, but a range of future Apple Intelligence features.<br/>

"Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology," the companies said, in a <a href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010746083170046376">statement</a>. "These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year."<br/>
<br/>
Apple is "excited about the innovative new experiences" that the partnership will unlock, but the statement did not provide any details about specific features.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if Gemini will help power any existing Apple Intelligence features, such as Writing Tools, Image Playground, and Notification Summaries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and on Apple's Private Cloud Compute servers, with Apple promising industry-leading privacy standards.<br/>
<br/>
The more personalized version of Siri is expected to be introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/">with iOS 26.4 in March or April</a>, following a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">lengthy delay</a>. The new capabilities will include better understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. For example, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.<br/>
