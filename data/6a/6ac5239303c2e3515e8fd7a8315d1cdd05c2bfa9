It looks like Apple's foldable iPhone will have some "crease-free" competition.<br/>

Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1945871948468404342">said</a> Samsung's next-generation Galaxy Z Fold 8 will use the same laser-drilled metal display plate as the foldable iPhone, with the component to be supplied by South Korean company Fine M-Tec.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">new Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> still has a visible crease in the middle of its inner screen. However, Kuo said that Apple's stricter crease-free requirement for the foldable iPhone has essentially raised the bar for foldable devices, so it sounds like next year's Galaxy Z Fold 8 will feature a "crease-free" screen as well.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, Kuo said the laser-drilled metal plate can disperse the stress generated by bending, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/foldable-iphone-crease-free-samsung-display/">allowing for a "crease-free" screen</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The foldable iPhone's inner screen will be supplied by Samsung, according to Kuo, but it is the Fine M-Tec plate that will enable the "crease-free" feat.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said Apple is aiming to start mass production of the foldable iPhone in the second half of 2026, so the device should finally launch next year. He expects the device to have a 7.8-inch inner display, a 5.5-inch outer display, two rear cameras, one front camera, and a Touch ID power button instead of Face ID.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/foldable-iphone-galaxy-z-fold-8-crease-free/">Foldable iPhone and Samsung&#039;s Galaxy Z Fold 8 Both Expected to Have &#039;Crease-Free&#039; Screen</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-and-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-8-both-expected-to-have-crease-free-screen.2461719/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
