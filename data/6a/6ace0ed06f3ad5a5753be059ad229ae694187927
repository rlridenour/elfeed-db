In the wake of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-anti-steering-injunction-violation/">yesterday's court ruling</a> in the dispute between Apple and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> over Apple's policies restricting developers' ability to inform users about alternatives to making purchases through Apple's in-app purchasing system, Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=9txfddzf">updated</a> its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Review Guidelines</a> to comply with the ruling.<br/>

Apple summarized the changes in an email to developers today:<blockquote>3.1.1: Apps on the United States storefront are not prohibited from including buttons, external links, or other calls to action when allowing users to browse NFT collections owned by others.<br/>
<br/>
3.1.1(a): On the United States storefront, there is no prohibition on an app including buttons, external links, or other calls to action, and no entitlement is required to do so.<br/>
<br/>
3.1.3: The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United States storefront.<br/>
<br/>
3.1.3(a): The External Link Account entitlement is not required for apps on the United States storefront to include buttons, external links, or other calls to action.</blockquote>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Apple must immediately comply with the ruling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-rule-change-appeal/">even as the company moves to appeal</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The changes are currently limited to the United States given the scope of the court case, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-apple-peace-proposal/">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney offered a "peace proposal"</a> pledging to drop all remaining litigation against Apple over the issue if Apple were to implement the required U.S. changes on a worldwide basis. Apple has so far given no indication that it is interested in accepting that proposal.<br/>
<br/>
Following the court ruling and with Apple's policy changes, major app developers are already moving to make it easier for users to purchase or subscribe to content outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/spotify-ios-update-web-purchase-link/">Spotify already submitting an app update</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/patreon-ios-app-update-in-app-purchases/">Patreon indicating that it will do so</a>, and &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; saying that it will bring Fortnite back to the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store-review-guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-updates-u-s-app-review-guidelines-epic/">Apple Updates U.S. App Review Guidelines Following Epic Games Ruling</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-updates-u-s-app-review-guidelines-following-epic-games-ruling.2456351/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
