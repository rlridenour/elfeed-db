<p>I’m going to let you in on a little secret: I mostly don’t link to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> because I assume that anyone who reads Six Colors reads Daring Fireball. And if you don’t, you probably should.</p>
<p>But in the wake of <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/12/in-a-major-coup-for-someone-alan-dye-leaves-apple/">Alan Dye’s departure</a> yesterday, I feel I need to explicitly link to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/12/bad_dye_job">John Gruber’s long, sourced, well-thought-out piece on the subject</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The sentiment within the ranks at Apple is that today’s news is almost too good to be true. People had given up hope that Dye would ever get squeezed out, and no one expected that he’d just up and leave on his own. (If you care about design, there’s nowhere to go but down after leaving Apple. What people overlooked is the obvious: Alan Dye doesn’t actually care about design.)
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s got brutal honesty, the true read on Dye from people inside Apple, and how in the end it’s an opportunity for change. I can’t help thinking that the possibility of change is the thing that’s really exciting a lot of people who closely follow Apple and its products.</p>
