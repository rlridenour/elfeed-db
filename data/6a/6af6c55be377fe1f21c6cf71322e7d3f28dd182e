<p><strong>Just Eating Peanut Butter Out of a Jar with a Spoon</strong></p>
<p><em>Pros</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No dust on your hands</li>
<li>Also might be organic</li>
<li>Smooth and chunky options</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cons</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You have to wash a spoon after each bite</li>
<li>Conversely, you can go in for spoonful after spoonful, but that means acknowledging that you’re alone in this world, without anyone to share your peanut butter with</li>
<li>As said above, it <em>might</em> be organic, but WTF is up with organic peanut butter? Why is it that the more expensive the jar, the worse that stuff tastes?</li>
<li>If you get the kind where the oil separates, it’s annoying to stir, and the first few spoonfuls will be almost all liquid whereas the bottom of the jar will be almost entirely dry</li>
<li>Not currently for sale on this site</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>In conclusion</strong></em></p>
<p>Both are great options, but we’re only selling the puffs today.</p>
