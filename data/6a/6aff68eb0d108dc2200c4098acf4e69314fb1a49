<p>Adobe Design profiles Adobe’s new Premiere app for iOS, and interviews Christopher Azar, group design manager for Adobe Video, regarding the thinking behind the app and its design:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What was the primary goal when you set out to design Premiere
on iOS?</em></p>

<p>Christopher Azar: Our goal was to design a professional-grade
product that carried the powerful, precise spirit of Premiere
while feeling modern, approachable, and even fun. We call our
vision “intuitive precision”: a high-performance, intelligent tool
powered by cutting-edge AI that enables creators to work how and
where they want — in the field, experimenting, and honing their
storytelling craft.</p>

<p>That meant making this editing power available to a broader
creative community. Desktop software has traditionally been built
for professionals with large budgets. Our goal was not only to
make a professional tool easier to use, but to make it available
to more people than ever before. I would have wanted to use this
app when I was coming up as a creative, so I’m excited we’re
providing high-quality software for everyone who wants it — without a big investment in time or money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really does seem like a breakthrough app for the platform. An Android version is in the works, Adobe says, but for now, Premiere is an iOS exclusive. Kind of weird that Apple itself makes Final Cut Pro for both the Mac and iPad, but still hasn’t made a serious video editing app for the iPhone.</p>
