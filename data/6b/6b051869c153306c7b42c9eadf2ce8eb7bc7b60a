Peacock is offering new subscribers a chance to get a full year of its premium plan for just <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/"><strong>&#36;24.99 for your first year</strong></a>, down from the regular price of &#36;79.99 per year. This is only a &#36;5 difference when compared to Peacock's Black Friday discount from last year, making it one of the service's best offers so far in 2025.<br/>

Peacock's premium annual plan is the ad-supported tier of the streaming service. This offer excludes current paying subscribers of Peacock, and after it ends the service will return to the regular &#36;79.99 per year price (or then-current price, if a price hike happens).<br/>
