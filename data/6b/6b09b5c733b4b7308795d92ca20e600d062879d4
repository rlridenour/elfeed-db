<p>The Netherlands held a snap parliamentary election on 29 October 2025 after anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders helped bring down the previous government over migration policy, forcing voters back to the polls . The vote is widely framed as a referendum on the rise of the far right in Europe, with campaign debates dominated by migration and an acute housing shortage . Pundits and pollsters say the race is much tighter than last time, and the result will determine which parties must try to form a coalition government in the weeks ahead .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/9LvrAKrzPFVzFqCG515EA5xMceaRkO3lx3yMguGZEkV0TenByygLeEhnv7eAQV8vFE_z4h2BSX1USkypPvV2n-wpP_-tkbYw3DcB9h9Zm2rwtrdC318C8KsEZCGDebjvd5XH4KgWRlxlMXcxKNxU8y9lLWAwiCOxrKSQ1hGG1ZrgY_tDlpKP7QAuatm1rY0z5ZGmDBWmZ2jzTdVPxiRp4egzone8Sjz15BXPsL9hRe5k1mSw7SE' alt='Geert Wilders, leader of the Party for Freedom, speaking last month in Denmark; he is known for his anti-Islam and anti-immigrant stances.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of electorate: More than 13 million people were eligible to vote in the snap election, underscoring the national scale of the contest .</li><li>Poll and market signals: Polls show a tight, three-way contest while online betting markets have placed a narrow advantage with the main centre-right party over Wilders&#x27; PVV, reflecting high uncertainty .</li><li>Parties&#x27; stance: Several major centre-right and Christian democratic parties have publicly ruled out forming a coalition with the Freedom Party (PVV), reducing the PVV&#x27;s practical prospects of governing even if it wins a plurality .</li><li>Undecided voters: Roughly half the electorate remained undecided in the run-up to polling day, a factor analysts say is making final outcomes unpredictable .</li><li>Campaign themes: Housing shortages, migration policy and debates over EU and Ukraine policy dominated campaign headlines and voter concerns across multiple parties .</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Geert Wilders / PVV: Wilders campaigned for a second victory seeking to press his anti-immigration and anti-Islam agenda and to regain policy momentum after a fractious period in government.
