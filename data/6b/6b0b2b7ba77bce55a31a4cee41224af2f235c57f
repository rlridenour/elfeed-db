<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 3 licenses for <a href="https://cleanshot.com/">CleanShot X</a>. That&rsquo;s right, another shot at a CleanShot X license! I love CleanShot X like I&rsquo;ve never loved a screenshot app before. Everything about it is elegant without sacrificing any power. It can do everything, from basic screenshots to annotation to video to adding backgrounds. It even offers cloud sharing.</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It feels like 7 apps in one.</p>

  <p>CleanShot X provides over 50 features making it the ultimate screen capturing tool.</p>
