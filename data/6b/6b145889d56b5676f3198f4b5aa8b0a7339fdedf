In select U.S. states, residents can <a href="https://learn.wallet.apple/id">add their driver's license or state ID to the Apple Wallet app</a> on the iPhone and Apple Watch, and then use it to display proof of identity or age at select airports and businesses, and in select apps.<br/>

Earlier this week, Illinois became the 13th state in the U.S. to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/19/apple-wallet-id-now-live-in-illinois/">offer the feature</a>. Subsequently, we shared a list of additional states that are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/19/wallet-app-drivers-licenses-all-states/">committed to offering the feature</a> in the future, as previously announced by Apple:<ul><li>Connecticut</li><br/>
<li>Kentucky</li><br/>
<li>Mississippi</li><br/>
<li>Oklahoma</li><br/>
<li>Utah</li></ul>As it turns out, two more states have "signed on to adopt ID in Apple Wallet in the future," according to their <a href="https://www.dfa.arkansas.gov/office/driver-services/mobile-id/">government</a> <a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/licenses-ids/mobile-id">websites</a>:<ul><li>Arkansas</li><br/>
<li>Virginia</li></ul>Arkansas launched a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arkansas-mobile-id/id6596562568">mobile ID app</a> in August. It works with Google Wallet and Samsung Wallet, and Apple Wallet support is coming later.<br/>
<br/>
Virginia launched a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/virginia-mobile-id/id6480013606">mobile ID app</a> last week, and it <a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/news/virginia-dmv-launches-mobile-id">announced</a> it will "prepare for integration with digital wallets" in the "coming months."<br/>
<br/>
Apple Wallet IDs are accepted at TSA checkpoints in more than 250 airports in the U.S., for domestic travel. Given that Apple Wallet IDs are not accepted by law enforcement, and lack many other use cases, carrying a physical ID is still necessary.<br/>
<br/>
To set up the feature, open the Wallet app and tap on the plus sign in the top-right corner. Next, select Driver's License and ID Cards and follow the steps.<br/>
<br/>
If you live in a state that does not yet offer Apple Wallet IDs, you can now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/12/apple-launches-digital-id-passport-feature/">create a Digital ID based on your U.S. passport</a>, and present it at the same participating TSA checkpoints, for age and identity verification purposes during domestic travel. It is not a replacement for a physical passport, and it cannot be used for international travel.<br/>
