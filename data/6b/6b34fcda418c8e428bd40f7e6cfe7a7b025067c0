About The Emacs Cat My first attempt to dive into the vast ocean of Emacs was in 1997, over 25 years ago.
My first attempt was unsuccessful; I now realize I couldn’t fully grasp the spirit of Emacs at the time.
My second—and successful—attempt came in 2012. Since then, I’ve been using Emacs for nearly everything, from coding in C++ and Python to maintaining my knowledge base with org-roam and writing articles in LaTeX.
