<p>Hurricane Melissa tore through the northern Caribbean this week, killing about 49 people and flattening communities in Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba as authorities began search, rescue and cleanup operations . Melissa made landfall in Jamaica as an exceptionally strong storm and then moved north toward Bermuda, bringing continued hurricane-force conditions to the Atlantic . Officials and scientists say climate change likely helped fuel the storm’s intensity, and international and U.S.-based relief groups are rushing aid while local authorities struggle to reach isolated areas .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PXSo_lYFZN4WHmuIKyL1GkrZTj1vE7eDMQjo9ghZwsDKSJU3Kmf8fe76Sxbt_VjYPjsF0fqYqGm6X8ovhbOIXEGXhLtArsHaf2DXyHHs9qWgZLzaRub0B3_U0WicumfUkS4-67cNrG0iwrvFKzR4KHBnBWk3jm0waFXXLRtKR6MPAZPKoykz3-NgSSFOIND1d-SoQOsn-rUJOQSQeztnI78X4Mz3kEbp7HKrSA' alt='Destruction at Treasure Beach, St. Elizabeth, Jamaica, after Melissa struck the island as a Category 5 hurricane' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Local destruction: Western Jamaica reported catastrophic housing damage — around 90% of homes in Black River lost roofs or were destroyed — complicating shelter needs .</li><li>Power and shelter: Thousands remain in temporary shelters and roughly two-thirds of Jamaica was still without power days after Melissa passed, hampering recovery .</li><li>Aid mobilization: U.S.-based relief organizations and search-and-rescue teams moved supplies and personnel into affected areas to support local responders .</li><li>Policy ripple: Some climate analysts say Melissa will push adaptation and resilience higher on the agenda ahead of COP30, emphasizing preparedness over prevention alone .</li></ul><blockquote>We will see adaptation and resilience really at the center, because we just can’t avoid the question of impacts anymore - Unnamed expert</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Jamaica information minister: Officials confirmed multiple fatalities and said search-and-rescue efforts were ongoing across the island as teams worked to reach cut-off communities.
