</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Recording thoughts on how I might better align my #blogging and private #journaling.  Closing out with some #Emacs code, that positions me to remove a large dependency.
</p>
        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>What follows is my thinking through and exploring the interplay of blogging and
private journaling along with developing ideas; furthering inquiry.  It is
“stream of thought” with little refinement early on.  Instead, the refinement
arrives when I start outlining my solution.</p>
<h1 id="enter-the-stream-of-thought">Enter the Stream (of Thought)</h1>
<p>Organizing my notes has become a consideration of mine.  My personal glossary is
a mix of files.  But that is proving to not be the place to develop ideas;
something I’m feeling strongly about doing.  Why?  Because I’m interested in a
more philosophical life; one that favors inquiry.</p>
<p>Jenny just finished <cite>Tiny Beautiful Things</cite>, a book comprised of
letters to an advice column, and the underlying response.  Which invariably took
the form of “the answer is within you.”  And I’m working through <cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite> by Agnes Callard, in which Callard argues (convincingly) that inquiry and
thinking are a social exercise, requiring two people to engage in moving towards
truth and away from error.</p>
<h1 id="thinking-about-organization">Thinking about Organization</h1>
<p>So why this growing compulsion to reconsider my organizational processes?  I
have chosen a bit of a “loose leaf” approach, with tags to help bring some
structure to this pile of digital files.  Yet I realized a few things, in part
from my effort to move my bibliography into my note taking plus my capturing of
quotes close to the bibliographic record.</p>
<p><i class="new-thought">Those realizations being</i>that I can consolidate this information into
a singular location.  I have many glossary terms; and I could move that
information to a single file.  Maybe that’s a better approach.</p>
<p>Second, in my journaling habit, I’m tending to create blog posts within an
entry.  Which I can copy to a blog document (which is then transformed to a
markdown file, which is then transformed to an HTML file that is sent out into
the world).  In other words, different projections of the same core concept.
There is also the drive to ensure that my journal is printed.  Something I also
want to do with my blog.  I do have a suitable print style sheet for the
web-pages.  To print <em>en masse</em> would mean to create some printable views.</p>
<p>Then there is a consideration of effort.  Paired with the adage <em>make the change
easy, then make the easy change</em>.  That is, were I to implement something for
developing thought, my intuition (honed by professional activities) is that
something in my present approach will need to change.  And that there is prior
work, but I’m uncertain about the applicability of some of the functional
processes (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a>).</p>
<p>So let’s clarify and state the problem: Namely, what does developing an idea
look like?  First, a blog and journal have a temporal linearity to them (I write
today in today’s slot, tomorrow in tomorrow’s).  As time moves, so does the
“window” in which I typically frame my writing.  Similarly a blog is often “the
most recent posts at the foreground.”</p>
<p>I think I’m skirting around with the idea of a digital garden.  While also
wrestling with this wonderful habit I’ve established of journaling.  Something I
don’t want to jeopardize, and see as a habit with which I might stack idea
development; that is coming back to a topic even as the temporal window of much
of my writing processes moves past it’s point of origin.</p>
<p>I have this journal, which at the time of writing is some 11,500 lines in a
file.  I can imagine a situation in which I develop ideas in the journal;
another location but one within the same file.  This might afford some technical
niceties provided by the writing mode (e.g., radio targets for wiki like
linking).</p>
<p>However, I’m also considering a known weakness of the format, namely that <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>
and <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a> struggle with large files.  I have not yet noticed that struggle,
so perhaps what I have is not a large file.  But I can assume that were I to
continue with this habit, I would encounter that threshold.  And it is unknown
what that is (and I don’t really want to explore).  So I’m mentally considering
any solution as needing to have multiple files.</p>
<p>Here are some considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each year has its own journal; as part of my “Happy New Year”, I create a
journal file for the year, and update my code to begin capturing to that
journal.</li>
<li>My “ideas in development” (e.g. those that I continue to groom and tend) are
in their own file.</li>
<li>I use a dynamic block to make those ideas present in the journal (for
referencing via radio targets…if that works with dynamism, something to test).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, all journals have access to the ideas under development.  I can
also envision moving blog posts into respective “journals” for each year.  Or
some could move to their respective “series”, which themselves are ideas in
development.</p>
<p>I had done much of this kind of work when I moved my epigraph files into a
central file.  Made possible, only when I identified that I wanted to improve my
tracking of a personal bibliography; namely adding just a bit of “time
tracking.”</p>
<p>The glossary is a bit of a separate concern, one that is orthogonal to
developing ideas.  That is this can linger a bit longer in an unresolved state.
The “write a blog from my journal” is a bit different.  In shifting a blog entry
to a headline, I now introduce the ability to “refile” that entry.  Either via
the refile command, or by cutting the containing headline and pasting it into a
more appropriate location.  Conforming past posts to this process and making
this process work going forward are also separable tasks.</p>
<p>I think this also means that the <code>nt</code> portion of my journal capture might be
short-lived.  Instead favoring a point in time in the headline; something I’ve
done before but considered perhaps not worth tracking as it creates additional
metadata of my activity.  Albeit alterable.</p>
<p>What I’m also considering is that my blog posts and glossary entries “clutter”
the directory.  Again, the idea of “loose leaf papers” feels aprapos.  There is
also an aspect of de-prioritizing the blog post and glossary items relative to
what is in that directory.  In other words, shifting those concepts into
corresponding index files.</p>
<p>While typing out a bullet list, I realized that <em>ideas</em> may be wrong, but
instead could be <em>questions</em>, points of <em>inquiry</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Glossary</li>
<li>Inquiry</li>
<li>Journal, private and public (e.g. a blog post)</li>
</ul>
<p>Removing those blog posts and glossary entries from the directory, would clear
space for other things.  That is reduce their gravity mass in a directory
listing; or more move that gravity into the file size metadata.</p>
<h1 id="focus-time-or-i-couldve-been-reading-but-chose-coding">Focus Time, or I Could’ve Been Reading but Chose Coding</h1>
<p>I did spend time <time datetime="2025-07-31" title="2025-07-31">yesterday</time> and <time datetime="2025-08-01" title="2025-08-01">today</time> work working out the start of exporting
headlines.  There’s some bumps, and I’m considering a deeper refactor.  Namely
how I might skip using the <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co">Ox-Hugo</a> package (which is feature complete <del>but
apparently not maintained</del>) and instead use the more general markdown exporter as
the baseline.</p>
<p>Related to this work, I realized that I could mark this journal entry as <code>TODO</code>
and it would show up the <code>Org-Agenda</code> menu.  I’m considering what that will mean,
but I think it helps on posts in development as well as personal inquiry, namely
using the todo status of <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of this entry, I realized I had more to “develop” so I tagged it as
<code>TODO</code>; maybe there’s other <code>TODO</code> keywords to consider.  I see the <code>DRAFT</code> and
<code>PUBLISHED</code> as a coupled pair.  And there’s <code>TODO</code>, <code>DONE</code> (maybe <code>ABANDONED</code>?)  There
might be a <code>DEVELOPING</code> state between <code>TODO</code> and <code>DONE</code>.</p>
<h1 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co">Ox-Hugo</a> package <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a> derives from a Blackfriday exporter which derives
from the Markdown exporter (which derives from the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>).  A biblical begats if
you will.</p>
<p>For my initial work, with the help of the <abbr title="Read-eval-print loop">REPL</abbr>; I set about the logic of
validating I had a blog post to export and then setting values I’d use to write
to the front-matter.</p>
<p>This became the <a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs/blob/1c7e2102d612df4671dcbac891be945fe703c1a6/emacs.d/ox-hugo-simple.el#L27-L102">export-blog-post-to-takeonrules</a> function, which would be the
means project my <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a> post into <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> Markdown.  The inline comments of this
function tell the majority of the story.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validate that we’re in a blog post</li>
<li>Set important metadata for the blog post</li>
<li>Save the buffer</li>
<li>Then perform the export of that blog post</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
<p>I set about configuring a <code>takeonrules</code> exporter via the
<code>org-export-define-derived-backend</code> function (<a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs/blob/1c7e2102d612df4671dcbac891be945fe703c1a6/emacs.d/ox-hugo-simple.el#L15-L25">see configuration on Github</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(org-export-define-derived-backend 'takeonrules 'md
  :translate-alist
  '(
     (footnote-reference . org-hugo-simple-footnote-reference)
     (inner-template . org-hugo-simple-inner-template)
     (timestamp . org-hugo-simple-timestamp)
     )
  :filters-alist
  '((:filter-body org-hugo-simple-body-filter))
  :options-alist
  '((:with-toc nil &quot;toc&quot; nil)))
</code></pre>
<p>Under the hood, what’s happening is that we copy the Markdown exporter
configuration, merge into that copy the above configuration.  And this was all
that I immediately needed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export a more semantic <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> element for a timestamp</li>
<li>Export footnotes as sidenotes</li>
<li>Ensure that I write the correct front-matter for the blog post.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent a few hours refining this, and preserving the previous method.  At some
point, I’ll evaluate if I remove the old approach and the dependency on both the
<a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co">Ox-Hugo</a> package and the <code>ox-blackfriday</code> package.  I love what both of those
packages allowed for me in my earlier days of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>.  And now, with a better
understanding of the export implementation, I can use an implementation specific
to my “needs.”</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This post is a mix of how I think and move from thinking to doing.  I also think
there’s likely some people who might appreciate the implementation details of
the custom exporter (<a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs/blob/1c7e2102d612df4671dcbac891be945fe703c1a6/emacs.d/ox-hugo-simple.el">the code is up on Github</a>).  The time I spent writing and
thinking through the problem helped me avoid some potential dead-ends.</p>
