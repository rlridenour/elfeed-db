<p>There are a lot of angles to AI and productivity emerging right now. One I’ve come to appreciate is AI-based smarter autocomplete. My tool of choice for this is <a href="https://cotypist.app">Cotypist</a>. It’s made by a trusted Mac developer, it’s fast, and it takes privacy seriously.</p>



<p>Unlike many AI writing tools that require you to work within their specific interface, Cotypist works in virtually any text field across your Mac. Whether you&#8217;re drafting an email, writing in your favorite text editor, or filling out a form, Cotypist is there to help speed up your writing.</p>



<p>The app&#8217;s latest version (.9) brings notable improvements to both performance and completion qualityand new AI models that give even better completions. It even respects your Mac&#8217;s Smart Quotes preferences – a small but meaningful touch that shows attention to detail.</p>



<p>With Cotypist turned on, it offers inline completions that appear in real time. Then you’ve got a few options:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You could just ignore the suggestion and keep typing like you’ve always done.</li>



<li>If you want to accept the full multi-word suggestion, you press a user-defined key. (I use the backtick – just above the Tab key on a US keyboard.)</li>



<li>If you just want to accept the next suggest word, you hit another user-defined key (I use Tab)</li>



<li>If you want to dismiss the suggestion entirely, press escape. (This is handy when doing online forms, for instance.)</li>
</ul>



<p>At first, the constant suggestions may feel distracting, but once I adapted to it, I can’t imagine going back.</p>



<p>Cotypist generates all completions locally on your Mac. No cloud services, no data sharing – just your Mac&#8217;s processing power working to speed up your writing.</p>



<p>Like I said,&nbsp;<a href="https://cotypist.app/">Cotypist</a>&nbsp;represents an interesting take on AI and is worth checking out.</p>
