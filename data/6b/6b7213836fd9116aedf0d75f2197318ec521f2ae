<p>Police in New Zealand say they have successfully recovered a limited-edition Fabergé egg pendant, valued at about NZ$33,000 (around US$19,000), after a suspect allegedly swallowed it while being confronted over a jewellery-store theft in Auckland last week. Officers monitored the 32-year-old man&#x27;s bowel movements for six days until the James Bond Octopussy-inspired diamond-studded pendant passed naturally, avoiding the need for surgery or other medical intervention. Police said staff remained with the man around the clock in custody during the wait, and the pendant has now been returned to the investigation as evidence. The suspect faces dishonesty and driving-related charges in relation to the alleged attempted theft and his subsequent attempt to flee the scene in a vehicle.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/5h5gfJxrc94bHtxn5iWwuDdFQVQRosjIgNfMVLjsh6--s4xQxN9D360St_Q3DbCPYapUKOAo8_z8htntLuDUpm5Im9MC5JTTlIHeCOQsrjZmw_NxBxwc_n_JdeBXvmNnbkD8mwxSizSfF5Cx5BmzSPZ_NvURGkA' alt='New Zealand police say a limited-edition Fabergé egg pendant has been safely recovered as evidence after six days.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Bond film link: The recovered pendant is a green, diamond-encrusted Fabergé egg from a limited series inspired by the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy, which also features jewel-smuggling involving a counterfeit Fabergé egg.</li><li>Store confrontation: Police said the man allegedly put the pendant in his mouth after staff at the luxury jewellery store became suspicious and challenged him, before fleeing and being arrested shortly afterward.</li><li>Medical oversight: Authorities stated that health professionals advised monitoring and allowing the item to pass on its own, and that the suspect did not require hospitalisation or invasive procedures during the six-day observation.</li><li>Custody conditions: Officers were tasked with continuously checking the suspect&#x27;s waste during his time in custody, with police later describing their efforts as &#x27;patient&#x27; given the unusual circumstances of the investigation.</li><li>Legal next steps: With the pendant recovered and catalogued as evidence, the suspect is expected to appear again in court as the case proceeds through New Zealand&#x27;s criminal justice system on the dishonesty and related charges already filed.</li></ul><blockquote>Police can confirm that the Fabergé pendant has been recovered and is now part of the ongoing investigation. - New Zealand Police spokesperson</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>New Zealand Police: Police emphasised that they followed medical advice to let the pendant exit the suspect&#x27;s system naturally and framed the outcome as a successful recovery of important evidence after an unusually monitored six days.
