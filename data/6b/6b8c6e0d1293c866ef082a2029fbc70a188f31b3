Below, we recap key changes rumored for the iPhone 17 Pro models, <strong>as of July 2025</strong>:<ul><li><strong>Aluminum frame:</strong> iPhone 17 Pro models are rumored to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-pro-models-aluminum-frame-rumor/">have an aluminum frame</a>, whereas the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have a titanium frame, and the iPhone X through iPhone 14 Pro have a stainless steel frame.

<li><strong>Anti-reflective display:</strong> While it has been an on-again, off-again rumor, the latest word is that iPhone 17 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/iphone-17-pro-anti-reflective-display/">will feature an anti-reflect display option</a> with a matte finish. Perhaps this will be the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/27/ipad-nano-texture-glass-hands-on/">nano-texture glass option</a> that is available for the iMac, MacBook Pro, and iPad Pro.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Dynamic Island changes:</strong> It has been rumored that all iPhone 17 models will have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/iphone-17-new-dynamic-island-ui-rumor/">redesigned Dynamic Island interface</a> — it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/iphone-17-metalens-rumor/">might also be smaller</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Rectangular camera bump:</strong> iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/iphone-17-pro-no-two-tone-rear-design/">large rectangular camera bump</a> with rounded corners. Apple apparently plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/iphone-17-pro-to-stick-with-triangular-camera/">stick with a triangular arrangement</a> for the rear camera lenses.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Longer battery life:</strong> The iPhone 17 Pro Max is rumored to have a slightly thicker design that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-pro-max-thicker-larger-battery/">allows for a larger battery</a>. The iPhone 17 Pro Max will apparently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/03/iphone-17-pro-max-battery-capacity-leaked/">surpass the 5,000 mAh battery capacity mark</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>A19 Pro chip:</strong> iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to use Apple's next-generation A19 Pro chip, which will reportedly be manufactured <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/a19-and-a19-pro-n3p-rumor/">with TSMC's newer third-generation 3nm process</a>.

This upgrade should help to improve the performance of Apple Intelligence and multitasking. All four iPhone 16 models have 8GB of RAM.</li><br/>
<li><strong>25W wireless charging:</strong> iPhone 17 Pro models will likely support up to 25W wireless charging speeds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/iphone-17-models-25w-wireless-third-party-chargers/">with a wide variety of Qi 2.2 chargers</a>.

<li><strong>Dual video recording:</strong> According to Jon Prosser, of the YouTube channel Front Page Tech, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will allow users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/iphone-17-pro-dual-video-recording-rumor/">record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously</a> in the Camera app.</li><br/>
