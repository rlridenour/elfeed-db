The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-fifth-developer-beta-watchos-26/">fifth tvOS 26 beta</a> changed several "HomeKit" references to "Apple Home" in the Settings app on all Apple TV models compatible with the update.<br/>

For example, <a href="https://theverifier.co.il/74242/apple-home-replaces-homekit/">Israeli website <em>The Verifier</em> reported</a> that the "AirPlay and HomeKit" menu on the Apple TV is now labeled "AirPlay and Apple Home."<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris spotted other examples, such as the one below.<br/>
<br/>
Before:<blockquote>Your Apple TV won't connect with iCloud and HomeKit until you add a new default user.</blockquote>After:<blockquote>Your Apple TV won't connect with iCloud and Apple Home until you add a new default user.</blockquote>As a refresher, Apple Home refers to Apple's overall smart home app and ecosystem, whereas HomeKit has been the name of the company's underlying smart home accessory framework since 2014. Of the two names, HomeKit sounds more technical.<br/>
<br/>
Does this serve as evidence that Apple is slowly phasing out its HomeKit brand in favor of Apple Home, or did Apple simply realize that Apple Home was the better wording in these instances? It could be the latter, but it would not be surprising if Apple eventually did retire the HomeKit name in favor of the more generic Apple Home for both its smart home app and framework, especially as the company prepares to launch an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/13/heres-why-apples-home-hub-is-delayed/">all-new home hub</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For now, there are still plenty of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102056">references to both HomeKit</a> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102287">and Apple Home</a> across Apple's website and software platforms. One day, though, perhaps the HomeKit name could be folded into Apple Home entirely for streamlined branding.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/09/tvos-26-homekit-changed-to-apple-home/">tvOS 26 Changes &#039;HomeKit&#039; References to &#039;Apple Home&#039; in Settings App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tvos-26-changes-homekit-references-to-apple-home-in-settings-app.2463099/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
