Yesterday, signs of the second-generation Studio Display with the codename J427 were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-still-working-on-studio-display-2/">spotted in Apple code</a>. Now, it has emerged that the device will contain the as-yet unreleased A19 Pro chip. The A19 Pro is almost certain to debut in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max next month.<br/>
<br/>
The Studio Display's chip supports features like Center Stage, Spatial Audio, and "Hey <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>" commands. The current Studio Display launched in 2022 with the A13 Bionic, a chip that started out in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 11 lineup back in 2019.<br/>

Rumors suggest that the next-generation Studio Display will come out in early 2026, when we're also expecting new Macs. Little is known about the new Studio Display, but it could feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">mini-LED backlighting</a> for improved brightness, contrast, and color.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77">Mac Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/">&#039;A19 Pro&#039; Chip Coming to Studio Display 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2.2463359/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
