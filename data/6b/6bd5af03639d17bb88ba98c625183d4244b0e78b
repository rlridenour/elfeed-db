<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s such a wild idea that I&#8217;ve never heard it in the public discourse.<br />
Even saying it seems so far outside the Overton window that it makes nuking hurricanes sound reasonable (as some politicians proposed).<br />
But why? It makes perfect sense. The financial incentives to create addictive digital content would instantly disappear, and so would the mechanisms that allow both commercial and political actors to create personalized, reality-distorting bubbles</p></blockquote>

<p>Back in my early aughts corporate days I pitched blocking all on-line advertising as much as we could. My intent was for security: we were obviously too vulnerable to click-bait malware and watering hole attacks, among others. It was a major problem, but leadership – especially the former cop who headed up corporate security – was rarely swayed by a security argument that didn&#8217;t have some physical component to it.</p>
<p>My pitch was that advertisers were eating up our limited Internet bandwidth, forcing us to buy more for little additional return. I ran stats for months based on the then-current block lists. I don&#8217;t remember the ratio off hand, but it was significant. Everyone I showed the information to was wowed by the findings.</p>
<p>Yet, the powers that be said no, and for perhaps the most mundane of reasons: if we blocks others&#8217; ads, they might block ours in return. It was also an absurd reason as the company at the time did no direct to consumer sales or advertising.</p>
<p>I tried to re-pitch the idea with security baked in, but it was a non-starter.</p>
<p>My boss was not a fan of the idea but for a totally different reason. He loved ads. He loved targeted ads. He loved that the advertisers knew he owned a boat and listened to Howard Stern and would let him know about all the great things he could by that hit on one, the other, or both. I loved Dean, but I never understood that.</p>
<p>The other argument was <em>how can we have nice free things on the Internet if we don&#8217;t allow advertising</em>? Advertising is just another way to pay for something, just without end-user agency. It&#8217;s an agreement between the site and the advertiser of which we all are bound but cannot negotiate on our own behalf.</p>
<p>I have content blocked for 20+ years in various ways. I go out of my way to not see ads. When I end up in a place where I have to use someone else&#8217;s computer or watch TV events like the Super Bowl, I cannot believe what I see. I cannot believe people put up with all the noise and unnecessary consumerism.</p>
<p>All that is to say that I really like this article from Kōdō Simone. I am on board 100%.</p>
