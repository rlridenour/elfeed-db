<p>President Trump is hosting Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) President Félix Tshisekedi in Washington for the signing of a US-brokered peace accord intended to ease long-running tensions and fighting in eastern Congo along the Rwandan border. The agreement aims to halt support for armed groups, normalize relations between Kigali and Kinshasa, and create conditions for greater American investment in the region’s rich deposits of cobalt and other minerals used in global supply chains. The deal has been negotiated under US mediation and includes provisions granting US companies preferred access to some of the DRC’s critical mineral resources in exchange for security commitments and development pledges. However, heavy clashes continue in eastern DRC, where Rwanda-backed M23 rebels are advancing, raising questions about how quickly the accord can translate into safety for civilians on the ground.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PqIzpf-aPSnblUvmmBLjvWDwNiH2tLXutRmjo3O2kodhHDzFU-Yavlfz5Yxsdf5GCGBsOBJ_DQH8Z0j6-FkPriFvDgW3KDgHiV6NQh5d27FqW14yGEF4zoEBxC384vPJHkwoflAzHUBJiNiwyPbRODaEILyMR67_auWrlAvpAg' alt='President Trump speaks at the White House ahead of welcoming the leaders of DR Congo and Rwanda for a peace accord signing.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Role of Washington: The accord will be signed at the White House, with the US acting as guarantor and seeking to turn its diplomatic clout into both a security framework and an economic partnership centered on Congolese minerals.</li><li>Mineral access: The deal is expected to give American firms priority in accessing DRC reserves of cobalt and other battery metals, part of a US push to diversify supply chains away from dependence on China.</li><li>Local skepticism: Communities and civil society groups in eastern Congo have expressed doubts that an elite-level agreement abroad will stop attacks and displacement unless armed groups are disarmed and regional powers halt covert support to militias.</li><li>US Institute renaming: Ahead of the ceremony, the US Institute of Peace added President Trump’s name to its building, a move timed to coincide with his role in hosting the DR Congo–Rwanda negotiations.</li><li>Ongoing M23 advance: Even as the leaders prepare to sign in Washington, M23 rebels described as backed by Rwanda have made rapid gains in North Kivu, underscoring how fragile any ceasefire arrangements will be at the start.</li></ul><blockquote>There can be no lasting peace without justice and accountability for the people who have borne the brunt of this conflict. - Unnamed Congolese civil society representative</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US government: US officials frame the accord as both a step toward ending three decades of violence in eastern Congo and a way to secure more reliable access to critical minerals for American industry.
