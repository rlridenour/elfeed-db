<p><code>fzf</code> is a tool that you can use to select items from a list. I think it&rsquo;s most
popularly used to search your shell history (as a <code>Ctrl+R</code> replacement in bash).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve honestly still never found a use for <code>fzf</code> myself (other than <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf.vim</a> which is amazing) but I just learned that
you can use it to review a git commit like this and I thought that was really
cool. You can scroll up and down through the files on the left and it&rsquo;ll
display the diff on the right:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
commit=${1:-HEAD}
git show --stat=120 --format=&quot;&quot; &quot;$commit&quot; | \
           grep '|' | \
           fzf --ansi \
               --disabled \
               --bind 'j:down,k:up,q:abort' \
               --preview=&quot;echo {} | sed 's/ *|.*//' | xargs -I% git show --color=always $commit -- %&quot; \
               --preview-window=right:60%
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <code>fzf</code> as a sort of &ldquo;jq playground&rdquo; like this:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

printf '' | fzf --print-query \
  --preview &quot;jq -C {q} '$1' 2&gt;&amp;1&quot; \
  --preview-window=up:80%
</code></pre>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s really cool that you can use fzf (which is theoretically a search
tool) to implement lots of UIs that aren&rsquo;t doing search at all, like these two!</p>
