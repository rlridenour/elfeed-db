<p>Writing in the <em>New Yorker</em> in 1949, John Davenport documented a rising language he&#8217;d observed among his countrymen. He called it Slurvian. &#8220;When Slurvians travel abroad, they go to visit farn (or forn) countries to see what the farners do that&#8217;s different from the way we Murcans do things. While in farn countries, they refer to themselves as Murcan tersts, and usually say they will be mighty glad to get back to Murca.&#8221;</p>
