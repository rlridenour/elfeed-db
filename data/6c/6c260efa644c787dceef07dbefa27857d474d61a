<li>Little TVs</li>
<li>Like really little. The screens are 1.75” diagonal</li>
<li>One shows clips from <em>Jurassic Park</em></li>
<li>The other shows clips from <em>Star Trek</em></li>
<li>The remote works</li>
<li>Are they Mac-compatible: No, these are way too stupid and nostalgic to be an Apple product</li>
</ul><h1>Little Screens</h1><p>This is perhaps the most extreme version of a “Well, hey, for the price, why not?” sale we’ve ever done.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>It’s a tiny television that runs on AAA batteries. It comes with a remote. It plays short clips from <em>Star Trek</em> or <em>Jurassic Park</em>. And…</p>
<p>Well…</p>
<p>There is no ‘and.’ That’s it. That’s the whole product.</p>
<p>So, imagine now, if you went over to someone’s house and they had one of these. And imagine you said, “Whoa, what is that thing?” And they said, “It’s a little TV that plays clips, and it came with a real remote!” And you asked, “How much did you pay for it?” And they said, “Twenty-five dollars.”</p>
<p>You’d start to reconsider your relationship with that person.</p>
<p>Like, seriously, is it healthy for you to be spending time with someone who drops that much money on something that stupid?</p>
<p>But, friends, we’ve got it for just $9.99!</p>
<p>As discussed yesterday, that’s about the price you pay for a drink at Starbucks these days. And no, those drinks don’t have any alcohol in them (we asked). And what’s more, if you bring your own alcohol to add to them, they make you leave, even if you offer to pay a corking fee. WTF?!</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is, for about ten bucks, you don’t need a reason to buy this.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s going to be a prop in some sort of elaborate miniature Halloween or Christmas mantle scene.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re going to get it to add to your kid’s Barbie house, because all Ken ever watches is Disney Junior shows, and it’s about time he learn about some television and movies from the good old days.</p>
<p>Or maybe you recently lifted your gerbils out of their habitat and said, “Beam me up, Scotty!” only for them to stare at you blankly, and you’re worried about their cultural illiteracy. So you’re buying one for them.</p>
<p>The reason’s not important. Because it’s only 10 bucks.</p>
<p>So buy one!</p>
