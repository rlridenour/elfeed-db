According to a post from the leaker known as "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Instant Digital</a>," there may be at least six new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models to choose from in 2027. From the unveiling of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18e in the first half of 2027 until the fall announcement of the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 19 models, the lineup could look like this:<br/>

Earlier this year, Analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> reported that Apple plans to split new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineups <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/base-iphone-18-spring-2027-launch/">between two launch windows annually</a>. The &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models and the first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will arrive in the second half of 2026, while the standard &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18e will follow in the first half of 2027. <br/>

Apple is also highly likely to keep some other, older &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models on sale. Today, it still offers the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus alongside the five <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. Until February, it also still sold the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Plus. As a result, this year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> will probably stick around in 2027, meaning that there could be the biggest ever variety of new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models available from Apple at a single time. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/22/six-different-new-iphones-in-2027/">Apple Could Offer Six Different New iPhone Models in 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-could-offer-six-different-new-iphone-models-in-2027.2462009/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
