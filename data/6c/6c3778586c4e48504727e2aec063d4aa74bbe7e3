<br/>
<b>2:21 pm</b>: Wearables, Home and Accessories saw revenue of &#36;11.5 billion, down 2%. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a> were constrained, and if not for those constraints, Apple believes the category would have grown in the quarter. Customer satisfaction on Apple Watch was 96%, with more than half of Apple Watch buyers new to the product.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:22 pm</b>: Services revenue was &#36;30 billion, up 14% year over year, with all time revenue records on advertising, music, payment services and cloud services. Double digit growth on paid subscribers. Install base of 2.5 billion active devices gives "an incredibly strong foundation for new growth opportunities."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:23 pm</b>: Now he's discussing enterprise growth, noting deployment of Macs at Snowflake, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pros at AstraZeneca, and MacBook Airs at Coppel in Mexico.<br/>

<br/>
<b>2:25 pm</b>: Expects March quarter total company revenue will grow 13 to 16%, and services revenue to grow a ta year over year rate similar to December. Gross margin to be between 48% and 49%. Operating expenses between &#36;18.4 and &#36;18.7 billion driven by higher R&D costs. Tax rate around 17.5%. Dividend of &#36;0.26 per share in mid February.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:25 pm</b>: The Q&A session with analysts is beginning.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:28 pm</b>: Q: A lot of focus on the impact of memory. Can we get some of your perspective on that guiding gross margins and your comfort in securing for shipment? How do we think about memory inflation over time?<br/>
<br/>
A: We were thrilled with customer response to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; grow 23%. We exited the December quarter with very lean channel inventory due to that staggering level of demand. We're in a supply chase mode to meet the very high levels of customer demand. We are current constrained and it is difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance the constraints. It's driven by the availability in the advanced nodes that our SOCs are produced on and we are seeing less flexibility in supply chain than normal, partly because of the increased demand that I just spoke about.<br/>
<br/>
From a memory point of view, memory had a minimal impact on Q1 December gross margin, we expect more of an impact in Q2 gross margin and that was comprehended in the outlook of 48 to 49% that Kevan gave earlier. We don't provide outlook beyond the current quarter, but we do see market pricing for memory increasing significantly. We'll look at a range of options to deal with that.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:30 pm</b>: Q: In China, can you touch on the strength you had? I think this is very close to all time revenue records. What's driving the strength over there?<br/>
<br/>
A: Greater China was up 38% driven by &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, best &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; quarter in history in China. Traffic in our stores grew by strong double digit year over year. Installed base reached an all time high, and we set an all time record for the upgraders and iPhones were the top three smartphones in urban China during the quarter. It was really driven by product strength and customer response to the product strength. On non-iPhone customers, the majority on Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Watch, they're still new to the product. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; was the top tablet in Urban China, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> was the top-selling laptop, and &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; was the top selling Desktop model in the December quarter. We could not be more happy with it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:32 pm</b>: Q: On the partnership with Google, can you help us understand what the revenue upside potential that exists with AI? Many of your competitors have already integrated AI into their devices, and it's just not clear yet what incremental monetization they're seeing because of AI, but you're always disciplined with investing you obviously have a differentiated product. So, how do you monetize AI and what's the timeline to realizing that ROI?<br/>
<br/>
A: We're bringing intelligence to more of what people love, and we're integrating it across the operating system in a personal and private way. And I think that by doing so, it creates great value, and that opens up a range of opportunities across our products and services. We're very happy with the collaboration with Google as well, I should add.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: Q: Can you maybe help us understand what the primary factors are driving strength in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;? I'm sure there's a number of factors, but if you if you had to point to one or two, just what would they be and how sustainable do you think those are? <br/>
<br/>
A: I think it's different for different cohorts of where people are coming from in the device that they have, but it's a combination of things always that make the product sing. It's the display, it's the camera, it's the performance, it's the new selfie camera, it's the design, the design is beloved, and so it's it's all of these things that that, that come together at once, and have are producing a very strong product cycle, as witnessed by our December quarter results.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:34 pm</b>: Q: Encouraging to hear of the revenue growth outlook for the March quarter, can you talk about any comps that we should be aware of as we think about the product categories, last year you had M4 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, are there tough comps or is it less of an issue?<br/>
<br/>
A: Wouldn't say there's any comp issue that we would note, there's nothing that rises to that outlook but just a continue of the strong cycle that we're seeing subject to the constraints that we've already mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:35 pm</b>: Q: On services, advertising was strong in the quarter. Wanted to ask about some of the new growth opportunities in advertising, new ad slots in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Can you talk about that and any plans to do more in advertising across other products like maps or TV?<br/>
<br/>
A: In general, we saw really good broad-based performance in our cross-services business, all-time records in advertising, music, payment services and cloud services — really good opportunities. Wallet, digital ID, and new ads in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. We'll continue to look for ways to expand opportunities to add value to users and to Apple, 2.5 billion active devices makes us excited about the opportunities that provides for our services business.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:37 pm</b>: Q: On the Google partnership, how did you come to that decision with AI and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in particular? If there's an opportunity there for you guys to share in revenue too with that partnership like you do in Search?<br/>
<br/>
A: We determined that Google's AI technology would provide the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models. We believe that we can unlock a lot of experiences and innovate in a key way due to the collaboration. We'll continue to run on the device and run in private cloud compute and maintain our industry leading privacy standards in doing so. In terms of doing the arrangement with Google, we're not releasing the details of that.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:39 pm</b>: Q: On gross margin, I'm pretty shocked that you're able to do 48-49%. What's really going on there? How are you doing that with these memory NAN prices? Is it mix, less hardware and more services? How are you doing it?<br/>
<br/>
A: Let me reflect on Q1 gross margin, landing at 48.2%, we were up 100 basis points sequentially, we talk about favorable mix. When we have a strong product cycle, that does lend itself to more favorable opportunity on the leverage side. Products were up sequentially by 450 basis points, the Services business growing double-digit, similar guidance to December. We see favorable mix, and normal puts and takes, but we feel good about 48-49% which is similar to the range pointed out in December.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:42 pm</b>: Q: How are you thinking about the overall smartphone market demand, given where memory prices are headed, availability of components and how that might hurt demand destruction or market weakness? What are you seeing as we move through the year?<br/>
<br/>
A: On the supply side, the constraints that I mentioned is due to advanced node capacity and it's really a result of growing so well in Q1 with the 23% and having less flexibility partly due to that in the process to increase it as much as we would like to increase it. Beyond Q2, I don't really want to comment on supply. Supply is a function of a lot of things in the industry that move around a lot so I wouldn't want to comment on that, and I talked before on memory pricing. Hopefully that answers your question. In terms of smartphone demand, we believe that based on the information that we've got, we gained share in the December quarter. Obviously the market wasn't growing at 23% so we feel good about doing that but I wouldn't want to predict how the market reacts in the future. It's very difficult to do that.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:42 pm</b>: Q: Can you help us understand, you mentioned there's a range of options that you're looking at, how should we think about LTAs in the marketplace or is it more spot based particularly around memory? How should we think about the dynamics of the marketplace?<br/>
<br/>
A: It's a range, I don't want to get more specific than that. There are different levers that we can push and who knows how successful they'll be, but there's a range of options.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:44 pm</b>: Q: Grew services by 14% and you said the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; was a record for the December quarter, but third party data is showing a notable deceleration in &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; growth, maybe 7% in the quarter relative to your 14% growth. Cna you confirm that if it's correct and what might the drivers be?<br/>
<br/>
A: We had a quarterly record on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and we don't provide specific color on how the individual services categories have done. We saw broad-based growth across all the different categories, records in both developed and emerging markets and double digit growth in both of those too. We don't provide that detailed color at the services level.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:44 pm</b>: Q: Back to memory prices, I appreciate that you have a range of options to address that. Historically Apple has not used a pricing lever unless FX markets got very dislocated to ruin arbitrage or anything like that, but would pricing be a lever that you were willing to pull or push?<br/>
<br/>
A: I wouldn't want to speculate on that one.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:46 pm</b>: Q: Looking at your capital investment in Q1, it did moderate from the last one. Did the partnership with Google, does that have any near term impact on intent to use Apple Private Cloud? Any changes on that through the collaboration?<br/>
<br/>
A: We won't provide details on the arrangement and collaboration, speaking on capex in general, we have a hybrid model for capex, so what happens is our capex can be volatile independent of our business, made of several different line items including tooling, facilities, investments in retail or data centers, leveraging a combination of first- and third-party capacity so it's hard to read into the capex and draw any conclusions. There will be some ebbs and flows to capex and last year we did build out our private cloud compute environment and so we did have some spending related to that in December.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:48 pm</b>: Q: You mentioned product gross margin, what are you seeing with mix as a driver on &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; versus 16, as well as tariffs in the quarter and what you're expecting for next quarter?<br/>
<br/>
A: I mentioned overall margin, we have a higher favorability than you might have seen in other cycles. Typically we see the impact of the cost structure of new products, but we were seeing a more favorable offset from the mix and leverage versus historical because of the demand. We outlined an amount of &#36;1.4 billion in tariffs for December and we landed roughly in that range.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:49 pm</b>: Q: How do you differentiate between Apple foundation model functionality and third party models? Does the Apple model evolve to a different layer in the software stack? How do you think about it as you partner with third-party frontier models? <br/>
<br/>
A: You should think about it as a collaboration and we'll indepedently do our own stuff, but you should think about what is going to power the personalized version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; as a collaboration with Google.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:50 pm</b>: Q: Given the memory constraint on commodities, with Apple having more purchasing power, do you think this is a chance for you to increase your market share as competitors have more constraints in getting access to memory?<br/>
<br/>
A: I'd only want to talk about what has happened, and we believe that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; gained share in the quarter and that Mac gained share for the full year, so we feel very good about our position.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:51 pm</b>: Q: Some pundits are comparing the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; upgrade cycle to the 2020-2021 year, curious if you agree to that view and can you layer on the impact of &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; to the refresh rate?<br/>
<br/>
A: Each cycle has its own characteristics, I wouldn't compare it to a specific one. &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; is a unique product that brings several compelling features to one product and it has done extremely well and we feel quite good about it. We talked about the fact that we have a large and diverse installed base of customers and this product has really resonated with multiple cohorts whether you're on older devices or newer.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:52 pm</b>: Q: I'm surprised you guys are constrained on advanced packaging, as you generally get your share at a big foundry. How long will these supply impact your ability to ship to true demand?<br/>
<br/>
A: It's difficult to estimate demand when you haven't met the demand. We have internal estimates, but I don't want to share those. It's the advanced nodes, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> to be specific, where our SOCs are the latest SOCs that are produced as to what is gating the Q2 supply. It's a direct result of the 23% growth and that far outstripping what we had internally estimated and having more limited flexibility in the supply chain for some period of time. I don't want to estimate when supply and demand will balance at this point.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:54 pm</b>: Q: There's a lot of focus on the China demand, but you also called out India. Can you help unpack some of the things you're seeing in the Indian market?<br/>
<br/>
A: We set a quarterly revenue record during the December quarter, and to go a little further down, we set quarterly revenue records on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and an all-time revenue record on Services. We really like what we see there, and it's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the fourth-largest PC market. Despite some very nice growth history, we have modest share there and so we think there's a huge opportunity for us there. The majority of customers that are buying &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Watch are all new to that product. We are seeing strong double-digit growth in the install base in India as well which is really encouraging.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:56 pm</b>: Q: You clearly deepend some of your own internal silicon capabilities on the device, I'm curious if we should think about that as a lever or a supportive factor to gross margin that might be under appreciated?<br/>
<br/>
A: In terms of the product, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a> has been an incredible game changer for us, starting with &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Mac as of a few years ago. We believe this is a game changer and a major competitive advantage.<br/>
<br/>
We have been investing in core technologies like our own silicon, our own modem, and those do provide opportunities for cost savings and they also provide the differentiation. That gives us more control over the roadmap so there's a lot of strategic value to it but we also see those investments impacting gross margin in a positive way.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:57 pm</b>: Q: Thinking about how you manage AI, do you see it evolving more to edge or on-demand services versus cloud-based AI?
