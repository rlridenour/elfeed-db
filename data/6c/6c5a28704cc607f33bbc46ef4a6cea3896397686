<p>The philosophy professor heading up the office at his college that handles student violations of academic integrity, like cheating, is dealing with a seemingly stonewalling upper administration, and needs some help.<span id="more-53724"></span></p>

<p>Further, there&#8217;s some reason to think that political considerations are playing a role in the administration&#8217;s inaction.</p>
<p>The professor writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I’m in need of advice from the readers of Daily Nous!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I&#8217;m a philosopher who serves as an academic integrity officer at a public liberal arts college&#8212;and I have a problem. Several faculty members have reported to me that they’ve discovered two students who have been systematically cheating in their classes by generating their papers using AI, when this is expressly forbidden. (One of the students did this in several philosophy classes.) Some of these classes were from last semester, but our policies explicitly allow students to be charged for past infractions if new evidence comes up, as it did in these cases. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>So, no problem, right? The academic integrity cases get filed, and things take their usual course. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Except&#8230;. not this time. The administration is simply refusing to have these cases heard. They&#8217;re also simply refusing to say why they&#8217;re not having these cases heard. And, by the way, there is no possible doubt that the students are in violation. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I suspect that what’s happening here is that the administration is caving to parental and/or political pressure to give these students a free pass. The parents of one of the students contacted the Governor&#8217;s Office, who then sent at least one email to the administration on their behalf. I&#8217;m not privy to what might have happened here. But it looks like at least one of the students is getting a free pass on multiple counts of cheating because the administration is worried about parental/political response if they’re subjected to the usual academic integrity proceedings—proceedings that would likely preclude them from graduating this May. I suspect that the other student is benefiting from this. The cases are very similar, and so if one student gets a pass then the other one does also.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I’m loathe to just go along with this, toe the administration line, and ignore the students’ infractions. Students shouldn’t be getting college credit for philosophy classes that they didn’t earn.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>TL; DR: Two students have clearly cheated in several classes (including several philosophy classes) and the administration is refusing to have their cases heard. What to do? </em></p>
