Setting the Scene Transit is a seamless alternative to JSON (actually an extension of JSON). Why use Transit when JSON is so prevalent? For me, the simple reason was that it allows me to preserve my data types (mine are Clojure, but they are not necessarily such) over the wire. For me in particular this was my time types, and my uuids (which I wanted to standardize so they stop alternating between UUIDs, strings, and keywords, for matching purposes).
