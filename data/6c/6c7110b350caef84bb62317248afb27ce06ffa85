<p>In June 1936, when the University of Wisconsin bestowed an honorary doctorate of letters on actress Katharine Cornell, she received a telegram from Noël Coward:</p>
<p>DARLING DARLING DOCTOR KITTY,<br />
THOUGH QUITE REASONABLY PRETTY<br />
THOUGH UNDOUBTEDLY A STAR, DEAR<br />
PLEASE REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE, DEAR.<br />
WHY, IN LIEU OF ALL YOUR BETTERS,<br />
SHOULD YOU HAVE DISTINGUISHED LETTERS?<br />
THIS COMES FROM THE JEALOUS SOEL<br />
OF YOUR SOMEDAY DOCTOR NOËL.</p>
