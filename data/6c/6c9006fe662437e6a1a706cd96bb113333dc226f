Apple is "drastically" cutting production of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> and shifting focus toward the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/supply-chain/apple-slashes-iphone-air-production-plans-boosts-other-17-models-sources"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a> reports.<br/>

The business publication claims to have learned of a major cut to &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; production motivated by weaker-than-expected consumer interest, nearly to "end of production levels." Despite early reports of the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/17/iphone-air-sells-out-in-china/">selling out within hours of launch in China</a>, the overall reception has apparently been lukewarm in the region.<br/>
<br/>
Combined with weak demand in other markets, sales projections have dropped significantly. Although Nikkei declined to disclose the full extent of the production cut or which suppliers will be affected, it says that the changes may be seen in Apple's supply chain in the coming months. <br/>

A new KeyBanc Capital Markets survey for investors reveals "virtually no demand for &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;, and limited willingness to pay for a foldable." Demand for other &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models is said to be healthy but measured, with the mix "continuing to shift toward Pro and Pro Max models." Moreover, AI features have yet to meaningfully influence buying decisions.<br/>

Last week, Japan's Mizuho Securities said that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/17/iphone-air-production-to-be-cut-amid-lower-sales/">will reduce iPhone Air production</a> by one million units this year. Meanwhile, Apple apparently plans to increase production of &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models by two million units. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/17/samsung-reportedly-gives-up-on-thin-smartphones/">separate report</a> claimed that Samsung has canceled plans to release a successor to its own &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; rival, the Galaxy S25 Edge, due to low sales. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/">Nikkei</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/report-virtually-no-demand-for-iphone-air/">Report: &#039;Virtually No Demand&#039; for iPhone Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-virtually-no-demand-for-iphone-air.2469574/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
