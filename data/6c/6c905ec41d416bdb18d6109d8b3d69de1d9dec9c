The new version of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; that Apple released today appears to be limited to the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max, but the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> will have a launch day update too.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhones have &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; pre-installed, but they have &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; 23A330, and not the launch version of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; that came out on Monday. The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Air will need to be updated to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; version 23A341 tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max will need to be upgraded to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; version 23A345, which is the update that Apple just released.<br/>
<br/>
It's not clear what's in the new version of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; for the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max will start arriving to customers on Friday, September 19.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/18/ios-26-day-one-updates-required/">Day One iOS 26 Updates Required for All iPhone 17 Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/day-one-ios-26-updates-required-for-all-iphone-17-models.2466458/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
