On Monday, Marcin Borkowski (Mbork) <a href="https://mbork.pl/2025-08-18_Cutting_clips_from_videos_with_Emacs">published a post on extracting a video clip from within Emacs</a>. It seemed like a useful tool to have and I was going to write about it but Sacha mentioned it on <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/08/2025-08-18-emacs-news/">Emacs News</a> before I got a chance. Unless I have something pertinent to add to the discussion, I generally don&rsquo;t write about things that Sacha has already covered.

This time, Álvaro Ramírez came to my rescue by publishing <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-as-your-video-trimming-tool">his own take on the problem</a>. Ramírez says that he&rsquo;s been meaning to implement such a feature to his <a href="https://xenodium.com/seek-and-you-shall-find">Ready Play Mode</a> and that Mbork&rsquo;s post gave him the nudge that he needed to do it. His post has a nice animated GIF that shows the result in action. It&rsquo;s pretty impressive.

Ramírez says that the whole thing took about 300 lines of (Elisp) code and rather than adding it to his post, he provided a pointer to it in his repository because, as he says, he&rsquo;s probably going to be tweaking it so you might as well get the latest version.

If you&rsquo;re an Emacs user and sometimes want to extract a clip from a video, you should take a look at these two posts.</p>
