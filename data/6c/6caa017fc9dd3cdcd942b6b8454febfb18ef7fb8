<blockquote>
  <p>When Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) <a href="https://x.com/ErnestScribblr/status/1924835528173658492">asked</a> Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem for the definition of “habeas corpus,” Noem incorrectly described it as a right that the President of the United States has to deport people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can go the Latin route (“produce the body”) or the English <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/habeas-corpus">common-law route</a> (the accused have a right to be shown the evidence against them and defend themselves in court). Noem went the “biggest clown of the clown-car Trump 2.0 administration” route.</p>
