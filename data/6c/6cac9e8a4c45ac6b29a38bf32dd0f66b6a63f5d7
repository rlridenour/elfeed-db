Enter the beautiful self-documenting nature of Emacs. Put your cursor on the thing you want to change (remember, our whole philosophy emacs inherited from *Nix is that everything is text). Then do C-u C-x = (what-cursor-position) and you&rsquo;ll get a buffer telling you more than you wanted to know about the text you&rsquo;re on top of. For us, we just want to know the faces at hand; give them a search and then you&rsquo;ll know just which to change in customize-face.
