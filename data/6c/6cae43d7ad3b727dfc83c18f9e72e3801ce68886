 <p>
Nine people were shot in a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina, this week, and the evidence points to it being a racist hate-crime. So, 144 years and 1 day after his birth, we are reminded that some things, unfortunately have not changed.

 <blockquote>
 <p>
 <b>America</b>
</p>

 <p>
How would you have us, as we are? <br></br>
Or sinking ’neath the load we bear? <br></br>
Our eyes fixed forward on a star? <br></br>
Or gazing empty at despair?
</p>

 <p>
Rising or falling? Men or things? <br></br>
With dragging pace or footsteps fleet? <br></br>
Strong, willing sinews in your wings? <br></br>
Or tightening chains about your feet?
</p>
</blockquote>
