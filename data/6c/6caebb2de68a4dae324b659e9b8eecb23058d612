<p><a href="https://gisme.georgetown.edu/people/jason-brennan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Brennan</a> (Georgetown), who had been the editor-in-chief of PAQ, is stepping down from the position. Readers may recall he <a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/10/07/new-editorial-team-at-philosophy-public-affairs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently became editor-in-chief of <em>Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs</em></a>.</p>
<p>Professor Flanigan asked that the following message about PAQ be shared:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As always, Public Affairs Quarterly invites philosophical research on any topics related to ethics and public policy, including business ethics, PPE, the philosophy of race, bioethics, public health ethics, the philosophy of sex, egalitarianism, the philosophy of education, and political philosophy, more generally. We are especially interested in submissions that break new ground by addressing timely topics and creative essays that are accessible to non-specialist readers. We encourage early-career scholars to send their work to PAQ. We are focused on evaluating essays quickly and providing high-quality editorial feedback for all essays that are sent for review</em></p>
<p>The change in editor-in-chief is effective immediately.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/03/19/new-editor-at-public-affairs-quarterly/">New Editor at Public Affairs Quarterly</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
