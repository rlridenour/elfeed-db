Apple has supported the National Park Foundation with this annual charitable initiative since 2017.<br/>
<br/>
The non-profit organization "generates private support and builds strategic partnerships to protect and enhance America's national parks for present and future generations."<br/>
<br/>
Apple celebrates U.S. national parks every August with special content across services like the App Store, Apple Maps, Apple Fitness+, and Apple Podcasts. Apple Maps has a <a href="https://maps.apple.com/guides?curated=11864693040948696680">Discover America's National Parks guide</a> for hikes, Apple Fitness+ is offering a selection of Time to Run episodes inspired by national parks, and Apple Podcasts is featuring <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/yellowstone-national-park-celebrity-bears-and-a/id1455418690?i=1000686125761">"The Wild with Chris Morgan" episodes</a> that spotlight various national parks.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also promoted the National Park Service app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1696348740">as App of the Day</a> in the App Store.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, on August 24, Apple Watch users can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/19/national-parks-activity-challenge-2025/">unlock a special national parks award</a> in the Fitness app, and animated stickers for the Messages app, by recording a workout of 20 minutes or more with any app that adds workouts to the Health app. <br/>
<br/>
Apple CEO Tim Cook is a national parks enthusiast. In 2022, he <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/08/apple-celebrates-americas-parks/">said</a> the parks provide a "sense of awe, tranquility, and quiet reverence only nature can inspire," and he emphasized that they are "well worth protecting, today and for every generation to come."<br/>
<br/>
