Apple is aiming to keep <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ subscribers from canceling, offering a discounted subscription when customers threaten to stop paying.<br/>

If you cancel your &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ subscription, you may see a pop-up that drops the price of &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ to &#36;5.99 for the next two months, before the &#36;12.99 per month cost resumes. Apple appears to have started offering the discount <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tvPlus/comments/1my9s69/is_a_cancellation_offer_from_apple_new_599_for_2/">in the last few days</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/21/apple-tv-plus-price-increase-announced/">increased the price</a> of &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ to &#36;12.99 per month in the United States, so the offer for a temporarily discounted subscription may be aimed at those who are canceling their subscriptions due to the price hike.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is still charging &#36;99 for an annual subscription, so there is an option to get a lower price when subscribing for a full year. Apple also has not changed the price of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a> bundles.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who want to get the &#36;5.99 deal without continuing to pay &#36;12.99 should make sure to cancel after the second &#36;5.99 monthly charge. Opting in to the discounted offer today would mean the &#36;12.99 price would resume in November.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/25/apple-tv-plus-discount/">Apple Offers 54% Off Apple TV+ for Two Months to Stop Cancellations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-offers-54-off-apple-tv-for-two-months-to-stop-cancellations.2464037/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
