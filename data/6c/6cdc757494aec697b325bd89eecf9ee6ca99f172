<p>President Trump says the United States and India have reached a trade deal under which Washington will cut tariffs on Indian goods to about 18%, down from much higher recent levels that followed a period of trade friction between the two countries. Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed the announcement, saying it would apply to &quot;Made in India&quot; products and framing it as a boost for Indian exporters and the wider economy. In return, Trump claims India has agreed to reduce its own tariffs and non‑tariff barriers on US products to zero and to sharply increase purchases of American energy, technology, agricultural goods, coal and other items, though Indian officials have not yet publicly detailed those commitments. A central unresolved point is Trump’s assertion that India will halt imports of Russian oil, a claim that New Delhi has not confirmed and that analysts say remains one of several big unanswered questions about the still‑undocumented agreement.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Mh6OeOpkFfR9355afMrGwurrSHVOK1hY1wxV-LV_Qdr6Qn5Rk1BK00U9_HpS1eo79Kvuww6fvZbb0gwKhRP-GIpeluu3lPN53B83PVKeCE0qegiYiKQoHVPIYGZZQyPzPUa7oBEpxyQXbV8D7BitUOuDRFudlBY7aBdoIMmgSAmfoUss1daw7dHw6A3S0bh3I5yog-O7kNsIlLcuOxJ_bvS1Qfg' alt='Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India visited the White House ahead of the latest US‑India trade announcement.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Deal still informal: The trade package has been announced politically but will only be formalized once officials complete documentation for what Indian media describe as a bilateral trade agreement or BTA.</li><li>Scale of purchase pledge: Trump’s statement that India would buy $500 billion worth of US energy, technology, agriculture, coal and other products prompted Indian economists to note that such a sum would approach the size of India’s entire central government budget, fueling skepticism about how it would be implemented in practice.</li><li>Exporters’ optimism: Indian exporters and industry groups say the lower US tariff rate should make their products more competitive in the American market and could improve India’s position in Asian supply chains vis‑à‑vis China and Pakistan.</li><li>Energy trade shift: Several reports state that Washington has linked tariff relief to New Delhi curbing or stopping purchases of discounted Russian crude, with US officials suggesting India could instead boost imports from the United States and potentially Venezuela, though Modi has not publicly mentioned Russian oil in his comments so far.</li><li>Open strategic questions: Indian and US analysts note that the deal leaves unresolved broader issues such as a possible full free‑trade agreement, rules governing Indian investment in the US, the future of India’s access to Iran’s Chabahar port, and how any change in Russian oil buying might affect India’s energy security.</li></ul><blockquote>Prime Minister Modi and I are two people that GET THINGS DONE, something that cannot be said for most. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US administration: The White House and President Trump present the agreement as a breakthrough that will see India remove its tariffs and non‑tariff barriers, sharply expand purchases of US goods across energy, agriculture, coal and technology, and end its buying of Russian oil in exchange for Washington slashing duties on Indian exports.
