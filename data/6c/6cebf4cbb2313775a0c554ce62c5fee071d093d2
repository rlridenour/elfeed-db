<p>Armed attackers opened fire at an unlicensed bar operating inside a hostel in Saulsville, a township west of Pretoria in South Africa’s Gauteng province, early on Saturday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 13 others according to police and local officials. The dead include three children, with one victim reported as three years old, and those injured were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. Police say several gunmen entered the premises in the early hours, shot people inside, and then fled in a vehicle, prompting a large-scale manhunt for at least three suspects. Investigators are examining whether the violence may be linked to illegal alcohol sales at the bar and are appealing to the public for information as they work to identify the attackers and their motive.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/OUsUuz3secguGVfEC70wGG83Jswmn7mfo0_peX8NJHAS8DKxhGDNzUziB9BB7TNkrNhiSqctY-qeHm0gtuUDQbhe15XXV4pvzBcV2eeyXE8aIMuqNyYTzCNPu6fb76JWWqtPAZV6XvGDdlzBDOXqP4xHLrUpVVzalvQVppzI7g' alt='Police officers stand guard outside the hostel complex near Pretoria where a mass shooting occurred at an unlicensed bar.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Location details: The shooting happened in a hostel complex in Saulsville, west of Pretoria, within South Africa’s populous Gauteng province, an area that has seen previous incidents of violent crime.</li><li>Victim profiles: Police said the victims included both adults and minors who were socializing at or near the informal bar when the attackers entered and opened fire in the crowded space.</li><li>Police investigation: Authorities launched a manhunt involving detectives and crime scene specialists, who collected bullet casings and other forensic evidence while also reviewing whether the establishment’s unlicensed status contributed to security lapses.</li><li>Community response: Local residents gathered outside the hostel after the attack, expressing shock over the deaths and concern about ongoing safety issues linked to informal drinking venues in the township.</li><li>National crime context: The incident comes amid broader worries about gun violence in South Africa, where authorities have previously recorded frequent shootings in and around bars and taverns in several provinces.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>South African Police Service: Police said they are investigating the possibility that the killings were linked to illegal alcohol sales at the bar inside the hostel and have launched a search for multiple attackers who fled the scene.
