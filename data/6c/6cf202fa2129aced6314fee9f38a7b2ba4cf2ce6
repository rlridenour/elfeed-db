Apple devices that are running iOS 10 or macOS Sierra no longer meet the minimum system requirements for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, according to Apple's updated <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118308">iCloud support document</a>.<br/>

All &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; features now require iOS 11 or macOS High Sierra at minimum. &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; services like Keychain, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-photo-library/">iCloud Photos</a>, &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; backups, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-drive/">iCloud Drive</a> will no longer work on devices that are running iOS 10 or macOS Sierra.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 10 and macOS Sierra launched in September 2016, which means the updates are now nine years old. iOS 10 was the final version of iOS available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 5 (2012) and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5c (2013), along with the fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> (2012). These devices will no longer be able to access &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; services.<br/>

macOS High Sierra was compatible with all Macs running macOS Sierra, so there are no Macs that are losing &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; support with the compatibility change unless those Macs have not been updated to the last version of macOS they support.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/15/apple-drops-icloud-support-ios-10-macos-sierra/">Apple Drops iCloud Support for iOS 10 and macOS Sierra</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-drops-icloud-support-for-ios-10-and-macos-sierra.2465843/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
