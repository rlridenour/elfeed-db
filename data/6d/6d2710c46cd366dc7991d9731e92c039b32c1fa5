<p>Haiti’s Transitional Presidential Council says a majority has voted to remove acting Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, a move that adds to the country’s ongoing political instability. Council leaders Edgard Leblanc Fils and Leslie Voltaire said they still intend to proceed despite U.S. warnings that the move would bring consequences, underscoring a growing standoff with Washington. The council said it would identify a replacement within 30 days, even as it is due to dissolve in roughly two weeks, creating fresh uncertainty about near-term governance.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/LrZxLbv54zfc_RLS51p6vxpm2Rj-rWyIpTLAsOFGbj18m3f3UHXjHA0w99DDHn3a4iVReM8TuzMcPE359XugAq61SnqUYYGj7ZPr-iTWanGVTUkI8Ld1-S4zzASE-iSqxdkhsLR03vp5_zKt_Lr5nFIGVo5uHkMTh0zCidwhgA' alt='Image illustrating reporting on Haiti’s transitional council vote affecting the prime minister.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Replacement timeline: Council members said a new prime minister would be selected within 30 days, outlining a short runway for a leadership transition.</li><li>Council deadline: The vote comes shortly before the transitional council is supposed to step down, raising questions about how decisions will be carried forward during the handover.</li><li>U.S. warnings: U.S. officials warned there would be consequences if Haitian leaders pushed ahead with removing the prime minister, but two council figures said they would continue anyway.</li><li>US standoff: Al Jazeera reported the planned ouster has intensified a standoff with the United States, with the council framing the decision as part of its internal political process.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Transitional Presidential Council majority: A majority of the council says it voted to fire Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé and will move to select a replacement within 30 days.
