<p>The European Commission has outlined a plan to raise about €90 billion for Ukraine over the next two years by either borrowing jointly on markets or leveraging hundreds of billions in frozen Russian central bank reserves held in Europe. One option is an EU‑backed loan that would be serviced from the bloc’s budget, while another would create a “reparations loan” in which financial institutions like Belgium-based Euroclear transfer immobilised Russian funds into a vehicle for Kyiv and Ukraine would only repay once Russia pays war reparations. Supporters say the scheme is meant to keep Ukraine’s government and basic services running as Russia’s invasion drags on and US financial assistance winds down, helping to stabilise the country without immediately increasing burdens on European taxpayers. However, Belgium, which hosts most of the frozen assets, warns the reparations loan carries serious legal and financial risks and says its concerns have not yet been addressed, setting up tense talks among EU leaders later in December.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/nlIHedxXol5y7AeRcMlfjCjJbgDE_ni0R5qbTipJNLPVyq3P24cUx9QQkBRWGJocSqlBMepjcI4tao3LIqdKN96tq78gfZCbZ7bK5lExs8Mt1J_RbIbmBGPCNsci143PKL9WQUo_9-r4WJ1acRCSJapZe-FTywEG_drPKVMn9f_t' alt='European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and energy officials in Brussels as the EU outlines plans to keep supporting Ukraine.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of assets: Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear holds around €180 billion in Russian central bank funds, while other jurisdictions such as Japan, Switzerland, France and the United States are believed to hold additional tens of billions in immobilised Russian assets.</li><li>Decision thresholds: The joint EU borrowing option requires unanimous approval by all member states, whereas the reparations-loan mechanism needs only a qualified majority in the Council, making the latter procedurally easier to pass.</li><li>Belgium’s demands: Belgian officials insist that other EU members must share any financial fallout from using assets parked at Euroclear and have branded the reparations-loan approach the weakest of the available options.</li><li>Existing interest use: The EU has already started diverting interest income generated by the frozen Russian central bank assets toward Ukraine, but has so far stopped short of touching the principal balances themselves.</li><li>Link to US support: Brussels framed the new proposals as a way to maintain predictable budget support for Kyiv at a time when US financial assistance is winding down, highlighting Europe’s desire to avoid a funding gap for Ukraine’s government.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Commission: The Commission argues that using frozen Russian assets, directly or as collateral, is a legitimate way to help keep Ukraine solvent and to link future repayments to any eventual reparations paid by Moscow, rather than immediately increasing the contribution from European taxpayers.
