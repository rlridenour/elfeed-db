If you follow Charles Choi&rsquo;s work, you&rsquo;ll know that, unlike some of us, he&rsquo;s not afraid of menus and uses then frequently. His latest hack is to <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/customizing-the-emacs-help-menu.html">take a look at—and reimagine—the Emacs Help menu</a>. You can read his post for all the details but the thing I really like is popping up help in a new frame. The result is that you can keep the help around for as long as you need it without feeling the need to reclaim the screen real estate.

<p>
You can do that with buffers in a single frame, of course, but putting it in an separate frame makes it seem more disjoint from your working environment: it&rsquo;s right there if you need it but it&rsquo;s not cluttering up your working buffers.
</p>
<p>
Choi implements this with three new commands:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Open an Info buffer in a new frame</li>
<li>Open a new Info instance in a new frame</li>
<li>Open a Man page in a new frame</li>
</ol>
<p>
This seems particularly nice if you have enough screen real estate to keep the new frames visible. All the information is there to consult without disturbing your working buffers. It&rsquo;s a nice way of removing a bit of friction from your workflow.

We here at Irreal prefer not to use menus—although we have been known to under duress—but I really like the idea of invoking separate frames for help. Choi gives the code for his changes so it would probably be trivial to bind the functions to a key shortcut instead of—or in addition to—a menu. Take a look at Choi&rsquo;s post and see what you think.</p>
