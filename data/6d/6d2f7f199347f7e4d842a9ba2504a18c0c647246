If you&rsquo;ve been around Irreal for even a little while, you know I hate using the mouse. I don&rsquo;t like to use it anywhere but I particularly hate using it in Emacs. So I don&rsquo;t—mostly. I use WebKit to display my HTML emails and it&rsquo;s convenient to use the track pad (or the arrow keys) to scroll the email but mostly I never use the mouse while I&rsquo;m in Emacs. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s really east to get inadvertent mouse actions with a track pad because  your hands naturally lie on it when you&rsquo;re typing.

If you, too, hate having to deal with the mouse, James Cherti—whom I&rsquo;ve written about before [<a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12575">1</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12811">2</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12969">3</a>]—has a solution. His <a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/inhibit-mouse.el">inhibit-mouse package</a> effectively turns off the mouse when you&rsquo;re in Emacs and the mode is enabled. It seems like a nice package and may be just what you need.

<p>
As much as I hate the mouse—including the inadvertent clicks that take me to a different window in the middle of my work—I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want to turn it off. The times when I <i>do</i> want to use it, it&rsquo;s is to save work and having to stop and re-enable the mouse largely negates that.

Still, you may differ and, if so, this package could be just what you need to bring your runaway mouse under control. Cherti has a good write up about it in his README at the above link so take a look if you think you might be interested.</p>
