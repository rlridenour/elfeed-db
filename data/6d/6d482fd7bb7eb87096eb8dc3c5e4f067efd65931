<p>Nicaragua’s Interior Ministry said Saturday it released “dozens” of people from the national penitentiary system, after the United States publicly pressed Managua to free more than 60 political prisoners. The releases come amid heightened regional tensions, including U.S. actions against Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, a close ally of Nicaragua’s government, which opposition groups described as part of broader “political chess moves”. The announcement offers some immediate relief for families and detainees, while leaving open questions about who was freed and what comes next for those still held.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/-mBZcZNSyLt5_wJWv9pNIHrnmjv_UaTUfZYcmv98tkEit_miIa4sA3QXdpXhnJwQmBSztOk6JtiM5x3Dh5KoQSmKezSVUYUauMnwHvG8P2PApZt_qlhXOmvLTTboLZospV9gfRQawjn0C2bp0hbzzR8Ibz-RwtbXZ4ni5S7S_g' alt='Image accompanying ABC News report on Nicaragua’s announced prisoner releases.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Official framing: Nicaragua’s Interior Ministry presented the releases as a formal action by authorities within the national penitentiary system, without publicly detailing names or specific charges in the initial announcement.</li><li>US demand timing: The U.S. demand for the release of more than 60 political prisoners was reported a day before Nicaragua’s announcement, underscoring the rapid diplomatic pressure-and-response cycle.</li><li>Opposition view: Opposition groups argued the releases fit a strategic regional backdrop, describing them as part of “political chess moves” linked to Washington’s actions involving Venezuela.</li><li>Regional linkage: The releases were reported in the wake of U.S. forces seizing Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro, an event highlighted by multiple outlets as a factor shaping Managua’s calculations.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Nicaraguan government (Interior Ministry): Authorities said they freed dozens of prisoners from the national penitentiary system, announcing the measure publicly without extensive details on individuals.
