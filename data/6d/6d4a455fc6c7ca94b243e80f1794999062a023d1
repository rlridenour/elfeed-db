Casie Trotter sent me a link to a wonderful passage from Nietzsche’s 1882 book,  <i>The Gay Science</i>. This is aphorism 276, his resolution for that year:
</p>

 <blockquote>
 <p>
I want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them — thus I will be one of those who make things beautiful… I do not want to wage war against ugliness. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse the accusers… And all in all and on the whole: some day I want only to be a Yes-sayer!
</p>
</blockquote>

 <p>
I’m not sure what Nietzsche would think of his work prompting this week’s prayer, but here it is anyway:
</p>

 <p>
God of beauty and wonder,
</p>

 <p>
Let me be known <br></br>
not for what I found ugly, <br></br>
but for what I found beautiful.
</p>

 <p>
Not for what was harmed, <br></br>
but for what was healed.
</p>

 <p>
Not for what I tore down, <br></br>
but for what I built up.
</p>

 <p>
Not for what I despised, <br></br>
but for all that I loved.
</p>

 <p>
In the name of the one <br></br>
who sees the beauty in us all,
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
