<p>President Trump’s administration is assembling a US-led “Board of Peace” and a subordinate “Gaza Executive Board” intended to help oversee post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza as the ceasefire moves forward. Israel’s government has publicly objected, saying the announced lineup was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to Israeli policy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed Israel’s foreign minister to raise the issue with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Invitations have gone to a mix of regional and international figures, and several outlets report the board’s charter language suggests ambitions beyond Gaza, potentially positioning the body to take on broader conflict-mediation roles. Separately, multiple reports say a draft charter includes membership terms that would allow countries contributing $1 billion in cash funds to extend participation beyond an initial time limit, a point some coverage notes the White House disputes or calls misleading.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JX_hB-JBOe-Bx6CaZW0SbrNzauvDIx4ieod9uV1DNHEl9pJ9ByQDwhw8aRnJeV4qAgCByFnTty_gFS5bLbM3seBq6YJUo6rw3CF7ru-hTlK1nu2rGDcMtnTlTvf1JhCltXkrOlRpv5sr4NHwJ16qXGJoqZjpExopTeKygwVgGigNqGzTPuMY4ze8D-2_xWn8m-7rHA' alt='A camp for displaced Palestinians, in Gaza City, on Tuesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Named participants: Lists and reports on invitees and appointees include Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, Argentinian President Javier Milei, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, and references to Canadian involvement, with the White House indicating additional names may follow.</li><li>Advisory lineup: The Gaza Executive Board described in reports includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi among other regional and international officials, framed as an advisory body under the wider board.</li><li>Decision mechanics: A draft charter described by Bloomberg-cited reporting says member states would each have one vote on decisions taken by majority, but outcomes would remain subject to the chairman’s approval, with President Trump as inaugural chairman.</li><li>UN overlap: Coverage highlights concerns among critics that the board’s broad mandate could create an alternative arena for diplomacy that overlaps with, or rivals, the United Nations—an institution President Trump has long criticized.</li><li>Defined focus areas: The White House has described the board’s focus as including topics such as “regional relations” and “investment attraction,” alongside Gaza-related planning.</li></ul><blockquote>The announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli government: Israel says the announced Gaza Executive Board lineup was not coordinated with Israel and contradicts Israeli policy; Netanyahu instructed Israel’s foreign minister to contact US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
