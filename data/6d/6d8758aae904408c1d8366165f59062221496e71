The carrier said affected customers can accept the credit by logging into the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-verizon/id416023011">My Verizon app</a>, but it might take some time before this option shows up in the app. Affected customers will receive a text message when the credit is available.<br/>
<br/>
On average, Verizon says the &#36;20 credit covers multiple days of service.<br/>
<br/>
"This credit isn't meant to make up for what happened," it said. "But it's a way of acknowledging your time and showing that this matters to us."<br/>
<br/>
Verizon once again apologized for the outage.<br/>
<br/>
"We are sorry for what you experienced and will continue to work hard day and night to provide the outstanding network and service that you expect from Verizon," it said.<br/>

Verizon said that customers who are still experiencing issues should restart their device, as a quick way of reconnecting to the network following the outage.<br/>
<br/>
The outage began mid-day on Wednesday, and Verizon was finally able to fully resolve it around 10 p.m. Eastern Time. The downtime affected the ability to make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and use mobile data.<br/>
