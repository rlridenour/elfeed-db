<p>Afghanistan’s Taliban administration says Pakistani aircraft carried out overnight strikes on several eastern provinces, destroying a home in Khost province and killing nine children and a woman inside, along with injuring additional civilians in Kunar and Paktika. The reported attack came just hours after a suicide bombing on Pakistan’s Federal Constabulary headquarters in Peshawar killed three security personnel and wounded at least 11, an assault Pakistani authorities blame on militants operating from Afghan territory. Islamabad has not issued an official statement on the strikes, but has for months accused the Afghan Taliban of failing to curb Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other armed groups that it says use Afghan soil to launch attacks. Kabul rejects these allegations and has warned that it will “respond at the right time,” raising fears that already tense relations between the neighbours could deteriorate further even as some regional mediators encourage dialogue.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/MpCNSvupMhbIIYf6ZSX3V-l_funyxgoL6MRGqXXMqlxLUv4tOzGb1yCCif8rCaGhLn45Xjn0ECMXAkXhNgvCkbk1UrAUC3yaVf5-_NgQywKS' alt='Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, who accused Pakistan of conducting deadly airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Strikes across provinces: Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the bombing hit a specific family home in Khost’s Gurbuz district and that separate Pakistani strikes also took place in Kunar and Paktika, where four civilians were reported injured.</li><li>Victims identified: Afghan officials named the house’s owner as Waliat Khan, son of Qazi Mir, and stated that his residence was destroyed in the blast.</li><li>Link to Peshawar attack: The air operations occurred a day after a suicide bomber targeted Pakistan’s Federal Constabulary headquarters in Peshawar, with Pakistani authorities attributing the assault to militants who they say crossed from Afghanistan.</li><li>Stalled peace talks: Earlier rounds of Pakistan–Afghanistan talks hosted by Türkiye and Qatar in Istanbul ended without a workable mechanism to manage cross‑border militancy, and Pakistan’s defence minister later described the dialogue as having entered an “indefinite” phase.</li><li>Ceasefire under strain: The Taliban noted that the strikes come after both sides had recently agreed a ceasefire arrangement following deadly clashes along the border in October, signalling a setback for efforts to de‑escalate.</li></ul><blockquote>Afghanistan will respond at the right time - Zabihullah Mujahid, Taliban government spokesman</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Taliban administration (Afghanistan): The Taliban say Pakistani “invading forces” bombed a civilian house in Khost at around midnight, killing children and a woman and violating Afghan sovereignty, and they warn that they will choose the timing and manner of any response..
