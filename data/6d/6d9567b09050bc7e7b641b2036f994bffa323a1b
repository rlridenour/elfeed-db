         
         <p>Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
note-taking and file-naming tool for Emacs.</p>

<p>Denote is based on the idea that files should follow a predictable and
descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear
indication of what the contents are about, without reference to any
other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation of such
files or file names while providing facilities to link between them
(where those files are editable).</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a constistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Version 4.1.0 on 2025-10-17</h2>

<p>The overarching theme of version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4.1.0</code> is that of continuing to
deliver on the highly hackable/flexible/powerful potential of Denote.
All the core functionality is the same as before and you still only
need a tiny configuration to use Denote productively. We are adding
more refinements and subtle improvements under the hood, while making
it even easier for advanced users/developers to piece together a
workflow that matches their particular needs.</p>

<p>Since version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4.0.0</code>, we have moved the “Denote extras” files into
their own packages. I cover their changes further down after I
elaborate on all the changes to the core Denote package:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#h:ce5befb1-0401-4b06-ad4f-64c567b15b91"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal</code> version 0.2.0</a></li>
  <li><a href="#h:1403c3b9-280d-4033-a930-5364bf7b5e90"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org</code> version 0.2.0</a></li>
  <li><a href="#h:d2e18b7d-dc8d-48ad-a0d7-71f291d5aa7c"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code> version 0.2.0</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I write all the release notes by hand. The reason is that I
consider this process an essential part of my role as a maintainer.
Taking the time to review and document everything ensures that (i) I am
well informed about the state of the package, (ii) I did not forget
anything about this development cycle, and (iii) I take another look
at the changes we made to ensure everything is in order.</p>

<h3>Overview of the new features for core Denote</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code> can be assigned to a list of
directories. The original string value is also acceptable and
remains the default.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Advanced users can define a completely custom scheme for
identifiers. This can be as simple as automatically assigned ordinal
numbers to increasingly complex patterns that may also involve user
input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-find-backlink-with-location</code> is like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-find-backlink</code> except it also moves to the exact location of
the link in the corresponding file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All Denote buffer names share a common prefix, which is subject to
the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-buffer-name-prefix</code>. This makes it easier to
spot them in the buffer list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired</code> (alias <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-dired</code>) can sort
files by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">last-modified</code> in addition to the methods
that involve Denote file name components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-sorting</code> controls how files in all
query buffers are sorted by default. This covers backlinks, query
links for file contents, and any buffer produced by the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-grep</code> command. It benefits from the internal “Denote sort”
mechanism, which is also used by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired</code> and the Org dynamic
blocks of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org</code> package.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that the release notes are true only at the time of
publication. The single source of truth always is the official manual.</p>

<p><a id="h:60ed9223-a092-4d2a-a6b6-3ba72150648b"></a></p>

<h3>Set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code> to a list of directories</h3>

<p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code> can optionally be bound to a list
of file system paths, each of which represents a directory root, such
as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'("/home/prot/Documents/work/" "=/home/prot/Git/hut/")</code> (Denote
has always supported subdirectories, even for a singular <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code>).</p>

<p>When creating new files, such as with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> command, the first
directory on the list will be selected. This can be changed by
modifying the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-prompts</code> user option so that it asks for a
directory or subdirectory thereof. Or by writing small wrapper
commands that put files in a predefined directory, like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(defun my-denote-for-work ()
  "Like `denote' but always use the ~/Documents/work/ directory."
  (interactive)
  (let ((denote-use-directory "~/Documents/work/"))
    (call-interactively 'denote)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why have many directories as part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code>? Some
users want to maintain separate directories with Denote files, while
retaining the option of establishing links between (unlike the concept
of “silos” we support, where the directories are self-contained).
Those two directories can be their own Git repositories, for example,
and have different syncing policies for access across multiple
devices.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for providing the core
functionality in pull request 609: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/609">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/609</a>.</p>

<p>Jean-Philippe is a long-time contributor who has assigned copyright to
the Free Software Foundation. I made several changes on top, such as
to allow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired</code> (alias <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-dired</code>) to work with many
directories, by finding their common root (which would ultimately be
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>).</p>

<h3>Define completely custom Denote identifiers</h3>

<p>The default Denote identifier should work for most people in most
cases. I have considered the Denote file-naming scheme carefully and
know it is reliable. Advanced users who have a clear use-case of
something out-of-the-ordinary can now get “Denoted” file names with
arbitrary identifiers. Since this is an advanced feature, I will not
elaborate here on the technicalities. Though I have taken the time to
write at length in the manual about it, with concrete examples ranging
from simple to more complex scenaria. Start with this introduction:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:3048f558-7d84-45d6-9ef2-53055483e801">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote#h:3048f558-7d84-45d6-9ef2-53055483e801</a>.</p>

<p>This feature has been discussed and requested for a long time, across
several related issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/278">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/278</a>.</li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/581">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/581</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks, in no particular order, to mentalisttraceur, juh2, Christian
Tietze, and Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for sharing their thoughts. Also
thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for contributing the patches that
made this possible, the last of which is in pull request 586:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/586">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/586</a>.</p>

<h3>Find a backlink at its exact location in the file</h3>

<p>Denote has two ways of working with backlinks: (i) to display them in
a dedicated buffer and (ii) to use a minibuffer prompt that supports
completion in order to pick one file out of the list. The new command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-find-backlink-with-location</code> is of the latter kind. Like its
more generic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-find-backlink</code> counterpart, it uses the
minibuffer to pick a file that links to the current one. Then, it also
moves the cursor to where the link is.</p>

<p>I did this is in response to issue 471 as reported by johkneisl:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/471">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/471</a>.</p>

<h3>Denote buffer names use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-buffer-name-prefix</code></h3>

<p>This is a new user option that takes an arbitrary string. Its value is
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"[D]"</code> by default. It consolidates how we name all of our buffers.
Out-of-the-box, this applies to special buffers, like those produced
by the commands <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-backlinks</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired</code>. When the
optional minor mode <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-buffer-mode</code> is enabled, all
buffers whose file naming scheme is that of Denote will get the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-buffer-name-prefix</code> in addition to their own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-buffer-format</code>.</p>

<p>This is related to pull request 597 by James Kalyan:

<h3>The Denote sort mechanism can sort by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">last-modified</code></h3>

<p>In core Denote, this is used internally by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired</code> command
(alias <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-dired</code>) and the query buffers (more in the next
section). By default, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired</code> prompts for the sort method and
whether to reverse the order. Though there are user options to tweak
its behaviour (consult the manual). The Org dynamic blocks of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org</code> package also rely on this mechanism (<a href="#h:1403c3b9-280d-4033-a930-5364bf7b5e90"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org</code> version 0.2.0</a>).</p>

<h3>Control the default sort of files in query buffers</h3>

<p>Query buffers are those of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-backlinks</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-grep</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-contents-link</code> (in the latter case, the query buffer is
produced when you click on the link). Users can now modify how they
sort matching files via the option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-sorting</code>. The sorting
methods are by any of the Denote file names components (per
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-components</code>), random order, last modified, or an
arbitrary function.</p>

<p>Thanks to Lucas Quintana for the contribution in pull request 594:

<h3>Miscellaneous for core Denote</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired</code> command (alias <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-dired</code>) sets up its
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">revert-buffer-function</code> in a more robust way, such that it does not
affect the window layout under certain conditions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug with the menu entry of Denote that broke
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">context-menu-mode</code>. It addresses issue 592, as reported by artelse:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/592">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/592</a>. Thanks to Lucas
Quintana for the patch. Lucas has assigned copyright to the Free
Software Foundation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Thanks to ryota for refining the documentation of the variable
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-use-template</code> and its potential interference with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-capture-identifiers</code> in custom user code. We discussed
this in issue 545 and the patch was sent as pull request 598:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/545">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/545</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/598">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/598</a>. The change is
small, meaning that ryota does not need to assign copyright to
the Free Software Foundation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An internal check to determine if a file has backlinks is now faster
than before: it exits with a non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> value as soon as it finds one
match, instead of trying to collect all the backlinks. Thanks to
Yann Dutrieux for addressing an omission of mine in the original
implementation and then for discussing with me some further
refinements. Yann’s contribution was sent as pull request 637:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/637">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/637</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Thanks to Alan Schmitt and Ashish Panigrahi for fixing a couple of
typos, in pull requests 623 and 626, respectively:

<h3>Changes to the extensions of Denote I maintain</h3>

<p>This concerns all the former “Denote extras” that were shipped with
core Denote as well as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote</code>.</p>

<h4><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote</code> version 0.4.0</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The commands <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote-grep</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote-find</code> also
work when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code> is set to a list value, as explained
further above (<a href="#h:60ed9223-a092-4d2a-a6b6-3ba72150648b">Set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code> to a list of directories</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a Consult-powered counterpart to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-file-prompt</code>. It is for users of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code> package and comes into effect when the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote-mode</code> is enabled (that mode “Consults” all relevant
minibuffer prompts Denote uses so they get the familiar preview
functionality). The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-file-prompt</code> is used by
commands such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-find</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-link</code>, among others (<a href="#h:d2e18b7d-dc8d-48ad-a0d7-71f291d5aa7c"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code> version 0.2.0</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote-find</code> sorts its files by default. We
discussed this with Gianluca Della Vedova and Gianluca implemented
the tweak in pull request 18:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/consult-denote/pull/18">https://github.com/protesilaos/consult-denote/pull/18</a>. The change
is small, meaning that Gianluca does not need to assign copyright to

<h4><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal</code> version 0.2.0</h4>

<ul>
  <li>It is now possible to specify the desired interval used by the
command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-new-or-existing-entry</code> to determine what
“new” and “existing” mean. Users may want to, for example, maintain
one file per month, with daily entries as headings or as free-form
text. The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-interval</code> specifies the
interval as a symbol among <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">daily</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weekly</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">monthly</code>, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yearly</code>. Thanks to Ning Xu for floating the idea of non-daily
journaling in issue 18: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/issues/18">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/issues/18</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Thanks to Alan Schmitt for catching a couple of errors in my
original implementation and for suggesting fixes in pull requests
20 and 21. Also thanks to Abdelhak Bougouffa for addressing
another problem in pull request 23. Further changes by me.
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/20">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/20</a>.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/21">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/21</a>.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/23">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/23</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-signature</code> specifies a signature
that will be applied to all new journal entries. It is the
counterpart of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-keyword</code>. Possible values are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>,
for no predefined signature, a string for a constant signature, and a
function that returns a string which is then used as-is. Thanks to
Halogen3576 for suggesting an option for a signature in issue 13:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/issues/13">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/issues/13</a>.</p>

    <p>In the case of a function value, users may wish to integrate the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal</code> package with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code> package
(<a href="#h:d2e18b7d-dc8d-48ad-a0d7-71f291d5aa7c"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code> version 0.2.0</a>). For example, each new journal
entry should be defined as a new parent sequence. Thus:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(setq denote-journal-signature
      (lambda ()
        (denote-sequence-get-new 'parent)))
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-keyword</code> is extended to support a
function value which should return a string or list of strings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The integration with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x calendar</code> (when the minor mode
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-calendar-mode</code> is enabled) is more robust when
highlighting dates that have a Denote journal entry. Thanks to Alan
Schmitt for the patch that improves the check for visible dates
only. This was done in pull request 12: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/12">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/12</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-calendar</code> face is extended to also work when
Emacs is ran in a TTY. Thanks to Ettore Berardi for the original
contribution and for discussing this with me. It was done in pull
request 14: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/14">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/14</a>.
The contribution is less than 15 lines of code, meaning that Ettore
does not need to assign copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-path-to-new-or-existing-entry</code> is
tweaked to not kill the buffer of the new file it might generate.
Thanks to jbwfu for the change in pull request 17:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/17">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/17</a>. The change
is small, meaning that the author does not need to assign copyright
to the Free Software Foundation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dates with a single digit in the title of a new journal entry no
longer have a space where the second digit normally is. So something
like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">October 1</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">October  1</code>. Thanks to Josh Kingsley for
the patch. The change is small, meaning that Josh does not need to
assign copyright to the Free Software Foundation. It was done in
pull request 24: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/24">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-journal/pull/24</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thanks to gk2803 for renaming a couple of old symbols to their

package (<a href="#h:d2e18b7d-dc8d-48ad-a0d7-71f291d5aa7c"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code> version 0.2.0</a>). The block is called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code> and can be inserted at point with the command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-dblock-insert-sequence</code>. What this block does is list
the descendants of a given sequence up to a maximum depth. The
presentation is a typographic list of lists to visualise the
hierarchy of the complete sequence, with each set of children nested
under its parent. Thanks to Peter Prevos for the original
implementation in pull request 9 and for subsequent tweaks in pull
request 13. Other changes by me are done to ensure tighter
integration with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code> package.

    <p>All Org dynamic blocks that have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:sort-by-component</code> parameter
can now sort by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">last-modified</code>. This is made possible
by the aforementioned improvements to the core Denote sort mechanism
(<a href="#h:f6ea4714-1ed4-4db7-ad4b-c040b6c60c6d">The Denote sort mechanism can sort by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">random</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">last-modified</code></a>).</p>

    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-missing-links</code> Org dynamic block, which can be inserted
at point with the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-dblock-insert-missing-links</code>
takes an optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:not-regexp</code> parameter. This is a regular
expression of files to omit from the results. Same for the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-backlinks</code> block, which can be inserted at point with the
command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-dblock-insert-backlinks</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-files-as-headings</code> Org dynamic block, which can be
inserted at point with the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-dblock-insert-files-as-headings</code>
now also accepts an optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:exclude-tags</code> parameter. It is either
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> or non-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> and determines whether the heading will have the
file’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#+filetags</code> as its own tags. Thanks to Matt Nolan for
suggesting this idea in issue 14: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-org/issues/14">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-org/issues/14</a>.</p>

<h4><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code> version 0.2.0</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The new commands <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-find-next-sibling</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-find-previous-sibling</code> move to the next or previous
sibling in the given sequence. When called interactively, they work
relative to the current file. When called from Lisp, they expect a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SEQUENCE</code> argument and its corresponding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RELATIVES</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-dired</code> command is updated to (i) work with a
list value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code> (<a href="#h:60ed9223-a092-4d2a-a6b6-3ba72150648b">Set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code> to a list of directories</a>),
as noted further above and (ii) benefit from the refinements done to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired</code> with regard to its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">revert-buffer-function</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-rename-as-parent</code> makes it easier
to apply the Denote file-naming scheme to an existing file and make
it a new parent sequence. Thanks to Alex Carney for requesting
something along those lines in issue 4:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-sequence/issues/4">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-sequence/issues/4</a>.</p>

    <p>[ Remember that Denote is highly adaptable/hackable, meaning that
  many of these convenience commands build on top of the core with small
  extensions to it. The body of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-rename-as-parent</code> is
  only 4 lines long, two of which are for an error check. This is
  typical of much of what we provide and is how users can always
  extend Denote to do something slightly different than what we
  support out-of-the-box. ]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Made several other refinements under the hood, including the
addition of more tests. In this regard, thanks to Rory Molinari,
Peter Prevos, and Ashton Wiersdorf for fixing three bugs in pull
requests 5, 8, and 11, respectively:</p>
