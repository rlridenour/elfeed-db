<p>Sam Roberts, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>David Lerner, a high school dropout and self-taught computer geek
whose funky foothold in New York’s Flatiron district, Tekserve,
was for decades a beloved discount mecca for Apple customers
desperate to retrieve lost data and repair frozen hard drives,
died on Nov. 12 at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 72. [...]</p>

<p>Tekserve specialized in finding the cures for sick computers — including insect infestations — and recovering first novels and
other priceless data, which the company said it was able to do
about 85 percent of the time.</p>

<p>“We only charged for success,” Mr. Lerner said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were many great independent Apple resellers from the pre-Apple-Store era. There was only one that was legendary: Tekserve.</p>
