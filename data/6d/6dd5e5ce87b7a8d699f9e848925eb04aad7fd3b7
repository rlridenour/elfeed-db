<p>Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer is under intense political pressure after newly released U.S. Justice Department documents described ties between Peter Mandelson — Starmer’s pick as UK ambassador to the United States — and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Starmer said he did not know the “depth and darkness” of Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein and apologized directly to Epstein’s victims for making the appointment. Mandelson has since quit the House of Lords and is described in multiple reports as no longer serving as ambassador, while UK police have opened an investigation linked to the new disclosures. The fallout has shaken Starmer’s standing inside the governing Labour Party. Reports describe growing resentment among MPs and renewed discussion of what it would take to mount a leadership challenge. The wider “Epstein files” release is also rippling far beyond the UK, triggering investigations, resignations, internal reviews, and public apologies across Europe’s political and business elites. The disclosures have also renewed scrutiny of how Epstein cultivated relationships across politics, business, and culture — and how institutions respond when those ties come to light.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/QTfB5SZ1GEQHrqWhcMgZtwb3aEUYVpig0DHAQkyhAiIl_SrNB4akAJxAkltchR_S1plYh2qZRV65NVVWeJRonUpg8ZGJShYdgAp4F8FbSuekaLxkUV4wlv6JVXpCsMklL9GohY8c2strLCkuFXyQGcSBJZfo-JQm0Ih_RuCnZjGHrH2G9S4rDsJx3UWvVBUK0RogfcPYC9rRieRUUuafEuugsoJkMW4SKeWfSg' alt='Prime Minister Keir Starmer has vowed accountability and apologized to Epstein’s victims.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Labour infighting: Downing Street resisted calls to remove Starmer’s senior aide Morgan McSweeney over the Mandelson appointment, as some Labour backbenchers warned the aide’s survival could make Starmer’s position “untenable”.</li><li>Market jitters: As the crisis grew, the pound fell nearly 1% against the dollar in a single session, according to Semafor’s summary of market reaction.</li><li>Elite influence: An FT analysis likened Epstein’s operation to a “social Ponzi scheme,” using favors and introductions to embed himself among the wealthy and powerful.</li><li>Corporate fallout: Brad Karp stepped down as chair of U.S. law firm Paul Weiss after emails showed his interactions with Epstein long after Epstein’s sex-offense conviction.</li><li>US diplomacy gap: Mandelson’s Washington posting was touted as a way to manage relations with Donald Trump, so his swift downfall is a blow to Starmer’s approach to the US relationship.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Keir Starmer (UK prime minister): Starmer said Mandelson had lied about how well he knew Epstein and promised accountability, pairing that with an apology to Epstein survivors for his decision to appoint Mandelson.
