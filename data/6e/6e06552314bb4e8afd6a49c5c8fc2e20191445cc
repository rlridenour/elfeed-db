Further details have emerged about the camera system on Apple's upcoming foldable iPhone, informally dubbed the "iPhone Fold."<br/>

Expected to launch next year, Apple's book-style foldable is rumored to feature a 7.8-inch crease-free internal display and a 5.5-inch external screen. According to industry analyst <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the device will include a dual-lens rear camera along with front-facing cameras usable in both folded and unfolded states, ensuring comprehensive camera functionality in any configuration.<br/>
<br/>
While previous reports noted that the unfolded state will utilize an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/">under-screen camera (USC)</a>, there was less information about the front camera in the folded state – until now.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223835009454&navType=by">Korean news aggregator yeux1122</a>, citing an unknown Weibo-based source, Apple has opted for a hole-punch front-facing camera on the outer display. The design is said to be "almost identical to current foldables" on the market, such as Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold (pictured below). The blog also cited previously revealed information on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">display sizes</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/">screen resolutions</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It remains unclear whether the hole-punch will be visible during active use or encased in a smaller Dynamic Island, but Face ID is not expected to be part of the equation. Instead, Apple is believed to have <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">integrated Touch ID into the side button</a>, in order to conserve internal space for other components.<br/>

Kuo says final hardware specifications will be locked in during the second quarter of this year (April 1 - June 30), suggesting some elements are still subject to change. However, analyst Jeff Pu claims the device has already entered the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/">New Product Introduction (NPI) phase</a> at Foxconn – a critical stage in Apple's product development cycle – indicating that key specs may already be finalized.<br/>

Mass production is reportedly scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2026, with a release expected late next year. The first-generation foldable iPhone is expected to carry a price tag between <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/">&#36;2,000</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/foldable-iphone-to-cost-1000-more-than-pro-max/">&#36;2,300</a>. A second-generation model is reportedly already in the pipeline, with mass production planned for the second half of 2027.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/iphone-fold-camera-setup-outer-display/">iPhone Fold: New Leak Corroborates Camera Setup on Outer Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-fold-new-leak-corroborates-camera-setup-on-outer-display.2455408/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
