<p>In the latest escalation along the Israel-Lebanon front, Israel says it killed Hezbollah’s military chief of staff, Haytham Ali Tabatabai, in an airstrike on an apartment building in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Sunday, marking the first attack on the capital in several months despite a year‑long, US‑brokered ceasefire. Lebanon’s health ministry reported that five people were killed and 28 injured in the strike on the Haret Hreik district, a densely populated Hezbollah stronghold. Israeli officials described Tabatabai as a veteran figure who oversaw Hezbollah operations and rearmament efforts across the region and had been wanted by both Israel and the United States for years. Hezbollah confirmed that a senior commander was targeted, called the strike a “red line” and “ceasefire violation,” and said its leadership is weighing how to respond, raising fears that the fragile truce and broader regional calm could unravel.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/1Mpzr4qEOmP-QdHg-i6yQTEdYSOA43ReCH8mG96zjAZXB4q5_tMghnuX-mz1NYD7PfNw5lyi2Jks3U0Ro8NJnaq2ytQ8FR5cjAd7t09EcdcmhLb6aWTrl5q7gC9rijXye7HP_V0tNidE_p7YhjtcRKdYj6CJ1fWt_tv3uRoNYGkcS3NSp9RKpX5-nX23xr2Z5l1095Uy-hA5YA' alt='Lebanese civil defense workers inspect damage at a residential building in Beirut’s southern suburbs after an Israeli airstrike.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ceasefire under strain: The raid is at least the fifth Israeli strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs since a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah took effect in November 2024, underscoring how the truce has been repeatedly tested by cross‑border attacks.</li><li>Civilian area hit: The explosion tore through the third and fourth floors of a nine‑storey residential building in the Haret Hreik neighborhood, prompting ambulance and fire crews to search the damaged structure for victims.</li><li>Netanyahu’s rationale: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu framed the operation as part of a broader effort to dismantle Hezbollah’s military capacity and argued that removing Tabatabai would help secure what he described as a safer future for people in the region.</li><li>US role and criticism: Hezbollah officials accused Israel of acting with a “green light” from the United States, even as the strike came after a truce that Washington helped broker between Israel and the Iran‑backed group in late 2024.</li><li>Upcoming papal visit: The attack occurred about a week before Pope Leo XIV is scheduled to visit Lebanon, increasing concern that renewed tensions could overshadow or complicate preparations for the high‑profile trip.</li></ul><blockquote>The targeting was clearly aimed at a key... figure in the resistance, and the results are unknown - Mahmud Qomati</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli government: Israeli leaders present the strike as a justified move to eliminate a senior Hezbollah military figure they say was central to the group’s rearmament and operations across the region.
