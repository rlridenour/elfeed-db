<p>On March 13th, the Trump administration sent Columbia University a list of demands it must meet as a precondition for restoring $400 million in grant funding to the university that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/07/nyregion/trump-administration-columbia-grants-cancelled-antisemitism.html?searchResultPosition=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the administration had cancelled</a>. Last Friday, Columbia University said it would meet those demands.<span id="more-53155"></span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/14/nyregion/columbia-letter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&#8217;s the administration&#8217;s letter</a> and <a href="https://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/03.21.2025%20Columbia%20-%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here is Columbia&#8217;s response</a>.</p>
<p>Columbia&#8217;s response has been interpreted by many as an utter failure to defend academic freedom, and one that sets a dangerous precedent for the administration&#8217;s dealings with other universities. The Trump administration&#8217;s extortionary tactics with Columbia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/nyregion/columbia-trump-administration-funding-fight.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were</a> <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/trumps-columbia-funding-cutoff-is-illegal?sra=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal</a>, and Columbia University should have gone to the courts to defend themselves, not roll over. They are certainly wealthy enough a university to do so, and their failure here is disappointing.</p>
<p>There may be some disagreement over the damage to academic freedom, though. Two questions relevant to that assessment are: (a) to what extent did the Trump administration&#8217;s funding threat and demand letter affect decisions at Columbia University? (b) how extensive is Columbia&#8217;s capitulation?</p>
<p>On the first question, the letter from Columbia notes that &#8220;all of these steps have been underway,&#8221; meant as an assurance both to those worried about the University&#8217;s autonomy and to those interested in its commitment to compliance with the Trump administration&#8217;s demands. The letter leaves unanswered, &#8220;since when?&#8221; Presumably some of these steps have been underway longer than others, with some initiated well before the administration&#8217;s specific threat to its funding, and others added just last week.</p>
<p>The answer to that first question&#8212;which decisions were influenced by the government&#8217;s threats?&#8212;is part of the answer to the second. But we can also look at what Columbia&#8217;s proposed changes actually do. Looking them over, most of them leave lots of wiggle room to essentially end up doing very little. Even one of the more egregious-sounding concessions, such as the appointment of a new senior vice provost who will review Middle East and other area studies programs, is sure to say that the office will be &#8220;following academic procedures&#8221; when it makes recommendations about &#8220;any necessary changes, academic restructuring, or investments that will ensure academic excellence and complementarity across all programs in the given academic areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it may be that Columbia is trying to have its funding and its freedom, too, banking on its letter being conciliatory-enough looking for Trump to declare a win to his constituents while being vague enough to assure academics that the university is retaining its autonomy.</p>
<p>One problem with this strategy is that it legitimates government overreach into university operations and incursions on academic freedom. That such overreach may not have been so bad for Columbia this time around will be no comfort when&#8212;the precedent having been set, the power-grab politically normalized&#8212;things get worse later for it and other institutions.  Better to join forces with other universities and hold the line. It&#8217;s not too late for Columbia to do so.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/03/24/columbia-trump-peril-appeasement/">Columbia, Trump, and the Peril of Appeasement</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
