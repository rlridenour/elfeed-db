Apple has quietly expanded availability of its music transfer tool to seven additional countries, allowing users to import playlists and libraries from competing streaming services directly into Apple Music.<br/>

The feature initially launched in Australia and New Zealand in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/apple-music-transfer-tool/">May 2025</a>, and is now available in Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States, according to an updated <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118249">Apple Support document</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The transfer tool lets users migrate their saved music, albums, and playlists from services like Spotify through a partnership with SongShift. Users can initiate transfers through the Apple Music app on iPhone/iPad via the Music app settings menu (On iPhone, go to Settings ➝ Apps ➝ Music ➝ Transfer Music from Other Music Services). <br/>
<br/>
If you don't see the above option, go to <a href="https://music.apple.com">music.apple.com</a> in your web browser, sign into your Apple Account, then click your profile picture in the top-right corner and select Transfer Music.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Music attempts to match songs in its catalog, flagging items that need review when exact matches aren't found. Only user-created playlists can be transferred, not service-generated ones.<br/>
<br/>
The expansion may indicate Apple is readying the tool for further international rollout in the coming months.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/26/apple-music-transfer-tool-6-more-countries/">Apple Music Transfer Tool for Switching From Spotify Now Available in US and 8 Other Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-transfer-tool-for-switching-from-spotify-now-available-in-us-and-8-other-countries.2464051/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
