<p>News of the prize was announced by <a href="https://time.com/7323933/berggruen-prize-michael-sandel-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Time</em></a> magazine.</p>
<p>In a press release about the prize, the Institute said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The impact and reach of his exploration of morality, dignity, and the common good within society and public discourse are unrivaled. “Professor Sandel’s work has left a profound mark on the global intellectual landscape,” said Yuk Hui, Chair of the Berggruen Prize Jury. “His critiques of neoliberalism, meritocratic ideology, and populism speak to the most urgent questions of our time,” he continued. </em></p>
<p>Sandel is the author of <em>Liberalism and the Limits of Justice</em> (1982), <em>What&#8217;s the Right Thing to Do? </em>(2009), <em>What Money Can&#8217;t Buy </em>(2012), <em>The Tyranny of Merit </em>(2020), <a href="https://philpapers.org/asearch.pl?strict=1&amp;searchStr=Sandel,%20Michael%20J.&amp;filterMode=authors">among other works</a>. He is also known for his public philosophy, including his BBC programs <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nmlh2">The Public Philosopher</a> </em>and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075ft6f"><em>The Global Philosopher</em></a>. He has participated in many public forums, and according to the Institute, &#8220;his lectures have packed such venues as St. Paul’s Cathedral (London), the Sydney Opera House (Australia), Madrid’s Plaza de España, the Delacorte Theater in New York’s Central Park, and an outdoor stadium at Yonsei University in Seoul (S. Korea), where 14,000 people came to hear him speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://time.com/7323933/berggruen-prize-michael-sandel-interview/">interview at <em>Time</em></a>, when asked &#8220;If you were describing what you had done to win the prize, what would you say?&#8221;, Sandel said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>What I&#8217;ve tried to do is to use philosophy as an invitation to a more robust citizenship than we&#8217;ve become accustomed to, to prompt public deliberation about big questions that matter, such as what makes for a just society and how can we seek the common good. </em></p>
<p>The Berggruen Prize for Philosophy and Culture is &#8220;given annually to honor a thinker whose body of work has led us to find wisdom, direction, and improved self-understanding in a world being rapidly transformed by profound social, technological, political, cultural, and economic change.&#8221; The jury for this year&#8217;s prize consisted of Roger Ames, Antonio Damasio, Francis Fukuyama, Yuk Hui, Siri Hustvedt, Carlo Rovelli, and Elif Shafak.</p>
