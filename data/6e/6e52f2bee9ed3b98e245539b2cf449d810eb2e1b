Several third-party case manufacturers are banking on leaked iPhone 17 designs, with companies like <a href="https://www.spigen.com">Spigen</a>, <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/ghost/iphone-17-pro-clear-cases">Dbrand</a>, <a href="https://www.nudient.com">Nudient</a>, and <a href="https://www.ipitaka.com">Pitaka</a> all showcasing nearly identical case cutouts several days before Apple's "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/26/apple-september-2025-event/">Awe dropping</a>" iPhone event.<br/>

MacRumors readers have contacted us about the cases, many of which prominently feature space for the rumored camera bar redesign for the iPhone 17 Pro models. The cases clearly show cutouts for the expected horizontal camera array stretching across the device's back,  with dummy units showing three 48MP lenses positioned on the left side and flash/LiDAR components on the right.<br/>

Elsewhere, case makers are confidently divulging sizing details through <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Diphone%2B17%2Bcases%26crid%3D3W0CNQEQIL2KN%26sprefix%3Diphone%2B17%2Bcase%252Caps%252C212%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1">Amazon listings</a>, suggesting both the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro will sport 6.3-inch displays. Meanwhile, Pitaka has quietly added iPhone 17 series pages to its website, all reflecting the same basic design language.<br/>

That includes the all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air – replacing the Plus model – which appears slimmer and has a single rear camera mounted on a runway-style bar.<br/>

What makes case makers so sure of their designs? The industry has a well-established supply chain intelligence network. Case manufacturers typically receive specifications from factory sources or Apple's accessory partners months in advance, but rarely from Apple directly (unless they are close case brand partners who hold their cases back until Apple's big reveal). The process often allows them to begin production runs before Apple's official announcements, thereby avoiding the costly scramble that would otherwise follow iPhone launches.<br/>

Unless Apple has somehow hoodwinked the entire case maker industry, given the remarkable consistency across multiple manufacturers, these leaked designs almost certainly represent Apple's final specifications. Whether they actually represent an improvement in terms of user experience remains to be seen.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/05/case-makers-reveal-iphone-17-designs/">How Do Case Makers Reveal iPhone 17 Designs Before Apple?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-do-case-makers-reveal-iphone-17-designs-before-apple.2464705/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
