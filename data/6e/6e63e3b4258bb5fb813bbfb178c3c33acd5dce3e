<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.177434/page/n447/mode/2up">index</a> to David Lloyd George&#8217;s 1938 <em>War Memoirs</em> <a href="https://archive.org/details/lastveteran00pete_0/page/120/mode/2up">sums up his feelings</a> about Field Marshal Douglas Haig:</p>
<p>his refusal to face unpleasant facts<br />
his limited vision<br />
Germans accustomed to his heavy-footed movements<br />
his stubborn mind transfixed on Somme<br />
his misconceptions concerning morale of German army<br />
obsessed with Passchendaele and optimistic as to military outlook<br />
none of his essential conditions for success prevail at Passchendaele<br />
misrepresents French attitude<br />
his plans strongly condemned by Foch<br />
misleads Cabinet about Italian Front<br />
prefers to gamble his hopes on men&#8217;s lives than to admit an error<br />
completely ignorant of state of ground at Passchendaele<br />
fails to appreciate the value of tanks<br />
not anxious for success on Italian Front<br />
a mere name to men in the trenches<br />
narrowness of his outlook<br />
incapable of changing his plans<br />
his judgement on general situation warped by his immediate interests<br />
his fanciful estimates of man-power<br />
jealous of Foch<br />
does not expect big German attack in 1918<br />
distributes his reserves very unwisely<br />
his conduct towards Fifth Army not strictly honourable<br />
his unwise staff appointments<br />
his defeatist memorandum of 25/3/18<br />
unfairly removes Gough from command of Fifth Army<br />
his complaints as to lack of men unjustified<br />
does not envisage Americans being of use in 1918<br />
stubbornness<br />
unreliability of his judgments<br />
launches successful attack of 8/8/18 [&#8230;] but fails to follow it up<br />
his censorious criticism of his associates<br />
his attempt to shirk blame for March, 1918, defeat<br />
only took part in one battle during War</p>
<p>Also: &#8220;unequal to his task&#8221;, &#8220;industrious but uninspired&#8221;, &#8220;did not inspire his men&#8221;, &#8220;entirely dependent on others for essential information&#8221;, &#8220;the two documents that prove his incapacity&#8221;, &#8220;unselfish but self-centred&#8221;, &#8220;his inability to judge men&#8221;, &#8220;liked his associates to be silent and gentlemanly&#8221;, &#8220;his contempt for Foch&#8221;, &#8220;his intrigues against Lord French and Kitchener&#8221;, &#8220;his failure at Loos&#8221;, &#8220;his ingenuity in shifting blame to other shoulders than his own&#8221;, &#8220;his shabby treatment of Gough&#8221;, and &#8220;his conspiracy to destroy General Reserve&#8221;. He found in Haig&#8217;s diaries &#8220;a sustained egoism which is almost a disease.&#8221;</p>
