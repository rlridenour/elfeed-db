Intel introduced <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/client-computing/ces-2026-intel-core-ultra-series-3-debut-first-built-on-intel-18a">its latest processors</a> at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/">CES 2026</a>, debuting the "Panther Lake" Intel Core Ultra Series 3. The chips are the most advanced manufactured in the U.S., according to Intel, and they are built on Intel's 18A process.<br/>

18A, or 18-angstrom, is the most advanced node Intel has designed to date, but Intel continues to trail TSMC. TSMC is developing Apple's next-generation 2nm chips, and they are expected to have higher transistor density and efficiency than Intel's 18A chips.<br/>
<br/>
Intel is developing several chips in the Ultra Series 3 line for both high-end and low-end laptops, with the top SKUs offering up to 16 CPU cores, 12 Xe cores (Intel's graphics architecture), and 50 NPU TOPS. Compared to prior-generation chips, Intel claims the Ultra Series 3 processors will bring up to 77 percent faster gaming performance, 60 percent better multithreaded performance, and up to 27 hours of battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Apple doesn't use Intel chips anymore, so the new Core Ultra Series 3 processors will be exclusive to PCs, but there are rumors that Intel could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/28/intel-rumored-to-supply-new-mac-chip/">manufacture some Apple chips</a> in the future. According to Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Intel will make lower-end M-series chips for Apple's Macs built on the 18A process, using Apple chip designs. Intel could begin shipping chips to Apple as soon as mid-2027.<br/>
