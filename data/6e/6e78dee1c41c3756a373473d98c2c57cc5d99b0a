  <p>Whatever we call it (Diamorph or otherwise), I’m just glad to see
interfaces getting weird and wonderful again. We’re not going
back. We’re going forward — with depth, with texture, and maybe
even with a little joy.</p>

<p>Depth is good — humans innately understand three dimensions. Texture is good. We’ve lost so much over the last decade. I hope that’s where Apple is heading back.</p>
