<p>The macOS Preview app does a great job inserting signatures to existing pdfs. I was hoping it could overlay images just as easily. Doesn't look like it's possible, without exporting/reimporting to image formats and losing pdf structure. Did I miss something?</p>
<p>In any case, I found <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/formulatepro/">formulatepro</a>. Dormant at Google Code Archive, but also <a href="https://github.com/adlr/formulatepro">checked in to github</a>. With a tiny <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/formulatepro/commit/cd43b1e73c2f180f4b4b7fb11fdec975b6960dc6">patch</a>, it builds and runs on Catalina. One can easily insert an image via &quot;File &gt; Place Image…&quot;.</p>
