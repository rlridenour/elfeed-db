<p>Here’s a spoof commercial from the 1990 movie <em>Crazy People</em>, starring Dudley Moore and Daryl Hannah, <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/16814-crazy-people">which TMDB synopsizes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bitter ad executive, who has reached his breaking point, finds
himself in a mental institution, where his career actually begins
to thrive with the help of the hospital’s patients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The New York Times <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/26/young-chinese-women-have-small-fingers">would have you believe</a> this is relevant to Apple’s supply chain reliance on China.</p>
