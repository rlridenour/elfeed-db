Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17e may feature the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, according to a known online leaker.<br/>

The leaker known as "Digital Chat Station" shared the information on Weibo in the comments of a <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Qb3zgwSl7">post</a> detailing that Apple's apparent plan to equip next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro models with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/27/iphone-18-pro-variable-aperture-camera/">variable aperture lens</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; is a pill-shaped interactive area at the top of the screen that displays ongoing activities, incorporating the camera and other front-facing sensors. It was introduced in place of the "notch" with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro Max and expanded to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15 Plus a year later. It has yet to be present on any entry-level iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
The leaker added that despite the presence of the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will retain a 60Hz OLED display. This would mean the device essentially shares the same panel as the 6.1-inch &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 15 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, which seems believable as Apple's entry level devices largely re-use slightly older technology from other products.<br/>
<br/>
The leaker corroborated reports that the device will launch in the first half of 2026, probably around a year after the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> in February. It is likely to feature the A19 chip, with few other enhancements.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/27/iphone-17e-could-feature-dynamic-island/">iPhone 17e Could Feature Dynamic Island</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17e-could-feature-dynamic-island.2469899/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
