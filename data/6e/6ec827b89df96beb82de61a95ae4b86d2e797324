<p>Stephen Robles has put together a great video breaking down Apple&#8217;s new Creator Studio subscription. If you&#8217;re wondering whether this new $12.99/month bundle makes sense for you, this is worth your time.</p>

<p>For those who haven&#8217;t been following, Creator Studio bundles Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Motion, Compressor, MainStage, and now Pixelmator Pro (which is coming to iPad for the first time). You also get premium features in the iWork apps. The education pricing is particularly aggressive at $2.99/month.</p>



<p>Stephen does a nice job walking through who this actually makes sense for versus who should stick with the one-time purchases. The math isn&#8217;t straightforward, and it depends a lot on how many of these apps you actually use.</p>



<p>One thing that caught my attention: the new Transcript Search and Visual Search features in Final Cut Pro. These are the kind of AI-powered tools that actually solve real problems for video editors. Being able to search your footage by what&#8217;s being said or what&#8217;s on screen is genuinely useful.</p>
