<p>Russia said it agreed to temporarily refrain from striking Kyiv and nearby towns until February 1 after President Trump requested the pause amid extreme cold, while Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said there was no formal truce in place. Several reports also described a parallel, tentative halt in attacks on energy infrastructure, though the timing, scope and enforcement terms remained unclear. Even with the stated pause around the capital, Ukraine reported continued overnight attacks elsewhere, including dozens of drones and a missile, underscoring how limited and fragile the arrangement appears and how quickly interpretations can diverge. Still, the move created a short window that officials said could help negotiations, and it may offer Kyiv’s residents brief relief during a dangerous cold spell as damage to the power system has left some areas without heating.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/KhdoHvYue0HkwG1ou8gRBFsq2YkI8NaAr2IIVZH_9w0PsAgCxHN1pIRkYVOU_u0P4c_SIS4_RKkVv_Yq7ocQB6V0aKGChqyVRq40EBcbTCU7' alt='Residents receive hot meals from volunteers at a government-run aid point during a power blackout in Kyiv on January 30, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Cold-weather risks: Reports warned temperatures in Kyiv could plunge to about -30°C, heightening concerns that damaged electricity and heating systems could trigger a wider winter humanitarian emergency.</li><li>Logistics targets: Even as Kyiv was reportedly spared for the period, one account said Russia continued focusing strikes on Ukrainian logistics targets rather than announcing a broad ceasefire.</li><li>Moratorium dispute: Russia and Ukraine both described a halt in energy-infrastructure strikes, but they differed on the moratorium’s timeframe and left uncertainty over how it would be defined in practice.</li><li>Terms unclear: President Trump said President Vladimir Putin agreed to a temporary pause in attacks on Ukraine’s energy sector, but reporting emphasized that key details—such as timing and scope—remained unspecified.</li><li>Attacks continue: Ukraine’s air force reported Russia still launched one missile and more than 100 drones overnight, indicating continued pressure despite any limited pause near Kyiv.</li></ul><blockquote>I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Kremlin (Dmitry Peskov): The Kremlin said President Trump personally asked President Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv for a week ending February 1, describing it as a step to create favorable conditions for negotiations.
