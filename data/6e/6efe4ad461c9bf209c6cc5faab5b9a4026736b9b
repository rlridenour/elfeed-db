</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
An #Emacs function defining an #OrgMode dynamic block so that I can easily insert a list of books I&rsquo;ve finished reading within a given month.
</p>
        <p><time datetime="2025" title="2025">This year</time> Jenny and I are participating in our local library’s reading
challenge.  We formed our own team, with the goal of the team reading 100 books.</p>
<p>On <time datetime="2025-09-12" title="2025-09-12">Friday</time> I read <a href="https://itinerantlibrarian.blogspot.com/2025/09/reading-about-reading-life-september-12.html">Reading about the reading life: September 12, 2025 edition</a>, in
which the author draws attention to <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2025/08/a-man-read-3599-books-over-60-years-and-now-his-family-has-shared-the-entire-list-online.html">a man who read 3,599 books</a> and hand-recorded
each book read; all books having come from public libraries.  Memorialized in
<a href="https://what-dan-read.com/">What Dan Read</a>.</p>
<p>I found Dan’s dedication inspiring—a simple bit of note taking sustained over
the decades.  That list, creating a bit of imortality, with its longitudinal
insight into the intersection of individual curiosity, collection curation, and
the currents of culture.</p>
<p>Drawing on that inspiration, I started thinking about my personal habits that
I’m establishing.  Namely writing journal entries then printing those out each
month.  I also use <span><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" title="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-ORG-MODE">&#128214;</a></small>
 to track my reading.  I have a single <span>Org-Mode</span>

document that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracks when I started, completed/abandoned reading a book.</li>
<li>Any quotes that I’ve gathered from that book.</li>
<li>Additional notes around the read.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote about some of this in Re-Wiring My Epigraphs Functionality to Leverage
My Bibliography File</p>
<p>So, drawing inspiration from Dan, I wrote an <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
 function:
<a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs/blob/1e83bb57da5555d0aae5256a8ccaec25fc4a9cb1/emacs.d/personal.el#L1151-L1211">org-dblock-write:books-finished</a>.  That function conforms to the Dynamic Block
API and I simply drop it into my <span>Org-Mode</span>
 document at some point within the
month’s entries.</p>
<p>What it does:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the month and year for the block</li>
<li>Query my Bibliography for books I finished reading</li>
<li>Insert into the document a list of those books, as links to those books</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, when I print my monthly journal, I’ll have a list of books I finished
that month.</p>
