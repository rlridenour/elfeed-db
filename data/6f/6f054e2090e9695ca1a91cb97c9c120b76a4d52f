<p>Peru’s Supreme Court has sentenced former President Pedro Castillo to 11 years and six months in prison for rebellion and criminal conspiracy, nearly three years after he tried to dissolve Congress and rule by decree in December 2022. Prosecutors said Castillo announced the dissolution of the opposition-controlled legislature, a reorganization of the judiciary and a nationwide curfew in what they described as an attempted self-coup to avoid a third impeachment attempt over corruption allegations and mismanagement claims. Lawmakers ignored his announcement, quickly voted to impeach him on the same day, and security forces arrested him as he tried to reach the Mexican embassy in Lima, while his vice president Dina Boluarte was sworn in as his successor. Castillo, a former rural teacher often described as Peru’s first president from a poor background, has rejected the charges, calling his removal illegitimate, and his lawyers are expected to appeal, leaving open further legal and political debate in a country already marked by years of institutional instability.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/L_ZbdG_WArWYenasyV2hOMzHhllx1ZD7snXD9LNujshy5lGevxpWWSaAQqLRV0H3xMdzv6Vq5-2O1jzIwVG6il3XlNCCkHJquC-rJtMSZda0K2R18R41xMfidxYEcfZgF7fe4ugq6rgQNTcRjvZyPWOuLWhL1U8AOvWO1VOXWQ' alt='Former Peruvian President Pedro Castillo appears in court as judges announce his prison sentence for rebellion and conspiracy.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Charges explained: The court found Castillo guilty of the crime of rebellion for attempting to dissolve Congress, as well as criminal conspiracy linked to that effort, rather than for broader corruption allegations that are the subject of separate investigations.</li><li>Sentence structure: Judges handed down a fixed term of 11 years, five months and 15 days in prison, reflecting Peru’s penal code ranges for rebellion combined with conspiracy, and ordered additional penalties including political disqualification and fines, according to local reports cited by international media.</li><li>Castillo’s background: Castillo worked as a rural primary school teacher and union leader in Cajamarca before winning the 2021 presidential election despite having no previous elected experience, which led many supporters to hail him as a representative of Peru’s poorest regions.</li><li>Political turbulence: During his 16 months in office, Castillo cycled through numerous cabinet reshuffles and faced repeated clashes with an opposition-dominated Congress, which had already initiated two impeachment attempts before the December 2022 crisis.</li><li>Future legal cases: Beyond the rebellion conviction, Castillo remains under investigation in other cases involving alleged corruption and influence peddling during his presidency, meaning his legal challenges will likely continue even as he serves this new sentence.</li></ul><blockquote>I was kidnapped and then illegally and unconstitutionally vacated by Congress - Pedro Castillo</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pedro Castillo: Castillo has argued that Congress removed him illegally and that he is a political prisoner, insisting that his attempt to dissolve the legislature was a legitimate response to its obstruction of his government.
