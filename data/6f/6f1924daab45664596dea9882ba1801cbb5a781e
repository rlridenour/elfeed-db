<p><strong>3D video with spatial audio:</strong> Coming soon, exclusively in <a href="https://sandwich.vision/">Sandwich Vision</a>’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/theater-the-future-of-cinema/id6502666560">Theater</a> on Vision Pro, available on the App Store. This year’s on-demand version of the show in Theater isn’t ready yet, but it looks <em>really</em> good. Better than last year’s by a long shot, and also significantly better than the bandwidth-constrained livestream Tuesday night. The livestream Tuesday night looked good; the on-demand version coming in a few days looks pretty amazing.</p>

<p>As ever, I implore you to watch on the biggest screen you can (real, or virtual). We once again shot and mastered the video in 4K, and it looks and sounds terrific. All credit and thanks for that go to my friends at <a href="https://sandwich.co/">Sandwich</a>, who are nothing short of a joy to work with.</p>
