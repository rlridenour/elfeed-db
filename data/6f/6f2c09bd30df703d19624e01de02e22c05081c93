A contribution to the July 2025 Emacs Blog carnival; this post is just a bit about my personal journaling environment.

Writing is a murky business: you are never entirely sure what you are doing or
when it will be finished and whether you got it right and how it will be
received months or years or decades after you finish.  What it does, if it does
anything, is largely imperceptible business that takes place in the minds of
people you will mostly never see and never hear from (unless they want to argue
with you).

<p>Much of my <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
 posts are around writing.  They highlight a journey of
discovery, one that is ever-unfolding.</p>
<p>At present, I’ve achieved what I consider a cruising altitude.  There will be
more things I add, but lately I’ve found myself pruning some dead-ends.  Code I
wrote that I thought I might use, but don’t.</p>
<p>I might leave those functions in <a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs/blob/44d646cf84ee16f90ffb3678743e54be577afa28/emacs.d/init.el">my init.el</a> or shuffle them off into a
graveyard which I can later revisit as a code necromancer or curious
archaeologist.</p>
<p>Of late, I’m using more of the basic functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capitalize word</li>
<li>Lower-case word</li>
<li>Transpose letter</li>
<li>Transpose word</li>
<li>Kill sentence</li>
</ul>
<p>The most significant shift has been my adoption of a daily journal.  I write
journal entries to a single file, using the following capture template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
'(&quot;j&quot; &quot;Journal Entry&quot;
   plain (file+olp+datetree
           jf/personal/filename-for-journal)
   &quot;{{{nt(%?)}}}&quot;
   :empty-lines-before 1
   :empty-lines-after 1
   :clock-in t
   :clock-resume t))
</code></pre>
<p>This appends the <code>{{{nt(%?)}}}</code> region into the day’s headline (e.g. “2025-07-29
Tuesday”).  The <code>nt</code> is a macro for a “new thought”; one that I render as small
caps.  I type a few words within the macro to indicate that I’ve started a new
writing session in my journal.  Then set about writing more.</p>
<p>I have found that this has meant less public writing, but more writing in
general.  The journal habit now becoming my incubator.  Sometimes I’ll go back
to previous entries and write a bit more.  This is me working out how I might
develop ideas given the patterns I’ve already adopted.</p>
<p>In the <time datetime="2025-07" title="2025-07">month of July</time> I’ve written around 16,000 words in my journal.  And at the
end of the month, I’ll export that month to a PDF, using <a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs/blob/44d646cf84ee16f90ffb3678743e54be577afa28/lib/jf-journal.setup">my Journal setup LaTeX
template</a>.</p>
<p>The template does a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prints the entries on two columns</li>
<li>Prints the URL of hyperlinks as footnotes as well as clickable links in the
PDF.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, each time I use an abbreviation, I append that abbreviated term to
a list.  And then, once I’ve processed the content, I append an abbreviations
section to the PDF.  Thus including a localized glossary, that is a subset of my
larger glossary.  I wrote about that in 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/04/10/extending-org-mode-export-to-include-acronyms-section/">Extending Org-Mode Export to Include Acronyms Section</a></cite>.</p>
<p>In this “personal writing” I’m finding that my ritualization of thinking is
beginning to have me consider how I might develop these thoughts.  I’m also
recognizing that my work in software development is creating friction in
exploring my writing process.</p>
<p>First, I need to have the functional “needs” lead me.  Second, I need to
recognize that well organized and design code, while legible, does not itself
tell a story.  Though one might argue that going to an application’s router
helps tell the application’s story.  But moving through the layers of an
application does not follow a linear flow of presented ideas.</p>
