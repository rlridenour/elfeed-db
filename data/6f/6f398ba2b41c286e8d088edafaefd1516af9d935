<p>The United States and China began charging additional port fees on ocean shipping firms on Tuesday, opening a new front in their trade dispute that spans cargoes from holiday toys to crude oil [japantoday.com#1][dw.com#2][france24.com#5]. Washington argues China’s dominance in shipbuilding, logistics and maritime services stems from unfair policies, and President Donald Trump’s administration outlined the fee plan earlier this year to loosen that grip and bolster US shipbuilding [dw.com#2][firstpost.com#4][michaelwest.com.au#3]. Beijing responded with its own fees on US-linked vessels—defined as US-owned, operated, built or flagged—while exempting China-built ships and some empty ships entering for repair; charges are collected at the first port of entry on a single voyage or the first five voyages within a year under an April 17 billing cycle [michaelwest.com.au#3]. Analysts say China-owned container carrier COSCO could bear nearly half of an estimated $3.2 billion container-segment cost from US fees in 2026, while France 24 reported China has halted imports of US-produced soybeans, adding pressure for American farmers [michaelwest.com.au#3][france24.com#5].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/H_UCqmaLUlXQ3aiS1EQg3LH3pFxkp1nyhLGxJq7IK3eq2pXMubxSe6EtK3DlJ1td_GLZ1i_d2ActsHm-OCIpjpdUzrK9i1wEdl_NBGMAMlyehYYBkYNVm4_r3hU5C3RARWz4e-usPNz2dUbXssNBk4L-wHKNaQ1rFXO_0hWrEE9Lb2nNjBaZ4fAnFT05XQ' alt='Containers stacked at a port symbolize the maritime trade routes now facing reciprocal fees.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>What changed: Both countries began collecting new port fees on Tuesday, covering a wide range of cargoes and marking a maritime front in their trade dispute [japantoday.com#1][dw.com#2][france24.com#5].</li><li>US rationale: Washington says China’s maritime dominance reflects unfair policies, and the Trump administration’s plan aims to loosen that grip and support US shipbuilding [dw.com#2][firstpost.com#4][michaelwest.com.au#3].</li><li>China’s measures: China is charging US-owned, operated, built, or flagged vessels, with exemptions for China-built ships and certain empty ships entering for repair; bills follow an April 17 annual cycle [michaelwest.com.au#3].</li><li>Industry exposure: Analysts expect China-owned carrier COSCO to shoulder nearly half of the container segment’s projected $3.2B US fee cost in 2026 [michaelwest.com.au#3].</li><li>Farm impacts: France 24 reported China has halted imports of US-produced soybeans, straining American farmers amid the broader tensions [france24.com#5].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US administration: The US says Chinese dominance in maritime, logistics and shipbuilding stems from unfair policies, and fees are intended to rebalance and bolster US shipbuilding.
