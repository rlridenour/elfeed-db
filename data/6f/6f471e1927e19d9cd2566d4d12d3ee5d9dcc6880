<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 5 6-month subscriptions ($59.95 each) for <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44?utm_medium=vendor_program&amp;utm_source=Brett+Terpstra&amp;utm_content=link">Setapp</a>. A lot of the giveaways I&rsquo;ve been running are also available on Setapp. And the reason a lot of readers don&rsquo;t enter is because they&rsquo;re already getting these apps for one monthly payment of $9.99. There are over 250 high-quality apps available, including amazing tools like CleanShot X, my own Marked 2, Ulysses, MindNode, and hundreds more.</p>

<p>This giveaway is only open to new customers. Existing customers are inelegible for the free 6-months, sorry.</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Power up your workflow with Setapp, a smart way to get apps.</p>
