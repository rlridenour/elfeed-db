<p>For years, I’ve been watching John Ternus at Apple events and thought he just carried himself like an Apple CEO. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/06/apple-leadership-shakeup-impending/">Rumors are increasingly pointing toward him</a> as Tim Cook’s successor. In my mind, this fits for a few reasons:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I think the next CEO will be someone already inside Apple.</li>



<li>I think the next CEO will need to be a younger generation than the existing senior management.</li>



<li>It needs to someone who can handle himself as the CEO of one of world largest companies, <em>like John Ternus.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Apple has a deep bench. I’ve met lots of Apple executives over the years, dripping in competence. But John Turnus is the only one they seem to find a reason to put in front of the public at every chance. I’ll be surprised if, when Tim Cook decides to step down, it’s not Ternus.</p>
