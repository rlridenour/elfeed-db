The next iPad Pro models could have even thinner bezels around the screen.<br/>

In a post on Chinese social media platform Weibo today, the account Instant Digital <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Pyvrbc8Wj">claimed</a> that the bezels on future iPad Pro models could be as thin as those on Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra tablet, although they said the iPad Pro will not have a notch.<br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital has more than 1.4 million followers on Weibo, and the account has accurately leaked Apple information before, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">Yellow finish for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus</a>, and the Apple Watch Ultra 2's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-introduce-redesigned-milanese-loop/">Titanium Milanese Loop</a>. However, like most sources, the account does not have a perfect track record.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/24/future-oled-ipads-ultra-slim-bezels/">covered a report</a> that said Apple is considering using LG's chip-on-film (CoF) technology for future iPad Pro displays. This would allow for display drivers to be positioned closer to the screen, which could allow for thinner bezels.<br/>

The bezels on the latest iPad Pro models with the M4 chip are already slightly thinner compared to the previous-generation models with the M2 chip, but it is believed that the reduction would be even more significant on the next iPad Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital did hedge their claim by saying that the ultra-thin bezels might not necessarily be ready in time for the next iPad Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said iPad Pro models with an M5 chip would enter mass production <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/m5-ipad-pro-mass-production-late-2025/">in the second half of 2025</a>. The current iPad Pro models with the M4 chip launched in May 2024, and Apple typically updates the iPad Pro on a roughly 18-month cycle, so the next models could be released in September or October this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/27/ipad-pro-ultra-thin-bezels-again-rumored/">iPad Pro Again Rumored to Receive Ultra-Thin Bezels Around the Screen</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-again-rumored-to-receive-ultra-thin-bezels-around-the-screen.2459786/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
