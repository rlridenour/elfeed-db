T-Mobile <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/tmobile-uscellular-acquisition/">announced the acquisition</a> back in May 2024, but it was contingent on regulatory approval. According to <em>Reuters</em>, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/fcc-approves-two-t-mobile-deals-after-wireless-carrier-drops-dei-programs-2025-07-11/">approved the merger</a> in mid-July after T-Mobile ended its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile sent the FCC a letter [<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10709912829018/1">PDF</a>] with a promise to end DEI on July 9, and the deal was approved two days later. T-Mobile said that it was eliminating its DEI-related policies "not just in name, but in substance."<br/>
<br/>
According to T-Mobile, the UScellular acquisition is a "big win for customers." Existing UScellular customers will be incorporated into the T-Mobile network. While UScellular users can keep their plans for the time being, T-Mobile will begin allowing them to the transition to T-Mobile unlimited plans "as networks and systems are integrated."<br/>

The MetroPCS acquisition was completed in 2013, and the Sprint acquisition was completed in 2020.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/01/t-mobile-completes-uscellular-acquisition/">T-Mobile Completes UScellular Acquisition</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-completes-uscellular-acquisition.2462630/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
