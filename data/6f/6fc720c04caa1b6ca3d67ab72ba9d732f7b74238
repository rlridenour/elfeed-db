<p>Speaking of Ken Case, the Omni Group recently posted its <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2025-post-wwdc-update">post-WWDC roadmap</a>. There are some nice new features heading to OmniFocus, including mutually exclusive tags (for things like priority and Kanban status), better repeat, and a new, third date field for “planned” dates. It all sounds pretty useful.</p>
