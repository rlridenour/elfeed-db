<p>President Trump has announced that he is invalidating executive actions, proclamations and directives from Joe Biden’s presidency that were signed using an autopen, a device that mechanically reproduces a person’s signature. In a Truth Social post, he claimed that roughly &quot;92 percent&quot; of Biden’s documents were signed this way and asserted that any such paperwork is now &quot;terminated&quot; and without legal effect, though he did not outline a formal legal process for reviewing or rescinding each order. Trump further alleged that Biden did not personally authorize the autopen’s use and warned that if Biden said otherwise he should face perjury charges, assertions that legal experts quoted in coverage describe as legally uncertain or baseless under existing guidance that allows autopens when authorized by the president. The move fits into Trump’s broader effort to quickly roll back Biden-era policies, especially on immigration and clemency, while also renewing his past attacks on Biden’s capacity while in office.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/rt3UpK6cJg_mNaIhhpZUptxXCfpK-D7ip4hVdJ_V1huablrTOWnmnFFt3G1mOAwjTWSor26MzLwaqlN1Aeo8_PtkDsiBkDyU-4OosnebbIrl' alt='President Trump speaks to US service members by video from his Mar-a-Lago club on Thanksgiving, shortly before announcing his move against Biden-era autopen orders.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Autopen precedent: A 2005 opinion from the US Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel concluded that presidents may lawfully use an autopen to sign bills and other documents, as long as they authorize the device’s use for that purpose.</li><li>Common White House tool: Autopens have been used by both Democratic and Republican presidents for decades, typically when they are traveling or otherwise unable to sign documents in person, and the machine physically reproduces their handwritten signature in ink.</li><li>Legal commentator view: A legal commentator cited by the Times of Israel noted that while a sitting president can revoke earlier executive orders, they cannot unilaterally declare other presidential acts or pardons criminal or illegitimate without going through established legal processes.</li><li>Focus on clemency use: Biden’s late-term use of his clemency powers, including a large batch of pardons and commutations, drew particular scrutiny from critics who argued some decisions were rushed, and Trump now questions those actions if signed via autopen.</li><li>Political messaging angle: News outlets report that Trump’s sweeping &quot;92 percent&quot; claim and threat of perjury charges are part of a broader political narrative portraying Biden as not in control of his own presidency, a characterization that his allies reject.</li></ul><blockquote>Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen, which was approximately 92 per cent of them, is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Trump says he is cancelling all executive orders, proclamations and directives not directly signed by Biden because, he claims, aides operated the autopen illegally without Biden’s involvement and that such documents therefore lack legal force.
