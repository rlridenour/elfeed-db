I always forget how to schedule my emails and it&rsquo;s a pain to look up because Gnus uses the word &ldquo;delay&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;schedule&rdquo;, so here it is. Note that for gnus message scheduling (delaying) to work, you will need a line like this in your init file:
(gnus-delay-initialize) In a message buffer with Gnus you can execute C-c C-j (gnus-delay-article) to schedule an item for a later sending. After that I see it scheduled in my nndraft:delayed folder with a &ldquo;date&rdquo; line describing the time at which it will be sent.
