<p>Friday morning did not start well. I swung a leg out of bed, and made gentle contact with our 18-year-old cat Bianca, who was crouched miserably by the side of the bed. Then I noticed spots of blood. Lots of them. I checked her and the clues in the blood-spattered environment over carefully, and &mdash; long story short &mdash; the blood was coming from her urinary tract.</p>
<p>Like many older cats, Bianca has kidney disease. Evolution (and selective breeding in domestic cats) has provided cats with many excellent adaptations, but their kidneys are a weak point. She was diagnosed in a health check earlier this year, and she is already on a renal diet, and taking medication to lower her blood pressure, as hypertension is a common side effect of chronic kidney disease.</p>
<p>We booked an urgent vet appointment and got her checked over. The vet thought that it was most likely a urinary tract infection. She gave her a painkilling injection to make her more comfortable, and we got some antibiotics and more painkillers to take home, with instructions to check her in to the vet hospital for IV fluids and antibiotics if she didn&rsquo;t improve over the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>This was all on the hottest day of the year so far. Once home, she settled on a spot on the upstairs landing, right at the top of the stairs. Cats need to uphold their standards for benign domestic obstruction &mdash; even when unwell &mdash; after all. We had a box of puppy pee pads from when our other cat, Bella, was at the end of her life and suffering from lymphoma, so we liberally spread the pads around wherever she wanted to go.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day, we followed her around like the anxious 18th Century domestic cat staff we are<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, asking Madam solicitously if she will &ldquo;but try to take a little water or nourishment&rdquo;, and monitoring her litter box visits. Gradually, she started to pick up, and ate and drank a little.</p>
<p>None of us could sleep that night because of the stifling heat and the worry (and the pain of a UTI in the case of Bianca). Tiny disconsolate miaows drifted in from the landing, and periodically we went to lie down on the carpet beside her, giving her the head scritches and strokes she wanted. The next morning, she was definitely brighter, and thankfully in the couple of days since, the antibiotics and the painkillers seem to have done their job and she is eating, drinking and using the litter box as normal. It&rsquo;s such a relief, but probably a temporary one. We have to acknowledge that she is a grand old age for a cat, and that kidneys don&rsquo;t recover their function. All we can do is care for her the best we can, and make sure that she is as comfortable and pain-free as she can possibly be so that she can enjoy the rest of her life with us, and we can continue to enjoy her living her best cat life.</p>
<p>One of the perks of being a cat is &mdash; not unreasonably &mdash; being able to reject having much-needed medication squirted into your mouth. We have had very little success with getting her to take meds in pill form, except for the blood pressure pills which are apparently flavoured like chicken, and we can smuggle into a tiny pinch of tinned tuna, which is now her breakfast <em>amuse-bouche</em>. Given this history with pills, the vet prescribed liquid medications. The painkiller is (according to the packaging) roast chicken flavour, and should be (ideally) applied to the skin of the inside of the cheek, rather than being swallowed. Good luck with that&hellip;</p>
<p>The antibiotics are a liquid suspension which, the box optimistically insists, are &ldquo;Palatable Drops&rdquo;. They smell of strawberries. Logically, they probably taste of strawberries too, but given that the antibiotic in question is penecillin, and that both Mr. B. and I are allergic to penecillin, I can neither confirm no refute that hypothesis. But we all know that cats love the taste of strawberries, right? Famous for it, they are.</p>
<p>Anyway, sadly, Bianca was not on the focus group for that formulation, and she would like it to be known throughout the land that she DOES NOT LIKE STRAWBERRY. Additionally, she does not like plastic syringes near her mouth, and she definitely does not like strawberry-flavoured penecillin being squirted into her mouth. Before you ask, yes we tried smuggling it on to her food, but &mdash; this will shock you &mdash; it made her run away from her beloved tuna <em>amuse-bouche</em>.</p>
<p>She seems to be pain-free now, thankfully, so we don&rsquo;t need to hone our cheek-targeting accuracy with the painkiller, unless her condition worsens. However, antimicrobial resistance caused by antibiotic misuse is a real and dangerous problem, so we have to do our absolute best to continue the twice-daily antibiotic struggle for a whole seven days. We are currently on Day 2.5. When the vet&rsquo;s receptionist handed over the medication and explained dosages and so on, she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not allergic to penecillin are you?&rdquo;. When I said yes, she went a bit pale and told us to be very careful. The unspoken phase was, once again, &ldquo;Good luck with that&hellip;&rdquo;. I mean, I don&rsquo;t think either of us is so allergic that we would be affected without actually ingesting penecillin, but when you are trying to squirt strawberry penecillin into the mouth of a strawberry and syringe-hating cat who has elite passive-resistance skills, anything can happen.</p>
<p>Wish us luck for the next 4.5 days.</p>
