<p>Belgian authorities have charged former European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini with procurement fraud, corruption, conflict of interest and violating professional secrecy in connection with EU-funded training contracts for future diplomats, awarded to the College of Europe graduate school she now leads in Bruges. She and former European External Action Service (EEAS) secretary-general Stefano Sannino, along with a staff member of the College of Europe, were detained on Tuesday in Belgium after coordinated police raids at the College and at EEAS premises, then released from custody on Wednesday as they were deemed not to be a flight risk. The European Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office (EPPO) is investigating whether a 2021–22 public tender for the EU Diplomatic Academy was improperly steered in favor of the College of Europe, and has formally notified all three individuals of the accusations as the inquiry continues. Prosecutors and multiple reports stress that the allegations have not been proven and that Mogherini, Sannino and the third suspect are presumed innocent unless a court finds otherwise, underscoring that this is an early procedural step rather than a verdict.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ceUgLoEPFkRB1U_OFDq024n6nXw5HoZIIbTn92ywyIyNY1re3dFKwOoRF_5Yy1u02-QJLbKpEvOFc1X4J2CT6tngWL0DHtJSSxDvepUmJs0uPn0YaLd2bAFtpBkd_jKEzVFfyhqCaV4a6S1ytocMi95MDZtdEKCdfgaOYz52EfuEk44ukCCvf82DSRolFDCKEIkb8f24OlaXjQbFi--pqEJ3K2mNx5em' alt='Federica Mogherini, then EU foreign policy chief, pictured in Brussels in 2018.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Raids conducted: Investigators carried out searches both at the College of Europe campus in Bruges and at the European External Action Service offices as part of the suspected tender-rigging probe.</li><li>Diplomatic academy: The case centers on an EU Diplomatic Academy program intended to train future European diplomats, for which the College of Europe won a public contract during the 2021–22 procurement cycle.</li><li>Roles of suspects: Mogherini serves as rector of the College of Europe while Sannino previously headed the EU foreign service, and a third suspect is described as a College of Europe staff member.</li><li>Custody status: The EPPO confirmed that after questioning, all three were released because they are not considered likely to abscond, though the criminal investigation remains open.</li><li>Scope of accusations: According to the EPPO, the alleged offences include both corruption-related and secrecy-related breaches linked to how confidential information around the tender may have been handled.</li></ul><blockquote>They were released, as they are not considered a flight risk - European Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office statement</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office (EPPO): The EPPO stated that the accusations involve procurement fraud, corruption, conflict of interest and violation of professional secrecy related to the tender for the EU Diplomatic Academy.
