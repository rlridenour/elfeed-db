<p>Since 2021, Six Colors has been compiling an annual <a href="https://sixcolors.com/tag/reportcard/">report card</a> focusing on how Apple’s doing in large organizations, including businesses, education, and government. We formulated a set of survey questions that would address the big-picture issues regarding Apple in the enterprise, and we ask them every year.</p>
<p>If you’re part of the Apple IT community and would like to participate in this year’s survey, <a href="https://forms.gle/ugKtjjYofZnRpvnN9">it’s just a click away</a>. Results will be posted at the end of the month.</p>
