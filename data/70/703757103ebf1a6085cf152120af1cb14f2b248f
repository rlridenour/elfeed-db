<p>In previous years, Apple would announce finalists for its annual Apple Design Awards and then roll out the winners at WWDC. There used to be a whole ceremony, back in the day. But now Apple has compressed the entire process, and on Tuesday it <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/">announced both the finalists and the winners all at once</a>.</p>
<p>Honorees were chosen across the categories Delight and Fun, Inclusivity, Innovation, Interaction, Social Impact, and Visuals and Graphics, and include addictive card game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id6502453075">Balatro</a> (a winner), Panic’s charming game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thank-goodness-youre-here/id6504887308?mt=12">Thank Goodness You’re Here</a>, and (a double nominee) the amazing visionOS tower defense game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gears-goo/id6471676214">Gears &amp; Goo</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/">complete list is available from Apple</a>, of course. Congratulations to all the winners and nominees.</p>
