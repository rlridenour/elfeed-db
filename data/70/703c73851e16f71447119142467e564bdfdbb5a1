Apple introduced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max yesterday and gave members of the media some hands-on time with them. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera was able to take a look to check out the new design and share his first impressions.<br/>

Rather than using titanium and glass, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models have a unibody aluminum frame. There's aluminum around the camera plateau and at the back except for where there's a Ceramic Shield insert for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charging. The camera plateau is much bigger, and there's a two-tone look thanks to the aluminum and Ceramic Shield design.<br/>
<br/>
The updated iPhones feel solid and well built, and Apple promises that durability and scratch resistance have improved. Apple added a new anti-reflective coating, and while it's not a dramatic change, it does cut down on glare.<br/>
<br/>
The new dark blue and orange color options are attention grabbing, but Apple didn't provide a space black or space gray kind of option. It's silver, orange, or dark blue only this year.<br/>
<br/>
There's a new Telephoto lens that supports up to 8x zoom, and an upgraded front-facing camera that lets you take selfies in portrait or landscape mode without rotating your phone.<br/>

Apple is launching the new iPhones on September 19, and we'll have a more comprehensive review then.
