<p>Yasmine was just getting her drafting table set up in her new rented office space when she heard something at the door. Not a knock. Not someone trying the knob. No, the sound was more troubling than that: a key slipping into the lock.</p>
<p>“Um, it’s unlocked?” Yasmine called out.</p>
<p>A tall, handsome man opened the door and poked his head in. “But, how is that possible? I’m Nick, and I rented this office space to do my work designing digital fonts. Are you the previous tenant? Because you were supposed to be out by today.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not the <em>previous</em> tenant,” Yasmine said, growing annoyed. “<em>I</em> am the one who rented this place. To use as my calligraphy studio.”</p>
<p>“You must be mistaken,” Nick said, coming in. But, after reviewing their rental agreements, they realized that they had, somehow, managed to rent the same office space. Furthermore, the rental manager was on vacation. So they wouldn’t be clearing up the confusion today.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not leaving,” Nick said, beginning to defiantly unpack the various things he needed to design digital letters.</p>
<p>“And I’m not leaving either,” Yasmine said, unpacking the various things she needed to create ornate, hand-drawn letters.</p>
<p>But then something strange happened. They both unpacked the same thing at the same time from their separate boxes: a Sonos One speaker.</p>
<p>“I’m surprised you’d use something so digital,” Nick said.</p>
<p>“It was the best speaker for delivering rich, room-filling sound on the market,” Yasmine said. “And its compact design means <em>it</em> won’t be what cramps the space in <em>my</em> office.”</p>
<p>In response, Nick only smirked.</p>
<hr />
<p>They worked in silence for most of the morning, but shortly after lunch, Yasmine broke down.</p>
<p>“Look, I can barely concentrate with all of your loud typing,” she said, looking up from her drafting table. “I already plan to stay late to finish a big project, due at midnight, but you’re slowing me down even more!”</p>
<p>“I have a big project due at midnight, too,” Nick said, turning from his computer. “And the scratchy noise of your pen is like nails on a chalkboard for me. I’ve barely made any progress.”</p>
<p>“You know what?” Yasmine said. “Why don’t I just turn on some music, okay? I like to listen to masked acoustic artist Tina Stone’s songs while I work. It’s such luscious music. All the stringed instruments. Their carvings remind me of my favorite thing in the world: serifs.”</p>
<p>“Serifs are the worst!” Nick said with a snort. “My own preferred work music is that of masked digital musician Nina Cone, whose smooth ambient beats remind me of Helvetica.”</p>
<p>“When you’re a calligrapher, Helvetica is spelled with two L’s,” Yasmine said. “Look, how about we take turns. I listen to Tina Stone for an hour on my Sonos, and then you can listen to Nina Cone for an hour on your Sonos.”</p>
<p>“It’s a deal, I guess,” Nick said. So Yasmine connected her phone to her speaker and asked Siri to play Tina Stone, which was something she could do thanks to Apple AirPlay. And, although Nick would never admit it out loud, it really was nice working music. Especially with the Sonos’s rich, immersive audio.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was past five when Yasmine put down her pen and said, “Hey, Nick?”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry, is my music hour up?” Nick said, reaching for his phone.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that,” Yasmine said. “I just needed to ask you: do you really think serifs are the worst?”</p>
<p>Nick sighed. “Honestly, it’s complicated. You see, I used to love serifs. Because I used to love Sarah. And Sarah loved serifs more than anything. But then, she broke my heart. And now, whenever I see <em>them</em>, I think of <em>her</em>.”</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry,” Yasmine said, sincerely.</p>
<p>“Really, don’t be,” Nick said. “It’s not like I’m miserable all the time. It’s taken time, but I’ve been able to heal.”</p>
<p>“It’s almost as if your heart,” Yasmine said, “is certified renewed. Just like my Sonos One.”</p>
<p>Nick’s eyes welled with tears, and he said, “Yasmine, I know we just met, and we got off on the wrong foot. But I’ve really enjoyed working next to you today. And now, I want to tell you something, something I’ve never told anyone.”</p>
<p>They were leaning so far out of their chairs that, in the tight space of the office, their faces nearly touched.</p>
<p>“What is it, Nick?” Yasmine said, breathlessly.</p>
<p>“My Sonos is also certified renewed,” Nick whispered.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Dammit, it’s no use,” Nick said, rubbing his face to keep himself awake. “There’s forty-six minutes until my midnight deadline, and I won’t finish.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t I turn my music off and you turn yours on?” Yasmine offered.</p>
<p>“But don’t you have a deadline too?” Nick asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, but I don’t mind,” Yasmine said.</p>
<p>“Really, you’d do that for me?” Nick said.</p>
<p>But before Yasmine could say she’d do anything for him, both of their phones buzzed at once. They’d each gotten the same email at the same time: a new album had been released. By <em>their</em> favorite artist.</p>
<p>“But no,” Nick said.</p>
<p>“It can’t be,” Yasmine said.</p>
<p>“‘<em>Unmasked</em>’,” Nick read aloud, “‘is the newest offering from the musical artist Mina Rhone, and the first for which she will use her real name. Combining the lush instrumental music of her Tina Stone projects with the ambient soundscapes of her Nina Cone projects, it’s an album that fans across the hand-played and digital-made spectrum will love.’”</p>
<p>“So, she was the same musician all along,” Yasmine said. “And look at this: the new album is streaming now, and it’s exactly 46 minutes long! Quick, put it on your speaker!”</p>
<p>“No,” Nick said.</p>
<p>“No?” Yasmine said.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we both put it on our speakers,” Nick said, closing the small distance between them and taking Yasmine into his arms, “and pair them together for stereo sound.”</p>
<p>And then, their lips grazing, they whispered, in unison, “Because that’s something you can do with two Sonos Ones.”</p>
