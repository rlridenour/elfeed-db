Apple is set to announce its latest software updates, ranging from iOS 26 to macOS Tahoe, and there could always be a surprise or two in store.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap five key rumors heading into WWDC 2025:<ol><li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">iOS 26 instead of iOS 19</a></strong>, with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-rumored-design-details/">new Liquid Glass design</a>, preinstalled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-games-app-details/">Games</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-and-ipados-26-preview-app/">Preview</a> apps, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-messages-and-phone-features/">a simplified Phone app</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-messages-and-phone-features/">several new features for the Messages app</a>, and many other changes. iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26 are expected to have similar design changes as iOS 26.</li><br/>
<li><strong>No new hardware… probably?</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/08/new-airtag-nearly-ready/">A new AirTag is on the horizon</a>, but it is unclear if Apple will announce it during the WWDC 2025 keynote. And while Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/homeos-trademark-filings/">possibly trademarked homeOS</a>, the idea that it might unveil its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/homepad-preview-at-wwdc-2025-or-not/">long-rumored smart home hub</a> today is merely hopeful speculation at this point.</li><br/>
<li><strong>The more personalized version of Siri is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/genmoji-upgrade-for-ios-26/">reportedly still delayed</a></strong>, but some other Apple Intelligence enhancements are expected to be introduced today, such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-ai-backgrounds-mixmoji/">Mixmoji</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-ai-backgrounds-mixmoji/">revamped Shortcuts app</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/ipados-19-more-like-macos/">iPads may work more like a Mac</a>.</strong> For example, it has been rumored that at least some iPad models running iPadOS 26 will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ipados-19-mac-like-menu-bar-rumor/">show a macOS-like menu bar</a> while the device is connected to a Magic Keyboard.</li><br/>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/01/macos-tahoe-name-leaked/">macOS Tahoe is apparently the name</a></strong> of Apple's next Mac operating system, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/macos-26-rumored-to-drop-support-for-these-macs/">might drop support for several Intel-based Macs</a>.</li></ol>Stay tuned for in-depth coverage of all of Apple's announcements today.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/wwdc-2025-last-minute-rumor-recap/">WWDC 2025 Cheat Sheet: 5 Key Rumors Ahead of Apple&#039;s Keynote Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wwdc-2025-cheat-sheet-5-key-rumors-ahead-of-apples-keynote-today.2458419/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
