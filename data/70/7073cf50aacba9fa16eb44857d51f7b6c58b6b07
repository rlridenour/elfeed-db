Apple is still working on a next-generation version of the Studio Display, and <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris discovered signs of the new display in Apple code.<br/>

The upcoming Studio Display 2 has a codename of J427, and references to J427 were tucked away in software code that Apple didn't mean to publish. Rumors suggest that the next-generation Studio Display will come out in early 2026, so it makes sense that Apple is testing it now.<br/>
<br/>
We don't know a lot about the next-generation Apple display, but it is possible it will use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">mini-LED backlighting</a>. If the Studio Display does indeed adopt mini-LED technology, we can expect improved brightness, a higher contrast ratio, and better color quality.<br/>
<br/>
References to a display with the codename J527 were also found in the code. It's not clear what J527 is. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said earlier this year that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/2nd-gen-apple-studio-display-two-sizes/">developing two versions</a> of the Studio Display and would choose one to launch, so J527 could be a second variation of the Studio Display 2. It's also possible that it is a reference to a new version of the Pro Display XDR, but Gurman believes a second-generation Pro Display XDR is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/16/pro-display-xdr-2-and-larger-imac-rumors/">not a priority</a> for Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not launched a display product since it came out with the original Studio Display in 2022. It is not yet clear if the display will actually be named the Studio Display 2 or if Apple will give it another name.<br/>

The new model will likely come out alongside Macs with the M5 chip, with the Macs also slated for early 2026.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77">Mac Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-still-working-on-studio-display-2/">Apple Still Working on Studio Display 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-working-on-studio-display-2.2463341/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
