<p>Pope Leo XIV visited Istanbul’s historic Blue Mosque on Saturday, removing his shoes and touring the Ottoman-era complex with its imam and the city’s chief mufti in his first visit as pope to a Muslim place of worship during a four-day trip to Turkey. Reporters noted that while he bowed briefly on entering, he did not appear to engage in formal prayer inside the mosque, a gesture the Vatican has often framed as quiet reflection rather than shared worship in past papal mosque visits. Earlier in the trip he joined Eastern and Western patriarchs at the ancient Church of St. George, where they prayed together for greater unity among Christian churches, described as the central purpose of this first foreign journey of his pontificate. The day’s program in Istanbul also includes meetings with senior Turkish Muslim and Christian leaders, underlining a broader aim of encouraging dialogue in a country that bridges Europe and the Middle East.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/I5b8oTEkP1gAj5WPA66jl2qYfxS0GuVx0iREc_z-3cOxiHPjo2h1ctczGmcWsSgQyL0cH0dz92DtTewFOFZ_CBRz0-npTggEa-8GojJ8xep0kyk-13wWfK3XlG1KgE3c3NsUbwm6AfhUQte1IdUtvZSJ75JJLSiseyib0fI44w' alt='Pope Leo XIV tours Istanbul’s Blue Mosque alongside Turkish religious officials during his visit to Turkey.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>First foreign trip: Turkey is the destination of Pope Leo XIV’s first international journey since his election in May, with the Vatican presenting it as a primarily spiritual visit rather than a political one.</li><li>Guided mosque tour: At the Blue Mosque, the pope was shown its domes, tiles, and Arabic calligraphy by the head of Turkey’s Diyanet religious affairs directorate, alongside the mosque’s imam and Istanbul’s mufti.</li><li>Historic Christian venue: The pope’s joint prayer with Eastern and Western patriarchs took place at the Church of St. George, the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and a symbolic center for efforts to heal the Catholic–Orthodox divide.</li><li>Focus on dialogue: His Istanbul schedule includes separate meetings with Turkey’s top Muslim clerics and representatives of Christian minorities, signaling a dual emphasis on both interfaith and intra-Christian dialogue.</li><li>American-born pontiff: Leo XIV, the first pope from the United States, has made outreach across religious and historical divides a key theme early in his pontificate, reflected in the choice of Turkey—a majority-Muslim state with deep Christian heritage—for this inaugural trip abroad.</li></ul><blockquote>We have come here as pilgrims, asking God to heal the memories that divide Christians and to guide us on the path toward full communion in faith and love. - Pope Leo XIV</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pope Leo XIV: He has framed the Turkey trip as a pilgrimage aimed at strengthening ties with Orthodox Christians and encouraging respectful encounter with Islam rather than addressing specific political disputes.
