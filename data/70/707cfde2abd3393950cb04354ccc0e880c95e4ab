<p>Tens of thousands of Filipinos rallied in Manila and other cities on Sunday to denounce alleged large‑scale corruption in government flood control projects and to demand that funds be returned and senior officials prosecuted. Protesters, including clergy from the influential Roman Catholic Church, accused lawmakers, local officials and business owners of benefiting from so‑called &quot;ghost&quot; or substandard flood works in a country regularly hit by typhoons and severe flooding. Demonstrations were peaceful but heavily policed, with authorities deploying around 17,000 officers in the capital as crowds converged near key government sites. Organizers said they want stolen or misused public money redirected to genuine flood defenses and assistance for communities that have recently endured deep, prolonged inundation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qDJztwBP_8MoAfT3vANvtPA4A0f9Dn1JZVsMbxBWJq9sp0Ix8a86Q3_VZlr49UMQCJSRxxN8FUVXN4HLCMTGp5Zn3IWcY05Mzc7oB6AaE03_tgOvVI0m5pz5hELLJS90WD7cvLa5woOXBfr7USDraLo_ENJQSX_6qt97PtRPcg' alt='Demonstrators in Manila hold placards during nationwide protests over alleged corruption in flood control projects.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Church involvement: Priests and members of religious orders from the dominant Roman Catholic Church joined the rallies, lending moral weight to calls for accountability in the handling of public infrastructure funds.</li><li>Scope of allegations: The scandal centers on numerous flood control contracts that investigators and critics say were either overpriced, poorly built or never constructed, implicating scores of lawmakers, local officials and construction firm owners across multiple regions.</li><li>Security measures: Police set up checkpoints and roadblocks and banned backpacks and certain items near protest areas, saying the deployment of thousands of officers aimed to ensure order and deter possible violence while allowing demonstrations to proceed.</li><li>Impact of recent floods: Entire communities have spent days under chest‑deep water from recent typhoons, sharpening public anger that allegedly fake or defective flood projects may have worsened damage in the archipelago of more than 110 million people.</li><li>Legal demands: Protest leaders called for rapid, transparent investigations, criminal charges against those found liable, and mechanisms to freeze and eventually recover assets they allege were siphoned from flood control budgets.</li></ul><blockquote>We are tired of watching our people drown while corrupt officials enrich themselves - Unnamed protest leader quoted in report</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Protest organizers: Organizers say the gatherings are meant to pressure authorities to move quickly on investigations, recover allegedly stolen funds, and prioritize resilient infrastructure that can truly protect communities from worsening floods.
