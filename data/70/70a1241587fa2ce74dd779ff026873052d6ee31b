<p>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set its symbolic “Doomsday Clock” to 85 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been, saying catastrophic global risks are rising. In explaining the move, the group cited intertwined threats including nuclear tensions and conflict, climate change, and the fast-growing role of artificial intelligence in amplifying disinformation. While the clock is a metaphor rather than a prediction, the scientists urged leaders and the public to push for practical steps—especially renewed arms-control and risk-reduction—to pull the world back from the brink.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/NshQo4A-hv3AdEu_mWC31-c8hrYzBk38dEd0uPlcd_fl1OGJVszZaTCiuVRT-YKnjHEEJtfB4bFGSsHYj2zeIlOXlnsvJIJxoP3i-K095BAf72d3XJYw6ewOOuRTVaYQJCQ6ch1FHWRSJriOgB1CKxuFajVUKS-OmtsjYns3Vv0n0Uqf9uN6XsalQcmOlIgZboGSfZAHOK8' alt='The Doomsday Clock display at the Bulletin’s 2026 announcement.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Arms control gap: The Bulletin warned that the New START treaty is nearing expiration, which it said could leave the United States and Russia without any arms-control agreement and prompted calls to resume dialogue on limiting nuclear arsenals.</li><li>Disinformation focus: Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa argued that social media and generative AI have helped drive an “informational armageddon” that is not “anchored in facts,” a dynamic the Bulletin highlighted as a rising systemic risk.</li><li>Major-power posture: The group described major countries as becoming more “aggressive, adversarial, and nationalistic,” framing that shift as a driver of heightened danger alongside existing nuclear and climate risks.</li><li>Trump policies cited: Some coverage noted the clock update came during President Trump’s second term and reported the Bulletin’s criticism of proposed US missile-defense plans and of administration energy policy, arguing both could worsen strategic and climate-related risks.</li><li>Public leverage: The scientists emphasized civic pressure as a constructive lever—calling on the public to demand quick action from leaders on nuclear and climate threats as a way to reduce the risks the clock symbolizes.</li></ul><blockquote>Every second counts, and we are running out of time.
