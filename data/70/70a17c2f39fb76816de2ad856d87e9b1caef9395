Apple plans to offer the iPhone 17 Air in at least four colors, including Black, Silver, Light Gold, and Light Blue, <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-air-could-be-available-in-4-new-color-options/">according to a leaker known as Majin Bu</a>.<br/>

The new lighter blue color option for the device was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/iphone-17-air-standout-color-option/">first mentioned a day ago</a> by Fixed Focus Digital, a Weibo account with more than two million followers, and Majin Bu said that he has confirmed this information with his own sources.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if Light Gold and Light Blue will be Apple's actual marketing names for those colors, if this rumor proves to be accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Majin Bu said that the Light Blue color will be similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/sky-blue-macbook-air-photos/">Sky Blue finish offered for the latest MacBook Air</a>, so perhaps Apple would opt to extend the Sky Blue name to the iPhone 17 Air. This is merely speculation on our part.<br/>
<br/>
As a refresher, the iPhone 17 Air is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/iphone-17-air-dummy-model-video/">expected to be the thinnest iPhone ever</a>. However, the device is expected to have some compromises compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">worse battery life</a>, only a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">single rear camera</a>, only a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">single speaker</a>, and potentially either an A19 chip or a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/iphone-17-air-a19-pro-chip-rumor/">slightly limited version of the A19 Pro chip</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The device is also expected to have a 6.6-inch OLED display, MagSafe, and 12GB of RAM.<br/>
<br/>
Apple should unveil the iPhone 17 Air in September.<br/>
