<p><a href="https://mattgemmell.scot/back-to-mac/">Matt Gemmell</a> on switching back to the Mac after being iPad-only for a very long time:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Suffice to say then, that this was not a dalliance. The iPad was my one and only computer. I didn’t use a Mac for anything, unless I absolutely had to grab one for 5 minutes to get something done like flashing a new firmware onto a mechanical keyboard, or doing something on the (thankfully increasingly rare) web site that truly requires Chrome. Those recourses were countable on the fingers of one hand, per year. Until very recently, I don’t think I’d used a Mac in more than a year.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a long and thoughtful piece that has none of the drama you’d expect from the subject matter. Gemmell seems acutely aware of the limitations and advantages of both platforms.</p>
