<blockquote>
  <p>Mamdani won two-thirds of voters under 45 in preliminary <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2025/exit-polls/new-york-city/general/mayor/0">exit
polls</a>, while Cuomo led him by 10 points with voters 45 and
older. The polls also showed an education divide: College
graduates backed Mamdani by 55 percent, while voters without
college degrees narrowly favored Cuomo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“By 55 percent” is horrendously unclear writing. It could be misread to suggest that Mamdani won amongst college grads by a 55-point margin. He did not. CNN’s exit poll — the link cited by Knowles above — show Mamdani garnering 57 percent of the vote from college graduates, with Cuomo at 38, and Sliwa 5. Amongst voters without a college degree, it was Cuomo 47, Mamdani 42, and Sliwa 11.</p>

<p>Mamdani cruised to an easy win while losing amongst voters without a degree because in New York City, 59 percent of voters yesterday had college degrees.</p>

<p>That level of education in the electorate is <em>not</em> representative of the United States as a whole. In last year’s presidential election (for consistency’s sake, I’m <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0">citing exit poll data from CNN</a>), only 43 percent of voters nationwide had college degrees. Kamala Harris beat Trump 56–42 amongst those voters. Amongst the 57 percent of voters without a college degree, Trump won by almost the exact reverse split, 56–43.</p>

<p>Democrats, nationwide, don’t need to make gains with college-educated voters. They need to make gains amongst voters without college degrees. There’s no other demographic gap that is more crucial for Democrats to address. Education trumps race, gender, income, and age. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results">In 2020</a>, Biden won college grads 55–43, and Trump won non-college-grads by a mere 50–48.</p>
