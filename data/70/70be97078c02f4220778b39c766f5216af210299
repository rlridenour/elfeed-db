 
          <p>Fans of retro games will no doubt recognise the name: the Japanese video game composer and programmer Keiji Yamagishi is famous for his work on Ninja Gaiden and many other great (S)NES soundtracks during from tenure at Tecmo. Yamagishi-san moved on to produce his own chiptune music together with Brave Wave Productions when the gaming industry moved on from composing music in only eight bits.</p>
<p>His 2015 solo debut duo album, <em>Retro-Active Pt. 1</em> and <em>Retro-Active Pt. 2</em> has been on the daily playlist ever since I bought it. I&rsquo;m a sucker for 8-bit chiptunes neatfully mixed together with contemporary beats, which is exactly what you&rsquo;ll be paying for here. The first track on the first part, aptfully called <em>First Contact</em>, is enough to give you a taste of what you&rsquo;ll be in for:</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t stop there: Yamagishi-san collaborated with multiple other big hitters from the (retro) video game music world, such as Manami Matsumae (Mega Man, Trip World, Derby Stallion, &hellip;) and Ryuichi Nitta, his trusty co-composer who also worked on Ninja Gaiden.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best to let the music do the talking here. If the first track from <em>Pt. 1</em> hasn&rsquo;t convinced you, perhaps the first track from <em>Pt. 2</em>, <em>Thought Police</em>, will:</p>

<p>I also love the album cover art. If you simply can&rsquo;t get enough, there&rsquo;s a remixed version Brave Wave also put out that I have yet to discover. As always, both albums are available at Bandcamp. It looks like Keiji Yamagishi released a third related album in 2019 called <a href="https://bravewave.bandcamp.com/album/the-retro-active-experience">The Retro-Active Experience</a> which is a compilation of the first two and a few remixes. That&rsquo;ll be my reward for writing this and searching for the accompanied links. A quote from a random review left behind on Bandcamp:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yamagishi is a living legend.&rdquo; – CHIPTUNES WIN, Glenntai</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Happy Saturday!</p>
