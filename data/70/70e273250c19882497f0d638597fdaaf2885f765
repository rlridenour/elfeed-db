<p>France and Ukraine signed a letter of intent in Paris on Monday for Kyiv to acquire up to 100 French Rafale fighter jets, drones and advanced air-defence systems, with deliveries projected across the next ten years; leaders framed it as a long-term commitment to Ukraine’s security. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the accord &quot;historic&quot; while French President Emmanuel Macron said the deal reflects France’s desire to place its defence sector at Europe’s service, but some Ukrainians criticised the timetable and questions remain about funding and formal contracting. Officials and analysts warned the purchases will strengthen Ukraine’s long-term air capabilities but are unlikely to change the battlefield balance immediately as Russian strikes and winter pressures continue.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SIT00jcuKwlg3Dzxj5H_ZluU5MLghXfmabXsvymK2HIA8T3YKZUzdpYG7BCxXBKTGQT1cBpXvdeAPReWY2jdhJVAby5kAA_pZJ2Hy1xeezdXH0YLTQPeGYA-iAgmrs7uS0kgmLqMAY-7XLQD885UCggzMid_Z2z10-tI_WAPGYOP0pxUNuKgLjqzkundHzmRR4YychN9' alt='A Rafale fighter aircraft; France said on Monday it would sell up to 100 such jets to Ukraine.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ukrainian concerns: Some Ukrainian voices said the decade-long delivery schedule is too slow to meet urgent battlefield needs, expressing frustration with the timeline.</li><li>Funding uncertainty: Observers noted the leaders signed a letter of intent—not a binding contract—and questions remain over who will pay and how purchases will be financed.</li><li>Short-term effect: Analysts cautioned the Rafales would boost long-term capability but would not decisively alter front-line dynamics in the immediate months ahead.</li><li>Russian response: The Kremlin said it is watching developments and signalled interest in diplomatic engagement, including hopes for a potential summit with the United States to discuss the war.</li></ul><blockquote>This agreement reflects France’s will to place its defense sector at the service of Ukraine’s and Europe’s security. - Emmanuel Macron</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>France (President Emmanuel Macron): The accord reflects France’s will to put its defence sector at the service of Ukraine and Europe’s security, framing the package as a long-term commitment.
