<p>A new study &#8220;offers the strongest evidence to date that studying philosophy does indeed make people better thinkers.&#8221;<span id="more-54343"></span></p>
<p>Readers may recall the previous research of <a class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" href="https://michael.prinzing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="name wp-dark-mode-bg-image">Michael Prinzing</span></a> (Baylor) &amp; <a class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" href="https://michael-vazquez.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="name wp-dark-mode-bg-image">Michael Vazquez</span></a> (UNC), discussed <a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/10/01/the-benefits-of-studying-philosophy-not-just-selection-effects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here last year</a>, about how &#8220;philosophy majors tend to [show] more growth than non-philosophy majors&#8221; on some traits indexed by the Habits of Mind scale, a measure of intellectual dispositions.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/studying-philosophy-does-make-people-better-thinkers/45A7DE8F37BE4698265BD54490109D4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new article</a> published in the <em>Journal of the American Philosophical Association</em>, they elaborate on that but also share new data regarding how well philosophy majors do on standardized tests often required for admission to graduate programs, like the GRE and the LSAT, compared to other majors.</p>
<p>Unlike other lists you may have seen comparing how majors do on such tests, the ones created by Prinzing and Vazquez are an attempt to account for the fact that many students who choose to major in philosophy already have the skills needed to do well on such tests, and to instead show the difference that majoring in philosophy can make to their scores on them. So they control for SAT scores, so as &#8220;to remove the influence of pre-college confounds, thereby giving a more accurate estimate of the treatment effects.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what they say:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Starting with the standardized tests, we ran three separate models for scores on the GRE Verbal, GRE Quantitative, and LSAT. Unsurprisingly, SAT scores were significantly, positively associated with GRE and LSAT scores across the board. But crucially, after accounting for SAT scores, philosophy majors scored significantly higher than non-philosophy majors on the GRE Verbal and LSAT. On the GRE Quantitative, by contrast, there was no significant difference between philosophy and non-philosophy majors. </em></p>
