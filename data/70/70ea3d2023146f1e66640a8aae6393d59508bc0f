<blockquote>
  <p>Mike Cannon-Brookes, the CEO of enterprise software giant
<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>, was one of the first users of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462235/arc-web-browser-review">the Arc
browser</a>. Over the last several years, he has been a prolific
bug reporter and feature requester. Now he’ll own the thing:
Atlassian is acquiring The Browser Company, the New York-based
startup that makes both Arc and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/web/685232/dia-browser-ai-arc">new AI-focused Dia
browser</a>. Atlassian is paying $610 million in cash for The
Browser Company, and plans to run it as an independent entity.</p>

<p>The conversations that led to the deal started about a year ago,
says Josh Miller, The Browser Company’s CEO. Lots of Atlassian
employees were using Arc, and “they reached out wondering, how
could we get more enterprise-ready?” Miller says. Big companies
require data privacy, security, and management features in the
software they use, and The Browser Company didn’t offer enough
of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get it. Later in the same article, there’s this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As for what this all means for The Browser Company’s browsers,
it’s still too early to say for sure. Miller promises no
favored-nation features for Atlassian products, nor any Microsoft
Edge-style popups begging you to sign up for Jira. Miller says the
team is even more committed to being a truly cross-platform
product, and that Windows in particular is about to get a lot more
attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But “<em>How could we get more enterprise-ready?</em>” has never been a north-star principle for great user-focused software. I personally have never seen the appeal of Arc or Dia, but Safari truly speaks to me and my taste. Alternative browsers, by definition, are meant for people who are dissatisfied with existing browsers. So while I don’t use Arc or Dia, I’ve always been rooting for The Browser Company. I even dig the company name.</p>

<p>But this seems like bad news. I just don’t see how Atlassian/Jira DNA can possibly be a good thing to inject into an innovative user-focused web browser.</p>
