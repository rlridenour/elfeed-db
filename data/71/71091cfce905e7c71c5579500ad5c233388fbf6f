<p>Tens of thousands of Indigenous people and environmental activists marched through the streets of Belém, Brazil, on Saturday in the first major demonstration outside a UN climate summit since COP26 in 2021, pressing negotiators for stronger action and greater protections for the Amazon. Organisers called it the &quot;Great People&#x27;s March&quot; and the route covered roughly 4.5 kilometres under the tropical sun, with participants carrying a giant Earth ball, banners demanding reparations and Indigenous representation, and some displaying a Palestinian flag and an effigy of U.S. President Trump. The march followed earlier Indigenous-led actions this week that disrupted access to the COP venue and saw clashes with UN security, and authorities deployed soldiers to protect the summit site. Protesters demanded concrete results from negotiators, including more Indigenous representation and reparations for damage caused to marginalized communities by governments and corporations.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/P_TdnKy_-hjUvUbUFX_32iRylMho_pIUOWcOFGECzN2M9K7YHEijO1K7kaLy23UNzUsdBAwvNl6TcMqA4zo-1NUzdgnIc_zVy12dRBjp' alt='Activists fancy-dressed as widows gesture during a skit on &#x27;the death of fossil fuels&#x27; while taking part in a march on the sidelines of the COP30 UN Climate Change Conference in Belem, Brazil.—AFP' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Crowd estimates: Media and officials gave different attendance figures: Le Monde reported more than 50,000 participants while local police put the number at about 20,000, highlighting variation in crowd estimates.</li><li>March route: Organisers said the Great People&#x27;s March covered about 4.5 kilometres through Belém in hot conditions, ending near the COP30 venue where security forces were stationed.</li><li>Symbolic messages: Protesters combined climate demands with broader political symbolism — carrying a giant Earth, calling for reparations, and displaying Palestinian banners and an effigy of President Trump.</li><li>Summit disruption: This weekend&#x27;s march followed actions earlier in the week in which youth activists and Indigenous groups forced entry or blocked access to the conference, prompting clashes with UN security and heightened protective measures.</li></ul><blockquote>Today we are witnessing a massacre as our forest is being destroyed - Benedito Huni Kuin</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Takak Xikrin (Xikrin people): For the first time, at a COP event, we, the indigenous peoples, are occupying this space and speaking for ourselves.
