<p>Matt Haughey wanted just the right Volkswagen ID Buzz, and (despite living in Oregon) <a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/a-2-200-mile-ev-test-drive-from-texas-to-oregon/">he found it in Texas</a>:</p>

  The dealer quoted me $2,200 to ship it back to Oregon, but it would take a couple weeks and I figured I could drive that distance in just a few days for less money, plus, what better way to get to know a new car than to spend half a week in it?

<p>This is a great post about shopping for an EV, the current stage of EV charging in the U.S., and how Volkswagen has unfortunately managed to overemphasize touchscreen interfaces while also relying on capacitive touch controls.</p>
<p>Still, I love the look of that car. And I love the idea of getting to know a new car with a road trip.</p>
