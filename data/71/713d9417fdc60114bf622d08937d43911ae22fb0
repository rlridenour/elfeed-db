Python string APIs are powerful and concise, that is an important reason I use it to do a lot of scripting these days, <code class="verbatim">join</code>, <code class="verbatim">split</code>, <code class="verbatim">strip</code>, to name a few.</p>

Since I am learning Clojure recently, I am wondering, how is string manipulation like in Clojure and how to implement equivalent ones?</p>
<p>
I think it&#39;s an excellent opportunity to get familiar with Clojure. Before diving into the implementation, how to declare a multi-line string?</p>
