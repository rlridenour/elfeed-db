<p>Peru has declared a 60-day state of emergency along its southern border with Chile and ordered the armed forces to reinforce controls in the Tacna region, responding to a rise in people without documents trying to leave Chile ahead of a possible immigration crackdown there. President José Jerí said the measure aims to prevent irregular entries, combat human trafficking and other crimes, and manage what his government expects will be a larger flow of migrants moving north through Peru. Many of those on the move are Venezuelans who had previously migrated to Chile and now fear tougher policies if far-right presidential candidate José Antonio Kast, who has promised mass expulsions of people without legal status, wins the 14 December runoff election against left-wing candidate Jeannette Jara. The emergency order temporarily suspends certain constitutional guarantees in the border zone, but authorities have stressed that humanitarian assistance will continue to be offered by local governments and international organizations to families stranded between the two countries.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/R6hB9dtB1Bm_NZghjFldMFVt5K32f-ULDhDDD28p-DISHKF4V07-C1s151KNmCL7r3KWthx5_l7twMZ_zKQp9VKFwUFouzYCX8G6foWkXua0xRLjsN3K97J485Pf23STO7RBhSgKge-arwpmqm8286Cgnrm76lgXwEIz2PJr_m1_Z4lRzMs8v61Mf6oOE9aeS-hHzewC1jQEDPD4JBe9QvwwpR0lyFZZ_bvKtEHUgV69MWD9LZxyi-mQvQLHDVtZPVLmN6DIERbM6_1lZj4' alt='Venezuelan migrants rest near Chile’s northern border after unsuccessful attempts to enter Peru during heightened controls.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Runoff election backdrop: Peru’s 60-day emergency in Tacna is timed to extend beyond Chile’s 14 December presidential runoff between immigration hardliner José Antonio Kast and left-wing candidate Jeannette Jara, reflecting Lima’s expectation that political uncertainty in Chile will keep driving people north.</li><li>Reverse migration trend: The current flows mark a reversal of the past decade, when Peruvians and other Latin Americans moved south to Chile’s comparatively stable and prosperous economy, and now some migrants who had settled there are retracing their steps toward Peru and beyond.</li><li>Security and crime focus: Peruvian officials say the emergency decree is not only about migration control but also about tackling cross-border crime, including smuggling and human trafficking networks that profit from undocumented crossings in the desert border region.</li><li>Local strain in Tacna: Authorities in the Tacna region report that shelters, public services, and informal camps near the border have come under growing pressure as more families arrive with limited resources and no clear legal pathway onward.</li><li>Humanitarian support efforts: Municipalities, churches, and aid groups on both sides of the frontier have organized food distributions, temporary shelter, and legal guidance to migrants who are turned back at official checkpoints or become stranded between Chile and Peru.</li></ul><blockquote>We will not allow irregular entry into our territory, but we will not stop being supportive of those who need humanitarian assistance - José Jerí</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Peruvian government: President José Jerí framed the state of emergency as a necessary step to preserve order at the southern border while still allowing humanitarian aid to reach stranded families, saying the armed forces will back police in stopping unlawful crossings and criminal activity in the Tacna corridor.
