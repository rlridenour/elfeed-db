<p>Bit by bit I am getting to grips with <code>dired</code> and using this for more operations on my files.</p>
<p>The next step is to reduce the listing width so that a listing fits better in a smaller window.</p>
<p>Here is the format of my current listing:</p>

<p>By default <code>dired</code> uses <code>-al</code>, which gives a standard long listing.  Unfortunately for my work within emacs this is actually now too long, and also not just in emacs but in my terminal too.</p>
<p>After much hunting around the man page including potentially formatting the output and selecting the listing fields manually, I came to the conclusion that it is mainly the <em>group</em> and <em>user</em> I want to remove for the moment, and fortunately there are a couple of arguments that can do this for me:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">-g     like -l, but do not list owner
-G, --no-group
       in a long listing, don&#39;t print group names
</code></pre><p>and while scrolling through the man page I also thought that making the sizes human readable would also be useful, so I have come up with the following in my <code>.emacs</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(setq dired-listing-switches <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;-lGgha&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>to give me the following dired output:</p>

<p>This is much better, but can I now go further?</p>
<p>Well this is emacs, and you betcha!!!!</p>
<p>I know of the command <code>(</code> which when in dired mode hides the details and shows just the files.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to have this enabled by default?</p>
<p>A quick <code>describe-key</code> gives me the following function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(dired-hide-details-mode <span style="color:#66d9ef">&amp;optional</span> ARG)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But it is not clear how I can set this by default, there is nothing obvious in <code>customize-group</code> for dired, so now to the interwebs&hellip;</p>
<p>It looks as though I will need to add to the <code>dired-mode-hook</code> and set the details to be hidden when dired mode is activated as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">;; dired hide long listing by default</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(defun my-dired-mode-setup ()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;show less information in dired buffers&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (dired-hide-details-mode <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>))
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(add-hook <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;dired-mode-hook</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;my-dired-mode-setup</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Which now gives me:</p>
<figure><img src="https://emacs.dyerdwelling.family/ox-hugo/2022-11-23_15-23.jpg" width="300px">

<p>and now if I want show the details I just select <code>(</code> so effectively generally showing details rather than hiding them.</p>
<p>This makes more sense for my workflow in emacs, especially now my buffers and windows are getting a little more numerous and I am still really focussing on trying to use a single emacs frame on a laptop.</p>
