<p>Close ups crops of the Shelby brothers from Peaky Blinders. I painted these lads in oils &amp; colour pencil on paper. I think I&rsquo;ve finally excepted that you can quite reasonably paint with oils on paper in a sketchbook. Sometimes it can feel like a big block of resistance - the idea that we have to stretch, prime and prepare a surface or canvas for working with oil. It&rsquo;s not really the case. I made these in a budget sketchbook with just a quick wash of Gesso to prime the surface. Of course you will need to keep the sketchbook pinned open until it&rsquo;s dry.</p>
