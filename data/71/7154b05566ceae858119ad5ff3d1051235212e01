For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.lululook.com/">Lululook</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-iOS-Rechargeable-Smartcard-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB0DPFZ4MF7">Lululook Find My Tracker Card</a> to go along with it.<br/>

Lululook's Tracker Card works like an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a>, integrating with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> app on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. It's as thin as two credit cards so it can fit right into a wallet or passport, but it also has an optional lanyard on it so you can use it anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
Priced at &#36;23, the tracker's battery lasts for up to five months and it can be recharged using a Qi-based wireless charger or a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charger. All of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; features are supported, so you can get notifications when you leave your wallet behind, view the last known location on a map, and play a sound if it's nearby. It's able to leverage the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network, relying on other nearby iPhones for tracking if you're out of Bluetooth range.<br/>
<br/>
Lululook makes a range of accessories for iPhones, and if you need something to charge the Tracker Card, your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and other devices, Lululook has some affordable 3-in-1 charging options with Qi2, which offers up to 15W wireless charging. Qi2 is equivalent to &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, and it features the same magnetic connection.<br/>
<br/>
The &#36;70 Lululook Qi2 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Certified-Charging-Wireless-Magnetic%2Fdp%2FB0DHCXR9YQ%3Fth%3D1">3-in-1 Desk Charging Station</a> comes in colors to match Apple's iPhones. It features an upright Qi2 charging platform for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, an Apple Watch charger at the back, and an AirPods charging platform at the base. It's super compact and won't take up too much space on a desk.<br/>

Lululook's <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCertified-Compatible-Upgraded-Foldable-Wireless%2Fdp%2FB0DNYKDZ8H%2F%3Fth%3D1">3-in-1 Travel Charger</a> has multiple folding positions, and it can charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Apple Watch, and AirPods. When not in use, it folds up into a small square and can be tucked inside the included carrying case. It can unfold into a full three-device charger that can lay flat on a table, or it can be used upright with support for StandBy.<br/>
