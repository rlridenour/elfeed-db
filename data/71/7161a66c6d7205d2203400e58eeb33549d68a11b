<li>A 20,000mAh power bank with a big light on it?</li>
<li>Or a light that has a 20,000mAh power bank on it?</li>
<li>Yes!</li>
<li>Two USB-A ports and one USB-C port</li>
<li>Are they actually Limitless: No, but ‘Not-Very-Limited’ just didn’t have the same ring to it, you know?</li>
</ul><h1>Charge & See</h1><p>We sure are selling a lot of lights lately.</p>
<p>And we sure are selling a lot of power banks lately.</p>
<p>Do we regret it? No. Because lights and power banks are useful! The only problem is the thing they’re useful for: illuminating stuff and/or charging stuff.</p>
<p>And after a while, that gets to be a downer.</p>
<p>The situations in which you need a light or power bank range from annoying–your flight’s delayed on the tarmac with nowhere to charge your devices, or the power went out for the night–to dire–you’re on the side of the road with a broken down car, or you’re in the middle of an extended power outage.</p>
<p>So we decided to take a new approach. To prove these power banks with lights on them can be <em>cool</em> and <em>fun</em>, we sent some to our friend Terrance, the luckiest man in the world, and asked him to tell us what he thought.</p>
<p>Here’s what he wrote back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wow, thanks, Meh, for this product! I can’t believe how great it is!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I kept one in my backpack at all times. One night in particular, it came especially in handy. I was out with a few friends for beers. As it happened, I kept ordering pints from whatever keg was about to blow. The bartender filled glass after glass about three-quarters of the way up before the pour would start to sputter. Because of this, the bartender refused to charge me! Can you believe that?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anyway, I was on my way home, taking a shortcut across an old basketball court, when I stumbled on some uneven ground. I had been looking at my phone at the time, and it flew out of my hand! Luckily, it landed safely on a pile of paper, not a scratch of a dent on it. With the light on the power bank, I was able to see that the papers were actually lottery tickets. Just a whole bunch of lottery tickets. And the top one? It was the winner!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My phone was dying, but I was able to charge it with the same power bank. Which was a relief, considering I had to call in to claim my winnings, and I imagined I’d be on hold a long time. Only, I wasn’t! I dialed incorrectly and a woman answered. Before I could say “wrong number,” we were chatting and laughing like old friends. In fact, we were in love.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I suggested we should meet, but she began to cry and told me, “If only it were that simple.” Then, she explained her predicament. She was a wealthy heiress. Her family worried her suitors would be after nothing but her inheritance. As such, they would only permit her to be with someone whose wealth amounted to more than hers. I asked her what her net worth was, and she told me. As luck would have it, it was a dollar less than the lottery winnings that were soon to be mine!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Anyway, we’re getting married in a week, and I couldn’t have done it without these power banks with lights on them. Or, maybe I could’ve. But they helped a little bit!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow! Thanks, Terrance. What a charmed life.</p>
<p>Anyway, buy some power banks with lights on them, please.</p>
