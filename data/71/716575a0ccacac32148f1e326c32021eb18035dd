<h2>Preheat oven</h2>
<p>Preheat oven at 175°C.</p>
<h2>Ingredients at room temperature</h2>
<p>Ensure the cream cheese, sour cream, and eggs are at room temperature before starting.</p>
<h2>Mix cream cheese</h2>
<ul>
<li>900g of cream cheese</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix the cream cheese thoroughly.</p>
<h2>Mix sugar</h2>
<ul>
<li>240g of sugar</li>
</ul>
<p>Add half the sugar. Mix in thoroughly. Add second half and mix.</p>
<h2>Mix sour cream, corn flour, and vanilla.</h2>
<ul>
<li>100g sour cream</li>
<li>40g corn flour</li>
<li>1tbsp vanilla bean paste</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the three ingredients and mix well.</p>
<h2>Mix eggs</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>1 egg yolk</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the eggs and mix for 30 seconds.</p>
<h2>Mix by hand</h2>
<p>Finish mixing thoroughly by hand, using a wooden spoon.</p>
<h2>Prepare pan</h2>
<ul>
<li>Springform pan</li>
<li>Parchment paper</li>
</ul>
<p>A springform pan works best here. Wrap its plate with parchment paper and lock it in place.</p>
<h2>Pour mix</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strainer</li>
</ul>
<p>Pour the mix through a strainer and into the prepared pan.</p>
<h2>Rest mix</h2>
<p>Let the mix rest in the pan for 10 minutes to let air bubbles out.</p>
<h2>Bake</h2>
<p>Bake for an 1 hour 10 minutes. Maybe add another 10 minutes (or more) if surface is still pale. Turn the oven off, leave door half open, and let it sit for 20 minutes.</p>
<h2>Cool off</h2>
<p>Take out and let it cool off to room temperature.</p>
<h2>Refrigerate</h2>
<p>Refrigerate for 4 hours (or overnight) before removing the sides of the pan.</p>
<h2>Eat!</h2>
<p>Nom nom. Yum yum.</p>
<h2>Bonus (topping)</h2>
<p>I winged this one and it worked out well. Heated up frozen berries with some honey and used it as topping. The whole combo was pretty tasty.</p>
