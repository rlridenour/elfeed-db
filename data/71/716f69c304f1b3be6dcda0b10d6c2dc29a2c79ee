<p>China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported that the country’s population declined for a fourth consecutive year in 2025, reflecting a sustained demographic shift with global economic implications. Official figures showed births fell to 7.92 million—down from 2024—while deaths increased, deepening concerns about an ageing society and a smaller future workforce. The data arrive despite expanded pro-family incentives and public campaigns aimed at encouraging marriage and childbearing, which several outlets say have not reversed the trend.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/LYWo-GIa-pvKre0Cbe7icvNwPzWXsLfJ5YKIUnrfOsvnQe7d1gE8dT_19TjZHAKmD-1WZoEovWkz-0Aac3RPIHB1fXwAqWfoRWtZdENQleTaxet28w6RQwYSNf_VgKby9oEHEMv7vcw71L9wNiqp5en5Gba5ZKCTLCeLlIfOeQ' alt='' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Marriage indicator: China registered a sharp fall in marriages in 2024—reported as more than 6.1 million couples—often watched as a leading indicator for future births.</li><li>Policy tweaks: China began allowing couples to marry anywhere in the country (not only their place of residence), a procedural change demographers cited as a possible reason for a temporary bump in births.</li><li>UN projection: At the current pace, the United Nations projects China’s population could fall to about 800 million by 2100, highlighting how long-run demographic momentum can persist even after policy changes.</li><li>Retirement response: Beijing has moved to raise the retirement age as part of its effort to manage the fiscal and labor pressures associated with rapid population ageing.</li><li>Peak comparison: The 2025 birth total was reported to be roughly 10 million below the 2016 peak and has dropped by more than half in less than a decade, underscoring the speed of the shift.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>China’s National Bureau of Statistics: Official data show a fourth straight year of population decline alongside record-low births and higher deaths in 2025.
