When the Romans pushed their way north into the German provinces, they built (circa 90 AD)&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saalburg">the Saalburg</a>, a fort that protected the boundary between the Roman Empire and the Germanic tribal territories. At its peak, 2,000 people lived in the fort and the attached village, and it remained active until around 260 AD.</p>
<p>Sometime during the 19th century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saalburg">the Saalburg</a>&nbsp;was rediscovered and excavated, then later fully reconstructed. It’s now&nbsp;a&nbsp;UNESCO World Heritage site and houses&nbsp;the<a href="https://www.saalburgmuseum.de/en/"> Saalburg Museum</a>, which contains many Roman relics, including a 2,000-year-old shoe, apparently found in a local well.</p>

<p>If you think the Italians have mastered the craft of making shoes, well, they don’t have much on their ancestors. According to the site <em>Romans Across Europe</em>, the Romans “were the originators of the entire-foot-encasing shoe.” The site continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was a wide variety of shoes and sandals for men and women. Most were constructed like military&nbsp;<em>caligae</em>, with a one-piece upper nailed between layers of the sole. Many had large open-work areas made by cutting or punching circles, triangles, squares, ovals, etc. in rows or grid-like patterns. Others were more enclosed, having only holes for the laces. Some very dainty women’s and children’s shoes still had thick nailed soles.</p></blockquote>
