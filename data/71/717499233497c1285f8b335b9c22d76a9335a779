<p id="p2">Today, <a href="https://copilot.money/?utm_source=macstories&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_campaign=macstories_121525&amp;utm_term=MACSTORIES" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copilot Money</a> &mdash; the Apple Editor&rsquo;s Choice money app &mdash; is expanding beyond iPhone, iPad, and Mac with the launch of its new web app, available now. This release brings Copilot&rsquo;s beautiful, clean interface and powerful financial insights to any browser, with native-quality performance built right into the web experience. And with seamless syncing across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and now the web, it&rsquo;s easier than ever to get a consistent, clear picture of your money wherever you are.</p>
<p id="p3">Their apps have earned accolades for a reason: they bring all your spending, budgets, investments, and net worth into one organized place, with a thoughtful design that helps you dive into the details without losing the big picture. This is how a modern budgeting app should feel &mdash; calm, intuitive, and built to give you confidence, not anxiety.</p>
<p id="p4">With Copilot Money, every account connects to a single dashboard, transactions are intelligently categorized, and insights surface automatically to help you stay on track without maintaining spreadsheets or jumping between apps. Whether you&rsquo;re planning your month, analyzing trends, or working toward long-term goals, Copilot Money&rsquo;s cross-device experience now makes financial clarity available anywhere you need it.</p>
<p id="p5">To celebrate the web launch, Copilot Money is offering MacStories readers two months free with code MACSTORIES. And for a limited time, when you sign up on their website, you&rsquo;ll also get 26% off your first year.</p>
