<p>Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s last shah, held a news conference in Washington on Friday urging foreign governments to increase pressure on Iran’s clerical leadership amid recent unrest and a security crackdown. He said he believes Iran’s Islamic Republic is nearing collapse and appealed for political, economic and, in some formulations, military pressure to support protesters, including calls to target leaders of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. Several reports also note that President Trump has so far held off on intervening directly despite Pahlavi’s repeated appeals.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/oIkehxHYURdkTT-VqVh1kPw3QIRDUj1QDpYPnWe6-50_LAd2cHFTIbYpLKBYoCMIYvBwKJpNR700McX7pFY22a8NKeP1InwDtwf5onU3BVZEgHYJS9GopSNcqstIGIzrVW8fQVdpxOca4emvfYOzeypVb1Zsqk63fjrXgHaOO6l0IR91p5IT2Dyd9s2pbtGYz9ruC64lfdLTFNMyYdPo_4ViR5u6EZRlgXefyfnY2IdQJvp4jCATC3rBEIigT3RLoszsA6fkuGG9JNKsUPfe' alt='Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah, during recent media appearances.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Claimed leadership role: Pahlavi argued he is “uniquely positioned” to help lead a successor government, a pitch that has prompted questions about the breadth of his support inside Iran.</li><li>Crackdown context: Multiple outlets report that a deadly state crackdown has largely quelled the wave of demonstrations, even as opposition figures continue to call for renewed pressure on Tehran.</li><li>Europe outreach: Pahlavi also appealed specifically to European countries for help, describing the Iranian leadership as on its “last legs” while urging backing for demonstrators.</li><li>Sanctions focus: The BBC report highlights his call to target the Revolutionary Guards’ leadership as part of international action aimed at weakening the state’s coercive apparatus.</li></ul><blockquote>The Islamic republic will fall -- not if, but when, - Reza Pahlavi</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Reza Pahlavi (Iranian opposition figure): He urged the international community to ramp up pressure—political, economic and, in some statements, military—saying the Islamic Republic is close to collapse and that backing protesters could reduce further loss of life.
