<li>Can hold any shape of can</li>
<li>Keeps them cold</li>
<li>Also, you can cap them to avoid spilling</li>
<li>Are they available in Georgia Red: No, but they are available in American red, white, and blue</li>
</ul><h1>Concealer</h1><p>Oh no. You misread the can.</p>
<p>This THC seltzer was not a 3mg-strength variety. It’s 30mgs. And it has totally triggered your sense of paranoia. Not only are you high, but, for some reason, you think that you must conceal your high from all of your friends who definitely know you partake in weed on the regular.</p>
<p>But don’t worry. There’s good news.</p>
<p>You’ve hidden your can of THC seltzer in a CanKeeper. And not any CanKeeper, either. This one came in a 5-pack and looks like an American flag. People at this 4th of of July cookout probably think you’re drinking some sort of domestic pilsner.</p>
<p>So, it should be easy to keep your high under wraps.</p>
<p>All you need to do is act normal. Totally normal.</p>
<p>Okay, here’s your chance. Tim is asking you what you’ve been up to. Just hit him with a super ordinary human response.</p>
<p><em>“I have been up to a variety of things. These and those.”</em></p>
<p>A little awkward, maybe. And you did whisper it, for some reason. But Tim seems to think it’s funny. He’s laughing like it’s a joke. Or is he laughing at you? Or is it a knowing laugh? Like he knows how high you are?</p>
<p>Better get out of here. Maybe excuse yourself to get some food.</p>
<p><em>“Sorry to leave so early in our conversation, but I require sustenance.”</em></p>
<p>Okay, you’re still whispering, and Tim definitely knows you’re high, but just walk away. It’ll be better.</p>
<p>Here you are at the food table. Maybe grab a hot dog. Just do it in a normal way, so you don’t look like a weirdo.</p>
<p>Okay, you’ve literally put a big glop of relish on your plate. And now you’re chopping up a hot dog and a bun? And mixing it together?</p>
<p>Lisa’s asking what you’re doing.</p>
<p><em>“Just making a little salad.”</em></p>
<p>Hmmm, not sure that was the right response. But it’s no problem. She’ll think it’s just something quirky as long as you eat your “salad” like you would any other day. Small, controlled bites, and–</p>
<p>Oh, wow. You just wolfed it down in two huge fork-loads. Lisa is excusing herself. She actually looks a little sick. This isn’t going very well.</p>
<p>You know what? Maybe take another sip of your seltzer.</p>
<p>Oh no, now the high is even stronger. But damn, that seltzer is cold and refreshing, isn’t it? Thanks to your CanKeeper! What a product!</p>
