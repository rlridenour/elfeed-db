<p>It's been roughly 5 months since <a href="http://xenodium.com/#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap">my mu4e email migration</a>. Happy with my choice. <a href="http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html">Mu4e</a> is awesome.</p>
<p>I now have 4 email accounts managed by mu4e, and unfortunately receiving lots of junk mail.</p>
<p>I regularly peek at junk folders for false positives and delete junk email permanently. I've been wanting a quick way to glance at junk mail and easily delete page by page.</p>
<p>Deleting emails page by page is not supported in mu4e by default. <em>Fortunately, this is Emacs and we can change that™.</em></p>
<p>There's a handy package by Roland Walker called <a href="http://github.com/rolandwalker/window-end-visible">window-end-visible</a>. We can use it to select mu4e emails by page and subsequently glue it all together to enable deleting emails by page.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(require 'mu4e)
(require 'window-end-visible)

(defun ar/mu4e-delete-page ()
  (interactive)
  (set-mark (window-start))
  (goto-char (window-end-visible))
  (activate-mark)
  (mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash)
  (mu4e-mark-execute-all t)
  (deactivate-mark)
  (goto-char (window-start)))
</code></pre>
<p>I'm a <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a> fan, so I use it to bind the &quot;v&quot; key to delete <em>visible emails (by page</em>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(use-package mu4e
  :bind (:map mu4e-headers-mode-map
         (&quot;v&quot; . ar/mu4e-delete-page))
</code></pre>
