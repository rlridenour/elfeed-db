<p>At least 50 children who were abducted during a mass kidnapping at St. Mary’s Catholic co-educational boarding school in Niger state, central Nigeria, have escaped from their captors and have been reunited with their parents, church officials and Christian leaders said on Sunday. The raid on Friday targeted more than 300 pupils and staff aged roughly 8 to 18, making it one of the largest school abductions Nigeria has seen in recent years amid a wider surge of attacks by armed groups on schools and churches. Religious leaders say around 253 children and 12 staff remain in captivity, while Nigerian authorities have not yet confirmed the exact number still missing. In a separate incident linked to the same wave of violence, the government announced that security forces rescued 38 worshippers kidnapped from a church service in Kwara state after gunmen killed at least two people there earlier in the week. The kidnappings have prompted the federal government to temporarily close all schools in the affected region and have intensified international concern about Nigeria’s ability to protect civilians from armed gangs.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Ki-pDPv2E0uMeG8zC-TkapCHX3CeIYmHMWOgBQ0ZvaDXiwN9nM7B2Ed4GyjyOgUB59ItOTdt2UnzlXyZ1HElv_TuC6Y9mk-Do0-yOQ-MGPlt' alt='Relatives and community members gather near St. Mary’s Catholic school in Niger state after news that dozens of abducted children have escaped.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>School shutdowns: While authorities gather more information about the abduction, the Nigerian government has ordered all schools in the region around St. Mary’s Catholic school to close as a precautionary security measure.</li><li>Scale of abduction: Christian leaders report that 303 children and 12 teachers were taken from St. Mary’s, a figure that represents close to half of the school’s student body of over 600.</li><li>Other recent attacks: The school raid followed an earlier kidnapping of 25 girls from a secondary school in neighboring Kebbi state and an armed attack on a church in Kwara state during a live-streamed service.</li><li>Government rescue efforts: Nigeria’s president stated on social media that 51 missing St. Mary’s students have been recovered and vowed that he &quot;will not relent&quot; in efforts to secure the country.</li><li>US policy pressure: The incidents have added pressure on Nigeria’s government following President Trump’s threat of possible US military action over what he described as persecution of Christians in the country.</li></ul><blockquote>We have received some good news as fifty (St Mary’s) pupils escaped and have reunited with their parents. - Christian Association of Nigeria statement</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Christian Association of Nigeria: The Christian Association of Nigeria welcomed the escape of 50 St. Mary’s pupils but stressed that hundreds of children and staff are still being held and called for their immediate, safe release.
