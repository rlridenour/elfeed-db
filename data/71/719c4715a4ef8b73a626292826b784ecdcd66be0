Now that I finally have a git forge set up, with CI/CD, I finally have the environment I need to get off Github. There were some hiccups, but Forgejo is quite nice, and the only real complaint I have is that <code>ssh</code> authentication only works via IPv6, which I don't always have access to. I've made it as available over IPv4 as I can; this is nothing against Foregjo, it's a consequence of being forced onto Starlink.

As for why I wanted to move off Github in the first place, well, the only reason I was using it to begin with was for visibility, but that's very quickly turned into a double-edged sword. I don't want my code used by Microsoft for AI training. It's as simple as that.

I'm not exactly so big in the open source space - my biggest repository is sitting at 52 stars, which is a great ego boost but hardly an actual reach - so I'm not saying that this big migration will impact anyone. Surely the two people using my Godot addons will manage fine with downloading the source over HTTPS. This is more about the principle of it - I don't work for free, and I don't want this information being consumed willy-nilly for profit by some opaque hivemind entity.

Most of the fun projects I've worked on were never on Github, they still sit somewhere on Bitbucket (or a backup harddrive somehwere) and I never bothered to migrate them. Stuff will be moved over incrementally, and I'm including that.

As for reach issues, well, I never really bothered to advertise myself anywhere except Godot's addon repositories, so if that's something I really start feeling a need for I'll go hop on a mailing list or make a Reddit account.
