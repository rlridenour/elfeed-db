The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models include an Accessibility setting to disable pulse width modulation (PWM), according to information found in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> release candidate.<br/>

There will be a toggle located in the Display and Text Size section of the Accessibility settings on the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;. Users will be able to turn PWM on, or turn it off. A description:<br/>
<blockquote>Disables pulse width modulation to provide a different way to dim the OLED display, which can create a smoother display output at low brightness levels. Disabling PWM may affect low brightness display performance under certain conditions.</blockquote><br/>
It is possible that the PWM toggle will be available on all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models, but we can only confirm that it's an option on the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>

Pulse width modulation is used for adjusting the brightness of a display. PWM is designed to quickly switch LED or OLED pixels on or off to control the brightness that people perceive. Some users are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PWM_Sensitive/">bothered by PWM</a> and can see a flickering at lower brightness levels.<br/>
<br/>
Affected users often complain of eye strain, headaches, and other symptoms, but it is a technology that display makers use because it is energy efficient. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and perhaps other &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models could provide those who are bothered by PWM with a fix.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-pro-pwm-toggle/">iPhone 17 Pro Has Toggle to Disable Screen Flickering (PWM)</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-has-toggle-to-disable-screen-flickering-pwm.2465081/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
