The one who had already <br></br>
shed all the privileges of God, <br></br>
also shed his outer robe. <br></br>
Wrapping himself in a simple towel, <br></br>
he lovingly washed the disciples’ feet <br></br>
with his calloused hands. <br></br> <br></br>
Teach us, Lord, to shed <br></br>
our own trappings of power and prestige, <br></br>
as we reach out to those rejected by the world; <br></br>
and may we always have the grace to accept <br></br>
the things that you have had the grace to offer. <br></br> <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
