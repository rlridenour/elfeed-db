<p>President Trump announced sanctions that blacklist Russia’s two largest oil firms, Rosneft and Lukoil, and dozens of their subsidiaries as part of a push to pressure Moscow to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine; the announcement came as European partners moved to add new energy restrictions . U.S. secondary sanctions threaten trading partners that continue working with the sanctioned firms, a step intended to choke revenue flowing to Russia’s war effort and to persuade buyers to stop purchases . Russian President Vladimir Putin described the measures as “unfriendly” and “serious” but said they would not make Russia stop the war, signalling a likely persistence of the standoff even as some customers reportedly scale back imports . Financial markets and energy analysts warned the moves could tighten global oil supplies and lift prices in the near term .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/KhK3u094OTa-u60JJG3UUq-1qyQ3_MNqJC9J5_oBK-Brw01LgV7FbsHC1NcnpFQb252x1AKFBN25pxFKZUNMOrdxz4rivSMr-0PvrL8q5wf4f0COBOcZ-oXxLQ25oF8an5d9-DuxGNaRk5GV3YswH-bLLZxgjpQZGslJ8emYftjlw8zHDlE9140RZX4n0ugQwtq87gUOx4-zb3bEjfIRrS9unMT_SZoKvur7vO7X0vSx5Z1zOwyxsj30' alt='Vladimir Putin says Donald Trump&#x27;s new oil sanctions are &quot;unfriendly&quot;.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Subsidiaries targeted: The U.S. measures extend beyond parents to nearly three dozen subsidiaries, a move designed to broaden the sanctions&#x27; reach into trading and shipping networks</li><li>Secondary sanctions timeline: Washington&#x27;s approach includes a one‑month wind‑down window for partners doing business with sanctioned entities, pressuring foreign buyers to cut ties quickly</li><li>Market reaction: Energy markets reacted to the announcement with analysts warning of upward pressure on oil prices because the sanctioned firms account for a large share of Russia&#x27;s export capacity</li><li>EU measures: The EU moved in parallel, adding Russia restrictions — including a phased ban on liquefied natural gas and the inclusion of two Chinese refiners on its sanctions list — to tighten the squeeze on Kremlin revenues</li></ul><blockquote>This is a significant step, - Kimberly Donovan</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Russia (Vladimir Putin): Putin called the new U.S. measures &#x27;unfriendly&#x27; and &#x27;serious&#x27; but said they would not force Russia to stop the war and that Russia &#x27;will never bow to the US&#x27;, framing the sanctions as something Moscow can weather .
