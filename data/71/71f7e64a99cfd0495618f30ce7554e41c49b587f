iOS 26 is gaining two new Wi-Fi features, including Captive Assist and Wi-Fi Aware.<br/>

<em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a> discovered a reference to Captive Assist within the code for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-26-developer-beta-iphone/">first iOS 26 developer beta</a>, but Apple has yet to enable the feature. It should be available by the time the software update is released later this year.<br/>
<br/>
In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter last month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple was working on a feature that would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/ios-19-sync-captive-wi-fi-data-between-devices/">sync captive Wi-Fi network sign-in information</a> across the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This means that if you are asked to fill out a web form on one Apple device before connecting to a public Wi-Fi network at a hotel, airport, or coffee shop, that information would automatically be shared with your other Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, this Captive Assist feature will make connecting to public Wi-Fi networks more convenient across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe.<br/>
<br/>
Next, iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 add support for Wi-Fi Aware, which is essentially the industry-standard equivalent of the Apple Wireless Direct Link technology behind AirDrop and AirPlay. Apple is making a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WiFiAware">Wi-Fi Aware framework</a> available to developers, allowing for App Store apps to offer peer-to-peer connections between Wi-Fi devices, without an internet connection or access point. Wi-Fi Aware <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/228/">will allow for</a> third-party apps to offer new built-in features for high-speed file transfers, media streaming, screen sharing, and more.<br/>

Apple was <a href="https://www.ditto.com/blog/cross-platform-p2p-wi-fi-how-the-eu-killed-awdl">required to support Wi-Fi Aware</a> on the iPhone and iPad in the EU, under the terms of the Digital Markets Act. In fact, the European Commission specifically stated that iOS and iPadOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/ios-19-ios-20-deadlines-for-eu-changes/">must allow for AirDrop and AirPlay alternatives</a> by the end of next year. As noted <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/20/ios-26-to-let-third-party-apps-build-their-own-airdrop-alternative/">by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>, the Wi-Fi Aware framework seems to satisfy those requirements. Apple has actually gone a step further by making the Wi-Fi Aware framework available worldwide.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the following devices support the Wi-Fi Aware framework:<ul><br/>
  <li>iPhone 12 and later</li><br/>
  <li>iPad (10th generation) and later</li><br/>
  <li>iPad mini (6th generation) and later</li><br/>
  <li>iPad Air (4th generation) and later</li><br/>
  <li>iPad Pro 11-inch (3rd generation) and later</li><br/>
  <li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch (5th generation) and later</li><br/>
