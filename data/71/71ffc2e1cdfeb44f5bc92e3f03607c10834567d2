<p>A new tranche of U.S. Justice Department records tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has renewed scrutiny of his links to prominent figures abroad, including in Europe and Russia. Several outlets described the release as massive—running into millions of files—with Al Jazeera putting it at three million and publishing a visual guide to help readers understand what the documents do and do not show. In the UK, Buckingham Palace said King Charles is profoundly concerned by fresh reporting about his brother, former Prince Andrew, and that the royal household would support police if asked as authorities assess the matter. Reports said the claims center on emails suggesting Andrew forwarded official material to Epstein after Epstein’s earlier conviction for child sex crimes. In the U.S., reporting summarized by multiple outlets said FBI reviews found ample evidence that Epstein sexually abused underage girls, but no evidence he ran a broader sex-trafficking ring for powerful men—pushing back on widely circulated conspiracy claims. At the same time, other coverage said newly released emails and contacts underscore how wide Epstein’s international network was, raising more questions about influence, facilitation, and accountability even when criminal charges did not follow for many people around him.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ZRjfda0GvqY5tVpdiz10AVPdp2j57vDcHVAthOUvr8Td1mjzwaC8JSy5XrWXJL983iv9c_5MayTyH51BaeapwAtABlKRRrTa-qR1i7pY7jUGMIAnIMa9Q57UL-mCcLz7exRpZyExiYUH0Fp9yx37fEHgJUNnK3nIxnLjx7a8tOcxwmjMzsY2JigxQCd0cLLUa8E9Dl2jpd9YbzOdsQR7SJ1f3VnlEoQ1IVPyuKNXzh9-nm2YskSI0ktc5k7DleJqJ9le' alt='Britain’s King Charles pictured amid reporting on possible cooperation with police reviewing allegations tied to the Epstein files.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>UK royal fallout: DW said the renewed focus on Andrew risks overshadowing Prince William’s visit to Saudi Arabia.</li><li>Russia links: Le Monde said emails show Epstein acted as a facilitator for Kremlin insiders between 2011 and 2019, including help with real estate transactions and offshore financial arrangements.</li><li>UK allegation detail: The Hindu, citing the BBC, said the emails include a November 2010 message that forwards a report prepared by Andrew’s then special assistant Amit Patel connected to official trade visits.</li><li>Spy allegation: Novara Media said an FBI report includes a confidential-informant claim that the informant had become “convinced” Epstein was employed by Israel’s Mossad, presenting it as an allegation in released materials rather than an official finding.</li><li>Europe-wide ties: The Straits Times said the release highlights Epstein’s ties to European figures across business, academia, government, and royalty.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Buckingham Palace: The palace said the King is profoundly concerned by the allegations and that the royal household stands ready to support police if they ask.
