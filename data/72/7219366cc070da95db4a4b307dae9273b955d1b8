Apple has an upcoming promotion that gives users up to two months of free Apple Music when they add funds to their Apple Account balance, according to code found by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris.<br/>

The offer will provide two months of free Apple Music for new subscribers and one month for qualified returning subscribers when adding &#36;25 or more to an Apple Account balance. Users receive a bonus code immediately after adding the required amount.<br/>
<br/>
The promotion is set to run through March 16, 2026, and is available only in the United States for users 13 and older. Gift card purchases from third-party retailers and Apple stores are excluded from the offer.<br/>
<br/>
After the free period ends, Apple Music automatically renews at &#36;10.99 per month unless canceled. Users can manage their subscription through the Apple Account section at the top of iPhone's Settings app menu (then tap Payment & Shipping ➝ Add Money to Apple Account). To avoid being charged, users must cancel at least one day before renewal.<br/>
<br/>
The offer, which has yet to go live, will be limited to one per Apple Account and cannot be combined with other Apple Music promotions.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pay-promo/">Apple Pay Promo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/22/apple-music-free-trial-apple-account-balance/">Add &#36;25 to Apple Account Balance, Get 2 Months Free Apple Music</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/add-25-to-apple-account-balance-get-2-months-free-apple-music.2463817/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
