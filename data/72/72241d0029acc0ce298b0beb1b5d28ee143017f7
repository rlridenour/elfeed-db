<br/>
<ul><li><strong>New Firmware:</strong> 101.0 (Version) / 8B32 (Build)</li><br/>
<li><strong>Previous Firmware:</strong> 99.0 (Version) / 8B25 (Build)</li></ul>Apple does not share release notes for iPhone Air MagSafe Battery firmware updates, so it is unclear what is new. However, it would be reasonable to assume the update includes performance and stability improvements, and/or bug fixes.<br/>

iPhone Air MagSafe Battery firmware updates automatically install in the background over time, while the accessory is charged and actively being used.<br/>
