<p>US immigration enforcement in the Minneapolis area drew fresh scrutiny after school officials and a family lawyer said federal agents detained a five-year-old boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, during an operation that also took his father into custody, with the child later ending up in federal custody in Texas. The Columbia Heights school superintendent said agents effectively used the child “as bait,” while the Department of Homeland Security said officers did not target the child and stayed with him for safety after the father ran. Vice President J.D. Vance visited Minneapolis amid rising tensions over the broader enforcement push, urging residents to stop opposing immigration enforcement even as local outrage has grown.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/CAr-vJXg8SiWpjMxRoTsHDutGiogEw-T0rdDqCnw-os5180j4m757qVcGT2FahyR9ljCJoEosRMYTq6Ijmi-ZRc7LSTkNgqx4AZSTcxw' alt='Security personnel stand next to a five-year-old boy who was detained in Minneapolis.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Disputed accounts: School officials said agents took the boy from a running car in the family’s driveway after preschool pickup, while DHS said the father fled, leaving the child behind and prompting an officer to remain with him for safety.</li><li>Wider detentions: Columbia Heights Public Schools said this is the fourth student from the district detained by immigration officers in recent weeks, and it reported a separate incident where a 17-year-old student was taken by armed, masked agents while heading to school.</li><li>Vance visit: Vance met Minneapolis-area leaders, said he heard the “terrible story,” and later emphasized he was told the child was detained rather than arrested, while also backing ICE’s work publicly.</li><li>Federal posture: Reporting described a large-scale enforcement operation in Minneapolis, with 3,000 officers deployed as part of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, which the president has framed as targeting violent criminals.</li><li>Local unrest: Minneapolis has seen weeks of outcry over ICE tactics, and tensions rose further after an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old US citizen and mother of three, earlier in January, according to coverage of Vance’s trip.</li></ul><blockquote>You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal. - Zena Stenvik</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Columbia Heights Public Schools: District leaders say agents effectively used the child to draw out and apprehend his father and that multiple students from the district have been detained in recent weeks.
