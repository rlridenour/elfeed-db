<p id="p2">Today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/john-giannandrea-to-retire-from-apple/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple announced</a> the retirement of John Giannandrea, the company&rsquo;s senior vice president for Machine Learning and AI Strategy. Giannandrea will remain at Apple as an advisor until next spring.</p>
<p id="p3">News of Giannandrea&rsquo;s retirement was paired with an announcement that Apple has hired Amar Subramanya as vice president of AI. Subramanya, who worked at Microsoft <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/22/microsoft-google-deepmind-ai-talent.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">since this past summer</a>, previously worked at Google for 16 years on projects including the company&rsquo;s Gemini Assistant. Subramanya will take the lead on Apple Foundation Models, ML research, and AI Safety and Evaluation, while other areas of Giannandrea&rsquo;s work will be inherited by Sabih Khan and Eddy Cue.</p>
<p id="p4"><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/john-giannandrea-to-retire-from-apple/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple CEO Tim Cook thanked Giannandrea</a> for his tenure at the company:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  We are thankful for the role John played in building and advancing our AI work, helping Apple continue to innovate and enrich the lives of our users. AI has long been central to Apple&rsquo;s strategy, and we are pleased to welcome Amar to Craig&rsquo;s leadership team and to bring his extraordinary AI expertise to Apple. In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar&rsquo;s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">Given the troubled history of Apple&rsquo;s AI efforts, the retirement of Giannandrea isn&rsquo;t surprising. It will be interesting to see if Subramanya settles into his new role given the frequency with which top AI talent tends to turn over in the tech industry.</p>
