<p id="p2">Devin Davies, the developer of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crouton-recipe-manager/id1461650987" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crouton</a> whom <a href="https://appstories.net/posts/wwdc-2024-the-appstories-interviews-with-ada-and-swift-student-challenge-distinguished-winners" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federico and I interviewed</a> after he won an Apple Design Award in 2024, has released a new app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cassette-home-video-player/id6475023019?at=1001l3bhP&amp;ct=app" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cassette</a>. It&rsquo;s an app for browsing videos from the photo library on your iPhone or iPad that has a fun design twist.</p>
<p id="p3">Leaning heavily into the nostalgia of watching old videos of friends and family, Cassette sorts your videos using a VCR metaphor. Videos are organized by year and by collection, with video cassette art and a label identifying each. At the top of the screen is an old CRT TV with a built-in VCR. Tap a year or collection, and it loads into the TV with satisfying haptic feedback on the iPhone.</p>

<p id="p5">Tap the virtual TV, and the video goes full-screen with date and location data that&rsquo;s reminiscent of a VCR&rsquo;s UI. While watching videos, the app offers standard playback controls along with a shuffle button, buttons to share and favorite videos, and an eject button to return to your video collections.</p>
<p id="p6">Videos cycle from one to the next and then loop back to the beginning, where playback continues. You can also swipe through videos TikTok-style, skipping over any you don&rsquo;t want to watch. Finally, there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;Take Me Somewhere&rsquo; button at the bottom that drops you at a random location in your video collection, eliminating the need to pick something yourself.</p>
<p id="p7">Most of the functionality found in Cassette is available in other video players, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it any less fun or delightful. What sets the app apart is its focus on design and framing. From the drop, Cassette is designed to transport you to the past with its VCR-inspired UI and singular focus on videos, transforming into a sort of handheld time machine.</p>

Certain features are only available via a $0.99/month or $5.99/year subscription or a $7.99 one-time payment.</p>
