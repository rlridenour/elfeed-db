<h2 id="grila">Grila</h2>
<p><a href="https://lowtechguys.com/grila" target="_blank">Grila - Calendar for keyboard addicts</a></p>
<p>This is a free application which does a great job of letting you view your reminders and calendars. It is a smart, little menu bar application which is beautiful to look at and useful to have around.</p>
<p>Grila doesn’t let you edit any of your content from the calendars or your reminders. That is deliberate. This is good for display and not much else.</p>
<h2 id="reminders-menubar">Reminders MenuBar</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DamascenoRafael/reminders-menubar" target="_blank">DamascenoRafael/reminders-menubar: Simple macOS menu bar application to view and interact with reminders. Developed with SwiftUI and using Apple Reminders as a source.</a></p>
<p>A menu bar application which lets you view and add/edit your reminders. It is an addition to the stock macOS Reminders app and I find it super useful.</p>
<p>The developer lists the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>All interactions through the macOS menu bar</li>
<li>Keep everything in sync with Apple Reminders</li>
<li>Create new reminders in your chosen list</li>
<li>Set a reminder’s due date using natural language</li>
<li>Mark reminders as completed / uncompleted</li>
<li>Edit reminders, Remove reminders or Move reminders between lists</li>
<li>View a list of upcoming reminders</li>
<li>Filter reminders through lists or through completed status</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an application which should have been a part of Reminders.</p>
<h2 id="caffeinemate">CaffeineMate</h2>
<p><a href="https://eddmann.com/CaffeineMate/" target="_blank">CaffeineMate - Keep Your Mac Awake Free Menu Bar App for macOS</a></p>
<p>CaffeineMate is a menu bar application which prevents your Mac from sleeping. You can choose the amount of time you want your Mac to be awake, and whether you want the display to be able to go to sleep or stay awake. Does one thing and does it well.</p>
<h2 id="prio.space">Prio.Space</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AnoyRC/priospace?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">prio.space All-in-one Productivity App</a></p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prio-space/id6752712865" target="_blank">App Store link</a></p>
<p>I have no need for this application but it is an option in a category which attracts attention. This is a free, productivity application which is full-featured and beautiful.</p>
<p>Try it out. You might like it.</p>
