Álvaro Ramírez and Vaarnan Drolia have introduced a really interesting app. At least I guess you would call it an app. It&rsquo;s actually just a Web page that lets you <a href="https://xenodium.com/introducing-kitty-cards">build your own custom Apple Wallet cards</a>. It&rsquo;s easy to use. You simply bring up the Web page, click on and fill in the fields you need on the sample card—including scanning for a bar code—and click on the &ldquo;Add to Apple Wallet&rdquo; button.

If you&rsquo;re an Apple Wallet user, you may like this app. You can take any physical card with a bar code and add it to your Apple Wallet. Then you have one less card to carry around.</p>
