<p>Michael Tsai, back on September 30, compiled a roundup of links regarding Electron apps causing systemwide lag on MacOS 26 Tahoe. The reason, seemingly, is that the Electron framework <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/48311#issuecomment-3332181420">was overriding a private AppKit API</a>. Of course.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/tkafka/e3eb63a5ec448e9be6701bfd1f1b1e58">Tomas Kafka wrote a shell script</a> to find un-updated Electron apps on your system. Craig Hockenberry took Kafka’s shell script and <a href="https://furbo.org/2025/10/06/tahoe-electron-detector/">turned it into an easy-to-use AppleScript application</a>.</p>

<p>So, yes, Theo Browne, “software dev nerd”, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdmfFmwsGDo&amp;t=435s">Electron really is “that bad”</a>. It’s actually, if anything, worse.</p>
