Apple hasn't updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> since 2022, and the earbuds are due for a refresh. We're counting on a new model this year, and we've seen <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/ios-26-code-airpods-pro-3/">several hints of new AirPods</a> tucked away in Apple's code. Rumors suggest that Apple has some exciting new features planned that will make it worthwhile to upgrade to the latest model.<br/>

 	<li><strong>Health Features</strong> - Earlier this year, Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2 with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-announced/">heart rate monitoring</a>, and that functionality is expected for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> too. Temperature sensing is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/airpods-pro-3-heart-rate-feature-rumor/">also a possibility</a>. The Apple Watch can detect skin temperature, but that's not accurate for fevers. In-ear temperature readings would provide more useful data.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Audio Quality Upgrade</strong> - Apple is upgrading the H-series chip that's in the AirPods, which is likely to bring improved audio quality. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 support Lossless Audio when paired with Vision Pro thanks to a proprietary wireless audio protocol, and Apple could expand that to other devices. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; could adopt Bluetooth 5.4 for better audio latency.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Better Active Noise Cancellation</strong> - The H3 chip will allow for even faster on-device processing for improved Active Noise Cancellation and better Adaptive Audio. The H2 chip in the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 actively reduces louder, intermittent noise at 48,000 times per second to cut down on environmental noise exposure, and an upgraded H-series chip could do even better. </li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Refreshed Design</strong> - Apple is going to update the design of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> got a slimmed down case, a hidden capacitive pairing button, and a concealed LED, so we could see those same changes with the next &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. The earbuds could get a design overhaul too, and upgrade possibilities include a smaller in-ear piece and a shorter stem.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Updated Tracking</strong> - The &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; are likely to get Apple's second-generation Ultra Wide Band (UWB) chip for more precise tracking using the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> app.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
Live Translation was a feature rumored for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;, but as it turns out, that's functionality that Apple brought to all AirPods models that are connected to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that supports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>. Live Translation also works on Apple Intelligence-compatible Macs and iPads.<br/>

We're expecting to see the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; later this year, perhaps at Apple's September event where the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models will be unveiled.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/27/airpods-pro-3-five-features/">Five Features Coming to AirPods Pro 3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/five-features-coming-to-airpods-pro-3.2459800/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
