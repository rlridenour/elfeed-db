<p>Demetri Martin <a href="https://gauss.math.yale.edu/fractals/Panorama/Literature/Martin/MartinPalindrome.html">composed this palindromic poem</a> as part of a project for a fractal geometry class at Yale in spring 1993. The first two and last two lines are palindromes, the middle line (&#8220;Be still if I fill its ebb&#8221;) minus its last letter is a palindrome, and the entire poem is a palindrome:</p>
<p>Dammit I&#8217;m mad<br />
Evil is a deed as I live.<br />
God, am I reviled?<br />
I rise, my bed on a sun, I melt.<br />
To be not one man emanating is sad. I piss.<br />
Alas it is so late. Who stops to help? Man, it is hot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in it.<br />
I tell.<br />
I am not a devil.<br />
I level &#8220;Mad Dog&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ah, say burning is as a deified gulp<br />
in my halo of a mired rum tin.<br />
I erase many men. Oh, to be man, a sin.<br />
Is evil in a clam? In a trap?<br />
No. It is open.<br />
On it I was stuck.</p>
<p>Rats peed on hope.<br />
Elsewhere dips a web.<br />
Be still if I fill its ebb.<br />
Ew, a spider &#8230; eh?<br />
We sleep.</p>
<p>Oh no!<br />
Deep, stark cuts saw it in one position.<br />
Part animal, can I live? Sin is a name.<br />
Both, one &#8230; my names are in it. Murder?<br />
I&#8217;m a fool. A hymn I plug,<br />
Deified as a sign in ruby ash &#8211; a Goddam level I lived at.</p>
<p>On mail let it in. I&#8217;m it.<br />
Oh, sit in ample hot spots.<br />
Oh, wet!<br />
A loss it is alas (sip). I&#8217;d assign it a name.<br />
Name not one bottle minus an ode by me:<br />
&#8220;Sir, I deliver. I&#8217;m a dog.&#8221;<br />
Evil is a deed as I live.<br />
Dammit I&#8217;m mad.</p>
