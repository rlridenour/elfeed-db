Marcin Borkowski (mbork) has an <a href="https://mbork.pl/2025-09-15_Entering_dates_in_Emacs_Calc">interesting post on entering dates in Calc mode</a>. The short version is that he often enters dates in Calc but it&rsquo;s a painful exercise. He&rsquo;d much rather enter them the same way you do in Org mode, which is intuitive and flexible. That flexibility comes at the cost of being complicated but that&rsquo;s mostly because there are so many easy ways to specify a date.

Naturally, mbork wanted to be able to enter Calc dates in the user friendly Org mode way. That turns out to be surprisingly easy. After the boilerplate it&rsquo;s just a couple of lines of code plus another line to bind a key sequence to the function in the Calc key map. Read mbork&rsquo;s post to see what I mean about easy.

What struck me most about the post was his mention of <code>org-read-date</code>, which Org uses to read dates. It&rsquo;s incredibly flexible and, as mbork shows, usable in non-Org contexts. Take a look at the doc string for <code>org-read-date</code> to see what I mean. Even though I spend a huge amount of time in Org mode and enter a lot of date/time stamps and even though I&rsquo;ve read the documentation on entering dates in Org, I didn&rsquo;t remember how powerful the function is. Take a look at the doc string to see all the ways you can specify dates.

This is just another example of Emacs&rsquo; extensibility. Mbork had a problem and was able to solve it by gluing together a couple of existing Emacs functions that nominally had nothing to do with each other.</p>
