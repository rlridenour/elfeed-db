<p id="p2">Almost three years ago, Apple offered a sneak peek at an elaborate new version of CarPlay that spread beyond the rectangle of most car infotainment systems to occupy the instrument cluster space in front of front seat passengers. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-provides-a-sneak-peek-at-the-future-of-carplay/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As I said at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  It will be interesting to see how widespread the adoption of the features Apple demoed will be. The company listed 14 automakers like Land Rover, Mercedes, Porsche, Nissan, Volvo, Honda, and Ford that they are working with, but it remains to be seen which models will adopt the new CarPlay and how quickly.

<p id="p6">The difference between standard CarPlay and the Ultra flavor is that the new version takes over a driver&rsquo;s entire dashboard and extends beyond traditional CarPlay features to vehicle-specific data and controls. <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/carplay-ultra-the-next-generation-of-carplay-begins-rolling-out-today/?1747310361" rel="noopener noreferrer">As Apple describes it</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote7"><p>
  CarPlay Ultra provides content for all the driver&rsquo;s screens, including the instrument cluster, with dynamic and beautiful options for the speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, and more, bringing a consistent look and feel to the entire driving experience. Drivers can choose to show information from their iPhone, like maps and media, along with information that comes from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure, right in the instrument cluster.</p>
<p>  Drivers can also use onscreen controls, physical buttons, or Siri to manage both standard vehicle functions like the car&rsquo;s radio and climate, as well as advanced, vehicle-specific features and controls like audio system configurations or performance settings, right from CarPlay, giving them a more fluid and seamless experience. CarPlay Ultra also introduces widgets powered by iPhone that perfectly fit the car&rsquo;s screen or gauge cluster to provide information at a glance.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p8">Although CarPlay Ultra looks great, one car maker is a far cry from the 14 automakers listed on a slide at WWDC in 2022. That&rsquo;s not surprising given pushback from automakers like GM, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23664814/gm-ev-restrict-apple-carplay-android-auto-google" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced in 2023</a> that it was ending CarPlay and Android Auto support for its EVs, and resistance from the likes of Tesla and Rivian to add CarPlay in the first place. However, Apple clearly oversold what would become CarPlay Ultra in 2022 in a way that in hindsight now feels a lot like Apple Intelligence&rsquo;s enhanced Siri demo at last summer&rsquo;s WWDC.</p>
<p id="p9">Still, I&rsquo;m glad to see CarPlay Ultra emerge from the labs, even if it&rsquo;s in a car that few people can afford. Auto tech inevitably trickles down to ordinary cars, and I&rsquo;m sure CarPlay Ultra will, too, although I expect it will be quite a while until then.</p>
