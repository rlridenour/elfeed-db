<p>London doctor Thomas Ellerby had strong feelings about the disposal of his remains &#8212; in his will of February 1827 he threatens to haunt his doctors if they don&#8217;t follow his instructions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I bequeath my heart to Mr. W., anatomist; my lungs to Mr. R.; and my brains to Mr. F., in order that they may preserve them from decomposition; and I declare that if these gentlemen shall fail faithfully to execute these my last wishes in this respect I will come &#8212; if it should be by any means possible &#8212; and torment them until they shall comply.
</p></blockquote>
