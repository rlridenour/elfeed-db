<p>In his 1986 commonplace book <a href="https://archive.org/details/hodgepodgecommon00brya/page/278/mode/2up"><em>Hodgepodge</em></a>, J. Bryan lists this as one of his favorite typographical errors:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8216;Carolyn B&#8212;-, who spoke on &#8216;Looking Ahead,&#8217; said that the three qualities necessary for success are faith, determination and Charles McFee.
</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t classify it or explain it at all. I can only quote it.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t been able to find the original source.</p>
