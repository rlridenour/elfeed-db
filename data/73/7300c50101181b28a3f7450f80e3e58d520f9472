Apple may launch the AirPods Pro 3 in 2026, according to analyst Jeff Pu of GF Securities Hong Kong, contradicting earlier predictions of a much sooner release.<br/>

Pu's Apple product timeline (via <a href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1934164078702076095">@jukanlosreve</a>) comes as a bit of a surprise. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said in February that new AirPods with heart rate monitoring were "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/airpods-with-heart-rate-monitoring-months-away/">months away,</a>" suggesting a late 2025 launch at the earliest. Code references to AirPods Pro 3 were also recently <a href="https://x.com/stevemoser">unearthed</a> in the iOS 26 beta by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser.<br/>
<br/>
That said, in a recent Ming-Chi Kuo report, the analyst said AirPods <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/kuo-lighter-version-airpods-max-2027/">may not see significant updates until 2026</a>, when he expects IR camera-equipped AirPods to enter mass production. However, it was not clear if Kuo was writing about the standard non-Pro AirPods, and the analyst did not respond to requests for clarification.<br/>
<br/>
Historically, Apple has launched significant AirPods updates alongside new iPhones, so a September event – likely shared with the upcoming ‌iPhone‌ 17 series – was thought to be the most plausible window. A 2026 release would mark four years since the AirPods Pro 2 debuted in September 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Pu's product roadmap shows Apple focusing on other hardware in 2025. The analyst expects the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 to arrive this year, which is no real surprise. More notably, he predicts that Apple will also release its rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/apple-home-hub-still-months-away/">HomePad</a> tablet this year – though he offered no more specific date. <br/>
<br/>
For 2026, Pu forecasts the AirPods Pro 3 launching alongside the Apple Watch Series 12 and a refreshed Vision Pro. Looking further into 2027 and beyond, he anticipates blood monitoring capabilities coming to Apple Watch and the debut of "Vision Air" and smart glasses.<br/>
<br/>
The AirPods Pro 3 are expected to feature significantly improved active noise cancellation and heart rate monitoring, similar to the recently announced Powerbeats Pro 2. Apple last updated the AirPods Pro line with a USB-C charging case in September 2023.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/16/airpods-pro-3-not-launching-until-next-year/">AirPods Pro 3 Not Launching Until Next Year, Claims Analyst</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-3-not-launching-until-next-year-claims-analyst.2459103/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
