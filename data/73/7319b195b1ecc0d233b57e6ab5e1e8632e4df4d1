We've been focusing on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/21/apple-black-friday-available-now/">deals on physical products</a> over the past few weeks, but Black Friday is also a great time of year to purchase a streaming membership. Some of the biggest services have great discounts for new and select returning members this week, including Apple TV, Disney+, Hulu, Paramount+, Peacock, and more.<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/apple-tv-holiday.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028038" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple is offering an <a href="https://tv.apple.com/offer/tvs.sbd.4000?itscg=10000&itsct=atv-apl-tv-op-learn_more-BF-112125">Apple TV promotion for new and returning subscribers</a> for Black Friday this year. Eligible customers can get six months of Apple TV for just &#36;5.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://tv.apple.com/offer/tvs.sbd.4000?itscg=10000&itsct=atv-apl-tv-op-learn_more-BF-112125"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">OVER 50% OFF</div>Apple TV for &#36;5.99/Month</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
After the six-month period, the subscription price will increase to &#36;12.99, which is the regular price for the Apple TV service.<br/>
<br/>
At &#36;5.99 per month, Apple is discounting Apple TV by over 50 percent. The deal will be available through December 1 <a href="https://tv.apple.com/offer/tvs.sbd.4000?itscg=10000&itsct=atv-apl-tv-op-learn_more-BF-112125">on the Apple TV website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Existing subscribers are not eligible for the discount, nor are customers who have subscriptions billed through a third-party service.<br/>
<br/>
It's also worth noting that you can get a <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/?plan-picker-category=bundles#ib-section-section-10">bundle of Apple TV and Peacock Premium/Premium Plus</a> at a discounted rate this season.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Disney+ and Hulu</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/disney-new-new-holiday.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028034" /><br/>

After your first year ends it will return to the then-current monthly price unless cancelled.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/BQ7X4"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">61% OFF</div>Disney+ and Hulu Bundle for &#36;4.99/Month</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
<h2>Audible</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/audible-holiday.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028040" /><br/>
<br/>
Audible's <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fhz%2Faudible%2Farya%2Fmlp">holiday deal</a> takes the service down to only &#36;0.99 per month for your first three months, plus &#36;20 in Audible credit. This is more than 90 percent off the regular &#36;14.95 monthly price of the service.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fhz%2Faudible%2Farya%2Fmlp"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">OVER 90% OFF</div>Audible for &#36;0.99/Month</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
After the end of your first three months, the service will auto-renew at the then-current price, unless you cancel. This offer will end on December 1.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Amazon Music Unlimited</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/amazon-music-holiday.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028042" /><br/>
<br/>
In another Amazon-related deal, the retailer is offering <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fmusic%2Funlimited%2F">three months of its Amazon Music Unlimted streaming service for free</a>. After the end of your first three months, the service will auto-renew at &#36;11.99/month unless you cancel.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fmusic%2Funlimited%2F"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">FREE</div>Amazon Music Unlimited First Three Months</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Amazon Music Unlimited offers 100 million songs ad-free, podcasts, Audible audiobooks, spatial audio, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Paramount+</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/paramount-holiday.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028043" /><br/>
<br/>
The best Paramount+ offer for this Black Friday is a nice <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/VxE11k">discount tied into Walmart+</a> and its rewards system. If you sign up for Walmart+ at its new discounted rate of &#36;49.00 for your first year (regular &#36;98/year), you'll find multiple streaming service discounts at your disposal.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/VxE11k"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">FREE</div>Paramount+ Essential with Walmart+</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
One of these includes the option to activate a subscription to the Paramount+ Essential plan at no extra cost, so long as you have an active Walmart+ account. This is Paramount's ad-supported tier, and you can upgrade to Paramount+ Premium for an additional monthly or yearly fee.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Peacock</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/peacock-holiday.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028044" /><br/>
<br/>
Similar to Paramount+, the best Peacock discount you can find this Black Friday season is <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/VxE11k">bundled with Walmart+</a>. If you take advantage of the 50 percent off Walmart+ offer, you'll gain access to Peacock Premium at no extra cost.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/VxE11k"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">FREE</div>Peacock Premium with Walmart+</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Peacock Premium is the ad-supported tier of the streaming service, and this does not include access to Peacock Premium Plus. It's also worth noting that Walmart+ members have the option to switch between Peacock and Paramount+ once every 90 days.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in both Apple TV and Peacock, you can get a <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/?plan-picker-category=bundles#ib-section-section-10">bundle of Apple TV and Peacock Premium/Premium Plus</a> at a discounted rate this season.<br/>
