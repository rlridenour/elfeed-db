Apple Creator Studio is a subscription bundle that provides access to the Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage apps on Mac and/or iPad, with U.S. pricing set at &#36;12.99 per month or &#36;129 per year.<br/>
<br/>
A subscription to Apple Creator Studio also unlocks "intelligent features" and "premium content" in apps like Pixelmator Pro, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and later Freeform.<br/>
<br/>
On the iPhone and iPad, existing Keynote, Numbers, and Pages users will see updates to the apps in the App Store that contain both the free new features for everyone and paid new features for Apple Creator Studio subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
On the Mac, the existing Keynote, Numbers, and Pages apps were updated (to version 14.5), but only to inform users that those existing apps will no longer be receiving new features of any kind. To receive new features, including free ones, you must install the new, separate Apple Creator Studio editions (version 15.1) of the apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also updated the Keynote app on watchOS and visionOS.<br/>
