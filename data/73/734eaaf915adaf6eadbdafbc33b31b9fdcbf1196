Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.4.1, a week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-releases-ios-18-5/">releasing the iOS 18.5 update</a>. Because iOS 18.4.1 is no longer being signed, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who upgraded to iOS 18.5 are no longer able to downgrade to the previous version of iOS.<br/>

"Signing" is a server-side verification check that Apple does when iOS is downloaded onto an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. An update can't be downloaded and installed unless it passes the verification check, and the unsigning process prevents customers from installing outdated versions of iOS that are not as secure.<br/>
<br/>
Apple typically stops signing older software about a week after releasing an update, and doing so ensures that customers have the latest security improvements and are not vulnerable to known attacks.<br/>

Apple has also stopped signing iPadOS 17.7.6, because it released iPadOS 17.7.8 earlier today as a replacement for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/apple-releases-ipados-17-7-8/">iPadOS 17.7.7 update</a> that was causing issues for some people.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-4-1/">Apple Stops Signing iOS 18.4.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-4-1.2457366/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
