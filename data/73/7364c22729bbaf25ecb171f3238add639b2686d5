</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Skimming the surface of a personal canon; finding those early influences that gave directional force to my journey.
</p>
        <p><time datetime="2025-06-27" title="2025-06-27">Last month</time> I read <a href="https://blog.avas.space/trade-personal-canon/">[trade] my personal canon</a> and Ava summarized reading a handful of
other blogger’s posts to then define a <dfn>personal canon</dfn> to mean: “an
encapsulation, in list form, of things that have most shaped me&quot;; &ldquo;things that I
continue to return to, things that have influenced how I think about myself,
people, life, and the world around me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Ava’s post she then builds her list, but I stopped reading to instead perform
the exercise of reflection.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginnings">The Beginnings</h2>
<p>First, there is 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2024/12/27/twenty-books-that-have-stayed-with-me/">Twenty Books that Have Stayed With Me</a></cite>, but this is not quite the
same as a personal canon.  I consider <cite data-id="92F69ABD-4F40-4122-AD28-EC779A89B080">The Elfstones of Shannara</cite> by Terry Brooks to be part of my personal canon.  Not because it directly stuck with me,
but instead set me on a path of exploring fantasy, fantasy role-playing games,
and the relationships I’ve developed (and severed) with those at the table.</p>
<p>And there is U2’s «Joshua Tree» album, it settled into my brain in a <time datetime="1987" title="1987">1987</time>
article in Newsweek.  It would not be until <time datetime="1993" title="1993">1993</time> that I would actually get the
album.  I don’t recall hearing any of the songs from that album until I was
spinning it in my CD player.  Yet the article I read, as an 11 year old, stuck
with me.  And the imagery of that article.</p>
<p>There’s also «One Tin Soldier», as sung around a camp fire.  This was a song
we’d sing and the words sunk deep.  Those clamoring for war will never find
nor be able to plunder the true treasures of those seeking and living in peace.</p>
<p>There is also both «The Muppet Show» and «Pee-Wee’s Playhouse» which cracked and
chipped away at normalcy.  Standing as a proxy for “all pop culture that came
before” these shows seeded ideas of inclusion and belonging.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, looms larger over my personal canon than «The Empire Strikes
Back».  This was the first movie I saw in the theater, in fact I hadn’t even
seen «Star Wars: A New Hope» when I went to see «The Empire Strikes Back».  I
went as part of a friend’s birthday entourage.  There were four or so boys, all
about 5 years old.</p>
<p>I left with the love of snow reinforced (I have an undated memory of what was
likely a winter blizzard in Nebraska that happened around this time).  And for
the weeks and weeks after, all play spun around the fate of Han Solo and Darth
Vader’s reveal.</p>
<h2 id="later-day-canon">Later Day Canon</h2>
<p>In more recent years, Annie Dillard’s essay «Total Eclipse» (found in <cite data-id="F941B885-3560-42F7-91A9-B01DCDF4772B">Teaching a Stone to Talk</cite>) has burrowed deep into my psyche.  I read it before
experiencing my first eclipse, and the I can turn to her retelling of a total
solar eclipse so that I can again bask in that otherworldly moment I’ve
experienced only once.  Folks, do what you can to be in the totality of a solar
eclipse, the world changes.</p>
<p>Ursula K Le Guin’s «Band of Brothers, Stream of Sisters» blog post lurks in my
thoughts; always challenging me to think how might I avoid constructing
hierarchy?  And the older version of me wishes he could send a message back to
the younger me to read The Earthsea series.</p>
<p>Frightened Rabbit’s «Midnight Organ Fight» landed at a time I was going through
a divorce and separation.  The entire album with its lyrics of inadequacy, hurt,
and loneliness spoke to me.  And singing them aloud released those emotions.</p>
<p>The first 90 minutes of the extended version of «The Fellowship of the Ring»; I
could live in the Shire until the end of my days.  But feel as though life is
likely more mimicking <cite data-id="d334ef0c-4398-479f-ad82-4d8b9e993d2c">The Trial</cite> by Franz Kafka; and thus part of the canon.</p>
<p>Having recently watched «Pee-Wee as Himself», I know that it will stick with me.
Seeing how the two accusations against Paul Reubens most certainly strengthened
a foundational attack on the LGBTQ community as well as diversity, equity and
inclusion.  And hearing his final audio note the day before his death felt like
such a blessing.</p>
