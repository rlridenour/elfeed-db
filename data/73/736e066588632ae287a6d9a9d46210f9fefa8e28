 

<p>Haven’t done one of these in a long while. Have a few more lined up in my mind.</p>

<p>I came across a little utility which lets you bring windows to the front by moving your mouse/trackball pointer to any part of that window. Works beautifully and is perfect for those of you who are fond of navigation with the mouse/trackball.</p>

<p>The preferences are extensive and you can tweak the program to do what you want.</p>

<p>This is a menubar app which grabs the URL from your browser tab and puts it in the clipboard. A keyboard command and the URL is in your clipboard. Useful and well-designed.</p>

<p>I was amazed by how well-designed and presented the preferences for this little utility was. Great work.</p>
<p>Both utilities are heartily recommended.</p>
