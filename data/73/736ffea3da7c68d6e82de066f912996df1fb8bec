<p>Canada says it is not pursuing a free trade agreement with China after President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned the U.S. could impose 100% tariffs on Canadian imports if Ottawa finalized such a deal. Prime Minister Mark Carney framed Canada’s recent engagement with Beijing as a limited effort to unwind tariff retaliation in a few sectors, not a broad FTA. The dispute underscores how North American trade commitments and cross-border supply chains can constrain policy choices, even as Canada tries to protect key export markets.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/jsOv3sF9dps4VZpweIWAmsmL2hvuVbmkCGGtj73tQ2poMnSPQL9SozhhIfhJ86m0Z5l-InFKlGVibnPuPZg1bV31ZdnAc9DHcHo0N_g3e9pqXrhjeGwGbXHwpwyEdBoMJucSnFw0lWmbw8hbpVKf5620OgDa6zz-2aFTZxxdT7aRUfaw8vGwVGyVgU1umNc' alt='Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks amid U.S. tariff warnings over China trade.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>US rationale: Bessent said Washington wants to prevent Canada from becoming an entry point for “cheap goods” from China into the U.S. market.</li><li>Carney’s pledge: Carney said the regional trade pact with the U.S. and Mexico includes commitments around FTAs with “non-market economies” without prior notification, and he said Canada has “no intention” of pursuing one with China.</li><li>Tariff tit-for-tat: The articles describe Canada’s 2024 tariffs on Chinese EVs and certain metals, and China’s response with high import taxes on Canadian canola products plus pork and seafood.</li><li>Limited easing: Carney said Canada lowered its tariff on Chinese electric vehicles as part of a swap for reduced Chinese tariffs on certain Canadian products, and he described an initial annual cap of 49,000 Chinese EVs at a 6.1% tariff rate.</li><li>Political messaging: President Trump posted that China was “taking over” Canada while referencing ice hockey, as the tariff threat circulated publicly.</li></ul><blockquote>We have no intention of doing that with China or any other non-market economy - Mark Carney</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration (Scott Bessent): The U.S. says it could impose 100% tariffs on Canadian imports to stop Canada acting as a conduit for Chinese goods into the American market.
