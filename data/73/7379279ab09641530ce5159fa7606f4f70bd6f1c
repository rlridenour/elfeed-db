Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17e will gain upgrades including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> and a new design, according to a known Weibo leaker. <br/>

The leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a>" today claimed to reveal a selection of details about the upcoming &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e, allegedly originating in Apple's supply chain.<br/>
<br/>
The device is apparently set to feature a new industrial design, the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, and the A19 chip. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> features a "notch" at the top of the display, similar to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14. It also contains Apple's A18 chip.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to retain a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate, a front-facing 12-megapixel camera, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, and a rear 48-megapixel camera. The leaker says the biggest selling point of the device will continue to be its low price point. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is based on the design of 2022's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14, so it's possible that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could be based on 2023's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, which gained the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; and a noticeably more rounded frame. <br/>
<br/>
Reliable sources such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/kuo-iphone-17e-still-on-apple-2026-roadmap/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/11/apple-new-entry-level-iphone-e-model-annually/">Mark Gurman</a>, and Korea's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/08/apple-to-launch-iphone-17e-next-spring/"><em>The Elec</em></a> agree that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is on schedule to launch early next year. <br/>

Digital Chat Station has a relatively good track record for Apple rumors. They accurately revealed that the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus would feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/27/iphone-15-still-to-have-smaller-sensor-than-pros/">slightly smaller 48-megapixel sensor</a> than the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max, as well as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/27/5-4-inch-iphone-12-display-images/">display panel design</a> of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 back in 2020.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/iphone-17e-rumored-to-gain-new-design-and-more/">iPhone 17e Rumored to Gain New Design, Dynamic Island, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17e-rumored-to-gain-new-design-dynamic-island-and-more.2463536/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
