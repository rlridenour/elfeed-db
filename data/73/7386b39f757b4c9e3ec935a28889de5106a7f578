Aimé Bertrand has an nice post on how he <a href="https://macowners.club/posts/org-to-cal-sync-org-mode-macos-calendar/">exports scheduled items in his org agenda to his macOS calendar</a>. He mostly lives in Emacs and Org mode but, like, me also likes to have his appointments and other scheduled events in his macOS calendar. The main attraction for doing this to me is that it will sync all your appointments to all your devices as well as share it with appropriate other people. Sadly, Emacs doesn&rsquo;t run on iOS and given Apple&rsquo;s no interpreters policy, probably never will.

Bertrand wasn&rsquo;t concerned with keeping the two calendars synced; he only wanted to export his Org scheduled events to the macOS calendar. This turned out to be harder than you might think. The existing solutions didn&rsquo;t quite do what he needed so he decided to roll his own.

You can read his post for the details. He has a couple of different ways of approaching the problem. The details aside, the takeaway for me is the flexibility of Emacs and its ability to interact with other applications that may never have heard of Emacs.

If you&rsquo;re using Emacs on a Mac and would like to ensure that all your Org scheduled events are reflected on the system calendar, take a look at Bertrand&rsquo;s post for one way of solving the problem.</p>
