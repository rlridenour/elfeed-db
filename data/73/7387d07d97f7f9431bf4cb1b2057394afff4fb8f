Apple is preparing to launch two versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> over 2025 and 2026, according to a Weibo leaker.<br/>

Yesterday, supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/07/airpods-pro-3-this-year-per-kuo/">reported</a> that Apple is planning to debut the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; this year. They could arrive as soon as this week at Apple's "Awe dropping" event. <br/>
<br/>
Crucially, Kuo added that Apple is planning to introduce a successor to this year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> in 2026. This would be somewhat unusual since Apple normally waits around three years to make major changes to the AirPods' hardware. &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 debuted at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14 event in September 2022, and they were updated with a USB-C charging case and a few other tweaks in September 2023. Otherwise, Apple has waited about three years to update all of its AirPods models. <br/>
<br/>
Kuo said that the 2026 &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; will feature a "more significant" hardware upgrade in the form at least one <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/apple-still-exploring-airpods-with-cameras/">tiny infrared camera</a>. He previously said AirPods with infrared cameras could recognize hand gestures and provide an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/">enhanced spatial audio experience</a> with Apple's Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the Chinese leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>" has corroborated the rumor with some additional details and clarifications. Rather than being a new generation, the 2026 &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; will be a high-end variant of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; introduced this year, suggesting that both models will ultimately be on sale alongside each other. It is worth noting that Apple offers two version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> at &#36;129 and &#36;179 price points.<br/>
<br/>
As Kuo first said, Instant Digital similarly believes that the key differentiator will be an infrared camera for gesture controls. In fact, Apple may remove the high-end model's pressure-sensors and go all-in on gesture controls. The cost for customers is expected to exceed the current &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;'s full retail price of &#36;249.<br/>
<br/>
All signs point towards Apple unveiling the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2025-apple-event-what-to-expect/">on Tuesday, September 9</a>. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/airpods-pro-3-expected-this-year/">likely have the same heart rate monitoring feature</a> that Apple first introduced on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-announced/">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> earlier this year, along with a smaller charging case, improved sound and active noise cancellation, and more. <br/>
