Apple's Crossbody Strap reportedly features an unusual magnetic design; it likely has a "flexible metal core" that makes it magnetic along its entire length. At the ends, "rings polarized oppositely to the strap close the system." The design eliminates the need for conventional hooks or loops.<br/>

Samples of the Crossbody Strap are apparently made from a woven nylon material similar to the Apple Watch's Sport Loop bands. Apple may also introduce a silicone variant. <br/>
