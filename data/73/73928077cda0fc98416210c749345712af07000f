<p>I enjoyed Amelie Lens and Charlotte de Witte so much yesterday at work, I logged back into my Bandcamp account. It&rsquo;s been a while, and I forgot what it means to own music.</p>
<p>I have a music folder in my Synology, which mostly contains electronic FLAC files I bought from Bandcamp. Because these are artists who passed the &ldquo;OK, you&rsquo;re actually worth my money&rdquo; threshold, it obviously means I have a good selection there to choose from. In contrast, YouTube Music (yes, it&rsquo;s my streaming service since I got grandfathered in along with my YouTube account for a cheap price) considers what&rsquo;s popular, and what&rsquo;s popular is not always what&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>While I did find Lens and de Witte on YouTube Music yesterday in my office, it&rsquo;s not the best place for discovery, especially when you just go through their mixes and lists trying to find something. Exploring music takes time. It&rsquo;s something I enjoyed doing with Bandcamp, until they were bought by Epic, anyway. I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;ll do when Bandcamp goes away in its current form—as I always say, it&rsquo;s not a matter of if, but of when.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of music I usually spend more time, money, and effort on. Classical Music (I took some time to learn about it, it&rsquo;s best approached as a history class) and Electronic Music. Both genres are too big for their own definitions (Classical music may also be current, so by definition it can&rsquo;t still be &ldquo;classic&rdquo;, Electronic music basically means anything done with a computer, which today means everything&hellip;), and I love getting lost and discovering new music. At some point, I even considered getting into Electronic music myself, but the path there is too long and intimidating (and expensive). Still, if there&rsquo;s one area in my life I feel I&rsquo;m missing out on right now, it&rsquo;s this.</p>
