<p>APDA director <a href="https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/cjennings3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carolyn Dicey Jennings</a> (UC Merced) writes at the APDA blog:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We have spent the last several months collecting data on current philosophy PhD students and recent graduates, with the goal of providing information to the philosophy community about employment outcomes and the graduate experience. Anyone in the database who graduated in the past 10 years or who is a current philosophy PhD student should have received access to their personalized APDA dashboard and a link to the anonymous survey. However, we were unable to easily find email addresses for some of you, and others have email addresses that bounced. </em></p>
<p>If you have not already received an email from APDA over the past couple of months, you can still take part in the survey. Just provide your contact information <a href="https://apda.ghost.io/calling-all-philosophy-phds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this page</a>.</p>
