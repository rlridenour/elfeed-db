<p>President Donald Trump, today in the Oval Office alongside his “very good friend” Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, after ABC News reporter <a href="https://www.threads.com/@iamarslan/post/DRNc3f9kmh-">Mary Bruce had the temerity to pose a question</a> regarding Mohammed having ordered the brutal murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People are wise to your hoax. ABC, your company, your crappy
company, is one of the perpetrators. And I’ll tell you something,
I think the license should be taken away from ABC because your
news is so fake, and it’s so wrong. And we have a great
commissioner, a chairman, who should look at that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from Trump, regarding Khashoggi’s murder:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking
about. Whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things happen, indeed.</p>

<p>Disney (ABC’s owner), a year ago <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/16/nx-s1-5230274/abc-settles-with-trump-for-15-million-now-he-wants-to-sue-other-news-outlets">settled a lawsuit Trump filed against ABC News</a> — a lawsuit most experts agreed <a href="https://fair.org/home/abc-settles-with-trump-in-a-case-it-could-have-won/">ABC would have won</a> — for $16 million, <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/the-great-fluffening-of-2024/sharetoken/b6e8708a-fc8b-4ae4-8843-9cc9c009f969">in what clearly amounted to a bribe</a>.</p>

<p>Yours truly, last month, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/07/hodges-cook-iceblock">in a post on Apple’s capitulation to Trump regarding the ICEBlock app for iOS</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you give a bully your lunch money, they always come back
for more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Bob Iger <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/09/24/kimmel-returns">gets that now</a>. “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/03/fuck-you-make-me">Fuck you, make me</a>” remains the correct response to these threats.</p>
