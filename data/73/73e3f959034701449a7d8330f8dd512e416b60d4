<p>But that can’t be right. Try again, Fred. What’s under <em>that</em> mask?</p>

<p>Holy shit! It’s Beats Pro all the way down! We–the company that usually sells two-packs of janky as hell wireless earbuds for, like, eight bucks–are selling the premier product on the market??</p>
<p>And yes, $119 is still a lot of money, but it’s also $80 less than you’ll get these for on Amazon.</p>
<p>Oh, wait… Did we mention these are really, really good earbuds yet? Do we even <em>need</em> to mention that? That they’re apparently super comfortable and have great bass and that they get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Fit-Pro-Cancelling-Built/dp/B09JL41N9C?th=1&tag=mehdown-20#averageCustomerReviewsAnchor">a 4.2 out of 5 on Amazon based on nearly 31,000 reviews</a>? And all those great reviews are with the aforementioned $200 price tag?</p>
<p>Well, we did now.</p>
<p>Buy some Beats Pro earbuds if you want Beats Pro Earbuds.</p>
