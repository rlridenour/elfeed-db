<p>An idea just comes to me. I&#8217;ve been writing for a long time, so the ideas come partially formed. Not written but formed into the beginnings of a familiar shape. It is critical in the next hour that I write this idea down somewhere accessible because it&#8217;s just an idea, and failure to capture it means it will disappear as simply as it appeared.</p>
<p>Whether this idea becomes an actual piece is defined by the next 72 hours. If I succeed in sitting down and expanding the idea, the probability of a completed piece increases significantly. This first attempt is an hour of my time, perhaps more if the window aligns with a weekend, so call this first investment ninety minutes on average.</p>
<p>In this session, I am taking the wisp of an idea and giving it shape. What was a three-to-five-word reminder is now five to ten paragraphs. If I&#8217;m lucky, I can see the beginning and part of the middle. If I&#8217;m really lucky, section titles are starting to show up. These section titles are similar to the initial inspiration in that they, to me, elegantly encapsulate part of the idea. If I can&#8217;t find a section title but know I&#8217;ve moved from beginning to middle, I write a dummy title, usually <strong>Something</strong>.</p>
<h2>Something</h2>
<p>If I make it to the middle of a piece, the publishing probability has again increased significantly. Still, as I&#8217;ve matured and relaxed about my writing, the number of abandoned articles has increased significantly. If this reads like bad news, I understand, but I&#8217;ve learned two important facts that affect this moment of writing.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is always more writing. Every piece doesn&#8217;t need to be finished.</li>
<li>The remaining work to publish this on the blog is significantly more than I expected. If this piece is for a book, it is twice as much.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the back of my head, sitting and staring at this half-formed piece, I&#8217;m quietly asking, &#8220;Is this worth finishing?&#8221; What pushes me over is the idea remains stuck in my head. There is still something to discover, to say, that I am curious to find.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wildly guessing that 30% of the work is done now. 30% might be too high because what happens now is much more of a slog. I like writing. No, I love writing, but middle to end means I must continue to ignite what inspired me initially, but now it needs to make sense to you. This isn&#8217;t a journal entry; this is an artifact that I am placing into the world for judgment, so I must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish the middle. The end of the middle is the end of the most challenging part of the writing. A good ending is a work, but it&#8217;s usually a clever and synthesized arrangement of your beginning and middle. There&#8217;s a chance I&#8217;ve already found it, but if I haven&#8217;t, I&#8217;m not worried. I&#8217;ll slap something together.</li>
<li>First pass edit. I print out the piece, and I edit it somewhere that isn&#8217;t near a keyboard. This change of perspective is a coherency pass <em>Does this make sense?</em> Just about anything can happen during this editing. So much so, I have a well-defined system of notation that tells me exactly what I need to do the piece because my regular scribbles are often indecipherable.</li>
<li>First pass edit changes landed. Taking my written notes, I graft them onto the piece. We&#8217;re somewhere between five and ten hours of work now. We&#8217;re somewhere between one day and three months from when I started. Pieces languish. Life gets complicated. The half-life of an idea is extended by the amount of work invested, but sometimes&#8230; it just fades.</li>
</ul>
<p>But not this one. This piece will be published, and I know the precise moment: I can see the entire shape of the piece in my head. It&#8217;s not a geometric shape; it&#8217;s a feeling shape where I understand the beginning, middle, and end. Chances are significant chunks of the piece are not written or edited, but if I can see the end, the publishing probability reaches 90%.</p>
<p>I know the ending of this piece.</p>
<p>I know it because I knew the title was the ending when the idea arrived. This has allowed me not to put a section header where the ending became obvious, which is right here, incidentally. No, I need to finish describing the amount of work because this piece, confusingly, <strong>is not about writing</strong>.</p>
<p>With the final shape in mind, I finish the writing. Call this another two hours of work. I do a Grammarly pass (30 minutes) and a technical pass – links and images (another 10). The piece is dropped into Visual Code, where I zap gremlins, I produce the featured image, I push the piece to WordPress, do another read (30 minutes), and then hit publish.</p>
<p>I estimate I&#8217;ve devoted ten to fifteen hours of my life to your average blog article. The question is: what makes it&#8230;</p>
<h2>Worth it?</h2>
<p>One compliment. Just one.</p>
<p>When I hit publish, I broadcast to Mastodon, Threads, BlueSky, and the Rands Leadership Slack, and I&#8217;m looking for straightforward feedback on having devoted ten to fifteen hours of my life. A compliment.</p>
<p>Now, this can&#8217;t be from someone I know because while I trust these folks, they are biased, lovely, and biased. This is a thoughtful compliment from a stranger who I do not know and does not know me, and wants to say something interesting about the piece briefly. When this occurs, I release a deep breath I have held since I hit publish.</p>
<p>Compliments work.</p>
<p>As you climb the leadership ladder, you&#8217;ll have the idea of performance management in all its forms beaten into you. Your interpretation of what success looks like is often, &#8220;I need to give them feedback to improve effectively.&#8221; Advice, constructive advice. Sometimes critical. This is a reasonable interpretation, but half a strategy. Explaining where they need to focus is as important as clearly acknowledging when they have.</p>
<p>But there is another compliment out there. It&#8217;s a random selfless acknowledgement. To the stranger. <em>I love those kicks.</em> At work, to the person you&#8217;ve never met, interrupting <em>This Keynote template is&#8230; stunning.</em> To the human you&#8217;ve known forever, <em>I don&#8217;t say it enough, but I am glad we are friends.</em></p>
<p>The rule is: people want to be seen.</p>
<p>You have no idea how much work goes into a human&#8217;s chosen passion. When they become adept at their work, the simplicity or approachability of their &#8216;product&#8217; might give you the erroneous impression that because it&#8217;s clever, approachable, or just straight up fun, the work involved was simple, obvious, or&#8230; fun.</p>
<p>People want to be seen. Writing as an introvert, I can confirm the last thing I want is public recognition. I would prefer it if you slid a folded note under the desk where I am hiding. Make no eye contact. People are a lot of work for me. The reason I spend so much time writing it down is that I don’t want to explain it to you face-to-face.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>I am <strong>deeply</strong> interested in your folded note. Just tuck it under my foot.</p>
