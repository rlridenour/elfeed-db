<p>We’ve been hearing for a few weeks now that Apple is&nbsp;<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/30/apple-might-ditch-internal-ai-efforts-for-siri-revamp-use-openai-or-anthropic-instead/?__readwiseLocation=">considering using a third party LLM for Siri</a>, particularly Claude. I understand this is not usually the Apple way of solving a problem like this, but at least for the short term, it seems the right move.</p>



<p>I have no doubt that Apple will eventually have its own perfectly acceptable model to drive Siri, but at this point we just need Siri to work flawlessly. And if using someone else’s model for a year or two is how we get that, than I say get out the checkbook.</p>
