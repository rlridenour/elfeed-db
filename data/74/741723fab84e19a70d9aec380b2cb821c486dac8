<p>At some point, you may come across a trusted command-line utility prompting you for a password, and Emacs shell happily displaying each typed character to the nearby-world to see. Luckily, you can train Emacs to recognize new password prompts and hide the typed characters in modes deriving from comint. Append the password prompt REGEXP:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(setq comint-password-prompt-regexp (concat comint-password-prompt-regexp
                                            &quot;\\|&quot;
                                            &quot;Password for red alert:&quot;))
</code></pre>
