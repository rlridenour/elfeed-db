Apple customers in Australia and New Zealand are starting to receive their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max orders, since it is already Friday, September 19 in those two countries.<br/>

Orders of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a>, Apple Watch Series 11, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE 3</a> are also arriving.<br/>
<br/>
Apple fans who ordered a new device will soon be sharing photos and first impressions of the new &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models on Instagram, Reddit, the <em>MacRumors</em> forums, and other social networks. If you've received one of the new devices, let us know in the comments below and share pictures and your initial thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
There are no Apple retail stores in New Zealand, so customers in Australia are the first to be able to pick up their new devices or make a purchase in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>. In-store stock in Australia will provide insight into what we can expect at other Apple locations around the world.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max did sell out during the pre-order period, and online shipping estimates are now into October. We are expecting retail stores to have available supply though, so if you missed pre-ordering, you should be able to get a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> from Apple or from another big box retailer like Target, Walmart, or Best Buy.<br/>
<br/>
After Australia and New Zealand, sales and deliveries of the new &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models and the other devices will begin in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and finally, North America. Some Apple Stores worldwide are opening early at 8:00 a.m. local time to allow customers to pick up reserved devices and make walk-in purchases.<br/>
