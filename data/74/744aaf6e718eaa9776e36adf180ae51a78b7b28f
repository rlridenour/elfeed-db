It has been more than three years since Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-discontinues-27-inch-imac/">discontinued the 27-inch iMac</a>, as part of its move away from Intel processors. Since then, the 24-inch iMac has been Apple's only all-in-one desktop computer, with no larger model available.<br/>

Will a larger iMac ever make a comeback? Below, we recap the latest rumors.<br/>
<br/>
In November 2023, Apple announced that it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/">no plans to release a new version of the 27-inch iMac</a> with an Apple silicon chip at that time. Instead, Apple recommended pairing its standalone Studio Display with a Mac Studio or Mac mini. But an even larger iMac could materialize one day, if rumors from the past are still accurate.<br/>
<br/>
In late 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/imac-with-over-30-inch-display/">both</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">said</a> Apple was developing a 32-inch iMac, which Kuo said would launch in 2025. Kuo said the larger iMac's screen would feature mini-LED backlighting, allowing for increased brightness and a higher contrast ratio compared to the current LCD model.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it has been many months since we received any sort of update about Apple potentially releasing another larger iMac. In February, Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/16/pro-display-xdr-2-and-larger-imac-rumors/">briefly mentioned</a> that "Apple also will probably eventually get around to offering a larger-screen iMac," but he has not commented on the topic since as far as we have seen.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, the latest update on a larger iMac is essentially that there is no update, unfortunately. Apple is expected to update the 24-inch iMac with an M5 chip by early next year, though, and that would be the next timely opportunity for the company to release the rumored 32-inch iMac, if such a computer is ever coming.<br/>

In the meantime, Apple continues to sell two standalone monitors, including the 27-inch Studio Display from 2022 and the 32-inch Pro Display XDR from 2019.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/larger-imac-rumor-recap/">Will Apple Release a Larger iMac Again?
