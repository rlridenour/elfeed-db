<li>Plug them in, and the light will attract the bugs to the sticky pad</li>
<li>Very unassuming, and the pads face the wall, hiding the dead bugs from view</li>
<li>When a pad is full, just peel it, toss it, and replace it</li>
<li>Are they Mac-compatible: Oh man, we hope so, because the new line of mosquitoes Apple just released are awful</li>
</ul><h1>Buggin' Out</h1><p>We’ve been over this before.</p>
<p>Bugs outside? Annoying. You just want to take a seat on the deck, enjoy a hot summer afternoon with your book, and you can’t make it through a sentence without stopping to swat at some little asshole trying to buzz their way into your ears.</p>
<p>And yet, it’s easy enough to handle even a swarm of mayflies outdoors, because there’s a simple solution: go back inside.</p>
<p>When you’re safely in your house, meanwhile, if there’s even one gnat buzzing from person to person at the dinner table, that’s enough to drive you CRAZY.</p>
<p>These things can help with that.</p>
<p>They’re sleek little plug-ins that no one will notice. Once in the outlet, the LED beckons the bugs over, where they get caught on the adhesive pad (which faces the wall, so the bug graveyard can hide in plain sight). After that, it’s as easy as peeling, tossing, and putting another sticky pad on.</p>
<p>Which means, you don’t have to worry about a bunch of little nasties getting all up in whatever’s on your plate.</p>
<p>Or in your cup.</p>
<p>After all, there are just some boozy beverages that seem to attract an inordinate amount of attention from nature’s six-legged children.</p>
<p>You know, drinks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Gnatural Light,</li>
<li>a Mosquitjo,</li>
<li>a Manhattant,</li>
<li>a glass of the louse red,</li>
<li>a Smirnoff Lice,</li>
<li>a fly tai,</li>
<li>a mothcow mule,</li>
<li>a zom-bee,</li>
<li>a hot buttered-fly rum,</li>
<li>and a grasshopper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty bad, huh? But these bug traps? Not bad at all. Good, in fact.</p>
<p>So buy them unless you love having a house full of bugs.</p>
