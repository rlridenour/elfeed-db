<p id="p2">The latest macOS Tahoe beta 26.2 includes a new video-calling feature called Edge Light, coming to Apple silicon Macs later this year. It&rsquo;s a video effect that you can access from the menu bar, just like Backgrounds, Center Stage, and Portrait mode, that creates a virtual ring light on your Mac&rsquo;s screen, helping to light your face on FaceTime, Zoom, and other video calls as the days grow shorter.</p>
<p id="p3">The idea is simple, and the implementation is clever. When you enable Edge Light, the outer edge of your Desktop is replaced with a bright, adjustable border. The brightness of Edge Light is adjustable, as is its color temperature, allowing for a range from warmer to cooler colors, just like many physical LED lights designed specifically for video production. The virtual ring light sits on top of your Desktop and windows, but it fades away as your pointer approaches, allowing you to see everything on your screen.</p>

<p id="p5">Edge Light is made possible by Apple silicon, using a combination of the Mac&rsquo;s Neural Engine, which detects your face, and the Image Signal Processor, which measures and adjusts Edge Light&rsquo;s brightness based on surrounding lighting. Edge Light will work on all Apple silicon Macs when Tahoe 26.2 is released, but Mac models released in 2024 or later will also have the option to turn the feature on automatically when low light is detected.</p>

<p id="p8">In my brief testing of Edge Light, I noticed that the effect is noticeable in a very dim room, but as you&rsquo;d expect, less so as the room brightens. I also noticed that Edge Light was brighter when set to turn on automatically rather than manually, even though switching between the two didn&rsquo;t move the brightness slider. I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s going on there, but it&rsquo;s a beta, so that may change. I also enjoyed how the virtual ring light widened as I increased the brightness.</p>
<p id="p9">I have a couple of lights set up along the back edge of my desk because we record video for our podcasts, but most people don&rsquo;t have that setup. For them, Edge Light will be a nice addition, reducing those early-morning and late-afternoon shadows. And despite the lights I have installed, sometimes it&rsquo;s just easier to turn on something like Edge Light, so I expect to get use out of it too, whether I&rsquo;m away from my desk on a laptop or sitting at my desk.</p>
<p id="p10">We&rsquo;ll have more macOS Tahoe 26.2 coverage when it and Apple&rsquo;s other 26.2 releases exit beta.</p>
