<h3>Apple Working on All-New 'Charismatic' Operating System</h3><br/>
Apple's long-rumored home hub device and eventual tabletop robot will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/16/apple-working-on-all-new-operating-system/">run on a new operating system code-named "Charismatic,"</a> according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>

Apple is nearing the finish line on development for the initial public release of iOS 26, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/everything-new-in-ios-26-beta-7/">pushing out new betas to developers and public beta testers</a> this week.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Apple Rumored to Launch 'TechWoven' Cases for iPhone 17 With 'Crossbody Strap' Option</h3><br/>
Earlier this week, we got our first glimpse at what will reportedly be Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/19/apple-to-introduce-finewoven-successor/">new premium case material for the upcoming iPhone 17 lineup</a>, replacing the highly criticized FineWoven cases that debuted alongside the iPhone 15 lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/techwoven-cases-1.jpg" alt="" width="2047" height="1150" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015558" /><br/>
A subsequent leak indicates the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/techwoven-cases-crossbody-strap-rumor/">new material may be dubbed "TechWoven,"</a> with the cases available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/21/iphone-17-techwoven-case-colors/">a number of colors</a> for the various models. Previously seen lanyard attachment points on Apple's first-party cases for the iPhone 17 lineup may instead be intended for a "Crossbody Strap" accessory mentioned on the alleged case packaging.<br/>

<h3>Apple Releases iOS 18.6.2 With Security Fixes</h3><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/apple-releases-ios-18-6-2-with-security-fixes/">released minor iOS 18.6.2, iPadOS 18.6.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.6.1 updates</a> delivering security fixes. According to the Apple's security support document, the updates address a memory corruption issue that could occur from being sent a malicious image file.<br/>
<br/>

Apple says it's aware that the issue <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/ios-18-6-2-vulnerability-fix/">may have been actively exploited</a> in an "extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals," so while most users are unlikely to be targeted, it's still a good idea to make sure your devices are updated.<br/>
