<p>Voters in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Serb-majority entity, Republika Srpska, have chosen Sinisa Karan, a close ally of removed president Milorad Dodik, as their new president in a snap election, according to preliminary, partial results from the central election commission released on Sunday. The commission said Karan received just over half the vote while opposition candidate Branko Blanusa of the Serb Democratic Party trailed by a few percentage points in what was described as a tight race. The ballot was called after Bosnia’s international overseer removed Dodik from office over his policies that sought to transfer powers from the state level to Republika Srpska, which Western diplomats warned could undermine the Dayton peace framework that ended the country’s 1992–1995 war. The result signals continuity in Republika Srpska’s leadership at a sensitive time, but the peaceful conduct of voting and the use of established election procedures also show that political disputes are still being channeled through ballots rather than violence in this post-conflict society.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eG9hFb51C_uVjdGwdwMRtqRjyfd6xBFnAscm8rB9v75X4p2DQ2FlFFLdP5IjoA7g_KT3MLA4lMkz212VMhaVqmmWzr76eUfdIkIkwMsXN4UCH9ZTKvZ5MIjnh_s8CwK9LpDH_2T6PM3WEJwKIx7uiYiIGHIRzUQX8wmZX8TKznBgOip6b4JAYJED4-zysJ6VvqTbplT7WAPUqH1EZQUApgKHsWRkS8hGZ3bVa6eF1lrCcsLEvDoIlDKzUp0JTKBv21Wzc9dmxYYJlAo-XsGu' alt='Former Republika Srpska president Milorad Dodik and newly elected president Sinisa Karan at a press conference after preliminary results in Banja Luka.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Turnout and margin: With nearly 93% of polling stations counted, the election commission reported that the winning candidate’s lead over his main rival was only a few percentage points, underscoring how politically divided Republika Srpska’s electorate remains.</li><li>Role of courts: The snap vote followed a June decision by Bosnia’s international overseer—acting in coordination with the country’s legal framework—to dismiss Milorad Dodik from the presidency over moves viewed as challenging state-level authority.</li><li>Autonomous status: Republika Srpska functions as an autonomous entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina’s federal structure, with its own president and government but obligations to respect the country’s central institutions established after the peace accords.</li><li>Opposition stance: The Serb Democratic Party, whose candidate came close to victory, campaigned on promises to ease tensions with international partners and focus on economic conditions within Republika Srpska.</li><li>Future relations: Analysts quoted in local coverage said Karan’s victory will likely maintain Dodik’s political influence and could prolong disagreements with Western diplomats over the transfer of competences from state to entity level.</li></ul><blockquote>According to preliminary, unofficial and incomplete results, Sinisa Karan won 50.89 per cent of the votes - Jovan Kalaba</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Milorad Dodik and SNSD leadership: Dodik and his party framed Karan’s win as confirmation that voters still back their political course in Republika Srpska despite Dodik’s removal from office earlier this year.
