<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is developing an AI-powered wearable pin the size of an
AirTag that is equipped with multiple cameras, a speaker,
microphones and wireless charging, according to people with direct
knowledge of the project. The device could be released as early as
2027, they said.</p>

<p>Don’t make the mistake of thinking that because existing AI pins have sucked (and in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/nyt-humane">one</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/18/hp-buys-humane">notable</a> <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/20/hp-humane">case</a>, flopped in spectacular fashion), they’re all going to suck. Google Glass was an embarrassment but glasses are a great form factor. MP3 players used to suck too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Such a product would position Apple to compete more effectively
with OpenAI, which is planning its own AI-powered devices, and
Meta Platforms, which is already selling smart glasses that offer
access to its AI assistant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is very strange to put OpenAI’s upcoming io device(s) in the same sentence as Meta’s glasses, which are a real product you can buy today. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/14/meta-claims-glasses-surging">None of these things</a> are setting the world on fire though.</p>
