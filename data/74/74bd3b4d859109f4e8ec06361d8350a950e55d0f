A <a href="https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1997232848794014096?s=20">new image</a> shared by prototype collector and leaker Kosutami appears to show parts designed for an unreleased all-black Apple Vision headset.<br/>

The image shows what seems to be a Vision Pro's left power strap and audio pod with the attached power cable. It seems to be identical to Apple's existing hardware, but uses a dark finish not seen on any production Vision Pro hardware. <br/>

Kosutami <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-vision-air-rumored-with-new-design/">previously claimed</a> that Apple has been testing a thinner and lighter mixed-reality headset referred to internally as "Vision Air," featuring a Midnight-colored exterior and reduced weight achieved by switching several structural components and the battery enclosure to titanium. According to the leaker, this model would retain an aluminum exterior but adopt a deep bluish-black finish rather than the Vision Pro's current silver and white.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Kosutami also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/images-of-apple-vision-air-cable/">shared images</a> of a new Lightning-style connector in Midnight said to be intended for a next-generation Vision headset. The existing Vision Pro uses a 12-pin connector, while the unreleased cable featured only eight pins, which seemed to indicate that Apple may have been redesigning the external battery system for future headsets.<br/>

Apple had been widely expected to release a lower-cost headset called the "Vision Air," as well as a redesigned second-generation Vision Pro. However, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported in October that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/01/apple-ai-smart-glasses-focus/">paused development of all Vision headsets</a> in order to accelerate work on AI-powered smart glasses.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/07/more-black-vision-pro-parts-surface-online/">More All-Black Vision Pro Prototype Parts Surface Online</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/more-all-black-vision-pro-prototype-parts-surface-online.2474341/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
