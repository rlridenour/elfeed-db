<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>Sometimes I use <code>C-x C-b</code> to get list of buffers so I can
clean it up a little after some time.
To do it I mark some buffers with <code>d</code> (to delete) and then press <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Today I wanted to filter that list of buffers to a particular project/folder and turned out I can&rsquo;t. <br>
There is no way to filter <strong>*Buffer List*</strong>.<br></p>
<h2 id="ibuffer">IBuffer</h2>
<p>If you look up for Buffer Menu in EmacsWiki you&rsquo;ll find the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BufferMenu">Enhancements section</a> which mentions <code>IBufferMode</code> which is built-in since Emacs 22.</p>
<p>This mode is literally Buffer Menu on steroids. Looks pretty much the same so from UI perspective you&rsquo;ll see no changes (almost).</p>
<p>To filter buffers by directory just type <code>/ F</code> and enter the project/folder name.
The only thing left is <code>C-x h d x</code> to mark all buffers and delete them.<br>
To remove all the applied filters just do <code>/ /</code>.</p>
<p>The number of filtering commands available by default is great.<br>
You can find them by <code>C-h m</code> (describe-mode) and then look for &ldquo;Filtering commands&rdquo; section. Go through other sections as well to get more familiar with ibuffer capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="doom--spacemacs">Doom &amp; Spacemacs</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re Doom user you probably already enjoying this mode since it&rsquo;s enabled by default.<br>
In Spacemacs you can enable it by turning on <code>ibuffer</code> layer.</p>
<p>Both of these config distributions remap standard <code>C-x C-b</code> to call <code>ibuffer</code> and I suggest you do the same if you use custom config like me.</p>
