<p>President Trump has declared a U.S. national emergency related to Cuba and moved to increase pressure on Havana by targeting the island’s access to imported oil. The administration’s approach includes threatening tariffs on countries that supply oil to Cuba, alongside recent steps aimed at cutting off oil flows that have helped keep Cuba running. At the same time, President Trump said the United States is “starting to talk to Cuba,” suggesting a possible diplomatic channel even as sanctions tighten. On the ground in Havana, residents described long waits for fuel and limited availability in the local-currency market, underscoring how quickly policy shifts can translate into everyday hardship.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/3U8nafSWam3dp5I2e4JBzBtOBhp3JClJoQiWhzGe1Bkw6ERYnCe-Kf_hd1Dwzj67IAUBqSNXg8RbY-XR1lmohJcM0Nbk-IoyU4CbLGRmguqifGPgVhrcem1pr1TFOWc_LlHYN6cZ68fSWVh7w7OB8TtiCEP_NUKi0ph1PfpGBhZK2Fd21Gnk0cw81A1WNN9CPNiIxxbAERN5c87xkMJsZWHU9urjlopGw5Kzt3HZQPACR3pFhM2aZa5gHxL-V1P220pEMEQQWWC5bSc2EyfI' alt='Fuel queues and shortages have become part of daily life in Havana as supplies tighten.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Executive order basis: The executive order frames Cuba’s government policies as an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to U.S. national security and foreign policy, language typically used to unlock emergency authorities.</li><li>Dollar-only fuel: In Havana, some stations reportedly sell fuel only in U.S. dollars at prices many Cubans cannot afford, pushing people into long queues when supplies arrive.</li><li>Mexico’s warning: Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum warned the oil-supplier tariff approach could harm hospitals, food supplies, and other basic services for ordinary Cubans.</li><li>Venezuela factor: President Trump said Cuba’s situation had worsened after losing access to Venezuelan oil and money, which he described as a key support for Havana.</li><li>Talks without details: While saying outreach has begun, President Trump did not provide specifics on timing, participants, or the level of contact between Washington and Havana.</li></ul><blockquote>We’re starting to talk to Cuba. - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. administration: The White House frames the emergency declaration and tariff threat as a national-security response to Cuba’s alignment with hostile foreign powers and terrorist groups, according to the executive order description cited in coverage.
