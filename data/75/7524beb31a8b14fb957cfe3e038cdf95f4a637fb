In an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125851">updated support document</a>, Apple says that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 or earlier should install the latest software updates to ensure that their mobile devices are able to make emergency 000 calls. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-releases-ios-26-2-1/">Apple released</a> iOS 18.7.4, iOS 16.7.13, iOS 15.8.6, and iOS 12.5.8 for older iPhones today. <br/>
<br/>
Back in December, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/15/iphone-12-australia-users-should-install-ios-26-2/">there was a technical failure</a> in Australia that prevented the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 models from being able to make emergency calls, which Apple addressed with the iOS 26.2 update. The additional software updates released today should help prevent further issues on other older devices in the future, as well as cellular Apple Watch models. watchOS 26.2.1, also available today, addresses any potential issues with the Apple Watch Series 6 and later. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says that Australian mobile network operators are continuing to improve support for emergency calling on their networks, which led to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 technical failure. While carriers are working to mitigate further issues, there is a possibility that some older mobile phones might still run into problems.<blockquote>In the rare event that these exceptional circumstances affecting mobile operators' networks were to happen again, some older mobile phones might still encounter the same issue reaching emergency services through an alternate available network.<br/>
<br/>
Software updates are available for the following iPhone and Apple Watch models that might be impacted by this network issue. You are encouraged to update your devices to the latest software version.</blockquote><br/>
