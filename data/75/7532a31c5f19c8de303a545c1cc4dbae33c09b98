<li>The tent isn’t luxurious, but it’ll keep you dry and warm in a pinch</li>
<li>Same goes for the ponchos: use them once, maybe twice, in an emergency</li>
<li>Buy them and then hopefully never use them</li>
<li>Each one carries a survival whistle!</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but you can reward yourself with a margarita when you’re done</li>
</ul><h1>The Curse</h1><p>Here’s what <a href="/@pmarin">@pmarin</a> had to say one of the times we sold these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried the poncho; it was not bad. Not super-thin or flimsy. Was a pain to fold and stuff back into included pouch but got it in there. I would much rather have something like this handy, than have nothing. As I mentioned first time these were up, if I had to do something like crawl under my truck, the tent would double as a tarp I could spread on the ground. For the price, worth having.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We share this for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>To thank pmarin for opening up the ponchos so you don’t have to.</li>
</ol>
<p>And…</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>To illustrate that this sale is essentially a curse.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re seeing this, and you’re reading this, you need to buy this.</p>
<p>Imagine, for a second, you’re in the situation pmarin describes at the end of that comment: you have to crawl under your truck to do some unexpected work when it’s wet and muddy. Or let’s say you’re stranded overnight in some nasty weather.</p>
<p>What do you want to think about in a scenario like that?</p>
<p>The hot cup of coffee you’ll treat yourself to when this is over.</p>
<p>The steamy shower or long warm bath you’ll take.</p>
<p>A big breakfast, a steak dinner, your own bed, curling up on the couch with your kids and/or pets watching a baking show.</p>
<p>In short, you want to be thinking of any number of things that might be pleasant to think about while dealing with something unpleasant.</p>
<p>The thing you don’t want to be thinking: <em>Dammit, Meh offered something that would vastly improve this situation and I arrogantly assumed I didn’t need it.</em></p>
<p>And now that’s all you’ll be able to think about. Unless you buy these things. Or buy one of them at least.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’ve got: an emergency tent or a couple emergency ponchos for waiting out a bad day or a bad night in the out of doors. As pmarin explains, these things aren’t <em>totally</em> single use. As in: they’re maybe two or three use.</p>
<p>Even so, you’ll be glad to have them if you need them.</p>
<p>And if you don’t need them, you’ll be glad you only spent $5.</p>
<p>In conclusion: this is a good deal.</p>
