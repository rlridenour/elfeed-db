<p>French President Emmanuel Macron met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing at the start of a three-day state visit focused on encouraging China to support efforts toward a ceasefire in Ukraine and to reduce tensions over trade between China and the European Union. Macron proposed what he called a three-part agenda – geopolitical stability, economic rebalancing and environmental sustainability – arguing that closer coordination between Paris and Beijing is vital at a time of war and economic strain. The talks also come as the EU scrutinises Chinese industrial subsidies, especially for electric vehicles, while Beijing seeks to present itself as a reliable partner and alternative market amid higher US tariffs. Both leaders publicly stressed multilateral cooperation and pledged to deepen dialogue on global crises, even as longstanding differences over issues such as Russia’s war and market access remain.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/h9H5YtUyAItJRi2d-XfdnlXnbWSJjbkndnwbiABrKpDQKGZsdO5Fwols3u_B-ilYFRnCeuC8v34LM6L4uYd6bzJzzbHxKqPCGCUTLy-JeIIa' alt='French President Emmanuel Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands after a joint press conference at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on December 4, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Business delegation: Macron is accompanied by a large group of French business leaders aiming to secure commercial deals in sectors such as aviation and energy as he seeks to boost his foreign policy credentials and economic record at home.</li><li>Xi’s rare travel: Xi Jinping plans to accompany Macron to Sichuan province after their Beijing talks, an uncommon gesture that signals the importance China places on the relationship with France.</li><li>World order concerns: Macron warned in his meeting with Xi of a risk of &quot;disintegration&quot; of the international order if major powers fail to cooperate, while both leaders called for strengthening multilateral institutions.</li><li>G7 summit role: France, which will chair the G7 next year, is encouraging Xi to engage more directly with global governance discussions, including possible participation around the G7 summit agenda.</li><li>Environmental focus: Alongside security and trade, Macron pressed for deeper cooperation on climate and environmental issues as part of his proposed three-pronged framework for Franco-Chinese ties.</li></ul><blockquote>Now, more than ever, dialogue between China and France is vital. - Emmanuel Macron</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Emmanuel Macron: Macron proposed a &quot;positive three-fold agenda&quot; for relations with China, centred on geopolitical stability, economic rebalancing and environmental sustainability, and said the ability of Paris and Beijing to work together would be decisive for peace and stability.
