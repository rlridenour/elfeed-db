Apple's website does not provide a reason for the closure. We do not expect any major changes.<br/>
<br/>
The Forum Shops is a shopping mall inside Caesars Palace, the famous luxury hotel and casino resort located on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada.<br/>
<br/>
While its store at The Forum Shops is closed, Apple says customers can visit its Fashion Show store, which is located just one mile further north on the Las Vegas Strip.<br/>
