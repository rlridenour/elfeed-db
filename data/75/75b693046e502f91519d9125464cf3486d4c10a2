<p>China dispatched coast guard vessels through waters around the Japan‑administered Senkaku islands — which Beijing calls the Diaoyu — in what the Chinese service described as a &quot;rights enforcement patrol&quot;, a move that Tokyo views as provocative and that comes after Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi made comments about a possible military response to an attack on Taiwan; analysts say the action has intensified a diplomatic spat with no easy diplomatic fix. The patrol raises tensions in the East China Sea by putting Chinese maritime law‑enforcement ships nearer to territory Tokyo administers and increases the risk of further incidents between the two governments.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/LNM0mud6GS_jG5re9G-1ImIhClK8IFtTtfn0j4c1Z_1HkjlFDladVP7muvYZjys2b715wo-pRqhkqrfAPVKIx8FnHFhbfsMrrAAF9AExWa-brRqIz21HSw590ir37HmdeYZe0Zhx01eCg4mc67gT0adh7AG8V_ilzTn3F36KziNoVoo5ypfZWanHEnoD2UQd3_HZb-pV1KYN-UXoQIFHwW8-V4GfGfCo4RuE9ZbqZuxO0yek1Mosc5CLvKRUXEYrFmMJiUF0sz2P8UoVpg' alt='Coast guard vessels in contested East China Sea waters (illustrative)' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Triggering remarks: Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi told Japan’s parliament on November 7 that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could prompt a Japanese military response, a comment that Beijing says helped precipitate the recent patrols.</li><li>Drone activity: Chinese military drones were reported flying past outlying Japanese territory around the same period, adding an aerial dimension to the maritime activity and heightening Tokyo’s security concerns.</li><li>Ship formation: Chinese coast guard vessels travelled in a coordinated formation during the passage, which Beijing framed as enforcement of maritime rights and signals a more assertive policing posture at sea.</li><li>Diplomatic difficulty: Financial Times reporting says officials on both sides warn there is no straightforward diplomatic route to quickly de‑escalate the dispute, suggesting tensions may persist beyond the immediate incident.</li></ul><blockquote>Rights enforcement patrol - China coast guard</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Beijing / China Coast Guard: The coast guard described the passage as a &#x27;rights enforcement patrol&#x27; asserting what Beijing says are its maritime rights in the area.
