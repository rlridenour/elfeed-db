<p id="p2">Today, Apple announced its 2025 Q4 earnings, posting quarterly revenue of $102.5 billion, an 8% increase over the same quarter last year.</p>
<p id="p3"><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple CEO Tim Cook had this to say of the results</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  Today, Apple is very proud to report a September quarter revenue record of $102.5 billion, including a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and an all-time revenue record for Services. In September, we were thrilled to launch our best iPhone lineup ever, including iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, and iPhone Air. In addition, we launched the fantastic AirPods Pro 3 and the all-new Apple Watch lineup. When combined with the recently announced MacBook Pro and iPad Pro with the powerhouse M5 chip, we are excited to be sharing our most extraordinary lineup of products as we head into the holiday season.

<p id="p5">As CFO Kevan Parekh noted in Apple&rsquo;s press release, fiscal 2025 was a record year for revenue, coming in at $416 billion, which also represented a double-digit increase in earnings per share. Apple&rsquo;s board of directors also approved a $0.26/share dividend for shareholders of record as of November 10, 2025, which will be paid on November 13.</p>
<p id="p6">The results beat analyst expectations, and the outlook for the company looks good with Cook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">telling CNBC</a> that earnings in the next quarter should grow 10-12% over the same quarter the year prior. Cook attributed the growth outlook to the iPhone 17 line of mobile phones.</p>
<p id="p7">Here&rsquo;s the breakdown of earnings by category versus estimates, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to CNBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote8">
<ul><li><strong>iPhone revenue</strong>: $49.03 billion vs. $50.19 billion estimated &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Mac&nbsp;revenue</strong>:&nbsp;$8.73 billion vs. $8.59 billion estimated &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>iPad&nbsp;revenue</strong>:&nbsp;$6.95 billion vs. $6.98 billion estimated &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Other Products&nbsp;revenue</strong>:&nbsp;$9.01 billion vs. $8.49 billion estimated &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Services&nbsp;revenue</strong>:&nbsp;$28.75 billion vs. $28.17 billion estimated</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p id="p9"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to CNBC</a>, Apple&rsquo;s gross margin exceeded expectations at 47.2%, too.</p>
<p id="p10">Despite multiple challenges from tariffs to antitrust suits to regulation, the continued popularity of the iPhone continues to drive Apple&rsquo;s success. With the iPhone 17 line only available for a short part of the end of Q4&nbsp;2025, it will be interesting to see if it continues to drive Q1&nbsp;2026 earnings and whether Apple releases any new products that add to its earnings momentum.</p>
