<p>Storm Claudia struck parts of southern Portugal and moved northeast to the UK this weekend, killing three people in Portugal and unleashing widespread flooding across England and Wales. Authorities declared a major incident in Monmouth, south‑east Wales, after heavy rain and rising rivers forced people from their homes and prompted emergency responses. Portuguese officials said storm conditions caused fatal incidents including a tree falling at a campsite, while UK forecasters warned of plunging temperatures and continued flood warnings as clean-up begins.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eSN2-fPp0JyxKJGS6y0sg0KJGZ2dwW51KRghCwfKiGvbwu9kcUfdyabCiZiEaYDdtSYCUJwFZLh94bF25IAbKr4nzd0iHSVbIHWBFajX4XbXNlSBGaG9zxJGTSoikf2Q1dypbkbnF9NPM8S3s_wWZDYIZwqdif7Ipp1hj_BIOfsuLVCEtlfwtKai-EFpGEuyYjNXm3O0p1LZV6Vj0fI44zFRKAfspiUvA5txOHoGH5oXT_O5eysA5h8Vbw' alt='Nearly 12 centimetres of rain fell in south‑east Wales overnight.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Rain totals: Nearly 12 centimetres of rain fell in south‑east Wales overnight, significantly worsening local flooding and runoff.</li><li>Portuguese casualties: Southern Portugal recorded three storm‑related deaths, including an 85‑year‑old woman killed when a tree fell on a campsite, and authorities reported multiple injuries.</li><li>Ongoing warnings: Flood warnings remained in place across parts of England and Wales while emergency services continued clean‑up and recovery operations amid forecasts of cold, icy conditions.</li><li>Local response: Monmouth&#x27;s major incident declaration mobilised multi‑agency teams to coordinate evacuations and support residents displaced by rapidly rising water levels.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Monmouth emergency services: Local authorities declared a major incident to coordinate rescues, evacuations and protect residents as floodwaters rose rapidly in the town.
