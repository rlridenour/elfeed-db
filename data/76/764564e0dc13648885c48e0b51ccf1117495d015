<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the idea of the creative act and how it inspires joy in humans. I recently watched a documentary about a group of jazz musicians who were lamenting how no one is really willing to pay them what they&#8217;re worth. Club owners barely compensate these musicians, so why don’t they just take jobs digging ditches or doing something else more stable? I think the answer lies in the joy of creation.</p>



<p>As humans, I believe when we are creating, we are being our most natural selves. That act brings with it a high, and for jazz musicians, whose craft is rooted in real-time improvisation, they get to live in that high on a regular basis. It’s almost like the market has figured that out without really naming it. It knows these musicians will take less, because the non-monetary compensation of creating in front of an audience is just that powerful. It’s not just about the money—it’s about the act and the sharing of it.</p>



<p>That really resonates with me. I naturally gravitate toward anything that lets me express creative energy—whether that’s making music, building furniture, or what I create as MacSparky. My frustration with the administrative side of MacSparky probably reflects that pull toward the creative parts. I’ve lived this trade-off before. When I used to play jazz for money, I often accepted gigs that didn’t pay much because I just wanted to play. The same logic often shows up in how I price MacSparky products: I don’t optimize for maximum profit. I want to earn enough to be able to keep going, but I also want to get the content “out there”. I want the ideas to spread. I want to share what I’ve made.</p>



<p>I’m also aware of how fortunate I am to have structured a life where I get to live in that creative space most of the time. That didn’t happen by accident. I made conscious and unconscious choices to get here. If I had gone full throttle into being a high-powered attorney, sure, I’d be making more money. But would I get the same high? Not likely.</p>



<p>This reflection also helps me clarify why I’m so resistant to using artificial intelligence for the actual work of creating. I see AI as an incredibly useful assistant, especially for administrative things, but when it comes to the core act of making something, I want that to come from me. Because that’s the joy. That’s the whole point.</p>
