<p>President Trump carried out the traditional US Thanksgiving turkey pardon at the White House, sparing two birds named Waddle and Gobble during a televised ceremony ahead of the holiday. While the event is usually lighthearted, he used parts of his remarks to criticize Democrats, including prominent figures such as Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, and to revisit disputes involving former president Joe Biden and his son. At one point, he joked that the turkeys should instead be named after Democratic leaders and quipped that he &quot;would never&quot; extend them clemency, blending seasonal pageantry with partisan commentary. The pardoned birds will be spared from the Thanksgiving table in keeping with a long-running White House custom that symbolically marks the start of the US holiday season.</p><img src='' alt='President Trump stands beside Waddle and Gobble during the White House Thanksgiving turkey pardon ceremony.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ceremony setting: The turkey pardon took place on the White House grounds in front of an audience and cameras, continuing its role as a nationally broadcast moment ahead of Thanksgiving dinner celebrations across the United States.</li><li>Birds&#x27; future: After the ceremony, Waddle and Gobble are expected to live out their lives instead of being served as part of a Thanksgiving meal, aligning with recent practice for pardoned turkeys.</li><li>Partisan jokes: President Trump joked about naming the birds Chuck and Nancy, after Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, before adding that he would not grant pardons to those namesakes, drawing a clear political line during the ritual.</li><li>El Salvador reference: He also joked about sending the turkeys to a high-security prison in El Salvador that has been used to hold migrants deported from the United States, linking the light ceremony to his administration&#x27;s broader migration policies.</li><li>Economic boasts: In his remarks, the President folded in claims about strong economic performance under his leadership, including assertions about US growth and jobs, even though the event’s official purpose was the holiday pardon of the birds.</li></ul><blockquote>I would never pardon those names, frankly. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He blended the pardons with partisan jokes about Democratic leaders and references to former president Joe Biden and his son, using the normally ceremonial appearance to reiterate arguments he has made in political speeches.
