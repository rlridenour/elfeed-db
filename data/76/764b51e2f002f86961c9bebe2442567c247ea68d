         <p>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More here:

<p>Today I learn from PizzaTorque about how Emacs is used for programming
in the field of data science. We discuss the kind of infrastructure
Emacs has for dealing with various programming languages and how the
experience is. Emacs as a note-taking tool is also something we
consider. Then the discussion shifts to linguistics and relevant
cultural as well as political considerations. We frequently draw
parallels with Emacs. After that we talk about Emacs more in terms of
lifestyle and art, commenting on how it helps us develop certain
qualities that apply to other parts of our life. We conclude with a
conversation on community and an individual’s outlook, tying it all
together.</p>

<p>PizzaTorque does video streams on programming-related topics, while
using Emacs. Here is the YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pizzatorque">https://www.youtube.com/@pizzatorque</a>.</p>
