<p>Note to self, I needed to migrate/re-encrypt someone's password store (aka pass). Straightforward:</p>
<p>Get the new key, probably already in gpg key chain. Try listing it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">gpg --list-keys
</code></pre>
<p>To re-encrypt, <code>pass init</code> with new key is enough. It'll prompt for old pass key.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">cd path/to/.password-store
pass init NEW-GPG-KEY
</code></pre>
