         <p>On Saturday, the 15th of March 2025, at 14:00 o’clock of time zone
Europe/Athens, I will do a live stream where I will answer every
question posted in the chat. The idea is to cover any of the topics I
already write/talk about on my website, including Emacs, free
software, politics, philosophy, and everyday affairs.</p>

<p>I will answer every question from top to bottom to the best of my
abilities and will not give any of those formulaic non-answers.</p>

<p>The plan is to do a minimum of two hours, but may extend it for at
least one or two more hours depending on the participation in the
chat. My electricity should be okay because the weather forecast shows
a clear day with fairly warm temperatures (finally!).</p>

<p>The event will be recorded, so no worries if you cannot make it live.</p>

<p>Talk to all of you soon!</p>
