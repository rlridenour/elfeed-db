<p>
Álvaro Ramírez, whom I&rsquo;ve a written a lot about lately because of his excellent <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-for-ios">Journelly app</a>, just announced that an Emacs patch of his has been accepted and merged into Master. That sort of thing happens everyday, of course, but Ramírez&rsquo;s contribution is unique because it started life as a macOS specific capability. The FSF&rsquo;s way of punishing apostates who use macOS or other &ldquo;non-free&rdquo; software is to refuse to accept patches to Emacs that are specific to such software.
</p>
<p>
Because of this, Ramírez didn&rsquo;t have much hope of having his patch accepted but he persevered nonetheless and, thankfully, it was accepted. He rewrote his patch to be a framework that would work on any OS if the necessary support modules were provided.
</p>
<p>
The patch, as originally conceived, was <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-send-to-aka-macos-sharing-merged-upstream">an Emacs interface to the the macOS share functionality</a>. As accepted, the framework will do the same thing in any system that provides the necessary interface modules.

Like Ramírez, I&rsquo;m grateful that Eli Zaretskii and Steven Kangas recognized the value of his contribution and worked to make it acceptable to the wider Emacs community. It&rsquo;s not a groundbreaking change but it will make it a bit easier for us to meet our goal of being able to stay in Emacs as much as possible.

I&rsquo;m not sure, and Ramírez doesn&rsquo;t say, when his changes will appear. They&rsquo;ve been merged into Master but I don&rsquo;t know if that means they&rsquo;ll appear in Emacs 30.2 or if we&rsquo;ll have to wait to Emacs 31. Regardless, it&rsquo;s a nice change and will make all our lives a bit nicer regardless of which operating system we&rsquo;re using.</p>
