Just in case you haven&rsquo;t heard enough whining about Emacs not having &ldquo;modern&rdquo; keybindings, arthurno1 over at the Emacs subreddit has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1lacdva/rebinding_emacs_to_modern_shortcuts/">a long post</a> on possible ways to reconfigure Emacs to get them. It&rsquo;s an interesting post because arthurno1 actually considers ways to solve the problem rather than just complaining that Emacs keybindings aren&rsquo;t what he&rsquo;s used to<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.

The problem turns out to be more difficult than you might think. It probably explains why there isn&rsquo;t a set of &ldquo;keybinding themes&rdquo; similar to the display themes that we have.

I should be more sympathetic to those wanting Emacs to use conventional keybindings. After all, I&rsquo;ve admitted several times that I have a hard time using multiple keybindings. But when I thought about it, I realized my problem is with using multiple keybindings for they same type of application. For example, I would have a hard time using both Emacs and Vim, even though I know them both well because my muscle memory would cause me to use the wrong binding for a given operation. I have no problem using different keybindings for different apps. So, for example, it doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> for search in Emacs and <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> for the same operation in Safari. Of course, since I mostly live in Emacs, even different keybindings among applications isn&rsquo;t much of a problem.

I suspect, though, that a lot of this yearning for &ldquo;modern&rdquo; keybindings really means, &ldquo;I want it to be like VS Code&rdquo; or whatever other editor they&rsquo;re used to. For those people, I can do no better than to <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/I/If-you-want-X--you-know-where-to-find-it-.html">channel Dennis Ritchie</a>: If you want VS Code, you know where to find it.

Actually, it&rsquo;s not clear if arthurno1 himself wants a different set of keybindings or if he&rsquo;s just setting out to solve the problem.
