<p>The United States has formally labeled Venezuela’s so‑called Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization, adding terrorism-related sanctions to earlier US accusations that President Nicolás Maduro and senior officials are involved in narcotics trafficking through this network. The term refers to an alleged criminal structure embedded in Venezuela’s security forces, but several analysts and regional leaders question whether it exists as a coherent cartel rather than a shorthand for corruption by individual officials. President Trump’s administration portrays the move as part of its campaign against “narcoterrorism” and has linked it to ongoing strikes on small boats off Venezuela’s coast that US officials say are used for drug trafficking. Venezuelan authorities, meanwhile, denounce the terror label as a “ridiculous lie” and argue Washington is using drug and terror allegations as a pretext to weaken or remove Maduro’s government.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/YAPwEsxySmaH6-BxCfr4a5j6I8JZB1EwQrQbVdQe__veEoRPX0VDYU5ucZRNPXNSi-A1MpO8oeCN-xnHrJCQLOxv_kaNTk-PU1nAoXL07zvgRCIZl2ts_cjv1bsJpGUiw9cn-X_jRD5FdPEYAE8ONF-wMuOFWjWIPlkBG6rp4Q' alt='Ships and coastal infrastructure near Venezuela, as the US intensifies operations against alleged narcotics trafficking networks linked to Venezuelan officials.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Sanctions expansion: The terrorist designation allows Washington to impose additional financial and immigration restrictions beyond existing narcotics charges, targeting anyone who provides material support to the alleged network.</li><li>Alleged leadership: US officials have long asserted that President Maduro and more than a dozen current or former Venezuelan officials help direct Cartel de los Soles, building on a 2020 US indictment that accused them of orchestrating large-scale cocaine shipments.</li><li>Caribbean operations: In the two months leading up to the designation, US airstrikes on small boats off Venezuela’s coast—described by the Pentagon as anti‑“narcoterrorism” actions—reportedly killed around 80 people, further raising tensions with Caracas.</li><li>Name origin: The label “Cartel de los Soles” dates back to the 1990s, when media used it to describe alleged corruption among Venezuelan military officers whose epaulettes bore sun-shaped insignia rather than to a formally constituted cartel.</li><li>Regime-change concerns: Critics inside and outside Venezuela argue the terror listing, combined with past US recognition of opposition figure Juan Guaidó as interim leader, suggests Washington’s focus is toppling Maduro rather than narrowly tackling drug trafficking.</li></ul><blockquote>The Trump administration officially declared a Venezuelan group called “Cartel de los Soles” a terrorist organisation on Monday, despite doubts over its existence - Firstpost staff, summarizing critics’ view</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US government: US officials describe Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization woven into Venezuela’s security forces and say the designation strengthens tools to combat narcotics trafficking tied to Maduro and his circle.
