<p>Some of you will recall the days of having to photocopy journal articles out of unwieldy bound volumes you pulled off the shelf in the lower levels of your university library. Now, in the era of PDFs and digital books, access to academic materials is easier than ever.</p>
<p>But on what do you read those materials?</p>
<p>Are you using your computer or a tablet? If so, what app do you use to read and annotate the materials? Are you happy with it?</p>
<p>Are you instead using an e-reader? Which one? Why?</p>
<p>Let us know. Thanks!</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/02/28/academic-equipment-e-readers-reading-apps/">Academic Equipment: E-Readers & Reading Apps</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
