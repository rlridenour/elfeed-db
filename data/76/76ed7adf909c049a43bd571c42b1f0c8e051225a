For now, rumors have settled on the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/iphone-18-pro-leak-smaller-dynamic-island/">featuring a smaller Dynamic Island</a>, and now a leaker has revealed its alleged size.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/iPhone-18-Pro-Dynamic-Island-Ice-Universe.jpg" alt="" width="1380" height="776" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1033389" /><em>iPhone 18 Pro with a smaller Dynamic Island (mockup via <a href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/2014500620347285549">Ice Universe</a>)</em></div><br/>
The account "Ice Universe" today <a href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/2014500620347285549">claimed</a> the Dynamic Island cutout on the iPhone 18 Pro models will be approximately 35% narrower than it is on the iPhone 17 Pro models. Specifically, they said it will have a width of around 13.5mm, down from around 20.7mm, and they shared the mockup image above to show what it would look like.<br/>
<br/>
These measurements refer to the default size of the Dynamic Island while the iPhone screen is turned on, and this includes the extra black pixels that surround the actual cutouts for Face ID sensors and the front camera. While showing Live Activities and other information, the Dynamic Island temporarily becomes wider. <br/>
<br/>
An earlier report from <em>The Information</em> indicated that the iPhone 18 Pro models will feature under-screen Face ID. As a result, the publication said the devices would have only a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/">hole-punch front camera in the top-left corner of the screen</a>, rather than the current pill-shaped cutout for the front camera and Face ID sensors. However, the latest word is that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/iphone-18-pro-leak-smaller-dynamic-island/">only Face ID's flood illuminator will be moved under the screen</a> this year, meaning that Apple will only be able to shrink the pill-shaped cutout rather than remove it entirely.<br/>
<br/>
According to display industry expert Ross Young, who has a very good track record, the smaller Dynamic Island will <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/2013829835856965977">last through at least 2027</a>. So, it could take at least a few more years until the iPhone finally gets a truly seamless display.<br/>
<br/>
"Ice Universe" has leaked some accurate iPhone dimensions in the past, giving them credibility, but they do not have a perfect track record.<br/>

Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 18 Pro models in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ice-universe/">Ice Universe</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/iphone-18-pro-alleged-dynamic-island-size/">iPhone 18 Pro: Leaker Reveals Alleged Size of Smaller Dynamic Island</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pro-leaker-reveals-alleged-size-of-smaller-dynamic-island.2476483/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
