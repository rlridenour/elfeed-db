</ul><h1>Robo Seasoning</h1><p><strong>How to use your COSPRO Electric Salt and Pepper Grinders</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove from packaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the easy top-loading design to fill with Himalayan salt, pepper, kosher salt, or whatever you like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select your desired level of coarseness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enjoy the simple, one-button automation and the convenient wireless charging base</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become obsessed with further improving your kitchen with technological innovations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buy many more appliances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you run out of appliances to buy, build your own: SaltBot, the world’s first fully automated, mobile salting robot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never fear the threat of an under-seasoned meal again. SaltBot has it taken care of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wake with a start one night to find SaltBot standing over you in the dark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stammer something inadequate when SaltBot asks, in its robot voice, “Master, what does it mean to love?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a new robot: the PepperBride.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch as the two of them work in perfect harmony in the kitchen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to ignore the strange sounds that come from the guest room where they stay at night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add further appendages to both SaltBot and PepperBride for performing kitchen tasks beyond seasoning meals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listen as the night sounds become even stranger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the two extra helpers in the kitchen, take on more and more ambitious culinary projects. For example: squab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch with morbid fascination as SaltBot and PepperBride work to break down the squab. You know they’re robots and all, but doesn’t it sort of look like they’re enjoying this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the little whiteboard where you write the menu for the week and find your plans erased. In their place, on every day of the week, it’s squab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the fridge to find it packed with squab that you didn’t buy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eat squab at every meal, even breakfast, for many days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, when you’ve worked through the squab in the fridge, send SaltBot and PepperBride to get more squab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While they’re away, have the locks changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they return, listen to them jiggle the door for nearly three hours before giving up and going somewhere else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go back to using your COSPRO Electric Salt and Pepper Grinders. They’re the only seasoning-related innovations you need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to ignore the concerning reports about the city’s pigeon population.</p>
</li>
