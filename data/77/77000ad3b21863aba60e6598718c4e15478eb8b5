<p>Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro was transferred from house arrest to a federal police jail after authorities found that his electronic ankle monitor had been deliberately damaged with a soldering tool while he awaited the start of a long prison sentence for earlier convictions. In a custody hearing on Sunday, Bolsonaro told a judge he experienced paranoia, hallucinations and a nervous breakdown linked to changes in psychiatric medication, and claimed he had no intention of escaping or fully removing the device. Prosecutors and prison officials, however, said the equipment showed clear signs of tampering, which by law is grounds for revoking electronic monitoring and placing a defendant in custody. The case adds a new legal complication for the former leader and underscores how Brazil’s justice system continues to handle the fallout from his turbulent presidency through institutional and judicial channels rather than through the streets.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/xN3prr5RJYtQm6VpV8qygpaR0AcinUnxGvYipb7QgKAZ771zGQVdKvaVqT-w0vQJmSfxARSfMFOstEGUztLY63YEIwsMeJywbuPBJXpm2fz-bKQsxP6A4QC6tN7UGwrRe5b8GSpS2GslD78LL_ejdF8N4dHE1wS7Ek9yWahJrfcDK2hLWzgNb8287Py1zzvSrnmDfv1aaQYhD_pmMv4' alt='The damaged electronic ankle monitor assigned to former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, shown in video released by penitentiary authorities.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Monitoring violation: Video and photos released by the Federal District’s penitentiary administration show the plastic casing of Bolsonaro’s ankle monitor cut open and charred in a way experts say is consistent with the use of a soldering iron or similar heated metal tool.</li><li>Medication explanation: Bolsonaro told the judge that medication he uses for chronic hiccups and psychiatric treatment allegedly triggered intense anxiety and suspicions that his device was a bomb, which he cited as the reason he tried to open it.</li><li>Denial of escape plan: In court Bolsonaro insisted that he remained inside his residence and said he never tried to flee or fully remove the device, arguing that his actions were impulsive and confined to inspecting the monitor.</li><li>Legal framework: Under Brazilian law, tampering with court-ordered electronic monitoring can be treated as noncompliance with judicial conditions, allowing judges to swap house arrest for incarceration while they assess whether additional charges or penalties are warranted.</li><li>Public interest: The incident has drawn intense coverage in Brazilian and international media, as it intersects questions about mental health, accountability of former leaders and the reliability of electronic surveillance tools in modern justice systems.</li></ul><blockquote>I had a breakdown, I lost my sense of reality. - Jair Bolsonaro</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Jair Bolsonaro: Bolsonaro told the judge he felt paranoid and hallucinated that the ankle device might explode, saying his altered mental state from medication led him to open the monitor without any plan to flee house arrest.
