Both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> have had fairly recent updates, and there are quite a few similarities between them that might leave you wondering which one is the best to meet your needs. In our latest video, we go over the similarities and differences, and the use cases that might make you choose one over another.<br/>

The M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;599, while the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is &#36;999, so there's a notable difference in terms of cost. There are 11-inch and 13-inch size options for both models, and performance is not too far off between them.<br/>
<br/>
With the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, you essentially get an improved display, a faster chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> support, better audio, ProRes video recording, and the option to use the higher-end keyboard case. There are few things you can do on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> that stress the M3 chip, and most people won't notice the difference in performance from M3 to M4 for day to day tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Where you might see a small difference is apps that are system intensive, like Final Cut Pro or Photoshop, but both handle those tasks just fine. It's actually the display that's the biggest differentiating factor. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has an OLED display that's much brighter, supports HDR, offers ProMotion, and has deeper blacks and more vivid colors. If you're doing something where color is a factor, or if display quality is important, that's where you would want to consider the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
