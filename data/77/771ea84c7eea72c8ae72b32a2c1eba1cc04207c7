<p>TikTok finalized an agreement to create a new U.S. unit backed by mostly American investors, a structure designed to avert a renewed shutdown risk and end years of uncertainty around a U.S. ban threat. The arrangement gives U.S. investors majority control while leaving ByteDance with just under a 20% stake, and it received sign-off from both Washington and Beijing, according to multiple reports. The deal follows President Trump’s executive order granting a 120-day pause on enforcing the federal ban deadline, keeping the app available for roughly 170 million U.S. users while negotiations concluded.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SyZ3MSJC_FO1f-Y2ePO1mewbcr0nPp3qDoT0ttn2PHGOxlBAwVjLvxCFBWzOqf9VEwm7SMY8440iRKX_dHx3MJJjY7WTO2dDF0UUyezMhHGb-YBse7Od1MBwU6OZTttcTiyJcEJBx4nR6ty1uicV37_WJXvZtQnR3hvP0Ha4odHB0s9nH3bGmQDd_zyMIY1Y7PJX0UgDrkNgUaBOQlb4NEyKGjpOgC7Yb3vLo_aWn-R4' alt='Illustrative photo tied to coverage of the U.S.-TikTok negotiations and deal to create a U.S. unit.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Backers lineup: The investor group includes Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX (described as a UAE state-owned AI-focused fund), alongside Susquehanna, Dragoneer, DFO and Michael Dell’s family office, according to reporting on the deal structure.</li><li>Safeguards promised: TikTok said the new U.S. app will operate with safeguards covering data protections, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurances for U.S. users.</li><li>Leadership structure: Adam Presser will serve as CEO of the new venture, working with a seven-member board that is majority American and includes TikTok CEO Shou Chew.</li><li>Price still hazy: People familiar with the deal said it was unclear how much ByteDance received, while Vice President JD Vance previously indicated a valuation of roughly $14 billion for the U.S. unit.</li><li>Algorithm question: Several outlets said control of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm remained an unresolved or unclear point in the final arrangement.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>TikTok: TikTok framed the new U.S. venture as a way to keep the service running while adding national-security safeguards around data, software, content moderation and the algorithm.
