<p>President Trump announced a 10% increase in U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods after a provincial Ontario advertisement that quoted Ronald Reagan aired in the United States, which the President called a &quot;fraud&quot; and said misrepresented Reagan&#x27;s views; he made the announcement on social media and halted bilateral trade talks amid the dispute . The Ontario government said it would pull the ad after the weekend but it ran during the World Series, a detail that further irritated the White House; Canadian leaders including Prime Minister Mark Carney and Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc have since worked to calm the situation and restart talks . The move adds to existing U.S. trade measures imposed earlier this year and creates new uncertainty for exporters and negotiators on both sides of the border .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/AU7Q-_UhESAG6_-mAhmmUnWR3dDFT8T-_VkNO8FYvoDZ6w_-rs2M5s9R_JKRtU8NLpU-igfKlYPNbLNWDTMd07oUB0Lbswrpiv0vkjQAhG69tiT5xV9N-QljC4_nwiKVW4iMKYt4k_BP2rl61e_TkUtVNsBz2A7T_TIzvu8KSUE9qTfYq3hdWsLtPonJJgoW47A23-yMLonyaeyr6qpupTe-' alt='President Trump speaking on Air Force One before arriving in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Saturday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Pre-existing tariffs: Earlier this year the administration imposed levies on Canadian steel and aluminum (25%), later expanding tariffs to a broader set of goods, a background that raises stakes for the new 10% hike .</li><li>Legal backdrop: The White House&#x27;s broad tariff authority is facing a Supreme Court review set for November, a legal development that observers say could determine the scope of Washington&#x27;s trade powers .</li><li>Diplomatic strain: National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett described negotiations as &quot;not very collegial,&quot; and Mark Carney reportedly urged Ontario to pull the ad to help restart trade talks .</li><li>Scope uncertainty: Media reports say Washington did not specify which product lines the extra 10% would target, leaving exporters and supply-chain managers unsure about immediate effects .</li></ul><blockquote>Ronald Reagan LOVED Tariffs for purposes of National Security and the Economy, but Canada said he didn’t! - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump / White House: The advertisement was a &quot;fraud&quot; that misrepresented Ronald Reagan and justified increasing tariffs and pausing talks, a position the president posted on his social platform and defended publicly .
