The servers designed for Apple's Private Cloud Compute system have started shipping from the 250,000-square-foot Houston site months earlier than planned. Apple Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan confirmed the acceleration in a statement provided to <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/apple-building-american-made-ai-servers-ahead-schedule-new-houston-facility-answering-trump-call"><em>Fox Business</em></a>:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>We are thrilled to be shipping American-made advanced servers from our Houston facility. As part of our &#36;600 billion commitment to the United States, these servers will be installed in our data centers and play a key role in powering Apple Intelligence with Private Cloud Compute. Our teams have done an incredible job accelerating work to get the new Houston factory up and running ahead of schedule, and we plan to continue expanding the facility to increase production next year.</blockquote><br/>

Private Cloud Compute is the architecture Apple uses to offload certain <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> computations from devices to the cloud, while preserving the on-device privacy model that Apple says is core to its AI system. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> also posted on X about the news:<br/>
