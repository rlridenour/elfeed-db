Earlier this month, the <em>Financial Times</em> reported that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/report-tim-cook-to-step-down-as-soon-as-next-year/">preparing for Tim Cook to step down as CEO of the company "as soon as next year</a>."<br/>

While the report said that Apple is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, it went on to explain that an announcement early in the year would allow for a smooth leadership transition, ahead of Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June and iPhone event in September.<br/>
<br/>
However, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said he would be "shocked" if Cook steps down between late January and June next year.<br/>
<br/>
"Based on everything I've learned in recent weeks, I don't believe a departure by the middle of next year is likely," said Gurman, <a href="tps://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-23/apple-ios-27-snow-leopard-like-quality-focus-ai-features-tim-cook-retirement-mibq7jv8">in his <em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>. "In fact, I would be shocked if Cook steps down in the time frame outlined by the FT."<br/>
<br/>
There have been "few signs internally" that Cook is about to step down, he added.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman described the <em>Financial Times</em> report as "premature" and "simply false."<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/john-ternus/">John Ternus</a>, is widely viewed as Cook's most likely successor whenever the time comes.<br/>
<br/>
Cook, who turned 65 this year, has been Apple's CEO since August 2011.<br/>
