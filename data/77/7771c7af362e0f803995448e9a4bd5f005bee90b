<p>The numbers 1-7 are disposed among the regions in this figure such that each of the circular sets yields the same sum. This makes it a &#8220;magic Venn diagram,&#8221; a concept that occurred to mathematician David Robinson while teaching a course in mathematical logic at the University of West Georgia. <a href="https://reference-global.com/article/10.2478/rmm-2025-0010">His article</a> appears in the December 2025 issue of <em>Recreational Mathematics Magazine</em>.</p>
