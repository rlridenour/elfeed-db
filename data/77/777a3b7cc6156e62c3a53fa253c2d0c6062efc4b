<p>&#8220;One thing that has become clear over the course of many discussions is that almost every thoughtful reader will find something to object to in the document.&#8221;<span id="more-53967"></span></p>
<p>That is from the preface to &#8220;Good Practices for Improving Representation in Philosophy Departments,&#8221; a guide to help philosophers &#8220;create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all—including women, people of color, disabled people, non-native English speakers, first-generation college students, those with serious economic needs or from developing countries, LBGTQ+ people, and people with political or religious views that are underrepresented in the discipline, amongst others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Put together by the Demographics in Philosophy / Women in Philosophy project and published in the latest issue of <a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/950518C1-3421-484C-8153-CDA6ED737182/BlackExperienceV24n2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>APA Studies on Philosophy and the Black Experience</em></a> (vol. 24, no. 2, p.8), the report &#8220;is the compromise result of many hands&#8221; over many years of development and feedback (<a href="https://dailynous.com/2022/05/09/seeking-feedback-on-good-practices-guide-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for example</a>).</p>
<p>The authors &#8220;hope that philosophers who are broadly supportive of diversity and inclusion will find value in it even if those compromises haven’t all landed exactly where they prefer.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Amy Ferrer, the executive director of the American Philosophical Association, has written in to clarify that while the &#8220;Good Practices for Improving Representation in Philosophy Departments&#8221; guide was published by the APA in one of its newsletters, it&#8217;s a Diversity in Philosophy/Women in Philosophy guidance document. It is not an official APA guide, nor has it been officially endorsed by the APA board of officers. (Language indicating otherwise in the original version of this post has been changed to avoid misleading readers about this.)</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/05/27/apa-publishes-good-practices-for-improving-representation-in-philosophy-departments/">APA Publishes “Good Practices for Improving Representation in Philosophy Departments” (updated)</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
