<p>The European Commission has imposed a €120 million (about $140 million) fine on Elon Musk’s social media platform X for breaching transparency obligations under the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), marking the first non-compliance penalty under the law’s content rules. EU investigators found that X’s paid blue checkmark system allowed users to buy verification badges without meaningful identity checks, which the Commission said misled people about account authenticity and increased exposure to scams and impersonation. Brussels also concluded that X did not provide an adequate public archive of advertisements and failed to give researchers the required access to public platform data, both of which are mandated by the DSA’s transparency standards. The decision has triggered sharp criticism from senior US officials, who describe the move as an attack on American tech companies and free expression online, while EU leaders insist the case is about consumer protection and transparency rather than content censorship.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/IPwmXzkLVgo2ot5VQ53YUcjIUXneEGw1KSz3Ckj8MNJHpA4t8b2Wpiy8YhUMAGhpOQSnZCZUTpqK2hyIWQ61OSVo3fSM8X2OWraDIyBwNg6b' alt='Teenagers use their phones in front of an X logo, symbolizing the platform at the center of the EU’s landmark Digital Services Act enforcement case.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>First DSA enforcement: This is the first formal non-compliance ruling and financial penalty issued under the EU’s Digital Services Act for how a major platform handles content-related transparency, making it a precedent for future cases involving other large online services.</li><li>Ongoing X investigations: X remains under separate EU investigations for issues including illegal content, disinformation and protection of minors, meaning Friday’s transparency fine does not close the wider DSA probes into the platform’s operations.</li><li>Scope of DSA scrutiny: The European Commission says that out of ten large platforms currently under formal DSA investigation, only three are US-based firms, countering accusations that Brussels is systematically singling out American tech companies.</li><li>Future Big Tech cases: EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen said the Commission plans to conclude several additional DSA cases &quot;in the coming months&quot; and warned that other online platforms may also face non-compliance decisions and fines if they fail to adjust their systems.</li><li>Blue check risks: The Commission found that X’s post‑2022 changes to its blue badge allowed any paying user to appear &quot;verified&quot; without real identity checks, which EU officials said facilitates impersonation fraud and other malicious manipulation attempts targeting ordinary users.</li></ul><blockquote>This decision is about the transparency of X - Henna Virkkunen, EU tech chief</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Commission: The Commission argues that X’s design and data practices violated DSA transparency rules, stressing that the case concerns user protection and openness about ads and platform systems rather than any attempt to censor speech or target a specific country’s companies.
