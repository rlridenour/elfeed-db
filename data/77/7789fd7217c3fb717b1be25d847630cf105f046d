Google today used Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> failure to lure customers to the upcoming Pixel 10 series, sharing an ad that calls out the delayed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality.<br/>

With the spot, Google is shaming Apple for the misstep, suggesting Apple users should purchase a Pixel 10 smartphone instead.<blockquote>If you buy a new phone because of a feature that's coming soon...<br/>
<br/>
But it's been coming soon for a full year...<br/>
<br/>
You could change your definition of soon. Or you could just change your phone.</blockquote>At WWDC 2024, Apple showed off personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features powered by &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;. When the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models launched, Apple used those &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features to promote the new smartphones, and listed the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality as coming soon.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was not able to deliver personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality as planned, and earlier this year said that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">would be delayed until 2026</a>. Apple is now on track to release &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/">in spring 2026</a>, a year after it was supposed to launch. The delay has led to upset customers and even <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/apple-intelligence-siri-lawsuit/">class action lawsuits</a> for false advertising.<br/>
