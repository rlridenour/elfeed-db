<p id="p1">Earlier this year, Andrej Karpathy wrote <a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/finding-the-best-sleep-tracker/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an in-depth analysis of four sleep tracking methods</a> that Federico recently recommended I read. I&rsquo;m glad he did, Karpathy, an AI researcher who has worked at OpenAI and Tesla, took the kind of nerdy, data-driven approach that I love.</p>
<p id="p2">Over the course of two months, Karpathy plotted sleep tracking results from:</p>
<ul id="ul3"><li>an <a href="https://ouraring.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oura ring</a></li>
<li>a <a href="https://www.whoop.com/us/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whoop fitness band</a></li>
<li>an <a href="https://www.eightsleep.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">8Sleep Pod 4 Ultra</a> smart mattress cover</li>
<li>the Apple Watch running the app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoSleep</a></li>
</ul><p id="p4">Karpathy got <a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/finding-the-best-sleep-tracker/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best results from the Whoop band and Oura ring</a>, but just as interesting were how the data correlated to how he felt after a good night&rsquo;s sleep:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  &hellip;my sleep scores correlate strongly with the quality of work I am able to do that day. When my score is low, I lack agency, I lack courage, I lack creativity, I&rsquo;m simply tired. When my sleep score is high, I can power through anything. On my best days, I can sit down and work through 14 hours and barely notice the passage of time. It&rsquo;s not subtle.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">I recommend reading the entire post for all the details of how each tracking method compared on variety of metrics. I&rsquo;ve long been intrigued by the Whoop band and Oura ring as a companion to the Apple Watch. There&rsquo;s overlap between the devices, but Karpathy has planted a seed in my brain that may lead to my own multi-device experiments.</p>
