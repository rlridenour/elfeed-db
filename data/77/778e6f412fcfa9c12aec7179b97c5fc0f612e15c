iOS 26 breaks search functionality in the Calendar app for some iPhone users, according to comments from affected users across the <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/256142543">Apple Support Community</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1nioiuu/calendar_app_search_not_working/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://x.com/InvestOrTradeX/status/1957155791959720240">X</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/328748646935424/posts/666738573136428/">Facebook</a>, and other online discussion platforms.<br/>

The issue is affecting many iPhone models, ranging from the iPhone 13 mini to the iPhone 17 Pro, and it has not been fixed in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/apple-seeds-ios-26-1-beta-1/">first iOS 26.1 beta version</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Affected users attempt to search for an existing calendar event, but no results are found.<br/>
<br/>
The problem does not impact all iPhone users, and certain search phrases may still yield results, so it appears to be a bit of a hit-or-miss situation.<br/>
<br/>
The first complaints about the issue surfaced during iOS 26 beta testing, but the problem has gained more attention since the update was released last week.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's support representatives have informed customers that the company is aware of the issue and will be implementing a fix in a future software update, so keep your iPhone up to date. It is unclear if the fix will arrive in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/18/ios-26-0-1-coming-soon/">iOS 26.0.1</a> or iOS 26.1.<br/>
