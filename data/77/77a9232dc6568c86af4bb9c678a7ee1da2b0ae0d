<p>President Trump has released his administration’s National Security Strategy, outlining a foreign policy that shifts US focus toward the Western Hemisphere, boosts military posture in the Indo-Pacific, and downplays traditional security priorities in the Middle East. The document revives language associated with the 19th‑century Monroe Doctrine by stating that the United States will reassert its dominance in the Western Hemisphere and treat outside interference there as a concern, while framing the Middle East more as a region for investment and economic engagement than for large-scale military commitments. It warns that Europe faces potential &quot;civilizational erasure&quot; linked in part to mass migration and says Washington aims to &quot;help Europe correct its current trajectory,&quot; signalling a willingness to work with political forces there that support the administration’s approach to borders and culture. The strategy labels Iran the chief source of regional destabilization and calls Syria a &quot;potential problem,&quot; but it does not single out Russia for strong criticism, even as it calls for cultivating political resistance inside Europe to certain policies of existing governments and EU institutions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/tWf0Cl_c6TgafKNaJhfsPaGFJO4QzLL-Y2ysKVPth5q7biUG7RBcyyYxVbVUQ8yRxxg4R5Yr97EDMTb6fi6JfQELxBwJCsmcUfxiLnqSzwaNkzZmBFakKaj8OvKoY_p39AM26mhIgixhyqgZAeAaHP6cdjFXlMOhmPZ8NhWrI1SlKdMguTAsnfJ5ljs7PZ-S4zKPQl_lDaNvS81mQgFEAqvY6wWJUXBwxpSsIvirt0HFOzShWclzs3rHmQ' alt='President Donald Trump speaks at the White House as his administration unveils a new US National Security Strategy that has drawn strong reactions in Europe.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Middle East rethink: The strategy says the United States no longer needs to prioritise the Middle East for security reasons, reflecting reduced dependence on the region’s energy and an intent to pivot toward economic and defence partnerships instead of large troop deployments.</li><li>Europe-focused language: In addition to warning of &quot;civilisational erasure,&quot; the document says Washington wants to support European actors who favour stricter immigration controls and cultural preservation, while suggesting that current European leaders have taken a misguided path on these issues.</li><li>Iran and Syria framing: Iran is described as the principal destabilising force in its neighbourhood and a target for intensified US pressure, whereas Syria is portrayed as a place whose unresolved conflict and governance could create future security challenges if not carefully managed.</li><li>Russia treatment: While the plan sharply criticises some traditional US allies, it offers little direct condemnation of Russia, a contrast noted by several analysts who highlight that Moscow is not portrayed with the same level of concern as Iran or some non-state threats.</li><li>Indo-Pacific build-up: The strategy calls for strengthened US military capabilities in the Indo‑Pacific, positioning this vast region as a central arena for future power competition and cooperation, including with key partners like Japan and other regional allies.</li></ul><blockquote>Europe is experiencing what is perhaps the greatest migration wave in its history and, unless this trajectory is corrected, it faces the risk of civilizational erasure. - President Donald Trump (in the National Security Strategy document, as quoted by ABC News)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: The White House frames the document as the clearest expression yet of President Trump’s &quot;America First&quot; worldview, emphasising stronger borders, reduced emphasis on Middle Eastern conflicts, and a renewed assertion of US influence close to home in the Western Hemisphere and across the Indo‑Pacific.
