<p>Thailand’s military says it carried out airstrikes on Cambodian military positions along their disputed border on Monday after Thai troops came under fire in Ubon Ratchathani province, leaving at least one Thai soldier dead and several wounded. Cambodian officials accuse Thailand of instead launching pre‑dawn attacks on their positions after days of perceived provocations, and say their forces did not respond, highlighting how each side blames the other for breaking a ceasefire deal. The renewed fighting, involving Thai F‑16 jets striking targets across the frontier, threatens a fragile truce brokered in July by US President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim after a brief but intense conflict earlier this year over a decades‑old border dispute. Shelling and strikes have killed several people, including Cambodian civilians, and pushed thousands living near the frontier to leave their homes again, while regional and international actors urge both governments to return to restraint and dialogue.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/OLEgo-jjRCwMdZuYu6ba2fBHgs2-qLcPmz6Gi64H3SU8yupkOoAvb6-E27PPTD_Rsk1U644J9AAA79QQXIlKfBMQ4wwPexw5zSmM8zlJ-U9g' alt='People shelter in Buriram province, Thailand, after fresh Thai‑Cambodian border clashes forced residents to flee frontier areas.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Thai military account: The Royal Thai Army says clashes began Sunday when Cambodian troops allegedly opened fire on Thai soldiers in eastern Ubon Ratchathani, killing one and injuring between four and eight others before further attacks with artillery and drones on Anupong base prompted a request for air support.</li><li>Cambodian military stance: Cambodia’s defence ministry states that Thai forces launched attacks at two border locations using small arms, mortars and tanks after several days of &quot;provocative actions,&quot; and insists Cambodian troops did not retaliate or build up forces along the frontier as claimed by Bangkok.</li><li>Use of F‑16 jets: Royal Thai Air Force F‑16 fighter jets were deployed to hit what Thailand describes as Cambodian military targets, with officials saying the aim was to limit Cambodia’s capabilities to the minimum level needed to protect Thai national security and civilians.</li><li>Border communities displaced: Renewed shelling and air raids have driven tens of thousands of residents on both sides of the border into temporary shelters or away from the frontier, adding to the hundreds of thousands previously displaced during the July fighting.</li><li>Preah Vihear dispute roots: The current tensions centre on a long‑running disagreement over sections of the Thai‑Cambodian border dating back to maps drawn under French colonial rule, including areas around Cambodia’s Preah Vihear province that have periodically sparked armed clashes between the neighbours.</li></ul><blockquote>We urge both sides to exercise maximum restraint, maintain open channels of communication and make full use of the mechanisms in place - Anwar Ibrahim</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Royal Thai Army: Thai commanders argue that Cambodian forces fired first on Thai troops near the border, used rockets that threatened Thai civilian areas, and forced Thailand to escalate to airstrikes in order to neutralise nearby military positions and shield its population.
