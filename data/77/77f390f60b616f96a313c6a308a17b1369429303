<p>Taking on or switching to a new tool needs to be done mindfully or you risk the newcomer distracting or detracting from the job it is supposed to help with.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/086-questions-for-a-plain-text-advocate" title="wikilink">four tough questions</a> I asked myself 18 months ago while preparing to jump into Bullet Journalling can be applied to the potential adoption of any new tool.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Why this tool, and why now?</li>
<li>What is the time and attention cost of adopting it?</li>
<li>What is the likelihood of getting sucked into tweaking the tool rather than doing the work?</li>
<li>Will the tool get out of the way, or distract?</li>
</ol>
<p>As I’ve started using three new apps (<a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/157-2025-05-19-journelly-is-org-for-those-who-dont-do-org">Journelly</a>, <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/160-antinote-adds-calculations-to-obsidian">Antinote</a>, and <a href="https://www.beorgapp.com" target="_blank">Beorg</a>) and one new paper notebook method (<a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/126-dash-plus-system-in-obtf-and-analog-notes">Dash Plus</a>) recently, I ran each of them through these questions. Happily, I was pleased with the answers!</p>
<p>These tools add efficiency and fun to my workflow. They have a limited capacity for being tweaked, so I’m finding it easy to focus on the work, not the tool.</p>
<p>Next time you’re contemplating embracing a new tool, take 10 minutes to answer these questions honestly. You’re sure to learn something helpful.</p>
<p>Next, create a calendar event or reminder to repeat the exercise (in the past tense) once you’ve been using the tool for at least three months, and compare your answers.</p>
