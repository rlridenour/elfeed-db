Apple today released a new firmware update for the USB-C version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> headphones. The new firmware is version 7E108, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/airpods-max-7e101-firmware/">prior 7E101 firmware</a> the device was previously running.<br/>

There is no word on what's new in the firmware as of yet, if anything. It is likely that the update focuses on under-the-hood performance improvements.<br/>
<br/>
With the prior 7E101 firmware, Apple added support for lossless audio and ultra low-latency audio for the USB-C &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, so there could also be a bug fix related to this capability.<br/>
<br/>
The USB-C &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; now support 24-bit 48 kHz lossless audio, which is designed to allow listeners to experience music the way the artist created it in the studio.<br/>
<br/>
Firmware <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/airpods-firmware-update-instructions/">can be installed</a> by putting the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; in Bluetooth range of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi, and then plugging them in to charge. It can take up to 30 minutes for firmware to update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your firmware version by going to Settings &gt; Bluetooth and selecting the Info button next to the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; when they are connected to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, or Mac.<br/>
