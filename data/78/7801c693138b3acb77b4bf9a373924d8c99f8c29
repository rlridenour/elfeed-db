<p>Democrat Eileen Higgins won Miami’s runoff mayoral election on Tuesday, defeating Republican Emilio Gonzalez, who had been endorsed by President Trump, in a city long considered part of his Florida base. Her victory ends roughly three decades in which Republicans controlled the mayor’s office and makes her the first woman to lead Miami, as well as the first Democrat and first non-Cuban or non-Cuban-American to hold the post in about 30 years. Preliminary results show Higgins receiving about 59% of the vote to Gonzalez’s 41% in the Hispanic‑majority city after a campaign that highlighted concerns over affordability, immigration policies and local governance. National outlets note that the upset adds to a series of Democratic gains ahead of the 2026 midterm elections and signals shifting political priorities in parts of Florida.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PirmnGqctmmqI2uH8rcoEcmurrv-imIDmQ1Lu18SRjg9g32kOz5VSuBIPXG2-Nyed2N1LRsZ7epN1km3DMcyNDX8D0KpXvyoeVTa1hBGBy28j9ySNztlOVtMUTQE0wty9GA4rlB6Op0yTDgB0vbL0_lSFrKN5HEhH4k7McTdvbvJLe3_ycsuKn1BTuCppKZ1oKBVCcPKC7y8m85JoPwsoRrmkBM50QZTKwsW0yujjH3Ete8DUThs7bTXqrEuVV-JZoQMYK1L8LikOOXBBA' alt='Miami mayor-elect Eileen Higgins celebrates with supporters after winning the city’s mayoral runoff election on December 9, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Voter demographics: Miami’s electorate remains majority Hispanic, with the city historically dominated by Cuban American political leadership that has generally favored Republicans in recent decades.</li><li>Campaign themes: Higgins focused on housing affordability, worries over President Trump’s immigration enforcement, and promises of more transparent city governance, themes her campaign said resonated strongly in immigrant communities.</li><li>Republican response: Emilio Gonzalez, a former city manager and the Republican contender, publicly conceded the race and said he called Higgins to congratulate her after the results became clear.</li><li>Non-partisan ballot: Although Miami’s mayoral contest is officially non-partisan, both candidates campaigned with clear party identities, and Higgins openly embraced the Democratic label throughout the race.</li><li>National political ripples: Analysts point out that this flip in a high‑profile Sun Belt city offers Democrats a symbolic boost as they seek to improve performance in Florida and other competitive states before the 2026 midterms.</li></ul><blockquote>We’ve shown tonight that every neighborhood deserves to be heard and that this city can choose a future that works for everyone. - Eileen Higgins</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Eileen Higgins and campaign: Higgins framed her win as a mandate to tackle rising living costs and to make Miami’s city hall more responsive to residents who feel left out of past decision‑making..
