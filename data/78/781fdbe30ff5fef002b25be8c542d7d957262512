<p>The UK Labour government announced a wide-ranging overhaul of its asylum system on the weekend, saying it will strip back protections and end automatic state support for many people who claim asylum as part of moves to reduce irregular migration. Ministers said the package, inspired by Denmark&#x27;s tougher approach, aims to make the UK a less attractive route for irregular arrivals and to make removals easier, framing the changes as a response to persistent Channel crossings and rising political pressure over migration. Refugee and charity groups warned the plan risks harming vulnerable people and urged the government to stop scapegoating migrants, while commentators note the shift follows growing public concern about immigration.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/KYx_y8rUpO3S042qU5cIzvAUXSsIIbbFLp_rPnlUhUUdicU-74XgIKibsl6LTiD39MS_UPDWzEqQjXV9VUPK930wM0TeNxee3IT0mH0KgCOsfK-2nHgts7H4oqykFQVHPIoBBj71AR6eaZWaNa8lcBl71ufHuCbKA8OrWweqaYHou97C_yKdaMf6EVpZNkR8xzB-GymdLXPWnqIQnMj8v3rLIk2GEkn34EOuwFJC_ecbVZVquujRiXrDr2c' alt='The Labour government has been hardening its immigration policies, as it seeks to stem the surging popularity of the populist Reform UK party.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Duration of status: Officials will shorten the length of granted refugee status, reportedly reducing some protections to a 30-month status period under the new rules.</li><li>Route to settlement: The plan would extend the required wait before a recognized refugee can apply for long-term settlement to as long as 20 years, according to reporting on the package&#x27;s proposed residency changes.</li><li>Support made discretionary: The Home Office says it will remove the statutory duty to provide support in certain cases and make housing and weekly allowances discretionary for asylum seekers who can work but choose not to or who break the law.</li><li>Accommodation rights: Ministers plan to curtail asylum seekers&#x27; automatic entitlement to state-funded accommodation, changing how local housing support is allocated.</li><li>Asylum caseload: Recent government figures show asylum claims have risen sharply, with reporting citing about 109,343 people claiming asylum in the year ending March 2025, a marked increase on previous years.</li></ul><blockquote>This country has a proud tradition of welcoming those fleeing danger, but our generosity is drawing illegal migrants across the Channel - Shabana Mahmood</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood / UK government: The overhaul is intended to reduce irregular migration, make the UK less attractive to illegal routes and make removals easier, stressing a shift from automatic support to more conditional assistance.
