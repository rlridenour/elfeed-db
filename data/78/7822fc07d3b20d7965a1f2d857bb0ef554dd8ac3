<p>One significant element of the defunding of public media and the closing of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is the loss of funding for emergency communication. M. Maher doesn’t talk about it in the Colbert clip. We all should not lose site of it.</p>
<p>From the AP: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-fema-cpb-npr-public-radio-emergency-alerts-warning-systems-99a5a37b6a62e0e01b9ee99b39cfe457">Emergency alert systems grants on hold after Trump, Congress spending cuts | …</a></p>
<blockquote><p>(Congress in 2022) authorized $136 million over three years for the program (the Next Generation Warning System). But CPB, which manages the grant money, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/public-broadcasting-defunding-pbs-npr-94708ffb8313d4811fa6ca199fe454ad">is shutting down on Sept. 30</a> after Congress and President Donald Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pbs-npr-budget-cuts-trump-republicans-b0044285659ab708e23eb2dc2f3eabfa">defunded it in July</a>.</p>
<p>That could leave unspent millions in grant dollars that were awarded but not yet paid to stations, imperiling <a href="https://cpb.org/NGWS/impact" class="broken_link">dozens of projects</a> meant to save lives in emergencies. The need for robust and redundant warning systems was made tragically clear in July when Texas floods killed at least 136 people, many in areas with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-flood-rescue-kerr-county-camp-a043e4a5a1f5ddc807bc66f5858595da">spotty cellphone reception</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-floods-camp-warning-system-not-funded-0845df62390b9623331ba4a030c5fc7d">no siren systems</a>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The recently defunded nonprofit corporation that distributed federal money to public media stations across the United States is warning of another casualty when it shuts down next month: the resilience of the nation’s emergency alert systems.</p>

<p>The money would have covered adding generators, solar panels and batteries to stay on air during power outages, as well as a remote management system to repair sites from afar in the harsh winters, when several are reachable only by snowmobile.</p></blockquote>
