<p>Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune granted a pardon to French‑Algerian writer Boualem Sansal, allowing his immediate release and transfer to Germany for medical care after nearly a year in custody. German president Frank‑Walter Steinmeier personally requested the pardon and Germany acted as mediator to secure Sansal&#x27;s transfer, a move that negotiators say preserved Algerian presidential dignity while responding to international appeals. Sansal, 81 and reported to have prostate cancer, had been sentenced in March to five years for “undermining national unity” after his arrest during a visit to Algeria last year, a case that strained ties with France and drew public reactions from authors and officials. France expressed relief at the development, while many writers celebrated the release even as some voiced lingering anger at the arrest and conviction.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wI9BW_ygw7qKm4Hx6y0IapjIsF4f1VUAwI37Hym9xx1knySQB-4urwU1vYFOJ7lwzbem6O9W29GlvkdawwFgcHjvD01YUZX_ymZN_2HSTWn6H_DdWDOOqn4CSopyVdBysr48FEdCt4-Z1A_Dkz9qgZFnlZb4zqT09Vk3KQy30QAJfRHheD-mExEwFVTI5QKXv91zXnTa3fcSDIU5Y60' alt='Boualem Sansal’s case has inflamed tensions between Algeria and France, where he acquired citizenship.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>French tone change: France&#x27;s interior minister Laurent Nuñez advocated calm, uncompromising cooperation with Algiers, marking a shift from his predecessor&#x27;s approach during the crisis.</li><li>Writers&#x27; reactions: Numerous authors — including Leïla Slimani, Daniel Pennac, Kamel Daoud and Amélie Nothomb — publicly expressed joy at the pardon while also reporting lingering anger over Sansal&#x27;s detention.</li><li>Diplomatic optics: German mediation was framed as a face‑saving solution that allowed President Tebboune to grant a pardon without appearing to bow to French pressure.</li><li>Medical transfer: Officials said Sansal, who is 81 and has prostate cancer, will be transferred to Germany for medical treatment following the pardon.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Algerian presidency: The presidency said Tebboune granted a pardon following a request from Germany, enabling Sansal&#x27;s release and transfer abroad.
