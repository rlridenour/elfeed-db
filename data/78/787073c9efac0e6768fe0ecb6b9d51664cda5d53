<p>From Apple’s support documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can generate a report of requests your iPhone has sent to
Private Cloud Compute.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to Settings, then tap Privacy &amp; Security.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap Apple Intelligence Report, then choose a report duration
for the last 15 minutes (default) or last 7 days. Choose off to
disable the report.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: The report may be empty if there haven’t been any
  Private Cloud Compute requests since you changed the
  duration.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap Export Activity, choose a place to store the file, then tap
Export.</p>

<p>The report is saved as a file named
  Apple_Intelligence_Report.json.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the file with a text reader.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>These are the iOS instructions, but they’re exactly the same on MacOS 15 Sequoia. My first generated report was empty for the last 7 days, and it was empty again even after running the Writing Tools Proofread function on the text of my 4,000-word “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</a>” article from this week. But when I ran the Writing Tools Summarize feature on the same text, I wound up with a long entry that was sent to Private Cloud Compute. So, at the moment, Summarize seems like a good way to invoke Private Cloud Compute, even from a relatively powerful Mac.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/something-is-rotten-in-cupertino-apple-intelligence-summary.text">Here’s the summary Apple Intelligence generated</a>. I have to say: it’s pretty good. It’s completely petty but also completely <em>me</em> to notice and object to the way it uses two spaces after periods — and worse, only <em>some</em> of the time. Also, the sentence “This raises concerns about the company’s ability to maintain its position as a leader in AI innovation” is, let’s say, off the mark.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/10/29/check-writing-tools-using-air/">Howard Oakley wrote a post</a> with a brief overview of the structure and contents of these reports back on October 29.</p>
