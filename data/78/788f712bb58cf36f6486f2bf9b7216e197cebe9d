The Apple Watch Series 11 is anticipated to offer hypertension detection as the device's next major health monitoring advancement, potentially with AI-powered health-coaching features. It is also rumored to offer a new chip and, on cellular models, 5G RedCap connectivity. <br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is expected to receive these new capabilities, as well as features that came to last year's Series 10 model such as a brighter display with a faster refresh rate and a redesigned metal back to facilitate faster charging. However, iPhone-like satellite connectivity features are rumored to be the biggest upgrade for this year's new Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
The third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> is rumored to feature a "new look," perhaps with an all-new plastic casing to bring down the device's cost. It is also likely to feature different size options, either by reducing the bezels around the display or enlarging the screens similar to the Apple Watch Series 7. It should also feature a new chip and a lower price point.<br/>
<br/>
We also look at the latest rumors about iPadOS 19, where a macOS-style menu bar is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ipados-19-mac-like-menu-bar-rumor/">expected to appear on-screen</a> when the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> is connected to a Magic Keyboard. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> could also be getting a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ios-19-iphone-stage-manager-rumor/">Stage Manager-like feature</a> when connected to an external display. <br/>
