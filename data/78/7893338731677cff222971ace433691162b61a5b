</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
In which the Knights learn of a blood feud and yet another Myth plaguing the realm.
</p>
        <p>Three horses, two with riders and the smaller other riderless.  Both riders
armed and armored.  A bow shot away, they see the eastern gatehouse of Castle
Steimfluss, its squat towers gleaming proud, gates open with portcullis raised,
as though a mouth feed a feast of peddlers and vagabonds.  The gate house
protects the bridge that cross over the river to the fortress that rises from
the island in the middle of the river.</p>
<p>Beatrice thinks upon the trial of the morning.  Her sense of purpose restored
after Weydlyn’s victory over the Sergeants of the Judge.  Then her surprise at
finding her possessions restored and waiting outside the checkered courtyard.
Her mace, radiant armor, polished mirror, and her horse.</p>
<p>She grins thinking of Light’s Return, once name unknown, yet no longer; now
tethered to her blue roan horse.  She leans forward, scratching her horse’s neck
and whispers to the horse, “Worry not, as forewarned, I shall not name you.
Though I wonder, my friend, what power lurks within your name.”</p>
<p>Before being within bow shot, they both dismount and lead their horses forward,
while battered and bruised and carrying news, they are not harbingers riding in
on the wings of haste.</p>
<p>A guard in front of the gates takes note of the two heavily armed knights
approaching, quickly raises then lowers his head just a bit then waits for the
knights to draw within a suitable speaking distance.</p>
<p>Beatrice looks to Weydlynd, and says, “Introduce yourself first, keep it short,
and I’ll do the remainder of the talking.  Lord Prentise will remember me and
should help us gain a more immediate audience with him.”</p>
<p>Weydlyn grunts as the guard draws close enough to speak without shouting, “In
the name of Lord Prentise, please state your business.”</p>
<p>“I am Sir Weydlynd, the Reforger of Knighthood,” he says as he catches the gaze
of the guard then points his head toward Sir Beatrice.</p>
<p>“And I am Sir Beatrice, I have once before helped Lord Prentise; though I hope I
may do more.  And we wish to speak to Lord Prentise on matters regarding the
Realm.  Of the devil’s court of Amrageft.”</p>
<p>The guard tilts his head, as though puzzling something out, almost speaks,
pauses, then says, “As you insist Sir Beatrice and Sir Weydlynd, I shall ensure
that you are announced.  May you find the Lord’s hospitality most welcoming.”</p>
<h2 id="checking-game-state">Checking Game State</h2>
<p>I have deferred on building out relationships between the different holdings.
But now that they’ve arrived, I need to do some work.</p>
<p>I also review the rule book to see what the Sir Prentise might know of the
Judge.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

<strong>Vassals</strong> know about the nearest Myth, and its general direction.  If it is
adjacent to their home, then they know its precise location.  They know
Landmarks in their home and neighbouring Hexes.

<footer>&mdash;<cite>Mythic Bastionland</cite>
page 19

</blockquote>

<p>Using my mythic-bastionland.el package and “hidden” map, I invoke <code>M-x mythic-bastionland-nearest-myth</code>, punch in <code>5,3</code> (the coordinates of Castle
Steimfluss) and get back “The Judge”.  I then invoke <code>M-x mythic-bastionland-direction</code> to find that “The Judge” is to the Northeast of the
Castle.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I when checking direction I chose the wrong one.  And gained very
useful information about the actual hex: “The Judge” was north of <code>7,3</code>.  Which
the player should not know.  So I’m going to rebuild the map based on what must
be true.</p>
<p>Also, I’m going to need a command to reveal the direction of adjacent landmarks
to a holding (maybe a Hex, but we’ll work first from a Holding).  Which after a
bit of work, I’ve included.</p>
<h2 id="just-in-time-locations-and-relationships">Just in Time Locations and Relationships</h2>
<p>Moving into a Holding, I wanted to attend to the relationship of holdings and
their rulers.  I read through <a href="https://www.bastionland.com/2023/11/sparking-conflict.html">BASTIONLAND: Sparking Conflict</a> and rolled up the
relationships and conflicts.</p>

<h2 id="conflict-escalation-procedure">Conflict Escalation Procedure</h2>
<p>Reading <a href="https://www.bastionland.com/2025/09/holding-threads.html">Holding Threads</a> I’m thinking about how to consider the relationship
between leaders, conflicts between locations, and the present woes or dramas
unfolding at a location.</p>
<p>I’m thinking that the relationships color the conflict; but are not things that
necessarily resolve.  Maybe an End of Year procedure to see how these
relations change?</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.bastionland.com/2025/09/holding-threads.html">Holding Threads</a>, Chris checks each morning phase while in the city.  I feel
that is too frequent.  I’m going to go with three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you start a session in a Holding make a Conflict Escalation Roll.</li>
<li>When you first enter a Holding make a Conflict Escalation roll.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also must consider if these pre-rolled things “exist” regardless of revelation
or only exist at the time of encountering them.  I’m going to assume they don’t
exist.</p>
<p>I’m contemplating having the Drama and Woe of the current holding enter into the
fray of Escalation.  For now, that’s what I’ll try.</p>

Let’s check the Conflict Escalation: I get a 3.  And Escalate the
Conflict—Bloodfeud Truce—between Steimfluss and Vukturm.
</small></p>
<p><small>
I quickly write up the following:
</small></p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><small>Kinsfolk of both feuding sides meet, any weapons ceremonially tied.</small></li>
<li><small>Cursing of one or the other families can be heard throughout the streets and

<li><small>Kinsfolk recently arrived to plead case, are chased out of town.  Only a few
rotten vegetables are thrown.</small></li>
<li><small>Catchy songs and poems mocking and deriding the others are heard whistled,
hummed and whispered.</small></li>
<li><small>Allies are sought as reprisals are planned.</small></li>
<li><small>Now is the time of reprisals.</small></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="of-sir-weydlyns-days">Of Sir Weydlyn’s Days</h2>
<p>During the first day Sir Weydlyn notices several <em>fancy</em> dressed people, wearing
similar attire to those that were harassing Tompot.  He asks a few folks and
they say that they are pledged to Yelena, 2nd cousin of Lord Prentise.</p>
<p>Weydlyn learns of the bad blood between these two.  And while a tentative peace
holds, Weydlyn scratches the scar on his jaw and thinks how he would be quick to
spill that <em>fancy</em> blood.</p>
<p>After a few days of rest, recovery, and hospitality, Sir Weydlyn’s wounds are
nicely healed and he feels ready to present his case to Lord Prentise regarding
Tompot.  But he first stops to see how he might secure a helm for himself.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>
For Sir Weydlyn, I wonder what does the armor smith desire of Sir Weydlyn.  I
roll on the Sparks and get Knowledge and Curiosity.  I think the smith wishes to
know about Weydlyn’s bolt-guisarme and how to make it and would exchange
knowledge for a fine coif.  Weydlyn agrees to share, again a Clarity test with a
consequence of failure being that this will take considerable time.
</small></p>
<p><small>
And Weydlyn fails, he’s not very good at explaining.  I tag the Woe of the
Castle.  Greed and Oath are in play.
</small></p>

</section>

<p>A few days into Weydlyn’s work in the forge, agitation throbbing, the din of the
forge piercing and pounding his aching skull, he hits his limit.  A page’s
arrival brought his rage to a boil.  Lord Prentise was now demanding his
presence, and the idiot armoursmith was still no closer to working out the
nuances of the bolt-guisarme.</p>
<p>Fed up, he looks at the blistered man, and barks, “I have tried these last few
days to teach you, but you are an anvil, nothing getting through that thick
skull of yours.”</p>
<p>Weydlyn continues with a litany of curses and excoriations that he often heard
directed at him during his apprenticeship.</p>
<p>The armour smith’s face grows even redder, but knows better than to challenge a
knight of the realm.</p>
<p>“I’ll be taking that coif as I have spent more time in this forge than I’d ever
need to work one of those from steel.”</p>
<p>The smith scowls, biting his tongue, tasting the copper of drawn blood.  “Ay
sir.”</p>
<h2 id="of-sir-beatrices-days">Of Sir Beatrice’s Days</h2>
<p>Sir Beatrice, in the meantime, spends her time amongst the squires, looking to
whom she might recruit.  Neither Weydlyn nor Beatrice are certain if their paths
will continue after they present to themselves to Lord Prentise.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>I call for a Clarity test for Sir Beatrice.  She succeeds and makes note of the
quality of squires and prepares her request of Lord Prentise.</small></p>
</section>

<p>While watching and offering guidance to the exuberant and receptive youth, she
finds herself thinking of whether she wishes to cast her lot with Sir Weydlyn.
She saw him rise to greatness, and fight to the brink in order to restore her
knighthood.</p>
<p>She knew his deed was one motivated by fear of his mortality and losing his one
identity, knowing that without the mantle of Knighthood, he’d return to the
forge (and source of scars both seen and unseen) or he’d fall into brigandry.</p>
<p>Weydlyn took his Oaths seriously, but behind it was fear.  Something most
dangerous.  She wondered how long she could withstand the blasts of hot anger
pouring from mouth and eyes.  Could she bring calming light to him?</p>
<p>A few days after their arrival, Sir Beatrice requested an audience with Lord
Prentise; she did not include Sir Weydlyn.  She spent the evening before
polishing mirror and armor.  Though she would leave armor and weapon behind, she
knew that her mirror was always welcome.</p>
<h2 id="an-audience-with-lord-prentise">An Audience with Lord Prentise</h2>
<p>“Presenting Sir Beatrice, the Violet Knight, Retriever of the Vassal Rod,”
proclaims a herald as the doors open to the throne room.  Upon a dias sits Lord
Prentise, lounging in his blackened leather armor.  His mouth holding that
puckered look, as though sniffing something.</p>
<p>Sir Beatrice takes not of the numerous rat holes throughout this room, she
shudders just a bit, seeing a tail dart into the darkness.</p>
<p>“Good Sir Beatrice, since last we spoke, I had received a decree from a most
unwelcome courier, that you had been stripped of your knighthood.  Yet, when I
heard your arrival and had my steward read that letter again, it was nothing
more than a naughty limerick not worth repeating,” said the man smiling, at
first looking Beatrice up and down, then looking away in some perhaps private
shame.</p>
<p>“I have Sir Weydlyn to thank for my restoration.  I wish, that we might exchange
news so that we might both make better of our Knightly Oaths.”</p>
<p>Beatrice shares the events of the Judge.  Lord Prentise shares of the cursed
Silence to the south and the Minstrel’s Nook dwelling to the north.  Lord
Prentise shares that the Lich is closer and to the West.</p>
<p class="verse">
From fable’s heart springs fable’s fear, a past within a past<br />
From time before our nightmares still, made flesh by sullen mass.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This session was me working through Holding’s procedures and random tables as
well as implementing functions for my mapping.  I spent a bit of the morning
working on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~jeremyf/mythic-bastionland.el">my Mythic Bastionland Emacs package</a>.  To answer questions around neighboring landmarks.  Also to output the map.</p>
<p>My goal is to express game state in the data structure I use to generate a map.
That way, as new information arises, I can use that to track the information and
even regenerate the map if I so choose.</p>
<p>Regarding the fiction, I felt that this was a session in which I (as the
referee) needed to shift from the Wilderness mindset to a Holdings mindset.
Which meant reconciling various posts I’ve read and creating corresponding
procedures.</p>
<p>As a player, I’m uncertain if I want to continue with both of the knights.  I
thought I’d explore writing from Sir Beatrice’s perspective to see how that
feels.</p>
<p>I also chose to step out of the narrative and exchange information.  I’ll review
the Lich and bring that into the narrative in future sessions.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>
