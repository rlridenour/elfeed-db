<p id="p1">On Wednesday evening, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rodgers <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-breach-of-trust-apple-held-in-contempt-over-app-store-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer">held Apple in contempt</a>, ordering, among other things, that it immediately drop the 27% fee it was charging developers who linked users to the web for purchases. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25924283-epic-v-apple-contempt-order/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As the judge put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays.
</p></blockquote>

<p id="p4"><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/01/apple-app-store-guidelines-external-links/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As Chance Miller reported at 9to5Mac</a>, those changes are already reflected in Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Review Guidelines</a>. In an email sent to anyone with a developer account, Apple explained:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  The App&nbsp;Review Guidelines have been updated for compliance with a United&nbsp;States court decision regarding buttons, external links, and other calls to action in apps. These changes affect apps distributed on the United&nbsp;States storefront of the App&nbsp;Store, and are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>3.1.1: Apps on the United&nbsp;States storefront are not prohibited from including buttons, external links, or other calls to action when allowing users to browse NFT collections owned by others.</li>
<li>3.1.1(a): On the United&nbsp;States storefront, there is no prohibition on an app including buttons, external links, or other calls to action, and no entitlement is required to do so.</li>
<li>3.1.3: The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United&nbsp;States storefront.</li>
<li>3.1.3(a): The External Link Account entitlement is not required for apps on the United States storefront to include buttons, external links, or other calls to action.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p id="p6">(Source: Apple email to developers on May 1, 2025).</p>
<p id="p7">Notably, the changes affect only the U.S. App Store, further fragmenting App Store rules along geopolitical boundaries which began with regulations in China, South Korea, Japan, the Netherlands, and the EU.</p>
<p id="p8">Probably the best evidence that Apple&rsquo;s former rules were restraining competition is the flurry of additional news since Judge Gonzalez Rodgers&rsquo; ruling:</p>
<ul id="ul9"><li><a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-breach-of-trust-apple-held-in-contempt-over-app-store-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As I predicted</a> in my story, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659754/patreon-update-iphone-ios-app-apple-payment-system-ruling" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon has said</a> it will submit an update to its app to allow creators to accept payments outside its iOS app, something that was possible until last summer when <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/patreon-lays-out-how-it-will-deal-with-apples-insistence-that-it-use-app-store-in-app-purchases/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon was forced to retrofit its app</a> to account for Apple&rsquo;s In-App Purchases and payments through its website in what was an inelegant solution that forced creators to either charge more on iOS or absorb Apple&rsquo;s fees on what are often small monthly payments to begin with.</li>
<li><a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-01/following-landmark-court-ruling-spotify-submits-new-app-update-to-apple-to-benefit-u-s-consumers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify posted on its blog</a> that it has already submitted an update to its app that will let users see how much a Spotify subscription costs from inside the app and link out to Spotify&rsquo;s website to upgrade or change their subscription plans.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/digital-goods" rel="noopener noreferrer">Payment processor Stripe whipped up documentation</a> guiding developers through the process of setting up subscription and digital goods sales outside their apps.</li>
<li>Beginning in June, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Epic Games Store will handle payment processing for developers at no cost</a> up to the developers&rsquo; first $1 million of revenue. After $1 million of revenue the split will be the existing 88% to developers and 12% to Epic Games. In June, Epic Games will also offer developers the ability to set up their own webshops for &lsquo;out-of-app purchases.&rsquo; The webshops will be available to iOS developers in the U.S. and EU and users making purchases in them will get 5% back in Epic Rewards for their purchases. Epic Games has not said how much it will charge developers who set up a webshop.</li>
</ul><p id="p10">These moves by big players aren&rsquo;t surprising, and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see more companies explore ways to take advantage of Wednesday&rsquo;s ruling. Over time, though, the more interesting consequence of Wednesday&rsquo;s ruling will be whether and how it changes the business models of indie developers and other small businesses that offer apps.</p>
