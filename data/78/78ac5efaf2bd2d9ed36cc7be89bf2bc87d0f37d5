<li>Mercifully easy to use in the heat of the moment. Which is, you know…the point.</li>
<li>Works on both standard fires and the premium ones that get worse with water.</li>
<li>Think grease fires, electrical fires, gasoline fires, shit-it-looks-like-tonight-is-takeout-after-all fires.</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita? It can certainly neutralize one.</li>
</ul><h1>An ounce of prevention…</h1><p>“Stop, drop, and roll!”</p>
<p>We all learned it as kids. Honestly, for a lot of us, it’s right up there with <em>A2 + B2 = C2</em> and <em>the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell</em> as far as things we actually remember from grade school go.</p>
<p>And sure, there’s plenty of value in teaching us how to extinguish ourselves if engulfed in flames, but it also kind of begs the question of why early childhood education would focus so much on what we should do when we’re on fire and yet so little on how to avoid being in that predicament in the first place.</p>
<p>It’s way too easy to make it all the way to adulthood without knowing about things like not pouring water on a grease fire or that baking flour is surprisingly flammable and shouldn’t be dumped on a blazing pan in an emergency.</p>
<p>We’re not saying that school should have <em>no</em> stop, drop, and roll in the curriculum. Just that maybe they should spend a lesson or two on calmly putting a lid on your accidental crêpes flambé (or how to put the little accent hat on the e on a Mac. Good grief, Apple).</p>
<p>So in addition to learning about how to avoid household kitchen fires and knowing that a high school backpack filled with mostly depleted guava mama purple juice flavored vape cartridges can be surprisingly explosive in certain conditions, we could also show kids to keep cool and avoid a raging inferno using products available from <a href="http://meh.com">meh.com</a>, and we don’t mean novelty wireless speakers and semi-expired ramen packets.</p>
<p>No, today we have some proper hero stuff. This fire-stopping spray won’t turn a grease fire in a pan into a grease fire on the neighbor’s roof the way blasting it with your kitchen sink spray nozzle might, plus it’s about as easy to use as anything, even if you’re understandably feeling a bit panicked in the moment.</p>
<p>Basically, we want things to be easy for you later when the going gets tough, so what you need to do is order this two-pack now, when nothing around you is actively on fire, presumably.</p>
<p>Besides, wouldn’t you rather be coming to the forums here and telling us about how you saved the day thanks to Meh versus writing an email to your middle school praising that third-grade teacher who explained how to roll around on the floor because you overcooked the fajitas?</p>
<p>No-brainer.</p>
