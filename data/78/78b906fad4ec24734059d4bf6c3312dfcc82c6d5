<p>Chance Miller at 9to5Mac <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/28/where-are-apple-wallet-digital-ids-accepted/">did an excellent summary</a> of where, in theory, you can use digital IDs and where you cannot. The problem, <em>as always,</em> is the humans.</p>



<p>Even though TSA checkpoints are absolutely supposed to accept Digital IDs, on a recent trip, my particular TSA agent wasn’t having it. His words were something to the point of, “That’s not going to cut it. I need to see a <em>real identification</em>.” I guess I could have argued with him, but I’m not sure arguing with TSA agents is a good idea.</p>



<p>Because I was worried about this, I had my actual driver’s license with me, but if I hadn’t, I’m not so sure I would have gotten on a plane that day.</p>
