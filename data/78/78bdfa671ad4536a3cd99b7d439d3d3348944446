<p>Australia will soon enforce a new law preventing children under 16 from holding or creating accounts on major social media platforms, with the rules taking effect on December 10 and backed by substantial financial penalties for companies that fail to take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to comply. TikTok has announced it will block Australian users below that age threshold on the day the measure begins, acknowledging in messages to users that the change &quot;may be upsetting&quot; for some younger people who rely on the app. Meta has already started removing Australian under‑16s from Instagram, Threads and Facebook ahead of the deadline, as the government promotes its approach as a world‑first model for protecting children online. Supporters frame the law as a way to reduce digital harms for teenagers, while experts quoted in international coverage warn that enforcing strict age checks at scale could prove technically and legally challenging.</p><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Penalty framework: Platforms that fail to meet the law’s requirement to take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; face potential fines of A$49.5 million, adding strong financial pressure on global tech firms to adapt their systems in Australia.</li><li>Scope of platforms: The legislation applies broadly to popular services such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Threads, meaning most mainstream social networks used by Australian teens will need age‑based access controls.</li><li>Government expectations: Australian officials have presented the measure as a template they expect other countries to copy, arguing that national governments can and should set age rules for social media access.</li><li>Teen creators’ concerns: Young Australian influencers interviewed say they worry about losing their audiences, income, and creative outlets when their accounts are removed despite having built large followings through short‑form video content.</li><li>Global policy debate: Commentators in international media note that governments worldwide are watching how Australia’s ban unfolds, particularly around its real‑world effects on teen well‑being, privacy, and the feasibility of large‑scale age verification.</li></ul><blockquote>These changes may be upsetting for some people in our community, but we must comply with local laws, even when we don’t agree with them. - TikTok spokesperson</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Australian government: Officials promote the under‑16 ban as a world‑leading framework that other countries are likely to adopt in order to better safeguard children from online harms.
