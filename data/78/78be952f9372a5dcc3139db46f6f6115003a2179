With the fourth betas of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a>, macOS 26, visionOS 26, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a>, Apple has re-enabled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> Notification Summaries for apps in the News and Entertainment categories. <br/>

After installing the betas, there is a pop up for enabling notification summaries across these and other categories. Users can opt-in or opt-out of notification summaries on a per-category basis. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says that it has improved notification summaries in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, addressing issues that could cause confusion with news headlines. <br/>
<br/>
All notification summaries for News and Entertainment apps that are generated with &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; will be italicized and will be annotated with a "Summarized by &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;" notice. <br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to further test and refine &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; summaries for news articles during the rest of the &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; beta testing process, and there is an option for users to report a concern directly if there is an issue with a notification summary.<br/>
<br/>
Notification Summaries for the News and Entertainment category <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/ios-18-3-news-notifications-removed/">were removed in the iOS 18.3 update</a> in January, following criticism over some misleading news headlines created by &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; Notification Summaries are available on devices that support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;. The feature groups multiple notifications from the same app together, providing a one-sentence overview of the content. The short summaries were causing issues when AI pulled the wrong details from news stories, but Apple's improvements should help fix the issue. <br/>
