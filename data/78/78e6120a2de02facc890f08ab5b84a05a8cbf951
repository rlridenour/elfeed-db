Based on a single unconfirmed result uploaded to the Geekbench 6 database today, the M5 chip has pulled off an impressive feat. Specifically, the chip achieved a score of 4,263 for single-core CPU performance, which is the <strong>highest single-core score</strong> that has ever been recorded in the Geekbench 6 database for any Mac or PC processor.<br/>
<br/>
In the 14-inch MacBook Pro, the M5 chip has a 10-core CPU, with four performance cores and six efficiency cores. The single-core score on Geekbench 6 refers to the performance achieved by just one of the performance cores, whereas the multi-core score refers to the maximum performance achieved by all 10 of the CPU cores combined.<br/>
<br/>
A chip's multi-core score reflects the maximum CPU performance for multi-threaded tasks, but single-core performance remains important for certain games and apps, and it plays a key role in overall system responsiveness and snappiness.<br/>
<br/>
The top five single-core scores for Mac and PC processors in the Geekbench 6 database:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>M5 (14-inch MacBook Pro):</strong> 4,263</li><br/>
<li><strong>M4 Max (16-inch MacBook Pro):</strong> 3,914</li><br/>
<li><strong>M4 Pro (16-inch MacBook Pro):</strong> 3,871</li><br/>
<li><strong>M4 (Mac mini):</strong> 3,784</li><br/>
<li><strong>AMD Ryzen 9950X3D:</strong> 3,399</li></ul>Unsurprisingly, the M5 chip in the new iPad Pro achieved a <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/14174832">similar single-core score of 4,175</a>, based on Geekbench 6 results available so far.<br/>

As for multi-core performance, the M5 chip in the 14-inch MacBook Pro achieved a score of 17,862 in the single result, which makes it up to 20% faster than the M4 chip in the previous-generation 14-inch MacBook Pro. The standard M5 chip is <strong>faster than the M3 Pro chip</strong>, and <strong>nearly on par with the M1 Ultra chip</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
A selection of multi-core scores for Mac chips:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>M4 Max (16-inch MacBook Pro):</strong> 25,645</li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 Ultra (Mac Studio):</strong> 18,405</li><br/>
<li><strong>M5 (14-inch MacBook Pro):</strong> 17,862</li><br/>
<li><strong>M3 Pro (14-inch MacBook Pro):</strong> 15,257</li><br/>
<li><strong>M4 (14-inch MacBook Pro):</strong> 14,726</li></ul>The new 14-inch MacBook Pro is available to pre-order now, and it launches on Wednesday.<br/>
