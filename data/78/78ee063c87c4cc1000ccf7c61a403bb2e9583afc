  <p>I’m not even talking about Apple and AI here. We’ve done that, <a href="https://spyglass.org/apple-ai-siri/">a
lot</a>. Probably enough — for now (famous last words). I’m
talking about Apple in general. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/2f3K43FHRKo?si=7lIWEBMSvCk-rxwG&amp;ref=spyglass.org">Watching this OpenAI video</a> — again, not an event, just a product walk-through with various
team members (though this one happened to be “MC’d” by Sam Altman) — I had this old, familiar feeling as they walked through the new
features: joy.</p>

<p>As ridiculous as it may sound, I was almost giddy around what I
was seeing. It’s a feeling that I recall well from many an Apple
event back in the day.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is <em>exactly</em> what I wanted! They did it!” That kind
of thing.</p>

<p>This will sound unfair or harsh to Apple, but I really don’t think
that it is. I can really only speak for myself here, and perhaps
I’m alone — but I suspect that I’m not — it has been a while
since I’ve gotten that feeling from an Apple announcement. That
loving feeling.</p>

<p>I gave the updated ChatGPT the instruction “Create an image of the main characters from ‘Severance’ as Lego figures” and this is the first response it gave me:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-chatgpt-4o.png" class="noborder">
  <img
    width = 425
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-chatgpt-4o.png"
    alt = "Four Lego figures who look like Mark, Helly, Dylan (maybe?) and Irving (even less maybe)."
  /></a></p>

<p>I gave Apple’s Image Playground, running on MacOS 15.3.2 Sequoia, the equivalent prompt — “The main characters from ‘Severance’ as Lego figures” — and it gave me this as its first response:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-image-playground.png" class="noborder">
  <img
    width = 425
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-image-playground.png"
    alt = "Three Lego figures, two yellow, one red, which bear zero resemblance to anyone or anything from “Severance” whatsoever."
  /></a></p>

<p>One of the above images qualifies as “<em>Hey, that could be better but it’s pretty good for the first crack from a simple prompt</em>”, and the other qualifies as “<em>This bears zero resemblance to anyone or anything from</em> Severance”.</p>

<p>Guess which one of the two Apple is <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2025/1/7.html">actively promoting</a> to users as something they should try?</p>
