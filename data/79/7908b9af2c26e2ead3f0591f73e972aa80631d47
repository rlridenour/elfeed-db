Dolby Vision 2 features a more powerful image engine that Dolby says "unlocks even more out of your TV," plus it supports new Content Intelligence tools to optimize TV sets for a "captivating picture" based on the content that's being watched. Specifically, Dolby says that Content Intelligence will gain the following benefits:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Precision Black reduces consumer frustration that the image is "too dark" by making it crystal clear and improving clarity in any viewing environment without compromising artistic intent.</li><br/>
 	<li>Light Sense fine-tunes picture quality through advanced ambient light detection and new reference lighting data from the content source to optimize your TV for the ideal viewing experience.</li><br/>
 	<li>Sports and Gaming Optimization introduce new enhancements such as white point adjustments and motion control designed specifically to address the unique needs of live sports and gaming.</li><br/>
 	<li>New tone-mapping that takes advantage of modern TV improvements like brightness and color improvements.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
TVs will be able to provide higher brightness, sharper contrast, and more deeply saturated colors "while preserving the artist's creative vision," according to Dolby.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to these HDR features, Dolby Vision 2 includes Authentic Motion, described as a creative driven motion control tool that can make "scenes feel more authentically cinematic without unwanted judder."<br/>
<br/>
There's a core Dolby Vision 2 product that will provide improved picture quality to mainstream TVs, and a Dolby Vision 2 Max designed for the highest performing TVs. The Max product will utilize the full capabilities of higher-end displays.<br/>

Dolby Vision 2 will come first to TV sets from Hisense, but other manufacturers are likely to add support in the future. The current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> models support Dolby Vision, so it makes sense that a future version of the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; would include Dolby Vision 2.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dolby-vision/">Dolby Vision</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/02/dolby-vision-2/">Dolby Vision 2 Debuts With Solution for HDR Content That&#039;s &#039;Too Dark&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dolby-vision-2-debuts-with-solution-for-hdr-content-thats-too-dark.2464497/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
