<p>The sciences will see a 75% reduction in new PhD slots, and departments in the arts and humanities will see a reduction of 60%, reports <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/10/21/fas-phd-admissions-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Harvard Crimson</em></a>.</p>
<p>A source has confirmed that the <a href="https://philosophy.fas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Philosophy</a> is affected by the cuts. It will have to reduce the number of incoming PhD students for 2026 and 2027 from its <a href="https://philosophy.fas.harvard.edu/admissions-graduate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">typical 5 to 6 per year</a> to a total of 4 over the next two years. According to the <em>Crimson</em>, departments get to decide how to distribute the cuts over those two years. It has not yet been shared how Philosophy will be doing so.</p>
<p>The Dean of Harvard&#8217;s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Hopi E. Hoekstra, is reported by <em>The Crimson </em>as having &#8220;noted that many peer institutions paused PhD admissions altogether.&#8221; Yet very few programs so far have been mentioned in response to last month&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/09/15/philosophy-grad-programs-are-accepting-fewer-or-no-applications-for-next-year/">Which Philosophy Grad Programs Are Accepting Fewer or No Applications for Next Year?</a>&#8220;. What does Hoekstra know that we don&#8217;t? Feel free to add relevant information that earlier post.</p>
<p>Some online commentary about this news has suggested that Harvard is a bellweather for cuts at other institutions. Whether that&#8217;s the case is unclear, given that the university was one of several specifically targeted by the Trump administration with cuts to its federal funding, which contributed to an <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/10/17/harvard-financial-report-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operating loss of $113 million</a> in fiscal year 2025.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/10/22/harvard-cuts-phd-admissions/">Harvard Cuts PhD Admissions</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
