</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Of books read, wise ones littering my history, and relationships dissolved across an event horizon.

But sorrow will not silence<br />
Old dreams or young wisdom.<br />
Nor will it make me give up on<br />
The beautiful pure joy of life.<br />

<p>On <time datetime="2025-07-01" title="2025-07-01">Friday</time> I picked up <cite data-id="db53fb82-3dc9-47ca-8378-9cb234bffe6d">Wake Up</cite> by Jack Kerouac from
Olympia Books in Dowagiac.  Since reading <cite data-id="472C1DBD-E0EB-4510-96D4-E474DF0C313E">Siddhartha</cite> by Herman Hesse in high
school, I’ve felt a connection with Buddhism; affirmed again by <cite data-id="fee4ffa7-1d45-46e7-86f1-af203b92f54b">Aflame</cite> by Pico Iyer.</p>
<p>I grew up a pastor’s kid, attending General Conference Mennonite churches up to
and past the merger with the larger Mennonite Conference.  I attended a
Mennonite High School and College.  My first job was at Mennonite Mutual Aid.
So through all of that I internalized the thread of “Jesus as wise man” and saw,
in an important moment of life, the presence of other wise traditions; picking
up bits of Taoism and Buddhism and Stoicism in my formal education.</p>
<p>The introduction of <cite data-id="db53fb82-3dc9-47ca-8378-9cb234bffe6d">Wake Up</cite> explains, briefly Mahayana Buddhism has a greater
focus on love and Zen, which emerged from feudal Samurai Japan, with its
badass-ness.  I’ve appreciated the Koan’s of Zen, they disrupt my thinking.
Contrast where Mahayana, and <cite data-id="472C1DBD-E0EB-4510-96D4-E474DF0C313E">Siddhartha</cite> by Herman Hesse are of love.  And
<cite data-id="db53fb82-3dc9-47ca-8378-9cb234bffe6d">Wake Up</cite> follows more in the Mahayana tradition.</p>
<p>Further, the introduction highlights that the early Christian church’s doctrine
mixed with Mahayana influences; later castigated and proscribed by Constantine
and excoriated by Saint Augustine.  I’ve never explored those early years,
though know that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a> shaped the politic and domain of
the church.  Narrowing the possible and the allowed, thus positioning it to not
delve further, but to say that this is all there is.  To enclose.</p>
<p>Since getting the <cite data-id="db53fb82-3dc9-47ca-8378-9cb234bffe6d">Wake Up</cite>, I’ve read a few pages before drifting to sleep—no
more than six pages before my eyelids grow heavy and I find myself stumbling.
I’m reading tired and like to think that I’m opening my heart and mind, by way
of dream, to wrestle with aphorisms.  To turn a phrase from <cite data-id="AB3BE8D6-8D85-460F-8D91-A6B3128713C0">Dune</cite>, the sleeper
must awaken.</p>
<p>I’m also reading through <cite data-id="b1aaa6b7-baee-4d8f-8a63-94bb8f812777">Open Socrates</cite>, feeling that I need to bolster my
philosophical tendencies; in particular around the big three: Politics, Love,
and Death.  This has me reflecting on how I used my past polemics to cut
associations.  Instead of broadcasting about unfriending me on Facebook, I
should have simply deleted my Facebook.</p>
<p>I had thought that I still wanted those attachments, curated and manipulated by
a malignant algorithm.  Yet, upon release, I’ve found a greater calm.  However,
I broadcast my “piety” and made requests.  In hubris and arrogance.  And I think
a lot on a few severed friendship.  Those private thoughts that linger, and
resurface as I wrestle with an ill-sitting decision.</p>
<p>There’s a sorrow in abandoning the relationships to childhood friends.  Yet what
are the forces that nurture and strengthen those bonds in the era of moving for
one’s job?  Of each having children (or not) at different decades in life?  Of
chasing the illusion of upward mobility by moving along the horizontal, ever
away from a home base, created by growing up together.  Of living in the highly
politicized, in which algorithms seek to tear apart truth and connection.</p>
<p>Gravity is not a strong force.  Yet how can we fall towards each other as our
lives move in their own strange orbits around a singularity?</p>
