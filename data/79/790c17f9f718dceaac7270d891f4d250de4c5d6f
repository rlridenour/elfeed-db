According to a source familiar with the company's plans, Apple is highly likely to replace the current &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K with a new model later this year. The current model will be discontinued. <br/>
<br/>
Today's &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K came out in 2022, featuring the A15 Bionic chip, support for HDR10+, and a tweaked <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Remote with a USB-C port for charging. Apple does not refresh the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;'s hardware frequently, releasing a new model around every three years. This 2022 model is the newest and only &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; in the company's product lineup.<br/>
<br/>
The new model is expected to feature a newer chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/iphone-17-new-apple-tv-common-feature/">support for Wi-Fi 7</a>, and an Apple-designed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip for the first time, allowing Apple's smart home devices to work better together and synchronize data faster. The next-generation &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; could also be less expensive, with Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">aiming to lower prices</a> to make the device more competitive, according to Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is widely expected to debut a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/">new version of the Apple TV</a> in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/">late 2025</a>, between September and December. The latest information suggests that this is still the case, with internal moves related to the device's release continuing. <br/>
