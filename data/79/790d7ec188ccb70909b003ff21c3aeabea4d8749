</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Awaking to a lazy Sunday morning.
</p>
        <p>Overnight we received our first snowfall of the seasons, as two inches of heavy
wet snow arrived.  Trees still shedding their autumnal robes, bow heavier under
their white overcoats.</p>
<p>The two majestic white oaks with whom we share a bit of land carry a heavier
burden, as they, like many other oaks, cling in modesty to their falling
clothes, as though knowing that winter is no time for nakedness.</p>
<p>The south-eastern windows view a lake ringed in trees and humble houses; not the
gilded lake “cottages“ of weekenders, but the practical smaller abodes, where
one dwells year round.</p>
<p>The south-western windows view the wooded shoreline, by guess, our house is
amongst the elder on this side of the shore.  I’d imagine the view once looked
into a woods; now spotted with neighbors houses—year round homes for most.</p>
<p>This quiet lake has shrunk this year, lacking the replenishing rainfalls.  This
snow, doomed to soon melt, will feed and restore a bit.  Yet today, if
predictions hold, we might see a day’s worth of snow cover, and dropping leaves,
surrendering to the weight of coming winter.</p>
<p>As for me?  Beside me rests old Ollie, now 11, content to rest his head on a
pillow we share.  He, like all our dogs, alive and gone, love snow with a
childlike joy.</p>
<p>Ollie, a steady companion, whose coat itself we’ve used in a game:
“Where’s Ollie?”  In years past, and in prior home, he’d go afield and I’d snap
a photo amidst the snow and ask folks to find Ollie.  A challenging task given
his white with a few steel gray and brown spots.</p>
<p>Lacey one day from 4 years old, rests upon a chair.  She curls tight, waiting
for Jenny to awake and join on her lap.  Four years and eleven days ago, her
mom, her 10 day old litter mates, and her, arrived at our house.  We fostered
them until they were old enough for their adoptive parents to take them home.
She loves snow, burying her nose to find what scents lurk—mice and vole making
their way amidst the blanketing cover.</p>
<p>Both would play frisbee if I’d ask; though tossing a disc in which snow sticks
and packs, makes for a more dangerous sport.  So maybe a walk once all of this
house awaken.  For now, me, I think I’ll end this little bit of writing and
enjoy another coffee.</p>
