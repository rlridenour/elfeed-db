<p>TIL that multiple cursor's <em>mc/insert-numbers</em> enables you to quickly enter increasing numbers for each cursor. I have <em>mc/insert-numbers</em> bound to # in <em>region-bindings-mode-map.</em> By default, sequence starts at 0, but invoking <em>mc/insert-numbers</em> with prefix enables you to quickly change that.</p>
<p>Came in handy when numbering an org table:</p>
