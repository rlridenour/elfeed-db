<p>Add <code>detach-keys = &quot;ctrl-@,ctrl-q&quot;</code> to <code>[engine]</code> section in <code>~/.config/containers/containers.conf</code> file</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>I recently switched to Podman and the only issue I faced is CTRL+P won&rsquo;t work properly inside containers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly the same issue I had with Docker, described in my <a href="https://codelearn.me/2018/03/01/docker-terminal-navigation.html">Docker detach keys</a> post.</p>
<p>The solution from that post doesn&rsquo;t work since it was purely docker-specific configuration file.</p>
<p>In case of Podman the configuration file is <code>~/.config/containers/containers.conf</code>.</p>
<p>The line that must be added is <code>detach_keys = &quot;ctrl-@,ctrl-q&quot;</code> (feel free to choose any other sequence).</p>
<p>The line must be added under <code>[engine]</code> table.</p>
<p>When this is done <code>ctrl-p</code> is not going to be a keybinding that starts an escape sequence.</p>
