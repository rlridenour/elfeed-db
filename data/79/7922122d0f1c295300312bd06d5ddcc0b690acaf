<p>TikTok says it has finalized a deal to create a new U.S.-focused entity, a move designed to avert a shutdown or ban tied to long-running U.S. national security concerns over its Chinese ownership. Under the arrangement, a consortium of mostly American investors will hold roughly four-fifths of the new venture, while ByteDance will retain a minority stake. TikTok says the new setup will include safeguards around U.S. user data and the recommendation algorithm, aiming to keep the app available for its large U.S. user base while regulators and lawmakers scrutinize the details.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/EE0dv5ogINX-SbVx174c8GYv8CUPF3J9IslfWb4D_XXah6SkZNE4erF9xy9Vb3z-lAWGaR_Ymc4IqIbSCxn3oX4XFHBnUKbtNUiRg6F76aCWocPL28POPDVjg3hGcXt_SDraaaHf-HCkxKjfuchEhMlvFgngfYzWYXYfWFEJ3feJzyo-nboyCzAPuwWNBf4VKkyPggWMaM79kNRs15Vj7nnntgdNSJygRO9TJbKZ5nbSB0HRZ35Ktw6jFQWn' alt='Flags of China and the US are seen near the logo of TikTok owner ByteDance in an illustration photo (September 18, 2020).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>New leadership: TikTok said Adam Presser, previously a senior operations and trust-and-safety executive, will serve as CEO of the new TikTok U.S. venture.</li><li>Governance plan: The company said the U.S. venture will be overseen by a seven-member board with a majority of American directors, and will include TikTok CEO Shou Chew among its members.</li><li>Investment size: Politico reported the investor group closed a $14 billion deal to control the U.S. version of TikTok, but said key details still have not been made public.</li><li>Algorithm handling: TikTok said the new owners will retrain, test and update recommendations on U.S. user data, though Politico said compliance with the 2024 law remains unclear.</li><li>User message: The Straits Times reported that Shou Chew thanked users as TikTok said it had secured the platform’s future in the U.S., while he continues to run TikTok globally.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>TikTok: The company says the U.S. joint venture includes defined safeguards such as data protections, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurances for U.S. users.
