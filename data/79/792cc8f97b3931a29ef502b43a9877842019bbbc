<p>A group of Australian servicewomen launched a class-action lawsuit in the Federal Court on 24 October 2025 alleging widespread and systemic sexual violence, harassment and discrimination across the Australian Defence Force, and lawyers say they expect thousands of women to join the claim . The case was served against the commonwealth and, according to court documents, allows any woman who experienced sexual violence, sexual harassment or discrimination while employed by the ADF between 12 November 2003 and 25 May 2025 to participate . Four lead applicants (names withheld for legal reasons) include current and former air force and navy members who describe abuse during training, on deployment and in workplace settings . Plaintiffs’ lawyers say the action seeks accountability for systemic cultural failures inside the defence force and to spotlight long‑standing problems in how complaints were handled .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/hpcxnJOHouyKCDJ1dbUpG8AKPYPcfZOayWcdBrqfddDmEnwWm-Q58Nbc524WlCO4Lq90n6PoKOzeJtskuTVF7lUAwBg1_tAfuywbfYd_4xNq1XkskWXmmwQTNFTbpLgSAwg_GgJlEE_ywwIcLFn86zabJF5diWsxq31zjrs1zH4P1aPfLuWunZpDV8dSwE9Au1HOiv1tz_TxtkG7hpIK3xqGXx8SbZnEfMsxIg0GxQmgpHKfC2E8vTB6teA' alt='Serving in the defence force was initially &quot;a dream come true&quot; for Rebecca McGaw.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Allegations detail: Applicants describe a range of misconduct including sexist and hostile comments, unsolicited pornographic images, unwanted touching, and a forced kiss while on duty overseas .</li><li>Branches affected: Lead claimants come from the air force and navy and report abuse during training courses, on deployments and in daily workplace interactions .</li><li>Time span: The class action covers a 21-year period of alleged misconduct from November 2003 through May 2025, creating a broad window for potential claimants .</li><li>Legal target: Plaintiffs have served the claim against the Commonwealth, marking an unusual large-scale legal step aimed at government responsibility for the ADF’s workplace culture .</li></ul><blockquote>The threat of war often isn’t the biggest safety fear for female ADF personnel; it is the threat of sexual violence in their workplace - Josh Aylward</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Lead applicants&#x27; lawyers: Female members of the military shouldn’t have to fight off their colleagues on a daily basis.
