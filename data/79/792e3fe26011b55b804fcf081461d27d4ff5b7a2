The firmware has a build number of 8A356, and it replaces the current 7E93 firmware.<br/>
<br/>
With Apple's new software updates, the AirPods Pro 2 and the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; support better audio quality for phone calls and video calls, and studio-quality audio recording for interviews, podcasts, videos, and more.<br/>
<br/>
There is an option to use the AirPods as a camera remote with the Camera app to take photos or start a video recording, and you can now get the AirPods to pause audio if you fall asleep while listening. A Keep Audio in Headphones feature ensures that your music won't switch to your car when you get in, and you can now get charging reminders when your AirPods battery is low. On the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; with ANC and the AirPods Pro 2, Live Translation is supported. <br/>
<br/>
All of these features will also be available with the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a> that are releasing on Friday, September 19. <br/>
<br/>
To install the new firmware, make sure your AirPods are in range of your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac.
