<p>Iranian authorities have signaled a deeper crackdown following nationwide unrest, with state messaging warning people accused of joining what officials call “riots” to surrender and face punishment if they do not. Multiple outlets report that the government has maintained a sweeping internet shutdown that has limited information leaving the country and complicated independent verification. Human rights groups and activists cited by several publications estimate the death toll from the security response in the thousands, alongside large-scale detentions, while reporting continues to emerge in fragments. Against that backdrop, some reporting also describes growing unease and internal strains within parts of Iran’s ruling establishment as evidence of the bloodshed mounts.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/w80ZVvqmFFCvMjr3uNJbZt6nm3JTmKrzeSyklUsUqMM59kf2gu4-NnFUfB5njmUTsm6PqLGR9hrzBZXY6NoWKiO_90BgXxT4WupH-il1Yo3PUPg-Np2Acp10l5z_Ftt6Upac9-6-QZiSS-3DZ8DqANJCRaZifjo02OlnKgsrv6Oxg_X7PMP9DhOBXxQKd6IWtpBJGGbbrzDS3rJc_ESVS3Aqm_GHDWEr3w8fccr3eJGHrQ1RC_1wvhG3-mCSqvrjJA' alt='The state tax building, burned during Iran&#x27;s protests, on a street in Tehran, Iran, January 19, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Asset seizures: Authorities have described confiscating assets from people accused of backing protesters, framing it as a way to cover property damage tied to the unrest.</li><li>Activist estimates: A US-based group, Human Rights Activists News Agency, has publicly put the reported death toll above 4,000 and said it expects the figure to rise as more information leaks out.</li><li>NGO verification: Iran Human Rights, cited by Le Monde, said it had verified 3,428 deaths and warned the actual toll could be much higher.</li><li>Nobel voice: In RFE/RL’s continuing live coverage, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi is quoted arguing the Islamic Republic is “fundamentally irreparable,” reflecting a strand of opposition sentiment.</li><li>Regime tensions: The Economist reports that the killings have unsettled parts of the country and some officials, describing rising tensions within the governing system after the crackdown.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iranian authorities: Officials characterize the unrest as “riots,” warn participants to surrender, and describe punitive measures including asset confiscation tied to protest-related damage.
