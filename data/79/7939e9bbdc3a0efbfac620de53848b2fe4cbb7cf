&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; support comes more than 15 years after the messaging service launched. In September, Meta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/whatsapp-beta-native-ipad-support/">started beta testing</a> WhatsApp for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; via TestFlight.<br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp allows users of the encrypted messaging platform to link up to four devices to their account even when their main smartphone is not connected to the internet. Each linked device connects to WhatsApp independently, ensuring that personal messages, media, and calls are end-to-end encrypted.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to WhatsApp, Meta owns Facebook, Threads, and Instagram. There is an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app for Facebook, but the Threads app remains <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> only. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/instagram-ipad-app/">Instagram app for the iPad</a> is reportedly in the works.<br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997">available to download from the App Store</a> now.<br/>
