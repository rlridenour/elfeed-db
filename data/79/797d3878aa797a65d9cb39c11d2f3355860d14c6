<p>Greek authorities report that an inflatable dinghy carrying migrants across the Mediterranean was found half-sunken south of the island of Crete, with at least 17–18 people dead and two survivors rescued in critical condition. The vessel was first spotted on Saturday by a passing Turkish merchant ship about 40 kilometers south of the small Greek island of Chrysi, prompting a large search-and-rescue operation by the Hellenic Coast Guard, navy, and air force. Most of the victims were men who appear to have been trapped inside the boat’s lower section as it took on water, while the two rescued men were found on the surface and transported to a hospital in Crete. The incident is described by Greek media and officials as the country’s deadliest migrant shipwreck in roughly two years and highlights a growing shift in irregular migration routes from Libya toward Crete as an entry point to the European Union.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/sUYBnZ--MZ2p4EQHxJ8HwGJD6Dcf-ATFIODn9fLos9PFzqSgwQNg_927AfqxLQuOYosU1r4i0usE-TSX7qRTnzSHz1Tf3w-j-APi7vcRWU4zbz36cvTxN90N43ocKcRUsxOtjjeuE7svlign7aQkHHOPlj5_ug9jxsN_esW5i7t8fH56LdCWuA-4xrCtEiwB9h_cJqcm_ecCE9QzU1YtCRnj' alt='Greek firefighters and coastguard personnel respond after a migrant vessel sank off Crete.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Discovery at sea: The half-submerged dinghy was located after a Turkish-flagged cargo ship alerted Greek authorities upon spotting people in the water during its passage south of Crete.</li><li>Rescue response: The Hellenic Coast Guard deployed patrol vessels, a navy frigate, and aircraft to the area, ultimately recovering the bodies and airlifting the two survivors to a hospital in Ierapetra on Crete.</li><li>Conditions on board: Survivors told officials that the group had faced bad weather with no shelter, food, or drinking water while drifting before the vessel flooded.</li><li>Unknown departure point: Authorities have not yet confirmed the boat’s port of departure, though Greek officials suspect it likely left from the Libyan coast based on its position and recent route patterns.</li><li>Ongoing investigation: Greek prosecutors opened an inquiry into possible migrant smuggling and negligence, with investigators seeking to identify the dead and establish who organized the voyage.</li></ul><blockquote>They had no way to cover themselves, nor to eat or drink anything. - Unnamed survivor account relayed by Greek authorities</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Hellenic Coast Guard: Officials said the vessel appears to have taken on water and overturned while carrying an unknown number of migrants in rough conditions south of Crete, and that identifying the victims and establishing the route are now priorities.
