<p>As I&rsquo;m getting back into the &ldquo;groove&rdquo; of things, I started this pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wake up. Switch to home clothes from PJs.</li>
<li>Go to the kitchen, get some water, listen to the birds and think for a bit (about 10 mins)</li>
<li>Exercise: stretches (mostly focusing on back and posture), with some push-ups and crunches.</li>
<li>Meditation (5 mins) follows exercise</li>
<li>Back to the kitchen to make coffee and breakfast</li>
<li>Eat, take vitamins, talk to Nat as his morning starts as well</li>
<li>Start working:
<ol>
<li>View the agenda for the day (meetings, major projects, TODOs)</li>
<li>Looking for Pinned emails from previous days and Reminders, combine them into TODOs for the day</li>
<li>Start tackling tasks in my agenda (emacs org-mode), recording what I&rsquo;m doing in notes</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Around 13:00 to 15:00 (depending on meetings and things), time to exercise, or if I&rsquo;m in the office, go back home for this. No targeted goal specifically yet; it&rsquo;s mostly about the routine, but I&rsquo;m trying to include a jog here if I can, or weight lifting</li>
<li>Back to work: this is a good &ldquo;quiet time&rdquo; to work on projects without interruption, depending on meetings.</li>
<li>Around 18:00 or 19:00 finishing work. Nat&rsquo;s back at that time, or I spend time with another partner, depending on the day.</li>
<li>Around 20:00, I enjoy a show (these days it&rsquo;s Silo) or video games (Helldirvers2 mostly at this point, but there&rsquo;s also the excellent <a href="https://www.klei.com/games/mind-over-magic">Mind over Magic</a> I need to review soon)</li>
<li>I usually sleep around 22:00 or 23:00. Hopefully I can keep up the 7 hours of sleep I get a night or so, which means I wake up around 6:00 the next day to start again.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many points that change in this workflow (for example, if I blog, it&rsquo;s usually in the morning at some point after food, if work allows), but in general, this is the outline I try to get back to.</p>
<p>Once again I see the benefits of channeling all my tasks that come from emails, reminders, my calendar, phone calls, meeting etc - into my org-mode agenda, where I have one simple list without distractions of what I need to do. If it&rsquo;s not there, I&rsquo;m not doing it that day. And there&rsquo;s always more than I can finish each day anyway, that&rsquo;s just the nature of things.</p>
<p>The big benefit (I&rsquo;ve said so many times in the past) here is that because I log what I do, I know exactly what was done and I have a good idea of what needs to be done next. This is also very useful when there&rsquo;s a new project, and you can just use the template from last time. Good stuff.</p>
