<p>Adam Serwer, reporting from the streets of Minneapolis for The Atlantic, “Minnesota Proved MAGA Wrong” (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The secret fear of the morally depraved is that virtue is actually
common, and that they’re the ones who are alone. In Minnesota, all
of the ideological cornerstones of MAGA have been proved false at
once. Minnesotans, not the armed thugs of ICE and the Border
Patrol, are brave. Minnesotans have shown that their community is
socially cohesive — because of its diversity and not in spite of
it. Minnesotans have found and loved one another in a world
atomized by social media, where empty men have tried to fill their
lonely soul with lies about their own inherent superiority.
Minnesotans have preserved everything worthwhile about “Western
civilization,” while armed brutes try to tear it down by force.</p>
