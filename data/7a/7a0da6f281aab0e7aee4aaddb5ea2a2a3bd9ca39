  <p>Theater, the premier platform for spatial media, cinema and events
on Apple Vision Pro, is proud to announce the immersive livestream
of The Talk Show Live from WWDC on Tuesday, June 10, 2025.</p>

<p>Following last year’s groundbreaking first-ever immersive
livestream of the event from John Gruber, host of The Talk Show
podcast and author of the renowned Apple blog Daring Fireball,
Theater returns with an enhanced experience that builds on a full
year of platform development and partnerships.</p>

<p>“When we launched Theater last year to showcase The Talk Show
Live, we weren’t just experimenting — we were inviting people to
experience a new kind of immersion. Bringing Apple executives into
spatial media wasn’t just a world first; it was a glimpse of how
shared experiences can transcend screens,” said Adam Lisagor, CEO
and founder of Sandwich Vision. “This year, we’re not just adding
features — we’re refining how people can feel connected, curious,
and delighted together, again and again. Our goal is to make
presence and participation the new standard for special events,
where technology fades away, and what remains is the shared magic
of being there.”</p>

<p>The livestream will be available in both 2D and 3D formats. While
the 2D stream will be offered free of charge, the premium 3D
immersive experience will be available for $11.99 for tickets
purchased in advance, increasing to $14.99 on the day of the
event. All ticket holders will receive permanent access to a
pristine 6K version of the event to watch forever.</p>

<p>Make your purchases right in the <a href="https://theater.sandwich.vision/">Theater app</a>. I’m snarky in the press release linked above, but I actually thought doing this last year was incredibly cool. Afterwards it was like I got to watch myself perform my own show, which was a lot weirder than just watching myself on regular video.</p>

<p>If you can make the show, <a href="https://ti.to/daringfireball/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2025">you really should attend</a>. Everyone tells me it’s fun. But if you can’t make the show, you definitely should watch live in Theater.</p>
