<p>Joe Biden, 82, is undergoing radiation therapy alongside hormone treatment as part of his prostate cancer care plan, his team confirmed on Saturday [aljazeera.com#12][bbc.com#7][scmp.com#8]. The course of radiation is expected to run for about five weeks, marking a new stage in his treatment [abc.net.au#5]. Biden was diagnosed in May with an aggressive prostate cancer that had spread to his bones; his team has described the cancer as hormone-sensitive, meaning it is likely to respond to therapy [dw.com#3][firstpost.com#6][thehindu.com#2]. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men and the second leading cause of cancer death in men, according to the American Cancer Society [dawn.com#10].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PZn2iL3kffBTh85gIzd5lqdFFJgnXMBBgVGKB87jtMmkHmrmfrYLWJH6YWJnU4oI8QKGzQe_L3h5xAf4VxBMAg0bRuU3B0iSclEtSPOeui2piVy1mvMPZWM29rXmfNp_KET6W4XWJh1ZyV_U_SXXyT3yUjeU7bzIg3ToCs6YJhy7zp6uDWy82ypbeQfd9Ak65GoanhZUx4XsNZGxnSfxqaZOW6ZmPOb873T392CXF_xerQyJW_OCXLEpzw' alt='A five-week course of radiation is part of Biden’s current treatment plan.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Treatment plan: Biden is receiving both radiation therapy and hormone therapy as part of a coordinated plan, his spokesperson said [aljazeera.com#12][bbc.com#7][scmp.com#8].</li><li>Duration noted: Radiation is expected to continue for five weeks, described as a new stage of care [abc.net.au#5].</li><li>Cancer profile: Doctors characterized the illness as aggressive but hormone-sensitive, suggesting it is likely to respond to treatment [thehindu.com#2].</li><li>Disease spread: The diagnosis announced in May indicated the cancer had spread to his bones [dw.com#3][firstpost.com#6].</li><li>Context for readers: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men and the second leading cause of cancer death in men [dawn.com#10].</li></ul><blockquote>Thank you for lifting us up with love and support. - Joe Biden</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Biden’s office (Kelly Scully, aide): Confirmed Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment as part of his plan.
