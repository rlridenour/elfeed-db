<p>Today&nbsp;<a href="https://agiletortoise.com/terminology/"><strong>Terminology</strong></a>, Greg Pierce’s word app, gets a major update. It’s a complete overhaul, marking the most significant update since its original release in 2010.</p>



<p>Terminology is a powerful and extensible reference tool that goes beyond a standard dictionary. It starts with an offline, WordNet-based dictionary and allows you to seamlessly browse and configure online resources for deeper research.</p>



<p>With support for customizable AI prompts, enhanced note-taking, and multiple-term lists, it&#8217;s designed for writers, researchers, and language enthusiasts who want more control over their word exploration. The latest update modernizes the app with SwiftUI and integrates an actively maintained word database.</p>



<p>With this release, Terminology also introduces a Pro tier. Subscribers gain access to features like custom resources, multiple-term lists, and advanced note-taking capabilities.</p>



<p>At launch, there&#8217;s a limited-time pricing offer: </p>



<p>• $4.99 per year as a renewable subscription </p>



<p>• $19.99 for a one-time lifetime unlock or <a href="https://agiletortoise.com/terminology/">Terminology</a>.</p>



<p><em>Those prices will eventually get increase</em>.</p>
