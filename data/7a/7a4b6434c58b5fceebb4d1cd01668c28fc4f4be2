<p>After posting <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/19/photoshop-1-source-code">a link</a> to the Computer History Museum’s <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/adobe-photoshop-source-code/">release of the Photoshop 1.0 source code</a> last week, I spent some time paging through the original Photoshop manuals. I found a screenshot of the dialog box where you entered your serial number, and posted it to Mastodon, writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re annoyed by something that is obviously wrong about this
dialog box from Photoshop 1.0, you’re my type of person. (Even
more so if, like me, you remember being annoyed by this at the
time, when you were entering your cracked SN.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a lovely thread it generated, replete with screenshots from early versions of the HIG.</p>

<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> I would eat my hat if Alan Dye knew what was wrong and gross about this dialog box. This is exactly the sort of <em>sweating the idiomatic usability details</em> thing that has frequently been wrong in Apple software in the last decade. The response from Dye and those in his cohort would be, I’d wager, to roll their eyes with a “<em>Who gives a shit what the UI guidelines were forty fucking years ago?</em>” dismissal. Here’s the thing. <em>Styles</em> have changed as time has marched on. Technical capabilities — screen resolution, color — have marched on. But the fundamental idioms of good Macintosh UI design are timeless (and many of them ought to apply to Apple’s other platforms). These idioms are like grammar. Slang changes. Language forever moves forward. But many important idioms are so fundamental they do not change. Styles and technical advances have advanced over time in filmmaking and print design too, but the basic principles of good cinema and graphic layout are timeless. Only a fool dismisses the collective knowledge passed down by those who came before us. </p>
