<p>Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy entered La Santé prison in Paris on Tuesday to start a five-year sentence after being convicted of criminal conspiracy for seeking illegal financing for his 2007 campaign from Muammar Gaddafi’s Libya [theguardian.com#1][abcnews.go.com#2][aljazeera.com#1]. Sarkozy, who governed from 2007 to 2012, maintains his innocence, has appealed, and says the case is politically motivated; under French rules for this sentence, the appeal does not delay incarceration [bbc.com#1][newarab.com#1]. The court found he conspired with aides to obtain funds but acquitted him of personally receiving or using the money [newarab.com#1]. His jailing marks a first for a postwar French leader and the first time a former head of an EU country has served time in prison [theguardian.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JW2S3qNoTWBlrg2fpEVrxiuLM1SlM7tOxDShuheoP9lDO3ag-bcl-taRGgPoiZcQx-IH_qmrORSQHh1wwGfuIMhCCzbMgyC6MV10enBytq2I0Wh3FqM9vl-h7ZrNpgFKmfIW5Y9Gigm1Pa4mVq5322M4Lc05gFPGciOIBRaf3LXawiVen7zudGwfrD6UTL3ao8A9xBOtGQJ2hzOxt0oBmumLW6o93-7BzS7JSMcH6N04eYvbrMtFffv6LeQsyNZS4oPHVjQqvIAEvUn29A' alt='Nicolas Sarkozy leaves his Paris home with Carla Bruni before heading to La Santé prison.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Prison conditions: Sarkozy is expected to be held in isolation for security, with access to a TV, landline and a private shower; he reportedly brought a copy of The Count of Monte Cristo [theguardian.com#2][newarab.com#1].</li><li>Legal steps: His lawyers have appealed the verdict and filed a request for early release even as he begins serving his term [cbsnews.com#1][lemonde.fr#1].</li><li>Public reaction: A France 24 report cites polling showing roughly 6 in 10 French people consider the decision fair, underscoring a divided national response [france24.com#3].</li><li>Prior conviction: In a separate corruption case, Sarkozy was previously convicted and served the sentence under electronic monitoring rather than in prison [newarab.com#1].</li><li>Send-off scene: He left home hand-in-hand with his wife Carla Bruni as supporters chanted his name and sang La Marseillaise before he was driven to La Santé [theglobeandmail.com#1][arabnews.com#1][france24.com#10].</li></ul><blockquote>I&#x27;m not afraid of prison.
