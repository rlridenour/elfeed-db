         
         <p>I just added a new command to rotate across a list of Modus themes:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-rotate</code>. In interactive use, it uses the value of the
new user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-to-rotate</code>. When called from Lisp, it
accepts any list that consists of Modus themes.</p>

<p>The way I implemented this feature, we get the following behaviour:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check which is the current Modus theme and find its position in the
list of the themes that are in rotation.</li>
  <li>Move to the next item on the list, reading from left to right.</li>
  <li>If the next item is the current theme, move to the one after.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a nice little command that complements the existing
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-toggle</code> (switch between two themes, per
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-to-toggle</code>) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-select</code> (choose a theme
from the entire family using minibuffer completion).</p>

<p>The new functionality will be available to all users as part of Modus
themes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4.6.0</code>. If you do try it before then, let me know if something
is amiss.</p>
