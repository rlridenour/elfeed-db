<p id="p1">On Sunday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg&rsquo;s Mark Gurman published</a> a comprehensive recap of Apple&rsquo;s AI troubles. There wasn&rsquo;t much new in Gurman&rsquo;s story, except quotes from unnamed sources that added to the sense of conflict playing out inside the company. That said, it&rsquo;s perfect if you haven&rsquo;t been paying close attention since Apple Intelligence was first announced last June.</p>
<p id="p2">What&rsquo;s troubling about Apple&rsquo;s predicament isn&rsquo;t that Apple&rsquo;s super mom and other AI illustrations looks like they were generated in 2022, a lifetime ago in the world of AI. The trouble is what the company&rsquo;s struggles mean for next-generation interactions with devices and productivity apps. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/notes-on-the-apple-intelligence-delay/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The promise</a> of natural language requests made to Siri that combine personal context with App Intents is exciting, but it&rsquo;s mired in multiple layers of technical issues that need to be solved starting, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Gurman reported</a>, with Siri.</p>
<p id="p3">The mess is so profound that it raises the question of whether Apple has the institutional capabilities to fix it. <a href="https://spyglass.org/theres-no-free-lunch-at-apple/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As M.G. Siegler wrote yesterday on Spyglass</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  Apple, as an organization, simply doesn&rsquo;t seem built correctly to operate in the age of AI. This technology, even more so than the web, moves insanely fast and is all about iteration.&nbsp;<a href="https://spyglass.org/apple-ai-is-here-kinda/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple likes to move slowly</a>, measuring a million times and cutting once.&nbsp;<a href="https://spyglass.org/is-apple-intelligence-ready/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shipping polished jewels</a>. That&rsquo;s just not going to cut it with AI.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">Having studied the fierce competition among AI companies for months, I agree with Siegler. This isn&rsquo;t like hardware where Apple has successfully entered a category late and dominated it. Hardware plays to Apple&rsquo;s design and supply chain strengths. In contrast, the rapid iteration of AI models and apps is the antithesis of Apple&rsquo;s annual OS cycle. It&rsquo;s a fundamentally different approach driven by intense competition and fueled by billions of dollars of cash.</p>
<p id="p6">I tend to agree with Siegler that given where things stand, Apple should replace a lot of Siri&rsquo;s capabilities with a third-party chatbot and in the longer-term make an acquisition to shake up how it approaches AI. However, I also think the chances of either of those things happening are unlikely given Apple&rsquo;s historical focus on internally developed solutions.</p>
