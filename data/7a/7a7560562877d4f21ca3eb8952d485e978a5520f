I wanted to start postgresql at startup, because I always end up starting it anyway. As a main-stream application I found it on the list:
sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service Then I enabled it.
sudo systemctl enable postgresql Done!
If it hadn&rsquo;t been on the list I suppose I would have had to make my own unit file for it, thereby adding it to the list.
