<p>There's a corner in Chinatown hosting some truly superb treats. If you get caught in the rush between Newport court and Newport place, you'd likely fail to notice some the awesome street food stands.</p>

<h2>Chilly squid</h2>
<p>I've walked past this place many times and never noticed it. They serve a handful of items, but the grilled chilly squid skewers caught my attention. They're grilled, brushed with chilly sauce and finished with sprinkled sesame and cumin seeds. Super tasty.</p>

<h2>Pancake + Crisp + Egg + Hot chillies = Jiān Bǐng 煎餅</h2>
<p>I first had these delicious breakfast savory pancakes at a Beijing street food stall. Never expected to randomly find Jiān Bǐng in London. It's a crepe with an additional egg spread, hoisin sauce, chilly sauce, hot chillies, topped with spring onions and coriander, all wrapping a wonderfully crispy bread cracker. And.. it's awesome.</p>

<h2>Tai Yaki</h2>
<p>Chinatown Bakery is hard to miss. Pedestrian traffic slows down as we all fall under the spell of the Tai Yaki machine. This wonderful assembly line produces fish-shaped sweet waffles filled with custard. They are the perfect dessert after some savory street snacks. You can get a bag of 4 for £2.</p>

<h2>All near each other</h2>
<p>All these delights are within a stone's throw away from each other.</p>

<h2>Better suggestion?</h2>
<p>London is full of overhyped, gimmicky, and unnecessarily expensive restaurants. Very few deliver truly awesome food (even those expensive ones). Got suggestions? I'd love to hear from you <a href="https://twitter.com/xenodium">@xenodium</a>.</p>
