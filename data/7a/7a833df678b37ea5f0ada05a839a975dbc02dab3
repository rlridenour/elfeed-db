A fourth Apple artificial intelligence expert has left the company to join Meta, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-29/apple-loses-ai-models-engineer-bowen-zhang-to-meta-superintelligence-team">Bloomberg</a></em>. Bowen Zhang, who was on Apple's foundation models team, is the latest employee to abandon Apple for Meta.<br/>

The leader of Apple's foundation models group, Ruoming Pang, was one of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/apple-ai-executive-leaves-for-meta/">first Apple AI researchers to join Meta</a>. Since then, several employees who worked under him have also left for Meta. Meta is aggressively hiring for its Superintelligence Labs, an AI division that's building advanced AI systems capable of performing at or beyond human-level intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been offering AI engineers massive compensation packages to lure them from other companies, and Pang reportedly received over &#36;200 million. Pay from Meta reportedly includes a high base salary, a signing bonus, and stock awards, and the money offered to Pang exceeds the compensation of almost all Apple employees except for executives. Presumably, the other AI engineers that left Apple have also received offers that Apple isn't willing to match.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta had been offering signing bonuses as high as &#36;100 million. Meta has hired engineers and AI experts from Apple, OpenAI, and Anthropic. <em>Bloomberg</em> says Apple is "marginally increasing" the pay of its foundation models team, but is not paying at the level that Meta is.<br/>
<br/>
With Apple losing key employees to Meta, it could continue to struggle to catch up in the AI race. Competitors like Google and Samsung have much more advanced AI features already, and this year, Apple was forced to delay promised <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> features until 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been restructuring its AI teams, with AI efforts now overseen by Apple software chief Craig Federighi and Mike Rockwell, who led <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> development. Rumors suggest that Apple is considering using technology from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/">Anthropic or OpenAI</a> for future AI features, including an LLM version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, rather than its own models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's discussions to rely on third-party AI technology have reportedly led to falling morale on the foundation models team that is now losing employees to Meta. Multiple engineers are reportedly actively interviewing for jobs at other AI companies, while Apple executives are aiming to reassure team members that it remains committed to in-house AI development.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/29/apple-continues-losing-ai-experts-to-meta/">Apple Continues Losing AI Experts to Meta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continues-losing-ai-experts-to-meta.2462442/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
