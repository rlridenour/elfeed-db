<p id="p1">The Iconfactory&rsquo;s Craig Hockenberry had <a href="https://furbo.org/2025/08/17/liquid-glass-why/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interesting post over the weekend on Furbo.org</a> that struck a chord with me. The post explores the &lsquo;why&rsquo; surrounding Liquid Glass contrasting the upcoming iOS 26 changes with the transition from iOS 6 to iOS 7. That earlier change was driven by a need to make app design accessible to more people, which, <a href="https://furbo.org/2025/08/17/liquid-glass-why/" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Hockenberry explains</a>, seems different from the motivation behind Liquid Glass:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  I&rsquo;m unaware of anyone outside of Apple who&rsquo;s thinking &ldquo;we really need to have more fluid glass in our designs&rdquo;. Of particular note during the introduction is how much time they spend showing off glass blocks and talking about the physical effect itself. While not addressing the most important question: &ldquo;why do we need this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>  And I&rsquo;m pretty sure the answer is &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t&rdquo;. The answer is &ldquo;Apple does.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p3">Hockenberry thinks the switch to Liquid Glass is being driven by unreleased hardware very much like the iOS 11 safe areas that were instituted before the iPhone X&rsquo;s notch and Home indicator debuted. It&rsquo;s a great theory that could easily have people facepalming in the not-too-distant future. I hope he&rsquo;s right.</p>
