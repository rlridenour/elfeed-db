<p>Police in San Joaquin County say a shooting during a child’s birthday party at a family banquet hall in Stockton, northern California, left four people dead and ten others wounded on Saturday evening, with victims ranging from children to adults. The attack began shortly before 6pm local time when dispatchers received multiple reports of gunfire near a hall on the city’s east side, where relatives had gathered to celebrate. Investigators believe the assault was likely targeted rather than random, but they have not yet identified a suspect or established a clear motive, and they have appealed to the public for videos and witness accounts to help reconstruct what happened. Local hospitals received the injured guests for emergency treatment, and state authorities including California’s governor have been briefed as police stress that the inquiry is still in its early stages.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/E17QIe9dWKvVX_7ms_PwRbbwdliGY67l9fQdEGnRsv-ZP5qWO2MAswLvCaO4snR19dVF-ZPGJ0fRXL39eUmU_FzOFYUtARgBjN23XMpiqmyH' alt='Police officers work at the scene outside a Stockton banquet hall after multiple people were shot during a family celebration.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Nature of event: San Joaquin County sheriff’s officials described the incident as a shooting inside a rented banquet space where one extended family was holding a private celebration, rather than a public event or street gathering.</li><li>Victim profile: Authorities said those shot included juveniles as well as adults, indicating that both children and older relatives at the party were among the casualties taken to area hospitals.</li><li>Police response: Sheriff’s deputies, assisted by local police, secured the hall, canvassed the surrounding neighborhood for shell casings and surveillance footage, and set up a dedicated tip line asking residents to share any images or videos from the evening.</li><li>Investigative focus: Detectives are examining whether the gunfire came from one or more shooters, how they entered and exited the venue, and whether any of the guests had been previously threatened, while still publicly labeling the case as a possible targeted attack.</li><li>National context: The nonprofit Gun Violence Archive counts more than 500 mass shooting incidents in the United States so far this year, using a definition of four or more people shot in a single event excluding the shooter, placing the Stockton attack within a wider national pattern of such violence.</li></ul><blockquote>We have 14 victims of this shooting.
