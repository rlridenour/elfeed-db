Riley Testut, known for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-game-emulator-iphone/">Delta Game Emulator</a> and AltStore, today announced <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/altstore.io/post/3lsjdaavcps2y">the upcoming launch</a> of a new app called Delta Camera. Delta Camera is a standalone app that is meant to mimic the style of the Game Boy Camera.<br/>

The interface mirrors the Game Boy Camera, as do the photos that it captures. Though the images have a retro vibe, the app includes modern features like Camera Control support, front and rear camera integration, manual exposure, and zoom options.<br/>
<br/>
The Game Boy Camera is a Game Boy add-on that first came out in 1998. It takes grayscale images and supports editing and drawing features.<br/>

Testut plans to launch the app later this year, but it is available now for those who subscribe to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/introducing-best-132346071">the AltStore Patreon</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/26/delta-emulator-game-boy-camera/">Delta Emulator Developer Recreates Retro Game Boy Camera Experience on iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/delta-emulator-developer-recreates-retro-game-boy-camera-experience-on-iphone.2459756/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
