<p>How many college graduates end up getting their undergraduate degree in the major they declared when they initially started college?</p>
<p><span id="more-52936"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the questions taken up in a new study, &#8220;<span class="field-wrapper publication__title publication__title--full"><a href="https://www.amacad.org/publication/matriculation-completion-how-college-students-move-between-majors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Matriculation to Completion: How College Students Move Between Majors</a>.&#8221; The study is </span>by <a href="https://www.amacad.org/humanities-indicators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humanities Indicators</a>, based on an analysis by <a href="https://www.studentclearinghouse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Student Clearinghouse</a>, and focuses on students who entered college in 2017.</p>
<p>The study asked &#8220;whether college students who start a humanities degree are more or less likely to finish it than those who start other majors, and how the movement into and out of humanities majors compares to those of other fields of study.&#8221;</p>
<p>It looked both at broad categories (e.g., humanities, natural sciences, engineering, business, etc.) as well as individual majors within the humanities. Among its findings regarding the humanities as a whole:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost two million students started working toward a bachelor’s degree in fall 2017; of that number, 91,751 (4.6%) selected a primary major in one of the humanities disciplines. An average of around 7.5% of the bachelor’s degrees awarded from 2017 to 2022 were in the humanities. The difference between matriculations and degrees is explained by the humanities gaining more majors from other fields than it lost to either attrition or its own students switching to another major.</li>
<li>Students who start their studies in a humanities discipline are slightly more likely to complete a bachelor’s degree within seven years than college students generally (and even more likely to do so if they completed an associate’s degree before starting at a four-year institution).</li>
<li>Among students who completed a degree in a humanities discipline, more than half (55%) had started their studies in another major—either a nonhumanities field or a general liberal arts major.</li>
<li>Of the almost 92,000 students who began their studies with a major in the humanities, 49,808 (54%) finished with a degree in the humanities. This was slightly below the rates at which students completed their degree in their original major in other fields, including in engineering (58%) and business (57%), but similar to the rates for students starting in the arts, social and behavioral sciences, and health and medical sciences. The humanities’ rate was substantially higher than that of education or the natural sciences (both around 46%).</li>
</ul>
<p>What about particular majors? The following table shows the proportion of students who stuck with or switched out of their majors (both primary and secondary majors were taken into account).</p>

<p>As you can see, only 57% of the graduating students who started college declaring a major in philosophy ended up getting their BA in philosophy, while 12% switched to another humanities field, and 32% switched to a non-humanities field.</p>
<p>Seven of the eleven humanities fields studied are better at retaining their majors than philosophy, with communication, English, and History doing the best (around 70% retention).</p>
<p>This raises questions about what undergraduate philosophy programs can do to better keep their majors from switching to other disciplines.</p>
<p>The study also looked at the relationship between first and second majors. It reports that only 9% of students graduate with a second major. Around 16% of those second majors are in a humanities field. And those who are majoring in a humanities field are more likely than students in other areas to have a second major.</p>
