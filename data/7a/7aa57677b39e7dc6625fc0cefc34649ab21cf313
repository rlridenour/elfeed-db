<p>The United Nations and partner agencies launched a scaled‑back humanitarian appeal for 2026, seeking an initial $23 billion to provide lifesaving support to 87 million of the world’s most vulnerable people, even though they estimate that 135 million people should be targeted and 240 million are in need of emergency aid overall. The overall appeal, framed as a streamlined plan, could rise to $33 billion if donors step up, but UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said aid agencies had to make &quot;excruciating life-and-death choices&quot; after global donor funding fell sharply in 2025. The UN’s 2025 request for more than $45 billion was funded to only about $12 billion, its lowest level in a decade, forcing operations to cut assistance and leaving 25 million fewer people reached than planned. Officials link the retrenchment to large reductions in foreign aid budgets by major donors including the United States and several European countries, and note that the 2026 appeal now amounts to less than 1 percent of global military spending. Despite the sobering picture, UN leaders stress ongoing reforms to make aid delivery more efficient and express hope that clearer prioritisation, along with public awareness of suffering in conflict zones such as Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan, Haiti and Myanmar, will encourage governments and individuals to renew commitments.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/VZmJJCPpoRLF-gU4t-aheydaEah3lFIi8mpcLWhbKDM11UHXPzs_dH76lpWt6l5RrQPtRHQK0OW3oVboPmiINWfkH04PGOIGqVifnq_UckK7oB-m7vcx4zoXzjjGzVdJNHM6jJ3OEizVKEMBiZNjxMvZ6csqdFKjb4zrGTNc46NYGDzrkvJNYSBVVtg3ViHN' alt='UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher speaks as agencies warn of shrinking aid budgets.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Halved target: The 2026 appeal is roughly half the scale of the previous year’s $45‑billion request, reflecting a deliberate decision to ask for only what agencies believe can realistically be funded after recent shortfalls.</li><li>Apathy criticism: Tom Fletcher described 2025 as a period of &quot;brutality, impunity and indifference,&quot; accusing parts of the international community of apathy toward suffering even as needs grew from conflicts, disasters and epidemics.</li><li>US aid cuts: The UN appeal documents explicitly acknowledge that Washington’s decision under President Trump to slash foreign aid has made reaching earlier fundraising targets far more difficult, pushing planners to narrow the scope of operations.</li><li>Conflict hotspots: The new plan concentrates on people in the most dangerous contexts, highlighting Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan, Haiti and Myanmar as areas where violence and lawlessness have made aid both vital and harder to deliver.</li><li>Efficiency reforms: UN officials say they have overhauled aid planning to be more &quot;highly prioritised&quot; and efficient, hoping that demonstrable reforms will convince sceptical donors that every dollar will reach those facing the greatest risks.</li></ul><blockquote>This is a time when the rules are in retreat, when the scaffolding of coexistence is under sustained attack, when our survival antennae have been numbed by distraction and corroded by apathy - Tom Fletcher</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>UN humanitarian leadership: UN officials argue that shrinking the appeal and tightly prioritising programmes is the only way to protect the people facing the most extreme risks, while also signalling to donors that agencies are serious about reforms and value for money.
