<blockquote>
  <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was diagnosed Friday with an
aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones,
his office said in a statement on Sunday.</p>

<p>The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms,
which led doctors to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/biden-prostate.html">find a “small nodule”</a> on his
prostate. Mr. Biden’s cancer is “characterized by a Gleason
score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone,” the
statement said.</p>

<p>“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the
cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective
management,” according to the statement from Mr. Biden’s office,
which was unsigned. “The president and his family are reviewing
treatment options with his physicians.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Terrible news about a good man. But, man, does it feel like forever ago that he was president. It was only 118 days ago.</p>
