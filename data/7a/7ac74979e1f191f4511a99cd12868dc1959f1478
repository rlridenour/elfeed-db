Apple Immersive Videos are 3D videos recorded in 8K resolution, with a 180-degree field of view and Spatial Audio. For example, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/the-weeknd-vision-pro-music-experience/">recent performances by singer The Weeknd</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/metallica-concert-apple-vision-pro/">heavy metal band Metallica</a> are available in the format.<br/>
<br/>
The new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-immersive-video-utility/id6477489398">Apple Immersive Video Utility app</a> allows you to import, organize, package, and review Apple Immersive Video files on a Mac. Then, you can connect one or more Vision Pro devices and review the immersive videos. For larger groups, Apple says there is a synchronized playback option for multi-device viewing sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Immersive Video Utility is available for free <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-immersive-video-utility/id6477489398">in the App Store</a> for both macOS and visionOS, but it is currently limited to U.S. English.<br/>
