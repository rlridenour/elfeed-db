Chase this week <a href="https://media.chase.com/news/the-most-rewarding-cards-are-here">announced</a> a series of new perks for its premium Sapphire Reserve credit card, and one of them is for a pair of Apple services.<br/>

Specifically, the credit card now offers complimentary annual subscriptions to Apple TV+ and Apple Music, a value of up to &#36;250 per year. <br/>
<br/>
If you are already paying for Apple TV+ and/or Apple Music directly through Apple, those subscriptions will be automatically suspended and superseded by Chase's complimentary subscriptions during the offer period.<br/>
<br/>
The complimentary subscriptions run through June 22, 2027.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the perk does not extend to Apple One subscription bundles. If you currently pay for Apple One, you will continue to be charged on a monthly basis while your complimentary Apple TV+ and Apple Music subscriptions from Chase are active, so make sure to cancel that if you plan on taking advantage of the credit card perk.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the new perks, Chase has raised the annual fee of the Sapphire Reserve from &#36;550 to &#36;795, which effectively offsets the &#36;250 value of the complimentary Apple TV+ and Apple Music subscriptions. However, there is a <a href="https://creditcards.chase.com/rewards-credit-cards/sapphire/reserve">long list of additional perks</a>, and Chase says the card now offers more than &#36;2,700 in annual value.<br/>
<br/>
Chase is offering new Sapphire Reserve cardholders a welcome bonus of 100,000 points (which can exceed &#36;1,000 in value), as well as a &#36;500 travel credit, after they spend a minimum of &#36;5,000 in the first three months.<br/>
