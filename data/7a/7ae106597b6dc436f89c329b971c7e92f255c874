</ul><h1>Hydrate Better</h1><p>Hey, I’ve actually had these! So I can speak to their quality!</p>
<p>Additionally, we’ve sold this stuff a few times now, so some of you have weighed in too.</p>
<p>But before we get into it, I just need to clarify: with something like this, it’s all about context.</p>
<p>Would I say these Liquid Death drinks taste as good as, say, a mai tai? No. In fact, they’re not even my favorite electrolyte drink. That would be the kiwi strawberry Gatorlyte from Gatorade. But you know what? Those things come in a stupid plastic bottle and, even at my grocery store’s “sale” price, will run me about $2.50 each.</p>
<p>I don’t know about where you are, but here, it’s hot as all hell. And I go out into that heat to run between 4 and 7 miles, 5 days a week. Were I to drink a Gatorlyte after each run, it would start to get pretty expensive. Meanwhile, I can grab 36 of these for between $15 and $20 from right here on Meh. Which is a heck of a lot cheaper!</p>
<p>Not to mention, I’m not exactly drinking these things with a palate tuned for quaffing. No way, I’m bursting in the door, drenched in sweat, high on endorphins, looking to rehydrate fast. So, I house these things. The entire ordeal–filling the glass with water, mixing in the powder, and drinking the resultant drink–takes roughly one and a half minutes. So this stuff could be the most delicious drink in the world, or it could be durian-flavored, and I probably wouldn’t realize.</p>
<p>Okay, that’s an exaggeration. I actually do taste these things as I drink them. So here’s my take (and some of yours) on each flavor:</p>
<p><strong>Convicted Melon</strong> - It’s nice and smooth, with a pleasant sweetness that pushes right up the edge of being a Jolly Rancher in liquid form but doesn’t go over. For me, this one is the best.</p>
<p><strong>Severed Lime</strong> - <a href="/@TehErk">@TehErk</a> was not a fan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, for reasons known only to the idiots that did it, the Lime has artificial sweetener in it as well as pure cane sugar. Which completely ruins the taste (because all artificial sweeteners taste like licking pennies to me). I don’t like pennies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Just to clarify, the artificial sweetener referred to here is actually stevia, I believe, a natural sweetener that nonetheless tastes pretty weird, so the point here stands.)</p>
<p>Personally, I didn’t get the pennies from it. Yes, there is an odd little aftertaste here, but I didn’t mind it, and I enjoyed the mild citrus-y bitterness. But again, I’m drinking these things in about two glugs.</p>
<p><strong>Mango Chainsaw</strong> - Probably my least favorite, to be honest. There’s a bit of a chalky Emergen-C thing going on here that I don’t get from the others. That said, I recently mixed one up with ice water, and that seemed to dull the dustiness a little bit.</p>
<p>And besides, not everyone agrees with me.</p>
<p><a href="/@alwaysangry">@alwaysangry</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m annoyed there’s no options for just the MANGO flavor. That’d have been hella satisfying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="/@TimW">@TimW</a> agreed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mango is my favorite; it’s a bit sweeter maybe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what’s most important is that, at least for me, these do their job. After a grueling run, they help restore me. Is it possible that this is just a placebo effect? Maybe. But again, for less than a buck per packet, I’ll take something that tricks my brain into feeling a little better.</p>
<p>Point is: I like these. And you might too. So buy some.</p>
