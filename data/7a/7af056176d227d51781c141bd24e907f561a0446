<li>Two outlets, two USB ports on each one</li>
<li>The outlets rotate so you can plug stuff in with ease</li>
<li>Protects against the surge</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but with these, you could run four blenders at once (not that we recommend that)</li>
</ul><h1>Turn, Turn, Turn</h1><p>Yesterday? Cables that bend.</p>
<p>Today? Surge protectors with outlets that rotate.</p>
<p>Look, we just want you to plug shit in better, okay? Is that such a bad thing?</p>
<p>After all, we do supply you with a lot of stuff that requires plugging in. And let’s be honest, given our willingness to sling just about anything so long as it’s cheap, the products you get from us have a higher likelihood of coming with weirdly-shaped, bulky-ass plugs.</p>
<p>I know this from experience.</p>
<p>I bought a certain product from this very website a few years ago. I won’t name names except to say that it rhymes with a phrase that rhymes with “Libratone Zipp.”</p>
<p>It’s a great speaker! Has held up nicely, still sounds fantastic, holds a nice charge, and also has a zipper on it for some reason.</p>
<p>For a while, I wondered, why is the zipper there? I figured it was just a quirk, but then I realized it has a function: as long as you’re asking about the zipper, you’re distracted from how bulky and stupid its charger is.</p>
<p>Just take a look:</p>

<p>Seriously, there’s something rotten in the state of Denmark, and it’s their plug design. That thing’s a manspreader. It’s the person sitting next to you on the airplane who takes <em>both</em> armrests. You plug that thing, and <em>nothing</em> is going to fit next to it, above it, or anywhere near it.</p>
<p>Unless you’ve got something like one of these surge protectors!</p>
<p>Right? I actually don’t know. Maybe it’ll still be annoying.</p>
<p>But other things will fit with a little rotation. Plus, as the name implies, they provide surge protection. Plus, there are two outlets and two USB ports on each one.</p>
<p>Point is: they’re useful. And they look pretty cool.</p>
<p>Buy them, why don’t you?</p>
