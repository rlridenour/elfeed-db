<p>The US military says it carried out “large-scale” strikes across Syria targeting Islamic State positions on Saturday, describing them as retaliation for a December ambush near Palmyra that killed two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter. US Central Command said the operation aims to disrupt ISIS and help protect US and partner forces in the region. Officials did not provide full details on specific locations or results, but several outlets reported the strikes hit multiple ISIS targets around the country.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/1-kYdap5Yy_hXN9slXtjRxU-wVAyU5SFAkBb82NbXj3modsYaU-31d3cvvOfJ6Da5hs8zx-yuPJJy6SeAvcCxGcp-Csaww1jzRVTTZm4e1ZyVTgrhJ4Y5nYBSfkgRLEzFEqcV8lVGqH6hvnjtRGrDXn-HwXteZrLQywOJNjb-Hat301l-KAhxWDMsKfRZVvl-bx9GsfDpfl0ycOwW7Sw10NvtgZdVKjgVvA70wQIVTqTvK5hl1tWZk9H82__DHwvkfqeJw' alt='A US Airman attaches a GBU-31 munitions system to an F-15E Strike Eagle in the US Central Command area of responsibility, in support of Operation Hawkeye Strike, December 19, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Operation name: US Central Command said the latest wave is part of “Operation Hawkeye Strike,” which it launched after the Palmyra ambush.</li><li>Defense secretary message: US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth responded publicly to the strikes by posting, “We will never forget, and never relent”.</li><li>Prior strike round: CENTCOM previously said a US-Jordan round of strikes last month hit “more than 70 targets,” and a war monitor later reported at least five ISIS members killed, including a cell leader.</li><li>European allies action: Britain and France announced joint strikes on January 3 targeting an underground facility they said ISIS had likely used to store weapons.</li><li>Syria north ceasefire: CBS reported Syria announced a ceasefire with Kurdish fighters after three days of clashes in the north, separate from the Palmyra incident.</li></ul><blockquote>If you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, - U.S. Central Command</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Central Command: CENTCOM says the strikes targeted ISIS across Syria to prevent future attacks and protect US and partner forces.
