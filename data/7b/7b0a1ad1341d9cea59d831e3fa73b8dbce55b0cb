<li>Choose between three plain-looking models</li>
<li>They can track the weight for two users</li>
<li>Good for up to 400lb</li>
<li>Are they Mac compatible: If your Mac’s weight is fluctuating, you probably want to take it to the Genius Bar</li>
</ul><h1>Step On, Step Off</h1><p><strong>How to use your Health O Meter scale.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Put batteries into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step onto it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step off of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smell something burning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember the roast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm that the roast is fully burnt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Panic, because your boss, his wife, and Peter, your chief rival at work, are all coming over for dinner tonight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answer the doorbell when it rings, finding Peter is here early.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hang your head in defeat, knowing Peter will take this as an opportunity to applaud your downfall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marvel as Peter, surprisingly, does not applaud your downfall but instead rushes to the fridge and manages to concoct a gourmet menu from its contents that the two of you can cook together before the boss arrives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to contain your surprise when Peter reveals that he was once on an episode of <em>Chopped</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask him to repeat that when he says, “It was a special episode. All the competitors were firefighters with broken hearts. Just like me. At the time.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell him you didn’t know he used to be a firefighter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask him if his heart is still broken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read between the lines when he says, “Not anymore, no. In fact, there’s someone in my life now. Someone I see every day. She seems to think I’m her rival. And I let her think that because I’m glad she thinks of me at all.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Welcome your boss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proceed awkwardly through dinner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share a kiss with Peter after the boss and his wife leave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marry Peter. (Eventually.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set him up as the second user for your Health O Meter scale.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note: Steps 5 through 21 are optional. You do not need to marry your work rival to use a Health O Meter scale. But it does allow two users to track their weight.</em></p>
