<p>If there’s a silver lining to our tumultuous times, it’s that musicians are reviving the protest song, a tradition that has withered since the end of the Vietnam War. Credence Clearwater Revival’s “<a href="https://youtu.be/ZWijx_AgPiA?si=6IxCHogM0lH6GJ9h">Fortunate Son</a>,” Arlo Guthrie’s “<a href="https://www.openculture.com/2025/11/the-illustrated-version-of-arlo-guthries-alices-restaurant.html">Alice’s Restaurant</a>,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw2L_vGUMtE">Jimi Hendrix’s “Machine Gun”</a>—these songs all took aim at the Johnson and Nixon administrations’ increasingly misguided war effort. But it was Neil Young who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/06/ohio-neil-young-kent-state-shootings">wrote</a> the most damning protest song. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings">the Ohio National Guard shot and killed four students</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings">at Kent State</a> in 1970, Young disappeared for a few hours and returned with the haunting lyrics of “<a href="https://youtu.be/Hi829EsJvVo?si=paycSvvxQRpyusXp">Ohio</a>.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Tin soldiers and Nixon coming,<br>
We’re finally on our own.<br>
This summer I hear the drumming,<br>
Four dead in Ohio.</p>
<p>Gotta get down to it<br>
Soldiers are cutting us down<br>
Should have been done long ago.<br>
What if you knew her<br>
And found her dead on the ground<br>
How can you run when you know?</p></blockquote>
<p>With his new song released this week, Bruce Springsteen picks up this thread. “Streets Of Minneapolis” documents the murder of civilians in Minnesota’s largest city. On January 7, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/ice-agent-who-fatally-shot-woman-in-minneapolis-is-identified/601560214">ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot Renee Good repeatedly in the head</a>, leaving the mother of three dead. On January 24, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000010668660/new-video-analysis-reveals-flawed-and-fatal-decisions-in-shooting-of-pretti.html?smid=url-share">two federal agents fired at least 10 shots at Alex Pretti</a>, killing the ICU nurse instantly. Days later, the identity of these murderers remains hidden—something that news organizations oddly don’t seem troubled by, almost as if we’re quietly accepting that we’re living in a police state. When was the last time American agents could wear masks before killing civilians, and then hide behind a veil of anonymity after? Yeah, that’s normal.</p>
<p>On social media, Springsteen wrote:&nbsp;“I wrote this song on Saturday, recorded it yesterday and released it to you today in response to the state terror being visited on the city of Minneapolis. It’s dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.” You can read the lyrics below.</p>
<p>Through the winter’s ice and cold<br>
Down Nicollet Avenue<br>
A city aflame fought fire and ice<br>
‘Neath an occupier’s boots<br>
King Trump’s private army from the DHS<br>
Guns belted to their coats<br>
Came to Minneapolis to enforce the law<br>
Or so their story goes<br>
Against smoke and rubber bullets<br>
By the dawn’s early light<br>
Citizens stood for justice<br>
Their voices ringing through the night<br>
And there were bloody footprints<br>
Where mercy should have stood<br>
And two dead left to die on snow-filled streets<br>
Alex Pretti and Renee Good</p>
<p>Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice<br>
Singing through the bloody mist<br>
We’ll take our stand for this land<br>
And the stranger in our midst<br>
Here in our home they killed and roamed<br>
In the winter of ’26<br>
We’ll remember the names of those who died<br>
On the streets of Minneapolis</p>
<p>Trump’s federal thugs beat up on<br>
His face and his chest<br>
Then we heard the gunshots<br>
And Alex Pretti lay in the snow, dead<br>
Their claim was self defense, sir<br>
Just don’t believe your eyes<br>
It’s our blood and bones<br>
And these whistles and phones<br>
Against Miller and Noem’s dirty lies</p>
<p>Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice<br>
Crying through the bloody mist<br>
We’ll remember the names of those who died<br>
On the streets of Minneapolis</p>
<p>Now they say they’re here to uphold the law<br>
But they trample on our rights<br>
If your skin is black or brown my friend<br>
You can be questioned or deported on sight</p>
<p>In chants of ICE out now<br>
Our city’s heart and soul persists<br>
Through broken glass and bloody tears<br>
On the streets of Minneapolis</p>
<p>Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice<br>
Singing through the bloody mist<br>
Here in our home they killed and roamed<br>
In the winter of ’26<br>
We’ll take our stand for this land<br>
And the stranger in our midst<br>
We’ll remember the names of those who died<br>
On the streets of Minneapolis<br>
We’ll remember the names of those who died<br>
On the streets of Minneapolis</p>
