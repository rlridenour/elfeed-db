<p>Spring must be on the way, because I seem to be in the mood for spring cleaning. Not the actual &lsquo;get the dusters out and wash the curtains&rsquo; kind, but the digital home spring cleaning version. In my continuing quest to simplify and spruce up things around here, I have made a fresh start with my former photo blog, &lsquo;Wings Open Wide&rsquo;. It is reborn as <a href="https://photos.rousette.org.uk/">wings open wide</a>, hosted on Micro.blog.</p>
<p>I have had the domain <code>wingsopenwide.org.uk</code> for a while, and a photo blog which moved between different backends. Most recently, it was run on <a href="https://blot.im/">Blot</a>, which is a great, and simple to use service for turning a folder of Markdown file, images etc. in your local Dropbox folder into a lovely website. However, after an initial flurry of uploading photos, it just stagnated, and I didn&rsquo;t update it.</p>
<p>Recently, Manton Reece announced new, simplified plans and pricing for <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, the service I already use for my <a href="https://micro.rousette.org.uk">own micro blog</a>. Until recently, I hadn&rsquo;t been making the best use of all the features that Micro.blog provides, and I realised that if I moved up to the Premium plan, I could create a new blog just for photos, and use the various syndication features to send those photos to Mastodon and Flickr etc.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve set it up! I decided against importing all the photos from the old photoblog, and instead I&rsquo;m making a fresh start, with just a few favourites. I will hopefully add more as I go along, as posting them is even easier than with Blot. I might also add a few &lsquo;stories&rsquo; with some text to give context to a bunch of photos, but I&rsquo;ve yet to figure out how best to present that. I will likely still post a few photos on my main Micro.blog account (sewing and knitting projects, keyboards etc.), but most photos will go on the new site and cross-post to Mastodon and Flickr. I have also not posted anything to Flickr recently, so hopefully this might revive my enthusiasm for that site. In due course, I will let my old wings open wide domain lapse, which will also save a bit of money, as well as simplifying things.</p>
<p>Since I seem to be signing up for <em>all the things</em> at the moment, I will also point out that I am now on <a href="https://bsag.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a> to get access to the great social.lol Mastodon server, and a place to gather together my various activities. I have also created a <a href="https://bsag.omg.lol/now">/now page</a>, which I am hoping to update regularly. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
