There are many packages of Emacs that leverage subprocesses to do their jobs, <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot">eglot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy">elpy</a>, to name a few. And there are times that a subprocess doesn&#39;t work as expected, for example, Magit is slow, and you&#39;re sure that it&#39;s ok when running git commands on shell. So how to spot these problems effectively and quickly?</p>

The problem is that we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on exactly, so here I want to share a few Elisp advices to make the subprocess creating visible, and print the exact program and its arguments to the <code class="verbatim">*Message*</code> buffer. Visibility is the key.</p>
