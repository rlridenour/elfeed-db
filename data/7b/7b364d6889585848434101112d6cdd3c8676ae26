Apple has addressed yield issues with the scratch resistant anti-reflective display layer that it wants to use for some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models, and now it looks like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max might feature the upgraded technology.<br/>

A reliable source that spoke to <em>MacRumors</em> said Apple suppliers have been able to achieve a high enough yield on the anti-reflective glass to support mass production. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max will get the new display technology, but it won't be coming to the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For context, we first heard rumors about the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">anti-reflective display layer</a> in 2024. It's supposedly more scratch resistant than the current Ceramic Shield, so the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models that use it may be able to better hold up to wear and tear.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/28/iphone-17-anti-reflective-coating-canceled/">was having problems</a> with scaling the display coating process, and it seemed like the feature was going to be canceled as a result. Adding the anti-reflective layer was too laborious, and it was slowing down production. The process has since been improved, and the new display is once again a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models have a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating and the Ceramic Shield, but Apple hasn't focused on anti-reflectivity for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; display like it has for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac displays.<br/>

Samsung's latest smartphones feature Gorilla Glass Armor, a technology that cuts down on reflections by up to 75 percent and improves contrast in bright lighting conditions. Apple could introduce similar functionality to keep up with the improvements that Samsung has debuted.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/iphone-17-pro-anti-reflective-display/">iPhone 17 Pro Might Get Scratch Resistant Anti-Reflective Display After All</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-might-get-scratch-resistant-anti-reflective-display-after-all.2461668/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
