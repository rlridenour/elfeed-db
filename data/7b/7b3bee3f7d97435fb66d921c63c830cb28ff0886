Today (Saturday) appears to be a slow day on the technical Internet or perhaps everyone is hiding out from the AI apocalypse. Whatever the reason, I can&rsquo;t find anything to write about that&rsquo;s up to the refined standards of Irreal readers.

I offer, therefore, this short post on a niche problem that most of you probably don&rsquo;t have but that may be useful to those that do. If you&rsquo;re an Eshell user you may or may not know that if you repeatedly try to run a command that doesn&rsquo;t exist, Eshell will ask you if you want to set an alias. Over at the Emacs subreddit, Both_Confidence_4147 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1lkowax/eshell_disable_asking_for_alias/">complains about this</a> and asks how to stop it.
</p>
<p>
Presumably, Eshell thinks you&rsquo;re repeatedly mistyping the command name—as in the old time common error or typing &ldquo;moer&rdquo; for &ldquo;more&rdquo; and similar errors—and is offering you a way to avoid the error going forward. Eshell will ask you for an alias after 3 failed commands but, of course, this is configurable. You can also arrange to disable the prompt completely as explained in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1lkowax/comment/mztkug2/">this comment to Both_Confidence_4147&rsquo;s post</a>.

Again, this is a niche problem unless, of course, you&rsquo;re the own who&rsquo;s experiencing it. If you are, now you know how to fix things.</p>
