<h3 id="productivity-principle-of-the-week-creative-task-avoidance">Productivity Principle of the week: Creative Task Avoidance</h3>
<p>Some brains are prone to devising creative techniques to avoid starting some tasks and projects. The solution is to figure out the next logical step, gather your tools, and take imperfect action now.</p>
<p>You don’t need to colour-code your entire task list before making that phone call.</p>
<p>When you feel yourself making plans and systems and diagrams for doing a thing beyond what is needed to actually get the thing done, it can help to stop and take a step back.</p>
<p>Get out a clean sheet of paper and write down the thing that needs doing. Below that, write the single next step required to make progress on it. Discipline yourself to complete that step before spending any more time planning the rest of it. Repeat.</p>
<p>I am very familiar with creative task-avoidance practices because <a href="https://ellanew.com/2020/08/26/i-was-a-task-management-app-addict" title="wikilink">I’ve lived it over and over for decades</a>. Have I done it again this week (see below)? I don’t think so. I’m enjoying the convenience of my new dashboard and calendar category pages while still making progress on important tasks.</p>
<h3 id="time-and-task-management-dashboard">Time and Task Management Dashboard</h3>
<p>This week I created a dashboard for my todo.txt tasks in Obsidian. It gives me a single view of what needs doing, when, organised by the main areas of my life. A dashboard is convenient, but it’s not a must. I can manage my tasks just fine without it.</p>
<p>My dashboard is simply a collection of saved searches, embedded as queries under Markdown headers.</p>
<p>Under the heading of the Dashboard (and every main file in my time and task management system) is an embedded file containing links to frequently accessed pages.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/2b72d180-2ce1-4cbc-88d4-c02971134cc4.png" alt="A header with a group of icons and text links arranged horizontally, below it, and time sector and tag links below that." width="1096" height="796"></p>
<p>Next come the time sectors, with tasks listed under their respective calendar categories. Those links lead directly to that section of the file.</p>
<ul>
<li>@wt Waiting</li>
<li>@td Today</li>
<li>@tw This Week</li>
<li>@nw Next Week</li>
<li>@tm This Month</li>
<li>@nm Next Month</li>
<li>@ty This Year</li>
<li>@ny Next Year</li>
<li>@ib Idea Box</li>
</ul>
<p>Calendar categories are the broad areas of responsibility I use for time blocking. Each week I set aside time to tackle tasks in each of these areas, and the task dashboard tells me what needs to be done.</p>
<ul>
<li>+WK Work</li>
<li>+WR Writing</li>
<li>+EM Personal</li>
<li>+FA Family (people)</li>
<li>+HH Household (things)</li>
<li>+FI Finances</li>
<li>+SV Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Every task has a calendar category assigned to it; some tasks fit into more than one. Each calendar category also has its own page with links to projects and reference information related to that topic.</p>
<p>The queries that generate the search results follow this pattern:</p>
<p>```query<br>
path:todo-txt line:(@tw +WK)<br>
```</p>
<p>That query lists all the Work tasks that need to be done this week. Tasks with specific deadlines go on the calendar. The query below shows Work tasks that need to be done this month, minus any that are also Writing tasks.</p>
<p>```query<br>
path:todo-txt line:(@tm +WK -+WR)<br>
```</p>
<hr>
<p>I have never felt as comfortable with planning my time and my tasks as I do now, with simple lists plus search queries. Dashboards are the icing on the cake. Prediction: I’ll still be happily using this system one year from now. Let’s see if I’m right!</p>

<p>Dear <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/01/inktober-index">Inktober</a>, thank you for the fun! It was good. I didn’t complete the prompts in October, and that’s okay. It was never a stick to beat myself with, after all.</p>
