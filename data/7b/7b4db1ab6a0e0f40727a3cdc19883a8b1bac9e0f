<p>President Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro held what both sides described as a cordial phone call, after a period of sharp tensions that included President Trump publicly floating the idea of military action against Colombia. Trump said the leaders discussed drugs and “other disagreements,” and he announced that arrangements were being made for Petro to visit the White House in the near future. Colombian officials signaled the call could ease strains and strengthen cooperation on drug trafficking, framing the outreach as a chance to reset day-to-day coordination. The call comes amid wider regional friction after a US operation in Venezuela that Petro condemned as a violation of sovereignty, a dispute that had helped drive the latest escalation in rhetoric.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/UfX8sz5q7JM6E6AJsr0vd4_hZhm1gAA2FrAmcvPBP9egKH1J_jcZiPoAfJxhr3WDDumwxB4mHmwHWUEINl_1SifnID7c6ZPQzTgH6DQ1_ZAbwyYjvLyx3lnDvDNLOwXQ-QjVAW27zPMUcRGn9Mjpbw7S8z9p2hE_tfYiQYO2R4JH62toeXA3XJQNinjfmoiV6SWyFVAyOCFUqWPc7c8p0gjrVa0hWYgFv9-IORRntgpWmx4SPzM2ztuH1qd9iIoVyuU16AWC94spac0kHw' alt='People sing the Colombian national anthem during nationwide demonstrations in Cúcuta, Colombia on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Street mobilization: Thousands demonstrated in Colombia as Petro’s government leaned into a message of sovereignty, fueling visible anti-American sentiment even while diplomatic contacts resumed.</li><li>‘First’ conversation: Petro told supporters it was his first direct conversation with Trump since Petro took office in 2022, and he urged reestablishing direct channels between presidents and foreign ministers.</li><li>Dispute specifics: Trump said Petro called to explain “the situation of drugs,” after Trump had accused Petro of “making cocaine and selling it to the United States,” language Colombian officials have rejected.</li><li>Energy pitch: Petro said he raised disagreements over Washington’s approach to Latin America and proposed US investment in clean-energy projects in the region rather than a focus on oil.</li><li>Regional backdrop: Le Monde linked Trump’s earlier threats toward Petro to allegations tied to drug trafficking and to the aftermath of US action that removed Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, which intensified regional tensions.</li></ul><blockquote>It was a Great Honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had. - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House (President Trump): Trump portrayed the call as positive, praising Petro’s “tone” and saying his team was arranging an in-person White House meeting soon after discussions on drugs and other disputes.
