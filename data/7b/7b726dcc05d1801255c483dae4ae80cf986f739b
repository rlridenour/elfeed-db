<p>Back in 2021 a young engineering student named Ken Pillonel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAekbJf4Gsw">modified his own iPhone X</a> to replace the Lightning port with USB-C, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/11/iphone-gets-usb-c-thanks-to-creative-robotics-engineer">which became a small viral sensation</a>. He’s back at it, with a far more ambitious project: iPhone cases with USB-C  ports for the last five or so years of models with Lightning ports. He’s produced three batches of cases so far, but is <a href="https://obsoless.com/products/iph0n3-usb-c-protection-case">currently sold out</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you’re not interested in buying one of these cases, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUXQzVD1TdI">Pillonel’s video documenting how he brought the concept to fruition</a> is quite clever and fun.</p>
