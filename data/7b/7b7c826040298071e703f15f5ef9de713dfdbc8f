         
         <p>In February I announced the plan to reorganise the Denote project into
“core” and “extensions”: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-02-11-emacs-splitting-denote-many-packages/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-02-11-emacs-splitting-denote-many-packages/</a>.
In essence, Denote is a file-naming scheme: you create new files
and/or rename existing ones (of any file type). Having that naming
scheme empowers you to retrieve stuff more easily without the need for
advanced tooling.</p>

<p>Though it turns out we can do a lot of useful things on top of this
simple-yet-powerful idea: custom Dired listings, Org dynamic blocks,
sequence notes, journaling, and many more. Having a clear separation
between core and extensions makes it easier for us to implement all
the features we want without worrying that the main package is
becoming bloated.</p>

<p>Concretely, much of the functionality that was part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code>
package will now be provided by other packages. To this end, I just
made a change to the official elpa.git repository:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>commit f23ff49fb8df22390fe139b432f763860a354175

<h2>Finalising the reorganisation of Denote</h2>

<p>What remains to be done is for me to merge the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reorganise-denote</code>
branch of denote.git into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>. I will do this as soon as the new
packages are indexed on GNU ELPA (maybe later today or tomorrow).</p>

<p>Users of the GNU ELPA package will not be affected immediately. Those
who build from source will, however, have to take action.</p>

<h2>Expect breaking changes</h2>

<p>Users will experience breaking changes when they update to the new
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> package: functionality will be missing. In principle, all
those should be easy to fix: install the appropriate new package and
rename the functions/variables in your configuration accordingly. In
detail:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-extras.el</code> becomes the package
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal</code>. In your configuration replace
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-extras</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal</code>.</li>
  <li>The file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras.el</code> (Org dynamic blocks and related)
becomes the package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org</code>. In your configuration replace
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org</code>.</li>
  <li>The file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-silo-extras.el</code> becomes the package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-silo</code>.
In your configuration replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-silo-extras</code> with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-silo</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the files that were in development but never made it as
part of a formal release, namely, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-md-extras.el</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence.el</code>, will debut as their own packages:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-markdown</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code>, respectively.</p>

<h2>You are welcome to ask me any questions</h2>

<p>I am reluctant to introduce breaking changes, though this has to be
done for the long-term wellness of the project. If you have any
questions, please contact me directly or open an issue on the GitHub
repository. I am happy to help you.</p>

<h2>A concerted release cadence</h2>

<p>All new packages are marked as version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.0.0</code>, which means that only
those who track GNU-devel ELPA (or build from source) will notice
them. The formal release will coincide with the new version of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4.0.0</code>), which I expect to publish some time in April or
May 2025.</p>
