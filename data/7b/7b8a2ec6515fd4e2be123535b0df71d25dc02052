<p>Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been targeted with threats by inmates at Paris’s La Santé prison after he began serving a five‑year sentence, according to video footage that circulated online and multiple news accounts [rt.com#1][firstpost.com#1][straitstimes.com#1]. Prosecutors have opened a formal inquiry after the footage surfaced showing a prisoner confronting the ex‑president inside the facility [france24.com#1][straitstimes.com#1]. The sentence follows a conviction for criminal conspiracy linked to alleged Libyan campaign funding and comes amid wider public scrutiny of his role in the 2011 NATO‑backed operation against Muammar Gaddafi [rt.com#1][straitstimes.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7VclWSKgQveHFaGh-kgi1xo7GYGdonevFSsqsDfbEqonkPGEFv8-smxP5405sye0CjcjePLs2NduzNktM_28eJZch-PjgIFwRcAVB9k7lpa5OiTDkx4922kqQWDKdGey6poZ6dQU8drwp1tdi4mr2efxYXPCXKMWLt7fJy0sjUhZGwmj8mhs4SPaL_Js6ICO8ROxp_HndJGQaX4mt0QLs1xaCIJ2' alt='Former president Nicolas Sarkozy arriving at La Santé prison in Paris, on October 21, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Protection deployed: French interior minister Laurent Nuñez said two officers from the security detail assigned to former presidents will be permanently stationed in cells adjacent to Sarkozy while he is detained [rt.com#1][lemonde.fr#1].</li><li>Solitary placement: Reports say Sarkozy has been placed in the prison’s solitary‑confinement wing after his arrival at La Santé, restricting his contact with other inmates [rt.com#1].</li><li>Video origin: A filmed confrontation was posted on social media and shared widely, with the clip attributed in reporting to a user handle that amplified the footage online [rt.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>We will avenge Gaddafi!
