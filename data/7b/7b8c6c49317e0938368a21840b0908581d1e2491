<blockquote><p>
I must go back to my charming occupation of hearing students give lessons. Here is my programme for this afternoon: Avalanches &#8212; The Steam Engine &#8212; The Thames &#8212; India Rubber &#8212; Bricks &#8212; The Battle of Poictiers &#8212; Subtraction &#8212; The Reindeer &#8212; The Gunpowder Plot &#8212; The Jordan. Alluring, is it not? Twenty minutes each, and the days of one&#8217;s life are only threescore years and ten.
