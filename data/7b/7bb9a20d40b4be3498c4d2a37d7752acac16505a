The Clarity 6K Touch with Fold Stand has a 32-inch 6K display with a touchscreen. The display has a 6016 x 3384 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, 400 nits maximum brightness, and 99 percent Adobe RGB/DCI-P3 color accuracy. The display provides 90W of power for charging up a connected MacBook.<br/>
<br/>
With touch integration enabled through a Mac driver and accompanying app, the Clarity 6K Touch can function like a 32-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. It supports 10-point multitouch and has full MPP 2.0 stylus compatibility, so it supports drawing and sketching along with a number of gestures. Alogic says that it has the same intuitive multitouch functionality as its other Clarity Touch monitors, just with a higher resolution.

The included Clarity Fold Stand allows the display to shift between upright mode and flat drafting table mode, so it functions with any workflow.<br/>
<br/>
Alogic plans to launch the Clarity 6K Touch in mid-October, and it will be priced at &#36;2,000 in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the Clarity 6K Touch, Alogic is also announcing several other displays, including a &#36;1,800 4K 32-inch Aspekt UHD 4K Touch with multiple stand options, a &#36;1,300 non-touch Aspekt UHD 4K, and a &#36;1,500 Edge 5K display with optional Edge Dual Vertical Monitor Mount.<br/>
