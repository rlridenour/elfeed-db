The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a> use an Acoustic Seal Test to check the fit of ear tips, according to a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/119849">Apple support document</a>. Apple says that the Acoustic Seal Test will ensure that you're using the proper ear tip size for the best sound quality and noise cancellation.<br/>

The AirPods Pro 1 and the AirPods Pro 2 have an Ear Tip Fit Test, but Apple updated the process for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;. Apple suggests starting with the medium size ear tip. If you can't achieve a good seal, switch to the larger tip. If the ear tip feels too large, switch to a smaller tip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple designed new foam-infused silicone ear tips for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;, which it says are softer and less stiff than the AirPods Pro 2 ear tips. &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; ear tips come in five sizes, including XXS, XS, S, M, and L. XXS is new for this generation.<br/>
<br/>
For heart rate sensing, the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; need skin contact. Apple warns that the best ear tip size for heart rate sensor accuracy could differ from the best size for acoustic seal. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; should be positioned toward your face at a 45-degree angle, with the heart rate sensor resting against the ear.<br/>
<br/>
If heart rate recordings seem inconsistent, Apple recommends trying a different ear tip size.<br/>

The Acoustic Seal Test can be initiated by connecting the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a>, going to the AirPods Settings, and selecting the Acoustic Seal Test option.<br/>
