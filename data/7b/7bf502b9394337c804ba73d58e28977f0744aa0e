<p>Readers of AppleVis have <a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/apple-vision-accessibility-2024-applevis-report-card">had their say again this year</a>, offering opinions on how well Apple’s accessibility tools serve blind and visually impaired users. The survey is modeled on <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/apple-in-2024-the-six-colors-report-card/">the Six Colors Report Card</a>, but draws from site users, instead of writers and podcasters:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  AppleVis conducted <a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/closed-share-your-apple-vision-accessibility-experience-opinions-2024-applevis-report-card">a comprehensive survey</a> where blind, DeafBlind, and low vision participants rated their experience using Apple’s major platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS) with the available vision accessibility features included in the software.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the third year of the survey, which launched in 2023. Respondents this year gave highest praise to iOS and iPadOS, with lower marks for macOS, watchOS and tvOS than in past surveys.</p>
