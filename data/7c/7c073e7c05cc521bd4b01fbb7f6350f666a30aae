In the U.S., new and qualified returning customers can subscribe to Apple TV+ for just &#36;2.99 per month, for three months. Afterwards, regular pricing of &#36;9.99 per month applies. The offer is available in the Apple TV app, and at <a href="http://tv.apple.com/">tv.apple.com</a>, through April 24. Unfortunately, existing subscribers are not eligible to receive the discount.<br/>
<br/>
The promotion is running in other countries, too. In Canada, for example, the special price is set at &#36;3.99 per month. In the U.K., it is set at £2.99.<br/>

With an Apple TV+ subscription, you can watch all of Apple's original shows and films. You can also watch select MLB and MLS games with weekly Friday Night Baseball and Sunday Night Soccer doubleheaders, at no additional cost.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/18/apple-tv-plus-lower-price-offer/">Apple TV+ Available at Significantly Lower Price Until Next Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-available-at-significantly-lower-price-until-next-week.2455592/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
