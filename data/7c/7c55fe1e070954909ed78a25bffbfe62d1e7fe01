It was initially reported that iPhone 18 Pro models would have fully under-screen Face ID, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/">only a front camera visible in the top-left corner of the screen</a>. However, the latest rumors indicate that the devices will have only partially under-screen Face ID, which will result in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/23/iphone-18-pro-alleged-dynamic-island-size/">narrower Dynamic Island area</a>.<br/>
