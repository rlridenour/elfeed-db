<p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff and presidential adviser Jared Kushner are holding a third meeting in two weeks with Ukraine’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov in Florida, following a five‑hour session with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as Washington promotes an American plan to end the war in Ukraine. President Trump has meanwhile eased some economic pressure on Moscow by suspending certain sanctions affecting Lukoil‑branded gas stations outside Russia until at least late April, while keeping restrictions that aim to prevent profits being repatriated to Russia. Ukrainian officials say they welcome efforts toward peace but insist they will not accept a deal that rewards Russia with Ukrainian territory, calling for “real peace, not appeasement” as Russian forces continue to gain ground in the east. At the same time, EU leaders, led by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, are racing to persuade Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever to back an unprecedented plan to use frozen Russian assets as collateral for a major loan package to keep Ukraine’s government funded.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/UhxfZezczZWbcF2E_Kpqxdd-7we8wALvmNYDhvyqbBXR4jIobBigzv_CQB5TnTnJtTtlLUZPfPr8WdUdnyry-col_EwYr-VuNya-92tMBUxS' alt='Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attends a meeting in Kyiv as international talks over ending the war and securing funding intensify.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>US sanctions shift: The US Treasury has partly suspended Trump‑era measures on Lukoil‑branded filling stations abroad, a move that reduces immediate commercial pressure while preserving a ban designed to stop profits flowing back into Russia’s economy.</li><li>Putin’s public stance: After meeting Witkoff and Kushner, Vladimir Putin praised President Trump’s mediation as a “complex task” but showed no sign of conceding on territory while Russian forces slowly extend control in eastern Ukraine.</li><li>Kyiv’s red lines: Ukraine’s leadership stresses it will consider compromises but rejects any settlement that freezes Russian control over occupied regions, arguing that such an outcome would repeat pre‑World War II patterns of territorial concessions to aggressors.</li><li>EU assets proposal: The EU scheme would leverage hundreds of billions in frozen Russian central bank reserves as security for long‑term loans to Ukraine, with Merz emerging as a key advocate of using these funds as a form of war reparations.</li><li>Belgian reservations: Belgian officials, whose country hosts many of the frozen Russian assets, have raised legal and financial concerns about setting a precedent for seizing sovereign reserves, prompting emergency talks in Brussels to salvage the plan.</li></ul><blockquote>Ukraine wants &quot;real peace, not appeasement&quot; with Russia - Andrii Sybiha</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump’s envoys: Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are presenting an American plan in repeated direct talks with both Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, with Trump describing their hours‑long Moscow meeting with Putin as “reasonably good” while pushing to maintain diplomatic momentum.
