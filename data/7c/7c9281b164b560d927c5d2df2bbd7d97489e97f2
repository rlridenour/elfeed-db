<p>A Hong Kong court sentenced Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily and a prominent pro-democracy figure, to 20 years in prison on Monday after convicting him under a Beijing-imposed national security law. Judges said they set the term after weighing what they called the seriousness of his conduct, and reporters described the hearing as brief. Lai, 78, has been in custody since 2020. The case has drawn close attention as a test of how Hong Kong applies the national security law to political speech and media work.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ouXeAYfea1M7D5a8YeXiHGaLcJg8i_0fpMgP3v3dsiy0hOnkioArQJ_yIZR875zMHB-c1iV-rvvuZrIJM7AtmTCa_PdkIsyO7b_X07S229Ka_ezyE6ryXmHGFf15uDuffh48fsNZ9vLtNWnXWlKLosgeu_4lSBja3_bMia5lN_UiOGqOj94qwhvUWEwwD-vAjhbyMAJjLKsHDuk3ysw_bzYcAJR2ep31tJMxaJr1TNTQk_TxVwjCyYTlN8q56fzb0Zum6Zmoc8yJgDXz3A' alt='File photo of democracy advocate Jimmy Lai leaving Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal on Feb. 9, 2021.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Sentence structure: Judges said two years of the 20-year term overlap with Lai’s existing sentence, which would leave an additional 18 years to serve, according to the judges’ summary cited in reporting.</li><li>Others sentenced: The same proceeding also sentenced others tied to Apple Daily and pro-democracy activism, including six former Apple Daily executives and two activists; some received terms of more than 10 years.</li><li>Media case shift: The New York Times reported that two Apple Daily editors and an opinion writer each received 10-year sentences, calling it a sharp escalation in media-related prosecutions in Hong Kong.</li><li>Press freedom ranking: Semafor, citing CNN reporting, noted Hong Kong’s Reporters Without Borders press-freedom ranking fell from 18th in 2002 to 180th last year, even as the city remains a financial hub.</li><li>Supporters in court: As officers led him away, reporters described Lai waving to people in the public gallery, including his wife, Teresa.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Hong Kong authorities: Authorities said the ruling shows the rule of law at work and highlights the national security system’s deterrent effect, according to BBC reporting.
