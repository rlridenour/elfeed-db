<p>In the latest development, President Trump said Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro will visit the White House next month, signaling a shift toward diplomacy after days of tension between the two leaders. The relationship had appeared at risk after President Trump publicly said military action against Colombia “sounds good,” a remark Petro said fueled fears of potential US action in the region. Both sides later described a phone call as helping ease the immediate crisis and opening a path to talks, even as Petro continued to voice sharp objections to US policies and rhetoric.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/214zjxoUh79wHs6YzB_Uw7_zDqr-wkjvPPFo1Tj_nQaVyz6LtHpnISSivksx7Srr2lf1kh2KND0CQQBb7upcZffb6AReSSOg2u16Q_ez0tF-rY3rmAxXmptsYNpbdE0eL-PB8M6bGhVp1V-UP-iY2KEqxZZACENztrmjrv3_Xay1y9LEjNuiuaAlNShcimGSaHxnjUSajlVOx3cV' alt='President Gustavo Petro of Colombia during an interview with The New York Times in Cartagena on Wednesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tone shift: After their Wednesday call, President Trump posted on Truth Social that speaking with Petro was a “Great Honour,” and a Colombian official said the exchange reflected a “180-degree shift in rhetoric” from both sides.</li><li>Migration crackdown: Petro’s criticism comes as the Trump administration has significantly expanded ICE operations, which the administration describes as a crackdown on crime and immigrants who entered the US illegally.</li><li>Venezuela focus: In interviews, Petro argued for Venezuela to move toward elections through dialogue and a form of “shared government,” while still saying Colombia is cooperating with the United States despite tensions.</li><li>Meeting timing: Multiple outlets reported the White House visit is expected in February, following President Trump’s statement that the meeting would happen in the “near future”.</li><li>White House response: The BBC approached the White House for comment on Petro’s remarks and concerns, according to reporting carried by Dawn.</li></ul><blockquote>I look forward to having a meeting with Gustavo Petro, the President of Colombia, in the White House,... - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Gustavo Petro (Colombia): Petro said there was now a “real threat” of US military action against Colombia after the US raid in Venezuela, accused Washington of acting like an “empire,” and condemned President Trump’s remarks and expanded ICE operations.
