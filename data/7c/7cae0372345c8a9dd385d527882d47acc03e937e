<p>Drawn from the last line of a 1951 poem by Pierre Béarn, the French phrase <em>métro, boulot, dodo</em> describes the monotony of workday life: <em>Métro</em> refers to a subway commute, <em>boulot</em> is an informal word for work, and <em>dodo</em> is baby talk for sleep.</p>
<p>Anna Kaloustian wrote in the <a href="https://yale-herald.com/2023/02/25/metro-boulot-dodo/"><em>Yale Herald</em></a>, &#8220;No English expression manages to quite grasp its prosaic implication, its banality.&#8221;</p>
