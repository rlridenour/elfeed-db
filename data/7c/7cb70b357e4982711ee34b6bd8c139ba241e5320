Spigen recently expanded its C1 series with <a href="https://www.spigen.com/products/apple-watch-classic-c1-charger-stand">an Apple Watch charger</a> that's designed to look like Apple's retro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> G3. For those unfamiliar with Spigen's C1 accessories, they are modeled after classic Apple products.<br/>

The Apple Watch Classic C1 Charger Stand is priced at &#36;34.99, and it is designed to house an Apple Watch charging puck. This is just an Apple Watch charger enclosure, so you're going to need to supply your own puck. The good news is that if you have an Apple Watch with fast charging, you can use the puck that came with it to get the quickest charging speeds.<br/>
<br/>
Spigen's C1 Charger Stand uses the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; G3 shape, with the Apple Watch charging puck embedded in the display. It features a disk drive at the front, and two control buttons. At the back, there's a translucent plastic enclosure with four color options selected to match Apple's original Mac: Tangerine, Graphite, Bondi Blue, and Ruby. Bondi Blue in particular is a well-known color associated with the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; G3.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch charging cable can be pulled through the back of the mini &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, and the cable length can be tucked away under a desk for a cable-free look.<br/>
