<p id="p2">WWDC25 will be held from June 9 - 13 this year and include an in-person experience on June 9 that will provide developers the opportunity to watch the keynote at Apple Park, meet with Apple team members, and take part in special activities. Space will be limited, and details on how to apply to attend can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/special-event/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Developer site</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958/" rel="noopener noreferrer">app</a>.</p>
<p id="p3">Apple has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-the-week-of-june-9/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a>&nbsp;that WWDC 2025 will primarily take place online again this year from June 9-13&nbsp;2025. However, the company said that it simultaneously will hold a corresponding limited in-person event at Apple Park for developers, students, and press like last year.</p>
<p id="p4"><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-the-week-of-june-9/" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a press release</a>&nbsp;issued by today, Susan Prescott, Apple&rsquo;s Vice President of Worldwide Developer Relations and Enterprise and Education Marketing, said:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  We&rsquo;re excited to mark another incredible year of WWDC with our global developer community. We can&rsquo;t wait to share the latest tools and technologies that will empower developers and help them continue to innovate.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">Apple also had <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-the-week-of-june-9/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this to say</a> about events that will be held at Apple Park during the conference:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote7"><p>
  To celebrate the start of WWDC, Apple will also host an in-person experience on June 9 that will provide developers with the opportunity to watch the Keynote and Platforms State of the Union at Apple Park, meet with Apple experts one-on-one and in group labs, and take part in special activities. Space will be limited; details on how to apply to attend can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/" rel="noopener noreferrer">WWDC25 website</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p8">As time passes, fewer of the people I used to count on seeing at WWDC attend. I suppose that&rsquo;s to be expected now that the event is primarily online. However, I&rsquo;m just as excited as ever for this year&rsquo;s event. It&rsquo;s a chance to preview new technology and meet many of the developers whose work we cover. However, with rumors of new hardware on the horizon and a design refresh for all of Apple&rsquo;s OSes, I&rsquo;m sure this year&rsquo;s WWDC will be as interesting as always.</p>
<p id="p9">Of course, MacStories readers can expect the same kind of comprehensive WWDC coverage we do every year. We&rsquo;ll have extensive coverage on MacStories, AppStories, and MacStories Unwind, which will extend to Club MacStories too.</p>
