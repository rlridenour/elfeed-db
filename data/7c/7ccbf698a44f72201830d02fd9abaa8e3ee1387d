<p>Ben Zotto:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Name every pioneering personal computer you can think of from the
1970s. The MITS Altair 8800. The Apple-1. The IMSAI 8080. You may
even know about the SWTPC 6800 or Processor Technology Sol-20.</p>

<p>There’s a computer missing from that list, and it’s an important
one: Sphere Corporation’s Sphere 1. While far ahead of its
competitors in 1975 in what it delivered as an all-in-one PC,
Sphere’s manufacturing operations and cash flow lagged immediately
behind. The company collapsed so quickly that it was nearly erased
from the collective memory of that period.</p>

<p>But I know about Sphere. So does Bill Gates! And it just might
have sparked a few ideas in Steve Wozniak — though not as many as
Sphere’s founder later claimed.</p>

<p>I have a story to tell about this remarkable Utah-based company,
one that fills in the gaps in other histories of the era, and puts
Sphere in the context of the computers we have heard about again
and again for a half century. I want to tell you why Sphere was
important and worth remembering — and explain why they were
forgotten. While first to market with some important technologies,
“firsts” are not as interesting as how their visionary, imperfect
founder could see around corners. His reach far exceeded his
grasp, leading to his early exit and the company’s quick downfall.</p>

<p>I’ll admit that before I encountered this Kickstarter campaign (<a href="https://zeppelin.flights/@glennf/115380107936716029">via Glenn Fleishman</a>, who edited the book), I can’t recall ever even hearing about Sphere. Count me in as a backer.</p>
