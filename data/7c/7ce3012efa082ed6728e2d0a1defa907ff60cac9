<p>When James Cameron was serving as second unit director on <em>Galaxy of Terror</em> (1981), he was asked to film an insert of a severed arm that&#8217;s being eaten by maggots. The team made a fake arm, covered it with mealworms, lit the shot, and rolled the camera, but the mealworms didn&#8217;t move. &#8220;They looked completely inert,&#8221; Cameron said. &#8220;So I thought, well, what would happen if we put a little electrical current through these worms? Maybe they&#8217;d jump around a little more.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we get all ready to do the shot and two guys I knew who were producers had come up behind me to watch me work because they had heard I was doing some directing. I rolled the camera and when I said &#8216;Action,&#8217; what they saw was two hundred mealworms all come to life. When I said &#8216;Cut,&#8217; they stopped moving.</p>
<p>&#8220;This must have been tremendously impressive to two low-budget horror-movie producers. I&#8217;m sure they ratcheted up in their mind that if I could get a performance out of worms, I probably could work very well with actors.&#8221; They hired him that day to direct <em>Piranha II</em>.</p>
