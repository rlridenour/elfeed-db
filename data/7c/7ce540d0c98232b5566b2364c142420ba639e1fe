<blockquote>
  <p>MSNBC viewers have seen the last of Steve Kornacki’s big board.</p>

<p>The popular data maven has signed a deal with NBC that will expand
his presence across the network’s news and sports divisions. But
the new contract does not include working for MSNBC, which is
being spun off into a new corporate entity formed by parent
company Comcast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They might as well just switch off the lights and lock the doors at MSNBC.</p>
