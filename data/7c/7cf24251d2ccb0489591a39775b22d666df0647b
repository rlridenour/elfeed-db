In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-23/apple-aapl-explores-turning-watches-into-wearable-ai-devices-with-cameras-m8ll6mvy"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, Gurman said the plastic Apple Watch SE is now in "jeopardy" for two reasons: design and cost issues.<br/>
<br/>
"The design team doesn't like the look, and the operations team is finding it difficult to make the casing materially cheaper than the current aluminum chassis," he said.<br/>

<br/>
An even more affordable Apple Watch SE with a colorful plastic design could have been appealing to parents who are looking to purchase an Apple Watch for their children.<br/>
