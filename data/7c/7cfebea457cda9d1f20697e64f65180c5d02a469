<p>These days his favourite side project is <a href="https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md" target="_blank">Merlin’s Wisdom Project</a>: a collection of the best advice he’s heard and learned from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s only advice for you because it&nbsp;<strong>had</strong>&nbsp;to be advice for me,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—says Merlin.</p>
<p>Some of my favourites (run through my anti-coarse language filter):</p>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever you’re not sure what to say, either say nothing, or ask a question.</li>
<li>Stop correcting people by immediately telling them what they<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><em>should have said</em>.” You are not helping.</li>
<li>Sometimes, a person will confess something embarrassing that obviously makes them feel really dumb and vulnerable. That is&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;the time to say<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>I told you so,” and it is rarely the best moment to offer advice that they never asked for. Just shut…up and listen.</li>
<li>The earlier a kid is around books often (and in&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;way), the earlier and easier their life of reading will go.</li>
<li>Sometimes, people ask you how you’re doing when they’re especially concerned about how&nbsp;<em>they’re</em>&nbsp;doing.</li>
<li>Great listeners ask good questions.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>And what year was that?” and<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Wow, did that feel really weird at the time?” and<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Yikes, was that as terrible as it sounds?” are the sorts of things humans ask one another when they’re actively listening to what someone is saying.</li>
<li>Whenever you meet someone new, ask them what they’re most excited about right now. Everyone interesting is excited about something right now, and they’d probably love to tell you about it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If an item is especially precious or valuable to you, never set it down anyplace that you wouldn’t want it to be overnight.</li>
<li>If you don’t remember what an app does, you can probably delete it.</li>
<li>Whenever you need to carry two seemingly identical things (like, drinks or toothbrushes or what have you), always—<em>and only</em>—ever carry the one that’s yours in your right hand. When you pick up the two items, always mutter aloud to yourself,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><em>I’m always&nbsp;<strong>right</strong></em>.” Because, now, you are always right.</li>
<li>Buy supplies before you need them and gadgets&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;you need them.</li>
<li>Three is two, two is one, and one is none.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Archive any email that’s older than 30 days. If it kills you to archive a given email,&nbsp;<em>immediately</em>&nbsp;turn it into a task, and then archive it.</li>
<li>Every project is a triangle made of time, money, and quality; shortening the length of one side necessarily lengthens one or—more often—<em>both</em>&nbsp;of the other sides.</li>
<li>Your calendar represents a portfolio of promises to your future self. Treat it that way.
<ul>
<li>Thus: The only events allowed on a serious person’s calendar are commitments about time, location, and effort that will die if they are not successfully completed on a specific day. Full stop.</li>
<li>Corollary: If you’re only tentatively committed to a calendar item—especially if the time of the event has not been mutually confirmed—title the event using Spanish-language questions marks. A future event like<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><code>¿Pick apples with Aunt Sue?</code><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> successfully blocks out the time while also affording a quickly scannable reminder about events that still need to either be formalized or deleted.</li>
</ul></li>
