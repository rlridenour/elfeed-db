<p>US immigration authorities are moving to deport a five-year-old Ecuadorian boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, after he was detained in Minnesota. The case drew public attention when photos showed him wearing a bunny hat and backpack. Multiple reports say Liam and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, entered the United States legally as asylum applicants, but authorities later took them into custody and transferred them to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Dilley, Texas. A judge ordered their release on January 31, but coverage says the US government has continued to pursue removal efforts. Liam’s lawyers have questioned why deportation is being pursued while an asylum case is still pending, and they have suggested the push could be retaliatory; US officials quoted in reports reject that claim. The episode has renewed debate over how the US handles immigration cases involving very young children, while also highlighting that courts can step in on detention decisions even as cases move forward.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/g8yM7TIaUNgmk1nE2wivmI8BOavCcpm-3hdq4aSwdBOSsPIRacsHF9p8HTsoPeDBePD6pZgz-QJGryrU0ZqSZcqIgJKbG6s--VemhPGBSSXDmqTCy2dP60c5f43V762gtnma1PTyqPVeahaWLYJ3CDQ_ECxjIf0HSzqRQjL7h34EEgeDzRiGwJl0ohCXTpyISuUWsdVbRGaMLXJvB1L4khVZMA4Ed-n-qd6yfuVbXGj6eZCncdUJHBta6LqXAqXuVABG' alt='A photo used in coverage of the detention of 5-year-old Ecuadorian asylum seeker Liam Conejo Ramos in Minnesota.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Public attention: The case drew notice after Liam was photographed in Minnesota wearing a bunny hat and backpack.</li><li>Legal status: Multiple reports say Liam and his father entered the United States legally as asylum applicants.</li><li>Post-detention posture: Reports say the government kept pursuing removal even after a court ordered the pair released.</li><li>Conditions claim: One outlet (WSWS) described the south Texas facility as “measles-ridden” as part of its critique of detention conditions; other cited reports do not confirm that characterization.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US officials (as reported by Al Jazeera): The government rejected suggestions that its deportation push against Liam is retaliatory.
