<p>Today is iPhone review release day. Hooray! Tyler Stalman’s iPhone Camera review was most interesting to me. He’s a fan. It was interesting how much he talked about the improvement to the selfie camera. For typical users, this may be the biggest win. The biggest surpise to me was the quality of the AirPods as a wireless mic for shooting video with your phone.</p>
