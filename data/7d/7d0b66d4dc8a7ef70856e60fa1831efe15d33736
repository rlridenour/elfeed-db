<p>The US Senate voted 51–50 to stop a war powers resolution that would have required President Donald Trump to give Congress advance notice before taking further military action against Venezuela, after Vice President J.D. Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. The result came after an intense White House push to keep Republicans aligned, and it leaves President Trump with wider room to continue what opponents describe as an ongoing campaign of attacks and threats against Venezuela. The episode also showed that even on questions as serious as the use of force, Congress is still actively testing how it wants to exercise oversight—an important, if tense, sign that institutional checks are being debated in public.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/erXaNNHykZ3BubQSw6h_A1WZit-ObaJzxJU-PnRZh3QCmIqOBtTr-1-IwssD_lr3XT7Kl6eg2kNMVYk-z2r2L0spFN0QTxTlGzeIrYsA77zSeGrODKnwsuyBLn_-BwgWdgNbirkXDEGLizh0-WHV1I10qMkMdAar2Iky6TgAAz7tDHJWbdg9bZX3WPRWz77TmmyjaV0IRyWqSZVWjSqEsNBhnwGUh-IYAlsRrGthAnQo1iBpqIYkdKER3AE9ieYzuPPMnm-o7aycgD_qWQ' alt='President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.
