<p>No details on <em>what</em> yet, but a lovely little 9-minute video on <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>Sam Altman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What it means to use technology can change in a profound way. I
hope we can bring some of the delight, wonder and creative spirit
that I first felt using an Apple Computer 30 years ago.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jony Ive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have a growing sense that everything I have learned over the
last 30 years has led me to this moment. While I am both anxious
and excited about the responsibility of the substantial work
ahead, I am so grateful for the opportunity to be part of such an
important collaboration. The values and vision of Sam and the
teams at OpenAI and io are a rare inspiration.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not a fan of the lowercase styling of “io”, but otherwise shoot this into my veins. This industry needs a heavy dose of new ideas for new devices. This is just a vibes teaser, but the vibe is a shot across the bow. It conveys grand ambition, but without pretension. To say I’m keen to get my hands on what they’re making is an understatement.</p>
