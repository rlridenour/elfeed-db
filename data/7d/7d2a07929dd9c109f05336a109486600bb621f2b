<p id="p2">Late yesterday, The Iconfactory released 2.0 updates to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot/id1491071483" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tot for macOS</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tot Pocket for iOS and iPadOS</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-mini/id1644609331" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tot Mini for watchOS</a>. The apps, which The Iconfactory describes as tiny text companions, include a handful of big new features that span all three versions, along with other updates and fixes that are unique to each platform.</p>
<p id="p3">What hasn&rsquo;t changed is Tot&rsquo;s incredible design and reliable performance across all platforms. The app showcases some of The Iconfactory&rsquo;s best app design work, which <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tot-review-collect-and-edit-bits-of-text/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federico described in his review of version 1.0</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  Tot&rsquo;s colored dots serve the dual purpose of being spatial navigation tool and context indicators. You can navigate across documents in the app with a quick swipe, and in doing so on modern iPhones you&rsquo;ll feel a delightful haptic tap; alternatively, you can tap the dots to switch documents. As I mentioned above, each dot carries a color, which becomes the background color of the selected document (vibrancy is also used to let the color shine through the software keyboard &ndash; a nice touch). The palette chosen by The Iconfactory for Tot&rsquo;s seven documents is some of the finest selection of colors I&rsquo;ve seen in a modern iOS app: it looks great in light mode, and it looks amazing in dark mode thanks to its combination of high contrast and translucency.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">The combination of that elegant design with reliable sync across multiple OSes and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/automation-april-processing-tot-dots-with-shortcuts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">thoughtful Shortcuts integration</a> has understandably made the Tot family of apps integral to a lot of MacStories readers&rsquo; workflows. However, if you haven&rsquo;t tried any of the Tot apps before, it&rsquo;s worth checking out <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tot-review-collect-and-edit-bits-of-text/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federico&rsquo;s review of version 1.0</a> for the fundamentals because they haven&rsquo;t changed, and I&rsquo;ll be focusing on what&rsquo;s new.</p>

<p id="p7">My favorite 2.0 feature is that Tot now supports automatic indenting. If you indent a line using the Tab key, the next line will begin at the same indentation level when you hit Return. That makes creating hierarchical lists a lot faster than before. My only quibble with the feature is that if you&rsquo;re making a bulleted list, to indent a line, you can&rsquo;t indent using just the Tab key if the cursor appears anywhere in your line of text. However, you can use &#8984; + ] and &#8984; + ] to do the same thing. Regardless of how indenting is invoked, it&rsquo;s an excellent addition to Tot that I was glad to see included in the update.</p>

<p id="p9">Speaking of bullets, Tot 2.0 also supports customizable smart bullets. From the app&rsquo;s settings, you can choose from different pairs of symbols and emoji, like empty and filled circles or empty and filled stars. To toggle between the symbols in each pair, all you need to do is click or tap on them. If the eight default pairs aren&rsquo;t to your taste, there are a bunch of alternatives you can use instead, such as the snowflake and flame emoji. It&rsquo;s a clever twist on standard checkboxes and radio buttons that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed because it adds some character and color to the app.</p>
<p id="p10">Tot adds eight new text dividers, too. From the classic three dashes used in Markdown to asterisks and more, there&rsquo;s a nice variety of options. Plus, you can easily insert a divider with the keyboard shortcut Control + Minus.</p>

<p id="p12">The Iconfactory has made other platform-specific changes, too:</p>
<ul id="ul13"><li>Settings have been redesigned in the Mac version and include new options, such as floating the Tot window over other windows.</li>
<li>The iOS and iPadOS versions include a menu button that offers access to the app&rsquo;s settings along with a couple of bulk operations like saving, sharing, and exporting notes.</li>
<li>The watch app&rsquo;s design has been refreshed with simplified controls and colorful backgrounds.</li>

<p id="p15">It&rsquo;s great to see the Tot apps reach version 2.0. The three tentpole features &ndash; automatic indenting, custom smart bullets, and text dividers &ndash; are all meaningful improvements that don&rsquo;t compromise the apps&rsquo; simplicity. Those features, along with several quality of life improvements and other bug fixes that you can read about in <a href="https://tot.rocks/history" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tot&rsquo;s version history</a>, add up to an excellent update that should serve users well for a long time.</p>
<p id="p16"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot/id1491071483" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tot</a> is available on the Mac App Store, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tot Pocket</a> is available on the iOS and iPadOS App Store. Each costs $19.99, though existing users can update to Tot Pocket at no extra cost. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-mini/id1644609331" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tot Mini</a>, the Apple Watch app, is available as a separate $1.99 purchase.</p>
