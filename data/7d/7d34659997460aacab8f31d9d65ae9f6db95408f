How do I colorize the chmod privileges string? I am using dired+ and dired-hacks and have the ability to colorize the FILES based on the chmod string, but I want the string itself to have colors. I had this a little bit ago but somehow it went away.
For example, each column in so that the eye can follow the colors down and easily see permission differences within a directory.
