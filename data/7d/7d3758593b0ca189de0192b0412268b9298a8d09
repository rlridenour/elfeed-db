<p>Micah Lee, in a spectacularly detailed post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><p>On Thursday, 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/mike-waltz-accidentally-reveals-obscure-app-the-government-is-using-to-archive-signal-messages/">reported</a> that in the Reuters
<a href="https://www.reutersconnect.com/item/us-national-security-advisor-mike-waltz-attends-a-cabinet-meeting-held-by-president-trump-at-the-white-house-in-washington/dGFnOnJldXRlcnMuY29tLDIwMjU6bmV3c21sX1JDMkg4RUFEOEtGRw%3D%3D">photo</a> showing former National Security Advisor and <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/signal-chat-war-crimes-revealed-yemen-trump-admin">war
criminal</a> Mike Waltz checking his Signal messages under the
table, he was actually using an obscure modified Signal app
called TM SGNL, and not the real and actually secure Signal app.</p></li>
<li><p>On Friday, I wrote <a href="https://micahflee.com/tm-sgnl-the-obscure-unofficial-signal-app-mike-waltz-uses-to-text-with-trump-officials/">an analysis</a> of everything I could find
out about TM SGNL using OSINT, including the fact that it’s
nearly impossible to install without a device enrolled in an MDM
service that’s tied to an Apple Business Manager or a Google
Enterprise account.</p></li>
<li><p>On Saturday, after <a href="https://todon.eu/@ljrk/114444796069542288">discovering</a> that TeleMessage
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250503004419/https://www.telemessage.com/developer/api-libraries/">published</a> the source code for the TM SGNL apps for
Android and iPhone themselves, I <a href="https://micahflee.com/heres-the-source-code-for-the-unofficial-signal-app-used-by-trump-officials/">re-published them</a> on
GitHub with the goal of making them easier to research. (It
looks like the iOS source code is actually just unmodified
Signal, so maybe they actually only published their Android
code.)</p></li>
<li><p>On Saturday night, an anonymous source told me they hacked
TeleMessage.</p></li>
<li><p>On Sunday, I, along with Joseph Cox, <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/">published an article</a>
about the hack to 404 Media (and to <a href="https://micahflee.com/the-signal-clone-the-trump-admin-uses-was-hacked/">my blog</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>On Monday, NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/telemessage-suspends-services-hackers-say-breached-app-rcna204925">reported</a> that TeleMessage suspended
its service after a <em>second hacker</em> breached TeleMessage and
“downloaded a large cache of files.”</p></li>
<li><p>Today, Senator Ron Wyden <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/doj_letter_telemessage.pdf">published</a> a letter, which cites
the 404 Media article and my analysis of TM SGNL, to Attorney
General Pam Bondi, requesting that the Justice Department
investigate the “serious threat to U.S. national security posed
by TeleMessage, a federal contractor that sold dangerously
insecure communications software to the White House and other
federal agencies.”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>National security leaders using this app — which effectively just <em>removes</em> all of Signal’s actual security features by backing up all messages as plain text — is so stupid it’s surprising, even from these idiots Trump has surrounded himself with. I mean think about how stupid it is that Mike Waltz was using this app while in front of press photographers at a Cabinet meeting.</p>

<p>Lee goes deep, including an analysis of TM SGNL’s open source Android source code, to show that it’s designed to transmit backups of messages in plain text to publicly-facing servers. And it turns out those servers had easily-hackable flaws.</p>
