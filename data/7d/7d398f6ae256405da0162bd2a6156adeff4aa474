<p>President Trump told reporters on Air Force One that the U.S. Constitution prevents him from seeking a third presidential term in 2028, saying “I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad,” as he flew from Japan to South Korea on Wednesday, October 29, 2025 . The remark followed repeated public hints by the president that he would &quot;love&quot; another term and comes after House Speaker Mike Johnson said there was no path to a third term; legal observers also note the two-term limit in the 22nd Amendment . Trump qualified his concession by adding he would “see what happens,” leaving room for continued public commentary even while acknowledging the constitutional limit .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/OzCsBznxsSr0m2DEpV58paeg9pjuzNyjCXb3eJcz99gp52WShP-Wr0OFWyyrqBsr9m889n2T-GCgBJ5TYc6avKvlf_PQXIMvuX2x_U6TcuGnFrHUFisJ5YVAc6XeaflXjDoYd-vPodEwzB7rQXI2wN7VvwjU-3z1DSDBj6P2Sha3OCFLP7-4gMM-RcQ-75cVwZKbZLx8LFnU6taYHoFRCjye6vyTVhnl9gsEqvlF1zzDP5H64-bdqViwc7K8UIpCpHnciNBBXz-tE7AvjRM' alt='Coverage image for Trump comments on being barred from a third presidential term' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Speaker response: House Speaker Mike Johnson publicly said there is no legal path to a third term and suggested the president knows the constitutional constrictions .</li><li>Prior signals: In recent months Trump repeatedly teased a third-term idea — at times saying he would “love” to run and displaying &#x27;Trump 2028&#x27; campaign caps — actions noted by reporters and political coverage .</li><li>Where remarks came: The comments were made aboard Air Force One en route from Japan to South Korea during a broader Asia trip that included high-stakes trade and diplomatic engagements .</li><li>Legal consensus: Multiple outlets reported legal scholars and critics point to the 22nd Amendment as a clear bar to serving more than two terms, a point underscored in coverage of the exchange .</li></ul><blockquote>Based on what I read, I guess, I’m not allowed to run.
