<p>Haleluya Hadero and Christopher Rugaber, reporting for the AP back on January 26, six days into Trump 2.0:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok’s parent
company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a
new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok’s U.S. business,
according to a person familiar with the matter. The proposal,
submitted last week, is a revision of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-us-ban-trump-extension-a3936a93f174d176d3633a67554d771b">a prior plan</a> the
artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok’s parent
ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went
into effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They should have added a similar provision to their <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/12/perplexity-jumps-shark-stunt-offer-to-buy-chrome">Chrome offer sheet</a> today. Give 25% to the US Treasury and another 25% to Trump’s future presidential “library”.</p>
