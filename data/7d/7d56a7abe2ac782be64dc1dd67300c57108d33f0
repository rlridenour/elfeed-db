With an ultra-thin design that measures just 5.6mm at its thinnest point, Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-announces-iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> tops the iPhone 6 as the thinnest iPhone ever released.<br/>

With a 6.9mm frame, the iPhone 6 was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/iphone-6-plus-bending-pockets/">prone to bending</a>, although the most egregious examples were often seen <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/23/iphone-6-plus-bend-video/">in YouTube videos</a> that used excessive force.<br/>
<br/>
The big question: Will the iPhone Air bend?<br/>
<br/>
In a video that Apple <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/apples-iphone-durability-test-clips-show-how-it-made-sure-the-iphone-air-and-iphone-17-series-are-built-to-last">provided to <em>Tom's Guide</em></a>, Apple subjected the iPhone Air to a machine that simulated "130 pounds of pressure" on the middle of the device. The publication said the video shows the device "springs back remarkably well and doesn't show any lasting curve from the experience." You can watch it for yourself in their report.<br/>
<br/>
It appears the iPhone Air should be bend-proof in most if not all real-world scenarios, but we still have to wait for independent, third-party tests.<br/>

It does seem pretty safe to say that the iPhone Air will not bend in the same way the iPhone 6 did, and a big reason for that is the device has a titanium frame, whereas the iPhone 6 was made with aluminum. Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-iphone-air-a-powerful-new-iphone-with-a-breakthrough-design/">said</a> the iPhone Air "exceeds" its "stringent bend strength requirements," and touted it as the most durable iPhone ever.<br/>
<br/>
The report also includes a few other durability test videos from Apple, including one that tests the Ceramic Shield 2 front cover on iPhone 17 models, which is promised to offer 3× better scratch resistance compared to the previous generation. Another video subjects the iPhone 17 Pro to simulated drop tests. Unsurprisingly, given these videos are from Apple, the results are favorable. Real-world tests will confirm things soon.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-17">iPhone 17 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-17-Pro">iPhone 17 Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/iphone-air-bend-test/">Will the iPhone Air Bend?
