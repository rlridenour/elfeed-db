</ul><h1>Stay Dry</h1><p>Something like this can seem straightforward enough.</p>
<p>Waterproof bags.</p>
<p>Cool, right?</p>
<p>And yet, it’s often with the most simple of products that we’re bound to overlook something. Thus, in an attempt at utmost thoroughness, we’ve put together a little FAQ to help you better understand what we’re offering today.</p>
<p>Here goes!</p>
<p><em><strong>How many bags are being offered today?</strong></em></p>
<p>Three. Each set includes a 5L, 10L, and 20L bag.</p>
<p><em><strong>And if one of these bags were to fall into a body of water, what would happen to what’s inside them?</strong></em></p>
<p>Nothing. Thanks to its waterproof poly coating and airtight weave, everything inside would remain dry.</p>
<p><em><strong>What if what I put inside was more water?</strong></em></p>
<p>Um… well… then it would be wet inside too, obviously.</p>
<p><em><strong>But the two waters wouldn’t mix, right? The water from inside wouldn’t leech out into the water outside, and the water outside wouldn’t get inside?</strong></em></p>
<p>I guess not? Honestly, it’s hard to imagine what scenario would be require someone to fill a bag with water and then throw it into a body of water and ensure zero transference.</p>
<p><em><strong>What if I told you I’ve developed a new variety of drinking water, one that is exceptionally healthy for humans but will kill any fish that drinks even a micron of it? And what if I needed to transport said water across a river?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’d say, take a boat and hold onto the water sample tight.</p>
<p><em><strong>What if I don’t have a boat?</strong></em></p>
<p>There’s got to be a bridge, right?</p>
<p><em><strong>What if the bridge adds a whole twenty-five minutes to the trip?</strong></em></p>
<p>That seems worth it in this case. But hold on, how did you develop a “new water”?</p>
<p><em><strong>What? How did you know that’s what we decided to call it (spelled NuWater)? Did someone leak NuWater to the press?</strong></em></p>
<p>Maybe. But you know what won’t leak? Water into these bags!</p>
<p>Thus concludes our FAQ.</p>
<p>(Look, sometimes there’s a holiday weekend approaching and you just need to write some words. They can’t all be masterpieces, people.)</p>
