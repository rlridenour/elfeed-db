</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Thankful for a fantastic day with friends, a good game, and a good book.  A day that spilled over into the next.

If we listen closely, amid the din of empires and nations, we might hear the
faint sound of beating wings, the sweet stirrings of life and hope.

<p><time datetime="2025-08-07" title="2025-08-07">Yesterday</time> some friends came over: I played Vantage with one while the others
played with the dogs.</p>
<p>The game of Vantage is unlike any board game I’ve played before; a cooperative
exploration game.  It is closest to a choose your own adventure book and a
hexcrawl.  The game reveals itself to you as you make somewhat informed
decisions which launch you down new pathways.  Instead of attending to the
mission at hand, my character stumbled into a village and became a tavern owner.
I stopped exploring and set about learning skills, serving drinks, and crafting
tools.</p>
<p>After we packed up the game and my guests left, I published another post and
then read more of <cite data-id="1254A3B2-19CC-4EA7-AA80-39B70CD21F5D">The Creative Act</cite> by Rick Rubin, a meditation
on art and self.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-08-07" title="2025-08-07">This morning</time> I woke before even the hint of dawn; 5am.  Darkness would soon to
fade.  I sat to meditate and do some stretches.  Lacey (the more attention needy
of the two) kept trying to nudge my hand to pet her.  I’d tuck my hands away,
and she finally settled on her bed.</p>
<p>I have found that sitting in emptiness comes easy for me.  I sat for 20 minutes,
breathing, and letting myself flow through me.  I switched on a lamp and sat and
resumed reading <cite data-id="1254A3B2-19CC-4EA7-AA80-39B70CD21F5D">The Creative Act</cite>.  That lamp, I felt as though I was stealing
night’s authority.  It is one thing keep a light burning as the day fades, but
another sensation to spark a light before night’s has begun its departure.</p>
<p>After a bit of reading, I rose and took the dogs outside.  By this point, the
sky had grown a bit lighter.  Venus and a companion hung bright as a wedded pair
drawing close.  I did some more stretches, breathing deep, and listening as
birds began waking.  Only now did I hear the noises of vehicles rumbling and
grumbling about the start of their day.</p>
<p>I came back in, read some more, then took the dogs on a short walk.  I felt the
cool yet humid morning, it will be warm and sticky.  After my walk, I fed the
dogs then fried an egg, toasted some bread, and poured some homemade kombucha.
I ate a quiet meal.</p>
<p>Then I sat down committing to finish <cite data-id="1254A3B2-19CC-4EA7-AA80-39B70CD21F5D">The Creative Act</cite>; which I did.  Each
chapter being reflections on life, art, and how to live it.  My pencil scribbled
across pages.  Capturing and connecting with past and current readings, work
conversations, and moments near and far.</p>
<p>I feel <cite data-id="1254A3B2-19CC-4EA7-AA80-39B70CD21F5D">The Creative Act</cite> filling with light the cracks within me; that are me.
I feel the book vibrating and swelling within me, as though I’m afloat in the
Lake Michigan and it is the waves, lifting and pushing me.  In this feeling,
there is no worry of undertow nor sunburn, just that feeling of warm sun
sparkling on my wet skin, cooled by the waters pulled from the depths of
creation.  As though time ceases and the afternoon won’t ever fade.</p>
<p>There is some divine in this book, a gentle and assuring voice, speaking in
paradox and resonance; not through story so much as triangulation.  Of orienting
to oneself, in its multitudes, as well as one’s relationship to their created
art and the processes one might take bringing forward that art.</p>
<p>I see <cite data-id="1254A3B2-19CC-4EA7-AA80-39B70CD21F5D">The Creative Act</cite> being a book I keep within reach.  Its 60 or so short
chapters can be viewed through the lens of a devotional; pluck one at random and
give it a read.  There’s perhaps wisdom within.</p>
<p>I realize now, my personal mistake in that play of Vantage.  I had settled into
a routine.  While my partner was exploring bandit caves, befriending animals,
and climbing inspiring vistas, I settled in and chose to “play adult.”  There
was so much to explore.</p>
<p>Now, I wonder, am I writing about that game or this life I live?</p>
