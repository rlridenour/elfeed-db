<p>President Trump plans to convene the first meeting of his new U.S.-led “Board of Peace” in Washington on Feb. 19, according to officials and multiple outlets. Time reported the agenda will include fundraising for Gaza’s reconstruction and talks on the next phase of a Gaza ceasefire, and that the meeting is expected to take place at the U.S. Institute of Peace. Trump announced the board at the World Economic Forum in Davos. It includes a mix of Middle East partners and other invited countries, while some close U.S. allies have declined to join amid concerns about how it would interact with the United Nations and about reported financial expectations tied to membership. Supporters say the board could be a practical way to mobilize resources and keep rebuilding efforts moving. Skeptics question its structure and whether it could sideline existing multilateral channels.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/N5JxOM9J_rOvdC_UjNlUo-4gT0j7KC-TllQB0bSsMHrWPF_UDoAfenHi3RkzV-cKfXmlzBAh-977gDRsgtvX6WqR2z2tmtDYREqz1hZ2Zt8jhGHSIWOOmWxy_LZSjg-55iiUTpd_ep8dQve3mu5hmj2KVc9sTufJM0FRRZudYkvOWCe3j1eEBbEN-KtMt5mCrNn2N9OY0s1JOYAeFQ_f7RMloV30RxXf-Cl6xfvTEgpfWl0zy9yiR65mrWd2tjK-V5-aUS7Apnjph4AokA' alt='President Donald Trump speaks during a session on his Board of Peace initiative at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 22, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who’s invited: Time listed the initial invitees as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Bahrain, Pakistan, Turkey, Hungary, Morocco, Kosovo, Albania, Bulgaria, Argentina, Paraguay, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Indonesia and Vietnam.</li><li>Funding condition: Time reported that permanent membership is tied to contributing $1 billion in cash within the first year, a requirement that helped drive some allies’ reluctance to join.</li><li>Russia offer: Time reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin said he is open to contributing $1 billion, but argued it would require releasing Russian assets frozen in the U.S. during the Biden administration.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Meeting participation (officials briefed): Reporting said the Feb. 19 session is expected to include world leaders who accepted Trump’s invitation, along with members of an executive committee for Gaza.
