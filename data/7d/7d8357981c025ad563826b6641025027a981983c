Intro I found a one-liner that allowed me to test the outgoing mail setup on a remote server. The following one-liner worked, and introduced me to some new-to-me functionality with Bash and Mail.
mail -s &#34;Testing Not registration confirmation&#34; -r from@address.com to1@example.com,to2@example.com &lt;&lt;&lt; &#39;testing 4&#39; Analysis mail The command assumes that you already have a working Mail1 aka PostFix setup on the server you are running on, which means a sendmail setup.
