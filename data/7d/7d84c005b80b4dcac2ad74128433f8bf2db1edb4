Apple recently <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">updated its online store</a> with a new ordering process for Macs, including the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro.<br/>

There used to be a handful of standard configurations available for each Mac, but now you must configure a Mac entirely from scratch on a feature-by-feature basis. In other words, ordering a new Mac now works much like ordering an iPad.<br/>
<br/>
This change was <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3048329/apple-just-completely-changed-how-you-buy-a-new-mac.html">spotted by <em>Macworld</em></a> and the <a href="https://consomac.fr/news-23003-apple-repense-le-systeme-de-configuration-des-macs-sur-l-apple-store.html">French blog <em>Consomac</em></a>, among <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookpro/comments/1qs6d5p/apple_updated_the_macbook_configurator_possibly/">others</a>.<br/>

On the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro">MacBook Pro ordering page</a>, for example, you start by choosing a 14-inch or 16-inch display and a color. Next, you have the option to upgrade to a nano-texture display. Then, you choose from the list of M-series chips and core counts that are available for the MacBook Pro size that you selected. Finally, you can customize the amount of RAM and SSD storage, choose a power adapter, and choose a keyboard language.<br/>

Before, there were some preconfigured models available, and you could proceed to upgrade certain specs after selecting one. Now, it is entirely à la carte.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the MacBook Pro still cannot be configured with an M5 Pro or M5 Max chip, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/when-is-new-macbook-pro-coming-out/">the wait continues for new models</a>. Hopefully that changes soon!<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/31/apple-changes-how-you-order-a-mac/">Apple Changes How You Order a Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-changes-how-you-order-a-mac.2476968/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
