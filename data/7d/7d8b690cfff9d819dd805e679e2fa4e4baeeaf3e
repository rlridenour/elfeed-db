<p id="p2">You&rsquo;re sure to see a lot of Prime Day roundups around the web today, but ours is a little different. Although there are a lot of great deals during Prime Day, we gather ours from among the hardware we&rsquo;ve actually tried and can recommend to readers. Here are the best deals we&rsquo;ve found.</p>
<p id="p3">For even more deals, <a href="https://club.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">join Club MacStories+ or Premier</a> to become a part of our Discord community, where members are sharing their favorite finds, too.</p>

<p id="p5">I&rsquo;ve tried just about every major brand of microSD card at this point while testing handheld gaming consoles for <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPC: Next Portable Console</a>. One of my go-to brands is Lexar, which has a bunch of cards on sale for Prime Day:</p>
<ul id="ul6"><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1DSP4QW?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">1TB microSD card</a> (26% off)</li>

</ul><p id="p7">Also on sale are Lexar&rsquo;s portable external SSDs, which I most recently used at WWDC for transporting large podcast files. You can get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVNM6H87?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 2TB SL500 model</a>, with USB-C 3.2 data transfer rates, for 31% off during Prime Day.</p>

<p id="p9">If you shoot video with your iPhone, you might want to check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG16HCWB?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexar&rsquo;s 2TB Professional Go SSD</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKKKPM41?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hub</a>, which I used <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/whats-in-my-ces-bag/" rel="noopener noreferrer">to shoot video for NPC during CES</a> in January. On sale for 30% off, the SSD fits right on the end of your iPhone, adding a bunch of extra storage for video footage, and with the hub (also 30% off), you can add an extra port for charging as you shoot videos. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DFZZH6VV?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 1TB version</a> of the SSD is on sale for 26% off, too.</p>

<p id="p14">Earlier this year, I upgraded my Wi-Fi to a TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 Mesh system. I came from a Wi-Fi 6E system and was pleasantly surprised to find that TP-Link&rsquo;s Deco BE95 Wi-Fi 7 BE22000 routers are substantially faster. I&rsquo;ve had the setup for about three months, and I love it. During Prime Day, you can get the routers <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR5C4RZN?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">individually</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4W31L4N?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a three-pack</a> for 30% off.</p>

It&rsquo;s a great deal, and so is the 33% you can save on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6LP1Q1Z?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">a four-pack of the recessed Hue lights</a> that Federico added to his setup today.</p>

<p id="p18">I&rsquo;ve used Logitech keyboards and mice for a long time. For Prime Day, the company is offering its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2FD5994?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keys-to-Go 2 keyboard</a>, the slimmest and most usable small keyboard I&rsquo;ve ever tried, for 25% off. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDFF9QSW?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">The POP Mouse</a>, which I use with a variety of handheld gaming devices and the Mac mini, is also on sale for 37% off. Finally, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXCDPPK?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logitech C922x HD webcam</a> is 37% off.

<p id="p20">Earlier this year, I purchased an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CH3P9K1X?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elgato Prompter</a> that uses mirrors to reflect a second Mac screen in front of a camera for recording videos. It&rsquo;s a clever setup that works not only with Elgato&rsquo;s webcams, but also with DSLRs and even iPhones, which is how I use it. During Prime Day, the Prompter is 33% off.</p>
<p id="p21">Two other handy podcasting tools I use every week are on sale too. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L755X9G?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elgato Key Light</a> is 22% off during Prime Day, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09737ZXMK?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wave Mic Arm</a> is 30% off.</p>
<p id="p22"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPFWXMBL?tag=macstories00-20&amp;linkcode=af3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elgato&rsquo;s 4K capture card</a>, which is compatible with HDMI 2.1, is on sale during Prime Day for 20% off. It&rsquo;s one of the best ways I&rsquo;ve found for capturing videogame footage or anything else that connects via HDMI.</p>
