<p>Sean Lyndersay, general manager of Edge at Microsoft:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For decades, the way we’ve used browsers has remained linear: open
a tab (or 20), search for something, read a page, repeat. It’s a
model that’s worked well, but it hasn’t fundamentally changed.
Until now. As AI begins to reshape nearly every facet of digital
life, we’re witnessing a turning point in how we interact with the
web. Now, it’s worth asking: is your browser working for you as
much as it should?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Color me skeptical about the idea that my web browser should be “working for me”, rather than serving as a tool for me to work with. The AI hype cycle is pointing to a future where automated agentic web browsers surf automated AI-generated websites. Robots consuming robot-generated content — an infinite loop of AI onanism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is why today we’re excited to launch Copilot Mode, a new
experimental mode in Microsoft Edge, and our next step towards
building a more powerful way to pilot the web.</p>

<p>With Copilot Mode on, you enable innovative AI features in Edge
that enhance your browser. It doesn’t just wait idly for you to
click but anticipates what you might want to do next. It doesn’t
just give you endless tabs to sift through but works with you as a
collaborator that makes sense of it all. It keeps you browsing,
cuts through clutter and removes friction to unlock your flow — all built to the highest Microsoft standards of security, privacy
and performance trusted by billions of people and businesses
worldwide — with you as the user always in control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft is famously known for presenting interfaces that “cut through clutter” and “remove friction”. I’m sure this will be great.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the decade-ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/29/hbo-netflix">Netflix strategy espoused by Ted Sarandos</a>: “The goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.” I think something similar is behind Microsoft trying to make Copilot front-and-center in Edge, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/29/chrome-ai-shopping">Google’s concurrent move to junk up Chrome</a> with AI-generated suggestions. Their goal is to make their web browsers chatbots faster than OpenAI can make ChatGPT a web browser.</p>

<p>HBO is still around. It even just <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/14/hbo-max-again">got its name back</a>. But Netflix won that race.</p>
