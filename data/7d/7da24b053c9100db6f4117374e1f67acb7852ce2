<p>I wrote an email to System76 support describing the latest issue (I took out the person&rsquo;s actual name)</p>

<p>Good morning agent12,</p>
<p>I believe I identified the issue - Nvidia drivers installed from the Pop OS store (and not with apt).</p>
<p>Over the weekend, I wiped my system clean and started with a fresh install of Pop OS. When I updated the nvidia drivers from the command line using the instructions you provided earlier (including the purge)<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, the system installed the driver (570.153.02) without an issue. I was able to restart the system and log in. I installed a couple of programs and then it occurred to me to try the Pop OS store driver, which has a slightly more advanced version (575.57.08):</p>

<p>After the driver started installing, the screen turned off and the system froze in the same manner it did before<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. I attempted to purge and install again from the terminal, but it froze again - so, I was back where I was before. I wiped my system clean again, started with a clean Pop OS, and was able to upgrade the drivers from the terminal once more. This time I&rsquo;m not trying to download and install drivers from the store.</p>
<p>When I looked up the Nvidia drivers for linux on their site, I wasn&rsquo;t able to find the version in the Pop OS store anyway, though Nvidia&rsquo;s site does have more advanced drivers - and they come with the recommendation not to install those and stick to the distro&rsquo;s version.</p>
<p>Given that the games I play on Steam seem to be happy with these drivers that come with apt, I think I will stick to those for now. Hopefully I won&rsquo;t' encounter random freezes again.</p>
<p>Do you have an idea why the Pop OS drivers won&rsquo;t work? The store is convenient, especially with the integration of flatpacks, but I don&rsquo;t mind using the command line.</p>

<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p><sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> : The insturciton I was given are pruging nvidia drivers from the system, and then reinstalling them with system76&rsquo;s repo:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt purge ~nvidia
sudo apt clean
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --reinstall system76-driver-nvidia
sudo systemctl reboot
</code></pre>
<p><sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> : My issue was that during the driver upgrade, the screen would turn off and the system would stop responding. It&rsquo;s normal to have the screen turn off for a few seconds when you install a new GPU driver (at least on Windows), but I did leave my system on overnight at one point, and it still was at the same state the next morning. The keyboard did not respond either. I had to restart, which damaged the upgrade process, which I then had to fix with <code>sudo dpkg --configure -a</code> from a rescue shell because I couldn&rsquo;t load the Gnome environment. After the above command and a restart, the upgrade seemed to have gone through, but then there was the other issue: the desktop fan would suddenly start blasting, and the screen would turn off in the same manner I just mentioned. This would usually happen when I would play something that requires more GPU juice, like a game.</p>
