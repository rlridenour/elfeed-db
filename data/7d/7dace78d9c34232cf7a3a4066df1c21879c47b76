<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/jpmorgan-chase-nears-a-deal-to-take-over-apples-credit-card-program-0bbcdda8">Wall Street Journal reports</a>&nbsp;that Apple and Chase are about to make a deal to move the Apple Card to Chase. It’ll be interesting how the the transition is managed.</p>



<p>Some reporting says there is a high default rate with the existing Apple Card customers. I wonder if Chase will make everyone re-apply.</p>
