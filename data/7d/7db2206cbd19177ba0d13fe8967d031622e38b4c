Apple is going to unveil <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a> in just about two months at its June WWDC event, and rumors suggest that it's going to bring a big change to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s design. It's been described as the most notable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">design overhaul since iOS 7</a>, so it should be an exciting update.<br/>

We've rounded up everything we've heard so far about the design changes coming to &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>visionOS-like design with translucency</strong> - &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; is inspired by visionOS, which has an emphasis on translucency and UI elements that kind of fade into the background to put the focus on content. &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; could lean heavily into that translucency, with Apple also opting for a floating look for navigation bars, windows, and other parts of the UI.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>A glassier look</strong> - Remember the Aqua Mac interface? &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; has been described as having glass effects or as being glossy, with menu elements that can "reflect" light based on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; tilt.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Subtle lighting effects</strong> - The "glassy" look involves subtle lighting changes, such as a slight glint for some UI elements when you move the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The Flashlight and Camera controls on the Lock Screen reportedly have a glass-like sheen that shimmers with movement, for example.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>More rounded, expanding buttons</strong> - Along with a soft, floating look, navigation bars and buttons could have more rounded edges that blend better with the content behind them. In the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app, for example, photos could be full screen with controls in a slimmed down menu bar at the bottom rather than a full navigation strip. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/haptic-touch-vs-3d-touch-whats-the-difference/">Haptic Touch</a> menus, Control Center options, and permission prompts apparently have more rounded corners, too.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Pill-shaped tab bars</strong> - Many apps like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, Phone, and more have been described as having pill-shaped tab bars at the bottom for accessing controls. There's also less transitioning. Search, for example, doesn't have its own dedicated interface, and instead expands out from the tab bar.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Round app icons, maybe</strong> - Leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a> says that Apple is going to make the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s icons rounder, though he is unclear if they will be entirely circular or some kind of cross between a circle and the current squircle.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Simplified navigation and controls</strong> - Apple wants to make it easier to navigate through apps, System settings, and more, so expect a more streamlined experience.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Cross-platform cohesiveness</strong> - These design changes aren't just coming to iOS - iPadOS and macOS will also get the same overhauled look, so it will be less jarring going from a Mac to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and vice versa.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
