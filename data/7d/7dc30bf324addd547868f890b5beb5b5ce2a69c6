I can use C-h m to check the bindings of my current major mode, if it&rsquo;s one where I can rest my cursor. But how can I check the bindings that are present in, eg, isearch mode? I can set up such bindings, but I&rsquo;m not sure how to review them.
Answer: describe-keymap In emacs 28 there seems to be created the perfect function for this: (describe-keymap)1
