Apple today introduced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Air, and it is the thinnest and lightest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date. With a 5.6mm thick chassis, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air doesn't have as much internal space as other iPhones for a battery.<br/>

There have been rumors suggesting the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air would have worse battery life than the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models, but there were also rumors indicating that Apple had workarounds, like denser battery technology.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air's battery will last for up to 27 hours when watching videos and up to 22 hours when streaming videos. <br/>
<br/>
It has the lowest battery life of the four &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models, but Apple is using high-density battery technology to improve battery life. Apple did not provide information on the watt-hours of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air battery, but information published on Apple's European site indicates that it has a 3,149 mAh battery inside. 3,149 mAh is most comparable to the 3,227 mAh battery that was in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13. <br/>
<br/>
For comparison, the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; has a 3,692 mAh battery, the 17 Pro has a 4,252 mAh battery, and the 17 Pro Max has a 5,088 mAh battery.<br/>

Apple introduced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> battery pack to go along with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air, plus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> has an Adaptive Power mode that's meant to extend battery life when &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; activity is above a normal day-to-day baseline.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-air-battery/">iPhone Air Battery: What You&#039;re Trading for the Thinnest iPhone Ever</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-battery-what-youre-trading-for-the-thinnest-iphone-ever.2465073/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
