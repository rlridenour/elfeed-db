<p>Britain’s former Prince Andrew has moved out of Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate and is now staying at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, according to multiple reports and confirmation from a royal source. Several outlets said the move came sooner than previously expected, as fresh scrutiny followed recent releases of documents from the U.S. investigation linked to Jeffrey Epstein. The shift highlights the ongoing pressure on the royal family over the reputational fallout from Andrew’s past association with Epstein—an issue back in the spotlight as more documents become public. On a practical level, reports say his Sandringham accommodation is temporary, and he is expected to return to Royal Lodge in the coming weeks to collect remaining belongings.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/E1TpLezrJNzPNyeT2LryPes1V21BGMLBDWs3WXEU4ijzpAswd64g6NTtM6CoVgczudNn_k1QQUECR938L-7K7X2mn4PoXvivl1G9NQrmNpcZq1MRddb7y-GHRPUulMmtXK0sqyun4vptbIfY73bjQWIuTChZdtiFX5AXu3l4qQ' alt='Prince Andrew pictured amid reporting on his move from Royal Lodge to the Sandringham estate.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Temporary or permanent?
