<p>It&rsquo;s been a good ol&rsquo; run down at Coney St. but all things must come to an end. If you&rsquo;ve not caught the show yet this is the final weekend coming up. This Saturday 14th from 10-5pm grab yourself a unique piece of original art, postcard, print or zine at a kind of impromptu Art Market in the space.
