  <p>A group of bipartisan U.S. lawmakers are urging the head of the
U.K.’s surveillance court to hold an open hearing into Apple’s
anticipated challenge of an alleged secret U.K. government
legal demand.</p>

<p>U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, along with four other federal lawmakers,
said <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/bipartisan-members-of-congress-to-uk-spy-court-uk-gag-orders-for-surveillance-backdoors-threaten-americans-security-and-privacy-impede-congressional-oversight">in a letter this week</a> to the president of the U.K.’s
Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) that it is “in the public
interest” that any hearings about the alleged order are not held
in secret.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We write to request the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) remove
the cloak of secrecy related to notices given to American
technology companies by the United Kingdom, which infringes on
free speech and privacy, undermines important United States
Congress and U.K. parliamentary oversight, harms national
security, and ultimately, undermines the special relationship
between the United States and the United Kingdom. [...]</p>

<p>Given the significant technical complexity of this issue, as well
as the important national security harms that will result from
weakening cybersecurity defenses, it is imperative that the U.K.’s
technical demands of Apple — and of any other U.S. companies — be subjected to robust, public analysis and debate by
cybersecurity experts. Secret court hearings featuring
intelligence agencies and a handful of individuals approved by
them do not enable robust challenges on highly technical matters.
Moreover, given the potential impact on U.S. national security, it
is vital that American cybersecurity experts be permitted to
analyze and comment on the security of what is proposed.</p>
