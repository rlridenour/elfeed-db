Apple may have updated several iPads and Macs late last year and early this year, but there are still multiple new devices that we're looking forward to seeing in 2025. Most will come in September or October, but there could be a few surprises before then.<br/>

<br/>
We've rounded up a list of everything that we're still waiting to see from Apple in 2025.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/"><strong>iPhone 17, 17 Air, and 17 Pro</strong></a> - We get new iPhones every September so it's not a surprise that updated models are coming, but this year should be exciting because the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">rumored iPhone 17 Air</a> will have an all-new ultra-thin form factor, plus the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max</a> are getting a new rear camera design.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 11</a></strong> - There's an updated Apple Watch coming, and it could get blood pressure monitoring and other health features, though that's not a guarantee yet. An update for watchOS has also been rumored, so it could get a new look.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Ultra 3</a></strong> - Apple didn't update the Apple Watch Ultra last year, but we're supposedly getting a new model this year.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a></strong> - We also didn't get an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> in 2024, so Apple's low-cost Apple Watch is due for an update. There were some rumors about a new plastic casing, but that might be scrapped.</li><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/"><strong>AirPods Pro 3</strong></a> - It's finally time for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> to get an update, and it sounds like it'll be a big one. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; will have a new design, and the case could get an update too. We're expecting better audio quality, Active Noise Cancellation improvements, a faster chip, and possibly health features like temperature and heart rate monitoring.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a></strong> - The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> is Apple's last Mac that doesn't have an M4 chip inside, and it's going to be refreshed before the end of the year.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></strong> - The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> was last updated in October 2024, but when October 2025 rolls around, it'll be due for another refresh. No major design changes are planned, but it will get a spec boost in the form of the faster M5 chip.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-apple-tv/">Apple TV 4K</a></strong> - It's been quite some time since the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> was refreshed, and a new model is in the works. It'll have a faster processor, perhaps even one that can support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> and console-quality games. No design changes are expected.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></strong> - The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> could get its first update with a faster S-series chip, an Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for improved performance, and new color options.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags-2/">AirTag 2</a></strong> - There's a new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> in the works, and it's slated for launch sometime in 2025. There are no signs of a design update, but it will get a new Ultra Wideband chip for improved range, plus there could be other improvements like a new, louder speaker.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
<h2>Bonus: New Software</h2><br/>
In two months, Apple is going to show off new software at its June Worldwide Developers Conference. We'll see the new features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, tvOS 19, watchOS 12, and visionOS 3.<br/>
<br/>
New software is fun because if you've got a modern Apple device, you don't even need to buy anything new to get the new functionality that Apple will be showing off. While we'll get a June preview, the software updates are slated for September.<br/>
