<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Duinhir finds a bit of rest then sets about helping those in Isengard.
</p>
        <p>Having traveled the first half of July, Duinhir has been told to wait until
August 1st to deliver his message to Saruman.  That’s 18 days of waiting around.</p>
<p>While spending July 13th and 14th resting<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> And converting his <i class="dfn">Fellowship Points</i>into <i class="dfn">Hope</i>.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
, he ponders what he’ll do as he
waits a fortnight to speak with Saruman.  This delay rubs against his very
nature.</p>
<p><em>Duinhir, you’re a long ways from your /<i class="dfn">Safe Haven</i>as well as from good ol’ Gandalf.  And now that you started erranding for wizards, you’ll likely end up being the chosen to all the wizards and Elf lords of Middle Earth.</em></p>
<p>A fleeting thought passes as if a high flying water fowl.</p>
<p><em>Now don’t you dare go ranging and risking the delivery of that message.  To anger a wizard is amongst the most foolish of things.  Simply look to this as a hobbit might, as a bit of a holiday.</em></p>
<p>That thought, of a holiday, fails to find purchase.  He instead turns looking to
the surrounding orchards with their young fruit; still a month or more from
harvest.</p>
<p><em>Duinhir, you’ve gotten off to a bumpy start here in Isengard.  Why not see about smoothing things over and maybe making this a welcoming place for future travels.</em></p>

<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>I’m looking to have Duinhir establish a <i class="dfn">Safe Haven</i>as a <i class="dfn">Skill Endeavor</i>.  And given the 17 days, this is plenty of time but is a daunting
task.  He’ll need 9 successes in 6 attempts.</small></p>
</section>

<p>First, Duinhir needs to understand the needs of those in Isengard.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>Before I throw Duinhir against this challenge, I as the <em>Loremaster</em> want to know
”What is the nature of the needs of those at Isengard?”  I get <em>Aspect:</em> Broken
and <em>Focus:</em> Patron.  My first thought is that Saruman has broken the trust of the
people at Isengard.  Another is that Saruman is overtaxing those under his
domain.</small></p>
</section>

<p>Duinhir spends the next few days (July 15th and 16th), mingling with the folks
of Isengard.  He’s curious how he might make friends, in part by sharing his
talents.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>He’s using his <em>Distinctive Feature</em> of “Folk-Lore” and spending a point of <em>Hope</em>
to test <em>Insight</em>.  Success {Skill: Insight, TN: 12, Roll: 17, Favourability:
Neutral, Feat Dice: 9, Success Dice: 2d6 (4, 4)}.  Duinhir needs 8 successes in
the next 5 rolls.</small></p>
</section>

<p>During those days, Duinhir learns that Saruman has begun sending folks to work
in a nearby mine.  This is voluntary, but draws adults away from their family as
they spend weeks working at the mine; a day’s travel away.</p>
<p>Listening Duinhir learns that the main challenge is folks being gone from home
for a fortnight or more.  And for these close knit families, that time away
disrupts the flow of life.</p>
<p>Speaking with a young man, home with his twin daughters, he hears of the
struggles of raising their young children as his husband works the mine.  The
girls ask of their other father, and speak of how much they miss him.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps he could set up a messenger service for these folk?  One to deliver
messages between the mining camp and home.</em></p>
<p>“People of Isengard, give me your letters that I might deliver them to your
friends and families at the mining camp.”</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>He’s using his <em>Distinctive Feature</em> of “True-hearted” and spending a point of
<em>Hope</em> to test <em>Enhearten</em>.  Success ᚠ {Skill: Enhearten, TN: 12, Roll: ᚠ,
Favourability: Favoured, Feat Dice: ᚠ, Success Dice: 2d6 (3, 3)}.  Duinhir needs
7 successes in the next 4 rolls.</small></p>
</section>

<p>People start spouting messages, but Duinhir directs them to write those messages
and that he’ll deliver them.</p>
<p>In the morning of July 17th, Duinhir departs with a rucksack full of letters.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>I call for a <em>Travel</em> test, and Duinhir eager to deliver these messages, invokes
his “Swift” <em>Distinctive Feature</em>.  Success 2Շ {Skill: Travel, TN: 12, Roll: 28,
Favourability: Favoured, Feat Dice: 6, Success Dice: 5d6 (5, 2, 6, 6, 3)}.  He
garners 3 successes, meaning he needs 4 successes in his next 3 rolls.</small></p>
</section>

<p>He journeys to the mining camp, with the wind at his back, song birds singing a
traveling song, and his swaying rucksack laden with letters bringing a sense of
joy.</p>
<p>As an experienced ranger and traveler, he arrives with a few hours of light to
spare.  The camp is orderly, with a wooden tower keeping watch of the
surroundings.  As he approaches, a woman in the tower hollars, “Hail traveler,
name thyself and tell us what brings you to this lonely corner?”</p>
<p>“I’m Tailwind. And I come from Isengard, bearing letters from family and
friends.”</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>This sounds like a <em>Courtesy</em> test.  And I’ll again invoke the “True-Hearted”
<em>Distinctive Feature</em>.  Success {Skill: Courtesy, TN: 12, Roll: 13,
Favourability: Favoured, Feat Dice: 7, Success Dice: 3d6 (4 1 1)}.  Duinhir will
need 3 successes in his next 2 rolls.</small></p>
</section>

<p>“Oh bearer of letters of love and friendship, fair Tailwind, you are most
welcome to join us for dinner and song,” said the woman from the wooden tower.</p>
<p>Duinhir noted that as she responded, her shoulders dropped a bit, likely
lowering and relaxing the draw of a bow.</p>
<p>The smell of roasting vegetables and meat greets Duinhir as he listens to a
song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>In evening on we eat our share<br />
Of mutton and vegetables to spare<br />
Our days all dark save lantern light<br />
And slivered moon waits on us tonight.<br /></p>
</div>
<p>The camp has one long hall with a large awning running its length.  Beneath the
awning several tables, full of miners singing and eating.  Three cooks tend the
nearby kitchen building, pulling trays from the oven, loading dishes, and
bringing them to the eager tables.</p>
<p>The chorus of voices trails off, as folks look to the arrival of Duinhir.</p>
<p>Duinhir, recognizing the melody, bellows the chorus:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>Oh we work and toil<br />
And dig in soil<br />
So our family dear<br />
May eat this year.<br /></p>
</div>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>Sounds like <em>Song</em>, invoking the “Folk-Lore” <em>Distinctive Feature</em>.  Dropping <em>Hope</em>
to 7.  Failure {Skill: Song, TN: 12, Roll: 10, Favourability: Neutral, Feat
Dice: 3, Success Dice: 3d6 (4, 2, 1)}.  I need 3 successes on the next roll.</small></p>
</section>

<p>The miners stop eating and singing, and the cooks stand with arms holding trays
of bowls of vegetables.  All eyes turning to the tall road dusted traveler.</p>
<p>“Who the hell are you?  Certainly no troubadour,” barks a hairy broad shouldered
man.</p>
<p>“Kind folk, apologies, for I, Tailwind, knew the song and figured I’d join in.
But my throat is parched from a dusty trip from Isengard,” said Duinhir, “More
important than my singing, however, is that I bring letters from loved ones.”</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>Let’s make a <em>Courtesy</em> test, and invoking the “True-Hearted” <em>Distinctive Feature</em>.
Lowering <em>Hope</em> to 6.  Success ᚠ 1Շ {Skill: Courtesy, TN: 12, Roll: ᚠ,
Favourability: Favoured, Feat Dice: ᚠ, Success Dice: 3d6 (6, 4, 1)}.  The
endeavor fails, needing one more success.</small></p>
</section>

<p>It takes a moment for each person, sitting and listening to the visitor, to
register Duinhir’s words.  And quickly, as a hawk diving towards a mouse in the
open field, they rise, and scurry towards Duinhir, reaching and grasping for
their letters as Duinhir calls out their names.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>While Duinhir’s efforts doesn’t secure a <em>Safe Haven</em>, I think it has helped make
future attempts easier.</small></p>
</section>

<p>Duinhir smiles as folks mob him for their letters.  Each person greedily
clutching their envelopes and scurrying back to their dinner.  Some read aloud,
others quietly, and still others asking for help in reading.  A quiet joy
settles upon the mining community.</p>
<p>“Come, Tailwind, join us in our humble meal,” says the broad shoulder hairy man,
“I am Aldrif, you have brought us all joy this day.  Come drink and mend that
parched voice of yours.”</p>
<p>Duinhir sets down his pack joining Aldrif others for a much appreciated hot
meal.</p>
<p>“Now, good Aldrif, what may I ask ails this community?” asks Duinhir, knowing he
has little under a fortnight (13 remaining days) before he will speak with
Saruman.  Plenty of time to help a community.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My initial thoughts was that Duinhir’s endeavor would be to deliver letters,
then establish a letter delivery routine.  However, I wanted to use skill tests
to check the responses of folk.  I felt that those checks worked well enough
towards the <em>Skill Endeavor</em> that I counted them towards that effort.</p>
<p>What this has meant is Duinhir has failed at his initial attempt.  Simply
delivering messages once was not enough.  But I’ll build from that.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a reader reached out thanking me for writing 
.  We had a great conversation, and I remembered how much I
enjoyed playing this solo game.  In fact, much of this was written during a
lunch hour.</p>
<p>One hiccup I encountered is that my original randomizers in Emacs are partially
broken.  Mostly because I’m midway through refactoring the original randomizers
to use <span><a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/random-table.el/">my random-tables Emacs package</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “my random-tables Emacs package”" title="Other site-wide references of “my random-tables Emacs package”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-MY-RANDOM-TABLES-EMACS-PACKAGE">&#128214;</a></small>
