The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/beats-charging-cables/">new Beats charging cables</a> added to <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all/beats?f=cable&fh=46ea%2B45c4&page=1">Apple's online store</a> on Tuesday can also be purchased at Apple's physical stores in many countries starting today.<br/>

The cables are available in a variety of colors and lengths, with USB-C to USB-C, USB-C to USB-A, and USB-C to Lightning options. All of the cables have a Beats logo, along with a woven design that increases durability and helps to prevent tangles. In the U.S., prices range from &#36;18.99 to &#36;34.99 for one to two cables.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, this is Apple's first own USB-C to USB-A cable, which could be popular for CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, there is nothing extraordinary about these cables, and many cheaper alternatives that are functionally equivalent are available on Amazon.<br/>

Beats has shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GtnMh38LuA">another ad for the cables</a> on its YouTube channel.<br/>
