iOS 27 will reportedly have two major elements: quality improvements and new AI features.<br/>

In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter today, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-23/apple-ios-27-snow-leopard-like-quality-focus-ai-features-tim-cook-retirement-mibq7jv8"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said</a> that iOS 27 will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/mac-os-x-snow-leopard-15-years/">similar to Mac OS X Snow Leopard</a>, in the sense that Apple is focused on improving "quality and underlying performance" over adding new features.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said there is one exception to this rule, though, as he expects there to be new AI features. He said that iOS 27 will extend artificial intelligence to additional Apple apps, and he reiterated that there will be an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/10/ai-apple-health-service-still-coming/">Apple Health+ subscription service</a> that offers personalized health recommendations and more.<br/>
<br/>
He said this focus on improved quality over new features also applies to macOS 27.<br/>
<br/>
The first betas of iOS 27, macOS 27, and other corresponding updates should be released shortly after Apple's annual developers conference WWDC next June.<br/>
