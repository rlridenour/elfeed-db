All the really boring stuff. Also, how to keep our team members happy.</p><p><strong>How long working at Fastmail, how did you get involved?</strong></p><p>10 months. I was looking for a role in an IT company. I heard of Fastmail many years ago when I first started my IT degree, and Fastmail was leading the email industry.</p><p>I’m Fastmail’s first people and culture hire. The exciting part was starting from a blank slate — it’s been a good opportunity to look at how to align our teams, which are global with many remote team members.</p><p><strong>What’s a project you have worked on that you’re particularly proud of?</strong></p><p>Implementation of a skill and career framework which has created equality for all our team members globally, and is allowing us to look at what skills we need for the future.</p><p><strong>Who is somebody who inspires you?</strong></p><p>Early on in life it was Mother Theresa, because she just wanted to help everybody — but she didn’t hesitate to break the mould. Something I learned being a female in IT, you never can hesitate to break the mould.</p><p><strong>What are your favourite Fastmail features?</strong></p><p>Memos! It means I can keep information about something without having to go out to a separate tool. It took me a while to get used to conversation mode, but I’ve found it useful to help my husband manage his time better — I’ve taught him how to use conversations and colour coding to keep track of things.</p><p><strong>Other than Fastmail, what’s your favourite or most used piece of technology?</strong></p><p>My robot that mops and vacuums at the same time! It notices when it’s on carpet and lifts the mop. It saves me tons of time and I can vacuum the floor every day.</p><p><strong>What are you listening to these days?</strong></p><p>John Farhnam — I did the backing for Age of Reason! You can see tiny little me in the music video. I also enjoy Guy Sebastian, Adele, that type of music. I also love musicals. I’m old school, I love music that wasn’t created by computer. My grandfather was a concert pianist.</p><p><strong>What do you like to do outside of work?</strong></p><p>I like to challenge myself. I built outside stairs last week, now I need to repaint the whole deck to match them. I love working in the garden. I make resin chopping boards and sell them at the market.</p><p><strong>What’s your favourite animal?</strong></p><p>My puppy dog. I love dogs, especially my puppy Baxter.</p><p><strong>Any Fastmail staff you want to brag on?</strong></p><p>All of them. We’ve achieved a lot in the last 12 months, and everyone really lives the Fastmail culture.</p><p><strong>What do you like best about working at Fastmail?</strong></p><p>The people and their commitment. It’s been great helping everyone find the type of growth that works best for them, and creating a culture at Fastmail that truly aligns with what we believe in.</p>
