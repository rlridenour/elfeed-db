</><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A morning #poem.
</p>
        <div class="verse">
<p>Our face, sub one for another,<br />
Are we still the same?<br />
And our top?  And bottom?<br />
Identity hinted in three parts.<br />
<br />
But it is all flat,<br />
     An illusion.<br />
For we are not our parts<br />
But something more…<br />
Blossoming and growing<br />
in our imaginations.<br />
<br />
Turn our heads, look around<br />
     see in 360.<br />
We are many, different<br />
in inks, dyes, and<br />
how we accessorize.<br />
Yet at our core, we<br />
share so much more.<br />
<br />
Our backs are stiff,<br />
but we can’t nor won’t<br />
bend the knee.<br />
<br />
Though small, we are many<br />
And all fear to trod upon us.<br /></p>
