<p>Venezuela&#x27;s government ordered a nationwide military mobilisation and staged exercises amid fears of a possible US attack, saying it would put its armed forces — including militias — on high alert. The move came as the US Navy&#x27;s USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group moved into Caribbean waters after months of U.S. military buildup in the region; Washington says deployments aim to disrupt narcotics trafficking. Regional reporting and U.S. accounts say recent U.S. strikes on suspected drug-smuggling vessels have killed dozens, increasing tensions between Caracas and Washington.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/jWR7O8FXxUE2b5Dfb-IJK2FDSotpHhYZvVW8KRpsFG2a2KVm-eoh-Dvm0pYaac1WkWoeowMyXlsyMRN8qj4xZWuLQmho0T0xO1WU2TfjiMVP98U1c-9CyE-8s0JQj5sevN1coT2vGMjscSL_62vA8k3CVjMZRtkfXunMAQS_XZMZJg_DnhfgridFy79xYAGDMPfk1_DrmYkQpg6tCpgb6w4mOL-qTpGXznShHyRc-XK1RGUMnpRM_gXL0-UOMGSIvGnqR6CMXUNYgGLMfw' alt='The USS Gerald R.
