<p>Iranian authorities have arrested at least four prominent figures linked to the country’s reformist camp, including Azar Mansouri, a leading figure in the Reform Front umbrella coalition. The detentions follow nationwide protests and signal a widening campaign against dissent—one that now reaches into established political networks, not just street-level activists. The arrests come as Iran also weighs renewed diplomacy with Washington, with outlets pointing to the timing as nuclear talks resume. Separately, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi—already imprisoned—received an additional sentence of more than seven years, underscoring the judiciary’s hard line during this period.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/HFkMm6i6RP2op3qtf3KzlZ1JgzBqCo9YhvYgBW-8hCrKrziBws6ntNqKjeYolXn037-am_Ir6HyJ81WcsdzsoYwullPIuNUDDFY69fuoZJpI0Nz722F5L4qF-cUnGg7Dvb6t1SdfSzo07pATpNeSy1FK3duMRwDa2-A37krm3FfwzIBNAofkhwrU2NSezyHiPHB5JL7bIJYmC3xc1XND353oorWhS7E-xzlU2xm4__tnXUlMHsb4ra_0b7vcN8KHQycWG4H79kyHQuIVrw' alt='Image accompanying reporting on the arrests of Iranian reformist figures.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>IRGC involvement: The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps arrested Mansouri, The Guardian reported.</li><li>Protest criticism: The Guardian said Mansouri expressed deep sorrow over protesters’ deaths and criticized the authorities’ handling of the protests, saying nothing could justify such a catastrophe.</li><li>Khamenei stance: The Guardian reported that Mansouri has not publicly called for Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to resign.</li><li>Regional pressure context: Euronews said the detentions come as Iran resumes nuclear talks with Washington while facing rising military threats from the US and Israel.</li><li>Domestic political fallout: The Guardian said detaining senior Reform Front figures would likely deepen tensions over how the recent street protests were handled.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Islamic Iran Nation’s Union Party: The party called for Azar Mansouri’s release after her detention, according to Shargh newspaper.
