<p>Writing at The Verge (paywalled), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/770599/apple-arcade-interview-alex-rothman">Ash Parrish talks to Apple Arcade senior director Alex Rothman</a> about the state of the service. It’s not the most in-depth of interviews, but it’s always interesting when an Apple executive is willing to go on the record. This part in particular jumped out at me:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “By no means are we going all into only IP,” Rothman said. “It’s a broad mix, because we have a broad player base.” And while Rothman understands the criticisms Arcade has faced, he says Apple is invested in Arcade for the long haul. <strong>“We care very deeply about games,” he said. “Not just the Arcade team, it’s across the company.”</strong> [emphasis added]
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sure there are things that Apple likes about Arcade, like having a big backlog of games to point to (Rothman says there are more than 250 now). I’m also interested by Apple working as a publisher to bring together developers and IP holders; that’s a smart use of the company’s clout.</p>
<p>But the idea that Apple cares “very deeply” about games? It’s pretty hard to stomach that <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/05/apple-reportedly-trying-to-revamp-gaming-for-the-1735th-time/">after all these years</a>. Arcade feels pretty scattershot to me; I can’t remember the last time I played a game there. Like, I’d wager, many other customers, I get the service for free as part of the Apple One bundle, and I definitely get the feeling that the higher echelons of Apple see it as little more than a “nice to have” value-add. I’d like to be proven wrong, but I don’t see it happening anytime soon.</p>
