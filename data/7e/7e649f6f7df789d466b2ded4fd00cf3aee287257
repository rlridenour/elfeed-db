<p>It was only last week when I upgraded to Emacs 29.2. Yup, I was late to the party. This week, we have a new release.</p>
<p>Emacs 29.3 is an <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-03/msg00611.html">emergency bugfix release</a>, so this time I've upgraded promptly. I'm on macOS using the great <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus">Emacs Plus</a> so upgraded via <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">brew reinstall emacs-plus@29 --with-imagemagick --with-no-frame-refocus --with-native-comp --with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-3d-icon --with-poll
</code></pre>
