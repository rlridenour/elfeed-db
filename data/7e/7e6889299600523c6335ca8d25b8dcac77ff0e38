Over at <a href="https://taonaw.com">The Art Of Not Asking Why</a>, JTR suspects that I may be an apostate, or at least that I&rsquo;m inconsistent. He notes, correctly, that I&rsquo;m all in on Emacs in general and Org mode in particular, and yet I&rsquo;ve lately expressed enthusiasm for the non-Emacs app <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/tips/round-ups/journelly-journal-app-ios/">Journelly</a>. He wonders why. It&rsquo;s a good question and an honest one that deserves an answer. I&rsquo;m sure others are wondering too.
</p>
<p>
I explained my initial attraction in my <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12842">first post on Journelly</a>. The TL;DR is that I use the Apple Notes app to keep a running memo book of each day&rsquo;s events but that I was looking for something a bit better. Journelly seemed like it might be an answer so I resolved to keep an eye on it. Shortly afterwards, Ramírez started a formal beta program and after some initial dithering <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12880">I signed up</a> and started playing with Journelly.
</p>
<p>
I will shortly write about my experiences with it but in this post I want to address why a dedicated Emacs/Org mode user, who writes virtually everything in Org mode, might want to use Journelly. The thing is <i>even I</i> am not always on my computer. Sometimes I&rsquo;m out and about, and sometimes I&rsquo;m just doing other things. That means that I&rsquo;ll be using my iPhone. Apple&rsquo;s policy prohibiting apps with interpreters means that Emacs will never be on iOS but even if it were, I can&rsquo;t imagine that the experience would be very pleasant. What I need is a way of easily adding entries to my Memo Book and having those entries sync across all my devices, including my Mac.
</p>
<p>
That&rsquo;s where Journelly shines. Although the beautiful iPhone display doesn&rsquo;t suggest it, the records are actually recorded in standard Org mode. Since it&rsquo;s also possible to store the Journelly files in the iCloud, you can get access to them with a Mac, iPad, or, I suppose, another iPhone.
</p>
<p>
Jack Baty has a <a href="https://baty.net/posts/2025/04/journelly-org-mode-backed-journaling-for-i-os/">nice post</a> that describes how he&rsquo;s sharing data between his iPhone and his Mac. He even has an Org template to capture entries on his Mac. It&rsquo;s actually trivial and at this point I&rsquo;m sharing Journelly data between my iPhone, Mac, and iPad.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Álvaro Ramírez also saw JTR&rsquo;s post and wrote <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/journelly-vs-emacs-why-not-both">his own answer</a>. The TL;DR there is, &ldquo;Why not both?&rdquo; Like me, he was looking for an easy way to take notes when he wasn&rsquo;t at his computer but wanted to be able to access and edit them in Org mode as usual when he was. That&rsquo;s why he arranged for the records to be kept in Org mode format.
</p>
<p>
Sure, as JTR says, there are apps like Beorg but they, while great, aren&rsquo;t targeted at my—and presumably Ramírez&rsquo;s—needs. It&rsquo;s not a matter of choosing between Org and some proprietary app; it&rsquo;s about choosing a useful Org front end for your iPhone.
</p>
<p>
As a coda to this post, JTR notes in a <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/04/02/correction-about-journelly.html">subsequent post</a> that he didn&rsquo;t realize that Journelly kept its records in Org format and now that he does, he better understands my attraction to it.</p>
