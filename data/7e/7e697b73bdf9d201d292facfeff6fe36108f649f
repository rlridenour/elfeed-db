The feature is rolling out in beta this week via the Claude iOS app, Anthropic announced as part of a <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/healthcare-life-sciences">broader healthcare push</a>. U.S. subscribers on Claude Pro and Max plans can opt in to share their data, including movement, sleep, and activity patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Once connected, Claude can summarize medical history, explain test results, detect patterns across fitness metrics, and help users prepare questions for doctor appointments. HealthEx and Function connectors are also available in beta.<br/>
<br/>
Anthropic says the integrations are "private by design." Users choose exactly what they share, must explicitly opt in, and can revoke access at any time. Health data isn't used to train models, according to the company.<br/>

The announcement comes two weeks after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/07/openai-chatgpt-health-apple-health-integration/">OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health</a> with its own Apple Health connector.
