<p>You can check it out <a href="https://hugoheagren.com/practical-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Below are some of the things on his list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a reference manager.</li>
<li>Use a password manager.</li>
<li>Keep templates for types of emails you&#8217;ll send a lot.</li>
<li>Keep notes on pretty much everything. It’s easy to write something down, especially on a computer. If you’ve written it down, the worst that can happen is that you never look at it again. But if you <em>don’t</em> write it down the worst that can happen is that you want to look at it again, and can’t.</li>
<li>Buy a second laptop charger and leave it at campus, so that you don’t have to lug it to work and back every day.</li>
<li>Whenever you distribute your papers/chapters/writing, use PDF.</li>
<li>Ensure your computer has a proper PDF reader.</li>
<li>Learn to touch type.</li>
<li>Learn how Outlook works.</li>
<li>Back up your data regularly (either through a cloud service or external drives).</li>
<li>Have a website.</li>
<li>Get a passport.</li>
<li>Buy a good suitcase.</li>
<li>See if your university offers travel insurance.</li>
</ul>
