<p>Installed Emacs again on Pop OS (I wiped it after my GPU issues), and now I realize I&rsquo;ve had this weird issue in org-mode, where images are displayed in landscape mode. Some of my images are rotated 90 degrees in the wrong direction. Anyone familiar with this, what causes it, and how to fix it?</p>
