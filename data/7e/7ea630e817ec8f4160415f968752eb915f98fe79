The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> that Apple is expected to unveil tomorrow will not include notable improvements to audio quality or Active Noise Cancellation, according to <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1965183342518870323"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

Apple's new earbuds will have heart rate tracking, a health-related feature that Apple first introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-announced/">with the Powerbeats Pro 2</a>. LED optical sensors will pulse to measure heart rate using blood flow, and if the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; work like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2, the data will sync with popular fitness apps.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; will also feature an updated design for a better fit, though there are no details on what exactly is going to change. The case is also going to be slimmed down, and it will be smaller like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> case.<br/>

New chips typically mean improvements to audio quality and ANC, and we could still get some small boosts, but it sounds like most of the focus will be on the new health feature.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/08/airpods-pro-3-no-major-anc-improvement/">AirPods Pro 3 Won&#039;t Get &#039;Major&#039; Audio or Active Noise Cancellation Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-3-wont-get-major-audio-or-active-noise-cancellation-improvements.2464865/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
