(More recently,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-wild-history-of-poison-rings">poison rings</a>&nbsp;gave rise to a popular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/crystalro/varys-rings-theory-daenerys-game-of-thrones"><em>Game of Thrones</em> fan theory</a>…)</p>
<p>Victorians&nbsp;prevented their most closely kept secrets—illicit love letters, perhaps? Last wills and testaments?—from falling into the wrong hands by wearing the&nbsp;<a href="https://ericaweiner.com/products/victorian-carnelian-concealed-key-ring">keys</a>&nbsp;to the boxes containing these items concealed in signet rings and other statement-type pieces.</p>

<p>A tiny concealed blade could be lethal on the finger of a skilled (and no doubt, beautiful) assassin. These days, they might be used to collect a bit of one’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defenderring.com/">attacker’s DNA</a>.</p>
<p>Enter the fictional world of James Bond, and you’ll find a number of handy dandy spy rings including one that doubles as a&nbsp;camera, and another capable of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelegendofq.co.uk/unbreakable-glass-smashing-ring.html">shattering bulletproof glass with a single twist</a>.</p>

<p>Armillary sphere rings like the ones in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1888-1201-316" rel="nofollow">the British Museum’s collection</a>&nbsp;and the Swedish Historical Museum (top) serve a more benign purpose. Folded together, the two-part outer hoop and three interior hoops give the illusion of a simple gold band. Slipped off the wearer’s finger, they can fan out into a physical model of celestial longitude and latitude.</p>

<p><a href="https://mymodernmet.com/armillary-sphere-finger-ring/">Art historian Jessica Stewart writes</a>&nbsp;that in the 17th century, rings such as the above specimen were “used by astronomers to study and make calculations.
