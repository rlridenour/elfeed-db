<p>France held nationwide commemorations on 13 November 2025 to mark ten years since the coordinated November 13, 2015 attacks in Paris that killed between 130 and 132 people and wounded hundreds, with ceremonies led by President Emmanuel Macron and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo. The government staged tributes at multiple sites connected to the assaults — including memorials for the Bataclan and other locations — while survivors and families gathered to remember victims and press for continued support for those still affected. Officials and commentators noted that the attacks reshaped France&#x27;s counterterrorism focus and that the trauma endures for many survivors even a decade later.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/jexH9_3XCWT_mqbkVSn0iYy47DN133O8jjNfM_GCvhplsuXfOIwU10joFy2gpn2GH6nbfUgow9xMFmyR2uVSRAcyaea4C0vzdlV_6-H5RFmYJxpGv8vfyd7CyCTZ-zUZcOzXB4T6adHU4m-KMqlRu3HiBAfnIQggmrkdNc72HmfoRZeNJ3Bmkqzn1wf5LUlopN3OLPNRm3-8m2_HyTbdTNFbC-f79Lh1LAoEiG4mqFUTOn5anp4' alt='Mourners attend a vigil for victims of the Nov. 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris during earlier commemorations.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Survivor resilience: Several survivors have documented long-term recovery paths—some channel recovery through art and music, others still cope with chronic pain and psychological trauma, and a number say the 2021 trial helped some victims &#x27;come to terms&#x27; with the attacks</li><li>Ongoing security concerns: Authorities continue to guard against lingering threats: French police made a recent arrest linked to an alleged plot and analysts warn jihadist groups have adapted since 2015, maintaining global reach in new regions</li><li>Nationwide ceremonies: Commemorations were spread across multiple Paris sites and nationwide tributes, combining state-led ceremonies with local vigils and live coverage for families and the public</li><li>Jihadist evolution: Experts say Islamic State and al‑Qaida have reconfigured since 2015—losing territorial sanctuaries in Syria and Iraq while activity increased in parts of Africa, altering counterterrorism priorities</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Emmanuel Macron: President Macron led national ceremonies to honour victims and signalled the state&#x27;s continued commitment to remembrance and security for citizens.
