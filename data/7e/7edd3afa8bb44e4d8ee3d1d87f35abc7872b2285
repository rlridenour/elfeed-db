On August 19-20, Apple engineers and Michigan State University experts will consult with small- and medium-sized businesses on how they can implement AI and other technologies to enhance manufacturing, according to the announcement.<br/>
<br/>
The sessions will focus on machine learning, automation, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The two-day event is just one aspect of the Apple Manufacturing Academy. Apple engineers are also offering in-person and virtual consulting services. And later this year, the academy will offer virtual programming.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple works with suppliers in all 50 states because we know advanced manufacturing is vital to American innovation and leadership," said Apple's COO Sabih Khan. "With this new programming, we're thrilled to help even more businesses implement smart manufacturing so they can unlock amazing opportunities for their companies and our country."<br/>

Apple says this initiative is part of the company's pledge to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/apple-announces-500b-us-investment-plan/">spend more than &#36;500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years</a>. <br/>
