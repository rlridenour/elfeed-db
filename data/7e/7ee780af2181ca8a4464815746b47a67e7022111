The rumors indicate Apple's popular high-end earbuds should see a slimmer form factor, a faster audio chip with improved Active Noise Cancelation, in-ear heart-rate tracking similar to that which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-announced/">debuted on Powerbeats Pro 2 a few months ago</a>, and more, so check out our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/18/airpods-pro-3-upgrades-worth-waiting-for/">overview of everything we know</a> about the AirPods Pro 3.<br/>

<h2>iOS 18.5 Includes Only a Few Changes So Far</h2><br/>
This week saw the release of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/21/ios-18-5-beta-3-developers/">new iOS 18.5 beta for developers</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/apple-ios-18-5-public-beta-2/">public beta testers</a>, but so far we're <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/21/ios-18-5-two-changes-so-far/">seeing very few changes in store for this update</a>, with really only a couple of tweaks to the Mail and Settings apps discovered so far.<br/>

A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/when-will-ios-18-5-be-released/">mid-May public release for iOS 18.5 seems likely</a>, but Apple is largely turning its attention to iOS 19 at this point, and we'll be seeing that unveiled at WWDC in early June.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 17 Pro Allegedly Coming in Sky Blue Color Used for MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Apple's Pro iPhone models typically come in a handful of neutral color options with one additional color that changes from year to year and stands out a bit more. For the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max coming in September, it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/iphone-17-pro-sky-blue-color/">sounds like that could be a Sky Blue color</a> similar to the one that appeared on the latest MacBook Air.<br/>

We're <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/iphone-17-pro-13-new-features/">expecting quite a few changes for the iPhone 17 Pro</a>, with the most immediately obvious one being a significantly larger rear camera bump.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Siri Management Team Gets Overhaul After Apple Intelligence Failure</h2><br/>
As part of the leadership shakeup in the wake delays in the development of an Apple Intelligence-powered Siri revamp, new boss Mike Rockwell is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/siri-management-team-overhaul/">shaking up the Siri management team</a> to try to breathe new life into the project and get it back on track.<br/>

The move comes as Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/21/apple-intelligence-clean-up-ad/">continues to promote Apple Intelligence features that are available like Clean Up in the Photos app</a>, although the company has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/apple-intelligence-available-now-text-removed/">pulled back on some of its "available now" marketing for Apple Intelligence</a> after push-back from a consumer advocacy group.<br/>
