<blockquote><p>
Travelling to England with his wife and daughter in the Norwegian freighter <em>Halibut</em>, which ran into rough seas, [Sir Robert Menzies] sent this cable to relatives:</p>
<p>At sea off Perth: Exodus X, 23.</p>
<p>In the Bible they found these words:</p>
<p>They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days.
