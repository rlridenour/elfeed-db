Would you like to work on the front lines of contemporary management?</p>
<p>
The Lucid Manager is hiring, and we are looking for people that <strong>don&#39;t fit</strong> the culture of their current work and have difficulty being aligned with corporate goals. At the Lucid Manager, we believe that the only thing you have to be brought into line with is yourself.</p>
<p>
We acknowledge that deviant behaviour and taking calculated risks is the foundation of innovation. We, therefore, look for independent critical thinkers who can add value. </p>
<p>
If this were a genuine recruitment add, it would have been a very odd one indeed. Most companies are looking for so-called alignment and matching cultural values. At The Lucid Manager, we believe that this will lead to a
<a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/positive-workplace-deviance/">severe lack of innovation</a>.</p>
<p>
The major corporate collapses and scandals of the recent years have caused a tightening of corporate governance, and many organisations have moved away from open models of leadership that value self-initiative to more regimented models of management.</p>
<p>
Even though the western world is waging war to spread democracy around the globe, the one aspect that dominates most people&#39;s lives, their workplaces, are ideally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy">meritocracies</a> but are mostly more like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship">dictatorships</a>. Most organisations are managed through clear hierarchical lines, and people are not very likely to go against the grain.</p>

Deviant Behaviour is neccesary
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Research shows that employees do not only remain silent because of a fear of retribution but also because it is perceived as a <a href="http://hbr.org/2010/06/debunking-four-myths-about-employee-silence/ar/1">waste of their time</a>. This silence creates psychological tension and cognitive dissonance and eventually less commitment to organisational goals.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>
Organisational deviance is, however, a significant source of innovation. Without the freedom to make mistakes, there can be no learning. The current wave of tightened corporate governance leads to the silencing of dissenting voices and pruning of innovative actions. The ultimate consequence of this is the impoverishment of management practices.</p>
