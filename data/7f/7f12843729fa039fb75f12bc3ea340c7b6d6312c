<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613307/netflix-apple-tv-app-support-mistake">According to The Verge</a>, Netflix has said this integration was in error and is being rolled back. Boo, I say. Boo. As Six Colors contributor <a href="https://joe-steel.com/2025-02-14-Netflix-Says-Its-Brief-Apple-TV-App-Integration-Was-a-Mistake.html">Joe Rosensteel wrote</a>, “Netflix deeply regrets accidentally making Netflix a better product for its customers.”</em></p>
<p>Just yesterday on our <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">Six Colors podcast</a>, I suggested it was high time for Apple and Netflix to make a deal to get Netflix content in the Apple TV app. And it seems maybe, at long last, after years of no movement, <em>finally</em> such a deal is happening?</p>
<p>After hearing from a member in <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/members/">The Incomparable’s Discord</a> that they’d gotten Netflix’s <em>Midnight Mass</em> to show up in their watchlist, I decided to give their method a shot. I searched for the show in tvOS’s unified search, hit the Open In… button, and sure enough was prompted if I wanted to connect Netflix to the Apple TV app.</p>

<p>Yes, please.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since doing that (and verifying that Netflix does now appear in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; TV under the Connect to Tv section) I’ve been unable to actually get any shows to appear in my own watchlist, despite starting several episodes of various series. If this is indeed rolling out—as other places, such as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/14/netflix-shows-start-appearing-in-apple-tv-app-unified-watchlist/">9to5Mac</a>, are also now reporting—it’s doing so gradually.</p>
<p>But an end to our long national nightmare might finally be in sight and maybe the TV app will finally fulfill its destiny of being the place to see everything you want to watch. All it needs now is a <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/apple-should-embrace-the-live-tv-grid-fast/">live TV grid</a>.</p>
