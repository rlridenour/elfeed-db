<p id="p2"><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-is-the-exclusive-new-broadcast-partner-for-formula-1-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple announced</a> today that it will be the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for Formula 1 racing. The five-year deal begins next year and will also include integrations with Apple News, Maps, Music, and Fitness+.</p>
<p id="p3">Eddy Cue, Apple&rsquo;s senior vice president of Services, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-is-the-exclusive-new-broadcast-partner-for-formula-1-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">said of the deal</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  We&rsquo;re thrilled to expand our relationship with Formula 1 and offer Apple TV subscribers in the U.S. front-row access to one of the most exciting and fastest-growing sports on the planet. 2026 marks a transformative new era for Formula 1, from new teams to new regulations and cars with the best drivers in the world, and we look forward to delivering premium and innovative fan-first coverage to our customers in a way that only Apple can.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">Apple says that its streaming subscribers will have access to all practice, qualifying, Sprint sessions, and Grands Prix and that certain races and practice sessions will be available for free in the TV app. Apple TV subscribers will also have exclusive access to F1&nbsp;TV Premium, F1&rsquo;s premium content service, at no extra cost. Apple says it will release more information about F1 product integrations in the coming months.</p>
<p id="p6">This deal has been rumored for a long time and makes a lot of sense for Apple, which has been working to add internationally popular sports to its lineup for some time. Along with MLS and select weekly baseball games, the company has a much more robust sports package than ever before, which should make Apple TV attractive to a broader audience.</p>
