By now, everyone knows about Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers&rsquo; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">decision</a> that Apple can no longer refuse to let apps link to payment methods outside of the iOS app system. The idea was that if you ordered anything through an iOS app, Apple would get a percentage of the sale. Everybody but Apple hated the policy.

<p>
I&rsquo;m conflicted on the matter. My inclination is to side with Apple. After all, they built the iOS app platform—without which, by the way, those complaining wouldn&rsquo;t even exist—and they should get to set the rules. I think it&rsquo;s a huge stretch to claim that setting those rules is somehow an antitrust issue. Others obviously <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2772401/apple-goodwill-risk.html">disagree</a>.
</p>
<p>
I don&rsquo;t write iOS apps so my perspective is that of a user. One aspect of that use is the iOS Kindle app. Often, when I finish reading a book, there&rsquo;s a recommendation for the next book in the series. If I liked the book, I will usually order the next book to read later. It&rsquo;s not a seamless process. I have to leave the Kindle app, go to the browser, bring up the Amazon site, search for the book, and, finally, order it.

<p>
Now, happily, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661719/amazon-app-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-kindle-buy-books">that has changed</a>. The Kindle app now has a button that allows you to go to the book&rsquo;s Amazon page and order it right from the app. I&rsquo;m really happy about that but I can&rsquo;t help thinking that it&rsquo;s not right. It&rsquo;s almost as if I&rsquo;m abetting theft from Apple. As I said, Apple built the platform and others came along and claimed rights to it.

I get that app developers are living on the edge and I <i>do</i> think that Apple can afford to and should let them suggest other payment options. And really, most of us are going to take the easy option and order through the app anyway. Still, it&rsquo;s Apple&rsquo;s platform and they should get to set the rules. If you don&rsquo;t like the rules, build your own platform. If you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s possible, ask  Steve Jobs or Jeff Besos.</p>
