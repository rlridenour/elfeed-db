<p>Window managers don’t make sense to me.</p>
<p>I have tried a whole host of them.</p>

<p>I have used a workflow each in <a href="https://alfredapp.com/" target="_blank">Alfred</a> and <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/" target="_blank">Keyboard Maestro</a> to manage my windows.</p>
<p>I don’t get the utility.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>, there was a plugin called <a href="https://github.com/SublimeText/Origami" target="_blank">Origami</a> which I tried out. It was interesting, but never became essential to me.</p>
<p>I am a one document, one application at a time, kind of guy. Boring, but that is the way my mind works.</p>
<p>I am fond of the following keyboard commands:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>⌘-tab</strong>: to switch between open applications.</li>
<li><strong>‌⌘-`</strong>: to move between open windows in an application.</li>
<li><strong>⌘-H</strong>: Hide the current application and switch to the one last used.</li>
<li><strong>‌⌥⌘-H</strong> Hide all the other applications running.</li>
<li><strong>‌⌃-tab</strong>: To move to the tab on the right.</li>
<li><strong>‌⇧⌃-tab</strong>: To move to the tab on the left.</li>
</ol>
<p>I rarely use Spaces. I use tabs. Tabs in browsers. Tabs in Emacs. Tabs in iA Writer. Tabs everywhere.</p>
<h2 id="terminal">Terminal</h2>
<p>I can see the advantages of window managers in the Terminal. If you need to move between open buffers in a terminal based text editor like <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank">Neovim</a>, or manage different terminal windows performing different tasks, it might make sense to have a window manager manage that function. I don’t usually use terminal based text editors, so it doesn’t apply to my use-case. On the other hand, when I do use one of those, I am focused on a window at a time and don’t feel the need for a window manager.</p>
<p>BTW, I ran into a new text editor in the terminal called <a href="https://sinelaw.github.io/fresh/" target="_blank">Fresh</a>. It is nice.</p>
<h2 id="emacs">Emacs</h2>
<p>I use the built-in window manager functions in Emacs, when I need to. Open a buffer window to the right. Look up what I need or make changes to what I need, save the buffer and close it. Get back to where I was. Love the org-capture window which lets me add stuff to other files with a few keyboard commands. Save the additions and move back to the original document. I also like the ability to make a scratch buffer to the right of the document. Comes in handy when I am tweaking my configuration file. Write the elisp in the scratch buffer. Get it working right and move it to the default configuration file.</p>
<h2 id="definitive-use-case">Definitive Use-case</h2>
<p>If you need two or multiple documents open, one to write in, and the others to provide information, I can see the need to have multiple windows accessible and in front of you. I rarely run into this situation. <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/" target="_blank">BBEdit</a> spoiled me with its ability to give me a split view into the same document. I have the outline the top of the document and the text of the document in the second split. I can look up at the outline and know where I am going. That seems a better solution to my use-case than multiple windows. In Emacs, I do the same thing but with two windows. the outline to the right of the frame and the editing area to the left. Performs the same function that BBEdit does.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I see a lot of folks who are euphoric about their window managers and who swear that it is integral to their workflow. I must be missing something. I don’t get it. It is a popular product category, I am in the minority. Apple included the feature in Tahoe. Considering how fucked up Tahoe is, I am not sure that is a ringing endorsement of the feature.</p>
