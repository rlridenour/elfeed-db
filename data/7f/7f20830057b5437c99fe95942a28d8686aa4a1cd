<blockquote>
  <p>With iOS 26, Apple placed two big buttons onscreen when an alarm
went off. One was for stop and the other snooze. That wasn’t a big
deal for many of the alarms you set throughout the day, but when
you’re waking up in the morning blurry-eyed, two big buttons
stacked on top of each other weren’t ideal. For a lot of users, it
was a toss-up whether stabbing at their iPhone through a morning
haze would stop their alarm or snooze it.</p>

<p>With iOS and iPadOS 26.1, the “Stop” button for an alarm set in
the system Clock app now requires a slide to stop gesture, which
echoes the Slide to Unlock gesture of the original iPhone. The
more deliberate gesture is a good move on Apple’s part. I can’t
imagine someone tapping and sliding their finger to stop an alarm
by accident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a clever little change. I enjoy that it harks back to the <a href="https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=955">original iPhone’s slide-to-unlock</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> If, for whatever reason, you don’t like this slide-to-stop feature, you can turn it off by toggling this option in Settings: Accessibility → Touch → Prefer Single-Touch Actions.</p>
