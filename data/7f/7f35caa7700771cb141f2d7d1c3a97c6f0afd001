<p>The US Federal Reserve voted on Wednesday to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a 3.5% to 3.75% range, marking its first pause since July and resisting public pressure from President Donald Trump for additional cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the US economy has continued to show surprising strength and that the outlook has improved since the previous meeting, though he noted consumer spending looks uneven across income groups. The decision matters globally because US rates influence capital flows and currencies, and Le Monde reported the dollar hit its lowest level since 2022 as the Fed held steady. Powell also highlighted a separate institutional issue hanging over the central bank: he called the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision on whether President Trump can fire Fed governor Lisa Cook a potentially pivotal case for the Fed’s independence.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/P5i3QlxZxWAUboYvr49yx9wpyckZJDVhPJwg9UslC_QH_Jn9Hb0s-nHkHllrAmagO1kur6RGo9oSgq3JIlnqLdjIqaCnYHHfXzMHY6Sdaq6f8SFF7B6TO5CLKo0qsp23fN72A8uwtkDeuLz2ybtwExw7zY-89RqUAFPjQvC55SSfD60aEQBVWLrghjh5qqoCjIKARt25z_AMrgtVfExjkaTwhpMajRhTmxmoDBcRmV4w' alt='Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, at a press conference in Washington, January 28, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Longer pause: Powell’s remarks indicated officials could stay on hold until they see either clearer progress toward the 2% inflation goal or new signs of labor-market weakness.</li><li>Leadership clock: Powell said he has not decided whether to remain a Fed governor after his chair term ends in May, a step most Fed chairs have taken after their term ends, according to AP as cited by The Week.</li><li>Succession moves: President Trump is reported to be close to naming the next Fed chair, underscoring how soon leadership could change at the central bank.</li><li>Cook case: The Trump administration is seeking the removal of Fed governor Lisa Cook, an effort tied to the Supreme Court case Powell flagged as historically significant for the institution.</li><li>Powell under probe: WSWS reported Powell declined to address a Trump administration criminal investigation into him during the press conference.</li></ul><blockquote>Don’t get pulled into elected politics.
