<p><em>Updated with the full text of Apple’s statement below.</em></p>
<p>According to a statement <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/12/apple-google-ai-siri-gemini.html">from Apple to CNBC</a>, the company has officially selected Google as the technology partner for its foundation models. News that this deal was in the works had previously been <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/03/apple-may-work-with-google-on-a-i-features/">reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman as far back as March of 2024</a>.</p>
<p>The full implications of this deal aren’t yet known, but it’s likely to affect both Siri as well as other Apple Intelligence features, several of which were first announced in 2024 but have yet to actually ship. Gurman has also previously reported that those delayed Apple Intelligence features are likely to make their debut in iOS 26.4 this spring.</p>
<p>It’s unclear exactly where in the timeframe we are. Given that 26.3 is already in beta, and 26.4 is expected in a few months, it’s possible that work has long since started on this, even if it’s only being officially announced now.<sup id="fnref-38045-cnbc"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-38045-cnbc" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup> Even with the leg-up provided by Google’s models, it seems unlikely the company could simply roll in that tech for a feature due out in short order.</p>
<p>It had previously been thought that Google’s Gemini would be offered as an option via Siri, in the same way that ChatGPT has been available for some time. That was tacitly confirmed by Apple software chief Craig Federighi who said at the company’s 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference, “we may look forward to doing integrations with different models like Google Gemini in the future.” But that deal never materialized—perhaps in part because the two companies were discussing this more substantive deal?</p>
<p>Either way, Google’s models are clearly a step up from Apple’s own endeavors thus far. The two companies also have a longstanding relationship over search in Safari, which makes this perhaps an unsurprising continuation of that. But as to whether it can help Apple dig itself out of the AI hole in which it’s found itself, well, we’ll find out soon enough.</p>
<p>Apple provided Six Colors with the full statement:</p>
<blockquote><p> Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.</p>
<p>After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google’s Al technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple’s industry-leading privacy standards.</p></blockquote>
