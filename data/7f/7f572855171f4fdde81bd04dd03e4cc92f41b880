<p>I typically like my macOS desktop free from distractions, which includes hiding the status bar.</p>
<p>Having said that, I don't want to lose track of time, and for that, I built a tiny ever-present floating clock.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/evertime/main/screenshots/demo.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>While it's been a while since I built this clock, it's only now that I decided to make it available via <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/xenodium/EverTime">EverTime</a> lives in its own <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/EverTime">GitHub repository</a> and can be installed with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">brew install --HEAD xenodium/evertime/evertime
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to using EverTime, I also like enabling &quot;Announce the time&quot; under macOS System Settings, which announces the time every hour.</p>
