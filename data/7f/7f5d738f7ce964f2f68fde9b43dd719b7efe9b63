Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538">reiterated</a> that a more affordable MacBook powered by an iPhone processor is slated to enter mass production in the fourth quarter of 2025, which points towards a late 2025 or early 2026 launch.<br/>

Below, we recap the rumors about the lower-priced MacBook so far.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">first to reveal</a> that Apple is allegedly planning a more affordable MacBook. In late June, he said the laptop would have around a 13-inch display, and an A18 Pro chip. Kuo said potential color options include silver, blue, pink, and yellow, so the laptop could come in bright colors, like 2021-and-newer models of the 24-inch iMac.<br/>
<br/>
This time around, he only mentioned the MacBook will have an unspecific iPhone processor. Apple recently introduced the A19 Pro chip, which has 12GB of RAM, so it will be interesting to see if the lower-cost MacBook uses that chip instead. The entire Mac lineup has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/entire-mac-lineup-now-at-least-16gb-ram/">started with at least 16GB of RAM</a> since last year, with the only option with 8GB being the MacBook with an M1 chip, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-599-at-walmart/">sold exclusively by Walmart for &#36;599</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The A18 Pro offers similar performance as the M1 chip, so Apple might opt to save the A19 Pro for the second-generation lower-cost MacBook. Kuo anticipates that follow-up model will be released in 2027, with specs still not finalized.<br/>
<br/>
Taiwanese supply chain publication <em>DigiTimes</em> expects the laptop to have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/new-12-9-inch-macbook-launch-this-year-599-price/">starting price of between &#36;599 and &#36;699</a> in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The publication said the lower-cost MacBook will be equipped with a 12.9-inch display, and a version of the A18 Pro chip that debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro models last year. It would become the first Mac to ever use an A-series chip from an iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
The lower-cost MacBook could launch in late 2025 or early 2026, that report said.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, the A18 Pro and A19 Pro lack Thunderbolt support, so the MacBook would likely be equipped with regular USB-C ports. They would look the same as Thunderbolt ports, but data transfer speeds would be limited to up to 10 Gbps. The laptop would natively support only a single external display, but that limitation can be overcome with DisplayLink adapters.<br/>
<br/>
The lower-cost MacBook could have a lot in common with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/12-inch-macbook-introduced-10-years-ago/">discontinued 12-inch MacBook</a>, including an ultra-thin and lightweight design. It would slot in below the MacBook Air, which has a slightly larger 13.6-inch display, an M4 chip, and a starting price of &#36;999. However, the latest MacBook Air is sometimes on sale on Amazon <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/16/low-prices-m4-macbook-air/">for as low as &#36;799</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple often announces new Macs in October, so perhaps the lower-cost MacBook will debut next month. Otherwise, March 2026 is the next likely timeframe.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-a18-pro/">MacBook (A18 Pro)</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/macbook-with-iphone-chip-production-rumor/">&#36;599 MacBook With iPhone Chip Expected to Enter Production This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/599-macbook-with-iphone-chip-expected-to-enter-production-this-year.2466210/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
