I&rsquo;ve been following <a href="https://sachachua.com">Sacha Chua</a> for a long time. I think I started while she was still at University but it was certainly shortly afterwards at the latest. She&rsquo;s been at it for about 25 years so it&rsquo;s hard for me to remember. During that time I&rsquo;ve had her in my RSS/Atom feed and read her posts in various feed readers.

These days, of course, I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">Elfeed</a> but she still pops up regularly in my feed. The other day, I was reading her post on <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/12/j-apprecie-les-gens-d-emacs-i-appreciate-the-people-of-emacs/">Emacs People</a> for the latest Emacs Carnival and I noticed that she wrote in both French and English. That seemed new so I poked around a bit a discovered that it&rsquo;s another of her ongoing projects, just like my learning Spanish<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>. The thing is, I had never seen any other posts in or about French from her. Then I realized that all the posts I&rsquo;ve been seeing from her were actually coming from <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>. What was going on? I checked and, sure enough, her blog was in my feed list. After fiddling around for a bit I tried following the link I had for her in my feed and got a 404 but I had no problem finding the feed directly from her site. I checked it against what her site had and it seemed the same. Then I noticed that on the 404 page there was a <code>%20</code> at the end of the URL. Aha! There was a space at the end of the URL I was using. I wouldn&rsquo;t think that would matter but when I removed it, things started working again.
</p>
<p>
So the moral of this long story is that if you&rsquo;re having trouble getting the RSS/Atom entries from some site, check to be sure you don&rsquo;t have a space at the end of the URL. It&rsquo;s easy to see how it could happen even if you know what you&rsquo;re doing, and once made, it&rsquo;s hard to see with a casual glance at things.

Anyway, I&rsquo;m back to getting all Sacha&rsquo;s posts now. Too bad that I don&rsquo;t remember a lot of the French I learned as a result of one of those annoying foreign language requirements in graduate school.

Except that I&rsquo;m not brave enough to try writing a post in Spanish.
