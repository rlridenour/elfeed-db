<p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance is set to meet in Washington on Wednesday with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland, alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, amid rising tensions over President Trump’s repeated insistence that the United States will gain control of Greenland. Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, publicly rejected the idea ahead of the meeting, saying Greenland would choose Denmark (and aligning with NATO and the EU) rather than the United States. The dispute has raised concerns among European officials and analysts about strain on NATO and Arctic security as diplomats seek an off-ramp through negotiations rather than escalation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7QO6hCv2-XK4181yjIlRyX489GjaXu3mS0X_-wdPzX6irO4UBvNbaNCMulwsS_FYN0YNFZXBbbCyOobu6_YNPBXbyDRA0cjuBqUPwcbKoUWLX7b11Ry38pARYwNqywyB1weuzlXuA_YPROOloTVzd0QzeizREI12ekBrdKl35K5HCw7iuT3UKM4CS16g9YqLhBh7ag' alt='Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen of Greenland and Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark in Copenhagen on Tuesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Congress pushback: In the U.S. Congress, Arctic-focused lawmakers planned a closed-door meeting with Denmark’s ambassador, and Sen.
