<p id="p2"><a href="https://proxyman.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proxyman</a>&nbsp;is the native, high-performance debugging proxy that makes monitoring and analyzing your app&rsquo;s network stack almost effortless. Built with Swift and Apple Silicon in mind, it runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux, so every member of your team can peek under the hood without wrestling with legacy-era UIs.</p>

<p id="p4">Proxyman&rsquo;s toolkit goes far beyond simple packet capture. Breakpoints pause requests, so you can tweak headers or bodies on the fly; Map Local and Map Remote let you swap in local files or redirect traffic to staging servers; scripting, diffing, network throttling, and WebSocket support round out a workspace that replaces what was a whole folder full of utilities.</p>
