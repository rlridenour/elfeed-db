iOS 26 allows users to set custom backgrounds in conversations, and it introduces the ability to create polls.<br/>
<br/>
In the Messages app, users can now screen messages from unknown senders. Apple says messages from unknown senders will appear in a dedicated folder, where users can mark the phone number as known, ask for more information, or delete it. These messages will remain silenced until a user accepts them.<br/>
