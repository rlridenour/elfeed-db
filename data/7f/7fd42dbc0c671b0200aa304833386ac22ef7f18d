<p>Some “<em>thank god some of you remembered because I thought I was going nuts</em>” follow-up regarding my remembrance the other day, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/05/15_years_later_very_insightful_and_not_negative">15 Years Later: ‘Very Insightful and Not Negative’</a>”. I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, what would <em>you</em> do if Steve Jobs was quoted in a viral blog
post saying, “We think «<em>Your Name Here</em>»’s post is very
insightful and not negative”? I decided to just sit there with a
smug look on my face for a few days (which, arguably, isn’t all
that different from what I do most days) and pretend that it was
no big deal. I didn’t link to it or mention it on Daring Fireball,
and as far as I can tell, <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%22not%20negative%22%20(from%3Agruber)&amp;src=typed_query">I didn’t even tweet it</a>. As best I
can recall, I thought I should just play it cool. I mean of course
my article about why Apple changed Section 3.3.1 was right. Why
brag? Given that Steve Jobs was reading Daring Fireball, I didn’t
want him to read a post from me acting like it was a big deal that
he’d recommended a piece I wrote and agreed with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About a dozen long-time readers recalled that I <em>did</em>, in fact, acknowledge it on Daring Fireball — and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114523770015232774">as soon as I saw</a> the first message, it all came back to me. I never linked to the viral blog post where Jobs was quoted recommending my article. I never mentioned it in a post. But I <em>did</em> acknowledge it, in what is clearly the most Daring-Fireball-ish way possible: I made it the slogan under the logo banner. That it was only ever a slogan in a PNG logo graphic explains why I couldn’t find it by searching. And I still have that version of the logo (because I keep everything):</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img
    src = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/df_logo_insightful_not_negative_2010.png"
    alt = "The 2010 DF logo with the slogan “Insightful and Not Negative” underneath in small type."
    style = "background-color: #4a525a; margin-bottom: 1em;"
  />
</div>

<p>I can’t remember if I omitted the <em>very</em> before <em>insightful</em> for aesthetic length, humility, or because I somehow thought it was punchier. But my 2025 self thinks it was a mistake to omit it. It surely looks blurry on your screen today, because it’s a 1× graphic scaled to the correct size. In April 2010, 2× retina resolution wasn’t yet a thing — remember, that was the very month that Gizmodo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkK7_QEIJrg" title="Jon Prosser’s documentary: “The Biggest Apple Leak in History”">published details regarding a stolen iPhone 4 prototype</a>, which was the device that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq8j5vsqCCo" title="Steve Jobs introducing and defining the retina display at WWDC 2010.">introduced “retina resolution” to the world</a>. At 50 percent, you can see it pixel-perfect (the slogan is rendered in <a href="https://kare.com/fonts/">Susan Kare’s exquisite Kare Five Dots</a> pixel font), but small:</p>

<div style="text-align: center">

    srcset = "https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/df_logo_insightful_not_negative_2010.png 2x"
    alt = "The 2010 DF logo with the slogan “Insightful and Not Negative” underneath in small type. Rendered at half-size to remain pixel-perfect on modern 2× retina resolution displays."
    style = "background-color: #4a525a; margin-bottom: 1em;"
  />
</div>

<p>In the very early days, there was always a slogan under the DF logo. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/design/1/">Originally</a>: “Mac Punditry and Curmudgeonry”. Then, for several years, I’d mix it up, with descriptive slogans like “Mac + Web Nerdery, Etc.”, but also with ones that were just there for fun: “Now With Retsyn”, “Simple Tricks and Nonsense”, and, during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBWg93q9qBA">2008 World Series</a>, “Phillies Fever”. But for the last decade or so, I’ve left the logo banner slogan-less most weeks of the year.</p>

<p>Feels like the right time to bring back a little whimsy, so I’ve put “Very Insightful and Not Negative” back as the slogan for now, and I’m thinking I should keep occasionally having some fun up there.</p>
