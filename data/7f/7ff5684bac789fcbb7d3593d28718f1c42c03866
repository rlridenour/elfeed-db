<p>Australian police have charged four men from Sydney’s inner suburbs over an alleged online network that shared child sexual abuse material with satanic and ritualistic themes, following a months-long investigation into an international abuse ring. The men, aged between their 20s and 60s, were arrested in separate raids across the city, where officers seized electronic devices, hard drives and other digital evidence for forensic examination. Investigators say the group allegedly used an internationally administered website to possess, distribute and facilitate access to graphic material involving children, and believe this local network formed part of a wider global operation already under scrutiny by specialist child exploitation teams. Police emphasised that they have not identified any offending involving children in the men’s direct care in Australia at this stage, and highlighted the arrests as evidence that international collaboration and cyber capabilities can successfully disrupt hidden online abuse networks.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/cslLvjp1Qe5EAUnRywmAkb7x-HotsE6cdGxk2914ea6HwLGVhsMUG6O5ec_-WroYBXgsXMdn-dmFj1fwXd8IlxiTtThAGBTOJ5ki7f3bHjiOrAtxsb16AVZ20rnYzFCzqffDgPSfhoFsZCM' alt='Australian and state police say a months-long investigation led to the arrest of four men in Sydney over an alleged online child abuse network.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Arrests across suburbs: The four suspects were detained during coordinated police operations in Waterloo, Ashfield, Croydon Park and Riverwood after detectives linked them to the same online network.</li><li>Range of charges: The men face multiple counts including possessing, transmitting and producing child abuse material, using a carriage service for child abuse material, and bestiality-related offences in at least one case.</li><li>Specialist taskforce role: New South Wales Police’s child exploitation squad, working with the Australian Federal Police, led the operation as part of an ongoing probe into an international &quot;satanic&quot; child abuse material ring.</li><li>Forensic examination: Seized computers, phones and storage devices have been sent for detailed forensic analysis, and police expect further investigative leads to emerge from recovered data.</li><li>Potential further arrests: Investigators indicated inquiries are continuing both in Australia and overseas, raising the possibility that additional suspects could be identified as the broader network is mapped.</li></ul><blockquote>The arrests today demonstrate our commitment to targeting individuals involved in the most abhorrent crimes against children, no matter where they try to hide online - Detective Superintendent Chris Goddard</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>New South Wales Police: NSW Police said the four Sydney men were allegedly part of a network that shared child sexual abuse material with ritualistic and satanic themes via an internationally administered website, and described the case as part of a wider global investigation into online child exploitation.
