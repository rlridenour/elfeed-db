<blockquote>
  <p>Google must hand over its search results and some data to rival
companies but does not need to break itself up by selling its
Chrome web browser, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday. The
decision, by Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia, falls short of the sweeping changes
proposed by the government to rein in the power of Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Judge Mehta said in the 223-page ruling that Google must share
some of its search data with “qualified competitors” to resolve
its monopoly. The Justice Department had asked the judge to force
the company to share even more of its data, arguing it was key to
Google’s dominance.</p>

<p>Judge Mehta also put restrictions on payments that Google uses to
ensure its search engine gets prime placement in web browsers and
on smartphones. But he stopped short of banning those payments
entirely and did not grant the government’s request that Google be
forced to sell Chrome, which the government said was necessary to
remedy the company’s power as a search monopoly.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding this power, courts must approach the task of
crafting remedies with a healthy dose of humility,” Judge Mehta
said in Tuesday’s decision. “This court has done so.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No forced divestiture of Chrome or Android, and Google is allowed to continue making traffic acquisition cost payments to companies like Apple (for search in Safari) and Mozilla (for search in Firefox). The decision seems very reasonable to me. And while <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1436.0_4.pdf">the entire ruling</a> is 223 pages, Judge Mehta included a good summary at the front. You can get a feel for it just by reading the first few pages.</p>
