The long wait for an Apple Watch Ultra 3 appears to be nearly over, and it is rumored to feature both satellite connectivity and 5G support.<br/>

In his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-29/apple-should-launch-oura-ring-competitor-tethered-vision-pro-ios-26-beta-2-mchmc20h"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is on track to launch this year with "significant" new features, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/2025-apple-watch-ultra-5g-satellite-texting/">satellite connectivity</a>, which would let you send text messages when Wi-Fi and cellular coverage is unavailable. This feature will work without an iPhone, he said.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman also expects the Apple Watch Ultra 3 to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/2025-apple-watch-ultra-5g-satellite-texting/">support a special version of 5G</a> for smartwatches. The existing Ultra models support LTE.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 received a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-watch-ultra-satin-black-milanese-loop/">black titanium case option</a>, but otherwise the Ultra model has not received any hardware upgrades since 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/25/6-apple-watch-ultra-3-features/">likely upgrades</a> for the Apple Watch Ultra 3 include an S10 chip or newer, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that is brighter when viewed from an angle and offers a higher refresh rate for the always-on display mode. All of these improvements were already introduced on the Apple Watch Series 10 last year.<br/>
<br/>
In March, Gurman said Apple was still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/apple-watch-blood-pressure-feature-snags/">experiencing issues</a> with a planned blood pressure monitoring feature for the Apple Watch, so it is unclear if that will be ready in time for the Ultra 3, which should launch in a little over two months from now.<br/>
