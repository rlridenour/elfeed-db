<li><strong>Vanilla.</strong> Someone decided. Good. No further questions. We can make progress now.</li>
<li><strong>Educated</strong>. You ask why they decided, and they can clearly explain their reasoning. Not everyone might appreciate the decision, but they will be given the opportunity to understand.<sup id="fnref-5395-1"><a href="#fn-5395-1" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Calculated.</strong> Not only can they explain the decision, but they have math! Wow, I&#8217;m super convinced now. </li>
<li><strong>Instinct</strong>. They attempt to explain their reasoning, but they say &#8220;feel&#8221; a lot. A lot. Thing is, it feels right, so you don&#8217;t press.</li>
<li><strong>Inspired</strong>. Now you press, and they can tell you want a clear rationale and justification, but none obviously exists. This decision is not meant to be understood; it&#8217;s meant to be appreciated for its poetry. It is 100% expected that inspired decisions are going to frustrate those seeking clarity; they are going to point at the lack of a clear explanation. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know what the hell he&#8217;s doing. It&#8217;s a guess.&#8221; It might be a guess, but it also might be art in the making.<sup id="fnref-5395-2"><a href="#fn-5395-2" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref-5395-3"><a href="#fn-5395-3" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">3</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Minimum Viable.</strong> My least favorite. Your investigation into their justification reveals that they chose a decision that was not designed to be good; it was constructed to offend the fewest humans. This is not leadership — it&#8217;s fear. </li>
<li><strong>Delegated</strong>. Rather than doing the minimal work of even making a minimum viable decision, they gave the decision to someone else because — and I quote — &#8220;They are more capable of making this decision.&#8221; What they are actually saying is, &#8220;I would prefer that this human deal with the weight and consequences for this decision.&#8221; The good news: at least you got a decision. </li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, they don&#8217;t decide. You push, you prod, but they won&#8217;t decide. No, they didn&#8217;t delegate, no, they didn&#8217;t wing it, they just waited and waited… kind&#8217;a maybe hoping the need for this decision would vanish. Technically, deciding not to decide is a decision, and that&#8217;s a choice, but it&#8217;s not leadership.</p>

Context is what matters when understanding a decision. Who is making it? Why now? How have they decided in the past? What happened as a result of these decisions? Are they being forced to decide? Is someone demanding they decide? I could write another ten questions to help you understand the essential context surrounding this decision, but I&#8217;d miss a question essential to this specific decision. My only advice: be painfully curious when it comes to decisions. Yes, this is the introduction to this piece tucked into a footnote.
