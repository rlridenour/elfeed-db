Just as Google Calendar makes it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/google-launches-calendar-app-for-apple-watch/">debut on the Apple Watch</a>, the Google Keep app for Apple Watch has been discontinued.<br/>

Google Keep is a free note-taking service offered by Google. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-keep-notes-and-lists/id1029207872">Version 2.2025.26200</a> of Google Keep removes the watchOS app, with no other noticeable changes to the app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. Google Keep for Wear OS continues to be available. <br/>
<br/>
Google Keep for Apple Watch had not been updated meaningfully for many years, with no support for many basic platform features such as complications. Meanwhile, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a>, Apple is bringing its own native Notes app to the Apple Watch for the first time. <br/>

Yesterday, Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/google-launches-calendar-app-for-apple-watch/">released a Calendar app for the Apple Watch</a>, bringing its native calendar and task functionality to watchOS for the first time. Now, only Google Maps, YouTube Music, and Google Calendar have dedicated watchOS apps.<br/>
