<p>French authorities have taken the captain of the oil tanker Grinch into custody for questioning after the French navy intercepted the vessel in the Mediterranean and diverted it to a guarded port area near Marseille. Prosecutors said the ship raised suspicions by failing to fly a flag, and investigators are examining whether it is linked to Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet” used to move oil in ways that can bypass sanctions. The crew members, reported as Indian nationals, have remained with the vessel as checks continue, underscoring how enforcement actions can affect multinational seafarers even when the investigation targets broader sanctions-evasion networks.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/y_fPBwL2xHVTCF8nYucd-cZ4HyXwcps-ZxQZZytFIUMPPOSkHHaIeuWHQA8_4ac49LwNk9kY6C6KQvMSHEBnyBHFiz4ydnHNjBNE5j5LK_g3nxBdVw3G1Y3Dkfz2WN1dj4BS1R0PLAGXv-XAUfMVy7hcVhS4aq6KBAAcMo3S9Zj-zjWGZxlPdtXkVK9OhPCkDDVs_rKdjSr2JiEvS56MiZMuJFkB4_oJOddPl3DiVkOd-4tWTK3frwXamveXYqEHukTWQC622g' alt='French navy boats surround the Grinch oil tanker in the Gulf of Fos-sur-Mer, near Marseille, January 25, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Custody status: Marseille prosecutors said the 58-year-old captain is being questioned while the ship is held under guard near the Fos-sur-Mer/Marseille area.</li><li>Crew arrangements: Other crew members remained on board as authorities worked to verify the vessel’s flag documentation and status.</li><li>Ship identity: Multiple outlets identified the intercepted tanker as the Grinch, described as a suspected member of a sanctions-busting “shadow fleet”.</li><li>Enforcement signal: The seizure highlights increased scrutiny of ships that obscure ownership or registration, a practice associated in the reports with efforts to keep Russian oil flowing despite sanctions.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Marseille prosecutors’ office: Investigators detained the captain for questioning and are examining the vessel’s missing/unclear flag status as part of the case.
