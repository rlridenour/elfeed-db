<p>The United States Interior Department has announced that non‑US residents will face significantly higher entrance fees at some of the country’s most visited national parks starting in 2026, as part of a new &quot;America‑first&quot; pricing policy backed by President Trump’s administration. Foreign tourists without an annual pass will pay a new $100 charge on top of the regular per‑park entrance fee at 11 flagship sites such as Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, while US residents continue under the existing fee structure. The government will also introduce a redesigned “America the Beautiful” annual pass featuring President Trump, priced at $80 for residents and $250 for non‑residents under an &quot;America‑first&quot; tiered system. Officials say the extra revenue will support park operations and conservation as the National Park Service faces possible budget cuts next year, while critics question whether the higher prices could reduce access for international visitors and strain already‑defunded conservation partners.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/zdA45l29d-QA5VMZ66ARwn6xquk8NnKGcXKtpflbMyHie9L08lbYMSJfZ0Ee5ojJD0UqPqsbSr1F4k9MopP0_8wRgG-74vFzfyIy1J6qQiK11j1Xo1o2AuMTvQW-dJ1SIhHFBzAUsK0yqRQs_ntC2NC-NmQoSWEM_o1zPobV2PxFO5qKNB58eT_0fsOBfzlKYk_tJ-EgWuQDHqTpMt9axKn9x1Lzie3JN0n-kLwmETYl3y2ulz8HsyUnBKMXXrx9ZkUB46T6PwTgqLGHIyLoxNVuig' alt='Visitors walk near geothermal features in Yellowstone National Park, one of several US parks that will introduce higher fees for foreign tourists.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scope of parks: The new international surcharge will apply to 11 of the most popular US national parks, including Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Zion, Rocky Mountain and others that together receive tens of millions of visits annually.</li><li>Resident incentives: Alongside higher fees for foreigners, the Interior Department plans special &quot;resident‑only patriotic fee‑free days&quot; in 2026, including on President Trump’s birthday, allowing US residents to enter participating parks without paying entrance charges on those days.</li><li>Trump‑branded passes: The redesigned annual &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; pass will feature commemorative imagery of President Trump, turning a routine access card into a political souvenir marketed under the government’s &quot;America‑first&quot; language.</li><li>Conservation narrative: Interior officials frame the fee increases as a way to raise money for conservation and maintenance at a time when the department has cut funding for some external conservation organizations that traditionally supported park projects.</li><li>Implementation timing: While the international surcharge is due to begin in 2026, the new pricing schedule and commemorative passes are being announced in late 2025 so tour operators and travelers can adjust their plans for upcoming seasons.</li></ul><blockquote>&quot;Americans shouldn&#x27;t be subsidising wealthy foreign tourists who visit our parks.&quot; - Unnamed Trump administration official (as reported)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Interior Department: The department presents the higher charges on non‑residents as a tool to generate additional revenue for conservation and park upkeep while prioritising access and special free‑entry days for US residents.
