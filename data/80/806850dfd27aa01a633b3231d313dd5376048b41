<p>I was recently reading a post about deleting files from within emacs and pushing them to the local Trash, this seems like a good idea especially now I am using dired more often.</p>

<p>After using <code>describe-function</code> and typing <strong><em>trash</em></strong> there was a single completion, namely <code>move-file-to-trash</code> from this I figured out I should add the following my .emacs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(setq trash-directory <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;~/.local/share/Trash/files&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(setq delete-by-moving-to-trash <span style="color:#66d9ef">t</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I am running this on OpenSuse so the location of the Trash folder may vary from system to system.</p>
<p>For a more bespoke copying mechanism there is potentially the ability to define system-move-file-to-trash accepting <strong><em>file</em></strong> as an argument, but currently I don&rsquo;t need anything to be that sophisticated.</p>
