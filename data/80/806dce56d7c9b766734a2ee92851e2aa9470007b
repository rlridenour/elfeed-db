<p>Apple says the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unleashes-m5-the-next-big-leap-in-ai-performance-for-apple-silicon/">M5</a>&nbsp;delivers 4X the peak GPU compute for AI compared to the M4. Most tech sites reported the number and moved on. I don&#8217;t think people have fully grasped what this means for running AI locally.</p>



<p>The gain isn&#8217;t just faster cores. Apple put a Neural Accelerator in every GPU core. I&#8217;ve been running local models through&nbsp;<a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/exploring-llms-mlx-m5">MLX</a>&nbsp;on my M2 Mac for a while now, but barely. The M5 turns local AI from &#8220;it works, I guess&#8221; into something that feels responsive.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a timing angle here too. NAND and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/the-ram-pricing-crisis-has-only-just-started-team-group-gm-warns-says-problem-will-get-worse-in-2026-as-dram-and-nand-prices-double-in-one-month">memory prices jumped 55-60% in Q1 2026</a>, and the industry expects them to keep climbing. If you want a Mac with serious memory for local AI work, buying now might save you real money over waiting for the M6 or M7. Future machines could carry a much higher price tag for the same RAM.</p>



<p>I look at these numbers, and then I look at my M2 Mac Studio, and I&#8217;m raising an eyebrow. The M2 was great when I bought it. But 4X faster prompt processing with purpose-built AI hardware? That&#8217;s the kind of gap that makes you start browsing the Apple Store at midnight.</p>



<p>If you have zero interest in local AI, the M5 is just another chip upgrade. But if you&#8217;re running models, experimenting with MLX, or thinking about it, this is the first Mac where Apple clearly built the GPU around AI. And with memory prices headed where they&#8217;re headed, the window to get in at current pricing might not stay open.</p>
