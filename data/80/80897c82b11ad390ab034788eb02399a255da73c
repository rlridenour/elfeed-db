<blockquote>
  <p>If we hold things to this list, programs like Nova, MarsEdit, and
Apple Pages — canonical Mac-assed Mac apps — all do
unsurprisingly smashingly. But Obsidian, the Electron-based
program I’m writing in right now, does shockingly well, too.
Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code doesn’t do quite as well (most
notably, it opens its settings “window” as an editor tab), but it
does better than Sublime Text (which opens a text file for
settings), and much better than the banana crazypants menu and
icon design of the cross-platform e-book management program
Calibre.</p>

<p>Martin has a good list here of fundamentals, but ultimately, you know it when you see it.</p>
