<blockquote>
  <p>Google has updated its affiliate ads policy for Chrome extensions
after creators accused PayPal’s popular Honey browser extension of
being a “scam.”</p>

<p>Honey <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/23/24328268/honey-coupon-code-browser-extension-scam-influencers-affiliate-marketing">was accused</a> of taking affiliate revenue from the same
influencers it paid for promotion by using its Chrome extension to
swap in its own affiliate link before you checked out. According
to the updated Google policy <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/affiliate-ads">posted today</a>, this isn’t
allowed in most cases</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t say they were merely accused — they were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4yL3YTwWk">caught, red-handed</a>.</p>
