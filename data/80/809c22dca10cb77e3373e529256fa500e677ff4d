<blockquote>
  <p>To start a group chat tap the people icon in the top right corner
of any new or existing chat. When you add someone to an existing
chat, ChatGPT creates a copy of your conversation as a new group
chat so your original conversation stays separate. You can invite
others directly by sharing a link with one to twenty people, and
anyone in the group can share that link to bring others in. When
you join or create your first group chat, you’ll be asked to set
up a short profile with your name, username, and photo so everyone
knows who’s in the conversation. Group chats can be found in a new
clearly-labeled section of the sidebar for easy access. [...]</p>

<p>Group chats are separate from your private conversations. Your
personal ChatGPT memory is not used in group chats, and ChatGPT
does not create new memories from these conversations. We’re
exploring offering more granular controls in the future so you can
choose if and how ChatGPT uses memory with group chats.</p>

<p>Currently rolling out in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan. [<strong>Update:</strong> Expanded worldwide <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/21/group-chats-chatgpt-worldwide">just three days later</a>.]  Rate limits and advanced model usage depend on the group member to whom ChatGPT replies. Pretty clever, and I can imaging a lot of ways this would be useful, both for family/friends and for work collaboration. I like the idea that this is built into ChatGPT, not an AI bot in a regular messaging app. This way, you <em>know</em> with certainty which of your chats are being seen and read by an AI bot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve also taught ChatGPT new social behaviors for group chats. It
follows the flow of the conversation and decides when to respond
and when to stay quiet based on the context of the group
conversation. You can always mention “ChatGPT” in a message when
you want it to respond. We’ve also given ChatGPT the ability to
react to messages with emojis, and reference profile photos — so
it can, for example, use group members’ photos when asked to
create fun personalized images within that group conversation.</p>

<p>This is a really hard problem to solve. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/wavelength">Wavelength</a>, the late <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/a_bit_of_follow-up_on_wavelength">great</a> private group messaging app whose team I advised from 2023 to 2024 (when the app shuttered), added AI chatbots (with customizable personalities) in June 2023. Wavelength’s AI bots only responded when mentioned explicitly.</p>
