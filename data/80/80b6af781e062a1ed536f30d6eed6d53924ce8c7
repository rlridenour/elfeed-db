<p>In English, most of the words we’d use to refer to insects sound off-putting at best and fearsome at worst, at least to those without an entomological bent. Dutch, close a linguistic relation though it may be, offers a more endearing alternative in <em>beestjes</em>, which refers to all these “little beasts” in which the artists and scientists of Europe started to take a major interest in the late sixteenth century. As was the style of that era, the magisteria of art and science tended to overlap, a phenomenon nowhere more clearly reflected — at least with regard to the insect kingdom — than in the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joris_Hoefnagel">Joris Hoefnagel</a>, a Flemish artist whose illustrations of <em>beestjes</em> combined beauty and accuracy in a manner never seen before.</p>

You can now see Hoefnagel’s art up close at the exhibition <a href="https://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/little-beasts-art-wonder-and-natural-world"><em>Little Beasts: Art, Wonder, and the Natural World</em></a>, which will be up at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC until early November. If you won’t be able to make it out to the museum, have a look at <a href="https://www.nga.gov/stories/articles/marvelous-details-joris-hoefnagels-animal-and-insect-studies">the exhibition’s web site</a>, which shows off the splendor of Hoefnagel’s work as published in <em>The Four Elements</em>, a collection of about 300 watercolors grouped into four volumes in the fifteen-seventies and eighties, each one named for an element: <em>Aqua</em> contains water animals; <em>Terra</em> land animals; <em>Aier</em> birds and plants; and <em>Ignis</em>, or “fire,” insects.</p>

<p>“We don’t really know why Hoefnagel put insects in the fire volume,” says Evan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Nerdwriter1">“Nerdwriter”</a> Puschak in <a href="https://youtu.be/2Tn6xnOnBFI">the new video above</a>. “Maybe because both fire and insects symbolize transformation.”</p>

“What we do know,” Puschak adds, “is that these insect miniatures are magnificently rendered.” Hoefnagel even made improvements on the nature illustrations of his artistic predecessor <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2013/07/the_genius_of_albrecht_durer_revealed_in_four_self-portraits.html">Albrecht Dürer</a>, whose own abilities to render our world with fidelity had been regarded as nearly superhuman. One particular work that surpasses Dürer is Hoefnagel’s depiction of a stag beetle, which he accompanied with the Latin inscription “SCARABEI UMBRA,” or “the shadow of the stag beetle”: possibly a reference to the unprecedented realism of the insect’s shadow as Hoefnagel rendered it, but in any case a common saying at the time about hollow threats. For however frightening the stag beetle looked, as Hoefnagel well knew, the actual creature was gentle — just another wee beastie after all.</p>
