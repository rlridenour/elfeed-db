<p>The United States has approved multibillion-dollar weapons sales to Israel and Saudi Arabia, with the Trump administration notifying Congress as regional tensions with Iran remain high. The packages include a sale to Israel featuring 30 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and other equipment, alongside a separate sale to Saudi Arabia for Patriot air-defense missiles intended to counter incoming attacks. Officials framed the moves as support for partners’ security and deterrence, while the reporting notes the decision comes as a fragile ceasefire is in place in Gaza and amid broader uncertainty over potential US military action involving Iran. Supporters emphasize defensive and readiness benefits; critics highlight how the systems could be used in ongoing conflicts, underscoring how arms transfers can shape both deterrence and humanitarian risk.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/oV5eQG81iLqQHoJnVdxuca2mgLlA2ZPFtEcPGaE8_ZyThydnRIF-HcH5BKalvu_LFqRllWyFA4HJ8HbID6QViGcJlF3vE4pjElpzgYV35Bxn' alt='A US Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopter prepares to support Operation Hawkeye Strike, Dec. 19, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Israel package: Israel’s approved package includes an estimated $1.8 billion for joint light tactical vehicles, alongside aviation-related items.</li><li>Saudi air defense: Saudi Arabia’s request covers 730 Patriot missiles, described as systems used to defend against incoming attacks.</li><li>Aid vs sales: The coverage notes the US sends Israel billions of dollars in military supplies each year, with much of that support provided as aid rather than commercial sales.</li><li>Major ally status: President Donald Trump previously designated Saudi Arabia a “major, non-Nato ally,” a status the report says can provide military and economic privileges.</li><li>Ceasefire context: Reporting links the approvals to a Gaza ceasefire reached in October that largely paused two years of war, while describing US-backed efforts focused on next steps such as disarming Hamas.</li></ul><blockquote>The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability, - US State Department</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US State Department: The department said the proposed Israel sale supports US national interests by helping Israel maintain a strong self-defense capability, and announced approvals after notifying Congress.
