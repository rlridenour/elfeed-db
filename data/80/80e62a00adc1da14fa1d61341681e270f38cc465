Apple overhauled the Shortcuts app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe, and there are now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> options that users can take advantage of. The app supports &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; models for things like summarizing PDFs, generating recipes, answering questions, and more.<br/>

As the last pre-made Shortcut suggests, you can create your own shortcuts that incorporate Apple's AI model, and Apple's offerings serve as examples.<br/>
<br/>
When you go to create a Shortcut, there's a new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; section. You can opt to use an on-device model, a cloud model that takes advantage of Private Cloud Compute, or ChatGPT. There are some pre-determined options, so you can do things like open <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a> or generate an image with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>.<br/>

There are several Writing Tools features for adjusting the tone of text, proofreading, creating a list from text, summarizing text, or rewriting text.<br/>
<br/>
When you tap on Cloud, On-Device Model, or ChatGPT, there's an open-ended prompt where you can write in what you want to do. You need to work within the confines of the model that Apple provides, pairing it with other functionality in Shortcuts. You can pull in data from the Weather app, your Calendar, and Reminders, then ask the model to prepare a summary, for example. AI models can be incorporated into any Shortcut. <br/>
