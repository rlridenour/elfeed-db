Pixelmator Pro is a popular image editing app that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-completes-pixelmator-acquisition/">acquired by Apple last year</a>. There is already a more basic <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id924695435">Pixelmator</a> app available for the iPad and iPhone, and now the full-fledged Pixelmator Pro experience is coming to the iPad.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says Pixelmator Pro for iPad will be compatible with iPad models equipped with the A16, A17 Pro, or M1 chip or later on iPadOS 26 or later.<br/>

Here are some of the Pixelmator Pro for iPad features highlighted by Apple:<ul><li>A full-featured Layers sidebar allows creators to use images, shapes, text, and video</li><br/>
<li>Smart selection tools for isolating and editing specific parts of images</li><br/>
<li>Advanced bitmap and vector masks</li><br/>
<li>Super Resolution for intelligently upscaling photos</li><br/>
<li>Deband for removing compression artifacts</li><br/>
<li>Auto Crop with automatic composition suggestions</li><br/>
<li>Apple Pencil support for pressure-sensitive brushing, plus hover, squeeze, and double tap</li></ul>Pixelmator Pro for both iPad and Mac will be available through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/apple-creator-studio/">the new Apple Creator Studio subscription bundle</a>, which in the U.S. costs &#36;12.99 per month or &#36;129 per year. A one-time &#36;49.99 purchase option will remain available, and this will presumably extend to the iPad app. Some new AI features and content in Pixelmator Pro for iPad will only be available with an Apple Creator Studio subscription.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in both the iPad and Mac apps, Apple Creator Studio subscribers will get access to a new Warp tool for twisting and shaping image layers.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-creator-studio/">Apple Creator Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pixelmator/">Pixelmator</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/pixelmator-pro-is-coming-to-ipad/">Pixelmator Pro is Coming to iPad With Apple Pencil Support and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pixelmator-pro-is-coming-to-ipad-with-apple-pencil-support-and-more.2475979/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
