Apple and OpenAI were not able to get a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk's xAI startup dismissed, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/openai-apple-lose-bid-to-toss-musk-xai-suit-over-competition">Bloomberg</a></em>. Texas District Judge Mark Pittman said today that Apple and OpenAI will need to continue on with the lawsuit and submit filings arguing their case.<br/>

xAI sued Apple and OpenAI <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/25/elon-musk-apple-lawsuit-grok-x/">in August 2025</a>, accusing the two companies of conspiring to dominate the AI market. The lawsuit came after Musk complained that his apps X and Grok <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/musk-threatens-sue-apple-grok-app-store-rankings/">had not been featured</a> in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>'s "Must Have" apps section.<br/>
<br/>
The lawsuit claimed that Apple was "blindsided by major innovations in AI," leading it to team up with OpenAI in a "desperate bid to protect its smartphone monopoly." It referenced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>'s ChatGPT integration, because Apple has not established deals with other companies for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; integration. xAI said that if <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users want to access a generative AI chatbot, "they have no choice but to use ChatGPT, even if they would prefer to use more innovative and imaginative products like xAI's Grok."<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users can, of course, download any chatbot app from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, but xAI said that apps do not have the same "functionality, usability, and integration" as ChatGPT does with ‌&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;‌. The lawsuit also accused Apple of "deprioritizing" the apps of competing generative AI chatbots, and depriving Grok of data from billions of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users because Grok isn't integrated with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; like ChatGPT. The lawsuit claims that xAI "sought an integration" with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, and was denied.<br/>
<br/>
In a filing earlier this month, Apple and OpenAI both argued that the lawsuit is flawed because there is no exclusivity deal that prevents Apple from integrating other chatbots into &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
xAI has asked the court to put a stop to Apple and OpenAI's "anticompetitive scheme," and help it "recover billions in damages."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/grok/">Grok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/13/apple-openai-elon-musk-lawsuit-proceeds/">Apple and OpenAI Must Face xAI Lawsuit Over Siri Integration</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-openai-must-face-xai-lawsuit-over-siri-integration.2471130/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
