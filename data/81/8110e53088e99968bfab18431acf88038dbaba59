<p>It&#8217;s a <a href="https://pt-postdoc-funding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database of regularly-offered grants and fellowships</a> that are aimed at junior researchers, particularly recent PhDs.</p>
<p>The site was developed by <a href="https://www.marcuscarlsenhaggrot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcus Carlsen Häggrot</a>, a political theorist working on the philosophy of electoral participation. He writes: &#8220;So many early-career political theory scholars do not realise they can apply for individual research funding, or they are not aware of the opportunities and programmes that are available across different countries. Closing this information gap is the aim of this website.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to its list of grant programs, the site also has some basic grant application <a href="https://pt-postdoc-funding.com/grant-basics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tips</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Häggrot welcomes information about programs not yet listed, corrections and updates, and suggestions for how to improve the site.  Check it out <a href="https://pt-postdoc-funding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
