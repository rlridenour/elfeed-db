Android smartphone maker Nothing recently came out with the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro, just a little after Apple launched the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>. Since Nothing's smartphone is targeting roughly the same group of smartphone buyers as the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, we thought we'd do a comparison.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is priced at &#36;599, which is higher than any other budget smartphone that Apple has released to date, while the <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/products/phone-3a-pro">3a Pro</a> is quite a bit more affordable at &#36;459. The 3a Pro has some bells and whistles you won't get with the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; like extra cameras and a larger display, but the Qualcomm chip in the 3a Pro really can't compete with the A18 in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;. It's <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nothing_phone_3a_pro-review-2809p4.php">not even close</a>.<br/>
<br/>
While the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; has a 6.1-inch display, the 3a Pro has a larger 6.8-inch display, and it's notably larger and heavier. It has a brighter OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, while the 16e display is limited to 60Hz. In terms of design, the 16e has a classic, understated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> look with a single camera, while the 3a Pro has a large rear camera circle, a stylized mechanical look, and a ring of LED lights at the back that serve as notification alerts.<br/>
<br/>
The Nothing Phone 3a Pro has an eye-catching design for sure, but it might also be a bit much for some people. There's a single 48-megapixel Wide camera in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, but the 3a Pro has a trio of cameras, including a 50-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel Telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom, and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life is about the same between the two, and the 3a Pro has no wireless charging feature while the 16e supports slow Qi-based wireless charging. The 3a Pro does charge faster though, because it supports up to 50W wired charging.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing hasn't gone all in on AI like Apple, but there is a dedicated AI button that opens up the Essential Space, which is an AI-powered hub for notes, ideas, and inspirations. There are no image generation features or custom emoji, but it is a truly useful feature.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the major difference between the two is iOS vs. Android, so while the 3a Pro is a solid value with a good feature set, it's probably not going to lure &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users out of Apple's ecosystem.<br/>
