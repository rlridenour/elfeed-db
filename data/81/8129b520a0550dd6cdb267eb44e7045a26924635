<p>US federal prosecutors in Washington, DC have opened a criminal investigation involving Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, centered on his congressional testimony about the renovation of the Fed’s headquarters buildings. Powell said the Fed received grand jury subpoenas and described the threat of criminal charges as an attempt to influence the central bank’s policy decisions amid White House pressure for lower interest rates. President Donald Trump has denied knowing about the investigation and rejected claims that it is meant to pressure the Fed. The episode has intensified global attention on how the US balances political power and the Fed’s long-standing independence, an issue that matters well beyond American borders because US interest-rate policy influences financial conditions worldwide.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/nikoBe5nUmXd031QuWz6dDHCv1gycdfbV7ruZYaF1CL5EOKBQ80auUcyE1n6_FYxI9CFuhqfziKS5TVf4SFiGSSemBTcGg5xri0PYu0uQ6o3YppxSCMz8SgfR25SgKpOc4bwaAiGAjDxlVkJupNB7Iah7dWWSx6Quja3Fh5iG-up9JWTndNbd-J3sZr7GzYpobSNe_ttb-ne1UstyEMOm1nMciZpU3LajRfcAelXwzP_irLXYhWbR_4' alt='US President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speak during a tour of the Federal Reserve Board building in Washington, DC, on July 24, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Market moves: After Powell’s remarks, the dollar weakened and gold hit a record high, according to Semafor’s reporting on immediate market reaction.</li><li>Senate leverage: Republican Senator Thom Tillis said he would withhold votes on any Fed chair nominee “until this legal matter is fully resolved,” potentially complicating confirmations on the narrowly divided Senate Banking Committee.</li><li>Powell’s stance: Powell has cast the inquiry as a “pretext” and said he will not be intimidated into changing monetary policy, arguing rate-setting should follow evidence and economic conditions.</li><li>Project focus: The inquiry is tied to renovations of the Fed’s historic Washington headquarters complex and whether Powell misled lawmakers about aspects of the project during Senate testimony last summer.</li><li>Tenure question: The Straits Times noted Powell has not said whether he plans to remain at the central bank beyond 2025, adding uncertainty about leadership continuity.</li></ul><blockquote>This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation. - Jerome Powell</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell: Powell says prosecutors subpoenaed the Fed over his renovation testimony and he views the escalation as political pressure aimed at influencing independent rate-setting.
