<p>An overnight assault hit Niger’s main international airport and the adjacent air force base in the capital, Niamey, with gunfire and explosions reported around midnight before calm returned and airport operations resumed later in the morning. Niger’s defense ministry said its forces repelled the attackers, killing 20 and suffering four soldiers wounded, while reports said some aircraft were damaged. On Friday, the Islamic State group said it carried out a “surprise and coordinated” operation, a claim circulated via its Amaq outlet and reported by multiple media and monitors. Separately, Niger’s military leader, Gen. Abdourahamane Tiani, publicly accused France and the presidents of Benin and Côte d’Ivoire of sponsoring the assault, an allegation he made without presenting evidence; France and the two neighboring governments’ responses were not reported in the provided articles.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lwTMZEnYJtYFxCy65aflPqBzChLq4NWEkdqE2gvt-pHDHm4edpPJA16uZAwURRCdOfFHEmVHLvuqfIWuA238UT7Q8pBnpus7fPo6fLOXXYnx-NFVftiaFomE9jxUzzGWsSGOLQKHox3E3pESvGUSqvLbLVCYrD5HESvCO9E-mC0U-Z5FrLUfaUXxKhWsmWTrT3znONiDGaG4Fp4RabSriZ2j-wns0-YWdXVOb17pyZFcccGofvDA_J-6XDF38N2w0aQ32qzJODdDI9YN53dj' alt='Reported aftermath at Niamey’s international airport and adjacent air base following the overnight assault.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tactics reported: The Guardian reported the attackers used heavy weaponry and drones and moved on motorcycles during the strike.</li><li>Aircraft damage: The Guardian reported planes belonging to an Ivorian carrier and a Togolese airline were damaged.</li><li>Strategic vicinity: Bloomberg, cited by Semafor, reported the assault took place near a major uranium stockpile.</li><li>Foreign troops: Tiani thanked Russian troops stationed at the air base for “defending their sector,” reflecting Niger’s closer security ties with Moscow.</li><li>Suspect detail: Niger’s state broadcaster reported a French national was among suspects killed in the clashes, according to RT.</li></ul><blockquote>We have heard them bark, they should be ready to hear us roar - Gen.
