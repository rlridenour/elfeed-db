<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country could hold national elections within about two to three months if the United States and European allies provide additional protection against Russian attacks during the voting period and help organize the process safely. He spoke after President Trump repeated claims that Kyiv was using the war as a reason to delay a vote and urged Ukraine to move quickly toward elections as part of a broader push for a peace deal with Russia. Wartime elections are currently barred under Ukraine’s martial law, and Zelensky’s formal term ended in 2024, but he said he would ask parliament to prepare legal changes if security guarantees are agreed. Zelensky also said he would send revised proposals to Washington on ending the war, stressing that any settlement must protect Ukraine’s territory despite reports that an initial US plan was viewed in Europe as too favorable to Russia.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/d7QMfCctk0I0PpmQtGt2NCBHuz9I7GWQRkClhLIT10vfckk4IKVXtm3ZHRQlM58-9Bz2AZqBr1iRos3A8qWHn-6Y8zHoLg0dPpwB9SFrlwqCnE1AQt3fnHZ7SafR7fpwIEojeQKuQ_qBqzjw4aZoJoHdk74Uu84LekIi4ndNuAgEyUJdCDnSDkIkBVuGIWalDfC48-c3sRWD1bnR0JVScmrKVfgPyWcKEOLpnV_WGD6of2c7JBr0gzjtp8Bifk0HLrM5IFnhJpFi00qvvg' alt='President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in Kyiv during meetings on the war and the country’s political future.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Proposed timeframe: Zelensky told reporters that, with sufficient security guarantees, Ukraine could organize a national vote within roughly 60 to 90 days, describing this as a realistic window for preparing wartime elections.</li><li>Conditions on allies: He asked the US and European partners not only for extra air defense and protection for polling stations, but also for assistance in logistics and observation to ensure that any wartime ballot meets democratic standards.</li><li>Trump’s democracy criticism: President Trump argued that Ukraine &quot;talk about a democracy&quot; but risks no longer being one if it does not hold elections, and has previously described Zelensky as a &quot;dictator&quot; in criticism of the delayed vote.</li><li>Debate over peace plan: Washington has circulated a draft peace proposal that includes holding elections within about 100 days of a ceasefire with Russia, a blueprint that some European and Ukrainian officials initially saw as giving Russia too much advantage.</li><li>Zelensky’s territorial stance: Despite pressure to accept a rapid settlement, Zelensky has publicly rejected any plan that would require Ukraine to cede occupied territory to Russia as the price of peace.</li></ul><blockquote>This is a question for the people of Ukraine, not people from other states, with all due respect to our partners - Volodymyr Zelenskyy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Ukraine: Zelensky insists he is not trying to stay in office without a mandate and says he is prepared to hold a vote soon if allies help secure polling places and Ukraine’s parliament approves the necessary legal changes.
