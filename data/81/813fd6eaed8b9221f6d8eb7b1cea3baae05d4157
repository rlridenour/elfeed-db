<p>Kalley Huang and Tripp Mickle, writing for The New York Times (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Threading the needle between adding new bells and whistles to
Apple’s products while watching the bottom line has defined the
careful, low-profile style of Mr. Ternus, who joined Apple in
2001. He is now considered by some company insiders to be the
front-runner to replace Tim Cook, Apple’s longtime chief
executive, if Mr. Cook decides to step aside.</p>

<p>Apple last year began accelerating its planning for Mr. Cook’s
succession, according to three people close to the company who
spoke on the condition of anonymity about Apple’s confidential
deliberations. Mr. Cook, 65, has told senior leaders that he is
tired and would like to reduce his workload, the people said.
Should he step down, Mr. Cook is likely to become the chairman of
Apple’s board, according to three people close to the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cook may well be preparing to retire as CEO. He is 65! But it doesn’t ring true to me that he’s telling “senior leaders” that he’s tired. First, I’ve heard otherwise from actual senior leaders at the company. Second, any senior leader he’d tell that to, if true, wouldn’t share it.</p>

<p>It seems to me that aside from the utterly normal and plainly obvious speculation that, at age 65, he might be on the cusp of retiring as CEO, there’s something going on where a narrative is being spread that Cook is in poor health. Mark Gurman included two paragraphs about a tremor in Cook’s hands <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/08/srouji">in his colossal fuck-up at Bloomberg a month ago</a>, falsely reporting that Johny Srouji was unhappy and on the cusp of leaving Apple for a competitor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite his low profile, Mr. Ternus appears to have shot to the
front of the pack to be Apple’s next C.E.O., according to four
people close to the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Times report describes Ternus as “low-profile” three times. This makes no sense. Ternus is one of Apple’s <em>highest</em>-profile executives. I would guess that over the last five years he’s appeared in more keynotes, for more time, than anyone but Cook and Craig Federighi.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But Mr. Cook is also preparing several other internal candidates
to be his potential successor, two of the people said. They could
include Craig Federighi, Apple’s head of software; Eddy Cue, its
head of services; Greg Joswiak, its head of worldwide marketing;
and Deirdre O’Brien, its head of retail and human resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think there’s any chance that Cook’s successor will be someone who isn’t a frequent presence in Apple keynotes. I can’t recall O’Brien ever appearing in a keynote, and Cue hasn’t appeared in one for several years. Also, Cue is 61 and Joz is 62. Neither is that much younger than Cook.</p>

<p>Two interesting tidbits re: Ternus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Within about three years, he became a manager, said Steve Siefert,
Mr. Ternus’s first boss at Apple. During that time, their team
moved office floors, switching from a closed office plan to mostly
open seating with a few offices. When he was promoted, Mr. Ternus
had the option to move into one of those offices but declined.</p>

<p>Mr. Ternus was “a man of the people,” Mr. Siefert said, adding
that the decision to sit with his team likely helped Mr. Ternus
manage and motivate his staff. When Mr. Siefert retired in 2011,
freeing up his office, Mr. Ternus once again said he wanted to
remain in the open space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you want to make an iPhone every year, Ternus is your guy,”
said Cameron Rogers, who worked on product and software
engineering management at Apple from 2005 to 2022. [...]</p>

<p>“He’s a nice guy,” Mr. Rogers said. “He’s someone you want to hang
out with. Everyone loves him because he’s great. Has he made any
hard decisions? No. Are there hard problems he’s solved in
hardware? No.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This guy Cameron Rogers sounds like a real asshole.</p>

<p>What complaints does anyone have about Apple hardware over the last five years? Off the top of my head I can’t think of any that are serious. Ternus has overseen what I’d argue is the best sustained stretch of Apple hardware, across more product lines than ever, in the company’s 50-year history. But he didn’t make any hard decisions or solve any hard problems. Sure. Hardware is easy.</p>
