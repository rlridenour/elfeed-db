It has been a slow start to 2026 for Apple product launches, with only <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-announces-new-airtag/">a new AirTag</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-introduces-new-black-unity-apple-watch-band/">special Apple Watch band</a> released so far. We are still waiting for MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, the iPhone 17e, a lower-cost MacBook with an iPhone chip, long-rumored updates to the Apple TV and HomePod mini, and much more.<br/>
