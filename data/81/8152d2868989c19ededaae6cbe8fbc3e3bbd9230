Apple does not plan to refresh any Macs with updated M5 chips in 2025, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-10/apple-plans-new-macbook-pro-iphone-17e-and-ipads-by-early-2026">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. Updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models are now planned for the first half of 2026.<br/>

Gurman previously said that Apple would debut the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models in late 2025, but his newest report suggests that Apple is "considering" pushing them back to 2026. Apple is now said to be "internally targeting" a launch early next year.<br/>
<br/>
The current M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models were announced in October 2024 and released in November 2024, so pushing the M5 models back to 2026 would see Apple skipping a yearly refresh. It is typical for new Macs to come out in October or November after the September <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> event.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does not give a reason why Apple is potentially "delaying" the launch of the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models, but he says the timing is fluid, so there may still be a chance that we get the new Macs before the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
The M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models will have few changes beyond the M5 chip update, because Apple is planning for bigger changes in for the M6 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;. The next &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models are expected to transition to OLED displays and new case designs. Rumors have suggested the OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; would come in 2026, but if Apple is planning to launch the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models in 2026, that might mean the OLED model will be pushed to 2027. Alternatively, Apple could debut the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; in early 2026 and the OLED version in late 2026, but that would be unusual.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also planning to release M5 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models in 2026, which will replace the current M4 models. Other rumors suggest Apple is working on a MacBook that has an A18 Pro chip in it for 2026, but Gurman didn't mention it. <br/>

The M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models could be accompanied by a new display that Apple has in the works. Apple is developing an external monitor that is expected to be a follow up to the 2022 Studio Display. It is expected to launch in early 2026.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/">M5 MacBook Pro No Longer Coming in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m5-macbook-pro-no-longer-coming-in-2025.2461339/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
