<p>After all my recent&nbsp;<em>whining</em>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2025/03/googles-ai-search-mode-what-it-means-for-users-and-creators">Artificial Intelligence kneecapping traffic to small publishers</a>, I got a little surprise from WordPress…</p>



<p>Turns out, traffic to&nbsp;<a href="http://macsparky.com/">macSparky.com</a>&nbsp;is way up — so much so that it’s been exceeding the limits of my previous hosting plan. As of today, MacSparky is running on its very own isolated server at WordPress.</p>



<p>The site is now running faster than ever before, and it’s the most stable it’s ever been. I’m genuinely excited about this change and grateful for all the readers who continue to stop by, especially in this strange, AI-distorted era of the web.</p>



<p>Thanks for being here. More good stuff will keep coming your way.</p>
