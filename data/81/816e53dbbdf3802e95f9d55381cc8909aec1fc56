<p>In 1880, an 800-year-old yew tree was threatening the west wall of the church of St Andrew at Buckland in Dover. The community called in landscape gardener William Barron, who solved the problem by boring tunnels under the trunk and then raising the tree&#8217;s entire 55-ton mass onto rollers by means of powerful screw jacks. Giant windlasses could then haul the tree 203 feet across the churchard to a safer location.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scale of this operation was probably never matched,&#8221; writes G.M.F. Drower in <a href="https://archive.org/details/gardenofinventio0000drow/page/20/mode/2up"><em>Garden of Invention</em></a>, his 2003 history of gardening innovations. &#8220;[A]nd Barron, who had been rather more apprehensive than he let on, later admitted that all the other trees he had moved had been &#8216;chickens compared to the Buckland Yew.'&#8221;</p>
