<p>Pleased to announce I will be showing some mixed media paintings and sculpture in this show in York with fellow MA Fine Art students from <a href="https://www.yorksj.ac.uk/">York St John University</a></p>
<p>Opening tonight! 17th September @5pm. The show runs until Friday 20th September 2019 and we will be moving on to take part with the Global Strike. We have a schedule of spoken word poetry performances and musical contribution on the opening night, with free wine and all that good stuff. Will be great to see you there for our final send off.</p>
