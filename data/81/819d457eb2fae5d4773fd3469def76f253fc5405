<p>&#8220;The dirtiest secret in higher education is that there is no good data on the quality of teaching and teachers on college campuses.&#8221;<span id="more-55954"></span></p>
<p>So begins an interesting essay, &#8220;<a href="https://hollisrobbinsanecdotal.substack.com/p/teaching-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teaching Quality</a>,&#8221; by <a href="https://profiles.faculty.utah.edu/u6043188" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hollis Robbins</a> at her newsletter, <a href="https://hollisrobbinsanecdotal.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Anecdotal Value</em></a>.</p>
<p>Robbins laments the lack of data on instructional quality in higher education. Widely used student evaluations of teaching aren&#8217;t helpful, she says, owing to them &#8220;being designed to measure [student] satisfaction, not [teacher] quality.&#8221; Furthermore, their results are largely unavailable to those outside of the institutions in which they&#8217;re administered. What Robbins is looking for is data from which those inside and outside institutions can come to know how good the teachers are at them.</p>
<p>In the absence of such data, she estimates, based on her observations over 30 years in academia as a professor and dean, &#8220;that except for very elite private institutions&#8230; well over half of university instruction across the US is fair to poor. Perhaps 25% is good and 5% is excellent.&#8221; Your own estimates may vary.</p>
<p>Robbins takes the lack of data as a problem (for example, she asks who is to &#8220;blame&#8221; for it), but we might pause right here and ask <em>why </em>the lack of data is a problem.</p>
<p>It seems that Robbins takes the lack of <em>data</em> about the quality of college teaching to be related to both the lack of <em>knowledge</em> about the quality of college teaching and the persistence of the (in her estimation) low general quality of college teaching. Further, it is clear that Robbins thinks the existence of such data would be ultimately conducive to better teaching, and enable institutions of higher education to assure students, parents, lawmakers, and the public that college (suitably reformed) is worth it, even in an era of AI and corporate alternatives.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s some room for questions in this analysis.</p>

<p>First, we might recall that data and knowledge are not synonyms, and that a lack of the former does not imply a lack of the latter. Data has its benefits, but what Robbins needs to get us to believe is that the marginal informational value of data, on top of what we already or could know without it, outweighs its costs (not just the costs of acquiring it, but especially the costs of the various ways in which, once it exists, it might be used&#8212;more on that later).</p>
<p>So what do we already know, and who knows it? Don&#8217;t at least some departments know which of their teachers are generally better or worse, and in which respects? Don&#8217;t they have means, such as classroom observations, that could be put to use in learning about teacher quality? Might students&#8217; demonstrations of knowledge and skill in a course with a prerequisite be indicative, to some extent, of the quality of the teaching of that prerequisite? Which professors do students choose to take independent studies with? Hollis may rightly scoff at student evaluations of teaching&#8212;they do have their problems&#8212;but similar answers from multiple students to specific qualitative questions about teaching can indicate particular teaching problems (e.g., doesn&#8217;t provide feedback on work) or strengths (e.g., met regularly with students outside of class), even if such information isn&#8217;t presented in a wholly quantifiable form.</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t these and other formal and informal means productive of some knowledge about teacher quality?</p>
<p>I assume that Robbins would say that the problem is that this knowledge is not readily exportable to those outside the institutions, and as a result, it is not readily usable as a means by which to hold the institutions accountable for the quality of their teaching. Data can be a tool for accountability.</p>
<p>It <em>can</em> be. But will it be? Is the kind of accountability such data facilitates likely to produce better teaching? Maybe, but I don&#8217;t see why we should assume it would.</p>
<p>Faculty are part of the problem, according to Robbins, since they &#8220;want even less attention paid to teaching quality than their institutions do.&#8221; Perhaps, but why? Part of the explanation, not mentioned by Robbins, must be the professional incentives faculty face. If universities started promoting people on the basis of their teaching rather than their research, more faculty would care more about teaching, and probably be better at it. Here the solution is a change in tenure and promotion policy, not the acquisition of more data.</p>
<p>But perhaps faculty are indeed resistant to more data collection about teaching. If they are, I think that is in part explained by quite reasonable concerns about how the data would be collected and used (concerns which are related to my earlier comments about costs and accountability).</p>
<p>The most significant concern is sometimes referred to as surrogation: the phenomenon of a <em>measure</em> of a quality replacing, in practice, the quality itself.</p>
<p>Surrogation contributes to what&#8217;s sometimes known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campbell&#8217;s Law</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.</em></p>
<p>Any observer of K-12 education in the US is familiar with examples of surrogation and Campbell&#8217;s Law, as students at every level are subject to curricula aimed not at producing learning itself, but at producing high scores on standardized exams put in place to measure learning. Such exams were implemented to generate data in response to real problems with educational quality and fairness. But I don&#8217;t know anyone who would look at the &#8220;teaching to the test&#8221; such well-meaning data collection has wrought and be happy about it. Do we think our young students are learning better under a data-dominated educational regime? Do we think our teachers are teaching better under it? No and no.</p>
<p>The idea of a large scale attempt to gather data about teaching quality in higher education raises similar prospects. What are the instruments by which such data would likely be collected? Standardized exams? Why wouldn&#8217;t this reproduce the same counterproductive and unintended consequences it has at lower educational levels? Shouldn&#8217;t that prospect have us also worried about reduced academic freedom in teaching, and about the erosion of a valuable pluralism within and across institutions?</p>
<p>I understand that Robbins sees data as a key to the survival of higher education, as a way of showing the rest of our culture that going to university is still worth it. But to me it just further adds to the likelihood that higher education ends up drowned after suffering too many hits from carelessly tossed lifesavers (like &#8220;tell them to go to college to get a good job!&#8221; or &#8220;become an &#8216;AI-powered&#8217; university!&#8221;).</p>
<p>Because Robbins has a dim view of current teacher quality, she says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Lawmakers should focus less on politics and efficiency and start asking for value-added learning data. Parents should start asking, “How do you guarantee the quality of the professors my college student will face?”</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t disagree that teaching and learning at the university level could improve. But it seems unlikely to me that the blunt data-collecting instruments most likely to be demanded by politicians and most likely to be marketed to parents as a simple way to choose among colleges will lead to such improvement. Once the &#8220;value-added&#8221; by a university education is surrogated by data gleaned from standardized exams, universities become even more vulnerable to replacement by more &#8220;efficient&#8221; means to higher test scores.</p>
<p>If Robbins hopes to save universities a space in a world that increasingly treats higher education as vocational training and that increasingly invites AIs to do our thinking and communicating for us, calling for a metric that will reduce all the various things a university can do for students to a few numbers does not seem like a promising strategy.</p>
<p>But it could be that I&#8217;m overly pessimistic or unimaginative in considering the options.
