<p><a href="https://lucasigel.com/">Luke Igel</a> and <a href="https://walzr.com/">Riley Walz</a> made a phony Gmail interface that, rather than showing you <em>your</em> email, shows you Jeffrey Epstein’s emails:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re logged in as Jeffrey Epstein. We compiled these Epstein
estate emails from the House Oversight release by converting the
PDFs to structured text with an LLM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brilliant.</p>
