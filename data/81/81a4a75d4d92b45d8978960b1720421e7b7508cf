<p id="p2">Today, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/05/apple-introduces-the-2025-pride-collection/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple introduced their 2025 Pride Collection</a>, with a set of new LGBTQ+-themed wallpapers for iOS and iPadOS that will be available as part of iOS and iPadOS 18.5. The collection also includes an Apple Watch Pride Edition Sports band, which matches a new Pride Harmony watch face in watchOS 11.5.</p>
<p id="p3">Despite being just another installment in what has become <a href="https://www.macstories.net/?s=pride" rel="noopener noreferrer">an annual tradition</a> for the company, the 2025 collection rings hollow in contrast with Apple&rsquo;s stance regarding the current U.S. administration.</p>

<p id="p5">On January 20th, President Trump signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" rel="noopener noreferrer">executive orders</a> that have already gravely <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/anti-trans-national-risk-assessment" rel="noopener noreferrer">impacted trans people across the United States</a>. Despite the President&rsquo;s clear intentions to do so before he was sworn into office, <a href="https://www.them.us/story/tim-cook-apple-ceo-trump-inauguration-donation" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple CEO Tim Cook chose to donate $1M to the President&rsquo;s inauguration fund</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-inauguration-ceo-guests-bezos-zuckerberg-musk-2025-1?op=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">attended the inauguration</a> alongside other American tech company leaders, including Google&rsquo;s Sundar Pichai, Amazon&rsquo;s Jeff Bezos, and Meta&rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg. The latter three <a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-diversity-equity-inclusion-program-trump-16a937d5d9b6447251c4c40c2ad1c915" rel="noopener noreferrer">have</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmy7xpw3pyo" rel="noopener noreferrer">all</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/10/meta-dei-memo-employees-programs" rel="noopener noreferrer">scrapped</a> Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) efforts inside their respective companies, following the President&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-protects-civil-rights-and-merit-based-opportunity-by-ending-illegal-dei/" rel="noopener noreferrer">executive order terminating U.S. government DEI initiatives</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/19/nx-s1-5317567/federal-websites-lgbtq-diversity-erased" rel="noopener noreferrer">scrubbing governmental documents of all references to trans people</a>. In February, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/25/apple-tim-cook-dei-program-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple shareholders rejected a proposal to follow the government&rsquo;s lead</a>, choosing to preserve the company&rsquo;s diversity programs. However, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/25/apple-tim-cook-dei-program-vote/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAs%20the%20legal%20landscape%20around%20this%20issue%20evolves%2C%20we%20may%20need%20to%20make%20some%20changes%20to%20comply%2C%20but%20our%20north%20star%20of%20dignity%20and%20respect%20for%20everyone%20and%20our%20work%20to%20that%20end%20will%20never%20waver%2C%E2%80%9D%20Mr%20Cook%20said%20during%20a%20question%2Dand%2Danswer%20session%20at%20the%20company%E2%80%99s%20annual%20shareholder%20meeting.%C2%A0" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cook hedged saying</a> that the company &ldquo;<em>may need to make some changes to comply</em>&rdquo;, while also reassuring that Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver</em>.&rdquo; Then last week, Cook remotely appeared at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6eqLXasVGg" rel="noopener noreferrer">a celebration of the President&rsquo;s first 100 days in office</a>.</p>
<p id="p6">This seemingly nuanced alignment with President Trump contrasts with Tim Cook&rsquo;s outspoken support for the LGBTQ+ community <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141030111931/http://businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-im-proud-to-be-gay" rel="noopener noreferrer">when he came out in 2014</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/2014/06/30/tim-cook-led-5000-from-apple-at-gay-pride-parade/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s continued participation in the San Francisco Pride Parade</a>. The same dissonance appears in the final sentence of the company&rsquo;s press release which states that &ldquo;<em>Apple is proud to financially support organizations that serve LGBTQ+ communities.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p id="p7">Today&rsquo;s announcement of the 2025 Pride Collection&rsquo;s made me think back to <a href="https://joe-steel.com/2025-01-25-Tim-Cook-Is-Failing-Us.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Rosensteel&rsquo;s great piece</a> that he published in January soon after the inauguration, in which he expresses immense disappointment in Tim Cook. In regard to Apple&rsquo;s yearly Apple Watch Pride bands and its participation in the San Francisco Pride parade, he rightly asked:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote8"><p>
  <em>How should people reconcile Tim&rsquo;s explicit support of Trump with his support of trans and enby people working at Apple, buying products from Apple, and attending pride parades with Apple?</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p9">At a time when some trans people are actively seeking to <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/66072/1/i-dont-feel-safe-trans-people-are-planning-to-leave-the-us" rel="noopener noreferrer">flee the U.S.</a> to preserve their fundamental right to a healthy, safe, and decent life free from the threat of President Trump&rsquo;s actions, Apple doesn&rsquo;t seem to be stepping up to its professed values to the extent that the situation requires. As of today, there have been no reports of the company increasing its financial support of organizations that support LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. Nor has Apple attempted to publicly and explicitly speak out against the administration&rsquo;s attacks targeting trans people. Instead, Apple has chosen to simply iterate on its Pride wallpapers and watch bands, which will <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MFFP4AM/A/40mm-pride-edition-sport-band-s-m" rel="noopener noreferrer">retail at $49</a>.</p>
<p id="p10">Maybe I should feel relieved that Apple chose not to discontinue the Pride Collection. But considering the urgency felt by the LGBTQ+ community, Apple releasing Pride bands and wallpapers is simply not enough to compensate for its decision not to speak out against President Trump&rsquo;s attacks on trans people. There are certainly risks to Apple if it were to do more to stand up for the LGBTQ+ community, but those risks pale in comparison to the increasing threats trans and other people in the LGBTQ+ community face in the U.S. <a href="https://transrescue.org/press-release-transgender-people-are-escaping-the-uk-says-dutch-ngo" rel="noopener noreferrer">and around the world</a> every day. It&rsquo;s time for Apple to step up and do more than wallpapers and a watch band.</p>
