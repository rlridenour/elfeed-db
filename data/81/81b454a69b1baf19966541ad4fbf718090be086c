<p>On Reddit a couple of weeks back, u/fela_nascarfan made the post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1lutgc0/new_emacs_tshirt/">New Emacs T-Shirt</a> which both made me laugh and inspired want for such a nerd-kitch (yet cool!) t-shirt. Something visually striking with just enough absurd would definitely start a conversation, which I think ties in well with this month’s Emacs Carnival topic “<a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/08/01/emacs-carnival-2025-08-your-elevator-pitch-for-emacs/">Your Elevator Pitch for Emacs</a>”.</p>
<p>Sadly, the FSF doesn’t have the Emacs vaporwave merch of my dreams, but I can channel my inner Napoleon Dynamite to type into an AI prompt and see what happens.</p>
<p>Sharing the results of my wanton foolishness below. Who knows what happens next, but everything starts as an idea, no?</p>
<p>Outrun energy.</p>
