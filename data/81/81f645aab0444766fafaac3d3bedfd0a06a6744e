<p>President Trump said the future of Ukraine peace negotiations is uncertain after US envoys held lengthy talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin that produced no clear breakthrough on ending the war. The White House had hoped Moscow and Kyiv would agree to a deal by Thanksgiving, but that informal target has passed without an accord, leaving US officials to decide whether a negotiated settlement is still reachable in the near term. Russian officials described the Moscow meeting with special envoy Steve Witkoff and presidential adviser Jared Kushner as constructive and said Putin had accepted parts of a US-backed plan while rejecting others, indicating that gaps remain on key issues. Trump said his envoys came away believing Putin &quot;would like to end the war&quot; and announced that Witkoff will now meet top Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov in Miami, keeping a multi-track diplomatic effort alive despite the lack of immediate progress.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ZK1rz8KB1kIFPeQPh85yOurgB_fDgvOVkw5bNVJUjgRFJjJEKU11hLIHzEHezSpx5oHqr8xHlWrU1c0aLaZ-UJK1dsKApg0L8dqXRVsNAe7m63K92wBbz5k5W1WWLVspWmjkQ4wftmBr24OtFTcnGgVzSdxKokv9HBoooAf4LnSVHqC2DY4rCvC47m2ozDne4rkeJXdUUmbrqY3ELAjg0nQjhu3SWpKyDw2pNIBRFJoOge-NSZglmSsdWUCn2N31IM12aahFK-nJWDds4Q' alt='President Trump and President Putin shake hands during an earlier meeting, symbolizing the renewed US-Russia contacts now focused on Ukraine peace talks.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Moscow discussions: Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner held hours-long talks at the Kremlin that stretched into the early morning, underscoring the depth of the US-Russia discussion even though no final agreement emerged.</li><li>Russian response: Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov called the US envoys’ visit &quot;constructive, very useful, and substantive&quot; while spokesman Dmitry Peskov said some American proposals were accepted and others deemed unacceptable, and argued negotiations should proceed out of the media spotlight rather than through &quot;megaphone diplomacy&quot;.</li><li>Ukrainian position: Trump said Ukraine is &quot;very satisfied&quot; with the current US proposal given its battlefield situation, and US officials confirmed that Rustem Umerov will represent Kyiv in the upcoming talks in Florida.</li><li>Missed deadline: The New York Times reports that an internal White House goal of reaching a Russia-Ukraine settlement by Thanksgiving has lapsed, prompting debate inside the administration about whether to keep pushing for an early deal or recalibrate expectations and timelines.</li><li>Trump’s assessment: Trump publicly repeated his view that earlier this year would have been a more favorable time for Ukraine to seek a settlement, saying he had urged Kyiv to pursue peace then because he believed it had limited leverage in negotiations.</li></ul><blockquote>What comes out of that meeting, I can’t tell you, because it does take two to tango. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Trump described the talks between Putin and his envoys as &quot;reasonably good&quot; but said the next steps are unclear and emphasized that any outcome depends on both Russia and Ukraine agreeing to compromise.
