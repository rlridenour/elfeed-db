A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13349">Álvaro Ramírez&rsquo;s time-zones package</a>. It&rsquo;s a package that expands on the built in <code>world clock</code> function by allowing cities to be added and deleted on the fly and by allowing the target time to be adjusted forward or backward.

When I wrote about it, it had just been released and was not yet on Melpa. Now, thankfully, Ramírez <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1ohcnor/timezones_now_on_melpa_do_i_have_your_support/">has added it to Melpa and made some enhancements</a>, such as implementing DST and UTC. The original Irreal post got a couple of comments from people who have installed it and they seem happy.

Ramírez is an independent developer and provides apps such as time-zones as a public service. You can download and use it for free but it&rsquo;s also important to support his efforts. The best way of doing this, I think, is by buying one or more of his paid apps such as <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only">Journelly</a>, which I&rsquo;ve written about many times. I use it constantly, several times a day and, at this point, couldn&rsquo;t live without it. You&rsquo;ll be helping Ramírez and yourself by getting a copy. If you don&rsquo;t want to buy one of his apps, you can <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium">become a sponser</a>.</p>
