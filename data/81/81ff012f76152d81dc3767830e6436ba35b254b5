<p>A Philippine court on 20 November 2025 convicted Alice Guo — a Chinese national who had posed as a Filipina to hold elective office — of human trafficking and sentenced her to life imprisonment for her role in operating a scam compound in Bamban, Tarlac province. Authorities linked the compound to organised online scams and said investigators found documentation tying Guo to the company that owned the site; prosecutors say hundreds of foreign and local workers were exploited there. The conviction is part of a wider effort by Philippine authorities and regional partners to dismantle transnational scam and illegal online gambling networks.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/HgA1E8NTzrTSINK_fPJiqEjPwI-4sVq0lQLn1HpZkV4Zm8H-6DzF_q1MnJw9qp7kjak3tH3ZSytd_8nB0NL2gYPExd7IZqfueTOC3ClcLYxSf-MxHJF1xwo9SX9Hx-NHFnsIgknt-0wEtHgAE3eJl5mjzMGDk-OGoCZwpFEDrDLzp3dP76Dx_zyzPVmE2A-ce6I' alt='Alice Guo, the former mayor of Bamban in the Philippines, during a Senate hearing in 2024.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Documentary evidence: Prosecutors presented company records and paperwork that they say show Guo was president of the firm that owned the compound where victims were held</li><li>Methods of coercion: Court evidence and reporting describe victims being forced to run online scams under threats, and prosecutors said detainees faced physical abuse or torture if they did not cooperate</li><li>Co-defendants sentenced: The court handed life terms to Guo and seven other defendants found guilty in the same case, according to prosecutors speaking outside the trial</li><li>Legal classification: Guo was convicted of qualified human trafficking, a charge used by Philippine prosecutors to cover recruitment and exploitation tied to organised crime, and she had been detained since last year pending trial</li></ul><blockquote>Alice was convicted and seven others, and it’s life sentence, - Olivia Torrevillas</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Philippine prosecutors: Prosecutors said Guo recruited foreign nationals to work at the compound and presented records tying her to the company that owned the site, framing the operation as part of organised criminal activity.
