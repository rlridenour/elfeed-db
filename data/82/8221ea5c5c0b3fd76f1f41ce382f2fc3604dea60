<p>In his <em>Canterbury Puzzles</em> of 1907, Henry Dudeney <a href="https://archive.org/details/117770747/page/24/mode/2up">posed</a> a now-famous challenge: How can you cut an equilateral triangle into four pieces that can be reassembled to form a perfect square?</p>

<p>Dudeney&#8217;s <a href="https://archive.org/details/117770747/page/142/mode/2up">beautiful solution</a> was accompanied by a rather involved geometric derivation. It seems unlikely that he worked this out laboriously in approaching an answer to the problem, but how then did he reach it?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one possibility: If a strip of squares is draped adroitly over a strip of triangles, their intersection forms a wordless proof of the task&#8217;s feasibility:</p>

<p>Whether that was Dudeney&#8217;s path to the solution is not known, but it appears at least plausible.</p>
