  <p>It’s possible that this strident defense is backfiring — creating
a “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gina-rinehart-portrait-australia-national-gallery-lesson-in-streisand-effect-2024-5">Streisand Effect</a>” that’s publicizing the book even more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notopoulos isn’t one to pull punches or hedge, normally, but there’s no question that Meta has Streisand Effected the hell out of <a href="https://amzn.to/4hGWXHH">Wynn-Williams’s <em>Careless People</em></a>. I’m on my way to buy a copy this afternoon and I hadn’t even heard of its existence a day ago.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sarah Wynn-Williams worked at Facebook from 2011 to 2017 — and
her <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-board-game-careless-people-sarah-wynn-williams-2025-3">book, “Careless People</a>,” details what she said were a
bunch of bad things the company did. It also contains allegations
that Joel Kaplan — who is now Meta’s chief global affairs officer — sexually harassed her. (Meta said this week that Kaplan had
been cleared of the harassment allegations in 2017 after it
investigated Wynn-Williams’ complaint.)</p>

<p>The book was released with hardly any pre-publishing fanfare: It
was announced by its publisher, Flatiron Books, an imprint of
Macmillan, only a few days before it came out Tuesday. That’s an
unusually short timeline.</p>

<p>Meta’s reaction has been emphatic and multi-pronged. The company
created a <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sarah-Wynn-Williams-New-Book-Of-Old-News.pdf">page on its website</a> that detailed a series of
the claims in the book. It said some of these — like claims
about its ambitions in China or its alleged failure to act in
Myanmar — have already been reported in the news media as far
back as 2017 and have been acknowledged by the company publicly.
The company lists seven “new” claims from the book and then
offers links to past coverage and company responses — calling
the claims “old news.”</p>

<p>Meta’s strongest move was on Wednesday when it won <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-legal-win-bars-former-exec-promoting-book-careless-people-2025-3">a ruling in
arbitration</a> that said Wynn-Williams could no longer promote
the book because of a non-disparagement clause in a contract she
signed as an employee. The ruling was granted on an emergency
basis and is temporary pending the completion of the full
arbitration process, The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/03/13/careless-people-facebook-meta-arbitration/">reported</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“<em>Read the book that Meta not only doesn’t want you to read, but wants to prevent its author from even talking about</em>” is a hell of a marketing angle. What an own goal.</p>
