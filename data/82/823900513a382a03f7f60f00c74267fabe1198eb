I came across Hourly Comic Day<sup><a id="fnr.hourly" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.hourly" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> in
<a href="https://anhvn.com/posts/2025/weeknotes-29/#:~:text=knife!%20Fuck%20that!!!-,Hourly%20Comic%20Day,-Another%20year%2C%20another">anhvn's weeknotes</a>. I've been meaning to make some
kind of timeline, even if it doesn't feel as
insightful or humorous as other people's comics.
That's a skill, I can develop it. Besides,
<a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2011/04/writing-more-about-life/">capturing bits and pieces of my life now</a> is likely
to be something I'm glad for later on.
</p>

<p>
Some things I notice:
</p>

<p>
<b>I'm A+'s default parent,</b> so she comes to me for
snuggles during recess and lunch, and she wants to
spend time with me when she's bored. She's 9, as I
keep reminding myself, so this is a time-limited
offer. It's amazing. At the moment, she often
chooses to hug me instead of read books or play
Minecraft, or chooses to play Minecraft with me
instead of by herself. Inevitably, the day will
come when she'll switch to just grunting at me
from time to time and then disappear into her room
for hours on end. This is the time to snuggle and
hang out.
</p>

<p>
<b>I have maybe an hour of reliable focus time</b>
right after lunch. I could have more, but I like
setting aside some time for playing the piano and
for walking.
</p>

</figure>

</div>

<p>
Playing the piano is an exercise in humility. I
can't quite get my fingers to do what I want them
to do, and my brain picks up phrases more slowly
than I'd like.<sup><a id="fnr.brain-speed" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.brain-speed" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> But it's also enjoyable to hear
myself learn, so I continue.
</p>

<p>
Walking is good for me. It's important to keep
moving. Biking gets me farther, but I have to pay
more attention. Walking helps me have extra
thinking time. I take a lapel mic along so that I
can use the time to <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2023/12/audio-braindump-workflow-tweaks-adding-org-mode-hyperlinks-to-recordings-based-on-keywords/">talk to myself</a>. I notice I'm
not the only one talking to myself in the park. I
also like how I see other people out there with
books, or with cameras, or with their lunches, or
simply sitting on a bench and enjoying the sun.
It's reassuring to see other people enjoying a
slower pace.
</p>

<p>
I usually run out of thoughts to think before I
run out of trails to walk. It's interesting.
Sometimes I wonder how I might tinker with that. I
have plenty of source material to think about from
books and life experiences, but maybe I can dig
into things further. Or maybe lowering the
threshold with stream-of-consciousness dictation
will help me bring more of my monkey mind out into
the light. It's also okay to enjoy the quiet.
Running into the limits of my thoughts makes it
easier to use my computer time for tasks or coding
instead of staring at a blank text file. When I do
find myself drawn to a topic, then the
braindumping gives me a head start on figuring out
the parts of it that I care about.
</p>

<p>
<b>I'm here because I choose to be.</b> I could
theoretically have a two-hour chunk in the
evenings if I really wanted to, but then A+ tends
to just watch videos. Sometimes if she's in a
video-watching mood, I'll squeeze in some writing
or some code, but it's not reliable and she might
stop at any time, so I don't like to get into
anything too deep.
</p>

<p>
I haven't been doing much consulting lately, since
that's hard to do in small bursts. There are a
couple of front-end Javascript requests on my
list, but it's a little challenging for me to get
into front-end tinkering because I have to load a
fair bit of context into my brain when I'm trying
to work around the vendor's way of doing things.
I'll probably let them know I can't get around to
those requests for now. Maybe someday.
</p>

<p>
I miss being in flow,<sup><a id="fnr.missing-flow" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.missing-flow" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> but since
that can often result in my experience A+'s
desires for connection as an interruption (the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovsiankina_effect">Ovsiankina effect</a><sup><a id="fnr.ovsiankina" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.ovsiankina" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> doesn't help),
that's not a good fit for right now. Instead, I'll
accept that this is the time for (mostly)
fragmentary chaos, but I can still occasionally
squeeze in 15 minutes here and
there.<sup><a id="fnr.meditations" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.meditations" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup> The lack of focused time
used to make me a little frustrated and antsy, but
I think it's becoming a little easier as A+
becomes more independent. I can both see the light
at the end of the tunnel and know that our paths
will diverge.
</p>

<p>
I could have oodles of focused time during the day
if A+ were to go to in-person school, but
fortunately, I know from my <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/category/experiment">experiment with
semi-retirement</a> that I probably won't actually end
up writing a book or changing the world even if I
have more focused time. Virtual school continues
to be a reasonable fit for us.
</p>

<p>
Since I know I've only got about an hour of
focused time a day, I can try to choose things
carefully. It's surprisingly freeing, knowing that
I'm not going to get to everything.<sup><a id="fnr.defeat" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.defeat" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup> I tend to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Code little things for myself, because it's fun
and it can make things marginally easier. I like
tinkering with Emacs, although sometimes I also
write Javascript or Python to automate things.</li>
<li>Writing and drawing, because then I can
understand and remember things a little better</li>
<li>Working on important tasks, like doing our taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>
And then the odds and ends of time can be used for:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>More writing: usually on my laptop, but
sometimes on my phone too. It helps to keep my
laptop on the main floor instead of leaving it
upstairs.</li>
<li>Reading books and blog posts, especially when I
can highlight and capture snippets. The iPad has
come in handy for this.</li>
<li>Coding, but only things that I can put down easily</li>
<li>Tidying: always good to stay on top of things</li>
</ul>

<p>
E-mail tends to fall to the bottom of my list,
especially e-mails that require thought and
consideration. Even reviewing my inbox tends to be
lower-priority, unless there's something I
remember and want to work on.
</p>

</figure>

</div>

<p>
<b>So this is my life at the moment.</b> This is
already a big step up from before. Since A+
handles virtual school a little more independently
now, I can mostly count on a bit of focused time,
instead of living my days in interruption limbo.
</p>

<p>
It's pretty easy-going. It feels a little like
we're making this breakwater around a bay, so that
A+ can learn the ropes in a reasonably calm
environment instead of being buffeted around by
the stormy waves outside, and then she can sail
out when she's ready. As lives go, this is all
right.
</p>

<p>
Seasons come and seasons go. I'm glad my day gets
to look like this. Even if it might seem pretty
humdrum, I want to remember it, because there'll
be a time when I'll miss us.
