<a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13167">As I mentioned last week</a>, this month&rsquo;s Emacs Carnival challenge is to make an elevator pitch for Emacs. It&rsquo;s a pretty tough assignment. Realistically, you have less than a minute to convince your captive audience that they should give Emacs a try. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d be up to it.

<p>
We <i>do</i>, however, have two bloggers willing to try. <a href="https://christiantietze.de/posts/2025/08/emacs-elevator-pitch/">Christian Tietze</a> and <a href="https://www.cyan.sh/blog/posts/consistency.html">Jakub Nowak</a> have each offered their take on the matter. Although they use slightly different approaches, their pitches are remarkably similar. They both emphasize that with Emacs you get a uniform interface and a minimum of context switching. Rather than dealing with separate applications and their different interfaces for your tasks, you can bring the majority of them under the Emacs umbrella and enjoy a single interface for all of them.

There are menus if you want them but, for me, a chief strength is that you can do everything without using a mouse. After all, Emacs was developed for use on a terminal long before the ascendancy of mice.

It&rsquo;s interesting to me that both Tietze and Nowak chose to stress interface consistency. It is, for sure, an important aspect of Emacs use but, surely, there are more important aspects to discuss. The problem is that it&rsquo;s hard to discuss those other aspects in the time required for an elevator ride. Perhaps interface consistency and lack of context switching is the best approach.

I&rsquo;d guess that most people don&rsquo;t think much about different interfaces and context switching until someone points the problem out to them. Perhaps that makes them a good elevator pitch. What do you think?</p>
