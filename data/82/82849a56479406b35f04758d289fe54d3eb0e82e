Apple today provided the release candidate (RC) version of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a> 26.3 update to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-releases-macos-tahoe-26-3-beta-3/">launch of the third beta</a>. The RC is the version of &zwnj;macOS Tahoe&zwnj; 26.3 that will be provided to the public as long as the final testing phase uncovers no major bugs.   <br/>
