Apple customers afraid of massive price hikes because of tariffs helped Apple's device sales during the fiscal third quarter of 2025, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> said today.<br/>

Speaking to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/apple-crushes-wall-street-expectations-iphone-sales-soar-2025-07-31">Reuters</a></em>, Cook said that approximately one percentage point of Apple's 10 percent sales growth in Q3 2025 can be attributed to customers buying more products to get ahead of tariffs.<br/>
<br/>
"We saw evidence in the early part of the quarter, specifically, of some pull-ahead related to the tariff announcements," Cook said.<br/>
<br/>
When U.S. President Donald Trump first announced tariffs in April, there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/04/2300-dollar-iphone/">were reports</a> suggesting that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> prices could increase significantly as a result, going as high as &#36;2,300. Customers who were worried about higher prices opted to make a purchase before the tariffs went into effect.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that Apple incurred &#36;800 million in tariff related costs in the June quarter, and it expects &#36;1.1 billion in tariff costs in the September quarter if the current tariffs do not change and if no new tariffs are added.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/apple-q3-sales-tariff-boost/">Apple&#039;s Q3 Sales Boosted by Consumers Scrambling to Beat Tariff Price Hikes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-q3-sales-boosted-by-consumers-scrambling-to-beat-tariff-price-hikes.2462566/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
