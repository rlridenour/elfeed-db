It leverages FFI and run-program nicely to get the job done.</p><p>I think run-program or equivalent is amazingly handy at getting quick CL access to outside functionality.</p><p>I ran a busy website that used imagemagick a lot, but I never bothered to use FFI. I called &ldquo;convert&rdquo; and friends via run-program, and it had the advantage that incorrect use of the C API never crashed my CL session.</p><p>run-program is not particularly fast, but for my application (and many others) it can be fast enough.</p>
