<p>My feelings heading into WWDC next week are mixed. With the rest of the industry rocketing forward with artificial intelligence innovation, it feels like Apple is stuck in the starting blocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Something that does make me feel hopeful for next week, however, is the increasing evidence of a new user interface across all the Apple platforms. It looks to be something akin to what they did with visionOS. This is an opportunity for Apple to show its design muscle and just how good they are at making a delightful interface. Sebastiaan de With, who formerly worked at Apple, <a href="https://www.lux.camera/physicality-the-new-age-of-ui/?__readwiseLocation=">wrote an excellent article</a> breaking down his thoughts and ideas around what that could mean. I hope he’s right.</p>
