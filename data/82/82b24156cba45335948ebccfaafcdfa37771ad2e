<p>Iran has partially eased a communications shutdown by allowing some mobile users to place international calls, after several days in which both internet access and international calling were cut amid nationwide protests and a security crackdown. Multiple outlets report the internet remained largely disconnected from the outside world, with texting also still unavailable in many accounts. Journalists and residents described the restored calls as a limited but meaningful lifeline for families trying to check on loved ones, even as reports of heavy security and deaths continued.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DtiS7KXZrAcNP4j27Udy_BNkyYX9UI2Y3JJb8tg0TZf8raW5nMnaDhkwXI3ZCpIp5oacSpeHQnstuv80o2R2LI_1yAJGesGhqUDqLAx265CsT8PBcEHsVm2rrM0Z4lNCb_zEZQk0gHZ15xowUJ6MEn443wT_gBeu5Z4YhW8nhsi99t00S87lej2n9lU-jxbyz679RwgYl4NGg5UuNtGZz3DetbBG5pBBKjC2pCpBWjU2z8XZRPDRKypapqWC3oUlyU_tpAwuxtBa' alt='' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>One-way calling: Several residents said people inside Iran could call abroad, but callers outside Iran often could not reach them.</li><li>Local-only access: Witnesses described access to some government-approved websites while international internet services stayed unreachable.</li><li>Messaging still down: Reports noted SMS text messaging appeared to remain disabled as the broader restrictions continued.</li><li>Crackdown toll: Activists cited by multiple outlets said the death toll from the crackdown had reached at least 646 people.</li><li>Security presence: In early calls to relatives abroad, people described heavy security conditions and some damage in parts of the country.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iranian residents (witness accounts): People described a partial reopening that allows outbound international calls, while inbound calls, SMS, and full internet access remain constrained, with only limited local connectivity reported.
