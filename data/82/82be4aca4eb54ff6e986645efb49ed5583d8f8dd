Apple is still planning to launch the smarter, more capable version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> in 2026, the company told <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/apple-stock-worst-day-ftc-siri.html">CNBC</a></em> today. Apple's statement comes just a day after <em>Bloomberg</em> reported Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/">is having issues</a> with the updated version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, leading to potential delays of the feature.<br/>

Apple initially intended to launch the Apple Intelligence-powered version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in spring 2025, but right around when a debut was expected in March 2025, Apple said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">Siri wasn't ready</a> and needed more time. Later in the year, Apple said that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-says-personalized-siri-was-working/">would launch its Siri update</a> in 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Though Apple never gave a timeline more specific than "2026," <em>Bloomberg</em> said the company was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/">aiming to include Siri</a> in iOS 26.4, an update planned for spring 2026. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s latest report suggests the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality will not be ready in time to be included in iOS 26.4, so the new features could be pushed to iOS 26.5 or iOS 27.<br/>
<br/>
Apple may miss its internal target for the 2026 &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; launch, but since the company never publicly gave timing beyond 2026, there's no actual delay yet. Apple has until December 2026 to launch &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; within the timeframe that it promised in summer of 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Back in June 2024, Apple previewed three new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features, including onscreen awareness, personal context, and the ability to do more in and between apps. Apple has since started working on additional &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features like image generation and a tool for searching the web.<br/>
<br/>
In Apple's testing, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; apparently sometimes doesn't process queries properly, and can take too long to respond to requests. Features are not working as intended, so &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s new capabilities could roll out across several updates. We could still get one or two new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features in iOS 26.4, with other features set to come in future updates slated for 2026. There are still several <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> updates planned for 2026, and iOS 27 will launch in September 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Apple provided <em>CNBC</em> with a statement because the company's stock dropped five percent today, both due to the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; delay rumors and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/12/tim-cook-faces-ftc-warning-apple-news/">FTC scrutiny over Apple News</a>.<br/>

Apple is likely to release the first beta of iOS 26.4 later this month, giving us more insight into the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; launch situation.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/12/siri-ios-26-launch-confirmed-apple/">Apple Confirms Revamped Siri is Still Coming in 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-revamped-siri-is-still-coming-in-2026.2477617/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
