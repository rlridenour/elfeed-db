<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A bit of a walk about through digital neighborhood: as analogue, specific, and digressive.  Or, a reflection on the written word in many forms.

<p><small>This post started from an email exchange with <a href="https://tracydurnell.com">Tracy Durnell</a>.  It’s sat in my
drafts folder for more than two months, and a bit of insomnia paired with
indigestion, was enough to prod me into wrapping it up, and releasing it into
the world.</small></p>
</aside>

<p>With <em>enshitification</em> screaming onto the scene in <time datetime="2024" title="2024">2024</time> and social media platforms
revealing their asses (from which the shit pours); there’s an ongoing call to
own your online “home base.”  That is a website or blog.  I agree with that
sentiment, but want to take a different angle.</p>
<p>Namely, a stroll from my “digital home” through my “digital neighborhood.”  That
is to put some shape and form to what can be ephemeral.  Let’s start by creating
some mental images.</p>
<h2 id="visualizing-my-neighborhood">Visualizing My Neighborhood</h2>
<p>In this neighborhood, I live amongst owners and renters; each in their own
abode.  Some of these abodes fade, perhaps abandoned, becoming almost entirely
invisible.  But sometimes they spark back alive, with their occupants again
going out and about in <del>my</del> our neighborhood.</p>
<p>From my abode, I write my private thoughts.  Some of those, I’ll turn into
letters that I read aloud from my front porch for all who have chosen to gather
near.  There’s recording of what I read, which others might later hear.</p>
<p>I don’t allow others to respond to my reading on the front porch.  Instead, I
encourage them to drop something in my mailbox or go ahead and speak from their
front porch, hoping that I’ll hear them.</p>
<p>Also from my abode, I read my newspaper.  This is something that I’ve assembled
over time; a list of addresses of folks who are speaking from their front porch
and whom I might want to hear.  I add a few notes about the speakers, sometimes
saying “this person is provisional” and others are “I will read everything they
write.”  This helps me tend to that list of addresses.</p>
<p>I’ll review this list every so often, and by happenstance Craig Maloney’s is the
first in that list.  I always smile and tear up in fond memory of a person I
never met, but whom lived and shared an admirable life.</p>
<p>In my abode, I also look to the mailbox to see if folks are writing me letters.
I love receiving these letters, either inquiring about a post or sharing their
response.  We have a slow conversation and sometimes I might ask them if I can
use our conversation for a porch reading.</p>
<p>Leaving the front-porch, I journey out.  This is different.  I’m looking for
more casual conversations; those serendipitous moments where one might talk with
a stranger sitting beside you on public transportation.  I don’t talk with
everyone I see on the street; even those that I’ve talked with before.  My day
out is instead a time for me to engage in that small talk in which something
more might spark.</p>
<p>While out, I also take notice if they are sharing their personal “business card”
and if they look to have broad interests, I might add them to my newspaper list.
Or very specific interests.  It depends on my whim.  I’ll try to scratch a few
notes on that business card to help me remember.</p>
<p>I’m also viewing these conversations as ephemeral.  While recorded, I don’t
“own” those recording.  I can’t reproduce what I’ve said.  And that’s fine.  If
I want to reproduce something, I’ll go back home and write up my thoughts and
share them from my front-porch.</p>
<p>The beauty of walking through my neighborhood, is that folks can’t help but walk
around with their “tags” on display.  It’s as though everyone’s bought a new
outfit, didn’t cut off the tags, and thus shows where to find what they’re
wearing and sharing.</p>
<p>And I take notice.  I might see an interesting tag, such as #libraries, or the
address of someone’s shared thoughts, even a bit of a summary to let me know what
they too are sharing.  I use those to add to my newspaper sources.</p>
<p>I think about that newspaper, I’ve set it up such that my computer saves all of
those clippings.  And I can find them later.  I have also set it up so I can
easily reference those clippings; in private thoughts or in sharing.</p>
<h2 id="a-digressive-technical-overview">A Digressive Technical Overview</h2>
<p>I have a personal website: <a href="https://takeonrules.com">https://takeonrules.com</a>.  I “own” it.  Served from a
<span>Virtual Private Server</span> (<abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Virtual Private Server”" title="Other site-wide references of “Virtual Private Server”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-VPS">&#128214;</a></small>)
.  In years past, I “rented” my site by hosting on Github and prior to that
in Wordpress.</p>
<p>I’ve consistently written on my blog since <time datetime="2011-02-03" title="2011-02-03">February 2, 2011</time>.  Of late, I’ve
written more per year, which means I keep flicking the lights back on.</p>
<p>I write daily journal entries and draft my thoughts via <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
.  All starting on
my local file system.  From those local files, I pluck and publish posts from
journal entries and other thoughts.</p>
<p>To read my newspapers I load my <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" title="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-RSS">&#128214;</a></small>

 While
visiting, I might capture quotes into my journal.<small class="side-container">

</small>
 I might also head over to
my Mastodon timeline and read what others are thinking, sharing, and saying.</p>
<p>I cherish those moments when I read an <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>
 feed item, and see that as part of
that feed item the author has included means of contacting them: a link to their
email.  I’ll sometimes take a bit to write them an email.  And we’ll engage in a
bit of back and forth.</p>
<p>Also, I identify any <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>
 feed entry that does not provide the full text.  And
those live in provisional status.  My reflexes are to ask “there’s lots of
full-text feeds, why bother with this truncation?”</p>
<p>Why?  Because I’m sick of click bait, and I’m curating my <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>
 feed to avoid
click bait.  That is to not give time nor space to the practice of hinting at
something, and requiring further action to get that something.  Especially when
that action is surveilled with more computational processing cycles than we ever
spent getting to the moon.</p>
<p>Once a week or so, someone will send me an email.  One person recently
reached out regarding 
, we exchanged a few
emails, sharing our love of Tolkien and table-top role-playing.  But diving into
far more.</p>
<p>Going on a walk about, is me reading Mastodon or spending time to <a href="https://indieblog.page/">Discover the
IndieWeb, one blog post at a time.</a>  It’s a more casual activity, one where I’m
hoping for serendipity.</p>
<p>Most all of this I do from my laptop.</p>
<h3 id="wherefore-art-thou-smart-phone">Wherefore Art Thou Smart Phone?</h3>
<p>I do have a “smart” phone, but I don’t have a convenient means on it of reading
my <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>
 feed; things I read on my “smart” phone are to easily misplaced and
forgotten.  And my writing capabilities are anemic on that “smart” phone.</p>
<p>I accept the limitations of my “smart” phone.  And instead have thought of it
differently.  I don’t need nor expect it to be a mobile proxy for my laptop.
Instead, I treat that “smart” phone as though all conversations on it are as
though I were talking on it…with a caveat.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> For awhile, I thought I needed Google Maps on my phone.  But I’ve removed it
and instead rely on reviewing a map before I go mobile.  Along the way, I might
pull up an offline copy of a map to help orient.  I’ve found this all more
mentally stimulating.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>I have started a private notes file on my phone; here I’ll write a sentence or
two of what I consider to be opening sentences for paragraphs of different
novels that may be rattling in my brain.</p>
<p>Treating these notes something similar to Borges’s review of a novel he had
published; except Borges never published a novel and the review was what
satisfied his desire to publish said novel.<small class="side-container">

</small>
</p>
<p>I’ve also tried audio recording of my thoughts, but those are even less
memorable, easily forgettable, consuming more space, and eventually being
purged.  Were those spoken words transcribed, I might find greater “use”.  But I
don’t have those “services” enabled on my phone, and relative to their cost, I
don’t think I’d get much “value.”</p>
<p>I’ll just scratch something on paper, or send a text to myself.</p>
<h3 id="overlaying-digital-and-analogue-neighborhoods">Overlaying Digital and Analogue Neighborhoods</h3>
<p>While living this digital networked life, I also likely have three to seven
paper books that are in my “I’m currently reading them” mental space.</p>
<p>For example, I’m currently “reading” (or perhaps considering continuing
“reading”):</p>
<ul>
<li><cite data-id="87f4018e-a675-44a7-9c95-b1183384affd">The Dispossessed</cite> by Ursula K. Le Guin</li>
<li><cite data-id="works-don-quixote">Don Quixote</cite> by Miguel Cervantes</li>
<li><cite data-id="f9b083b9-1531-45f3-9b87-d0df0f6c3ac8">Use of Weapons</cite> by Iain M. Banks</li>
<li><cite data-id="C34F6133-45F8-4495-8D23-0407FD322510">Orwell’s Roses</cite> by Rebecca Solnit</li>
<li><cite data-id="2780cea5-fbca-4c36-8b87-842398e476f2">Résistance</cite> by Agnès Humbert</li>
<li><cite data-id="32E68B73-F3F0-49AA-A3FF-81F99F317BF7">The Ultimate Hidden Truth of the World…</cite> by David Graeber</li>
</ul>
<p>I suspect that one never finishes <cite data-id="works-don-quixote">Don Quixote</cite> by Miguel Cervantes; even if you
turn the last page having read all of the words.  As it continues living with
you, and you with it, joining Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and Cervantes as yet
another layer.</p>
<p>A favorite moment recently was reading a mass market paperback copy of <cite data-id="BAEA3D15-DA6C-4699-9DCC-3F424B515740">We</cite> by Yevgeny Zamyatin.  The significance of mass market, was that it could fit in my
breast pocket.  So I carried that little book around and read a short-chapter
here or there.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> I learned that the mass market paperback form was developed so that a book
could fit in a World War 1 soldier’s breast pocket.  A technological means that
fit in one’s pocket, for helping them disassociate from the horrors of the
moment.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>I also keep my poetry collection close by (on the shelves near my bed), grabbing
and reading one in those interstitial moments.</p>
<p>I spent a half-hour one evening tumbling through <cite data-id="d1653e24-3255-483d-a234-940dc8cf0b9e">Borges</cite> by Jorge Luis Borges.  There’s some relation between poetry and the quote, often
attributed to Mark Twain of: “If I had more time, I would have written a shorter
letter.”<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> See <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/28/shorter-letter/">Quote Origin: If I Had More Time, I Would Have Written a Shorter Letter
– Quote Investigator®</a>.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>In the cases of those paper books, I almost always have pen or pencil ready, to
mark and annotate; to discuss with the book.  This slows the reading, but
enlivens and enriches the activity.</p>
<p>Having these analogue writings near, both physically and in my subconscious, is
another strategy for serendipity.  Of making connections across time and space.</p>
<h3 id="email-newsletters-one-short-step-from-the-dustbin">Email Newsletters…One Short Step from the Dustbin</h3>
<p>And last, and definitely least of these, are the email lists; too important to
unsubscribe, but ones that I constantly lament how they could’ve been in my <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>

feed.</p>
<p>I don’t want to read an email that could’ve been a “blog post”.  Especially one
loaded with tracking pixels and surveillance.  But there are a few folks who are
writing important (to me) things and what they have available is of that nature.</p>
<p>But, <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>
 has been asphyxiated by those who wish to steward an algorithm of what
they present to you.  Where I want to walk my local environs, the asphyxiation
is analogous to highways (and sidewalks) cutting that landscape; implying where
I can go.</p>
<p>Let me be blunt:</p>
<ul>
<li>I treasure personalized emails</li>
<li>I struggle to find “value” in most email newsletter; they feel wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I wonder, is my mental model of email one of paper and envelopes?  An
envelope that has hand-written address information will spark my interest.  And
does these newsletters, via email, remind me of getting a bill?  Or junk mail?
Or a catalog from a company I once ordered from?</p>
<p>Regardless, I hold little patience for “news platforms” that distribute only via
email.  Give me an <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>
 feed in which I need to provide authorization
information, and I’ll keep reading.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>“Owning” my digital abode brings me a sense of pride and contentedness.  It has
enriched my literary, professional, and thinking life.</p>
<p>I’m thankful for my past decisions to prioritize the time to establish that
ownership.  I write and share, in part, to pay forward some of what I have
experienced as possible and conceivable.</p>
