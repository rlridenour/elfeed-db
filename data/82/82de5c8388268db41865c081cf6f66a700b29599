A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13330">piping Eshell output to a buffer</a>. It&rsquo;s a cute trick but it only works in Eshell. It turns out you can do better.

iLemming has a video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVlF3-KyqvY">piping in and out of an Emacs buffer even in a normal shell</a>. He begins by showing how to accomplish <i>input</i> redirection within Eshell. That&rsquo;s not supported by Eshell itself so it requires a supporting eshell function—that iLemming calls <code>b</code>​—to work.

The real juice of the video is making this work in a normal—that is, non-Eshell— shell. That requires another function, <a href="https://github.com/agzam/mx-piper/blob/main/README.org">mxp</a>, this time <a href="https://github.com/agzam/mx-piper/blob/main/mxp">a shell script</a>. If you watch the video or follow the mxp link, you&rsquo;ll see several examples of mxp in use. It&rsquo;s really quite flexible.

All of this clever and the code is worth taking a look at to see how you might do this type of thing. Still, I don&rsquo;t see how I would use this capability. I could probably make up some fake application for it but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine any realistic use. Of course, that&rsquo;s probably due to my lack of imagination and I&rsquo;m sure some of you will jump in to educate me.</p>
