<p>Hell of a scoop from Mark Gurman, at Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The next Apple operating systems will be identified by year,
rather than with a version number, according to people with
knowledge of the matter. That means the current iOS 18 will give
way to “iOS 26,” said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the plan is still private. Other updates will be known as
iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26.</p>

<p>Apple is making the change to bring consistency to its branding
and move away from an approach that can be confusing to customers
and developers. Today’s operating systems — including iOS 18,
watchOS 12, macOS 15 and visionOS 2 — use different numbers
because their initial versions didn’t debut at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that they’re on a consistent annual schedule, this supposed new version-numbering scheme makes a lot of sense. It’ll certainly be helpful to anyone trying to figure out what’s up-to-date or not, and it’ll make writing about older OSes much easier. Presuming Gurman is right, this is going to seem really weird at first, and then very quickly seem very natural.</p>

<p>One of the true oddities of Apple’s OS version numbering is that because they stuck with “10” as the leading digit of MacOS’s version numbering from Mac OS X 10.0 “Cheetah”<sup id="fnr1-2025-05-28"><a href="#fn1-2025-05-28">1</a></sup> (2001) through MacOS 10.15 “Catalina” (2019), before finally turning the dial to 11 with MacOS 11 “Big Sur” (2020), a casual observer would presume that iOS (currently at 18.5) is older than MacOS (currently at 15.5) when in fact it’s the other way around.</p>
