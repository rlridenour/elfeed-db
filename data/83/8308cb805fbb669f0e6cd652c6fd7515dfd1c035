<p>hey,</p>
<p>I currently use Windows machine but I do programming inside Linux virtual machine and
inside MacOS driven laptop (some iOS specific stuff) which is in the same room where I am and connected to the local network.</p>
<p>Since I develop in Vim I use SSH connection to run Vim instance directly on MacOS machine.
If I need anything graphical (like Xcode) I use VNC client.</p>
<h2 id="issue">Issue</h2>
<p>SSH connection is super non-stable. It&rsquo;s pretty painful to use Vim with very slow connection. If I try to ping my MacOS laptop
I can see clearly some ping spikes. Usual ICMP travel time is about 3ms but sometimes I get 700ms or 1000ms. Insane.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Based on <a href="https://symless.com/forums/topic/5902-workaround-macos-wifi-ping-spikes/">this found</a>
it is probably related to WiFi card power saving features.</p>
<p>To prevent it you can use this command (inside MacOS machine)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ping -q -n -s 0 -i 0.1 192.168.0.1 # you can ping any (real) address basically
</code></pre><p>What this ping command does is just keeping your WiFi card busy all the time.</p>
<p>Please note, you have to keep this command running all the time. You can probably create some kind of background script
but I just use alias which I run when I&rsquo;m connected to my Mac. Otherwise I don&rsquo;t want to overload my home network.</p>
