ChatGPT Go provides expanded access to ChatGPT's latest model, GPT‑5.2 Instant, with 10× more messages, file uploads, and image creation allowed compared to the free tier. ChatGPT Go also offers longer memory than the free tier, so that ChatGPT can remember more information about you for a longer period.<br/>
<br/>
ChatGPT now offers <a href="https://chatgpt.com/pricing">three subscription tiers</a> worldwide:<ul><br/>
  <li><strong>ChatGPT Go:</strong> &#36;8/month</li><br/>
  <li><strong>ChatGPT Plus:</strong> &#36;20/month</li><br/>
  <li><strong>ChatGPT Pro:</strong> &#36;200/month</li></ul>ChatGPT's more advanced GPT‑5.2 Thinking model still requires ChatGPT Plus or ChatGPT Pro, for tasks that require deeper reasoning.<br/>
<br/>
ChatGPT Go was already available in India and select other countries.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI also announced that it plans to <a href="https://openai.com/index/our-approach-to-advertising-and-expanding-access/">begin testing ads</a> in both the free and ChatGPT Go tiers with logged-in adult users in the U.S. in the coming weeks. ChatGPT Plus and Pro will remain ad-free, as will  ChatGPT Business and ChatGPT Enterprise.<br/>
<br/>
To start, OpenAI plans to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there is a relevant sponsored product or service based on the current conversation. Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the answer. Users will be able to learn more about why they are seeing a particular ad, and any ad can be dismissed.<br/>

OpenAI said ads will not influence the organic answers that ChatGPT gives users, and it ensured that conversations with ChatGPT will be kept private from advertisers, and that it will never sell user data to advertisers. OpenAI also promised there will always be at least one paid ChatGPT subscription tier available that is ad-free.<br/>
<br/>
Ads are not eligible to appear in ChatGPT conversations involving sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health, or politics, according to OpenAI.<br/>
<br/>
"Ads support our commitment to making AI accessible to everyone by helping us keep ChatGPT available at free and affordable price points," said OpenAI.<br/>
<br/>
"We'll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won't change," it added.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/16/chatgpt-go-now-available-worldwide/">ChatGPT Introduces Lower-Priced Subscription Tier, Ads Coming Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chatgpt-introduces-lower-priced-subscription-tier-ads-coming-soon.2476144/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
