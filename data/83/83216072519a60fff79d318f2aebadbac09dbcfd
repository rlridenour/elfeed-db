<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> adds a new feature that lets you know how long it'll take your battery to charge when it's plugged in or on a wireless charger, with the new option allowing you to better optimize your charging practices.<br/>

You'll be able to determine how fast a charger is charging your device based on the estimated time to a full charge. If you're charging from a slow connection or a Qi-based charger limited to 5W, the setting will let you know that you're connected to a slow charger.<br/>
<br/>
You can see the time remaining until a full charge in the Battery section of the Settings app. Apple doesn't appear to have added a new widget for the feature as of yet, but it could come in the future. You will see the estimated time remaining for charging on your Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
An estimate of the time it takes a device to charge used to be available on the Mac, but Apple removed it long ago.<br/>
