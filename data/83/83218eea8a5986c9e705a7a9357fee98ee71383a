The playlist, called "Replay All Time," expands on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>'s existing Replay features. Previously, users could only see their top songs for each individual calendar year that they've been subscribed to &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, but now, Replay All Time shows a comprehensive list of the top 100 songs across all subscriber years. Since &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; has now been available for a decade, long-standing &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscribers will be able to get a picture of their long-term listening habits for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Replay All Time appears in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Home tab and will continue to be updated dynamically updated based on the user's full listening history.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-music-debuts-all-new-personalized-playlist/">Apple Music Debuts All-New Personalized Playlist</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-debuts-all-new-personalized-playlist.2459926/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
