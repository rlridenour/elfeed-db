<p>The mesmerizing video above lets you visualize the ocean currents around the world. Using data from spacecraft, buoys, and other measurements, the visualization shows the ocean in motion, with the currents creating Van Gogh-like swirls around the globe.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/oceans/going-with-the-flow-visualizing-ocean-currents-with-ecco/">NASA</a>, “the ocean has been [historically] difficult to model. Scientists struggled in years past to simulate ocean currents or accurately predict fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and other properties. As a result, models of ocean dynamics rapidly diverged from reality, which meant they could only provide useful information for brief periods.” This all changed, however, when NASA and other partners developed <a href="https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/projects/ecco/">ECCO</a>, short for “Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean.” “By applying the laws of physics to data from multiple satellites and thousands of floating sensors, NASA scientists and their collaborators built ECCO to be a realistic, detailed, and continuous ocean model that spans decades.” “The project provides models that are the best possible reconstruction of the past 30 years of the global ocean. It allows us to understand the ocean’s physical processes at scales that are not normally observable.” Watch above as years of ocean data come to life in a crisp, compelling visualization.</p>
