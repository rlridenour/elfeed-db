<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-releases-ios-26-2-1/">Alongside iOS 26.2.1</a>, Apple today released an updated version of iOS 12 for devices that are still running that operating system update, eight years after the software was first released.<br/>

iOS 12.5.8 is available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 5s and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6, meaning Apple is continuing to support these devices for 13 and 12 years after launch, respectively. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5s came out in September 2013, while the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 launched in September 2014.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes for the update, iOS 12.5.8 extends the certificate required for features like iMessage, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and device activation, so they will continue to work after January 2027.<br/>
<br/>
Originally, certificate-limited functions like device activation would have ceased when the certificate expired, but now key features on the two older iPhones will continue to work in the years to come.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to now, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5s and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 last received software updates in January 2023, when Apple released important security fixes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-iphone-security-updates-five-year-minimum/">has publicly committed</a> to providing a minimum of five years of security updates for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from the time that it launches, but it often offers vulnerability fixes for an even longer period of time.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6s, for example, was released 11 years ago, but it received a security update in September 2025 with the launch of iOS 15.8.5. The device received an iOS 15.8.6 update just today, adding the same certificate extension.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also released new versions of iOS 18 and iOS 16.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/iphone-5s-software-update/">iPhone 5s Gets New Software Update 13 Years After Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-5s-gets-new-software-update-13-years-after-launch.2476689/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
