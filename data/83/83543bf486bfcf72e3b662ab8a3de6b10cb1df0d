<p>My artistic productivity has gone off the cliff in recent times..</p>
<p>I am in pursuit of some other priorities to try and make my life a little more stable. A little bit of sacrifice now for the greater good but honestly it feels pretty gross to not be doing art stuff. It&rsquo;s probably the first time in my life that I&rsquo;ve almost put a full stop on things.</p>
<p>I even got a new drawing tablet - a screen tablet that I will discuss setting up on <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> in future posts. I figured it would be an &lsquo;in my face&rsquo; commitment that would get me back into art habits. Even that has not really been enough to make any serious work - just a little play and practice.</p>
<p>When I do get back to posting work I&rsquo;m primarily using <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a> for my art &lsquo;portfolio&rsquo; of sorts. I don&rsquo;t use Instagram as I hate all the Meta stuff. Pixelfed seems like my best option for posting images right now. It definitely has a little way to go as an &lsquo;app&rsquo; but I think it&rsquo;s going to stick around and has good ethics. I particularly like that you can set up a portfolio/gallery type page. You can see that <a href="https://portfolio.pixelfed.social/bledley">here</a> or through my profile at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also removed a ton of old stuff from my blog, of course I still have the files locally it just feels like time to wipe the slate clean and think about how to go forwards.</p>
<p>Including above some rough around the edges study stuff in <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a>.</p>
