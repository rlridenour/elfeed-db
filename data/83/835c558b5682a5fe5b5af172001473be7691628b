<hr>
<p>I’ve been walking past our spare room for three months now, carefully not looking at the bed frame parts (the now dusty, bed frame parts) leaning against the wall.</p>
<p>The task of setting up this bed would sit in the <em>important but not urgent</em> quadrant of an Eisenhower matrix. This means that nothing will happen if I don’t do it today, but I’ll regret not doing it sooner when someone needs a place to stay over (a likely scenario). It’s been easy to put it out of my mind. I tend to nod at it as I go by, saying<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Later”.</p>
<p>But then I came across <a href="https://ellanew.com/2023/05/15/ptpl-052-advice-for-people-who-cant-stick-to-lists" title="wikilink">an old post</a> meant precisely for times like this.</p>
<p>Here’s the advice I gave back then:</p>
<p><em>Sometimes you have to get to the bottom of the issue or issues that, system or no system, are keeping you from attacking your tasks with gusto.</em></p>
<p><em>For each item on your list, ask—</em></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>Do you have the necessary knowledge and tools to complete the task?</em></li>
<li><em>Is this a project or task that really needs to be done?</em></li>
<li><em>If you find yourself not wanting to do it, why is that?</em></li>
<li><em>Keep asking<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>why?” until you get to the real reason hiding underneath all the other reasons</em></li>
<li><em>Can you clearly visualise what successfully completing the task will look like? What feelings does that vision bring up?</em></li>
<li><em>Which of your core values lie at the foundation of this task?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>It was interesting to observe how strongly I didn’t want to apply those questions to this task. My thought process:<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Pffft! <em>I</em> don’t need to answer these. I don’t want to waste my time. They don’t even apply here. Just, No.”</p>
<p>It took real effort to make myself do the exercise but I’m very glad I pushed through.</p>
<p>Here are my answers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Yes</li>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>I have more important things to do right now, it’s easier to shut the door</li>
<li>Because putting the bed frame together is heavy work and I don’t feel like doing heavy work / Because I don’t like how I feel when I go in that room / Because I’m ashamed the room looks uncared for / Because I think people are thinking I’m incompetent or lazy / Because I’m assuming that others’ opinions reflect reality / Because I’ve forgotten that it’s okay to be human and that no one else’s opinion changes who I really am</li>
<li>The room will finally look nice, I’ll be able to leave the door open without being ashamed of what’s inside. It’ll feel good to know I can have people stay over at a moment’s notice.</li>
<li>Family and Friends: I do my best to create a peaceful, welcoming atmosphere in my home, and to show the important people in my life that I care about them / Service: I willingly give of my time and means to help improve my community and the lives of those around me</li>
</ol>
<p>Wow. That was actually a significant, powerful exercise! (Like, really. I’m writing this in stages, as I go through the process.)</p>
<p>Preparing the guest bed is on my Today list for the fiftieth time, and right now it feels like I’ll actually get it done. The most powerful question for me was number 6. Connecting the task to two of my core values is really helping me to feel the<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>why’ behind the job.</p>
<p>— ⏳ —</p>
<p>On my way to start setting up the bed, the resistance returned. But it had no power over me! I could finally see it for what it was: a multi-layered story I’d been telling myself, that wasn’t actually true.</p>
<p>Part way through putting up the bed I had to ask for help, so the answer to question 1 (above) was actually a No.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many tasks are like that.</p>
<p>Finding out you don’t have the skills and the tools you thought you did is a fact, not a judgment. You are the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>project manager” of every task you allow onto your list, and good project managers adjust their workflow — and seek help — when challenges arise.</p>
<p>The big takeaway from this is that <strong>no app or system can take away the emotional resistance you’re feeling toward a task</strong>. Acknowledging that resistance and letting it speak has to come first.</p>
<p>This week, pick one task from your list that you keep putting off, and see what those six questions can help you learn about it (and learn about yourself).</p>
