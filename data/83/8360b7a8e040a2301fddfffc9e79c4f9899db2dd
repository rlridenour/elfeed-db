Netflix has quietly removed the ability to cast content from its mobile apps to most modern TVs and streaming devices, including newer Chromecast models and the Google TV Streamer.<br/>

The change was first spotted by users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1ox7in3/rant_netflix_no_long_has_casting_support_you_must/">Reddit</a> and confirmed in an updated <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/58351">Netflix support page</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/netflix-casting-chromecast-google-tv-streamer-3620784/">Android Authority</a></em>), which now states that the streaming service no longer supports casting from mobile devices to most TVs and TV-streaming devices. Users are instead directed to use the remote that came with their TV hardware and use its native Netflix app.<br/>
<br/>
The only exception appears to apply to older Chromecast models without remotes, as well as TVs with built-in Google Cast support. However, even on these legacy devices, casting only remains for those on costlier ad-free plans, but it is unavailable for subscribers on Netflix's ad-supported plan.<br/>
<br/>
User reports appear to suggest Netflix began removing the Cast button from its mobile apps in mid-November, but the company provided no advance warning to users. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chromecast/comments/1ox7in3/comment/nrbhp1q/">One Reddit user</a> said customer service explained that devices with remotes can no longer cast, claiming the decision was made to improve the customer experience.<br/>

The move bears similarities to Netflix's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/05/netflix-app-no-longer-supports-airplay/">2019 decision</a> to remove AirPlay support from its iOS app, citing an inability to distinguish between different AirPlay-enabled devices (i.e., what is an ‌Apple TV‌ vs. what isn't) as Apple expanded the technology to third-party TVs.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/netflix-kills-casting-from-mobile-app-to-tvs/">Netflix Kills Casting From Its Mobile App to Most Modern TVs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-kills-casting-from-its-mobile-app-to-most-modern-tvs.2473277/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
