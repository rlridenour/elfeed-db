<p>Taiwan says it has reached a “general consensus” with the United States on the terms of a new trade deal, after talks that began in April following President Trump’s tariff action on Taiwanese exports. The negotiations were triggered after the US imposed a 32% tariff that was later reduced to 20%, and Taiwan has been seeking further relief—particularly to avoid added costs on key exports such as semiconductors. Taiwan’s trade office said both sides are now discussing the schedule for a concluding meeting, with a public announcement planned once that timing is confirmed. US media reports cited in coverage say the emerging package could lower US tariffs to 15% in exchange for additional investment commitments from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), a sign both sides see practical upside in stabilizing this high-value economic relationship.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/AVeDuD-hMsRNCXkeq2HcRRazVZ6C9S-B_3KitxqgrNRmj1fNcqJqQ1Ox3gkecBJc1EapBG2MCTov8Y5ehzm5tw3UMwUwSzyWV9oq7r61CK-dmZgV9GjSj1hqSXkNcQQcp-NK0ezCc8qWZVt4fjZ7WuvEOLLWrjGpD-jhdsTArFATNgEXLYYOlykehGYW_qsN3ws7HsgCRwuGEvw' alt='Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te in a recent address (image used in coverage).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Next-step meeting: Taiwan’s Office of Trade Negotiations said it is coordinating a final meeting schedule with the US, and it will announce details once confirmed.</li><li>Investment pledge: President Lai Ching-te has pledged to boost Taiwanese investment in the United States as part of the effort to reduce trade levies and deepen economic ties.</li><li>Defense spending: Lai has also pledged to increase Taiwan’s defense spending, a parallel policy signal as Taipei manages economic negotiations and regional security concerns.</li><li>Chip focus: Taiwanese authorities described semiconductors as central to both economies, and said chip-export issues featured in the trade dispute shaping the talks.</li><li>TSMC linkage: Coverage citing US media reports said tariff reductions would be tied to additional TSMC investment, underlining how supply-chain security and industrial strategy intersect with trade policy.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Taiwan government (Office of Trade Negotiations): Taiwan says it has reached a “general consensus” with the US and is working out a concluding meeting schedule before making an announcement.
