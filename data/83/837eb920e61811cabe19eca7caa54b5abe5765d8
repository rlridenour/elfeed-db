<p>Recently I wanted to print disassembled main funciton of the program to the file
so I can read it in my Emacs, but it turned out I can&rsquo;t simply redirect the GDB output
to the file with <code>disassemble main &gt; main.asm</code> command in gdb command line.</p>
<p>But there is <code>-ex</code> option exists in gdb command so we can execute some gdb commands
right after gdb is initialized.</p>
<p>Looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>gdb &lt;file&gt; -ex <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;disassemble main&#39;</span> -ex <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;quit&#39;</span> &gt; main.asm
</span></span></code></pre></div><br/>
As you can see we can chain multiple commands. It's important to have `quit` as the last one
to make sure we exit GDB.
