Apple considered introducing a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> feature that would dynamically re-arrange apps on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>.<br/>

The detail emerged in a report last week from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-deal-apples-craig-federighi-plots-cautious-course-ai"><em>The Information</em></a>, which said that subordinates of software chief Craig Federighi approached him with proposals for an AI-powered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;. The feature would dynamically change the locations of apps on the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; according to users' needs. Federighi reportedly rejected the idea, believing that it would disorient users, many of whom rely on knowing the fixed location of apps on their &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; for quick access.<br/>
<br/>
With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, Apple prioritized new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that included Live Translation, more powerful <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a>, ChatGPT image generation in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, and actions in Shortcuts. Broader and more capable &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features are expected to arrive later this year with iOS 27, such as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/siri-chatbot-ios-27/">Siri chatbot</a> powered by Google Gemini.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/22/new-apple-ai-strategy-firms-up/"><em>The Information</em>'s report</a> focused on how Apple restructured its artificial intelligence strategy under Federighi, accelerating plans to overhaul <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> by relying on external AI models after years of internal delays and organizational friction.<br/>
