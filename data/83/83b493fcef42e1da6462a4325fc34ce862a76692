<p>The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-ai-news-publishers-7e687141">ran an article</a>&nbsp;covering how News Sites are seeing a dramatic decrease in traffic in response to Google’s new AI tools. This shouldn’t be a surprise. AI search delivers answers without requiring the you to click on the blue links. So there’s less traffic for all Internet sources and, subsequently, less revenue.</p>



<p>That said, AI is only going to become more of a force in search. The answer is not to put the toothpaste back in the tube, but instead rethinking how we monetize content on the Internet.</p>
