<p>
She had had a case of the <i>meh</i>​s. After a little
bit of empathizing, I flung myself over her and
declared that she wasn't going anywhere, I was
just going to snuggle her. It was my evil plan. I
cackled a little, and then asked her for tips on
proper cackling. Was it "MwahaHAha, or MwaHAhaha,
or MWAhahaha?"
</p>

<p>
She said, "Meh."
</p>

<p>
I rolled with it. "Meh heh heh heh."
</p>

<p>
Ah, there, a little giggle.
</p>

<p>
I hammed it up some more. "Meh HEH heh heh heh."
More and more cackling, until she was giggling
continuously. She giggled so much that she started
hiccuping.
</p>

<p>
"You're so funny," she said between sips of
water.
</p>

<p>
That might be the only time I'll hear that from
her, so I'm immortalizing it in my blog. And yes,
correlation doesn't mean causation, and n=1
anyway, but I'm still going to take the win.

<p>
I didn't quite know what play could look like for
us, in the early days. Some parents seem to
effortlessly break out silly voices or play
pretend with toys. In the beginning, that felt
awkward, even though I'd grown up with my dad
telling captivating stories complete with sound
effects and gestures. As a new parent, I often
felt tired and my mind kept sliding away. It was
easier to let A+ take the lead, and to focus on things like <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2018/07/working-on-play/">supporting and documenting</a>. That was probably
the right call for both of our personalities. From
time to time, I come across parenting articles
that even recommend this approach of letting the
child do most of the directing. <a href="https://theeducationhub.org.nz/an-introduction-to-serve-and-return-in-early-childhood-education/">Serve and return</a>,
that's all, I just needed to keep the rhythm
going; when A+ leads, I can focus on responding. I didn't even have
to do it all the time; I could be a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-narrative-nurse-practitioner/202407/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-good-enough-parent">good-enough</a>
parent.
</p>

<p>
When A+ was interested in stacking blocks, I felt
my job was mostly to observe and narrate
appreciatively, and also to help tidy up. When she
was fascinated with the water table at the Science
Centre, my job was to bring dry clothes to change
into. When she started building with LEGO, I
helped her find pieces, but I didn't really spur
her on with build ideas or roleplaying. When she
moved on tea parties, I accepted my share of muddy
teacups and sand cupcakes. At 9, A+ mostly likes
to sing, play Minecraft, and make up stories with
me. That's something I'm more comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
I'm somewhat reassured by the Slate essay <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/03/parent-child-pretend-play-expectations.html">Playtime
Is Over!</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you meet the child on his level and mostly
watch what they’re doing instead, it’s still an
act of love and attention without being such a
draining experience.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I never quite felt comfortable staging those
playacting dramas that would probably have helped
A+ develop better social skills, like pretending
one doll has accidentally bumped another one so
that we could explore apologies and acceptance. I
probably wouldn't have been able to get it past
A+, anyway; she's pretty good at sniffing out when
I'm pretending to play instead of playing pretend.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-playfulness-resources">
<p>
I was pretty worried in the beginning. The first
six months of A+'s life were a bit of a blur, with
quite a few diagnostic exams and follow-up
appointments at Sick Kids Hospital. She went under
general anaesthesia a couple of times, so I was
extra nervous about the possible impact on her
growth.<sup><a id="fnr.anaesthesia" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.anaesthesia" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> It's hard to be playful
when you're tired and anxious. Anyway, it was just
what's got to be done, so we focused on figuring
out how to mitigate the risks by <a href="https://www.jaapos.org/article/S1091-8531(14)00493-5/fulltext#:~:text=In%20rodents%2C%20exposure%20to%20inhalant,about%20how%20to%20gain%20rewards.">enriching her
environment</a>. I applied to the <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/information-for-healthcare-professionals/patient-referrals/healthy-babies-healthy-children-hbhc-program/">Healthy Babies
Healthy Children</a> program, and we got approved. We
regularly met with a nurse and a home visitor who
helped us keep track of A+'s development,
suggested relevant activities, and gave me
feedback on my interactions with A+. (<a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2017/06/notes-on-the-healthy-babies-healthy-children-program/">My notes</a>)
</p>

<p>
I still wanted to learn more about play. We went
to <a href="https://torontopubliclibrary.ca">libraries</a> and <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/children-parenting/children-programs-activities/child-family-programs-and-groups/child-family-programs/">EarlyON child and family centres</a>
for songs, storytime, and free play. One of our
favourites was the EarlyON centre at Indian Road
Crescent, where Ms. Lesley was basically how I
imagine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers">Mr. Rogers</a> or <a href="https://www.bluey.tv/characters/calypso/">Calypso</a>: kind, appreciative,
and wise. I reach for her voice in my head when I
want a model for how to talk to kids.
</p>

<p>
Thank goodness for <a href="https://www.bluey.tv/">Bluey</a>, too, which not only
demonstrated a whole trove of little games that we
could play, but also helped me imagine more
playful parenting with the examples of Bandit and
Chilli. Bluey's totally a parenting show disguised
as a kids' cartoon. A+ often suggests playing
games from Bluey, like:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://blueypedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowlands">Shadowlands</a>: walk only on shadows</li>
<li>Bandit's version of Follow the Leader: kids hide right behind leader, leader complains (from <a href="https://blueypedia.fandom.com/wiki/Daddy_Putdown">Daddy Putdown</a>)</li>
<li>Come Here / Go Away: played on the swing, where the humour also comes from the complaints (from <a href="https://blueypedia.fandom.com/wiki/Daddy_Putdown">Daddy Putdown</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I also borrowed all the books on play that I could
find, like <a href="https://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/29429/">Playful Parenting</a> (Lawrence J.
Cohen, 2008) and <a href="https://nifplay.org/books/play-how-it-shapes-the-brain-opens-the-imagination-and-invigorates-the-soul/">Play</a> (Stuart Brown, Christopher
Vaughan, 2009), because of course I'd try to learn
about play from books. Might be time to reread
them, come to think of it.

<h3 id="playfulness-figuring-out-our-types-of-play">Figuring out our types of play</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-playfulness-figuring-out-our-types-of-play">
<p>
Thanks to all these different resources, I found
lots of ideas to try. Experimenting helped me
gradually figure out the things that resonated
with both A+ and me. I liked the <a href="https://www.rcmusic.com/learning/oscar-peterson-school-of-music/music-classes-for-babies-toddlers-and-preschool">music classes</a>
that A+ and I went to when she was younger. We
also read and read and read. I couldn't quite do
the cheerful patter I sometimes heard from other
parents, but songs and books helped me fill in the
times when I didn't have much to say to A+. I
found another little form of play to share with
her, changing the words in a book or a song so
that she'd laughingly correct me. She started
talking at 18 months, a little on the late side of
normal, but quickly expanded her vocabulary. (Also
totally fine now.)
</p>

<p>
It wasn't all cerebral, of course. A+ liked the
vestibular stimulation of swinging, so we spent a
lot of time at the playground. She also likes
climbing and hugs, so I boost her up to monkey
bars and I snuggle her for as long as she likes.
</p>

<p>
A+ likes to dive deeply into her interests, and I
like to go along with her. Over the years, I've
learned a lot about <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2021/01/a-list-of-sharks-that-are-obligate-ram-ventilators/">sharks</a>, <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/category/cubing/">Rubik's cubes</a>, Star
Wars, and <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/category/minecraft/">Minecraft</a>. That's our kind of play, too.
We have some running jokes now. For example, on
learning that nurse sharks might possibly trick
fish into a false shelter and then ambush
them,<sup><a id="fnr.nurse-shark" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.nurse-shark" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> we had fun imagining a nurse
shark holding a "Definitely not a trap" sign. This
sketch doesn't quite have the shark pointing
upwards, but it was fun anyhow.
</p>

<p>

<p></p>

<p>
I'm learning a lot about play from life with A+.
I'm learning that it can look different from
person to person. I tend to have a quieter type of
play, and that's okay. Also, if I don't feel like
playing a particular way, it's good to say so. We
can usually figure out something else, or I can
figure out what I need and then check in again
when I'm ready.
</p>

<p>
I'm upfront about still figuring all of this out.
I think it's good for her to see that. Sure, it
would make more sense for fun to be natural and
effortless, but this is the kind of person I am,
so I've got to work with what I've got&#x2013;and that's
enjoyable too, in its own way.
</p>

<p>
One of the things that's been helping me is seeing
A+ also learn about and accept her own play
preferences. At the playground, A+ often takes a
break when her friends play a shrieky sort of game
like tag. She knows she doesn't like those kinds
of games, and she can find other things to do
until her friends move on. She usually comes and
hangs out with me instead. Sometimes we go play
one of our own games. Then she heads back to check
in with her friends, and they all go off to play
something else.
</p>

<p>
It's fun watching A+ figure things out. When she
had a hard time settling down at bedtime the other
night, she suggested taking turns reading a book.
I agreed, of course. I'll always say yes when she
offers to read out loud, and reading out loud lets
me play our old game of changing things up. "I
knew you'd say yes to that," she crowed. She's
learning to offer games we both like.
</p>

<p>
We're both learning about ourselves through play.
Reading about <a href="https://nifplay.org/what-is-play/play-personalities/">play personalities</a>, I think: ah, my
dad was a joker, even towards the end of his life;
one time he stashed an ice cube under his tongue
to prank the nurse who came in to check his
temperature. My sister's a bit of one too with her
witty rejoinders. A+ might be a storyteller
considering her fascination with story variations.
I might be a creator, considering my list of
crafty hobbies and the fun I have tweaking Emacs.
Play is fun, and fun is great for self-knowledge.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-playfulness-some-things-that-seem-to-be-working-for-us-for-now">
<p>
<b>Physical play:</b> Pretty good way to get her out of
a grump. I can challenge her to tackle-hug me:
she'll try her best to push me over and collapse
on me with a hug, then I'll try my best to wrap
her up and prevent her from escaping. I can carry
her on my back and whirl around. I can lift her up
to the chin-up bar.
</p>

<p>
<b>Clapping games:</b> We can play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RhmXOrjDDs">Double Double This
This</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXJsX7T8fYM">Slide</a> pretty much anywhere.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bubbles:</b> We like <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2018/07/bubbles/">bubbles</a>. We even make our own
giant bubble mix following the <a href="https://soapbubble.fandom.com/wiki/Recipes_Guar">guar gum recipe on
the Soap Bubble wiki</a>. We've decided not to bring
giant bubbles to the park when there are lots of
kids around, though, because then we tend to get
swarmed by other kids and it's a little stressful
for A+. It's something to enjoy at small
playdates.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wordplay:</b> It's fun to come up with puns and
variations on songs. She's getting pretty good at
it too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Drawing:</b> Silly faces are fun and easy to make.
Pictionary is also good.
</p>

<p>
<b>Singing:</b> Good way to get in sync. We like to
sing songs from Disney movies and from Wicked.
There's a fair bit of research about maternal
singing<sup><a id="fnr.maternal-singing" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.maternal-singing" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>, and
<a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/38/2/136/114278/Interpersonal-Entrainment-in-Music">entrainment</a><sup><a id="fnr.entrainment" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.entrainment" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> might have prosocial
effects even for older kids. Besides, music is fun, and we can do it pretty much anywhere.
</p>

<p>
<b>Robot:</b> Lots of chores get done by the Chore-Bot
9.0. A+ is amused whenever I'm a hug-bot. She also
likes it when I'm a scientist or engineer
investigating the functions of this mysterious
device that seems to be powered by hugs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Minecraft:</b> Inside, we play in Bedrock if I've
got the patience to reboot out of Linux and into
Windows, or Java if we want to play in the world
we share with W+. A+ likes to start up new worlds
to try out different ideas or add-ons, so I'm
slowly learning how to be less attached to any
particular world.
</p>

<p>
Our shared Minecraft experiences even help us pass
the time at the playground. We often play pretend
Minecraft. I don't mind being the odd grown-up
who's pretending to mine for iron or run away from
skeletons. I think A+ enjoys rescuing me from the
predicaments I make up for myself. ("Oh no,
there's an Enderman! Aah! Don't look at it!"
"Here's a pumpkin I carved!")
</p>

<p>
<b>Stories:</b> A+ loves making up stories related to
Disney or Star Wars characters. Sometimes we use
the fortunately/unfortunately structure to
improvise a story, and sometimes we just pile
things on. When I'm tired, it's hard for me to
imagine enough to improvise, but I'm glad that I
can explore some of her "what if" questions with
ideas translated from fanfic. She also does a bit
of LLM-prompting of story ideas, and she includes
those in some of our bedtime improvisation as
well.

<h3 id="playfulness-looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-playfulness-looking-ahead">
<p>
I've got maybe a year or two of A+ wanting to play
with us before she focuses on playing with other
people. I'll take that however it looks: screen
time when that's what she feels like, park time
whenever we can. I'm not terribly worried about
screentime. I know that it can take a while to get
her outside, but then she wants to stay at the
park for as long as possible. It's easier to get
her outside when we have playdates, which we
schedule fairly regularly. When it's just me, we
go with the flow.
</p>

<p>
Here's what I'm keeping an eye out for to help me
get better at playing with A+:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Managing my own patience: It's a lot easier to
play when I'm well-rested, I'm not fretting, and
I don't have an unfinished task hogging my
brainspace.<sup><a id="fnr.ovsiankina-play" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.ovsiankina-play" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup></li>

<li>Seeing the invitation properly: "Can we play
together?" means "I want to connect with you."
So does "I'm bored bored bored bored bored."</li>

<li>Building our play vocabulary: Bluey is totally
research, yeah, that's why I'm watching it.
There's also paying attention to the little
things that A+ and I are curious about or enjoy.
The more things we try, the more ideas we can
combine.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's child's play, and that's why it's worth it.

Results showed that 38 dyads spontaneously engaged in social game routines.

These findings suggest that rhythms, in general, may have important implications for the establishment of interpersonal synchrony in infant-caregiver dyads.
