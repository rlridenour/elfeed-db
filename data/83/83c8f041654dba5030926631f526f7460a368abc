<p>A Paris criminal court on 31 October 2025 sentenced four Bulgarian nationals to prison for stencilling red handprints on the Shoah memorial and other Paris sites, in what judges and prosecutors described as a foreign-orchestrated effort to stir division in France .

Defendants present in court acknowledged taking part but denied antisemitic motives and rejected claims they willingly acted as proxies for a foreign power .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Z8sL3MT3Ae09AQ5AbxkcpE9Y9DU9x7kc4VlLZ1dvgV2Iwn2Huh6dFkct2fd2YhsFCk_IEiqq5YfdmovxAceX_wI8kNKPPL9oQcZ0BENRv2IKrMl1ge-bYjmwWnppwCqtfAqx5_IEHDQOWwBwEe_EmFS1K-KcCP1_zCSG4NOB1x54Hot6Jl17p1POtUbMt5pgbyPP' alt='Red handprints seen on the &#x27;Wall of the Righteous&#x27; outside the Shoah memorial in Paris after the monument was vandalised in May 2024' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Pattern of stunts: Authorities say the Paris vandalism was the first of nine similar incidents under inquiry, including pig heads at mosques and coffins near the Eiffel Tower, suggesting a recurring playbook</li><li>Operational methods: French investigators cited intelligence indicating orders were conveyed via Telegram to group leaders who then recruited lower-tier proxies to carry out the actions</li><li>Scope of tagging: Prosecutors reported 35 red handprints were placed on the Shoah memorial alongside dozens of other Paris buildings on the night of the vandalism</li><li>One suspect absent: Of the four men sentenced, one remained at large after the trial, while the three others were physically present for sentencing</li></ul><blockquote>An operation coordinated from abroad with hostile intent - Presiding judge</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Paris criminal court (judge/prosecutors): The stunt was &#x27;an operation coordinated from abroad with hostile intent&#x27; meant to stir public opinion and exploit existing divisions in French society.
