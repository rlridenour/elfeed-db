<p>Chance Miller, 9to5Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/iphone/today">launched</a> a dramatic new web interface for the
App Store. You can now get the full App Store experience right in
your browser, with dedicated pages for the iPhone, iPad, Mac,
Vision, Watch, and TV app libraries.</p>

<p>Previously, Apple’s “apps.apple.com” domain simply redirected you
to a <a href="https://www.apple.com/app-store/">generic page</a> about the App Store on Apple’s website.
Now, it takes you to a full-fledged version of the App Store you
can browse on your computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This new website is nice, but it’s not the “full” App Store experience, insofar as you can’t buy or download apps from it. It’s more like a full website <em>mirror</em> of the App Store than a web version of the App Store.</p>
