<p>France held solemn ceremonies on and around 13 November 2025 to mark the tenth anniversary of coordinated Islamic State attacks in Paris that killed between 130 and 132 people in 2015, striking the Bataclan concert hall, cafés and near the Stade de France. Survivors, families and first responders returned to memorial sites and large public gatherings paid tribute amid continuing debates over how to remember and support those still struggling with the aftermath. Analysts and campaigners also used the anniversary to warn that online radicalization remains a live threat and urged stronger action from social media and internet companies.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/NP-QqPv-VawkVshOkzfxW41zJoYxcXnng95iAfWJEtqFcmfqG7tYym0NCTCh1Z6ko-3TICdaUA6PtReRdfDyDcMaubLcBoJw71I2nKeFBBk9H95CQbq4peqkmVjqfqhvREIceVbrY5jQL2BO9EJq0XHOxHeI0oJ7z8W7M93QAWuiQSDTbPxJmY2qp_bMJKplgBRn5GD-D6ttfW8Cx7_BxCMBLQc8Byqg-Ch3ne7kALmTcnrYx8oo-w' alt='A gathering around a makeshift memorial at the Place de la République in Paris on Thursday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Role of social media: Investigations and retrospectives show social platforms shaped how the night was reconstructed, with hashtags and user-posted footage helping piece together timelines and spread messages of shelter and solidarity</li><li>Policy concerns: Terrorism analyst Michael S Smith II said policymakers still lack sufficient attentiveness and that internet companies could do more to blunt the influence capacities of groups like ISIS</li><li>Security developments: Authorities arrested an ex-girlfriend of one of the attackers in connection with an alleged new plot, underlining ongoing security investigations tied to jihadist networks</li><li>Shifting hotspots: Commentators noted that while Europe tightened defences after 2015, jihadist violence has since concentrated in parts of West Africa, changing the global counterterrorism picture</li><li>Commemoration events: Ceremonies included the inauguration of the Jardin du 13-Novembre-2015 and public gatherings at Place de la République broadcast into the night</li></ul><blockquote>I don&#x27;t see the necessary level of attentiveness from policymakers - Michael S Smith II</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Terrorism analyst Michael S Smith II: Policymakers are not paying enough attention and social media companies could do more to blunt jihadist influence online.
