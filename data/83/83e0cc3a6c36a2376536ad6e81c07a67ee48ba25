There's less than a week to go until Apple's "Awe Dropping" event, and there's a good chance that Apple will introduce an updated version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> are rumored to include new health features, an updated design, and more.<br/>

<h2 id="design_changes">Design Changes</h2><br/>
Rumors suggest the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; will have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/airpods-lineup-overhaul-2024/">new design</a>, though it's unclear what exactly will change. The design could be slightly tweaked, and it's possible Apple will make the stem smaller.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="charging_case">Charging Case</h3><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> charging case was updated last year, and now it's the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;'s turn. The case could be slimmed down, making the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; even more pocketable.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also removed the pairing button on the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; case, adding an invisible capacitive button instead, and the same change is coming to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. The LED on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; case could also be hidden beneath the surface, so it only shows up when it's on.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="audio_improvements">Audio Improvements</h2><br/>
Apple is working on a new chip for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; that will result in improved sound quality.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="active_noise_cancellation">Active Noise Cancellation</h2><br/>
The updated chip is also going to bring much better Active Noise Cancellation, according to rumors.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="heart_rate_monitoring">Heart Rate Monitoring</h2><br/>
Apple recently introduced in-ear heart rate tracking for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2, and it's a feature that's also expected to come to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;. The AirPods will be able to measure heart rate during workouts.<br/>
<br/>
If the feature works like the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 heart rate tracking, users won't be able to capture heart rate data while also streaming music to gym equipment, and Apple Watch owners won't need the capability.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="temperature_monitoring">Temperature Monitoring</h2><br/>
Temperature sensing is one of the AirPods features that Apple has been working on, though it's not clear if it will come in the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;. If it does, temperature detection through the ear would be much more accurate than the skin temperature readings from the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="live_translation">Live Translation</h2><br/>
Apple is working on a Live Translation feature for the AirPods that will provide real-time translations for in-person conversations. The feature will expand the Live Translation options introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, and it could be unveiled alongside the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ios_26">iOS 26</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; will support all of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/08/ios-26-7-new-airpods-features/">features coming in iOS 26</a>, including automatic pausing when you fall asleep, camera remote functionality, studio-quality recording, charging reminders, and more.<br/>
