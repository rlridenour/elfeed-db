<p>Iran has returned to an uneasy calm after days of antigovernment protests were met by a deadly security crackdown, with residents and monitors reporting that demonstrations have largely subsided for now. Iranian authorities say thousands were detained, while a prolonged internet blackout has limited information from inside the country. In Washington, President Trump said Iran had called off or “cancelled” mass hangings of detained protesters, a step he publicly welcomed as he signaled a less confrontational tone.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/bhpD4J7iqw2tz4ZtoMBu-0Rkd3FfyUSWlDyVKbFDJWJMzLirUijbW4GecmS3XIFOUddnRTmkv3m20G4_AiexLhYXAZONt4XT2Ff6jCioIorG4Bkc9SEap3MjDs1EEUWTpTPXBQA8kKBa_EhfbTrGsoDTDP-bLpUozzrvisgX2CWIker6dd-S5ldy4yZP2DSmmS8XtBzEgQc' alt='A burned bus at Sadeghieh Square in Tehran on Thursday, after the protests were largely subdued.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Arrest figures: Iran’s government said about 3,000 people were arrested during the unrest as major cities stayed largely calm afterward.</li><li>Internet shutdown: NetBlocks reported a “total internet blackout” lasting more than 180 hours, longer than the shutdown reported during Iran’s 2019 protests.</li><li>Cleric rhetoric: Senior cleric Ahmad Khatami called for death sentences for detained demonstrators and issued direct threats toward President Trump in a Friday sermon.</li><li>US red lines: President Trump has described executions and the killing of peaceful protesters as “red lines” that could trigger US action, though recent remarks suggest he may be stepping back from a strike.</li><li>Opposition call: Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s late shah, said he expects the Islamic Republic to fall and urged a coordinated weekend demonstration while speaking in Washington.</li></ul><blockquote>Iran canceled the hanging of over 800 people, - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: He publicly thanked Iran’s leadership for not carrying out mass hangings and said Iran’s actions, not Gulf intermediaries, affected his decision-making on a potential response.
