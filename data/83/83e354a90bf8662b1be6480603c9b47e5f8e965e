<p>
Recently I found some great articles on <a href="https://www.wikihow.com">wikiHow</a>, then I want to keep notes of them in <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> files.</p>
<p>
At first, I manually copied the ToC of articles, but soon I found it&#39;s tedious and takes a lot of time.
Today I wrote a <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/">requests</a>-based Python script to help me extract the ToCs (Table of Content) into org-mode outlines. It takes two arguments, the first one is the URL, the second one is the containing heading&#39;s level for the generated ToC in org-mode.</p>
