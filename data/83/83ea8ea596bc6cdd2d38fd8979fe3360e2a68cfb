Apple launched the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> almost five years ago and with a successor now on the horizon, here are six things to expect from a second-generation model.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Smart Home Focus</h3><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/">says</a> that, just like the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, the new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; "will be built with Apple's new smart home ecosystem in mind."<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if the next &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; will have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> improvements. Unlike Apple's long-rumored smart home hub product, the new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is not expected to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New Chip</h3><br/>
The second-generation &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is highly likely to contain a more up-to-date chip for more advanced computational audio and improved responsiveness. The current &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is equipped with the Apple Watch Series 5's S5 chip from 2019. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/s9-chip-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1501" height="844" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913379" /><br/>
Apple is likely to opt for the S9 chip, which was a considerable leap forward in terms of performance, or one of its derivatives such as the S10, which is a more compact iteration of the S9. The as-yet unreleased S11 chip for the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 is also an option.<br/>
<br/>
The S5 chip in the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is derived from Apple's A12 Bionic architecture but runs at lower clock speeds and is tuned for always-on, low-power operation, making it well-suited for tasks like &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; processing and real-time audio tuning. In contrast, the S9 and S10 chips are based on the A13 chip, offering higher CPU and GPU performance, a more advanced Neural Engine, and greater efficiency per watt. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Custom Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Chip</h3><br/>
The new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; will be equipped with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a>, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Apple-Wi-Fi-Chip-Feature-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-883034" /><br/>
The chip will apparently support Wi-Fi 6E, which is much faster and has lower latency compared to the current &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;'s Wi-Fi 4 connectivity. Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible router.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Second-Generation Ultra Wideband Chip</h3><br/>
Apple could bring its second-generation Ultra Wideband chip to the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; for a more reliable and lower-latency Handoff experience. The chip debuted in 2023's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If present, the chip should allow far more precise spatial awareness than the current model, allowing it to detect the exact position and orientation of nearby devices within a few centimeters. It could also enable novel new features such as auto-adjustment of two stereo paired <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> minis when one is moved. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Improved Sound Quality</h3><br/>
The current &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; uses a single full-range driver powered by a neodymium magnet, paired with two passive radiators. The driver is positioned to fire sound downward into an acoustic waveguide that directs audio 360 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/f1602608757.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="445" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-763787" /><br/>
The waveguide and custom suspension system reduce distortion, while a three-microphone array listens for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; commands, and a fourth inward-facing mic helps cancel out sound from the speaker so voice pickup remains clear even at high volumes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could improve the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;'s audio hardware by adding a second active driver for stereo separation, upgrading the full-range driver to a higher-excursion design for better low-end and clarity, and using larger or additional passive radiators. It could also refine the waveguide to improve sound quality or incorporate higher-quality materials to enhance accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New Color Options</h3><br/>
New color options are also highly likely, but specific finishes are not yet known. The current &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; comes in Blue, Yellow, Midnight, Orange, and White. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h3>Release Date</h3><br/>
In January, Gurman reported that Apple was aiming to release a new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/">toward the end of the year</a>." If that timeframe remains accurate, the second-generation &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; could arrive anywhere from September to December 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/6-things-to-expect-from-homepod-mini-2/">6 Things to Expect From the HomePod Mini 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/6-things-to-expect-from-the-homepod-mini-2.2463251/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
