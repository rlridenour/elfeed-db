<p>Each year since 1993, the <em>Literary Review</em> has presented a Bad Sex in Fiction Award &#8220;to draw attention to the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel, and to discourage it.&#8221; Here&#8217;s 2013&#8217;s winner, Manil Suri, in his novel <em>The City of Devi</em>:</p>
