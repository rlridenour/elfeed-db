<p>News broke this week that <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity AI</a> is in talks to integrate its assistant <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-16/perplexity-in-talks-to-integrate-assistant-into-samsung-motorola-phones">directly into Samsung and Motorola phones</a>.</p>



<p>What’s especially interesting here is how this upends the usual Android assistant narrative. Google has been baking <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/">Gemini</a> into Android with increasing urgency, and now we have Android hardware makers cutting deals with a third-party assistant — one that’s not Google. That’s a big deal. It says something about how fast the AI landscape is shifting.</p>



<p>And then there’s Apple.</p>



<p>Just imagine a future where Samsung phones have Perplexity, Google phones have Gemini, and Apple…still has Siri.</p>



<p>Yikes.</p>



<p>Now, I get it. This is very on-brand for Apple. They like to own the whole stack, and they’re not the type to go shopping for outside solutions. And to be fair, there have been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-11/apple-revamps-ai-efforts-under-craig-federighi-john-giannandrea">increasing signals</a> that Apple is pouring serious resources into AI lately. Hopefully that’s not just for show.</p>



<p>Part of me can’t help but wonder if one of the smartest moves Apple could have made was to simply buy Perplexity. But that ship may have already sailed.</p>



<p>It’s not just about having an assistant; it’s about having one that <em>people want to use</em>. The AI space is sprinting, and it feels as if Apple is still stretching on the sidelines.</p>
