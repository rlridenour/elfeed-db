<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today unveiled <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-creator-studio/">Apple Creator Studio</a>, a groundbreaking
collection of powerful creative apps designed to put studio-grade
power into the hands of everyone, building on the essential role
Mac, iPad, and iPhone play in the lives of millions of creators
around the world. [...]</p>

<p>Apple Creator Studio will be available on the App Store beginning
Wednesday, January 28, for $12.99 per month or $129 per year, with
a one-month free trial, and includes access to Final Cut Pro,
Logic Pro, and Pixelmator Pro on Mac and iPad; Motion, Compressor,
and MainStage on Mac; and intelligent features and premium content
for Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and later Freeform for iPhone, iPad,
and Mac. College students and educators can subscribe for $2.99
per month or $29.99 per year. Alternatively, users can also choose
to purchase the Mac versions of Final Cut Pro, Pixelmator Pro,
Logic Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage individually as a
one-time purchase on the Mac App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One-time purchase pricing, from the footnotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One-time-purchase versions of Final Cut Pro ($299.99 U.S.), Logic
Pro ($199.99 U.S.), Pixelmator Pro ($49.99 U.S.), Motion ($49.99
U.S.), Compressor ($49.99 U.S.), and MainStage ($29.99 U.S.) are
available on the Mac App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll have more to say later today, but my first observation is that with the exception of the new version of Pixelmator, the user interfaces of these apps completely ignore Liquid Glass. That could be a statement from the design teams for these apps, or could be a factor only of version requirements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pixelmator Pro for iPad is compatible with iPad models with the
A16, A17 Pro, or M1 chip or later running iPadOS 26 or later.
The Apple Creator Studio version of Pixelmator Pro requires
macOS 26. [...]</p>

<p>The one-time-purchase versions of Final Cut Pro requires macOS
15.6 or later, Logic Pro requires macOS 15.6 or later, and
Pixelmator Pro requires macOS 12.0 or later. MainStage is
available for any Mac supported by macOS 15.6 or later. Motion
requires macOS 15.6 or later. Compressor requires macOS 15.6 or
later and some features require a Mac with Apple silicon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My hope is that the UI shown today for Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Motion, and MainStage is a flat-out rejection of Liquid Glass for “serious” apps. My fear is that it’s only a result of their continued support for MacOS 15 Sequoia. (But I think they need to continue supporting MacOS 15 Sequoia because so many pro users are rejecting MacOS 26 Tahoe.)</p>
