Apple&#8217;s latest operating systems—iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS, and watchOS—are packed with hidden gems that can enhance your user experience. In this episode of Mac Geek Gab, hosts Dave Hamilton, Adam Christianson, and Pilot Pete dive into some of these lesser-known features, offering practical tips and insights to help you make the most of your Apple devices.</p>
<h4 class="font-bold text-sm">Quick Tip: Math Calculations in Text Messages</h4>
<p class="mt-2">Listener Tim kicks off the episode with a quick tip that might just change the way you handle math on your Apple devices. With the latest OS updates, you can now perform math calculations directly within text messages. Simply type your equation, and when you hit the equal sign, you&#8217;ll have the option to either display the result or keep the equation as is. This feature is available across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, making it a handy tool for quick calculations on the go.</p>
<h4 class="font-bold text-sm">Discovering Hidden Features in iOS 18</h4>
<p class="mt-2">The hosts delve into some of the hidden features in iOS 18 that you might have missed. For instance, Martin shares a tip about a new power button in the Control Center, allowing you to turn off your iPhone without the usual button gymnastics. This software button is a welcome addition, simplifying the process of powering down your device.</p>
<p class="mt-2">Another noteworthy feature is iPhone mirroring, which Doug highlights as a game-changer for multitasking. This feature allows you to interact with your iPhone via your laptop, using your keyboard and mouse for apps that don&#8217;t have Mac or web equivalents. It&#8217;s a convenient solution for those moments when your phone is charging across the room.</p>
<h4 class="font-bold text-sm">Embracing the Future with Spatial Photos and Videos</h4>
<p class="mt-2">Taryn brings attention to the spatial or 3D camera feature in the new iPhone 16 models. This feature allows you to capture spatial videos and photos, creating immersive memories that can be experienced in 3D. While the Apple Vision Pro might not be on everyone&#8217;s immediate purchase list, the ability to capture 3D images of loved ones is a compelling reason to consider upgrading your device.</p>
<h4 class="font-bold text-sm">Fitness and Fun with Vision Pro</h4>
<p class="mt-2">Adam shares his experience with a new app for the Vision Pro called Beat, Punch, Fun and Fitness. This app combines rhythm-based boxing with fitness tracking, offering a fun and immersive way to exercise. With features like integration with your Apple Music library, it&#8217;s a versatile app that adds a new dimension to your workout routine.</p>
<h4 class="font-bold text-sm">Navigating the Challenges of Upgrading</h4>
<p class="mt-2">The episode also touches on the challenges of upgrading to new OS versions. Listener Steve shares his experience of running into storage issues while updating his iPhone SE 2 to iOS 18. His story serves as a reminder to always check your backups and ensure they are current before attempting major updates.</p>
<h4 class="font-bold text-sm">Security Tips: Don&#8217;t Get Caught</h4>
<p class="mt-2">In a new segment called &#8220;Don&#8217;t Get Caught,&#8221; the hosts discuss potential pitfalls and how to avoid them. From managing Mac addresses after OS upgrades to understanding the implications of Apple&#8217;s stolen device protection, these tips are designed to help you navigate the complexities of modern technology without getting caught off guard.</p>
<h4 class="font-bold text-sm">Setting Up a Home Automation Hub</h4>
<p class="mt-2">Listener Deke poses an interesting question about setting up a dedicated iPad for home automation. The hosts explore various solutions, including using screen time settings to restrict access to personal data while allowing control of home automation apps. This discussion highlights the flexibility of Apple&#8217;s ecosystem in creating customized solutions for smart home management.</p>
<h4 class="font-bold text-sm">The Lifespan of SSDs: What You Need to Know</h4>
<p class="mt-2">Larry&#8217;s question about the lifespan of SSDs sparks a discussion on the durability and longevity of solid-state drives. While SSDs do have a finite number of write cycles, the hosts reassure listeners that with proper backup strategies, the risk of data loss is minimal. They also touch on tools like Micromat&#8217;s Lifespan, which can help monitor the health of your SSD.</p>
<h4 class="font-bold text-sm">Conclusion</h4>
<p class="mt-2">This episode of Mac Geek Gab is a treasure trove of tips and insights for Apple enthusiasts. Whether you&#8217;re looking to unlock hidden features, enhance your fitness routine, or navigate the challenges of upgrading, the hosts provide valuable advice to help you get the most out of your Apple devices. For more tips and discussions, be sure to listen to the full episode and explore the wealth of knowledge shared by Dave Hamilton, Adam Christianson, and Pilot Pete.</p>
