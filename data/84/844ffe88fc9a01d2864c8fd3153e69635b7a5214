<p><em>This article has been edited for clarity</em></p>
<p>When the last two digits of the year change, as every 12 months they inevitably do, muscle memory tends to work against us. As Johnny Decimal says, <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/20-29-communication/22-blog/22.00.0094-dont-type-the-date-by-hand/" target="_blank">don’t type the date by hand</a>! Johnny recommends using <a href="https://www.raycast.com/" target="_blank">Raycast</a> to create a snippet that automatically creates today’s date in the correct format.</p>
<p>Yes, I said <em>correct format</em> because there’s only one right way to type the date but many wrong ways that cause the space-time continuum to shake on its timey-wimey foundations! I’m not talking about the dates you hand write in longhand at the top of a physical page; knock yourself out with those. This is about dates written entirely in numbers.</p>
<p>I’ve known for years that year-month-day is the only format that sorts chronologically in the digital world, but what I didn’t know when <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/073-obsessively-date-format-opinionated">this post</a> was published is that of the two ways to write the code that becomes year-month-day dates (<code>yyyy-mm-dd</code> and <code>YYYY-mm-dd</code>), it matters which one you choose.</p>
<p>Both <em>can</em> be correct, <em>in the right context</em>.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that I’m not a coder. I learn what I need to in order to do what I want to do, and only use the whole yyyy thing in apps like Obsidian, Keyboard Maestro, and Drafts. The information presented here relates to those apps only; not the broader coding world (not that I’d know it if they did!).</p>
<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@_Davidsmith/113663817771361843" target="_blank">This post</a> from David Smith showed me that <code>yyyy</code> is the one most people are looking for. When I was creating Obsidian templates for my <em>weekly</em> notes, however, <code>YYYY</code> was the correct choice. I finally understand why they aren’t and should not be interchangeable. <code>yyyy</code> gives you an independent 4-digit year, while <code>YYYY</code> gives the year relative to the week of the year. ^1</p>
<p>Forgive me for not explaining it better than that; I have much to learn. If you’re creating templates in Obsidian, just remember that you need to use <code>yyyy</code> if you don’t want the last few days of the year to show the incorrect year.</p>
<p>Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to set yourself up with a keyboard shortcut to insert the correctly formatted current date wherever it’s needed. Text Expander and Keyboard Maestro are two capable paid options, or you can follow <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/20-29-communication/22-blog/22.00.0094-dont-type-the-date-by-hand/" target="_blank">Johnny’s instructions</a> to use the free utility, <a href="https://www.raycast.com/" target="_blank">Raycast</a>. There are others. ^2</p>
<p>Obsidian has the Natural Language Dates plugin that does the job nicely, but I recommend a system-wide solution that doesn’t just work in one app alone.</p>

<p>[^1] There’s also <code>gggg</code> and <code>GGGG</code> for week years. I have yet to learn the difference between the Gs and the Ys. See <a href="https://momentjscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moment/04-displaying/01-format/" class="uri" target="_blank">https://momentjscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moment/04-displaying/01-format/</a></p>
<p>[²] I don’t know all the ways to automatically add the date when typing, but there are a lot of them. Text Expander, for example. In Keyboard Maestro I use <code>(%ICUDateTime%yyyy-MM-dd%)</code>, in Drafts <code>[[date|%Y-%m-%d]].</code>Note that the code Drafts uses for dates is a little different.
