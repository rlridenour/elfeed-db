<p>In 1888, on reading that the villanelle requires &#8220;an elaborate amount of care in production, which those who read only would hardly suspect existed,&#8221; British philologist W.W. Skeat <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xoP3HGYZBUAC&#038;pg=PA343">tossed off this one</a>:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all a trick, quite easy when you know it,<br />
As easy as reciting A B C,<br />
You need not be an atom of a poet.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve a grain of wit, and want to show it,<br />
Writing a <em>villanelle</em> &#8212; take this from me &#8212;<br />
It&#8217;s all a trick, quite easy when you know it.</p>
<p>You start a pair of rimes, and then you &#8220;go it”<br />
With rapid-running pen and fancy free;<br />
You need not be an atom of a poet.</p>
<p>Take any thought, write round it and below it,<br />
Above or near it, as it liketh thee;<br />
It&#8217;s all a trick, quite easy when you know it.</p>
<p>Pursue your task, till, like a shrub, you grow it,<br />
Up to the standard size it ought to be;<br />
You need not be an atom of a poet.</p>
<p>Clear it of weeds, and water it, and hoe it,<br />
Then watch it blossom with triumphant glee.<br />
It&#8217;s all a trick, quite easy when you know it;<br />
You need not be an atom of a poet.</p>
