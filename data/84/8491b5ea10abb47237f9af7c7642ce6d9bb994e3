<p id="p5"><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/04/get-active-with-apple-watch/" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a press release</a>, Apple&rsquo;s chief operating officer, Jeff Williams said:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote6"><p>
  Apple Watch has changed the way people think about, monitor, and engage with their fitness and health. A decade ago, we introduced Activity rings &mdash; and since then, Apple Watch has grown to offer an extensive set of features designed to empower every user. People write to us almost every day sharing how Apple Watch has made a difference in their life, from motivating them to move more throughout the day, to changing the trajectory of their health.
