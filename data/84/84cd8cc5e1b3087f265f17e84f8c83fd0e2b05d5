<p>While I was putting together my recent post on Maya calendar calculations, I tried to get some information on the Moon from a NASA website. Specifically, a page with the prosaic name <em>Moon Fact Sheet</em> at the URL</p>
<pre><code>https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/moonfact.html
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>gsfc</code> part of the domain refers to the Goddard Space Flight Center, and the <code>nssdc</code> part refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Space_Science_Data_Coordinated_Archive">NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive</a> (formerly the National Space Science Data Center, which explains the missing <code>a</code>). It’s one of several similar pages with nicely summarized information on planets and other bodies in the solar system.</p>
<p>Did I say it <em>is</em> one of several such pages? I meant it <em>was</em> one of several such pages. They’re all gone and apparently have been for a few months now. Why? Well, my first thought was some sort of DOGE-inspired budget cut that saved the US taxpayer the untold billions of dollars necessary to host maybe as much as a half-megabyte of static HTML.</p>
<p>Or maybe NASA itself was to blame. Maybe it decided to replace the dry but wonderfully useful tables of numbers with <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/">this page</a> and similar, which have lots of nice images but very few numbers. Or maybe the various Fact Sheets have been moved where neither Google nor Kagi can find them.</p>
<p>Whatever the answer, I was sad for the loss. But only momentarily. Because the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> still had the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250818154127/https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/moonfact.html">Moon Fact Sheet</a> and all the other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250818154100/https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planetfact.html">Planetary Fact Sheets</a>. Hooray!</p>

<p>I’ve bookmarked the planetary sheet, as it has links to all the others. For what it’s worth, the last archived versions seem to date from August of this year.</p>
<p>As an early Christmas present to myself, and to the rest of the internet, I <a href="https://archive.org/donate?origin=iawww-TopNavDonateButton">made a donation</a>.</p>
