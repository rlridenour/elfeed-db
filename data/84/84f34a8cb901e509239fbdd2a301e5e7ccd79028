<p>The planned Rohan City will have at its center a square named for Simone Weil, and it will also have two other parks: one named for John Locke and the other for Derek Parfit.</p>
<p>Each of the following philosophers will have a street named after them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Rudolf Carnap<br />
Jacques Derrida<br />
Josef Ludvik Fischer<br />
G.W.F. Hegel<br />
Ladislav Hejdánek<br />
Thomas Hobbes<br />
Edmund Husserl<br />
Immanuel Kant<br />
Erazim Kohák<br />
Emmanuel Levinas<br />
John Stuart Mill<br />
Radim Palouš<br />
Roger Scruton<br />
Jan Sokol<br />
Ludwig Wittgenstein</p>
<p>The main investor in the new development is the <a href="https://www.sekyragroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sekyra Group</a>, a name that may be familiar to readers owing to the <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/10/25/oldest-professorship-in-philosophy-gets-new-name/">renaming of Oxford University&#8217;s White&#8217;s Chair of Moral Philosophy</a> in 2021. According to <a href="https://praguemorning.cz/new-prague-district-pays-tribute-to-famous-philosophers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Prague Morning</em></a>, the company&#8217;s founder, Luděk Sekyra, said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I am pleased that our proposal to commemorate key Czech and Western philosophers has been accepted. These individuals have played a crucial role in shaping our civilization, influencing discussions on values, freedom, morality, and justice, both through their work and personal convictions.</em></p>
<p>Of course, the plans for the new neighborhood raise several questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it true that the crime rates will be very low on Hobbes Street and on Mill Street, but for very different reasons?</li>
<li>Will mixing one&#8217;s labor with the land in Locke Park be prohibited?</li>
<li>Shouldn&#8217;t Kant Street be <em>a lot</em> wider?</li>
<li>What could possibly be at the intersection of Carnap and Derrida?</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;among others. For answers, we will have to wait another five to ten years, when, according to the developers, the construction of the new neighborhood and its buildings (including a new school) will be complete.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/07/where-the-streets-are-named-for-philosophers/">Where the Streets are Named for Philosophers</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
