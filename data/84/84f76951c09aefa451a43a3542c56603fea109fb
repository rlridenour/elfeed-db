One of the problems with the ELPA package manager is that you never know what you&rsquo;re getting when you upgrade. The package manager tells you what packages can be upgraded and you can choose to upgrade or not but you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s changed.

Happily, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1q978w9/packageel_package_diffreview_feature_has_landed/">a new feature has just been committed</a>. Now you can examine a diff between the old and new versions to get an idea of what has changed. It&rsquo;s not ideal if you can&rsquo;t read Elisp but at least those who do read it can get an idea of how the new version differs from the previous.

It&rsquo;s not a big thing, I suppose, but it <i>does</i> show how Emacs is continuing to improve and make its users&rsquo; lives better. This new capability probably won&rsquo;t be available until the next release but it&rsquo;s something to look forward to.</p>
