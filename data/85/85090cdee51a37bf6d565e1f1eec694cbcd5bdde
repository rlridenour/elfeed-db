<p>Turkish prosecutors filed a lengthy indictment on November 11 alleging that Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu led a criminal organisation and seeking a prison term of more than 2,000 years, an action his supporters call politically motivated. The charges listed include bribery, embezzlement, money laundering, extortion and tender rigging, and the opposition says the case could be used to bar him from running in the 2028 presidential race. Imamoglu, a high-profile rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who was detained in March, has denied the allegations and his party called the indictment &quot;nonsense&quot;.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/rybvRtI7EUhC1KLbkVOUPad6r8CqjLLFj1hwPXBfxUHu1VvV-sNGcT21ZuFkojx0VR9PsbTsxtd3TAZI8Y_RiSaGFUSJO5Mc0dqp8QsvkooJ' alt='A protester holds a sign featuring an image of Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu during a rally in Istanbul opposing the court actions, September file photo.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Size of indictment: The indictment submitted by prosecutors runs to nearly 4,000 pages, according to reporting that described its scope and documentation.</li><li>Number of charges: Prosecutors listed 142 separate offences against Imamoglu within the indictment, a count reported by local and international outlets.</li><li>Co-defendant scope: The prosecution&#x27;s filing names 402 suspects in total, indicating a broad case that reaches beyond the mayor himself.</li><li>Maximum sentence cited: State-linked Anadolu news agency reported the indictment could translate into a theoretical sentence of up to 2,430 years, a higher figure than some international summaries.</li></ul><blockquote>This case is not legal; it is entirely political.
