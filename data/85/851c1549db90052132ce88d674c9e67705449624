<p>The United States and Kenya have signed a new five‑year Health Cooperation Framework in Washington that will channel $2.5 billion into Kenya’s health sector under President Trump’s revamped “America First” global health strategy. The agreement, signed on December 4 by Kenyan President William Ruto and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, replaces multiple earlier health deals with a single, broader framework focused on saving lives, strengthening Kenya’s health system and aligning with wider US foreign policy goals. Under the deal, the US plans to provide more than $1.6 billion in health funding, while Kenya commits to boost its own domestic health spending by $850 million over the same period, signalling a shared investment rather than purely one‑sided aid. Kenya becomes the first African country to conclude such a partnership, which Washington expects to replicate with other governments as it reorients global health funding toward infectious‑disease threats in partner nations.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/pas-nEKQUgJVWbmIGQj2ULMma_TdsNMgldI1DeTXHisCSCTiv4NMt4yT_PZLwyzoSmvqK__yGgvYUu3OWTtsXZkDHVLd1YzOIE0mbxz7DLrJGnZMUwa0mzjlmEnBMHhMKpahojUzRnvGCdiwZUXFDusaYyAYuvydaCvytScrBC5moT7jGmEXgtQct5cnk47TwwNjdrCd9VdxK7eHDiOL7py9tR0QFZVDTZUSEkLYR-pmYrqZscuubXMiEFpJlAxkQNSvyodz' alt='Kenyan President William Ruto and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio attend events in Washington linked to the signing of the new US–Kenya health cooperation framework.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scope of support: The new framework covers a wide range of health areas, including infectious disease control, health‑system strengthening and emergency preparedness, consolidating what had previously been a patchwork of separate US‑funded programs in Kenya.</li><li>Mutual benefits: US officials say the cooperation is designed not only to improve Kenyan health outcomes but also to help protect Americans from cross‑border disease threats by bolstering surveillance and response capacity in East Africa.</li><li>Domestic financing: Kenya’s pledge to raise its own health expenditure by $850 million over five years is framed as a step toward greater self‑reliance and sustainability in funding clinics, staff and essential medical supplies.</li><li>Model for others: US officials expect the Kenya pact to serve as a template for dozens of similar “America First” health agreements with other countries that meet Washington’s broader diplomatic and security criteria.</li><li>Kenya’s first‑mover role: By successfully negotiating this framework ahead of other African nations, Kenya positions itself as an early partner in the reshaped US global health architecture and a potential regional hub for future initiatives.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Department of State: The US government frames the Health Cooperation Framework as a comprehensive vision to save lives, strengthen Kenya’s health system and, in doing so, make America safer, stronger and more prosperous by tackling health threats before they spread.
