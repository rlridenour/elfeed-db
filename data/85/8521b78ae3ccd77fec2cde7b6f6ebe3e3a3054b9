<blockquote>
  <p>This would not only be the first time Apple has created a
non-watch heart rate sensor, but even more notably, the first time
the company has enabled heart rate broadcasting over existing
Bluetooth heart rate standards.</p>

<p>The question then becomes: Is it accurate?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it turns out, that was not the question I should
have started with. The real question to start with is: Is the
heart rate function (accuracy aside), even usable? A lot of hours
later, I have answers to both of those questions. And trust me,
it’s a very mixed bag.</p>

<p>The answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s clear that any movement (even on a stationary bike) quickly
leads to either dropouts or inaccurate heart rate. And outdoors
running, it’s even worse. Ultimately, I don’t see any value in the
heart rate sensor in this product, because it’s simply not good
enough to be useful, even for casual use.</p>

<p>So maybe this feature is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/chance-miller-reviews-the-beats-powerbeats-pro-2"><em>not</em> soon coming</a> to AirPods? I think there’s <a href="https://mastodon.social/@_Davidsmith/114105204080909252">a good argument to be made</a> that these are better than no heart rate monitor at all but also not nearly as good as an Apple Watch or dedicated device.</p>
