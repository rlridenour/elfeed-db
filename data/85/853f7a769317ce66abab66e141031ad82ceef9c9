I could have written these words:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you are anything like me, you probably feel something is wrong whenever you have to input text outside of Emacs.
</p>

but I didn&rsquo;t. They were actually written by Thanos Apollo. Like me, he loves the idea of Emacs Everywhere so that he seldom, if ever, has to input text outside of Emacs. The problem is, he&rsquo;s a Wayland user and the <a href="https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-everywhere">Emacs Everywhere</a> package doesn&rsquo;t (yet?) work there. Happily, for those of you running Emacs on Wayland, he <a href="https://thanosapollo.org/posts/use-emacs-everywhere/">has a fix for you</a>.
</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s a bit of Elisp to add to your <code>init.el</code> and a package, <a href="https://github.com/atx/wtype">wtype</a>, to install if it isn&rsquo;t already on your system. His post shows you how to set things up step by step so take a look if you&rsquo;re interested.

<p>
If you&rsquo;re not using Wayland—in particular if you&rsquo;re on macOS—this doesn&rsquo;t apply to you and you should just install the Emacs Everywhere package. But if you <i>are</i> using Wayland, welcome to the club. I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;ll find, like Apollo and I, that being able to input text with Emacs no matter what app you&rsquo;re in is a game changer and stress reducer.
