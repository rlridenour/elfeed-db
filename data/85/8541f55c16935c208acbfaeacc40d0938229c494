Apple appears to have joined Meta-owned <a href="https://www.threads.com/@apple">social media site Threads</a>, two years after Threads first launched. Apple has a verified Threads profile and the @apple handle, but has yet to make any posts. Apple's account has 4.8 million followers, because of its existing followers on Instagram. <br/>

It's not clear why Apple has opted to make a Threads account, and there's no word on whether it will actually see use. Apple also has the @apple handle on X, but it uses the account for advertising and does not share content there (though it does on other specific feature accounts). Apple has a similar unused Facebook account.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does have an active @apple Instagram account where it regularly posts Shot on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> videos, and an @apple TikTok account for sharing Apple product tips.<br/>
