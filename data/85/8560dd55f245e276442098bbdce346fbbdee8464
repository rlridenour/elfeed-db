<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 5 iOS licenses ($29.99 value each) for <a href="https://amadine.com/">Amadine</a>. Whether you&rsquo;re a creative professional or an amateur with big ideas, Amadine is a vector design tool that can help you get there, no matter how big the goal. This is a really powerful design app that I surprisingly hadn&rsquo;t heard of until it was requested on the forum. The developer was gracious enough to provide licenses for a few lucky readers 🥳.</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developed with precision and attention to what users need, this graphic design app offers every tool and feature to bring the craziest ideas to life.</p>
