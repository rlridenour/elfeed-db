The store has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/apple-regent-street-store-closed/">temporarily closed for "refurbishment"</a> since Monday, January 12. The extent of the changes remains to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
It is not yet clear if Apple made any changes that will be visible to customers. In some cases, Apple only updates a store's fixtures or back-of-house area, resulting in no visible differences to customers when business resumes.<br/>

Apple first opened up shop on London's world-famous Regent Street in 2004.
