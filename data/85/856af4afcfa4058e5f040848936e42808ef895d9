<p>In symmetry with my post, <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/import-markdown-to-org-with-the-clipboard-in-emacs.html">Import Markdown to Org with the Clipboard in Emacs</a>, exporting Org to Markdown via the system clipboard might be desired instead. Turns out, Marcin Borkowski has already done this as detailed in his post <a href="https://mbork.pl/2021-05-02_Org-mode_to_Markdown_via_the_clipboard">Org-mode to Markdown via the clipboard</a> with the function <code>org-copy-region-as-markdown</code>. In my Emacs initialization, I’ve taken the liberty of prefixing that function name with <code>mb/</code> to disambiguate it with actual functions from Org.</p>
<p>If you prefer to write in Org but need to post in Markdown, definitely give Borkowski’s post a look.</p>
