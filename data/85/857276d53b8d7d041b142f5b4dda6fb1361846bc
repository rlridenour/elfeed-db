<p>In the latest development, Hamas handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross the remains of an Israeli hostage inside Gaza on Friday, which Israel has identified as 75-year-old Eliyahu “Churchill” Margalit from Kibbutz Nir Oz [theglobeandmail.com#1][theguardian.com#1][bbc.com#1][euronews.com#1]. It is the 10th set of remains returned under the current ceasefire framework, out of 28 bodies Israel says are still in Gaza; Israel has accused Hamas of moving too slowly even as a fragile truce largely holds [bbc.com#1][straitstimes.com#2][ft.com#1]. Hamas says searches are painstaking because many bodies are under rubble or in destroyed tunnels and that heavy machinery and outside help are needed, pledging to continue returns as remains are found [aljazeera.com#1][cbsnews.com#1]. Mediators including Egypt, Qatar and Turkey remain involved, and President Trump has urged patience while recovery efforts continue [dawn.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uMJR6IoLxGVr7-cLwvK0mK4G2qZDHV_DfqTag-NVLtkPd-d27e9AXGRURPA9QIlKI0BEo2wR432lpDhLcb-DtxT0G2gIH5Pyx59Xu6HG3caOzDK9juFDeTIxxWoYiqASdzLjKuy76B47O8mm-2hmkTZY2BlQSP2f4vlbuFCxZ7jPn_pQOILMpGa4etTHZKE_1EXd_uRpC7F-ntVy6hhlHXdbZYltqokpOWaBs--l42eQpeCFglnhTRKzd4WhmnFTQrNu4f1-kufXdlH5TA' alt='A Red Cross vehicle arrives as teams search for hostages’ remains in Khan Younis, Gaza.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Khan Younis recovery: The body was located in Khan Younis, where two bulldozers dug pits during the search operation [abc.net.au#1][euronews.com#1].</li><li>Family connection: Margalit’s daughter, Nili, was also abducted on 7 October 2023 but was released in a November 2023 exchange [theguardian.com#1][straitstimes.com#1].</li><li>Forensic procedure: The Red Cross transferred the coffin to Israeli forces inside Gaza, with onward transfer to Israel’s National Center for Forensic Medicine for formal identification before next-of-kin notification [theglobeandmail.com#1][lemonde.fr#1].</li><li>Remaining bodies: Israel says 18 slain hostages’ remains are still being held in Gaza and expects them returned under the deal [timesofisrael.com#1][straitstimes.com#2].</li><li>Turkish specialists: Turkey says specialist teams dispatched to help find remains are awaiting Israeli authorization to enter Gaza [dawn.com#1][france24.com#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prime Minister’s Office (Israel): The government urged Hamas to abide by the deal and return all remaining bodies promptly.
