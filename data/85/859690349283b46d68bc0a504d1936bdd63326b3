<p>When the history books are written, we’ll remember the politicians, law firms, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-inauguration-tech-billionaires-zuckerberg-musk-wealth-0896bfc3f50d941d62cebc3074267ecd">CEOs who quickly bent the knee to Donald Trump. </a>We’ll also remember the scant few American figures who refused to back down. Bruce Springsteen will be high on that short list.</p>
<p>Touring in Europe last summer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Tzap8lkdPXk">Springsteen warned</a> his audience: “The America that I love, the America I have written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.” Those words seem particularly prescient given the chaos and violence now unfolding in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Following the shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, Springsteen made his voice heard again—this time through music. Last week, he released the protest song <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2026/01/bruce-springsteen-condemns-ice-violence-in-streets-of-minneapolis.html">“Streets of Minneapolis”</a> and soon afterward traveled to Minnesota to perform the song live at a benefit concert arranged by Tom Morello. Speaking to the crowd, Springsteen said, “I wrote Streets of Minneapolis and recorded it the next day.” When he wondered if the song sounded too ‘soapboxy,’ he turned to Morello, and the Rage Against the Machine guitarist replied, “Bruce, nuance is wonderful, but sometimes you need to kick them in the teeth.” We’ll say amen to that.</p>
<p>After “Streets of Minneapolis,” Springsteen and Morello performed “The Ghost of Tom Joad.” Watch it above. The start of the show began with “Killing In The Name Of.” Catch it below.</p>
