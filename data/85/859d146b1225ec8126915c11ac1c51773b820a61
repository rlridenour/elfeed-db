It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve written about my Mu4e configuration. Back in 2015, I read Ben Maughan&rsquo;s post on his system for achieving Inbox Zero with Mu4e. I was immediately taken with the idea and although it took me some time, I eventually <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=6115">implemented his ideas at Irreal</a>. For the last ten years I&rsquo;ve been using Maughan&rsquo;s system which requires that every email be dealt with immediately by either acting on/answering it, deleting it, or generating a TODO to deal with it later. In any event if the email isn&rsquo;t deleted, it&rsquo;s saved in a single directory relying on Mu4e&rsquo;s excellent search ability to retrieve it if necessary
</p>
<p>
My system differs slightly from Maughan&rsquo;s in that I have a temporary directory to save emails that I want to save for a short while but then delete. The main example is notices from Amazon that they&rsquo;ve shipped some order. When it arrives, I delete the entry but in the meantime I have the details saved if I need them.

James Endres Howell has a <a href="https://jamesendreshowell.com/2026-01-08-custom-sorting-of-mu4e-headers.html">very nice post that describes his Mu4e workflow</a>. He uses his email provider to sort incoming email into work, personal, and a few other low priority mailboxes. His system views emails in two states: waiting to be acted on or irrevocably consigned to a permanent resting place that he dubs &ldquo;the archive&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
He has Mu4e set up so that messages that he&rsquo;s sent or that are in the archive are shown  newest first because they are the most recent and apt to be what he&rsquo;s looking for and those in the other mailboxes oldest first on the grounds that have been hanging around the longest and need to be dealt with before the more recent ones.

Howell has code implementing all this that you can examine if your interested. Although I like his post and code, the minions have been tugging on my sleeve insisting that I mention that his horrible Emacs theme makes the code virtually unreadable. Protip: Don&rsquo;t put darkblue text on a black background. Your over forty self will thank you.</p>
