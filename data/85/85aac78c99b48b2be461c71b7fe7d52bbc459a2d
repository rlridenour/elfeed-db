<p>In a 1977 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/268100a0.pdf">letter to <em>Nature</em></a>, University of Malaya geologist N.S. Haile observed the poor quality of an 1818 paper by one P.B. Shelley and presented this improvement:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Twin limb-like basalt columns (&#8216;trunkless legs&#8217;) near Wadi Al-Fazar, and their relationship to plate tectonics</p>
<p>Ibn Batuta and P.B. Shelley</p>
<p>In a recent field trip to north Hadhramaut, the first author observed two stone leg-like columns 14.7 m high by 1.8 m in diameter (medium vast, ASTM grade scale for trunkless legs) rising from sandy desert 12.5 km southwest of Wadi Al-Fazar (Grid 474 753). The rock is a tholeiitic basalt (table 1); 45 analyses by neutron activation technique show that it is much the same as any other tholeiitic basalt (table 2). A large boulder 6 m southeast of the columns has been identified as of the &#8216;shattered visage&#8217; type according to the classification of Pettijohn (1948, page 72). Granulometric analysis of the surrounding sand shows it to be a multimodal leptokurtic slightly positively skewed fine sand with a slight but persistent smell of camel dung. Four hundred and seventy two scanning electron photomicrographs were taken of sand grains and 40 are reproduced here; it is obvious from a glance that the grains have been derived from pre-cambrian anorthosite and have undergone four major glaciations, two subductions, and a prolonged dry spell. One grain shows unique lozenge-shaped impact pits and heart-like etching patterns which prove that it spent some time in upstate New York.</p>
<p>There is no particular reason to suppose that the columns do not mark the site of a former hotspot, mantle plume, triple junction, transform fault, or abduction zone (or perhaps all of these).

<p>Haile added, &#8220;I pass this on in the hope that it will be of value to authors in preparing papers for publication.&#8221;</p>
