<p>Too often, we treat speed as the primary goal in optimization.&nbsp;<strong>Faster is better!</strong></p>



<p>While modern technology and automation offer countless ways to accelerate our lives, the question we need to ask is:&nbsp;<em>should we?</em></p>



<p>There are times when delay is a feature, not a bug. Going slower has its own benefits, giving you more time for consideration and intentionality. It’s also a satisfying way to occasionally give the finger to the modern world and its relentless demands.</p>



<p>I’ve recently begun writing down things I want to learn to do slower. Although it’s a new practice for me, here’s a partial list:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reading thought-provoking books</li>



<li>Journaling</li>



<li>Talking with family and friends</li>



<li>Walking</li>



<li>Decision Making</li>



<li>Gardening</li>



<li>Enjoying media (movies, music, books)</li>



<li>Craftwork</li>
</ul>



<p>My question to you:&nbsp;<em>What should you slow down?</em>&nbsp;In your life, what might benefit from taking your foot off the gas?</p>
