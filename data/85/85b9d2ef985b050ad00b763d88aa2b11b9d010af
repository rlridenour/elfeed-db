</ul><h1>No Mo Squitoes</h1><p>Here’s a hot take: the worst days are not the days with bad weather.</p>
<p>Don’t get us wrong. Bad weather is bad. We can agree on that. Having your picnic plans ruined because of a nasty thunderstorm rolling through? It sucks. A blizzard screwing with your travel plans? Terrible. The blistering cold. The damp. The intense wind. All of it is unpleasant.</p>
<p>But at least you <em>know</em> what’s going on as soon as you look out the window. You see the rain, or the snow, or the wind blowing the trees, or the puddles, or you feel the intense cold  from beyond the glass panes. You realize immediately, in other words, that your plans are changing and can thus start to mentally reroute your day before it begins.</p>
<p>Basically, what we’re saying is that crummy weather is annoying but manageable.</p>
<p>What’s harder to wrap your mind around is something invisible.</p>
<p>It’s 75 degrees and partly sunny!</p>
<p>And also, 85% humidity.</p>
<p>Or else, the air quality is bad.</p>
<p>Or else, the mosquitoes are particularly aggressive this season.</p>
<p>These are the worst days: the days when you look out the window and see what <em>should</em> be a perfect day, only it’s not, and you’re going to be stuck inside as the birds chirp and the warm breeze blows.</p>
<p>Now, we can’t help you with the first two. But we can offer something for those pesky mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Namely, this thing.</p>
<p>What we have here is a big honkin’ lantern-looking thing that you can hang outside to rid the surrounding HALF ACRE of nasty bugs. Or, you know, not all of them. But, a lot of them. Point is, you don’t need to sit right under this thing for it to work.</p>
<p>Also, you don’t need to worry about hearing the nasty zap-crackle-pop of bug murder every few seconds. Because the way this works is as follows: it lures the bugs in with its warmth and its light; they get stuck in the trap; they die quietly; you empty the trap; and repeat.</p>
<p>That means you can enjoy a drink at dusk without someone trying to drink your blood! Unless you live next to vampires. Like the humidity and the air quality, we can’t help you with that.</p>
<p>Anyway, buy a bug trap.</p>
