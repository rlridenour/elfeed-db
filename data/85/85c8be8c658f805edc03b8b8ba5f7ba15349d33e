Donald Hunter over at <a href="https://donaldh.wtf">donaldh.wtf</a> has an interesting post about <a href="https://donaldh.wtf/2025/11/an-ode-to-org-babel/">Org Babel&rsquo;s many powers and uses</a>. Hunter thinks of it as a &ldquo;polyglot Jupyter Notebook &rdquo; and uses it extensively for both professional and personal projects. His post consists of several examples of how he uses it.
</p>
<p>
One trick he shows is using the <code>dir</code> command to specify a remote machine. That allows him to capture output from the remote host.
</p>
<p>
Another trick he uses is isolating the boilerplate for several similar source blocks into a separate block and including it in the blocks that need it with the noweb syntax. See his post for a fully worked example.
</p>
<p>
Finally he demonstrates the real power of Babel by using two different languages. The way that works is that you use a convenient language in one block to produce an intermediate result and finish the computation in a second block with another language that calls the first block to get the intermediate result.
</p>
<p>
In his example, he uses an SQL block to read data from an SQL database and processes that data in the second block using <a href="https://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/">Gnuplot</a>. Of course, you can chain more than two blocks together or have more than one block feeding the final block.

Org Babel really is a powerful system and is part of what sets Org apart from Markdown and other markup languages. You might also want to take a look at <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8452">Mike Hamrick&rsquo;s video on using Org and Babel for writing</a>.</p>
