<p>In 1937 a Sabena Junkers Ju 52 crashed in Ostend &#8212; the plane struck a factory chimney while attempting to land in thick fog. Everyone aboard was killed, including Princess Cecilie, the older sister of Prince Philip, later Duke of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>She had been eight months pregnant, and a newborn infant was discovered in the wreckage. It&#8217;s speculated that she had given birth during the flight, and that this had led the pilot to try to land in hazardous conditions.</p>
