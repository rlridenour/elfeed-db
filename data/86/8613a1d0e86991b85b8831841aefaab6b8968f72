<p>Germany announced it will lift the partial suspension on military equipment exports to Israel, returning to case-by-case licensing and making the move effective on Nov. 24, 2025. Officials said the decision was driven by a recently stabilised ceasefire in Gaza and will remain conditional on continued observance of that ceasefire and the large-scale delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The policy change reverses a suspension imposed in August amid public pressure and parliamentary debate, and German spokespeople framed the step as contingent and reversible if conditions worsen.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/YR-LA37hMmqD06tAHQf1m1KaJnkdEEVZPOX0-gzZKUBzr2tYTvxGtSg_hYM4BaqHtmXhrms0Y65H6zKQsM7HVduC2MYPOvw8FpXJcrcfWPPsAqMg1hbSGt9tp-gocL30Fl-Uo-muaqWDBgKTra_0QXw3mAnpaf4TImuTw83PWA' alt='German government announces lifting of military export restrictions in a policy update (file image).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Export ranking: Germany is the second-largest arms supplier to Israel after the United States, giving Berlin outsized influence over Israeli procurement decisions</li><li>August pause: Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced a halt to authorisations in August, saying Berlin would not approve exports that could be used in Gaza &quot;until further notice&quot;</li><li>Domestic pressure: The August restriction followed strong public opposition and parliamentary scrutiny, and the partial embargo had prompted sharp criticism from Israeli leaders earlier this year</li><li>Israeli response: Israeli ministers welcomed the move and at least one senior official urged other governments to follow Germany&#x27;s lead, framing the decision as an example for allies</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>German government: The resumption of exports will be conditional on the observance of the ceasefire and the large-scale provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza, with decisions taken case by case.
