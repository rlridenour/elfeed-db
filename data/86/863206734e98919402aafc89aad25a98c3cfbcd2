<p>I wanted to try the fake eggs (Just Eggs), so I did, and well&hellip; They taste like putty. Don&rsquo;t ask me how I know, I just do.  There are so many ingredients with weird chemicals in them! What the hell am I eating anyway? I started to freak out; I mean, I can&rsquo;t even have scrambled eggs anymore!</p>
<p>Of course this is nonsense. Egg whites are a thing, and one egg here and there won&rsquo;t kill me, and there are also so many other things I can make for breakfast. But tell it to my overwhelmed head that watched an hour worth of vegan YouTube videos yesterday. They all look so quick and easy if you know what to buy, where to buy, and have a blender, and have a big kitchen with all the equipment you know you need and know how to operate. Yes yes, as I told myself just yesterday, Rome was not built in one day. I know, I <em>know</em>! And everyone has advice, because everyone wants to help (at least I&rsquo;m surrounded by caring people, that&rsquo;s a plus, I know for many vegans the start is a big &ldquo;wtf is wrong with you&rdquo; from family and friends), and it&rsquo;s just so much.</p>
<p>I know this is how I roll. I always get <em>everything</em> into my head, it just loves sponging all the information. So now I&rsquo;m like a kid with a big Lego set spilled on the carpet in front of him, trying to build a spaceship, ya know? It&rsquo;s just a lot.</p>
<p>Today there&rsquo;s a farmer&rsquo;s market. I&rsquo;m going to get myself veggies which I&rsquo;m familiar with and focus on a salad (which I&rsquo;m familiar with), and all I&rsquo;m going to do is to spill beans into it. See how this works out. Then, since I have that soft tofu, I will substitute the Just Eggs (more like, just plastic) for tofu scrambles with some more veggies (tomatos should be good enough) and spices. Start with stuff I know. Another protein shake here, another hummus snack there, breath&hellip; breath&hellip; you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
