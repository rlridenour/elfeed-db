A rare, operational Apple-1 Computer was recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/apple-1-apple-prototypes-auction/">put up for auction</a>, and it ended up selling for &#36;375,000. The Apple-1 was the first computer sold by Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, and so few remain that they fetch high prices at auction.<br/>

The Apple-1 that sold is known as the "Bayville" Apple-1, and it is number 91 on <a href="https://www.apple1registry.com">the Apple-1 Registry</a>. The Apple-1 Registry aggregates all known remaining Apple-1 computers, and it includes details and a history for each one. The registry has 104 Apple-1 machines listed.<br/>
<br/>
The Bayville Apple-1 was part of the first batch of Apple-1 machines sold in 1976, and it has a handwritten serial number that was likely penned by Steve Jobs. It was sold with an original manual with a handwritten note by Daniel Kottke, who was Apple employee number 12.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple-1 was sold alongside many other Apple-related items as part of a "Steve Jobs and the Apple Revolution" auction event. A 1976 Apple Computer check signed by Steve Jobs sold for &#36;112,054, and a sealed, first-generation 4GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sold for &#36;87,514.<br/>

Another check signed by Steve Jobs sold for &#36;62,500, and an Apple Lisa Computer sold for &#36;56,818.
