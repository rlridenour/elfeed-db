<p>On Friday, Oct. 24, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions targeting Colombian President Gustavo Petro, members of his family and a senior aide, accusing him of allowing illegal drug trafficking to flourish and increasing flows of cocaine toward the United States . The move marks a sharp escalation in a weeks‑long diplomatic dispute between Washington and Bogotá that has included U.S. strikes on suspected drug-smuggling vessels, a cut in U.S. aid and a prior visa revocation for Petro . The administration framed the measures as protection for U.S. public health and border security, while Petro has rejected the allegations and vowed to resist what he called arbitrary measures .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fc-I3491XQnn_TPQ6El60tW8nH2aTwmehHzKE1cxtfYWfUKOgaY6UaoK8AChBqNjwkr_-zvGI2mpMovtE99z19R7kgo1_Hls57aVHq4ih6Tzxd3LSUWjG8BKfEozjYlofbDulaTvyzjZJ_bwvbDTeCELDUXdIHvC6NZHufYBnxhNT9hl6bTx-UuU9Cp-SbjCBLI2UTL41QzUEx0Yo8vvbHlqSwV80A' alt='Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s president, photographed at the White House in 2023.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Named targets: Sanctions explicitly name Petro&#x27;s wife, Verónica del Socorro Alcocer García, his son Nicolás, and Interior Minister Armando Benedetti as designated individuals .</li><li>Legal measures: The Treasury&#x27;s package freezes any assets the designated people hold in U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits American persons and firms from conducting business with them, effectively cutting them off from U.S. financial interactions .</li><li>Official rationale: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said cocaine production in Colombia has surged to the &#x27;highest rate in decades&#x27; and accused President Petro of allowing cartels to flourish, framing the sanctions as an effort to protect Americans .</li><li>Diplomatic rarity: Analysts noted it is highly unusual for the United States to sanction a sitting head of state from a traditional regional partner, signaling a significant break with long-standing bilateral practice .</li><li>Colombian response: Petro rejected the U.S. action as arbitrary, said his government has made record seizures of cocaine, and framed the measures as political retaliation rather than evidence of collusion .</li></ul><blockquote>President Petro has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity. - Scott Bessent</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. Treasury / Trump administration: The administration says the sanctions are necessary to stop a surge in cocaine reaching the United States and to hold leaders accountable for allowing trafficking to flourish .
