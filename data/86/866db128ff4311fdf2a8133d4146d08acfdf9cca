<p>European Union leaders arrived in New Delhi ahead of India’s Republic Day events and an EU‑India summit this week, as both sides say negotiations are nearing the finish line on a long-discussed free-trade agreement. EU officials framed the planned accord as a boost for open markets at a time of tougher global trade conditions, including US tariffs and Chinese export controls. Beyond trade, the talks also include a broader strategic agenda, with some reports pointing to an accompanying defense or security element aimed at deepening cooperation. If completed, the deal would knit together two large economies with growing commercial ties and a shared interest in predictable rules for business.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7VeNfoX0WIWUuraLe67qspQX8i7KKz4KX_yzXeqZwsxJWGZi-yXwSYal6ttY_cMU0IorZ2qBccBFPkaJ5ulrsGtE022E6tGiZ3jmDAmRhIfP' alt='European Council President Antonio Costa at an EU leaders’ summit in Brussels (Dec. 2025).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Republic Day role: European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are slated to be chief guests at India’s Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi ahead of the summit.</li><li>Trade scale: EU figures cited in reporting put EU‑India goods trade at about €120 billion in 2024, plus roughly €60 billion in services trade.</li><li>Two-decade talks: The free-trade negotiations have run for nearly two decades, and multiple outlets describe them as in the “final stretch” or nearing conclusion.</li><li>Why now: Both sides are looking to open or diversify markets amid external pressure from US tariffs and Chinese export controls, according to reporting.</li><li>Economic outlook: India is on track to become the world’s fourth-largest economy this year based on IMF projections cited in reporting, a factor the EU sees as increasing India’s long-term market importance.</li></ul><blockquote>We are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement, - Ursula von der Leyen</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Commission: Ursula von der Leyen presented EU‑India cooperation as a constructive model for engagement in a “fractured world,” ahead of the summit and Republic Day events.
