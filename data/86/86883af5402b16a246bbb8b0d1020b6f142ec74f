<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Returning home I saw and composed some #poetry to the glorious sunset framing a grove of trees.
</p>
        <p>While driving home, I saw a grove of trees whose head was lit by the setting
sun; a sun that had not been seen for what seems a month.</p>
<p>I grabbed my voice recorder and narrated the first two lines and filled in the
remaining two lines.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>Peach pink corral crowns<br />
Bald winter trees<br />
Once kings, now slumbering<br />
As Arthur of Avalon.<br /></p>
</div>
