         <p>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More
information in the announcement I posted:

<p>For this meeting, I learnt from Rudy about a bunch of geeky and fun
issues. We discussed what it means to be “living in Emacs”. It takes a
certain mindset to experiment with your tools and to understand what
is going on. You eventually push against the boundaries because you
take things to their full potential. Our talk covers bugs and some
in-development feature of Org mode. Then we explore more themes that
speak to the hacker’s heart: Scheme and Fennel for developing games
within certain constraints, simple cooking, experimenting with pizza,
and more!</p>
