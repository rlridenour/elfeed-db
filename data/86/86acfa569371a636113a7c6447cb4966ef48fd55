<p>From an appreciation of Ernest Rutherford by C.P. Snow in the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1958/11/the-age-of-rutherford/642875/">November 1958</a> issue of <em>The Atlantic</em>:</p>

Worldly success? He loved every minute of it: flattery, titles, the company of the high official world. He said in a speech: &#8216;As I was standing in the drawing room at Trinity, a clergyman came in. And I said to him: &#8220;I&#8217;m Lord Rutherford.&#8221; And he said to me: &#8220;I&#8217;m the Archbishop of York.&#8221; And I don&#8217;t suppose either of us believed the other.&#8217;
