<li>Shark power in a handheld vacuum</li>
<li>Refurbished (and therefore very cheap)</li>
<li>Especially good for pet hair</li>
<li>Is it Mac-compatible: Oh yeah, this’ll clean up all the hair your Mac sheds</li>
</ul><h1>Handheld</h1><p>They’re running an exciting promo on this WandVac over at Costco right now! You can get it for $20 off, making the final cost a cool 80 bucks!</p>
<p>Not bad, huh?</p>
<p>But also, more than double our price for this refurbished model.</p>
<p>So, it really comes down to how much you care whether your vacuum is ‘brand new’ or ‘like brand new.’ Of course, all things being equal, you’d prefer the ‘brand new’ version. But, once again, all things are not equal. One is more than twice the other.</p>
<p>Which really highlights how good our prices are, doesn’t it? We’re not comparing how much we’re selling this for with some ludicrous MSRP or the price tag at some weird boutique store. It’s Costco for crying out loud! And this thing’s <em>on sale</em> there!</p>
<p>Even on Amazon, it’s still more than 20 bucks more.</p>
<p>We really are the best, aren’t we?</p>
<p>But enough tooting our own horn. We should probably tell you what this thing is.</p>
<p>It’s a vacuum. A little one. Like, a handheld one.</p>
<p>Look, you can get the best full-sized vacuum ever–A SEBO or a Miele or whatever–and it’ll be great for those days when you clean the whole house.</p>
<p>But, when your kid spills a bunch of dry cereal, are you gonna want to wheel that thing out?</p>
<p>Or when you need to vacuum all the golden retriever hair off the backseat of your car before picking up some friends from the airport–are you going to want your push vacuum for that?</p>
<p>Or when it’s time to get on the step stool and suck up some cobwebs in the corner of the room? Or when it’s time to get down on your knees suck up some dust that’s <em>just</em> beyond where your push vacuum can maneuver? Or–</p>
<p>Well, you get it.</p>
<p>What we’re saying is this is the perfect supplementary vacuum: for jobs that aren’t enough work for a big vacuum, but too much work for a broom. And yes, calling something a ‘supplementary vacuum’ might not be a smart marketing decision if you’re selling it for $100, or $80, or even $66.</p>
<p>But at $34, it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>So buy this little vacuum. You’ll use it.</p>
