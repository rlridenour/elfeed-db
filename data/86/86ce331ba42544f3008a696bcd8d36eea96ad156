<li>A pair of powerful little fans that sit on a surface and are not meant to be worn around your neck, because that would be ridiculous.</li>
<li>We will disavow this writeup later when we inevitably offer a personal fan that you <em>do</em> wear around your neck.</li>
<li>Flexible cloth blades (for safety).</li>
<li>Backed by a 3-year Vornado warranty</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita? It can make a margarita a much breezier experience.</li>
</ul><h1>This is fine.</h1><p>There are plenty of things in life that aren’t necessarily <em>harmful</em>, but that we all just sort of agree should be avoided because we’re trying to have a reasonably respectable society here.</p>
<p>We don’t drape ourselves in velvet like George Costanza, despite how comfy that would be. We don’t wear fanny packs every day, even though it’s an objectively superior way to hold stuff. And we don’t fully recline in those massage chairs at the mall, even though nothing’s stopping us.</p>
<p>You know. Because society.</p>
<p>Anyway, we say all that so that we can say this: unless you have some very specific personal needs, those mini fans that hang around your neck are simply a step too far. Technically they’re just the modern equivalent of the paper hand fans that fancy ladies used to use, but something about making a device out of neon plastic and charging it via USB robs it of that coquettish elegance that you see in old paintings or whatever. Suddenly it’s less “coy debutante cooling herself across the room” and more “overheated parent standing in a 40 minute line at an amusement park wondering where it all went wrong.”</p>
<p>So, sure…we get it. But just like you can save the velvet for pajamas and not wear it out to eat, you can also enjoy the comfort of a personal fan without walking around wearing it like an accessory.</p>
<p>Today’s deal is that. This fan isn’t personal in the same sense as a personal pizza is personal—it isn’t made for you to enjoy alone in your car while you’re parked around the corner from your house after telling your family you’re stuck in traffic. It’s personal in the sense that you can keep it at your desk and it’ll provide efficient and effective cooling just for you without crossing the line into flitting about your day, buzzing like an electronic insect.</p>
<p>These are plenty powerful and easy to direct the air exactly where you need it to be. They don’t take up a lot of space, and the fan blades are made of soft cloth, so even if you do get hot and desperate enough to shove your face overly close to the thing, you aren’t going to damage yourself too badly (probably).</p>
<p>So basically the point here is that if wearing head-to-toe velvet while sporting a fanny pack at work is a choice on par with a dangling neck fan, this rad little desk accessory is the functionally equivalent but less embarrassing option, like a business casual outfit and an understated backpack.</p>
<p>Did we mention we’re sending you two? You can cool off in stereo.</p>
