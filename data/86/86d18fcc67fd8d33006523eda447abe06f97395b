<p>Today, Apple took a shellacking in the Epic lawsuit with the court finding the company in violation of its earlier 2021 App-Store-related injunction. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.1508.0_2.pdf">80-page ruling</a> did not mince words:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Internally, Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction, but Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. <em>Cook chose poorly</em>.”<br>&#8211; <em>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers</em></p>
