<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 2 licenses ($14.95 value each) for <a href="https://stclairsoft.com/AppTamer/index.html">App Tamer</a>. That&rsquo;s right, another chance at App Tamer! Got unruly applications? App Tamer helps you take control of your CPU by controlling how much access your apps have to it. Throttle apps that take up too much CPU, speeding up the apps you&rsquo;re using most.</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>App Tamer will automatically slow down or pause your applications whenever you&rsquo;re not using them, greatly reducing their CPU use. App Tamer even comes pre-configured to automatically reduce the CPU and battery usage of Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome, Spotlight, Time Machine, Photoshop, Illustrator, Word and many other applications.</p>
