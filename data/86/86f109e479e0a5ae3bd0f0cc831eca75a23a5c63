<p>In his spare time over the past couple of years, philosopher <a href="http://ivo.pezlar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivo Pezlar</a> (Institute of Philosophy of the Czech Academy of Sciences) has been developing a new video game that combines Tetris-style gameplay with truth tables from classical propositional logic.<span id="more-53284"></span></p>

<p>The game, <em>Truth Finder: A Quest of Logic</em>, has just been released in beta. It works on desktop and laptop computers (using arrow keys, the space bar, and the enter key), and it&#8217;s free. You can play it <a href="https://ivopezlar.itch.io/truthfinder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Pezlar writes, &#8220;The main goal was to make truth tables playable without compromising any of the underlying logic, so it could be also used for teaching and educational purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a player, your task is to direct falling colored tiles&#8212;green for true and red for false&#8212;onto variables and logical operators in order to render correct the truth values for the sentences on each line, and to do so before the falling tiles pile up to the top of the board. There are tutorial levels to walk you through the game play, and 100 levels of game play.</p>
<p>You can view the instruction manual <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/18wsh8hntadzbriect6sp/truthfinder_manual.pdf?rlkey=v2stecyahnuwi1e0tzgyuk9n4&amp;e=1&amp;st=e2bnaofk&amp;dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and a trailer for the game, below. I tried it out briefly this morning and it works well and is thoughtfully constructed. Logic teachers, have your students play it and report back.</p>
