Apple designed a ChatGPT-like app to help its engineers test the overhauled version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-26/apple-builds-a-chatgpt-like-app-to-help-test-the-revamped-siri">Bloomberg</a></em>. Unfortunately, the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; app isn't going to be released to the public, and it's strictly for internal testing.<br/>

The app is being used to test new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that Apple has planned, such as more contextual awareness, an ability to do more in and between apps, and deeper integration with personal data.<br/>
<br/>
It is said to look similar to other chatbot apps, organized into multiple conversations across different topics. The app is able to remember and reference past chats, and it supports extended conversations.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been working on a smarter version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; since the launch of iOS 18. The company initially planned to debut an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; as part of the update, but ended up <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">delaying the functionality</a> until 2026 because it did not meet Apple's standards.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; plan was scrapped, and Apple decided to entirely overhaul &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; with second-generation architecture, speeding up an LLM transition. The upcoming version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that Apple plans to release will use advanced large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other AI chatbots.<br/>
<br/>
LLM &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to hold continuous conversations, provide human-like responses to questions, and complete more complex tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is on track to launch the LLM version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in early 2026, likely as part of an iOS 26.4 update that could come in March. That will see &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; introduced a full year after Apple originally wanted to launch the updated version of the personal assistant.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of next year, Apple is planning to unveil a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/siri-redesign-report/">new look for Siri</a>, giving it a more humanoid design that could be similar to the Mac's Finder logo.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has held talks with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google, and it may use a third-party company to power the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; rather than relying on its in-house AI models.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/26/apple-llm-siri-app/">Apple Testing LLM Siri With ChatGPT-Like App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-testing-llm-siri-with-chatgpt-like-app.2467638/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
