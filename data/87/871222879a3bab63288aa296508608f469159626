<p>Depending on how you look at it, I’ve either already retired or have no intention of retiring for a very long time. My friend, Jim Eagar, however, has been there and he’s got some real insight. He’s now coaching folks <a href="https://www.retirereinvented.com/retirement-coaching/">at Retirement Reinvented.</a></p>



<p>What makes this interesting is that Jim&#8217;s approach is not about figuring out whether you have enough money to retire, but instead how to mentally handle retirement. I wish him luck.</p>
