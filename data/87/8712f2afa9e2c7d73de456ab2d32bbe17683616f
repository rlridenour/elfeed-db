<p>Bill Maher personifies the difference between a liberal (which he is) and a leftist (which he isn’t). But he’s been a stridently vocal critic of Trump <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/donald-trump-withdraws-bill-maher-432675/">since long before Trump even ran for president</a>. Maher was the first person on television <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/will-donald-trump-leave-office-peacefully-bill-maher-president-loses-2020-election-landslide-1466447">to correctly predict that Trump, if he lost the 2020 election, would attempt to remain in office</a>. Maher and Trump, however, are mutual friends with Kid Rock, and Rock arranged for Trump to invite Maher to the White House for a private dinner. UFC chief and Meta board member Dana White was also there. A decade ago even imagining this guest list for a White House dinner would have been a warning that you ought to lay off the drugs. Today, this is normal.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxlopbcfXpQ">this clip from his show this weekend</a>, Maher reports on the dinner. What it was like. What <em>Trump</em> was like. Turns out, in private, Trump turns it off. He was normal. Or, well, normal for Donald Trump. He wasn’t what we see in public. I find that fascinating. Not exculpatory. Just interesting. Is he “<em>They’re eating the dogs, they’re eating the cats!</em>” crazy 24 hours a day, or just when the cameras are on?</p>

<p>Some on the left are absolutely losing their shit over Maher for this. I don’t get it. This is the single most interesting report on Trump I’ve seen in <em>years</em> because it’s real. Maher didn’t come out of the dinner brainwashed. He’s not now saying Trump is doing a good job. He’s not now saying things are in any way OK. He spent his whole monologue before this report rightfully skewering Trump’s humiliating weeklong tariffs tantrum. After the report, Maher interviewed total nutjob Steve Bannon and literally shoved a copy of the Constitution in Bannon’s face when Bannon started blathering about Trump running for a third term in 2028. From Maher’s preface to his report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh my god Bill, are you going to say something nice about him?
What I’m going to do is report exactly what happened. You decide
what you think about it. And if that’s not enough pure Trump hate
for you I don’t give a fuck.”</p>
</blockquote>
