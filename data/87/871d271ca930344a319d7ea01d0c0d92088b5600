<li>Alessandro Farace explains his Obsidian flashcard workflow in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alessandrofv.bsky.social/post/3lcdno6i3he2o" target="_blank">this detailed Bluesky thread</a>. He uses 5 plugins while my flashcard method uses none. Each way of doing things has its own pros and cons.</li>
<li>Nerdy Momo Cat answers the question<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Can you do with just an Apple-based digital information setup?” with <a href="https://nerdymomocat.github.io/posts/apps-by-apple-ecosystem/" target="_blank">this extensive, well-structured list of apps</a>. It is beautifully opinionated and mentions some extensions and keyboard shortcuts I either didn’t know about or had forgotten.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZnlUAPccaA" target="_blank">This 39 second video</a> reminded me of the biggest Why behind the pursuit of productivity: gaining the time needed to be a positive presence in the life of someone else. I do enjoy a regular wakeup to the fact that <em>productivity is not and end in and of itself</em>.</li>

<h2 id="its-that-time-of-year-again">It’s that time of year again!</h2>
<p>Whether or not you celebrate Christmas, this time of year has a certain feel about it. We’re living one more ending while preparing for yet another beginning, and many of us are carrying on family traditions that have become a part of who we are. I wrote you a brief <a href="https://ellanew.com/2024-12-06-christmas-kindness-carol">Christmas message</a>, where you’ll find a poorly engineered but heartfelt Christmas carol (sung by yours truly in 3-part harmony), and a line drawing of an Australian Christmas Nativity drawn by my daughter.</p>
