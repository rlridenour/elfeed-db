<p>Iran appeared to return to an uneasy calm after days of nationwide antigovernment unrest and a deadly crackdown, with residents and multiple outlets reporting few new street protests as security forces maintained a heavy presence and internet access remained cut off. Iranian state media said about 3,000 people were arrested, while outside assessments cited thousands detained and described widespread fear and disillusionment in Tehran. Tensions remained high as a senior hard-line cleric, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, publicly called for executions of detained demonstrators and issued threats aimed at President Donald Trump, underscoring the leadership’s hard line even as the streets quieted.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/vT2uZgzVHAl8B9BY4aThq7t2NqLY9omQrzXP04uRA8EWnFX13JNYGrYRFOnNl2sJlzyCo-BEMYaMLv9MmWqQbMwF8FgSZDDfZ_c8e3zlKaSaqSzBDCA0wwFlORkTNuT4_4RqrfVW8aHpFRUVFA_Ufmm6IJqlrelnODdcZSnwk11d5mbcAqgM0_4YfLwyD0179Fq_CpW4szU' alt='A burned bus at Sadeghieh Square in Tehran after protests were largely subdued.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Internet blackout: A complete internet shutdown has lasted about a week, cutting most of Iran’s roughly 90 million people off from the outside world and making verification of events and casualty claims difficult.</li><li>Trump’s red lines: President Trump has described two triggers for possible U.S. action: executions of detainees and the killing of peaceful protesters, while recently signaling a more conciliatory posture in public comments.</li><li>How streets retaken: Accounts of the security response describe an intensive, coordinated effort to reassert control over public spaces, raising questions about how and when the protest movement might reemerge.</li><li>Funerals continue: Funerals were held in cities including Isfahan and Hamadan for people killed during the unrest, with authorities describing the events as “riots”.</li><li>Call for intervention: Iran’s exiled crown prince urged U.S. military intervention, highlighting divisions among opposition figures over what outside support should look like.</li></ul><blockquote>I greatly respect the fact that all scheduled hangings, which were to take place yesterday (Over 800 of them), have been cancelled by the leadership of Iran.
