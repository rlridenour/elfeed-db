Apple's disappointing iPhone Air sales are causing major Chinese mobile vendors to scrap or freeze their own ultra-thin phone projects, according to reports coming out of Asia.<br/>

Since the ‌iPhone Air‌ launched in September, there have been reports of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/iphone-air-supply-chain-cuts/">poor sales and manufacturing cuts</a>, while Apple's supply chain has scaled back shipments and production. <br/>
<br/>
Apple supplier Foxconn has reportedly dismantled all of its production lines for the ‌iPhone Air‌, while Luxshare, another supplier, stopped production at the end of October. <br/>
<br/>
As a result of the device's poor reception among consumers, rival smartphone manufacturers including Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and others have either canned or adjusted their development plans for Air-style models, and reallocated eSIM solutions intended for the devices to other production lines.<br/>
<br/>
Xiaomi reportedly planned a "true Air model" to rival Apple's offering, while Vivo targeted thinness within its mid-range S series. Both companies are now said to have halted related projects but have yet to officially comment.<br/>
<br/>
Apple relied on the iPhone Air's new look to generate excitement – it's the first major redesign of the iPhone since the iPhone X introduced Face ID and an all-display front in 2017. However, achieving a super-thin 5.6 mm profile required trade-offs. The iPhone Air uses a smaller battery and a single rear camera, yet still carries a premium price. <br/>
<br/>
Starting at &#36;999, it seems too expensive for what many buyers view as style over substance. It sits only &#36;100 below the &#36;1,099 iPhone 17 Pro, which offers a triple-lens camera system and far better battery life.<br/>
<br/>
The tepid consumer response is also said to have forced Apple back to the drawing board: a report from <em>The Information</em> claims Apple has delayed the second-generation iPhone Air while it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/11/report-delayed-iphone-air-2-second-camera/">redesigns the device</a> to potentially fit in a second camera and improve battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently it's been a similar story for Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, the Korean company's equivalent ultra-thin offering. Samsung has reportedly <a href="https://m.newspim.com/news/view/20251016000725">cancelled</a> the Galaxy S26 Edge and halted the production of the Galaxy S25 Edge, owing to poor sales.<br/>
