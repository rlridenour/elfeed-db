<p><em>Quick note for those who don&rsquo;t know about Docker:</em> <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-docker">Docker</a> is a program that lets me take packaged-up programs (called <em>images</em> or <em>containers</em>) and run them without having to worry much about dependencies.</p>
<p>Today I decided to upgrade my version of <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost Blog</a>. I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/">Docker image</a> on a Digital Ocean droplet. Updating should be simple, I thought. I would take down the blog then spin it back up again after pulling down the latest Docker image. I ran <code>docker stop ghost-blog</code>, removed the container with <code>docker rm ghost-blog</code> then ran <code>docker pull ghost:latest</code>. The container came down without a problem.</p>
<p>Then the trouble began.</p>
<p>I tried restarting the image:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -d --name ghost-blog -p 80:2368 -v /home/ghost/blog-data:/var/lib/ghost/content ghost
</code></pre>
<p>But when I ran <code>docker ps</code>, no docker containers were running. I tried looking at the log of the <code>ghost-blog</code> container and was greeted with this message:</p>
<pre><code>tar: /var/lib/ghost/content.orig: Cannot open: No such file or directory
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
tar: This does not look like a tar archive
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
</code></pre>
<p>Hhmmm… I tried creating <code>/var/lib/ghost/content.orig</code>, but that didn&rsquo;t help. I then copied my <code>blog-data/</code> folder, blew the old folder away, then tried running again, but to no avail.</p>
<p>I was out of ideas, so I decided to inquire at the great oracle of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=docker&#43;ghost&#43;tar%3A&#43;%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fghost%2Fcontent.orig%3A&#43;Cannot&#43;open%3A&#43;No&#43;such&#43;file&#43;or&#43;directory&#43;tar%3A&#43;Error&#43;is&#43;not&#43;recoverable%3A&#43;exiting&#43;now&#43;tar%3A&#43;This&#43;does&#43;not&#43;look&#43;like&#43;a&#43;tar&#43;archive&#43;tar%3A&#43;Exiting&#43;with&#43;failure&#43;status&#43;due&#43;to&#43;previous&#43;errors&amp;bext=msl&amp;atb=v43-6_s&amp;ia=web">DuckDuckGo</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/docker-library/ghost/issues/69">first result</a> was this lovely issue on GitHub that covered <em>exactly</em> the problem I was facing.</p>
<p>I created the directory specified and was able to fire up the docker container without a problem. I think I must have made an incompatible upgrade. ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>Running around as the root user of a system is always dangerous. I was painfully reminded of that today when I accidentally deleted my backup folder instead of moving its contents to the original location. 🤦🏻‍♂️Oops.</p>
<p><em>Fortunately</em>, I had made another backup of all my content saved as a JSON file on my laptop. I fired up the docker container, opened to the website in a web browser, and imported all my old files. Day saved. 😌</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately</em> I lost all my configurations. Not that there was a <em>lot</em>, but I did loose the Disqus integration as well as some settings for me as an administrator. Alas. I&rsquo;ll fix the comments sometime later. Probably <em>after</em> midterms…</p>
<p>So, lessons: make backups. Then don&rsquo;t delete the backups.</p>
<p>I <em>am</em> enjoying the Ghost blog. It&rsquo;s pretty minimal and doesn&rsquo;t get in my way. I just wish I had been a little more careful today.</p>
