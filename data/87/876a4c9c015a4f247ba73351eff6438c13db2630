<p>Many, many years ago, at my childhood house in the Santa Cruz mountains, I grabbed a shovel and started to dig a hole.</p>



<p>Why? Unclear. I was six or seven. I&#8217;d seen what my Dad could do with a shovel, so one afternoon…. I started digging, and by the time evening approached, my Dad walked out, &#8220;So, wha&#8217;cha doing there?&#8221;</p>



<p>At the time of the hole intervention, I&#8217;d been at my hole digging for a couple of hours, and while that sounds like a lot of time, I was only two or three feet deep in a hole maybe the size of a picnic table. The removed dirt was tossed carelessly in every direction.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m digging a hole.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see that. Wha&#8217;cha planning on doing with that hole?&#8221;</p>



<p>No real answer at the ready. Like <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-stick-in-the-stream/">pulling a stick from a stream</a>, I was mostly enthralled with the act of digging a hole. I dodged his question, &#8220;Yeah, I think I&#8217;m going to need some wooden columns here at some point. Ya&#8217;know, to hold the ceiling up when I get that far.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dad, &#8220;Uh huh.&#8221; The hole was three or four feet deep — barely above my knees. And it was getting dark.</p>



<p>I continued, &#8220;And I am worried about moisture…. ya&#8217;know? Dripping from the ceiling.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dad, &#8220;Yeah. I get that.&#8221; <strong>Barely</strong> to my seven-year old knees.</p>



<p>The digging continued for another hour. I&#8217;d discovered blisters (no gloves) and also dirt was now  falling back into the hole with each shovel-full (no solid dirt extraction plan), but my Dad stood there the entire time. Question continued:</p>



<p>Dad: &#8220;Maybe we should get you a wheelbarrow? You could move the dirt into the ravine.&#8221; I ignored him and kept digging.</p>



<p>Me: &#8220;Dad, do we have a wooden chest? Where could we keep my stuff in the cave? Like a treasure chest?&#8221; Dad, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure we could figure that out.&#8221;</p>



<p>You think you know how this story ends, and you&#8217;re mostly correct. We covered my picnic-table-sized shallow hole with a piece of plywood to &#8220;make sure no one falls in.&#8221; My plan was to finish digging the following day, but I have no memory of that picnic-table-sized hole after that night. I&#8217;m sure I visited it the next day, but the interest had vanished.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t remember this story because of the picnic-table-sized shallow hole; I remember this story because of my Dad. He walked out of the house and found his young son digging a random hole on the property. No plan, poorly equipped, but enthusiastically digging. He stood there asking questions, not judging. Supporting the dream.</p>



<p>Just letting me gleefully dig.</p>



<p>He taught me that no one knows where inspiration comes from — only that it&#8217;s fragile, invaluable, and fleeting.</p>
