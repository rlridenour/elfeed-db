<p>Back in 2008, <a href="https://bobboilen.info/">Bob Boilen</a> (host of <em>All Songs Considered</em>) and NPR music critic Stephen Thompson attended a noisy concert where they struggled to hear Laura Gibson perform. Jokingly, Thompson suggested that Gibson perform at Boilen’s office desk instead. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Az1xWhdl0">She did</a>. And, with that, the NPR Tiny Desk Concert was born. Since then, more than 1,300 musical acts have performed their own stripped-down, authentic shows in the cramped confines of NPR’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. That includes everyone from <a href="https://youtu.be/FvVnP8G6ITs?si=degfq_uZ2Y2zM1aX">Taylor Swift</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y38qQRg3UDI">Dua Lipa</a>, to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcFHOGZ-6aM">Pixies</a>, the Grateful Dead’s <a href="https://youtu.be/4l_gUwdPrNY?si=V9z3jdnXZn57pojw">Bob Weir</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjFo6l4c-oc&amp;list=RDSjFo6l4c-oc&amp;start_radio=1">Gary Clark Jr</a>. In the video above, <em>Architectural Digest</em> takes you behind the scenes, showing the set where the magic happens. There you can see “a real desk in a real office, surrounded by shelves packed with priceless mementos left by artists–from Adele’s water bottle to Sabrina Carpenter’s martini glass and even Chappell Roan’s wig.” And you can meet the team behind the production, while learning how Tiny Desk became a beloved series. Below watch a complete playlist of all Tiny Desk Concerts. Enjoy!</p>
