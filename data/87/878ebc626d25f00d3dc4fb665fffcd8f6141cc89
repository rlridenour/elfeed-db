The Emoji Game was initially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-news-plus-emoji-game/">unveiled at WWDC</a> earlier this year as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> feature, but to coincide with World Emoji Day today, Apple has released the game for all &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;+ subscribers running iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, macOS 15.4, or newer.<br/>
<br/>
The game shows words and blank spots with a selection of emoji and emoji combinations below, and the player needs to drag an emoji into the blank spot to fill in the word. If the word is "disappear," for example, you would drag a pear to the blank spot in the word. Pear could also be used to finish off the word "fruitful." The Emoji Game also uses <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a> to offer unique emojis.<br/>
<br/>
The game is limited to &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;+ subscribers. &zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;+ is priced at &#36;12.99 per month, but the whole family can use the service. Apple has been aiming to increase the number of games that are available, and the app also features Crossword, Quartiles, and Sudoku.<br/>
<br/>
New Emoji Game puzzles will be released on a daily basis. The game is currently available in the U.S. and for English-speaking users in Canada. It can be accessed from the Following tab in the News app. Results can be tracked on Game Center leaderboards.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/">Apple News</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/apple-news-emoji-game-now-available/">Apple News+&#039;s All-New &#039;Emoji Game&#039; Now Available</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-news-s-all-new-emoji-game-now-available.2461682/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
