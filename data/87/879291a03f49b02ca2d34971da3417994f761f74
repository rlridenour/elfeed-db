<p>President Trump is hosting Syrian interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa at the White House on Monday for formal talks that U.S. officials and Syrian aides say will cover Damascus joining a U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State and requests to lift remaining sanctions on war‑torn Syria. The visit is the first official trip by a Syrian head of state to Washington since 1946 and caps a rapid, unlikely political ascent for al-Sharaa from rebel leader to president. U.S. and international press note the meeting as a significant diplomatic opening between Washington and Damascus.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/4wV59Do0WIpVlNJ5i5BxKNILJzzd4-KboYORp_TLhN8K5m38T4W31nr9vZw8UC52F61YGk4xgeoOLU_-sLJnmfVaYfqg392dQUrEvvOiyovsxfVV8CkvzA2WCT-ApiwFCQiNxFu38fma55fHW_lzWTQj-3J6PBBXyxSqOzBBfA' alt='Ahmad al-Sharaa, Syria&#x27;s interim president, ahead of his White House visit' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>U.S. bounty history: Last year the U.S. had offered a $10 million bounty for al-Sharaa; he had previously been detained by U.S. forces over links to insurgent groups, underscoring his rapid rehabilitation into diplomacy</li><li>Electoral test: Foreign Policy frames al-Sharaa’s recent election as his first major democratic test as president, a development Western outlets are watching for legitimacy and consolidation of power</li><li>Sanctions push: Al-Sharaa is expected to press President Trump for a full lifting of the remaining sanctions that were imposed during Syria’s 13-year civil war, arguing they are no longer justified</li><li>Diplomatic turnaround: Regional coverage describes the White House visit as capping a major turnaround that would see Syria rejoin a U.S.-led international effort to combat Islamic State remnants</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House / U.S. officials: U.S. hosts the Syrian leader to pursue security cooperation against Islamic State and to discuss normalizing ties.
