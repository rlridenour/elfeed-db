Ookla, the network intelligence company known for its Speedtest tool, today published the <a href="https://www.ookla.com/articles/iphone-c1-modem-performance-q2-q3-2025">results of its second iPhone 16e cellular speed test</a>.<br/>
<br/>

In short, Ookla found that the iPhone 16e with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">Apple's custom-designed C1 modem</a> "performs similarly" to the standard iPhone 16 with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X71 modem in the "vast majority of markets" that it examined.<br/>
<br/>
However, results sometimes varied considerably based on carrier and country.<br/>
<br/>
Ookla said the median 5G download speed for the standard iPhone 16 on T-Mobile's network in the U.S. was 317 Mbps, compared to 252 Mbps on the iPhone 16e. However, on an unspecified Spanish network, it said the iPhone 16e achieved a median 5G download speed of 139 Mbps, topping the iPhone 16 at 110 Mbps.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, Ookla said the iPhone 16e performs "comparatively" to the iPhone 16 for 5G connectivity, which reinforces its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/iphone-16e-c1-modem-test/">earlier March findings</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 16e users can rest assured that Apple's first 5G modem is no slouch, which is good news ahead of Apple's special event tomorrow, as the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">also expected to be equipped with the C1 modem</a>.<br/>
