Well <a href="https://dailynous.com/2016/06/07/2000-spaces-for-10000-papers-why-everything-gets-rejected-referees-are-exhausted-guest-post-by-neil-sinhababu/">here&#8217;s one statement of it</a>.</p>
<p>In the culmination of a four-part series on the problem at his <a href="https://dkfrubio.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a>&#8212;the last part is <a href="https://dkfrubio.substack.com/p/refereeing-in-philosophy-pt-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and includes links to the previous ones&#8212;<a href="https://www.danielkfrubio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Rubio</a> (Toronto Metropolitan) focuses on what he identifies as &#8220;the inefficiency in editors seeking referees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how he describes the problem:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Most editors have a process like the following: after they read a paper, they ask people in their network who they think would be good. If no one bites, and they run out of suggested referees from their declines, they go to databases like PhilPapers (as suggested <a href="https://dailynous.com/2022/02/21/how-editors-can-use-philpeople-find-referees/" rel="">here</a>) or look at authors in the paper’s footnotes to find more people. This makes it easy for people to fall through the cracks, or for editors to ask people at the wrong time. There has been a <a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/11/12/philosophers-available-to-referee/" rel="">recent attempt</a> at further improvement, in the form of a public spreadsheet where people can indicate their availability. But a google sheet is a clunky interface, and it relies on people knowing about it and regularly updating their status.</em></p>
<p>His recommendation is a database to which editors add minimal descriptions of papers that have passed desk review, and from which registered users can select papers to referee:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>It would be better if available philosophers could volunteer to referee papers. It’s much easier for a journal (or journals) to maintain a viewable database of submissions than for the profession as a whole to maintain a database of available referees. And willing referees would not have to wait to be asked in order to contribute; they could simply find a paper that looked like a good fit and volunteer. This may not eliminate all of the inefficiencies in the referee search process, but it would take a big bite out of them.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Of course, the details matter. Tentatively, I suggest the following: once a paper has passed desk review at a journal, it is added to the database with a number, subdisciplines, and keyword tags from a standard menu such as the one PhilPapers offers. This will preserve anonymity and prevent any gaming of the system by friends/associates. Registered users (with some sort of screening criteria, as a first pass a Ph.D from a recognized institution) can then search by topic for papers within their specializations. They can then volunteer to referee a paper via a small form indicating their expected completion time-frame. This sends a message to the editor who posted it, who can then see if the volunteer fits their criteria for a referee for the paper. If the stars align, the referee receives the paper. If not, it stays up. Once the journal has enough referees lined up, the paper goes off the database.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>This would make the search for referees much easier. But why would referees volunteer? Some may because of intrinsic features of the work, or in order to influence the development of the literature. But an additional incentive would be good. My suggestion: refereeing more papers should earn people more journal submissions. Perhaps by default, journals allow one submission per year. This will make room for people who cannot referee enough for legitimate reasons (e.g. they are too junior, doing other service work, or have various life circumstances such as illness or hardship). But in order to submit to the journal more than once per year, someone must generate enough referee reports for them to offset the ones they generate (plus some, to make up for the free submission everyone gets). </em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s one approach.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.goodthoughts.blog/p/a-quick-fix-for-the-referee-crisis?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post at his blog</a>, <a href="https://yetterchappell.net/Richard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Y. Chappell</a> (Miami) says that the refereeing problem in philosophy stems from two facts:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>(i) There is no personal cost incurred when you add to the reviewing burden (by submitting a paper to a journal); and</em><br />
<em>(ii) There is no reward for doing work (i.e., serving as a referee) that relieves the reviewing burden—nor for doing a good job of it.</em></p>
<p>In light of these facts, he proposes the following solution:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Journals should charge hefty submission fees, and use the money to pay editors and referees for their service.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>This fixes the incentives instantly. It turns refereeing from a chore into an opportunity. And the desire to receive more such opportunities in future creates an incentive to do a good job. It also creates an incentive against flooding the system with low-quality submissions: if you had to pay, say, $300 per submission, you’re likely to be more discerning about which papers you send in.</em></p>
<p>Chappell anticipates some objections to his proposal. Here are two, but he covers more at his post.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“I can’t afford to pay that much to submit my papers to journals.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;"><em>Referee a few times and it should all balance out. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“Won’t monetary incentives encourage people to referee too much, and do a superficial, sloppy job of it?”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;"><em>The hope would be that editors track the quality of referee reports, and use these track records to influence who they do or don’t invite to referee in future. (At worst, this may still be an improvement over the status quo, where it’s not uncommon for people to do a superficial, sloppy job while refereeing too little! )</em></p>
<p>Thoughts on these, readers? Anyone want to start implementing either of them?</p>
