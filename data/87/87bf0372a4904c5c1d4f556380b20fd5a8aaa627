Following the debut of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup on Tuesday, Apple quietly updated its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup so that the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; is now sold only in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16">128GB configuration</a> for &#36;699. The previous storage tiers of 256GB and 512GB for the base &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; have been discontinued. <br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus retains slightly more flexibility by remaining available in both 128GB and 256GB versions, although its 512GB tier has also been removed.<br/>
<br/>
The change makes sense for Apple's marketing strategy. Given that all &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models now start at 256GB, maintaining a 256GB &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; tier would have created product overlap and potentially impacted sales of the newer model.<br/>
<br/>
It also streamlines Apple's manufacturing and inventory management, and will likely encourage customers who need more storage to either choose the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus or upgrade directly to the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
