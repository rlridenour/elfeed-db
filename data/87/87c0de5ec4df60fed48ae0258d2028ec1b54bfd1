 

<p>I download almost every text editor which is released. Every outlining program also gets my interest. Over the years, I have played with and used for significant amounts of time a whole host of programs. The advantage is that I have a lot of fun doing that<a href="#footnote-138D" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-138D" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The disadvantage? There are great solutions which I already have access to, which do not get used at all. Am searching for perfection when perfectly all right is right under my nose.</p>
<p>Today I am going to talk about one such solution.</p>

<p>I purchased <a href="https://www.taskpaper.com/" target="_blank">TaskPaper</a> the week it was released, sometime in the Fall of 2007. I updated to version 2 when it was available and then to version 3. It has been on my hard drive for all that time. I have used it off and on. But never concentrated on it enough to make it the main driver for my lists. Instead, I have used dedicated outlining programs like <a href="http://a-sharp.com/opal/opal.html" target="_blank">Opal</a>, or <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner" target="_blank">OmniOuliner</a> for making and maintaining lists.</p>
<p>Over the years I have moved to a test file focused workflow. TaskPaper files are plain text files which are accessible in any text editor. Moving to TaskPaper and using it for all my lists made sense<a href="#footnote-238D" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-238D" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In TaskPaper, I made an effort to simplify my life, I decided to consolidate a couple of things. My diary and my lists. I changed my “single file for every day diary workflow” to one file for the whole year.</p>

<p>I have a few text files which are lists I access regularly. Links for the blog-posts titled, <strong>Links of Note</strong>, Books to read, Recipes to make, YouTube videos to watch, Computer tasks for a later date, etc.. There are about 20 of these lists. I consolidated all of them into one TaskPaper file.</p>

<h2 id="advantages-of-taskpaper">Advantages of TaskPaper</h2>
<ul>
<li>macOS compliant. Two spaces turn into a period and the first letter of a new sentence is capitalized.</li>
<li>Typewriter scrolling. In the theme, you can set where you want the cursor to be.</li>
<li>Fast, stable, well-designed software.</li>
<li>The ability to concentrate on one part of the outline and not the whole thing. Less distraction that way.</li>
<li>Keyboard commands. TaskPaper has those, for everything. Makes using it fun.</li>
<li>Can handle large files without any problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="two-more-features">Two More Features</h2>
<p><strong>Go to anything</strong>. <strong>⌘P</strong>, and you get a dropdown list which lets you go to any project or sub-project in your outline. Fuzzy search window. Fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>Command Palette</strong>. <strong>⇧⌘P</strong>, and you get to a listing of all the commands available to you. Start typing. Choose the command. Hit return. Like Sublime Text and VSCode.</p>

<h2 id="taskpaper-looks-after-my-lists">TaskPaper Looks After My Lists</h2>
<p>TaskPaper is marketed as a program to manage your tasks. It can do that. I am not interested in that part of the product. I use the Reminders app for that. I use TaskPaper as an outlining program and it is fantastic at that.</p>
<p>Why didn’t I use it earlier? I don’t have a good answer for that. Getting distracted by the new shiny is something I seem to be susceptible to. Have to watch out for that impulse and stick to what is working and working well.</p>
<p>An added benefit of sticking to a program? You get to learn the keyboard commands and the muscle memory improves. TaskPaper is going to be handling my lists.</p>
