Apple today updated its <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/">executive leadership page</a> to remove John Giannandrea, who is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/apple-ai-chief-retiring-after-siri-failure/">set to retire</a> from Apple next spring. Earlier this week, Apple said that Giannandrea would step down from his role as AI chief, serving as an advisor until he leaves the company.<br/>

Giannandrea's upcoming retirement was announced on Monday, and Apple wasted no time updating its leadership website. Former Microsoft Corporate VP of AI Amar Subramanya is set to take over as Apple's vice president of AI, but he is not yet listed on the site. Subramanya will report to software engineering chief Craig Federighi.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the teams that Giannandrea led are being shifted to Sabih Khan and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a>, including AI Infrastructure and Search and Knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Giannandrea joined Apple in 2018 as the company's senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy. He was overseeing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, Core ML, and other AI efforts at Apple. Before Apple, Giannandrea worked at Google as a senior vice president of engineering.<br/>
<br/>
After the iOS 18 &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; failure, Giannandrea's retirement comes as no surprise. Apple announced new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features at WWDC when it unveiled iOS 18, and then used those unreleased features to market the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. In spring 2025, when we were expecting the launch of the promised functionality, Apple said the smarter version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; wasn't ready and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">announced a year-long delay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
More than half a dozen former employees who worked on Apple's AI team <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chaos-behind-siri-revealed/">told <em>The Information</em></a> the issues with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; stemmed from poor leadership, stringent privacy practices, conflicting personalities, and indecision. Apple hasn't publicly commented on the situation, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/">stripped Siri</a> from Giannandrea in March and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/siri-management-team-overhaul/">overhauled the Siri team</a>. Apple also removed Giannandrea from its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/apple-robotics-team-leadership-change/">robotics division</a> in April.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/john-giannandrea/">John Giannandrea</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/apple-removes-giannandrea-executive-page/">Apple Removes Former AI Chief John Giannandrea From Executive Leadership Page</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-removes-former-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-from-executive-leadership-page.2474191/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
