<p>Spain’s government plans new rules that would bar children under 16 from using social media. It frames the proposal as part of a broader package to protect minors from harmful online content and hate speech. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called today’s platforms a “digital Wild West” and said children shouldn’t be left to navigate them without stronger safeguards. The proposal lands as European governments tighten oversight of major platforms, and it has already sparked a political clash. Elon Musk, owner of X, criticised Sánchez personally, calling him a “tyrant,” as debate grows over how to balance child safety, free expression, and the practical challenge of verifying ages online.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/IgTS0WLwgEJ7GwQlZnCSvHgrrt-feclGwHJEm6IR9_C3LGpqrfSHFuNxXBGeWj-TY04IpP292zSMg9t17sx8k9MdDWyuwEaslHlbuStvLcEPKJNY31ZeJ4If4OcSKDKKscfSEVlOphFKr2p5UgAi1uuTTyC2M9_khrr5ib4dxOZ0zW1aWaZ5mKOpYbrPTrGrlPE4' alt='A child playing on a phone in Barcelona in 2024.
