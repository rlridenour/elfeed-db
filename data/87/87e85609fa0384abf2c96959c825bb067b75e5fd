<p>I ran into another issue with my System76 desktop &ndash; and this time, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like there&rsquo;s an easy fix. The GPU crushes every now and then, and updating the drivers causes this to happen immediately. If wiping and starting anew doesn&rsquo;t fix it, I&rsquo;m told I&rsquo;ll need to send it for repairs 😖</p>
