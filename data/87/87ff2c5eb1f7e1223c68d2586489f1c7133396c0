Charles Choi has another great addition to his <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual">Casual Suite</a>. This time he helps us with the common problem of <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/announcing-casual-timezone.html">figuring out what time it is in some other place</a>. As Choi says, the Internet makes it common to communicate regularly with people from all over the world. Even the introverts at Irreal find themselves dealing with this.

Choi says that the most common way of dealing with the problem is with a clock app—which typically show times from all over the world—or just looking it up on the Internet. I do the latter. When I want to communicate with someone in, say, London, I simply search for something along the lines of &ldquo;what time is it in London?&rdquo;.

Choi notes that Emacs already has all the machinery to deal with this sort of thing. It just needs to be pulled together into a user accessible package. That&rsquo;s what Casual Timezone does. It provides a myriad of ways to map the time at one place to the time at another.

At this point, the Casual Suite has so many useful apps that it&rsquo;s probably best to simply install the whole suite even if there are some that you don&rsquo;t use. Choi&rsquo;s use of transient menus makes it easy to use them without having to deal with a bunch of bindings that you seldom use and probably won&rsquo;t remember. Take a look at his post for an animation of Casual Timezone in action and see it it&rsquo;s something that might fit your needs.</p>
