<p>Masks have become a hot issue. Here&rsquo;s my 2¢.</p>

</h5>
<p>I think everyone <em>should</em> wear a mask, unless they have a compelling medical reason <em>not</em> to.</p>
<p>Look at it this way: a mask will either help you and those around you, or it will do no harm—beyond a little social awkwardness. If we look at the trade-offs in a game-theory-style matrix, we get:</p>
<p>|                   | Masks Help | Masks don&rsquo;t help |
|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-+&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;+&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;|
| Wear a mask       |       +100 |                0 |
| Don&rsquo;t wear a mask |       -100 |                0 |</p>
<p>There is <em>nothing</em> to loose by wearing a mask, while there is the possibility of loosing a whole lot if we <em>don&rsquo;t</em>. There&rsquo;s some <a href="https://fightcovid19.hku.hk/hku-hamster-research-shows-masks-effective-in-preventing-covid-19-transmission/">preliminary research</a> showing that masks in fact help prevent transmission of COVID-19.</p>
<p>One way to think about wearing a mask is it&rsquo;s like wearing a seat belt: seat belts save lives. Wearing seat belts is mandatory—rightly so!</p>
<p>But masks, unlike seat belts, not only help the wearer, but also protect others. True, cloth masks (home-made; surgical masks and N95 masks do much better of course) don&rsquo;t seem to provide much protection for the <em>wearers</em>, but they do catch some non-negligible portion of the virus coming out of infected people. That one glob of saliva, if it lands right, could be the difference between life-and-death for someone else.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask shows respect and care for those around you. It shows solidarity: hundreds of thousands of people have died across the world—with over 100,000 in the US alone. We need to look out for each other.</p>
<p>Refusing to wear a mask is disrespectful. It&rsquo;s more than just driving without a seat belt. It&rsquo;s like driving drunk: <em>you</em> might be fine, but there are so many other people that you are endangering.</p>
<p>If you continue to not wear a mask just because you feel it restricts your freedom, then I think society is well within its rights to deny you access or services out of self-preservation: the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/woman-seen-licking-ice-cream-viral-video-faces-20-years-n1026556">ice cream licker</a> faces prison time, and drunk drivers can have their licenses suspended.</p>
<p>Finally, think about the <em>disrespect</em> and <em>selfishness</em> you show by not wearing a mask. In essence you are saying, &ldquo;I cannot be bothered to put up with mild discomfort in order to potentially save people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;</p>
