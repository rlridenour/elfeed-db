<p>
Trawling through blogs to add to my feed reader, I
came across a number of posts related to the
<a href="https://artlung.com/blog/2025/03/07/blog-carnival-roundup/">February 2025 IndieWeb Carnival theme of
affirmations</a>. It nudged me to think about the
words I rub into <abbr title="Our kiddo, who's 9 at the moment" tabindex="0">A+'s</abbr> brain with repetition.
</p>

<p>
Once a year or so, A+'s virtual school teachers
typically play a video about affirmations as part
of the social-emotional learning aspect of the
<a href="https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/curriculum/elementary-health-and-physical-education/context/appendices#:~:text=A1.3%20Positive%20Motivation%20and%20Perseverance">curriculum</a>.<sup><a id="fnr.affirmation" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.affirmation" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> The perky narrator exhorts the
listeners to repeat the affirmations after her. A+
doesn't. I don't know if many of the other kids
do.
</p>

<p>
The words I use with A+ are more powerful, so I
want to be thoughtful about them. There's this
idea floating around: the way we talk to our
children becomes their inner
voice.<sup><a id="fnr.attribution" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.attribution" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Here's what I find myself repeating:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>"You worked hard on that."</b> I'm not 100% clear
on the results of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhorn/2023/11/28/controversy-on-whether-growth-mindset-works-will-strengthen-the-theory/">meta-analyses</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset">growth
mindset</a> research, but it makes sense to me to
focus on acknowledging her effort rather than
things that might be considered fixed
characteristics. It's a good contrast to the
"You're so smart!" that she might get from
people impressed by her skills at solving
Rubik's cubes or her enjoyment of math. She
likes it when I see what she's doing, so I also
add specific descriptions, and I extend it with
a long-term perspective. Today she excitedly
told me about how she worked together with a
classmate on their literacy groupwork, so I
echoed that back to her and connected it to her
growth over time. I also often say "You did
that!" and flesh it out with details.</li>

<li><b>"You got this."</b> Because it's important for her
to feel my belief and trust in her, and to enjoy
confidence and self-efficacy. She's been doing
well with increased personal responsibility for
things like homework. Sometimes I say "We got
this" instead, when we're working together.</li>

<li><b>"You know the way."</b> Because it's extra fun
(and extra effective) to sing the things I want
her to remember, and because often she already
knows the next thing she needs to do and this is
a fun way of sending her off. This one is from
the <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/We_Know_the_Way">We Know the Way</a> song from Moana. I like how
I can use snippets of Disney musicals and bring
in all the emotional storytelling connected to
them. I occasionally touch on another line from
that song: "We set a course to find a brand new
island everywhere we roam." She's going to have
to find a brand new way. She can do it. We're
wayfinders.</li>

<li><b>"I got you."</b> Because sometimes she stumbles
and falls, and that's okay. We're here.
Sometimes all she needs is a snuggle. Sometimes she needs a bandage or an energy bar or an emergency frozen treat. Sometimes she needs an extra pair of hands or someone to brainstorm with. We can figure things out together.</li>

<li><b>"You're wonderful."</b> Because it's good for her
to know I'm glad she exists, in a way that
focuses on her wonderfulness rather than my act
of loving her. Along these lines, I also
frequently say, "You're awesome!"</li>

<li><b>"It's your experiment!"</b> Because trying things
out will help her learn, and this reminds me to
back off and let her decide.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Over dinner, I mentioned this list of things I
often say to A+. She wanted me to add these ones:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"I appreciate you, child."</li>
<li>"I love you."</li>
<li>"I'm going to pounce on you." Which is usually
interrupted by her pouncing on me. This amuses
her greatly. I like this playful way to offer a
hug.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is easiest to say these things when we're both
well-rested and in good moods, so part of my job
is to manage myself so that I can be in that state
as often as possible.
</p>

<p>
A+'s beginning to echo these words back to us.
She tells me what she'd like to use her allowance
to experiment with. Yesterday at dinner, she told
me, "You're awesome!" in the same way that I often
tell her. Sometimes, as I send her off on her next
task, she sings, "We know the way."
</p>

<p>
One night, as I was tucking A+ in, she asked for
snuggles. I burrowed under the blankets and said,
"I got you." She said, "You always do."
