First, Apple has updated its website with an image of its relocated <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/shadyside/">Apple Shadyside</a> store in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The store is still located on Walnut Street, just west of Bellefonte Street, in a unit formerly occupied by clothing retailer Gap. Apple gave the unit an all-new brick facade, and it is using the second floor as a Backstage area for employees. The store features a modern design with a combined Genius Bar and Apple Pickup area.<br/>
<br/>
Second, Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/newsroom/2025/08/apple-uniwalk-qianhai-opens-saturday-august-16-in-shenzhen/">previewed</a> its all-new store <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/retail/uniwalkqianhai/">at the Uniwalk Qianhai shopping mall</a> in Shenzhen, China, ahead its grand opening on Saturday, August 16, at 10 a.m. local time. This location features a sweeping curved glass facade, a Genius Bar with varied table and seat heights for accessibility, a dedicated Apple Pickup station, a seating area where customers can try on the Apple Vision Pro, and many other modern design elements.<br/>

Third, <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/retail/denhaag/">Apple Den Haag</a> in the Netherlands reopened today, after being <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/apple-den-haag-temporarily-closing/">temporarily closed since the beginning of June</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/apple-store-den-haag-verbouwing-2025/">reader of the Dutch blog <em>iCulture</em></a>, there are not many customer-facing changes in the store, with some employees there allegedly saying that the updates were primarily focused on internal facilities.<br/>
