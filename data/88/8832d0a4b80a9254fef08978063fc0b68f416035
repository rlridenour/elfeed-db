<p>Latvia&#x27;s parliament voted to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention on preventing violence against women on Thursday, with lawmakers passing the motion by a parliamentary majority . Supporters said the treaty promotes &quot;gender&quot; theories, while opponents and several thousand protesters warned the move would weaken protections for victims; the law had been ratified in November 2024 and the president must now decide the next step . If finalised, the withdrawal would make Latvia the first European Union member to renounce the Council of Europe treaty, and the decision followed a lengthy, heated parliamentary debate .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/3Jm1ctypv5nqqx1J4BQeIH9ESxdhbj5cTd6kgBMPFAsijV8Suwh75PqSLeR8eF_AUsSyedwqCjA8P0HfNmENRvspiurNferXUrjnV43oDFZhagHt4a-CtvhnlAQXJ2G48TXOpLAKC0R_KQJ_-RAS_1Keb7jc0tEGh2awWsKq_Q' alt='Latvian parliament building in Riga after the withdrawal vote' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Treaty background: The Istanbul Convention is a Council of Europe treaty that sets standards to prevent and combat violence against women .</li><li>Parliamentary debate: Lawmakers held a marathon, roughly 13‑hour debate on the motion before the withdrawal vote, signalling deep divisions in parliament .</li><li>Coalition split: A conservative partner in the ruling coalition broke ranks to back withdrawal, acting in defiance of both the prime minister and the president .</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pro-withdrawal lawmakers: Supporters of the move say the treaty promotes &#x27;gender&#x27; theories and therefore conflicts with their positions on gender issues.
