<p class="dcr-130mj7b" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>A tour guide made the discovery at the Old Calton burial ground. It included a drawing of a naked woman pointing a bloodied knife at a baby with a noose around its neck, and coded writing on red electrical tape attached to the David Hume mausoleum and two nearby memorial stones. The guide emailed photographs of the vandalism to Edinburgh council and described the symbols as “satanic”. A group on Telegram purporting to be responsible for the vandalism of graves at unnamed cemeteries posted photographs of the same damage in a now-deleted channel. </em></p>
