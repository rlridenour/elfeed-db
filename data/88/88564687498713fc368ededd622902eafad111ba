<p>A special tribunal in Dhaka on Monday, November 17, 2025, found former prime minister Sheikh Hasina guilty of crimes against humanity for ordering and failing to stop a deadly crackdown on student-led protests in 2024 and sentenced her to death in absentia; former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal was also sentenced to death. The tribunal convicted Hasina on counts including incitement, ordering killings and failure to prevent atrocities during the July–August 2024 uprising that cost many lives, a toll the United Nations has estimated at up to 1,400 people. Hasina has been living in self-exile in India since fleeing Bangladesh on August 5, 2024, and she rejected the verdict as &quot;biased and politically motivated&quot; in a statement issued from abroad.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/6HPUjPkcCQFEbEm6OzFLBWadmtoZ77jd5XICLBaLzUvCl9zr5vfkbaDkK9d6J2O8KPSHzDzjmmZbRI7MB53MP06tB2axWDp0Qb_0k_BAcedhM9wzEBkwrmFOmHZEG09GCrEbrtdh9LVeSoPo1Ddyh9IQGRDg2--h_t_Mpy-5WqjYkptMqLp3mTW9ygztgpW0DWqtNyYoxl2TeLJ_K6X00TOczWHRPH_s' alt='Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s former prime minister, pictured in Dhaka last year.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Exiled leaders: Bangladesh&#x27;s interim government has formally asked India to hand over Hasina and Khan under a 2013 extradition treaty, while New Delhi says it will engage constructively with stakeholders in Dhaka</li><li>Courtroom reaction: When the verdict was read aloud by judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder, people in the packed courtroom cheered and some outside prayed or wept, and the verdict was broadcast live on national television</li><li>International view: The United Nations called the ruling important for victims but said it regretted the imposition of the death penalty and urged respect for due process</li><li>Electoral implications: Observers warn the verdict could heighten tensions ahead of parliamentary elections expected in early February 2026 after the Awami League was barred from contesting recent polls</li></ul><blockquote>The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate, - Sheikh Hasina</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Sheikh Hasina: She rejected the tribunal&#x27;s rulings as &quot;biased and politically motivated&quot; and said the verdicts were issued by a &quot;rigged tribunal&quot;.
