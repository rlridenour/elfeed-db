<p>    Back in 2016, I wrote an Emacs function to <a href="emacs-move-file">move files</a> in Emacs. After my work agreed to sign the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Copyright-Assignment.html">employer disclaimer</a>, I'm able to contribute to Emacs again.</p><p>    So I did.</p><p>    After some discussion, the function was accepted into Emacs. There were a few changes, including renaming it to <code>rename-visited-file</code>.</p><p>    If you build Emacs from source, the function is now in the Emacs git repository. If you don't build from source, it will be available in the next release. If you run Vim, it's not available at all.</p><p>    However it gets used, this has been a great way to <a href="reduce-your-emacs-config">shrink my Emacs config</a>!</p>
