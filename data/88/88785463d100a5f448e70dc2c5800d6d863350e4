When the iMac moved from Intel processors to Apple silicon in 2021, the desktop computer also received a new colorful, ultra-thin design. Since then, the iMac has lacked something that it had for many years: an Apple logo below the screen.<br/>

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Apple did prototype a version of the current iMac with an Apple logo in the "chin" area, according to a post on X today <a href="https://twitter.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1949849046937747857">from a user known as Kosutami</a>. The user has occasionally shared images of alleged Apple device prototypes, but they have also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/airtag-2-in-may-or-june-rumor/">shared some incorrect information</a> in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Apple evidently went with a logo-free iMac screen, but 2021-and-newer models do still have a large Apple logo on the back of the computer.<br/>
<br/>
It would probably be more surprising if Apple had NOT tested both logo and logo-free designs, but if this sort of thing interests you, then now you know.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think Apple made the right choice? Let us know in the comments section.<br/>
