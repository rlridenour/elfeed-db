Older &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ titles including Sofia Coppola's 2020 movie "On the Rocks," Sian Heder's Academy Award-winning 2021 film "CODA," and Aaron Schneider's 2020 World War II drama "Greyhound" are now available to buy or rent in 4K HDR options within the store section of the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app. This differs from Apple's usual distribution model for &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ originals, which generally limits availability to active subscribers and excludes purchase or rental through the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; Store.<br/>
<br/>
Users in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tvPlus/comments/1mo1mh3/in_the_last_two_weeks_apple_has_been_making/">online forums</a> have recently reported seeing the purchase options directly within the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app on Apple devices. <a href="https://www.cheapcharts.com/us/itunes/movies/1806204768">CheapCharts</a>, which tracks iTunes Store pricing and availability, lists the films under their respective iTunes IDs — 1805979868 for On the Rocks, 1806204768 for CODA, and 1805971117 for Greyhound. <br/>

The updated listings in the TV app suggest the company is testing or rolling out a new hybrid distribution model for its in-house productions. This could allow non-subscribers to access specific older titles without committing to the &#36;9.99 per month &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ subscription.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/older-apple-tv-movies-available-to-purchase/">Older Apple TV+ Movies Available to Purchase Directly</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/older-apple-tv-movies-available-to-purchase-directly.2463230/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
