<p>This poem is <a href="https://www.congress.gov/93/crecb/1974/07/11/GPO-CRECB-1974-pt17-6-1.pdf#page=117">widely purported</a> to have been written by a 15-year-old boy two years before he ended his life:</p>
<p>Once on a yellow paper with green lines<br />
he wrote a poem<br />
and he called it &#8220;chops&#8221; because that<br />
was the name of his dog<br />
and that&#8217;s what it was all about<br />
and his teacher gave him an &#8220;A&#8221; and<br />
a gold star<br />
and his mother hung it on the kitchen door<br />
and read it to all his aunties<br />
that was the year father tracy took<br />
all the kids to the zoo and let them<br />
sing on the bus<br />
and that was the year his baby sister<br />
was born with tiny toenails and no hair<br />
and his mother and father kissed a lot<br />
and the girl around the corner sent<br />
him a valentine signed with a row of x&#8217;s<br />
and his father always tucked him<br />
in bed at night<br />
and was always there to do it.</p>
<p>Once on a white paper with green lines<br />
he wrote a poem<br />
and he called it &#8220;autumn&#8221; because<br />
that was the name of the season<br />
and that&#8217;s what it was all about<br />
and his teacher gave him an &#8220;A&#8221; and<br />
told him to write more clearly<br />
and his mother never hung it on<br />
the kitchen door because it had just<br />
been painted<br />
and the other kids told him that<br />
father tracy smoked cigars and left<br />
the butts in the pews<br />
and that was the year his sister got glasses<br />
with thick lenses and black frames<br />
and the girl around the corner laughed<br />
at him when he went to see Santa Claus<br />
at Macy&#8217;s<br />
and the kids told him why his<br />
mother and father kissed a lot<br />
and his father never tucked him in<br />
bed at night and he got mad when<br />
he got mad and cried for him to do it.</p>
<p>Once on a paper torn from his notebook<br />
he wrote a poem<br />
and he called it &#8220;question marked<br />
innocense&#8221; because that was the name<br />
of his girl<br />
and his professor gave him an &#8220;A&#8221; and<br />
a strange and steady look<br />
and his mother never hung it on<br />
the kitchen door because he never<br />
showed it to her<br />
that was the year father tracy died<br />
and he forgot how the end of the<br />
&#8220;apostles creed&#8221; went<br />
and he caught his sister necking on<br />
the back porch<br />
and his mother and father never<br />
kissed anymore or even talked<br />
and the girl around the corner<br />
wore too much makeup and made<br />
him cough when he kissed her, but he<br />
kissed her anyway<br />
and at 3 a.m. he tucked himself in bed,<br />
his father snoring soundly.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why on the back of a pack of<br />
matches he wrote another poem<br />
and he called it &#8220;absolutely nothing&#8221;<br />
because that&#8217;s what it was about<br />
and he gave himself an &#8220;A&#8221;<br />
and a slash on each damp wrist<br />
and he hung it on the bathroom door<br />
because he couldn&#8217;t reach the kitchen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/details/abbotcourant982abbo/page/76/mode/2up">earliest publication</a> I can find attributes it to a Cathy Curtis, a 12-year-old student at the Abbot Academy, a girls&#8217; boarding school in Andover, Mass., whose literary magazine published the poem in June 1971. The school closed the following year. I haven&#8217;t been able to learn anything more about Curtis.</p>
<p>10/07/2025 UPDATE: Intrepid reader Adam Mellion has made a much, much deeper research effort than I did and found that the author appears to be Earl Reum (1931-2010), a teacher and motivational speaker who worked in the Denver, Colo., school system in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Adam&#8217;s sources include a blog post by Genel Hodges, executive director of the National Association of Workshop Directors, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140716131210/http://reumors.typepad.com/reumors/2012/10/poem-from-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower.html">who knew Reum</a>, and the transcript of an interview with Stephen Chbosky, author of <em>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</em> and director of the film of the same name, in both of which the poem appears, and who managed to speak with Reum. Separately, writer Donald Gallo recounts his own effort to identify the poet in the article &#8220;A Different Kind Of Whodunit: The Search for a Poem&#8217;s Author,&#8221; which appeared in the April 2000 issue of <em>Voice of Youth Advocates</em>. He too concluded that Reum is the author:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Earl Reum says he wrote the first version in 1954 shortly after a student with whom he was very close attempted suicide during Reum&#8217;s first month of teaching at Merrill Junior High School in Denver, Colorado. &#8216;I was devastated,&#8217; Reum says. &#8216;I never truly recovered from the experience.&#8217;</p>
<p>At that time, the Student Activities Office of the Denver Public Schools produced a series of booklets containing what Reum calls &#8216;Teacher-Advisor Stuff&#8217; &#8212; without titles and without author credit. As a student council advisor, Reum submitted his poem. The &#8216;A PERSON/A PAPER/A PROMISE&#8217; title was added when Reum became the Activities Coordinator for the Denver Schools in 1960, and approximately two thousand copies of those booklets were sent to activities directors throughout the nation, thus accounting for the poem&#8217;s widespread distribution.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Gallo adds, &#8220;The poem, Reum says, &#8216;has changed and changed &#8230; grown and gotten used, augmented and has had parts deleted.&#8217; But he says this with joy rather than regret. He has never been bothered by the changes nor by other people claiming authorship. &#8216;The ultimate compliment,&#8217; he says, &#8216;is when people take your stuff and sign their names. It makes the world a bit smaller and more intimate.'&#8221;</p>
<p>A million thanks to Adam for sorting all this out &#8212; there are now so many conflicting attributions, and so many versions of the poem, that it&#8217;s very hard to determine its origins. This seems pretty conclusive.</p>
