<p>Ukraine says it is working to resume prisoner exchanges with Russia that could free about 1,200 Ukrainians, a development President Volodymyr Zelenskyy highlighted as talks and calls continue to push the process forward. Kiev’s national security chief, Rustem Umerov, has reported progress in negotiations and said he has held meetings related to the talks, underlining active diplomacy behind the scenes. The move comes amid continued fighting on the front lines and follows a history of sporadic swaps between the two countries that have previously returned thousands of detainees.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/W2nNuqOlX9yOTh_rbYJQVoIWWtw5TekxWjBobHFMydQ06nzSPq5tCt2B0Aj6EYU4VgPShp3vbMmki1wjv1IKZl5_QTj6QSskJR7raXeaMgumFkY7euIfJF4IdzpQhb7ZRmC-z_ZF-edC0f1G8XifIXbX1QR2zGPFF5FmpOsWxPWpQ-oAnR0VAlLn-s5Jj5eyvHg92G31AbvRng' alt='Zelenskyy says Ukraine is working on prisoner exchange with Russia' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Negotiation steps: Ukraine’s national security chief reported concrete progress and said he held meetings and calls to advance negotiations.</li><li>Security context: Ukraine’s armed forces reported that Russia launched roughly 1,200 attacks across Ukraine in the past week, underscoring fighting continuing alongside talks.</li><li>Past exchanges: Previous Russia–Ukraine prisoner swaps have been intermittent but have at times returned thousands of people, showing exchanges can be large-scale when they occur.</li></ul><blockquote>We are … counting on the resumption of POW exchanges, - Volodymyr Zelenskyy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Volodymyr Zelenskyy (Ukraine president): Ukraine is working to resume prisoner exchanges that could free 1,200 Ukrainians, and leaders are conducting meetings, negotiations and calls to secure this result.
