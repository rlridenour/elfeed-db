Steam will stop supporting macOS 11 Big Sur on October 15, 2025, <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/659D-A19E-018A-81A6">according to Valve</a>, requiring Mac users to upgrade to macOS Monterey or later to continue accessing the gaming platform.<br/>

The reason Steam will soon stop working on Big Sur is due to the client's reliance on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older macOS versions. Future Steam updates will also require security features only available in macOS 12 and above.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also discontinued security updates for Big Sur in 2023, and that's left legacy systems vulnerable to malware that could compromise Steam accounts and game performance. Valve is strongly recommending affected Mac users upgrade before the October deadline.<br/>
<br/>
The announcement comes amid Steam's transition to a native Apple silicon client following Apple's stated plan to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-to-phase-out-rosetta-2/">phase out Rosetta 2</a>. Valve released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/steam-beta-adds-native-apple-silicon-support/">first native beta</a> shortly after WWDC in June, signalling its dedication to continue to support Mac gaming. Testers have generally reported dramatically faster launch times and smoother navigation through the Store and Library.<br/>
<br/>
Not that if you're still running Big Sur, you won't be able to launch Steam or any purchased games after the cutoff date. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/steam/">Steam</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/steam-client-requires-macos-12-october-15/">Steam Client to Require macOS 12+ Starting October 15</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/steam-client-to-require-macos-12-starting-october-15.2462858/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
