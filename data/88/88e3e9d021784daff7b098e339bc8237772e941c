<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip — the same chip
found in the iPhone 17 lineup, iPhone Air, Apple Watch Ultra 3,
and Apple Watch Series 11 — powers the new AirTag, making it
easier to locate than ever before. Using haptic, visual, and audio
feedback, Precision Finding guides users to their lost items from
up to 50 percent farther away than the previous generation. And an
upgraded Bluetooth chip expands the range at which items can be
located. For the first time, users can use Precision Finding on
Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, to
find their AirTag, bringing a powerful experience to the wrist.</p>

<p>Solid update to the original AirTags, which <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-introduces-airtag/">debuted five years ago</a>. Better range, louder speaker, increased precision. The form factor remains unchanged, so second-gen AirTags will fit in keychains or holders designed for the first-gen model. They even take the same batteries. Pricing also remains unchanged: $29 for one, $99 for a four-pack.</p>
