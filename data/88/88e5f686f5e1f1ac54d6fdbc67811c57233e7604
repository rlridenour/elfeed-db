<p id="p2">Every year, the Unicode Consortium announces new emoji that will be added in the fall and incorporated in iOS and other OSes in the months that follow. The latest batch that were <a href="https://blog.unicode.org/2025/07/say-hello-to-new-emoji-coming-in.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced today</a> to coincide with World Emoji Day will be part of Unicode 17 and include:</p>
<ul id="ul3"><li>Trombone</li>
<li>Treasure Chest</li>
<li>Distorted Face</li>
<li>Apple Core</li>
<li>Fight Cloud</li>
<li>Ballet Dancers&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hairy Creature&nbsp;</li>
<li>Orca</li>
</ul><p id="p4">As usual, it&rsquo;s an eclectic mix that rounds out certain categories and includes other emoji that are just plain fun. I look forward to Federico trying to guess these on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connected</a>. There&rsquo;s an almost one-to-one overlap between the ones I know I&rsquo;ll use the most and those that I think Federico will never guess.</p>
