<p>The cancellation of <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>—CBS insists it was purely a “financial decision,” the result of declining ad revenue in late night television. While <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPegVZ9CU4A">some buy this argument</a>, others<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/arts/television/stephen-colbert-late-show-canceled-why.html?unlocked_article_code=1.YU8.UT0r.hblx7j8Pe1Hn&amp;smid=url-share"> see it</a> as a different kind of “financial decision,” a decision by Paramount (the parent company of CBS) to sacrifice Colbert so that the American president won’t cancel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_merger_of_Skydance_Media_and_Paramount_Global">a lucrative $28-billion merger</a>. Yesterday, David Letterman, the previous host of CBS’ <em>The Late Show</em>, released a 20-minute supercut featuring the many times he took CBS to task over the years. The subtext? He doesn’t seem to buy CBS’s talking points.&nbsp;Nor does Jon Stewart. More direct than Letterman, Stewart gives his own take on why CBS canceled Colbert: “I think the answer is in the fear and pre-compliance that is gripping all of America’s institutions at this very moment, institutions that have chosen not to fight the vengeful and vindictive actions of our <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796?st=JKedKQ&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">pubic-hair-doodling commander-in-chief</a>. This is not the moment to give in. I’m not giving in. I’m not going anywhere.” Note to reader: Jon Stewart’s <em>The</em> <em>Daily Show</em> airs on Comedy Central, which is owned by Paramount.</p>
