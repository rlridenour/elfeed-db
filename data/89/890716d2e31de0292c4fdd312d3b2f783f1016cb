Intro 🖼1
There are several copy-pasted articles2 out there on setting up project-local postgres instances. Which one came first or whether they are both copies of another, I don&rsquo;t know; but in any case, I found the goals good, and was enlightened by the concept. There are several technical errors, but they served to get the juices flowing.
I am using the Postgres software version I got from GUIX, which is postgres 14.
