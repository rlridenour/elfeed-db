<p>I came across some of my very first plain text files recently while looking for something else.</p>
<p>What an awwwwww moment!</p>
<p>It was like seeing early photos of your offspring by chance and realising just how much they have grown. My text-babies were born around 2014 and they are so cute in their level-1 simplicity! I love how supremely readable they are, despite the rookie errors. (I was an old-school graphic designer with no non-GUI experience, and had just briefly heard about Markdown)</p>

<p>The sweet and simple look of the raw Markdown in those files has inspired me to make changes to to the look of the files I’m using today. I’ve switched to a monospaced font for both reading and edit views, and removed the colour and size variations for different header levels via the Minimal Theme Settings and Style Settings plugins.</p>

<p>Cute as all that colour and font detail was, I was starting to find each one the equivalent of a tap on the shoulder. Or the eyeballs. It’s no exaggeration to say that my brain could come up with something to be distracted by in a silent, empty room with no windows! I appreciate all the help I can get to stay on task.</p>
<p>If you can relate to this but like me you still crave variety, try cycling through a couple of sets of fairly plain options. Your aim is to get a subtle new look without opening up Pandora’s Box of Tweaking Temptations.</p>
<p>The following four variations of the same text illustrate the point. Each pings different parts of my brain, and I’m grateful it is quick and easy to switch between them without leaving the comfortable boundary of plain text files.</p>

<p>(Did your eagle eye pick up that there are two <em>betweens</em> in each text sample? Mine didn’t, until I’d finished writing this and noticed the blue underline in the TextEdit version. I also noticed that I’d neglected to add blank line paragraph spaces, but that didn’t show up in any but the TextEdit version)</p>
<h3 id="defining-the-scope-of-your-files">Defining the scope of your files</h3>
<p>Where are the boundaries of your files and your workflow? Are you just as clear on what doesn’t belong, as on what does?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/07251e6e-a5bb-4366-90df-7bdc5d33f947/ptpl-189-calendar-txt.png" alt="a block of text in calendar.txt format" width="1704" height="1384"></p>
<p>When I started the calendar.txt tiny experiment, the file was, as per the protocol, a wall of text. As time went on I began including journal-type entries along with the events, but that quickly got out of hand—even with syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>I had to define what the file was actually <em>for</em>, and make decisions on what did not belong there. In the case of the plain text calendar, a format shakeup was also needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/3593ce57-1e7c-49b8-a56e-be190f0416e8/pasted-percent20image-percent2020260105090851.png" alt="screenshot of Obsidian window showing an outline in the right sidebar and text under date headings in the main section. The outline shows year, month, week, and daily headers in descending levels" width="2440" height="1596"></p>
<p><a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/09/29/ptpl-175-calendar-txt-simplest-time-planning-system" title="wikilink">Calendar.txt</a> is now planner.md, and has a Markdown header hierarchy and blank lines between each section. The previous version was a cool idea and it worked, to an extent, but I came to see that that kind of rigidity wasn’t serving me.</p>
<p>The blank lines in my planner file now provide visual differentiation between sections when scrolling through the days, without distracting my brain the way sizes and colours used to.</p>
<p>(I love how easy Obsidian makes this kind of shakeup! Using the Style Settings plugin I can change things up very quickly. And that plugin allows downloading settings so you can save and reload old sets at will.)</p>
<p>Principle: Define the scope of your document. What does it need to do? What are you choosing <em>not</em> to have the document do? For example:</p>
<p><strong><span class="small-caps">IN</span> <span class="small-caps">SCOPE</span></strong><br>
My planner file must show me what I have committed to do on specific dates in the future, and allow space for time blocking and non-negotiable tasks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="small-caps">OUT</span> <span class="small-caps">OF</span> <span class="small-caps">SCOPE</span></strong><br>
Someday or maybes do not belong here. If a task or event is in my planner, it happens! — Or it gets rescheduled. No transclusions, no embedded search queries!</p>
<p>I hope that the planner file case study helps to illustrate that the thinking behind a workflow matters more than the tool or system being used. And that is something which can be applied to any need, style, or taste.</p>
<h3 id="take-aways">Take aways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Define your scope and stick with it; modify as needed</li>
<li>Be aware of the things that distract you and reduce them by adjusting the way you use your tools</li>
<li>Things that are unnecessary but which make you smile are okay too but make sure your system works without them</li>
<li>Be intentional with everything you layer onto and around the basics</li>
</ul>
