<p>Elon Musk, in a tweet responding to Google’s announcement of their deal to provide Gemini to Apple for use in Apple Intelligence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google,
given that the also have Android and Chrome</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure that if Grok were as popular as Gemini, Musk would turn down a deal with Apple to avoid concentrating “power” in his hands.</p>
