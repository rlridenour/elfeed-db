<li>They can play audio in stereo! (On Android devices)</li>
<li>They can also provide stereo light!</li>
<li>(That’s light from two different angles)</li>
<li>Are these Mac compatible: We usually do a joke here, but for this one, we’re gonna keep it simple; NO, THEY ARE NOT</li>
</ul><h1>Look & Listen</h1><p>What do we have here? A couple work lights that are also bluetooth speakers. So, they can provide a little illumination and play a little music in stereo. (<strong>If you have an Android device</strong>.)</p>
<p>In other words, they’re the perfect thing to buy now so you have them on hand for those long, dark days of November through March, when you’ll be toiling away in the basement at whatever indoor hobby you’ve assigned yourself this winter.</p>
<p>Now the only thing you need to do is decide what that hobby is.</p>
<p>If you’re lost, we have a few recommendations:</p>
<p><strong>Cake Sculpting</strong></p>
<p>We know what you’re thinking. Isn’t this a hobby for the kitchen? Well, yes. Part of it is. But the great thing about cake sculpting, as we’ve learned from watching a bunch of really stupid shows about it, is that the cake doesn’t have to taste good! In fact, if you’re going to do an elaborate cake sculpture like they do on, say, <em>Buddy Vs. Duff</em> or <em>Halloween Wars</em>, you probably want the cake to be dense as hell for stability. So bake a few terrible, dense cakes, bring them down to the basement, and get to work chiseling them into something ridiculous under the glow of (and with the soundtrack provided by) your sick new work lights!</p>
<p><strong>Playing God</strong></p>
<p>There’s not one but two Frankenstein movies on the way. But why spend a couple hours watching a film about a man sewing together a monster and bringing it to life when you can, instead, do all that sewing and bringing to life yourself? After all, we haven’t read <em>Frankenstein</em> in a while, but we’re pretty sure that the lesson is: science is rad, and we should definitely use it to reanimate corpses. So, flip on your lights, start listening to <em>Monster Mash</em> on repeat, and get to work on your own vile, depressive creature!</p>
<p><strong>Making Lists Of Possible Hobbies For Next Winter</strong></p>
<p>Hobbies. They can be so cool. But, also, discouraging. So why <em>have</em> a hobby when you can <em>think</em> about as many hobbies as you want? What we’re saying is: turn on the lights, stream a motivational podcast, and start listing out all the great things you’ll do <em>next</em> winter. It’s a perfect hobby because it’s impossible to fail at! Just remember to add “list hobbies for the winter after next” among the potential hobbies. That way, you’ll have an out for next year too!</p>
<p>Okay, fine. These are not good hobbies. So, let us know about your actual winter hobby in the comments. Or just buy some light/speaker things. That’s fine too. But remember: these work with <strong>Android devices only</strong>.</p>
