If you have an Hermès Apple Watch model, you're going to want to avoid installing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a> beta 2.<br/>

According to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchos-release-notes/watchos-26-release-notes">Apple's release notes</a> for the update, the beta causes the Apple Watch Hermès to crash continually. Apple says that Hermès Apple Watch owners should not update to beta 2 at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Installing &zwnj;watchOS 26&zwnj; on a Hermès Apple Watch causes the watch to overheat, crash continually, and fail to charge, based on reports. It appears to be the Hermès Apple Watch face that is an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, reports from <em>MacRumors</em> readers suggest that updating to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta 2 causes problems with the Hermès Apple Watches. Users have found that the Apple Watch app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> will not open after installing &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; beta 2 if there is a Hermès watch associated with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Unpairing a Hermès Apple Watch from an &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; beta 2 device allows the Apple Watch app to open again, but attempting to re-pair the watch does not work.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will likely address the issue in the next &zwnj;watchOS 26&zwnj; and &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; updates, but for now, if you have a Hermès Apple Watch and have not installed the latest developer betas, make sure not to do so.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/25/watchos-26-hermes-crash-issue/">Warning: watchOS 26 Beta 2 Crashes Apple&#039;s Expensive Hermès Watches</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/warning-watchos-26-beta-2-crashes-apples-expensive-hermès-watches.2459688/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
