The future of <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/">Apple Fitness+</a> remains "under review," according to the latest word <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk">from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. However, he did not share any specific details.<br/>

"If I were to guess, Apple will ultimately meld its Health app with Fitness+ in some fashion — perhaps offering it as a combined subscription," said Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman recently reported that Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/apple-reportedly-scales-back-ios-27-feature/">scaled back plans for a separate Apple Health+ subscription service</a>, which would have provided AI-powered health recommendations. However, he said some of the features that would have been part of Apple Health+ will be repurposed and rolled out individually.<br/>
<br/>
Launched in 2020, Apple Fitness+ offers a library of trainer-led workout and meditation videos in Apple's Fitness app, across the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. In the U.S., the service costs &#36;9.99 per month or &#36;79.99 per year. Apple Fitness+ is also included in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/">Apple One Premier</a> bundle for &#36;37.95 per month.<br/>
