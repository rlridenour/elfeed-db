<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> adds new functionality to the AirPods, which will be available this fall when Apple releases &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and new AirPods firmware to the public.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="camera_remote">Camera Remote</h2><br/>
The AirPods can be used as a camera remote for the Camera app or third-party iOS camera apps. Just connect your AirPods to your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, open the Camera app, and then press and hold on the AirPods stem to take a photo or start a video recording.<br/>
<br/>
When you're finished, a second press and hold gesture will stop the recording. If you have an Apple Watch, you can already control your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; remotely from your wrist, but the AirPods have the potential to be even quicker since it's a physical gesture rather than a series of steps that include opening an Apple Watch app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="studio-quality_recording">Studio-Quality Recording</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 support recording studio-quality audio for interviews, podcasts, songs, videos, and more. Apple says that the feature can be used to record high-quality vocals while on the go, with background sounds filtered out thanks to Voice Isolation.<br/>
<br/>
You can record higher-quality audio when making videos or using your devices to do things like record a podcast.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="improved_audio_quality">Improved Audio Quality</h2><br/>
The H2 chip in the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; and &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 brings more natural vocal texture and clarity to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; calls, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls, and all CallKit-enabled apps like Zoom.<br/>
<br/>
Studio-quality audio recording and improved call quality are available across &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac, and support the Camera app, Voice Memos, Messages dictation, third-party camera apps, and video conferencing apps.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="beta_updates">Beta Updates</h2><br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, Apple is adding an option to more easily install beta updates on AirPods. There's a new update interface when you connect your AirPods to your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and tap into them in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="pause_audio_for_sleep">Pause Audio for Sleep</h2><br/>
If you're listening to music, a podcast, or a book while you're in bed and you're wearing AirPods, the AirPods will pause your audio when you fall asleep if you toggle on the new "Pause Media When Falling Asleep" option.<br/>
<br/>
You'll find it in the AirPods settings after connecting your AirPods to your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but you'll need the new AirPods firmware and &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. In addition to saving your spot in an audiobook or podcast, it will also preserve battery by turning your AirPods off so they're not running all night.<br/>
<br/>
This feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/01/beats-airpods-sleep-pause-ios-26/">also works with Beats earbuds</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="keep_audio_in_headphones">Keep Audio in Headphones</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; addresses an irritating issue that happens with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> and AirPods. There's a new "Keep Audio in Headphones" option that prevents audio from switching to car speakers or Bluetooth speakers when you're listening to music through the AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
With the option on, your music will continue playing in your AirPods when you get in the car. You can turn it on in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; by going to Settings > General > <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> and Continuity.<br/>
