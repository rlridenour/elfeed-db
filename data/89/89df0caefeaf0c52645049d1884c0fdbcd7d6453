I just came across a link to this recently updated book <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1jo7yqd/use_gnu_emacs_the_plain_text_computing_environment/">on the plain text computing environment</a>. It was, apparently, first written to describe Emacs 19.29 around 1997. That was a long time ago and Emacs has evolved considerably since then. Happily, the book has recently been updated to Emacs 29.4. It&rsquo;s over 600 pages so there&rsquo;s a lot of content.

You can see the book <a href="https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/emacs/">here</a>, There&rsquo;s an interactive menu on the left that will give you an idea of what&rsquo;s available. Besides HTML, it&rsquo;s available in PDF and various EPUB formats. At more than 600 pages there&rsquo;s obviously lot of content but the author, Keith Waclena, says that while you <i>could</i> read it straight through, he doubts many people will. Rather, it&rsquo;s designed to enable you to skip to any topic you&rsquo;re interested in.

Obviously, I haven&rsquo;t been through the book in detail—having just discovered it—but it seems like a useful resource, especially for users new to Emacs. Take a look, especially if your a n00b.</p>
