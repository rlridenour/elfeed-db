<p>I think I&rsquo;m going back to clocking in and out of sub-tasks, even though <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/11/14/handling-project-in-emacs-the.html">I said I wouldn&rsquo;t</a>. It&rsquo;s easier not to, but the end result, I think, is messier, and I can&rsquo;t get the clock reports right&hellip; on the other hand, it&rsquo;s kind of an overkill. 🤔</p>
