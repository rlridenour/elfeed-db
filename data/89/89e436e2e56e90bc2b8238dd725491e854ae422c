<p>White <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/03/22/stephen-white-1983-2021/">died in 2021</a> at the age of 38.</p>
<p>The White Prize will be awarded biennially &#8220;to the best published paper by a junior philosopher that engages directly with Professor White’s work or with themes that were central to his thinking,&#8221; says the APA. Those themes include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em>Issues of moral responsibility, in particular what we should take responsibility for and to</em><br />
<em>what extent we are especially responsible for our own lives;</em></li>
<li><em>Issues of practical reasoning, in particular whether and how predictions about how we or</em><br />
<em>others are likely to act should figure in our thinking about what to do;</em></li>
<li><em>Issues about shared reasoning and mutual answerability;</em></li>
<li><em>The relation between a group’s obligations (e.g., our collective obligation to address and</em><br />
<em>mitigate climate change) and the individual obligations of the group’s members.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The prize winner will receive $1,000 (if there are co-winners, they will split the prize amount equally).</p>
<p>Submissions are open now through July 15th for the inaugural White Prize.
