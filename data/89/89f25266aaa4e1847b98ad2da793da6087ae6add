<p>If your web site isn&rsquo;t receiving the notifications from Ebay even though you have everything configured AND <strong>you&rsquo;re using oAuth tokens</strong> for <code>SetNotificationsPreferences</code> request then you have nothing to do except contact the Ebay support.</p>
<p>Currently they have a special <strong>whitelist</strong> where they have to add your <code>APP ID</code> and the only way to add your app to that <strong>whitelist</strong> is to contact them.
You can actually try to post a thread on their forum, but in this case you have to wait while someone form ebay staff will notice it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Support costs money and the price is <strong>$75/hour</strong>. Good news is they are not billing you for the request to whitelist your app so you can spend that hour for something else.</p>
