        <p><time datetime="2025-01-02" title="2025-01-02">The other night</time> I dreamt of traveling to a book store in a small town south of
where I lived.  The building stood on a corner, with a wood pane window.
Entering the bookshop, I ascended three steps.</p>
<p>The room with warm wood built-in shelves welcomed me in, displaying a myriad of
books, mostly front-facing.  Soft light radiating from amidst the shelves.  It
felt comfortable and familiar.  I had been there before during my waking hours.
This I knew.</p>
<p>And I knew the roads that I’d taken to get there.  These were recent enough
memories, though I don’t know from when; but then again what has time become
since the days of COVID?</p>
<p>I remember the drive not from the dream, but from that first and second time I
had been there; a turn and bank of a highway, one road heading east and another
dipping south, splitting off to the small town where I’d find this bookstore.</p>
<p>There was the fields running along the state highway that I drove; one of those
that invariably has the moniker “Old State Road” as though the department of
transportation could not truly bury a road of yesteryear.</p>
<p>Driving into the small town, with only three ways in, the store sat at what
would be top left arm of a T-intersection.  It was not a T of the perpendicular
angled type, but instead a T as though it were an umbrella blown out by the
wind.  This road was the major intersection of the small town.</p>
<p>This street corner a convex lens into something deep within me.  What does it
mean to have known so truly that I have been there both in a dream and in a
memory of a waking day that I came to realize was itself a dream?</p>
<p>I have been there—my soul at least.  Not seeking any book in particular, but
instead for a chance to commune with dead voices of those that have bled upon
the page.</p>
<p>And as I write this <time datetime="2025-05-16" title="2025-05-16">several months since that dream</time>, I think of that road and
those steps.  And of other recurring dreams I’ve had regarding libraries and
bookstores.  What does my soul seek?  Connection?  To ancestors?  To memories?
To understand?</p>
<p>I hope I may again travel that road and ascend those stairs; and if not those
then some other place that Borges too has visited.</p>
