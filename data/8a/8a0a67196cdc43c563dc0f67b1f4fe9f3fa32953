<p>Syria’s Defence Ministry announced an early-Friday ceasefire covering three northern Aleppo neighbourhoods after several days of clashes between government forces and Kurdish-led fighters. The fighting, described as the worst violence since Islamist authorities took power last year, killed at least 21 people and forced large-scale displacement from the city. The truce also included a limited window for armed groups to leave the contested areas, in a bid to prevent further fighting inside residential districts.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/bF0jY6epgngqOwpIk8dfEZhRuYOrIGR6or7IV7mF0cHQXqWR_1yEchHYmCb8asAr2aCyVeXfmxf5NDD8L9VoM1UnUxm71ZjvJyPgVWxeOYIy' alt='Members of the Syrian Civil Defence work to extinguish a fire after shelling amid renewed clashes between the Syrian army and the Syrian Democratic Forces in Aleppo, Syria, January 8, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Evacuation measures: Syrian authorities published maps of areas they said would be targeted and imposed a curfew in Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh, while also opening an evacuation corridor for civilians to leave contested districts.</li><li>Scale of flight: Reporting on the ground described widespread displacement from Aleppo, with one estimate putting the number of people driven from their homes at more than 140,000 during the latest fighting.</li><li>Mediation efforts: Reuters reporting cited by multiple outlets said the United States was spearheading efforts to reach a ceasefire between Damascus and the SDF.</li><li>Deal still stuck: Several outlets linked the clashes to stalled implementation of an agreement meant to merge SDF-linked civil and military structures into the central government by the end of 2025.</li><li>Earlier autonomy: RT said Damascus and Kurdish leaders struck an Aleppo deal in April granting autonomy under Damascus’ rule, but said a broader reintegration agreement was never implemented, with both sides blaming the other.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Syrian Defence Ministry: It said it ordered a ceasefire around Sheikh Maqsoud, Ashrafiyeh and Bani Zeid to prevent further escalation in residential areas, and framed the step as enabling displaced civilians to return to normal life in security and stability.
