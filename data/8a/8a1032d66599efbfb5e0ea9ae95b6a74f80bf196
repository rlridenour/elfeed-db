The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> is one of Europe's top-selling smartphones, yet its early sales figures still lagged significantly behind those of Apple's previous mid-tier models, according to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/iphone-16e-enters-europes-top-10-in-first-month/">Counterpoint Research</a>.<br/>

&zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; launched in February, marking the company's first attempt in recent years to redefine its mid-range offerings with a product distinct from its "SE" branding. Despite debuting on Europe's Top 10 smartphones list in its first full month of availability, the model failed to match the initial traction of its predecessors. <br/>
<br/>
Counterpoint Research finds that the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; was the ninth best-selling smartphone in Europe in March, representing 8% of Apple's total <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales in the region and 2% of the broader smartphone market. In Western Europe, the device performed slightly better, securing the seventh position overall.<br/>
<br/>
However, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;'s early performance marks a clear departure from the success of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE models that preceded it. The third-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE from 2022 ranked sixth on the same European bestseller list during its first month and accounted for 12% of Apple's regional &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE from 2020 performed even more strongly, achieving third place overall and making up 19% of Apple's European &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales in its debut month. Compared to these benchmarks, &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; sales were down 17% versus the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2022) and down 20% compared to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2020), according to Counterpoint.<br/>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, the primary reason identified for the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;'s weaker debut is its higher launch price. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; generally starts at €699 in Europe. This is a significant increase over the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2022), which debuted at €519, and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE (2020), which launched at €479. <br/>

Additionally, the mid-tier smartphone market in Europe is increasingly price-sensitive; consumers are showing increased interest in refurbished and second-hand iPhones, which further complicates Apple's efforts to drive volume through new mid-range hardware. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/">Counterpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-16e-sales-lag-behind-se-models/">iPhone 16e Sales Lag Behind SE Models Despite Bestseller Status</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-sales-lag-behind-se-models-despite-bestseller-status.2458137/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
