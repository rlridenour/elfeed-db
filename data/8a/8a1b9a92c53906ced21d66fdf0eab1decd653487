The battery capacity of Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air will be below the 3,000 mAh mark, according to a <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PBxtDhfSw">recent post</a> from Instant Digital, an account with more than 1.4 million followers on Chinese social media platform Weibo.<br/>

Thanks to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/21/ios-26-adaptive-power-mode-compatible-iphones/">iOS 26's new Adaptive Power Mode</a>, though, the account said that the iPhone 17 Air should achieve full-day battery life.<br/>
<br/>
A previous rumor pegged the iPhone 17 Air's battery capacity <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/iphone-17-air-battery-capacity-revealed/">at around 2,800 mAh</a>, which would indeed be below the 3,000 mAh mark.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models were the last with battery capacities at or below the 3,000 mAh mark. Of course, you can only directly compare mAh values when the batteries have the same voltage, with Wh a preferred unit of measurement. iPhone batteries typically do have the same voltage, allowing for mAh comparisons.<br/>

Instant Digital has accurately leaked Apple information before, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">Yellow finish for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-introduce-redesigned-milanese-loop/">Apple Watch Ultra 2's Titanium Milanese Loop</a>. However, the account does not have a perfect track record.<br/>

A few months ago, <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma reported that the iPhone 17 Air would have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">"worse" battery life</a> compared to previous iPhone models, due to the device's rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">ultra-thin 5.5mm design</a> limiting internal space for a battery.<br/>
<br/>
In internal testing, Apple determined that the percentage of users who will be able to use the iPhone 17 Air for a full day without needing to recharge the device throughout the day will be between 60% and 70%, according to that report. For other iPhone models, the report said that metric is apparently between 80% and 90%.<br/>
<br/>
To mitigate this problem, the report said that Apple is planning to release a battery case as an optional accessory for the iPhone 17 Air.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last released battery cases <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/20/apple-new-iphone-11-battery-cases/">for the iPhone 11 lineup</a>, followed by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">since-discontinued MagSafe Battery Pack</a> for iPhone 12 models and newer. A battery case both protects an iPhone and provides additional battery life as necessary.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/18/iphone-17-air-battery-capacity-rumor/">iPhone 17 Air&#039;s Limited Battery Capacity Leaked</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-airs-limited-battery-capacity-leaked.2461789/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
