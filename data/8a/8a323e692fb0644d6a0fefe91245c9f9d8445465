<p>Pakistani and Afghan Taliban forces exchanged heavy fire overnight along their shared border, hitting areas around major crossings such as Spin Boldak–Chaman and leaving at least four Afghan civilians dead, according to Afghan authorities. Officials on both sides said the clashes erupted late Friday after recent talks aimed at shoring up a fragile ceasefire failed to make progress, though each government blamed the other for firing first and for breaching understandings reached in October. The Pakistani military said its artillery targeted Taliban positions in Afghanistan’s Helmand, Kandahar and Zabul provinces, while Afghan officials reported damage to homes and shops near the frontier. The incident comes as tensions have steadily risen since the Taliban took power in Kabul in 2021 and as Islamabad accuses Kabul of allowing armed groups to stage attacks inside Pakistan, even as both sides publicly say they want to continue dialogue and keep a ceasefire alive.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/B3FRNcbvPQmx5mW-koF28FimYtI7e6k44Dy7yf19NkSmm5ax7dKJQWTpTrKgB_OzWDMGHEQ1tQLw0BeLSzxJfJO0sARW0XLECqI8VBPJXDzjzRYI-NuDJarbicJ_wQCzDJSFfwiYCYpWFTDzCX3_l2yDDcmk298pLzEoiCgXN81UTVPDnw9ZKr1BpJtsAlL5X1qOtGKG1WQqbw' alt='Trucks and travellers wait at a Pakistan–Afghanistan border crossing that has seen repeated closures during periods of tension.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ceasefire under strain: The latest shelling follows an October truce that was negotiated after previous deadly clashes but has remained shaky, with border closures and sporadic incidents continuing despite the agreement.</li><li>Disputed casualty claims: Afghan officials reported several civilians, including women and children, among the dead and injured, while Pakistani sources initially described the incident as causing no casualties on their side, underscoring the lack of shared casualty data.</li><li>Key crossings affected: The exchanges of fire occurred near important trade and aid corridors such as the Chaman and Torkham border points, which have already faced lengthy closures that disrupted commerce and cross‑border movement.</li><li>UN relief access: The border incident came shortly after Pakistan said it would permit United Nations relief supplies to transit into Afghanistan through major crossings that had been largely shut for nearly two months, a step welcomed by aid agencies.</li><li>Talks to continue: Despite the renewed violence, both governments had previously committed during their most recent round of talks to keep channels of communication open and to work on mechanisms to prevent future border flare‑ups.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Afghan Taliban authorities: Afghan officials accused Pakistani forces of launching unprovoked fire that struck civilian areas near a key crossing, saying residents bore the brunt of the shelling and reiterating that Kabul seeks respect for Afghan territorial integrity.
