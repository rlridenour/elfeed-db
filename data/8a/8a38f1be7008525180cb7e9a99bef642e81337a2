For years I&rsquo;ve had shortcuts in Firefox. In this example, I&rsquo;ve long been able to type i thing in my URL-bar and it would immediately take me to a google image search for &ldquo;thing&rdquo;. In the past this was added by right-clicking &ldquo;search&rdquo; on some page and selecting &ldquo;add a shortcut for this search&rdquo;. At some point, though, that went away. The functionality is now hidden a little, and you solve it with bookmarks (which I also haven&rsquo;t used in any form for years).
