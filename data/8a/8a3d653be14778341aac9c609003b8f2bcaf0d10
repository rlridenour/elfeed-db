The store is set to open this Friday, December 12, at 12 p.m. local time. Apple is located next to fashion retailer Coach at the shopping center.<br/>
<br/>
The new store is a replacement for Apple's previous location <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/solomonpondmall/">at Solomon Pond Mall</a>, in nearby Marlborough, Massachusetts. That location permanently closed on Wednesday, after more than 10 years of operations. When it relocates a store, Apple typically gives all employees the opportunity to transfer to the new location.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to reveal the new store, but the photo below from local resident Steve Stearns provides a sneak peek at the facade.<br/>

Apple's newer stores typically feature a dedicated counter for customers to pick up orders they placed online, and the Genius Bar has become a prominent element again in recent years. There will also be free "Today at Apple" creative sessions.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/new-apple-store-massachusetts/">New Apple Store Opening in Massachusetts Tomorrow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-store-opening-in-massachusetts-tomorrow.2474532/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
