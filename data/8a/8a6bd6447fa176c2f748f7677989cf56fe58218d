mostly monochromatic in many contexts. Styles involve the careful use
of typography, such as italics and bold italics.</p>

<p>If you want maximalist themes in terms of colour, check my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code>
package. For something in-between, which I would consider the best
“default theme” for a text editor, opt for my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code>.</p>

<h2>Version 1.0.0 on 2026-02-09</h2>

<h3>Two new themes</h3>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-jade</code> is a light theme with a predominantly green feel.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-copper</code> is a dark theme with orange, magenta, and cyan colours.</p>

<p>I have update all screenshots: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/doric-themes-pictures">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/doric-themes-pictures</a>.</p>

<h3>Revised styles for Org TODO and DONE</h3>

<p>The relevant faces now use a colour-coding scheme where TODO states
are rendered in red while DONE are green.</p>

<p>This is done to ensure cross-theme consistency. Those faces
communicate a certain state and, therefore, it is better to not have
to relearn which colour means what while switching between the Doric
themes.</p>

<h3>Org <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~code~</code> faces stand out more</h3>

<p>This is done to differentiate them from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=verbatim=</code>. It is especially
important for users who choose to hide the markup with the user option
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-hide-emphasis-markers</code> (I used to do that but realised that the
ambiguity was a problem in many cases, because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~code~</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=verbatim=</code>
have different semantics in some exported formats).</p>

<h3>Refinements to all Org heading or heading-like faces</h3>

<p>This covers the regular Org headings as well as anything that performs
the same function, such as in the Org agenda buffer.</p>

<p>All regular headings use the main foreground value. The document title
and the Org agenda equivalent of that are rendered in an accent colour
for greater effect.</p>

<p>Combined with the aforementioned revision of the TODO and DONE
states, Org buffers are easier to read and work with.</p>

<h3>Tweaks for the Org agenda faces</h3>

<p>The faces that communicate the current time and applicable filters are
made more intense. The idea is to spot them more quickly.</p>

<p>Faces that pertain to diary or diary-style events no longer use
italics to avoid exaggerations.</p>

<p>Blocked tasks are easier to spot.</p>

<p>The applicable query in the structure header is made more prominent.</p>

<p>Overall, Org agenda buffers should be easier to scan.</p>

<h3>More obvious style for Org exporting</h3>

<p>The active/available keys in the Org export dispatcher use more
intense colours and have greater padding around them. This is what I
also do with the Modus themes (and all derivatives) to improve the
legibility of those keys.</p>

<h3>Magit branch and author faces are redone</h3>

<p>The authors in log views and elsewhere have a distinct colour to stand
out a bit more. Branches use consistent typography, while the current
branch stands out more than the others.</p>

<h3>New colours for transient faces with background values</h3>

<p>Enabled and disabled keys use a green-red coding scheme.</p>

<p>Active values and arguments have a style that is the same across
themes for the same reason as Org TODO and DONE.</p>

<p>Transient headings use the main foreground colour to not draw more
attention than they need to.</p>

<h3>Git commit faces follow the aforementioned patterns</h3>

<p>Those are seen when writing a commit message in Magit.</p>

<h3>VC logs better differentiate the commit author</h3>

<p>The relevant face uses a distinct foreground. It no longer applies a
bold weight, as that had the effect of making the buffers much busier
than necessary.</p>

<h3>Colour-coded styles for Dired marks</h3>

<p>Items that are marked for selection are rendered in a green style,
while those marked for deletion are red.</p>

<p>This is done for cross-theme consistency, so that users do not have to
think twice before performing the relevant operations.</p>

<h3>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-themes-with-colors</code> macro for advanced users</h3>

<p>This macro is effectively the same as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> for binding the colours
of the active Doric theme. Advanced users can rely on this macro to
write functions that, for example, set the theme-specific red colour
value of a given face.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>Symlinks in Dired buffers are easier to spot. Same for visited links
in Info buffers.</p>

<p>Org definitions no longer override the foreground of any other face
present in them. Same for the notmuch header in view buffers.</p>
