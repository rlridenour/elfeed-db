<p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has publicly argued that Venezuela is entering a transition toward democracy and that she expects elections eventually, while also warning the route ahead will be complicated. Her comments come after a U.S. military operation on January 3 that seized Nicolás Maduro, with U.S. engagement now focused on an interim arrangement involving Delcy Rodríguez rather than an immediate handover to Machado. Machado has asked U.S. leaders to keep pressing for a democratic outcome and presented herself as ready to lead when circumstances allow, even as President Trump has questioned her level of support inside Venezuela.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fEPNZKQ_QGQc76pr9wtRULMCb_laJ0ga-yMktk8OO-yFp_SmRWV5EVEvcy--xbRPevOkoSpKxRmoyXQSVo3ZxfMfuoSQr_nE65kIGFSqf-g0Gf427uLz6LhASJXM2V383CPKYQQx0eAwQcMXuYQXLN8' alt='Maria Corina Machado speaks as Venezuela’s political future is debated in Washington.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Washington advocacy: Machado addressed an audience in Washington and urged U.S. officials to push for a democratic government, while offering few specifics about her own governing plan in the near term.</li><li>Interim leadership: Machado described a role for Delcy Rodríguez’s interim government in carrying out practical steps needed for a democratic transition, framing it as a mechanism to move the process forward.</li><li>Pro‑US pitch: In outlining her vision for Venezuela’s future, Machado portrayed her political project as strongly aligned with the United States.</li><li>US hesitation: Multiple outlets report that Washington has not formally backed Machado as the country’s leader and is instead dealing with the interim leadership structure that includes Rodríguez.</li><li>Support debate: President Trump has said Machado lacks sufficient support among Venezuelans, highlighting an unresolved question about who can credibly unify the country politically.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>María Corina Machado (Venezuelan opposition): She says Venezuela is beginning a democratic transition, expects elections eventually, and argues she has a mandate to lead when the timing is right.
