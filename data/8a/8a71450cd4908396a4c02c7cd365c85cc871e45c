<p id="p1">Today on its news site for developers, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=xcz1s7cz" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple announced</a> a new Mini Apps Partner Program for the App Store. The announcement is brief but backed by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mini-apps-partner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a more detailed explanation</a> about the eligibility requirements. Here&rsquo;s how it works.</p>
<p id="p2"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=xcz1s7cz" rel="noopener noreferrer">As Apple explains</a>, mini apps are &ldquo;self-contained experiences that are built using web technologies like HTML5 and JavaScript&rdquo; that are hosted within a native app. That&rsquo;s not something new. Companies like WeChat and Line have offered this sort of thing for a long time, and Apple has supported mini apps officially <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mini-apps-partner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">since 2017</a>. What&rsquo;s different is that now, developers who meet Apple&rsquo;s eligibility requirements can offer those mini apps at a reduced commission. That means for any mini app not made by the developer of the native app that hosts them, the hosting developer will pay Apple a flat 15% commission.</p>
<p id="p3">To be eligible for the program, developers must ensure that the mini apps they host support certain APIs, including the Declared Age Range API and the Advanced Commerce API, the In-App Purchase system, and the Send Consumption Information endpoint that enables the processing of refunds. In other words, native app developers who do the work to ensure that mini apps meet the program requirements will pay Apple a reduced commission on mini app sales in return.</p>
<p id="p4">If you&rsquo;re wondering what constitutes a mini app, Apple has provided some examples. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/mini-apps-partner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mini apps are</a> &ldquo;software packages, scripts, or game content that are added after app installation and executed on the device, provided such code is written in HTML5 or JavaScript, or another language approved by Apple&rdquo;, such as mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins, and game emulators. As I mentioned above, it&rsquo;s also important to keep in mind that mini apps are apps that are not controlled by the developer of the native app that hosts them.</p>
<p id="p5">Also, to participate in the Mini App Partner program, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/mini-apps-partner-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer">developers must apply</a> &ndash; that  link takes you to a form requesting information about the mini apps a developer wants to offer, so eligibility can be determined.</p>
<p id="p6">App Store users stand to benefit from the program, too. APIs like the Declared Age Rating API will help ensure that only age-appropriate mini apps are available to kids. Plus, by supporting the Advanced Commerce API, mini apps will include more metadata, providing users with a richer experience in places like their App Store purchase history.</p>
<p id="p7">Mini apps based on web technologies are a growing part of the App Store. The App Review Guidelines have accounted for mini apps since 2017 and the rules around them have continued to adapt to the market ever since. The Mini App Partner Program reflects the further evolution of the category, promoting privacy and transparency for users, while offering the carrot of lower commissions to developers.</p>
<p id="p8">What will be interesting to watch is the extent to which developers sign up for this new program. The program isn&rsquo;t required (although compliance with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#third-party-software" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Review Guideline 4.7</a> still applies), so it will come down to whether the reduced commission provides sufficient incentive for developers to further police the mini apps they host.</p>
