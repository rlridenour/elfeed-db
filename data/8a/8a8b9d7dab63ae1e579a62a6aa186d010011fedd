  <p>In today’s macOS 26.3 update, Apple implemented a “fix” for an
issue I blogged about a month ago, <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2026/1/4.html">macOS Tahoe broke Finder
columns view</a>. (At the behest of John Gruber and the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/applestyleguide/c-apsgb744e4a3/1.0/web/1.0#apdef2437a79d084">Apple
Style Guide</a>, I’m now using the term “column view” rather
than “columns view.”) Specifically, the issue was with the system
setting to always show scroll bars. [...]</p>

<p>Without the path bar, the columns are now taller, but the vertical
scrollers remain the same height as before, leaving vertical gaps,
a ridiculous amount of space between the bottom of the scrollers
and the bottom of the columns, looking silly and amateurish.</p>

<p>Did nobody inside Apple test this configuration either? Or do they
simply not care?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In one sense, this whole issue with column view in the Finder with scroll bars set to always show is a little thing. It was downright broken in earlier versions of MacOS 26 — you literally could not resize the columns. So now it’s not broken. But as Johnson says, it looks silly and amateurish.</p>

<p>This is the sort of detail that Apple used to strive to get pixel-perfect, all the time, for all settings. “<em>Whatever, good enough</em>” instead of “<em><a href="https://www.folklore.org/How_to_Hire_Insanely_Great_Employees.html">insanely great</a></em>”.</p>
