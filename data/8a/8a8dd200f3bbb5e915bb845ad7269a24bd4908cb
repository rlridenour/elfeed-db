Dye has been at Apple since 2006, joining the marketing and communication team as a creative director. He transitioned to Jony Ive's user interface team in 2012 to work on iOS 7, and he worked on subsequent iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS design updates. Most recently, he helped develop the Vision Pro interface, and he oversaw the rollout of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> and macOS 26 Liquid Glass design revamp.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to replace Dye with Stephen Lemay, a longtime Apple designer who joined the company over 25 years ago. In a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> praised Lemay.<br/>
<blockquote>Steve Lemay has played a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999. He has always set an extraordinarily high bar for excellence and embodies Apple's culture of collaboration and creativity.<br/>
<br/>
Design is fundamental to who we are at Apple, and today, we have an extraordinary design team working on the most innovative product lineup in our history.</blockquote><br/>
Dye is joining Meta as chief design officer on December 31, and he will help Meta in its efforts to further break into consumer hardware. Dye will head up Meta's new design studio, overseeing hardware design and software design with a focus on improving Meta devices like headsets and glasses with AI features.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alan-dye/">Alan Dye</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/apple-alan-dye-joining-meta/">Apple UI Design Chief Alan Dye Leaving for Meta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ui-design-chief-alan-dye-leaving-for-meta.2474182/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
