<li>Practice the subtle art of putting</li>
<li>Celebrate the college you went to (or cheer for on Saturdays)</li>
<li>A great gift maybe?</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: No, but if you have a margarita and one of these is around, you’re definitely taking a few swings</li>
</ul><h1>Practice Accuracy</h1><p>Gift-giving season is coming up, which is why we’re offering these: perfect little mats for practice putts that you can give to the aspiring (or seasoned) golfer in your life.</p>
<p>But mind you, these are no simple green mats. Each one is a different color and contains a design that speaks to the putter’s interests, hobbies, or personality. Which is why we’ve put together a little guide explaining who would make the perfect recipient for a few of these.</p>
<p>Check it out!</p>

<p>“Jolly ho, old chap! Perhaps we could take the lift up to your apartment for a putt and a spot of tea. That way, we shall be prepared to hit the links while on holiday!” Of course, you get the gist: a great gift for the anglophile in your life.</p>

<p>The summer? That’s for golf. But on a cold winter’s day? There’s nothing better than a few pancakes drenched in local maple syrup, a morning spent hitting the slopes of Stowe, and a grilled cheese for lunch made with some Cabot cheddar. That is, at least, if you’re a Vermonter. In which case, celebrate the best state with this Vermont-themed mat.</p>

<p>Some people can be wishy-washy. They mutter and mumble, every sentence they utter ending with that upturned diction that implies a question mark. This mat is not for them. It’s for the people who make bold declarations, take strong stances, and live by a simple mantra: “Others may stammer and insinuate, but me? I state!”</p>

<p>I think we nailed these. But there are more available, so if you have some idea what kinds of recipients <em>those</em> are intended for, do let us know in the comments.</p>
