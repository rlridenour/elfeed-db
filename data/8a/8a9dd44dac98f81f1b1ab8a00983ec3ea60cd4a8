<p>Israel&#x27;s parliament (the Knesset) approved a first reading on Monday of a bill that would permit the death penalty for people defined as &quot;terrorists,&quot; a proposal propelled by National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and backed by the security committee as a deterrent to deadly attacks. The move brings the measure onto the parliamentary agenda and has prompted heated domestic debate about law, security and judicial process.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/L_eKIcczfLPcIAi3sAQkjpvE0IxTD-LlRtlaOa2DeUxKgmVgM2-s_xK8ZEnQwYeJo001pRm43T52GmzKvtzf4m6tgsMkcPkkolMMr0W65B4YQPSrFU4_sndgRBGvTuqwAAcMkWFSAz4E_es0_uDFpnSmh_gk3RiliRyV5_WTA8qbW3aMgQ4fLuPQhY8ClDL8lTe2' alt='Palestinian lawyers protest against the proposed Israeli death penalty law in front of the Judicial Court in Hebron on November 9, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Vote margin: The bill cleared its first reading by a 39-16 margin in the Knesset vote, pushing it forward in the legislative process.</li><li>Parliamentary steps: Under Knesset procedure the proposal must now pass two further readings before it can become law.</li><li>Who would be targeted: Reporting highlights that the text is aimed primarily at Palestinians convicted of killing Israelis, an element critics say raises equality and legal-application concerns.</li><li>Legal history: Although capital punishment appears in Israeli law for a narrow set of crimes, Israel has been a de facto abolitionist state since the last execution — that of Adolf Eichmann in 1962.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Security committee / supporters: The committee framed the proposal as a way to cut off terrorism at its root and create a heavy deterrent to deadly attacks.
