<p>One productivity struggle I constantly hear from readers (and have faced myself) is keeping events and meetings organized when the details live in email. Fantastical, which Apple made “App of the Day” earlier this week, has brilliantly solved this problem with their <a href="https://flexibits.com/blog/2025/06/feature-spotlight-forward-emails-to-fantastical/">Forward Emails to Fantastical feature</a>, and I can’t imagine going back.</p>



<p>Here’s how it works: When you get an email confirming an appointment, a webinar registration, or even something informal like coffee with a friend, just forward that email directly into Fantastical. The app intelligently parses the content, extracting dates, times, locations, and participants, and automatically creates a perfectly formatted calendar entry. It’s magical—and a huge time-saver.</p>



<p>I’ve always appreciated how Fantastical seamlessly integrates into the Apple ecosystem, syncing effortlessly across my Mac, iPad, and iPhone. This latest feature just adds another layer of smart automation, eliminating manual entry and reducing the risk of typos or overlooked details. If you’re as obsessed with automation and efficiency as I am, you’ll quickly see how this small change makes a big impact.</p>



<p>Congratulations to the Fantastical team on being featured as App of the Day—it’s well-deserved recognition for continually improving an already indispensable app.</p>
