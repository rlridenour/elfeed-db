<p>This post is brought to you by <a href="https://hobancards.com">Hoban Press</a>, makers of beautiful letterpress business cards and stationery.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been handing out Hoban Cards for years. Every single time, the person on the receiving end pauses. They rub their thumb across the card. They comment on it. A business card shouldn&#8217;t be a conversation starter, but a Hoban Card is.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s because these aren&#8217;t printed on some office inkjet. Evan Calkins and his team in the Pacific Northwest hand-feed every card into antique cast iron letterpresses, some over 100 years old. The cards are printed on thick cotton stock. Crane&#8217;s Lettra, 600gsm. You can feel the impression of each letter pressed into the paper. It&#8217;s the opposite of everything digital, and that&#8217;s exactly why it works.</p>



<p><a href="https://hobancards.com">Hoban Cards</a> has over 50 templates to choose from, starting at $65. You pick a design, customize your details, and they print a short run on real letterpress equipment. If you want something fully custom with your own branding and layout, <a href="https://hobancards.com/pages/custom-letterpress-quote">they do that too</a>. They also print stationery, thank you notes, wedding invitations, coasters, and even clothing tags.</p>



<p>Since the last time Hoban sponsored the blog, I&#8217;ve discovered a new use for their stationery. I have a 1950s era typewriter, and I&#8217;ve started using it to hammer out notes to friends on Hoban stationery cards. The combination of typewritten letters pressed into that thick, embossed cotton stock looks incredible. There&#8217;s a physicality to it that you just can&#8217;t get any other way. People tell me they keep them.</p>



<p>I work in tech all day. I love my devices. But there&#8217;s a reason I keep ordering from Hoban. Some things are better when they&#8217;re analog.</p>
