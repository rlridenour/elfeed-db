<p id="p2">Amazon&rsquo;s Big Deal Days runs today and tomorrow (October 7&ndash;8), so I thought I&rsquo;d share some of the best deals I&rsquo;ve discovered so far. We&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye out for other deals and posting them on the MacStories Deals accounts on <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@MacStoriesDeals" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/macstoriesdeals.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a>, too, so be sure to follow either for the very latest finds.</p>
<p id="p3">For prices, be sure to visit <a href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/macstories/list/121PB65YD6XRR?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_aipsflist_EH4K9M49GZ615TW2AS8J" rel="noopener noreferrer">the MacStories Amazon storefront</a>.</p>
<h2 id="portable-ssds-samsung-t9-and-lexar-armor-700">Portable SSDs: <a href="https://amzn.to/4mRSTHu" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung T9</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/46PtZSF" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexar Armor 700</a></h2>

<p id="p5">Events like Big Deal Days are always a great opportunity to pick up fast external SSD storage. I&rsquo;ve used Samsung&rsquo;s T line of external drives for years, starting with the T5. Lately, I&rsquo;ve switched to <a href="https://amzn.to/4mPSHrW" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>the company&rsquo;s T9 portable SSDs</strong></a> because they feature USB 3.2 Gen 2x2, which offers the fastest transfers you can get short of something like Thunderbolt 4 or 5, delivering 2,000&nbsp;MB/s. That&rsquo;s plenty fast for working with big files or moving a bunch of smaller files from one device to another. I&rsquo;ve used the T9 for Carbon Copy Cloner backups, Time Machine backups, editing in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, and moving my ROM library from one handheld device to another, and it&rsquo;s been reliable in every case.</p>
<p id="p6">During Big Deal Days, <a href="https://amzn.to/4mPSHrW" rel="noopener noreferrer">the biggest discount is on the 2TB model</a>, with <a href="https://amzn.to/3KHyMy5" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 1TB model</a> a close second. Depending on your storage needs, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with either.</p>
<p id="p7">More recently, I also started using <a href="https://amzn.to/46PtZSF" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lexar&rsquo;s Armor 700 Portable SSD</strong></a>. In fact, it was one of these drives that we used to transfer huge video and audio files from <a href="https://appstories.net/episodes/440" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s podcast studio at WWDC</a> back to my hotel room for editing.</p>
<p id="p8">Like Samsung&rsquo;s T9, Lexar&rsquo;s drive features 2,000&nbsp;MB/s transfer speeds, plus an aluminum case for heat dissipation, a rubberized exterior to help protect against drops, and IP66 water and dust resistance. I&rsquo;ve been using the 1TB model of the Armor 700, but it&rsquo;s the 4TB model that&rsquo;s on the deepest discount during Big Deal Days.</p>

<h2 id="logitech-mx-keys-s-keys-to-go-2-and-pop-mouse">Logitech: <a href="https://amzn.to/3KFstey" rel="noopener noreferrer">MX Keys S</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3KzaLtg" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keys-to-Go 2</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/4oe34XP" rel="noopener noreferrer">POP Mouse</a></h2>
<p id="p10">Logitech has gone all-in for Amazon&rsquo;s big sales event, too. There are a bunch of keyboards, mice, and other accessories on sale, but I&rsquo;d focus on these three:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/key-1759789955672.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p12">The <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3KFstey" rel="noopener noreferrer">MX Keys S for Mac</a></strong> was my go-to keyboard for years. I&rsquo;ve switched to Apple&rsquo;s Magic Keyboard more recently, but if you&rsquo;re looking for an alternative low-profile keyboard made for the Mac, this is a great pick.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/2go-1759789954562.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p14"><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3KzaLtg" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keys-to-Go 2</a></strong> is the keyboard I throw in my bag when I need to connect to a handheld gaming device, or when I want a keyboard &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t want to carry my iPad&rsquo;s Magic Keyboard case. The replaceable watch battery it came with is still going strong, and the integrated cover keeps it from getting damaged. It&rsquo;s not the most ergonomic keyboard ever designed, but it&rsquo;s perfect for lightweight travel.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/mouse-1759789954520.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p16">I got a <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/4oe34XP" rel="noopener noreferrer">POP Mouse</a></strong> for the same reason I have Logitech&rsquo;s Keys-to-Go 2 keyboard. It&rsquo;s a good lightweight on-the-go mouse I can connect to multiple devices. I love that it comes in bright colors, too.</p>

<h2 id="displays-asus-proart-and-lg-ultragear-oled">Displays: <a href="https://amzn.to/4gXTVjy" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASUS ProArt</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/46E5BVn" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG Ultragear OLED</a></h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/disp-1759790078700.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p20">My Apple Studio Display has served me well, but I&rsquo;ve been eyeing a couple of alternatives lately that would be great for work and gaming. The first is the <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/4gXTVjy" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASUS ProArt Display PA278QV</a></strong>. Asus&rsquo; ProArt lineup is packed with excellent Studio Display alternatives that are a fraction of the cost. The PA278QV is a 27&rdquo; 1440p 75Hz IPS display with 100% sRGB, 100% Rec. 709 wide color gamut, and lots of I/O.</p>
<p id="p21">When it comes to gaming, the <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/46E5BVn" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG 27GS93QE Ultragear OLED Gaming Monitor</a></strong> is even more tempting. It features a 27&rdquo; OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate, a 0.03&nbsp;ms response time, and support for NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. That&rsquo;s a gaming word salad that adds up to an excellent display at a very good price during Big Deal Days.</p>

<h2 id="entertainment-8bitdo-ultimate-3-mode-controller-and-beats-studio-pro-headphones">Entertainment: <a href="https://amzn.to/3Wq156N" rel="noopener noreferrer">8BitDo Ultimate 3-Mode Controller</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/4nFro56" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beats Studio Pro Headphones</a></h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/8bit-1759789955611.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p24">Speaking of gaming displays, now is also a great time to pick up a controller. The <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3Wq156N" rel="noopener noreferrer">8BitDo Ultimate 3-Mode Controller</a></strong>, which was released earlier this year, is a great pick. It features Hall effect joysticks and works with the Xbox, Apple devices, Windows, and Android, making it a terrific all-around choice.</p>
<p id="p25">I&rsquo;ve had an Ultimate 3 since earlier this summer and love it. The build quality has a premium feel, and it&rsquo;s one of the most comfortable controllers I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/beats-1759789954500.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p27"><a href="https://amzn.to/4nFro56" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Beats Studio Pro Wireless Headphones</strong></a> are also on sale during Big Deal Days and pair nicely with gaming and music setups. The Studio Pros include spatial audio, active noise cancellation, lossless audio over USB-C, and 40 hours of battery life. With support for Apple and Android baked in, the Studio Pros are versatile too.</p>

<p id="p30">The <a href="https://amzn.to/3IYhWKT" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Elgato Stream Deck XLR</strong></a> is also discounted during Big Deal Days. We all use our Macs for video and audio calls more than ever. With Elgato&rsquo;s Stream Deck XLR, you can plug an XLR microphone directly into a Stream Deck and use it to automate your calls and recording sessions, all while consolidating the number of devices you need to have on your desk.</p>

<h2 id="wi-fi-7-mesh-systems-tp-links-deco-be85">Wi-Fi 7 Mesh Systems: <a href="https://amzn.to/48isUVT" rel="noopener noreferrer">TP-Link&rsquo;s Deco BE85</a></h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/deco-1759789954528.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p33">There are a bunch of Wi-Fi 7 mesh systems on sale during Big Deal Days, but I highly recommend looking at <a href="https://amzn.to/48isUVT" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>TP-Link&rsquo;s Deco BE85 system</strong></a>. Both Federico and I have been running this one since the spring, and it&rsquo;s been a big upgrade to my wireless network. I&rsquo;ve noticed the biggest difference when working with large files that I need to upload or download from my laptop and when I&rsquo;m streaming games on services like NVIDIA GeForce Now. Having used Eeros, Orbis, and Asus systems in the past, I&rsquo;ve found the TP-Link Deco system the easiest to manage and its Wi-Fi 7 support a big step up from my prior Wi-Fi setups.</p>
