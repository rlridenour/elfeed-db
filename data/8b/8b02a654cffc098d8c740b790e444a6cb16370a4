<blockquote>
  <p>Porn sites may have blown up Meta’s key defense in a copyright
fight with book authors who earlier this year <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/">said that Meta
torrented</a> “at least 81.7 terabytes of data across multiple
shadow libraries” to train its AI models. [...]</p>

<p>After authors revealed Meta’s torrenting, Strike 3 Holdings
checked its proprietary BitTorrent-tracking tools designed to
detect infringement of its videos and alleged that the company
found evidence that Meta has been torrenting and seeding its
copyrighted content for years — since at least 2018. Some of the
IP addresses were clearly registered to Meta, while others
appeared to be “hidden,” and at least one was linked to a Meta
employee, the filing said.</p>

<p>According to Strike 3 Holdings, Meta “willfully and intentionally”
infringed “at least 2,396 movies” as part of a strategy to
download terabytes of data as fast as possible by seeding popular
high-quality porn. Supposedly, Meta continued seeding the content
“sometimes for days, weeks, or even months” after downloading
them, and these movies may also have been secretly used to train
Meta’s AI models, Strike 3 Holdings alleged.</p>

<p>The porn site operator explained to the court that BitTorrent’s
protocol establishes a “tit-for-tat” mechanism that “rewards users
who distribute the most desired content.” It alleged that Meta
took advantage of this system by “often” pirating adult videos
that are “often within the most infringed files on BitTorrent
websites” on “the very same day the motion pictures are released.”</p>

<p>Meta is an empty husk of a company with no values, no beliefs, other than growth and dominance for the sake of growth and dominance.</p>
