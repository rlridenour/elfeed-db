<p>The U.S. Justice Department sued on Thursday to block congressional district boundaries in California that voters approved last week, filing a complaint in federal court that targets a map pushed by Governor Gavin Newsom. The measure was presented by state Democrats as a response to Republican-drawn maps in other states and could change how many House seats California awards in 2026, a shift that may affect which party controls the U.S. House. The filing sets up a high-stakes legal and political fight between the Republican presidential administration and California’s Democratic leadership ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/6xIfd4IHq1q0asu8uoOr7j9iE0oWvUlSCOKWZvi8P1reRYyTLYrtnVzDIavHpE1CXBwVVoGKbiKJ26Is9EYPXyVxO1-MA3YzG9geb39HXC3-qeKI7YtvQ3X0wZ4Iuz6dkItwAaQExUOCggz29NUr7QT5B26KZDrNQanYhb9UIAiNp8j2ixZmQpXDBOgivccC3eqPQNbcklj4MoBSZkBcwFXbMhf04Rtf9VrjJgPNOz_1Z96MMu8k-jgYnxGcisDwFG8SZJcYgCRH_koBdyMo' alt='US justice department joins lawsuit to block California’s new electoral map' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who filed: California Republicans originally brought the federal lawsuit and the Justice Department intervened as a plaintiff on Thursday.</li><li>Ballot name: Voters approved the congressional redraw through Proposition 50 last week, the ballot measure that enacted the new map.</li><li>Political stakes: News reports frame the clash as a high-profile showdown between President Trump’s administration and Gov.
