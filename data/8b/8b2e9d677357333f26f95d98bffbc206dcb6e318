The key change across all three devices is the M5 chip, for faster performance.<br/>
<br/>
The updated 14-inch MacBook Pro base model also offers up to 2× faster SSD read and write speeds compared to the equivalent previous-generation model.<br/>
<br/>
The twice-as-fast SSD speeds extend to the new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models, which also received Apple's custom N1 chip with Wi-Fi 7 support, Apple's custom C1X modem for cellular configurations, the ability to drive external displays at up to a 120Hz refresh rate, and faster charging capabilities (up to 50% in 30 to 35 minutes).<br/>
<br/>
The updated Vision Pro gained 120Hz support, up from the previous 100Hz limit, and it ships with a more comfortable Dual Knit Band with tungsten counterweights.<br/>
<br/>
At all Apple Store locations where the Vision Pro is available, customers can now demo the updated model with the M5 chip, and try the Dual Knit Band.<br/>
