<p>The Antelope and Cantelope<br />
Lie side by side upon the slope,<br />
And careless persons might, I fear,<br />
Mistake the melon for the deer.<br />
If you will tap the Cantelope, reposing on the ground,<br />
It does not move, but just emits a melon-choly sound;<br />
But should you try, however, to apply a stethoscope,<br />
And attempt this auscultation on the antlered Antelope,<br />
And should see an imitation of a very rapid flight,<br />
And should say, &#8220;It is the Antelope!&#8221; I think you would be right.</p>
