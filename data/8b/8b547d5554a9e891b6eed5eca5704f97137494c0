This was a prayer I delivered at NorthHaven Church in Norman for the Christmas Day service on December 25, 2011. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Gracious Father,
</p>

 <p>
We gather here in this place to celebrate the day the world changed. <br></br>
On that day, one who was pure spirit became incarnate; <br></br>
The eternal Word became clothed in a frail human body; <br></br>
That which no human had ever touched was laid by a gentle mother’s hand into a simple manger; <br></br>
The eternal and timeless now had a beginning; <br></br>
The infinite became finite; <br></br>
On that day, God became human.
</p>

 <p>
While still in the garden, we began to build a wall; <br></br>
A wall that separated ourselves from you; <br></br>
A wall which we built, but could never tear down. <br></br></p>

 <p>
You tore down the wall when you brought your firstborn into the world, <br></br>
and said to that babe in the manger, <br></br></p>

 <p>
“You are my son; this day I have begotten you.”
</p>

 <p>
You have spoken to us in many ways, through the prophets, through the beauty of nature, and through the voice of conscience.
</p>

 <p>
On that first Christmas day, though, you spoke has you had never spoken before.
</p>

 <p>
Lord, here we are, <br></br>
Help us to listen, <br></br>
Help us to hear.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
