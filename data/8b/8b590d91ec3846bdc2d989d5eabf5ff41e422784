Just a quickie today. Jack Baty has a <a href="https://baty.net/posts/2026/02/global-org-capture-shortcut-in-kde/">short post</a> on how he enables Org capture from anywhere on his system. He does pretty much what I do except that I use <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/yequake">yequake</a> instead of his custom script.

Yequake probably handles the edge cases but either way you simply evoke Emacs and ask it to run a bit of custom Elisp. If you aren&rsquo;t doing something like this, you should take a look at Baty&rsquo;s post or Alphapappa&rsquo;s yequake. No matter where you are, you can bring up your capture menu and bring notes or a browser link into Emacs. I use it many times a day, especially for capturing items that I might want to write about in Irreal.

This is just another example of how Emacs can ease your workflow. You simply pop up an Emacs frame, capture you note, and deal with it later. It&rsquo;s about as easy a way of capturing a quick note without breaking you out of the flow as you can get. If Emacs is at the center of your workflow, you should definitely check out Baty&rsquo;s post or Alphapappa&rsquo;s yequake.</p>
