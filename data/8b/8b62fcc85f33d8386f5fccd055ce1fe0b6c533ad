Apple launched the 2024 &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, and it is able to charge them at up to 25W. For the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 models to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, charging is capped at 15W.<br/>
<br/>
Because firmware updates are released quietly over the air, Apple does not provide release notes. We don't know what new features or bug fixes might be included in the software.<br/>
