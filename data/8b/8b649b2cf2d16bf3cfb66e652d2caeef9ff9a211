<p>Apparently now you can run Jupyter notebooks in a browser without a server with WebAssembly using <a href="https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">JupyterLite</a>?? I learned
about this because <a href="https://github.com/paddymul/">@paddymul</a> made a pull request to my
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook">pandas-cookbook</a> repo to add support for it.</p>
<p>So now you can <a href="https://jvns.github.io/pandas-cookbook/lab/index.html">try out the cookbook in your browser</a>. It seems to work!</p>
