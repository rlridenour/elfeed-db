  <p>The surprise announcement, made less than two months after <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/max-changes-logo-black-and-white-hbo-1236352161/">Max
tweaked its logo</a> to look more like the classic black-and-white HBO
color scheme, was revealed at Warner Bros. Discovery’s upfront
presentation to ad execs in New York on Wednesday.</p>

<p>In a press release, WBD said “returning the HBO brand into HBO Max
will further drive the service forward and amplify the uniqueness
that subscribers can expect from the offering. It is also a
testament to WBD’s willingness to keep boldly iterating its
strategy and approach — leaning heavily on consumer data and
insights — to best position itself for success.”</p>

<p>Everyone should be clear on what to make fun of here. We should <em>not</em> be making fun of the fact that they’re changing the name back to HBO Max. No one likes to admit to mistakes. It’s intensely uncomfortable. And people who are good at politics and PR are good at spinning mistakes as not-mistakes. We should, in fact, congratulate them for admitting to this dumb fucking mistake and <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250514/p27#a250514p27">re-embracing the “HBO” name</a>.</p>

<p>What we should be making fun of is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/warner_max">the original decision</a> to name the platform “Max”, which was obviously stupid at the time, and has been obviously stupid every single day since. “Max” is one of those trendy words like “Plus” and “Pro” that companies append to their brand names when naming premium tiers. You can’t just name a service “Max” or “Plus” or “Pro” without any other words. It’s stupid. And to make it worse, Warner Bros. Discovery (itself an incredibly awkward and dumb-sounding name — just call the company “Warner Brothers” or “Warner” — no one gives a shit about Discovery) already owned the brand name that stands for “prestige TV”: HBO. They already owned it. People loved it. And now they’re like, “<em>Oh, geez, I guess we should use that?</em>”</p>

<p>I wrote two years ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/13/zaslav-hbo-max">that David Zaslav might be stupid</a>. That it took him two entire years to reverse this name change proves that there’s no maybe about it — he <em>is</em> stupid. If you were interviewing candidates to be the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery (a dumb name that a good candidate for the job should suggest changing), and one of them told you that they’d like to name the company’s streaming service “Max” — just “Max” — you should end the interview right there. If I were interviewing someone for the job and they insisted that they were serious about removing “HBO” from the name of the service I’d start wondering if I smelled alcohol on them. If you had Dr. Evil-style ejector chairs you’d dump them into the shark tank or whatever. But instead, they hired the guy who thought “Max” was a great name. It’s absolutely unreal how much brand equity Zaslav has squandered.</p>
