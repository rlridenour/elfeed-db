The career path of a manager from graduation on her way to the boardroom is full of unexpected surprises. It might sometimes even feel like you are playing the ancient Indian board game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders">Snakes &amp; Ladders</a>, known to Americans as <em>Chutes &amp; Ladders</em>. </p>
<p>
At the Lucid Manager, we have created the ultimate career simulation with <em>Corporate Snakes and Ladders</em> to express the trials and tribulations of a professional career. Who will get to the boardroom first?</p>

<p>The objective of the <em>Corporate Snakes &amp; Ladders</em> is to navigate by rolling a die, from your graduation (the bottom-left square) to the boardroom (top-right square). On your career journey you are either helped or hindered by ladders or corporate snakes. This game is based on the articles on the Half-Hour MBA, which help you to become a Lucid Manager.</p>
<p>
Studying to obtain an MBA and buying a <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/managers-new-clothes/">new suit</a> will certainly help you in your career. Be careful though of <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/self-knowledge-for-managers/">personality tests</a>, you might give the wrong answers! As your career progresses you are expected to start <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/myth-of-multitasking/">multitasking</a> but alas it does not make you more productive.</p>
<p>
The secrets behind the corporate veil are lifted once you realise that <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/magician-manager/">perception is reality</a> and that <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/generation-y/">Generation Y does not exist</a>, which helps you to manage your middle management stress, for which you are grateful.</p>
<p>
At the end of the game, you might or might not enter the board room. The main purpose of this career simulator is to help you recognise the illusions of management. A business or any other organsiation is <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/buddhist-management/">merely a human construct</a> that has no objective reality.</p>
