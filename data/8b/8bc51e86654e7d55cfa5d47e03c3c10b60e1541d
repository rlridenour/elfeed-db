<li>Loren made some text filters for Markdown in BBEdit. They are fantastic. <a href="https://ldstephens.net/blog/update-bbedit-markdown-text-filters-available-on-git-hub/" target="_blank">Update - BBEdit Markdown Text Filters available on GitHub</a></li>
<li>iA Writer got some recognition and this is how they reacted to it. Great design of an iconic product. <a href="https://ia.net/topics/apple-design-award-2025" target="_blank">Apple Design Award Finalist After 15 Years</a></li>
<li>Loren makes an argument I can’t refute. I have been thinking of my relationship with Apple and find myself in a similar space. I am pissed off enough to be considering a move away from it, but it is difficult to pull off. The only alternative I would consider is Linux, but that is another learning curve I don’t need in my life. So, I am stuck here. And that is not a good feeling. <a href="https://ldstephens.net/blog/on-putting-your-eggs-in-one-basket/" target="_blank">On - Putting Your Eggs in One Basket</a></li>
