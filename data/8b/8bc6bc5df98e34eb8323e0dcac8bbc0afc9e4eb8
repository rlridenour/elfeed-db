The store is set to open on Friday, December 12, at 12 p.m. local time. Apple is located next to fashion retailer Coach at the shopping center.<br/>

Apple has yet to share a photo of the store, but it will have a similar design as its <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/birkdalevillage/">Birkdale Village location</a> in North Carolina. Apple's newer stores typically feature a dedicated counter for customers to pick up orders they placed online.<br/>

The new store is a replacement for Apple's existing location <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/solomonpondmall/">at Solomon Pond Mall</a>, in nearby Marlborough, Massachusetts. That location will be closing permanently next month, after more than 10 years of operations. For relocations like these, Apple typically gives employees the opportunity to transfer to the new store.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/21/new-apple-store-in-massachusetts/">New Apple Store Opening in Massachusetts Next Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-store-opening-in-massachusetts-next-month.2471652/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
