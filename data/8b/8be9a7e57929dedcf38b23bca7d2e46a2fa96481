Orgmode exported to latex automatically renders lists into enumerate blocks. The trick was to insert some parameters WITHIN that enumerate block to tweak a particular list output. The answer1 turned out to lie in the #+ATTR_LATEX: command, as follows:
Orgmode In #+ATTR_LATEX: :options \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt} \setlength{\parskip}{0pt} \setlength{\parsep}{0pt} 1. first 2. second 3. third Latex Out \begin{enumerate} \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt} \setlength{\parskip}{0pt} \setlength{\parsep}{0pt} \item first \item second \item third \end{enumerate} Footnotes 1 StackExchange for this question, including the answer from NickD: https://emacs.
