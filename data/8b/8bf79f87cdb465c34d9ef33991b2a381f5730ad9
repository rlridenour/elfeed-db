Over the last few months, rumors around the iPhone 18 Pro's front-panel design have been conflicted, with some supply-chain leaks pointing to under-display Face ID, reports suggesting a top-left hole-punch camera, and debate over whether the familiar Dynamic Island will shrink, shift, or disappear entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/QnYtwz9Bh">Instant Digital</a> shared new details that appear to clarify the situation.<br/>
<br/>

According to the leaker, early reports from Chinese and Korean sources about the possible relocation of an infrared Face ID component were later mistranslated in some English-language coverage as a visible left-side hole-punch front camera. That leap conflated different Face ID elements and overlooked how Apple typically evolves its front sensor layout, allowing a minor internal change to be misread as a major external redesign. <br/>
<br/>
To illustrate, Instant Digital shared an image (below) of a Face ID sensor assembly made up of three distinct modules mounted on a single flex cable: an infrared flood illuminator on the left, and a centered dot projector with an infrared camera to its right.<br/>
<br/>
Crucially, the leaker is suggesting the layout shows that the flood illuminator – being relatively small and optically simple – is the only Face ID component likely to be placed under the display, in the top-left area of the screen. The dot projector and infrared camera, by contrast, would remain centered and housed within a reduced, pill-shaped Dynamic Island, where the selfie camera would also remain.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, <em>The Information</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/iphone-18-pro-features-report/">reported</a> that the front camera would be moved to the top-left corner of the display on iPhone 18 Pro models, explicitly claiming this change would eliminate the pill-shaped cutout. Instant Digital now appears to be pushing back on that interpretation.<br/>
<br/>

In short, reports of a top-left hole-punch camera on the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max now appear to be incorrect. The only visible change suggested by the leak is a smaller, centered Dynamic Island – as per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-16/apple-iphone-17-air-foldable-iphone-details-ai-crisis-to-haunt-top-100-event-m8bl3a9c">some</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/iphone-18-pro-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/">reports</a> – enabled by relocating the IR flood illuminator outside of it and under the display. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is likely to unveil the iPhone 18 Pro models in September. Barring any more conflicting rumors, we now have a clearer picture of what to expect the front display to look like. <br/>
