<p>Watching the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Joanna Stern <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/apple-intelligence-ai-strategy-siri-627ce650">push back against Craig Federighi and Greg Joswiak</a> about Siri&#8217;s shortcomings brought me some relief. Not in the way it put the two executives on their heels, but instead in my knowledge of the mark questions like that leave on you. </p>



<p>I know because I&#8217;ve been the subject of those kinds of questions myself (usually from someone wearing a black robe). The one effect that sort of questioning always had on me was to go back to the office and get things sorted and fixed, <em>so I never had to answer questions like that again. </em>I hope Craig and Joz are feeling the same emotions. The looks on their faces tell me they are.</p>
