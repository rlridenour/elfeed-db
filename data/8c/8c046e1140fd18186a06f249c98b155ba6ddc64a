<p>President Trump signed a charter in Davos on Jan. 22 to formally launch a new “Board of Peace,” an international body he says will help oversee a ceasefire and broader peace efforts related to Israel’s war with Hamas, while also aiming to address other conflicts over time. Leaders and representatives from 19 countries appeared as founding members at the World Economic Forum signing ceremony, with much of the participation coming from the Middle East, parts of Europe, and the Americas. Several traditional U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom, held back from joining at the launch, citing concerns about the body’s mandate and possible Russian President Vladimir Putin involvement. Trump presented the board as a potentially influential venue that would work alongside the United Nations, though reporting also noted skepticism and uncertainty about how it will operate in practice.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/oSrkCwFWvQzma4pOC_h4J0Pdlh89pct3NxhCr21z3RoGzAD1bZTHG1q7YVn3rcNElhcuXmCQVrvA2jvZJV135AKF84ynRts3ieKmos8Kx6rTgb_tnqoP1E4F6P-X5tpkcQ-blqJUOPVGainhesQeOUDjCqxGUlimDUXSsqT9ATb117q-Qoq7ECbDJJmNdztnf4mFUkgvvp67oq9_UPVMI_YJy3zBUvret2TubSVhk0lCkOoCLk7wBaLzxfc0f1gqEWf-t43sqBPNJwN1NA' alt='U.S. President Donald Trump holds a signed founding charter at the Board of Peace meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Membership terms: Reporting on the draft charter says countries receive three-year membership terms, while states that contribute $1 billion in cash within the first year can obtain permanent membership.</li><li>UN linkage: The board grew out of President Trump’s 20-point Gaza ceasefire plan that sources say was endorsed by the UN Security Council, and Trump has framed the new body as working “with many others, including the U.N.”.</li><li>Leadership model: Several outlets highlighted that the board’s structure concentrates decision-making authority with President Trump personally, including reported provisions that would let him retain a leadership role beyond his presidency.</li><li>Gaza redevelopment pitch: At the Davos event, Jared Kushner presented a pitch for rebuilding Gaza that included ideas such as coastal resorts and energy infrastructure, alongside Trump’s public discussion of “New Gaza” plans.</li><li>Russia fee dispute: RFE/RL and Time reported that Putin signaled openness to contributing $1 billion but said Russia would need access to assets frozen in the U.S. to fund such a payment.</li></ul><blockquote>We’ll work with many others, including the United Nations, - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration / President Trump: The White House presented the Board of Peace as a new mechanism to help maintain a Gaza ceasefire and potentially take on broader conflict-resolution work, with Trump saying many countries want to participate and that it can work alongside the UN.
