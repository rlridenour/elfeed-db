<p>A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed a 37-year-old woman, identified as Renee Nicole Good, on a residential street in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Wednesday as federal agents carried out an immigration enforcement operation in the city. Video from the scene shows agents converging around her SUV; as the vehicle moves away, an agent fires multiple shots and the SUV then crashes into parked vehicles. President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security said the shooting was self-defense, alleging Good tried to use her vehicle against agents, while Minneapolis leaders said the video undermines that account and demanded ICE leave the city. The death sparked large protests and vigils in freezing conditions, reflecting broader tensions over the Trump administration’s intensified immigration enforcement efforts.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/J15CHV7mqMlQRl0MM32pV5HcBUSjyvOjkCoQakS3O5SPYFWVKGL1iMHqt0pqfqhhP_gAEPBBGnnGfDrnV3uVU_o0IcMpNYg0KIZqVfR7fzj1' alt='Minneapolis police secure the area as community members gather near the scene of the fatal shooting, Jan. 7, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who she was: Family and profiles described Good as a U.S.-born mother of three who wrote poetry and had recently moved to Minneapolis.</li><li>How it unfolded: Police officials said her vehicle was blocking a road when federal agents approached, and shots were fired as the SUV drove off.</li><li>Crowd response: After the shooting, thousands gathered near the scene and some protesters threw snowballs during confrontations with law enforcement, as anger focused on ICE’s presence in the city.</li><li>Enforcement surge: The operation came amid a ramp-up of federal immigration enforcement: DHS previously announced a campaign to recruit 10,000 additional ICE agents on top of roughly 6,000 already in the agency.</li><li>Local security planning: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz criticized the federal operation’s approach and, according to local reporting referenced in live coverage, ordered preparations to ready the National Guard amid unrest concerns.</li></ul><blockquote>Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly - that is bullshit. - Jacob Frey</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration (President Trump): President Trump said he viewed the clip and argued the officer shot in self-defense, describing the driver as obstructing and claiming she ran over the officer, while blaming a “radical left” climate for violence against law enforcement.
