Sony <a href="https://howl.link/n92jnco8kj42u">today announced</a> a new set of earbuds that are designed to compete with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a>. The &#36;330 WF-1000XM6 Truly Wireless Earbuds feature Active Noise Cancellation with a 25 percent reduction in noise compared to the prior-generation XM5 earbuds, with improved performance in the mid-to-high frequency range that's common in everyday environments.<br/>

The earbuds use Sony's HD Noise Canceling Processor QN3e with an adaptive noise canceling optimizer and four microphones on each earbud to detect sound to cut out. The earbuds analyze external noise and wearing conditions in real time to improve noise canceling performance.<br/>
<br/>
Sony's XM6 earbuds are smaller than the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; because there is no stem, and they include noise isolating silicone ear tips with a USB-C charging case. Sony redesigned the earbuds with a more ergonomic shape that's meant to follow the natural curves of the inner ear to reduce discomfort, and the XM6 is 11 percent slimmer than the XM5. The updated design also reduces internal noises like footsteps and chewing sounds.<br/>
<br/>
The battery in the XM6 earbuds lasts for up to eight hours, and the charging case provides an additional 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
More processing power delivers better sound, and Sony says the earbuds have a new driver unit that combines different materials on the dome and the edge. The soft edge offers deep bass, while the rigid dome provides clear and extended high frequencies. Sony is also using AI to restore compressed files in real time to improve sound quality.<br/>
<br/>
For phone calls, there are two microphones and a bone conduction sensor on each side, with the earbuds using AI beamforming to isolate and capture the wearer's voice even in crowded environments.<br/>
<br/>
Sony offers Adaptive Sound Control, Auto Play, multi-device support, and integrated voice assistance, with Google Gemini Live built in.<br/>
<br/>
Reviews suggest the WF-1000XM6 earbuds are almost on par with the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; when it comes to noise cancellation. According to <em><a href="https://www.soundguys.com/sony-wf-1000xm6-review-152013/">SoundGuys</a></em>, the XM6 had an 88 percent average reduction in loudness across all frequencies, just behind the 90 percent average of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;. Passive isolation was better than the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; passive sound reduction.<br/>
