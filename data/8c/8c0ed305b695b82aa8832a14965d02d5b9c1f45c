<p>Sri Lanka is grappling with severe floods and landslides caused by Cyclone Ditwah, with authorities reporting at least 56 deaths and dozens of people still missing as of Friday. The storm brought more than 300 millimetres of rain in 24 hours to parts of the island, particularly the eastern and central highland districts, where many fatalities occurred when hillsides collapsed onto homes and roads. In response, the government ordered all state offices and schools to close, suspended some train services, and curtailed trading at the Colombo Stock Exchange so rescue teams and citizens could focus on safety during continuing heavy rainfall. Disaster management officials say nearly 44,000 people have moved into public shelters such as schools, while military units, emergency crews, and helicopters from neighbouring India work to reach cut‑off villages and evacuate those stranded on rooftops.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wya9IqAHdCzAMmk9FzysUsRn3gxPYO92xmBef_E4AkIJ2-n4mtTeEzlcjb0EtLWTEI639a3XLO75MIUnV8MPryl3KEzivSRXB1hI-wvf_dEh' alt='Homes partially submerged after torrential rains from Cyclone Ditwah in Kelaniya, near Colombo.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Worst‑hit regions: Central tea‑growing districts including Badulla and Nuwara Eliya have recorded some of the highest casualty figures, with at least 25 deaths in those areas alone as saturated slopes gave way.</li><li>Transport disruption: Authorities halted several train services, while blocked and damaged roads have made it difficult for rescue teams to access remote villages in hilly terrain.</li><li>Air traffic changes: Sri Lanka has already diverted several international flights from Bandaranaike International Airport and may reroute more to airports in India’s Trivandrum or Cochin if weather conditions deteriorate further.</li><li>Stock exchange measures: The Colombo Stock Exchange ended trading early to reduce travel during the storm and allow staff and investors to return home before conditions worsened.</li><li>Indian assistance: India agreed to deploy helicopters from its aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, docked in Colombo, to bolster ongoing rescue and relief operations across affected regions.</li></ul><blockquote>We are doing our best to get everyone to safety - Brigadier S.
