<p>The Trump administration says it is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somali nationals in the United States, a program that provides deportation relief and work authorization. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the change is based on the administration’s assessment that conditions in Somalia have improved enough that the legal basis for the designation no longer applies. Somali TPS holders have been told to depart by March 17, 2026, or risk deportation. The decision lands amid heightened tension in Minnesota—home to the largest Somali community in the U.S.—where federal immigration activity and protests have drawn national attention.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/paxRdrswzavvSvAmc1rLqBWu0T_a_dEaNxy25es5y9KDGvlfYnv_HA_k5HnaBvN3HkBIzABtOU7-MszxYSTBGvjJZ_2f6K7aq7m3VTH45BdaCGdbaWbz_JJKEnS4L4OdOPtmSMX5thAwXsbJ74CVa1pCt8tlEZjsu-bRCuZspj7BFr5UNeTQTYOwHdAX8YVU9v3EZC2-l-RM_ZWtEc1ZRiBTMlgMllAw2VqW_d6AWgW4V2t1BCCwxkPeexjh_vVthN7L1wW826Z2X8BwdA' alt='U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks during a press conference in New York, Jan. 8, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Minnesota focus: Several reports tie the move to a broader escalation in Minnesota, describing intensified street protests in Minneapolis as federal immigration enforcement increased in the area.</li><li>Fraud allegations: The administration has publicly alleged large-scale public benefit fraud within Minnesota’s Somali community, a claim it has highlighted alongside the crackdown.</li><li>DHS messaging: DHS posted on X that it is “ENDING Temporary Protected Status for Somalians in the United States,” accompanying the announcement with a directive for affected people to leave.</li><li>Community scale: Minnesota’s Somali community is described as the largest in the country, with around 80,000 members, which is why the TPS change resonates strongly there.</li><li>Public safety costs: Local officials cited significant policing expenses around recent unrest, with Minneapolis Police reporting a $2 million overtime bill for January 8–11.</li></ul><blockquote>Our message is clear.
