<p>The United States has accused China of carrying out a secret nuclear explosive test in 2020 — a claim President Donald Trump hinted at late last year, but with fewer details. US officials and related coverage have linked the allegation to Washington’s push for updated arms-control talks that would include China and Russia alongside the United States as New START lapses. A monitoring group cited in some coverage said it has found no evidence to back the US claim, underscoring how hard it is to verify alleged underground tests from outside a country’s borders.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Kd1ErBLpxckxpDFz7ikra-ULpD6EAeDzWC-VZ1LBkPqwH6sDV4XQTgBHqw5aRxu22kUkcoajWAYDQSwAaaG9tGzSzIQAFfCbFKLQsLOJz4ZhsPa9qI6SM2_n19Hejqbyh3jA9DlVofekChcFvaDAufMcIMyeFhZ-R4usUlGrKilHL86dZM2rzF1t7GzLq_bbwxwQG3TtCrR0AhK_3hPjZomzReDhuAMIs16zmS9Hf2C6D0R7hnxsVSit' alt='President Donald Trump is shown in a photo used with coverage of the allegations.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Timing: The accusation landed as (and in one account, a day after) Washington floated a broad new arms-control framework that would include China, Russia, and the US after New START.</li><li>Test-ban context: A US official said China’s alleged lack of disclosure would run against an understanding tied to the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which both countries signed but neither has ratified.</li><li>Arsenal claims: One account coupled the test allegation with US assertions that China is expanding its nuclear arsenal.</li><li>Trump remarks: The Hindu reported that President Trump hinted at similar accusations late last year, but without the level of detail in the latest reporting.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States government: US officials accused China of conducting a secret nuclear explosive test in 2020, and framed the allegation as part of a broader push to bring China into arms-control talks alongside Russia.
