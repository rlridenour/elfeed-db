</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
What Computering Should Be
</p>
        <p>This is my contribution to <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/08/05/emacs-carnival-2025-08-your-elevator-pitch-for-emacs/">Emacs Carnival 2025-08: Your Elevantor Pitch for Emacs</a>.</p>
<p>First, I need a pithy statement (or set of statements).</p>
<ul>
<li>Emacs: because telling your computer what to do has never felt so good</li>
<li>Emacs: a hobby unto itself</li>
<li>Emacs: find out what your computer can do for you</li>
<li>Emacs: bound only by your imagination</li>
<li>Emacs: around since the days of lead-tipped lawn darts and still just as
impactful</li>
<li>Emacs: a key to unlock your potential</li>
<li>Emacs: the hokey religion and ancient weapon one smuggler once denounced</li>
</ul>
<p>There, those should catch the attention of my elevator companions.  Now that I
have their attention, with a half-dozen or so catch phrases, I dive into the
pitch.</p>
<p>“How many people are using the same applications now as they were when they got
their first computer?  And over time, how has those applications changed?
Billing models?  Menu options?  Configurations?  Interoperability?  Proprietary
formats?  What was discontinued?”</p>
<p>The few in the elevator brace themselves, another crank, at least he’s not
chanting “The End is Nigh” they think.  One looks up just a bit curious,
unfortunately, I those were rhetorical questions so I keep going.</p>
<p>“I do a lot of writing and reading on a computer…a lot.  From reading articles,
PDFs, documents, code, email, and social media.  I also do a lot of writing.
Reports, code, blog posts, emails, and probably more.”</p>
<p>That one person nods along; as though maybe I’ve found at least someone
recognizing that they too do much of the same thing.</p>
<p>“All of this is through the medium of plain text.  And I’ve found an application
that allows me to do all of this.  Without those end-user licenses agreements in
which I sign away all kinds of rights, often for the benefit of that software
also spying on me.”</p>
<p>Another person, bored with their phone, looks up, just a bit.  Maybe curious.</p>
<p>“Emacs is that one application for me.  As much as I can, I use Emacs for all of
this.  The main idea being that getting better with using this one application
means I get better at doing that long list of things.  And by better, I mean
more consistently and likely requiring less time.  And thus making time for
other things I might consider important.”</p>
<p>The elevator dings, and halts.  The doors open and a few depart.  Two pause just
a moment then also depart.  And one, who started towards the door, stops and
says, “Tell me more.”</p>
<p>I smirk and continue, “It’s hard to tell you about all that Emacs can do, in
part because when you run Emacs you have the option to change everything about
it.”</p>
<p>Folks now wrinkle their nose, as this starts to sound a bit far-fetched.</p>
<p>“It works well out of the box, but as you find how you work with reading and
writing, you have the opportunity to change that.  Maybe by installing packages
that other people have written and maintained, or by recording and replaying a
macro that you seem to do all of the time.”</p>
<p>“Folks, I adopted Emacs in <time datetime="2020" title="2020">2020</time> and haven’t looked back.  I closed my previous
Mail, Note-Taking, News, Document Writing applications and shifted those
functions into Emacs.  It might sound fantastical, especially in today’s narrow
focus applications, but think about how these digital forms shift as you work
with them.  An email or online ticket becomes a bit of code which you then need
to reference in a README, including examples…and keeping them up to date.  You
can stay in Emacs to do all of that.”</p>
<p>People’s eyes start glazing over.  It is perhaps too much.</p>
<p>“Folks, Emacs doesn’t look fancy.  Some might say it looks retro.  But it does
one thing really well: it helps you tell the computer what to do.  And you don’t
need to start with it doing all of the things.  Instead, just consider writing
documents with it.  Maybe read the posts from the <a href="https://gregnewman.io/blog/emacs-carnival-2025-07-writing-experience/">”Writing Experience“ posts
from the July 2025 Emacs Carnival</a>.  Or watch some presentations from <a href="https://emacsconf.org">Emacs
Conference</a>.”</p>
<p>The elevator dings, and I say “Welp, this is my floor.  I hope I’ve given you
something to consider.  And I part with saying that Emacs is a tool that rewards
practice, I tried to pick it up twice before the third time.  And it was once I
started practicing that it stuck.”</p>
