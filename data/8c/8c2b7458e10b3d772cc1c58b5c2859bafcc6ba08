<p>Cloudflare suffered an hours-long global outage, starting around 12pm UTC / 7am ET, which brought down an enormous chunk of the Internet. This included, <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1990754173957369989">humorously</a>, <a href="https://downdetector.com/">Down Detector</a>. It also included (not so humorously to me) Daring Fireball, which has been <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/09/df_slowdown">routed through Cloudflare since 2018</a>. My apologies if you tried to reach the site while it was down. (DF was back up by the time I woke up this morning.) As of this writing, Cloudflare still hasn’t determined exactly what happened, but they’ve been updating <a href="https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/8gmgl950y3h7">their status report for the incident</a> a few times per hour. The most recent update:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We continue to monitor the system through recovery and we are
seeing errors and latency return to normal levels. A full
post-incident investigation and details about the incident will be
made available asap.</p>
