Considering the format of daily sketches
2025-09-03-06
</p>

<p>
The iPad is comfortable to draw on in landscape mode, so for the past few months, I've been drawing my daily moments as <a href="https://sketches.sachachua.com/tags/monthly">monthly calendars</a>. Before then, I used to draw a <a href="https://sketches.sachachua.com/tags/moment">dozen daily sketches</a> on one page. And long before that, <a href="https://sketches.sachachua.com/tags/daily">daily index cards</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some people draw fancier sketches. These ones are <a href="https://www.draketo.de/kreatives/best-thing-today">ArneBab's</a>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How he started in Aug 2022</li>
<li>Latest one: Aug 2025</li>
</ul>
<p>
I like the varied sizes, colours
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.tannymcgregor.com/sketchnotes">Tanny McGregor</a> has a colourful calendar. (5 minutes a day? Hmm&hellip;)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>but this is from 2020</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's Winnie Lim. This one's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHFlFCwhtX8/">Jan 2025</a>.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I'll try putting more time into it. Just doodle. It's okay to slow down.
</p>

<p>
What do I want from my sketches?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Moments I might not have photos of: sketches don't have to be photorealistic, although it might be good to get a better sense of what we feel like, and then what we look like</li>
<li>Playfully stretching my skills
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>details</li>
<li>shading</li>
<li>colour</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Maybe I can try <a href="https://procreate.com/">Procreate</a>? Easy layers, colour fill.</li>
<li>Stick with <a href="http://getnoteful.com/">Noteful</a> for now - nice to work with notebooks</li>
</ul>

I've been regularly drawing <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2023/12/2023-12-30-01-daily-moments-drawing/">daily moments</a> for a
while now. Now that I have a little more time for
myself, I want to think about how I can make this
even better. I think I'd like to start with <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/08/colours/">more colour</a>, especially as the cooler months approach.
(I used to struggle with the desaturated bleakness
of winter, but now I'm beginning to realize I can
add the colour myself.)
</p>

<p>
I also want to play around with <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/03/stick-figure-out-feelings/">more expressive
faces and figures</a>, and drawing more types of
things. That probably means doing a daily drawing
(or drawings) in addition to my moment of the day,
so I can play with things that might not show up
in our everyday life. I can start by focusing on
cartoony illustrations: simple lines and curves
and colours. It doesn't have to be realistic.
Fancy shading can wait.
</p>

<p>
It's okay to keep things simple with a monthly
grid. Maybe eventually I'll relax the grid and
play with different sizes. Eventually I might
start to mix in more text, like the way some
people do travel journals. I tend to write a lot
of text in my <a href="https://sketches.sachachua.com">sketches</a> by default, though.
Starting with the grid forces me to keep text to a
minimum.
</p>

<p>
Someday I'd like to be able to tell stories in
comic form, like <a href="https://drewscape.blogspot.com/">Drewscape</a> does. I can develop an
ear and an eye for stories. Much to learn.
