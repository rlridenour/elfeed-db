Apple has had yet another AI executive poached by Meta, despite reports that the social networking company is slowing hiring (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/meta-poaches-apple-ai-executive-frank-chu-even-as-it-plans-hiring-slowdown">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>

Frank Chu, one of Apple's team leaders focused on cloud infrastructure, training, and search, will join Meta's Superintelligence Labs, a division tasked with building advanced AI systems capable of performing at or beyond human-level intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Chu was involved with managing Apple's cloud-based large language models (LLMs), and was also influential in developing search features for Siri and Apple's entertainment services. For Meta, Chu will work on a new team called MSL Infra, responsible for AI infrastructure development. <br/>

Meta has spent billions of dollars on recruitment for its Superintelligence group in recent months, but the company is said to be slowing down hiring over concerns of an overheated market. The pause went into effect last week amid a broader restructuring of the group.<br/>
<br/>
Fears that investments in AI are moving too fast weren't helped by reports earlier this week that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told a group of journalists that he believes AI is in a bubble. There was a broader sell-off of U.S. technology stocks following the news.<br/>

Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/07/apples-ai-problem-not-just-siri-talent-leaving/">hemorrhaged</a> around a dozen artificial intelligence staff to rivals since January. The exodus of staff from Apple's AI team over the last seven months has seen senior researchers leave variously for Meta, OpenAI, xAI, Cohere, and others. <br/>
<br/>
One of the most notable recent departures was Ruoming Pang, head of Apple's Foundational Models team, who joined Meta last month after being lured by CEO Mark Zuckerberg with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/meta-offered-apple-ai-executive-over-200-million/">&#36;200 million pay package</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The talent drain coincides with Apple's struggle to update Siri by integrating LLMs. A chatbot-like version of the virtual assistant was one of the key Apple Intelligence features that Apple promoted at last year's WWWDC, but it has yet to arrive.<br/>

Apple is said to be considering using third-party AI models for Siri rather than its in-house technology, following an executive restructuring. During Apple's recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company is "making good progress on a more personalized Siri" that is powered by Apple Intelligence, and he reiterated that the features will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/tim-cook-shares-personalized-siri-update/">available next year</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/22/apple-loses-another-key-ai-leader-to-meta/">Apple Loses Another Key AI Leader to Meta&#039;s Superintelligence Labs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-loses-another-key-ai-leader-to-metas-superintelligence-labs.2463808/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
