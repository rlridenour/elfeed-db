<p id="p2">Today, OpenAI released <a href="https://openai.com/codex/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codex</a>, a Mac app for building software. Here’s how OpenAI describes the app in its <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  The Codex app changes how software gets built and who can build it—from pairing with a single coding agent on targeted edits to supervising coordinated teams of agents across the full lifecycle of designing, building, shipping, and maintaining software.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p4">On first launch, Codex requests permission to access the file system. I granted it access to a subfolder where I stored all my projects, along with the folder that houses an app I’ve been building in my spare time. Those folders and projects live in the left sidebar, where each can be expanded to reveal chat sessions for that project.</p>

<p id="p6">In the toolbar is an Open button for accessing other development tools installed on your Mac, a Commit button for managing version control, a button that reveals a terminal view that expands up from the bottom of the window, and a diff panel for reviewing code changes. In settings, you’ll find additional customization options, along with tools to hook up MCP servers and integrate skills.</p>

<p id="p8">Codex is not your traditional IDE. Agents are front and center, which in an app that is far more natural to use if you’re new to agentic coding, but the model is similar. While I write this article, Codex has been grinding away in the background performing a code review of my app. After spending time reviewing all the files, Codex asked permission to run commands to do things that it can’t accomplish inside its sandboxed environment.</p>

<p id="p10">The capabilities of Codex are enhanced by skills. OpenAI is kicking off the launch of Codex with a bunch of skills that you can access via its open-source <a href="https://github.com/openai/skills" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repo</a>. The app includes a selection of pre-built Automations for repetitive tasks, too.</p>
<p id="p11">All in all, Codex looks excellent, but it will take me some time to get a sense of its full capabilities. If you’re interested in trying Codex, you can download it from OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/codex/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. For a limited time, the company is making the tool available to Free and Go subscribers, for whom rate limits have been temporarily doubled, as well as Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu users.</p>
