Apple's second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> is now 1,000 days old, with no sign of a refresh or third-generation model on the horizon.<br/>

The original &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; was announced at WWDC in 2017 and launched in 2018 after a heavily delayed release. The device was met with mixed reviews; critics praised its outstanding sound quality but pointed out its high price, missing features, and limited functionality compared to rivals.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/04/apple-cuts-homepod-price-worldwide/">dropped its price</a> from &#36;349 to &#36;299 in April 2019 and, in March 2021, the company announced that it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/">discontinuing</a> the first-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, instead shifting its focus to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, which launched the previous year. The decision left a gap in Apple's product lineup for a full-sized smart speaker until the company introduced the second-generation model via a press release on January 18, 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; looks virtually identical to the original, although it is 0.2 inches shorter and has a larger edge-to-edge LED touchscreen on top. It also boasts a range of upgrades and changes compared to its 2018 predecessor, including the S7 chip, a U1 ultra wideband chip, a removable power cable, a temperature and humidity sensor, and sound recognition. However, it features two fewer microphones and horn-loaded tweeters.<br/>
<br/>
This second-generation device has now reached 1,000 days since its announcement and no successor is rumored, but at least two other &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; products are allegedly in the pipeline. One is a new &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; with a new S-series chip and Apple's new N1 Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip, and the other is an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">all-new smart home hub</a>, which has been described as a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a square iPad-like 7-inch screen and an A18 chip. Apple is widely rumored to be planning a wave of new smart home devices over the next few years, so while a third-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; doesn't seem to be on the horizon for now, a refresh or the launch of a similar product seems inevitable.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/14/homepod-2-now-1000-days-old/">HomePod 2 Now 1,000 Days Old</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-2-now-1-000-days-old.2469083/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
