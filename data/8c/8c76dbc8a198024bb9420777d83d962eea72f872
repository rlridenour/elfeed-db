<p>President Trump has issued a full pardon to former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been serving a 45-year sentence in a US prison for drug trafficking and firearms offenses linked to a large-scale cocaine operation into the United States. The pardon led to Hernández’s release from a federal facility in West Virginia and came as the Trump administration is simultaneously ordering airstrikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean as part of what it describes as a war on “narco-terrorists”. President Trump has said he acted after appeals from people in Honduras and expressed personal satisfaction with the decision, while critics in US law enforcement and analysts argue the move undermines years of anti-narcotics efforts that targeted senior officials involved in trafficking. The decision also lands at a politically sensitive moment for Honduras, where a closely fought presidential election is being counted and a US-backed candidate holds a razor-thin lead, prompting concerns among some observers about the signal Washington is sending to the region’s political class.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/CdsQp0x71898jTzNO_2u9niXvCOIPuB886ssyi9bx22l6055gzHGEnBZ3Ey3pbR3uP3yVnbO6WE7NkVwOsyzPRpyNHktM_lvW1eHHyKNXVG5UJcRwdPeMzUtz5OlveKlQHBrCj5X_RSNZXBFU-Qty1pN4DuQK-Yykhvu8Jv6bqt5vBhA6YmJgMDb_ZCubpeJOLDZFxWg8XHHK8077qeqaGujsa-aCRwfk9XQ7qdZETL4OdrV3uVI1wllaUY4l0KmeKF36VOhHTfUCmvrVBzmtDRUxBr32DjbUee7oTwRnsQ8KBKQ1x8dz4mSNKLL_I9dyDKYB3mTXgwcO5cVfF8PLVcWJ7-_CGjPATzHzxVEHw4Ma1cZveU_vil_nid255Bcpo5jupGgzZ8BuR4txJMbeokunzP4QjmY4-tKKqhNuYhGDGIuZLPuANh0kmpfGkTBdUbGEO6el8_MuIT6zlN346EOGl42XZ7Fs1-tRVzl4w' alt='Supporters and officials in Honduras follow tense election results as news of Juan Orlando Hernández’s US pardon breaks.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Hernández’s conviction: US prosecutors had described Hernández as a central figure in a long-running conspiracy that moved vast quantities of cocaine toward the United States while he was in power, leading a New York jury to convict him on drug trafficking and firearms charges and a judge to impose a multi-decade sentence in 2024.</li><li>Law enforcement reaction: A former US Drug Enforcement Administration agent said the pardon sends a message that pursuing cases against top-level officials is pointless, calling it “devastating” for investigators who spent years building the prosecution.</li><li>Honduran political backdrop: Hernández’s release coincides with a knife-edge Honduran presidential vote count in which the US-favored candidate Nasry Asfura leads by just over 500 ballots, raising regional questions about perceived US involvement in the country’s politics.</li><li>Messaging on drug policy: At the same time as granting the pardon, President Trump has framed his broader approach as a battle against “narco-terrorists” and authorized strikes on vessels in Caribbean waters suspected of moving narcotics toward US shores.</li><li>Supporters’ appeals: President Trump has said Hondurans, including figures from the country, lobbied him to free Hernández, and he has portrayed the pardon as a decision he “felt very good” about after considering their requests.</li></ul><blockquote>It means any attempt to work your investigations to the highest levels is meaningless. - Mike Vigil, former DEA chief of international operations</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: President Trump has presented the pardon as a response to appeals from Hondurans to free Hernández and has said he felt good about granting clemency after hearing their arguments.
