A cry for justice swells up <br></br>
from a people who have seen <br></br>
so little of it.
</p>

 <p>
“Yes, justice,” <br></br>
comes the reply, <br></br>
“But first, <br></br>
we must have peace. <br></br>
Peace today, <br></br>
maybe justice tomorrow.”
</p>

 <p>
But a peace without justice, <br></br>
is not the Shalom of God. <br></br>
It is a peace that serves <br></br>
the status quo, <br></br>
the interests of the powerful, <br></br>
and the coffers of the wealthy.
</p>

 <p>
The prophets tell us that <br></br>
your justice is measured <br></br>
not by its effect <br></br>
on the privileged, <br></br>
but by its effect <br></br>
on those who have <br></br>
been denied <br></br>
privilege and power.
</p>

 <p>
The day is coming when <br></br>
God’s justice will reign, <br></br>
when the low are lifted up <br></br>
and the mighty fall, <br></br>
and woe unto us <br></br>
who have stood in the way <br></br>
because of our silence.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
