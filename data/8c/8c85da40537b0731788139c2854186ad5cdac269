<p>hi everyone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently using Vim in my day to day work, and if you don&rsquo;t know I migrated from
another perfect editor called Emacs.</p>
<p>It was pretty easy to migrate since I used evil-mode in Emacs but the only library/plugin
I miss is <a href="https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump">dumb-jump</a> which is brilliant because
allows you to jump to definition without any CTAGS/GTAGS.</p>
<p>There is brilliant guy <a href="https://github.com/bounceme">Chris Paul</a> who made <code>dim-jump</code> plugin which does the same as <code>dumb-jump</code>.</p>
<p>Moreover the plugin is using <code>dumb-jump</code> rules and download them at the first usage of the plugin.</p>
<p>Just add</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Plug &#34;bounceme/dim-jump&#34;
</code></pre><p>to your <code>.vimrc</code>/<code>init.vim</code> and have fun.</p>
<p>The plugin currently just jumps to the first most relevant definition found which is not always correct for me.</p>
<p>In case you need a fixed version which shows you all possible founds add my fork to you <code>.vimrc</code>/<code>init.vim</code> file:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Plug &#39;KryDos/dim-jump&#39;, { &#39;branch&#39;: &#39;krydos-adaptation&#39; }
</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;ll update this post as soon as my changes will be accepted by Chris,
otherwise choose between these two versions of plugin depending on your needs.</p>
