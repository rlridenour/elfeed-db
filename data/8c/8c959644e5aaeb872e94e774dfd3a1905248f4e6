<p>Andrew Cunningham, writing for Ars Technica at the end of January:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple also outlines a number of usage restrictions for the
generative AI features that rely on external services. Apple says
that, “at a minimum,” users will be able to generate 50 images, 50
presentations of between 8 to 10 slides each, and to generate
presenter notes in Keynote for 700 slides. More usage may be
possible, but this depends on “the complexity of the queries,
server availability, and network availability.”</p>

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/116008952067084300">Steven Troughton-Smith</a>, last week, after creating an entire app with OpenAI’s Codex:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This entire app used 7% of my weekly Codex usage limit. Compare
that to a single (awful) slideshow in Keynote using 47% of my
monthly Apple Creator Studio usage limit 👀</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something feels off here, by at least an order of magnitude (maybe two?), that creating an entire good app costs way less than creating one shitty slide deck in Keynote. It should be the other way around.</p>
