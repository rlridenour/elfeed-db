With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a>, Apple added a new feature called Adaptive Power that joins Low Power Mode as a power management option.<br/>

Available in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s battery settings, Adaptive Power is designed to make small performance adjustments that will improve battery life. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says that some of these options include lowering display brightness or allowing some activities to "take a little longer." The feature is also designed to turn on Low Power Mode automatically when your battery hits 20 percent, depending on what you're doing.<br/>
<br/>
This appears to be the battery saving feature that was rumored ahead of the debut of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, and it will specifically help extend battery life on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> models. <br/>
<br/>
It is an opt-in feature that can be turned on all the time, allowing your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to continually manage power usage to optimize for battery life. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-adaptive-power/">iOS 26 Gets New &#039;Adaptive Power&#039; Option to Extend Battery Life</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-gets-new-adaptive-power-option-to-extend-battery-life.2458480/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
