As you all know, I&rsquo;m really enjoying Greg Newman&rsquo;s <a href="https://gregnewman.io/blog/emacs-carnival-2025-07-writing-experience/">Emacs Carnival: Writing Experience</a> blog posts by various Emacs users who do their (non-code) writing with Emacs. I&rsquo;ve commented on several of them and today I want to comment on another. This one is from Charles Choi, himself a frequent subject of Irreal posts.
</p>
<p>
Choi&rsquo;s <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/unleashing-the-editing-superpower-of-emacs.html">contribution</a> makes a point that is obvious when you see it but might not occur to you out of the box: a lot of the power of Emacs comes from its ability to deal with text structures. What does that mean?
</p>
<p>
To a first approximation, text editors deal with characters and their manipulation. You insert a character, you delete a character and maybe you copy or delete one or several characters and insert them somewhere else. The point is, you deal mostly with characters. Emacs is different. It recognizes various text structures in addition to characters. Trivial examples are words, sentences, lines, and paragraphs. A few other editors deal with some of those as well but Emacs deals with more.
</p>
<p>
For example, Emacs can deal with s-expressions, delimited structures such as quoted text or parenthetical text. The thing is, Emacs has several commands that deal specifically with these structures. That means that an Emacs user can think in terms of operating on those structures instead of just characters. That makes dealing with text easier and more efficient.

<p>
There&rsquo;s more to Choi&rsquo;s post than just this point so you should take a look at it. He mentions, for example, his <a href="https://kickingvegas.github.io/casual/EditKit.html">Casual EditKit</a> that makes some of those commands available in a Casual menu. Whether you like the idea of a menu or would rather internalize the commands, Emacs&rsquo; rich set of commands for dealing with text structures is a real win.</p>
