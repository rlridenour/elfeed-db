<p>Sotheby’s in New York sold Gustav Klimt’s Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer for $236.4 million, a figure reported by several outlets as the highest price for a work of modern art at auction and the second-highest price ever paid at auction for any painting. The portrait is notable not only for its price but for its history: it helped Elisabeth Lederer — who was Jewish — survive in Vienna during the Nazi era, a fact highlighted by multiple reports. Some outlets published a different headline number for the sale (for example, The Globe and Mail reported $332 million), reflecting alternative reporting or conversions among sources.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/G7sVZmMYDWsnQfvqHdWduFC8jRbfrdOaaTTb65U2w5XjDNOJUgV9VP_BcC_Znn-tSIPBoylOTS6IqtvDABbK-UVvijJQKpX0abRuzG1rhY-xZIOfPcV9ebBVx85gtaAjPRLEPpRT9bu0VfvBWWkJyRozFzvuCyDvcGzn1EqLFVjwN_I3U0W-zfUu6uUd6FzSRGfNZdmHJNoHGoHhE5hMacPZZ0Kb6QmlrrIVMtMa1KswDTG3KopqidJiaSvVQNV0pDsBRfHuvK3S-k2I-w' alt='Gustav Klimt&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer&quot; after its sale at Sotheby’s in New York, Nov. 18, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Bidding drama: The lot drew intense competitive bidding that lasted about 20 minutes before the hammer fell, according to coverage of the auction night.</li><li>Provenance detail: Klimt painted the portrait between 1914 and 1916 and the work was confiscated from Jewish owners during the Nazi era before later resurfacing in collections.</li><li>Market context: Analysts called the sale a rare bright spot for the high-end art market, which publications have reported is otherwise struggling with weak demand and few marquee lots.</li><li>Other headline lots: The same Sotheby’s sale included novelty and high-profile items — notably a solid‑gold functioning toilet — reported at different price points by outlets covering the auction.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Art market analysts: Observers described the Klimt sale as an unusual bright spot that contrasts with broader weakness in the high-end auction market, underscoring selective demand for headline works.
