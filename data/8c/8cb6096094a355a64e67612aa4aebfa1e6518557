<li>Magnesium glycinate, L-Theanine, L-Tryptophan, chamomile, and some superfoods &amp; adaptogens to help you sleep</li>

<li>No melatonin (that’s a good thing)</li>
<li>Exp. 10/31/26 - 3/31/27</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: Sure, why not mix some into one</li>
</ul><h1>Trypping</h1><p>Every year, around this time, we start to hear about tryptophan.</p>
<p>“That’s why you’re so tired after Thanksgiving dinner!” someone will say. “It’s the tryptophan in the turkey!”</p>
<p>Sure, that’s it. It has zero to do with eating 20,000 calories of the richest food in a single day and washing it down with some wine and/or beer, nor that countless times you have to explain to some aunt, uncle, or cousin that it’s actually copy<em>writing</em> not copy<em>righting</em>, all of which is sandwiched between two of the most hectic travel days you’ll experience in your life.</p>
<p>It’s all the tryptophan that’s to blame.</p>
<p>Of course, we’re being a bit facetious here. Both things can be true: Thanksgiving is exhausting regardless of what you eat, <em>and</em> tryptophan makes you sleepy.</p>
<p>Now, do you know how much turkey you’d need to eat to match the 500 milligrams of l-tryptophan in each serving of this Moonbrew stuff?</p>
<p>A bit over a POUND!</p>
<p>We learned that from an “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DC9kCG2x_gv/?img_index=1">ingredient spotlight</a>” Moonbrew posted to their Instagram page.</p>
<p>And, while you’re over there, maybe take a look around. Not that we’re encouraging you to get to know Moonbrew as a brand, because, after all, we’re not exactly in the business of promising to bring stuff back. In fact, the reason I encourage you to explore their Insta is because it will shed some light on how we have this stuff for this price and why it’s fleeting.</p>
<p>You’ll notice the packaging you see here and the packaging you see there differ slightly.</p>
<p>That’s how we got such a good deal: Moonbrew did a design overhaul, allowing us to buy up the stuff with the old look for cheap. Which we just love, honestly. Because this old packaging? It doesn’t even look stupid or anything! So you get the same great stuff for way less because of a font change.</p>
<p>Which all leads us to the inevitable question: How do you know this is ‘great stuff’? As in: how can you be sure a dissolvable sweet drink with some magnesium, tryptophan, chamomile, and other stuff will actually help you sleep? <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MoonBrew-Nighttime-Magnesium-Natural-Adults/dp/B0DNRPSQGC?th=1&tag=mehdown-20">People certainly like it over on the Amazon</a>, where a single bag of this stuff costs about 48 bucks. But that doesn’t really prove anything.</p>
<p>So, to answer the question of whether it really works: maybe not. But also, maybe yes?</p>
<p>And, at $10 per bag, it couldn’t hurt to try, right?</p>
<p>(And if you get some, do let us know what you think in the comments.)</p>
