<p>There are a few &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; things that can happen during Thanksgiving. One of those, apparently, is to talk to your brother-in-law, who happens to be a sound engineer, about (yet again) thinking about learning to play a musical instrument.</p>
<p>This wasn’t my first time considering learning to play. I’ve been deep in an electronic music binge for the last couple of weeks (I’ve always loved it, but this time I think I went overboard), and my on-again-off-again fling with classical music is back - currently I&rsquo;m listening through my headphones as I type. So, fueled by good food and too many drinks, I explained to my enabler, who was sitting across from me with dangerous interest in his eyes, that what I actually want to learn is making electronic music. When you talk to someone who professionally tweaks soundboards and used to be (or is?) in a band, you get a solid recommendation and a solid price tag.</p>
<p>Money was the only thing standing between me and musical mediocrity—until two days later, when the <a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/inflation-refund-checks.htm">NY State inflation refund check</a> arrived. My partner held it up with a smirk: &ldquo;Congrats. You’re officially screwed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A week later, my Roland GO:KEYS was waiting at my doorstep.</p>
<p>I stopped feeling overwhelmed three days ago—after mounting it on a stand and accepting that &ldquo;playing music&rdquo; for me means labeling keys with labels I usually use to name USB cables. My curriculum consists of YouTube tutorials on musical notation and Wikipedia deep dives into <a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/893/why-is-c-the-base-note-of-standard-notation-and-keys">why “C” is the default key in Western music</a>. (Spoiler: It’s the only major scale with no sharps or flats, making it the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/awewl4/why_is_c_major_the_default_key_for_teaching_music/">Hello, World!” of music</a>. Add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_of_Arezzo">a medieval monk</a> to the mix who reinvented music teaching after the music of the time, and well&hellip; I did say it was a deep dive, didn&rsquo;t I?)</p>
<p>Anyway, here it is:</p>

A barbell under one of the beams, and a subpar AI cleaning technique can be seen on the carpet at the bottom right, where JTR removed his used socks from the frame. Tsk tsk.">
<p>So far, I’ve mastered Twinkle Twinkle Little Star (my musical ABCs, as you can see from the labels) and reconstructed an old Jewish lullaby from childhood.</p>
<p>If my photography hobby taught me anything, it’s this: Go slow, laugh at your mistakes, and ignore anyone who says you &ldquo;should’ve started younger.&rdquo; (which I kind of did by the way, and it was horribly boring then).</p>
