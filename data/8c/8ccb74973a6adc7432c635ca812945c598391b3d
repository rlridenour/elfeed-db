<p>East meets&nbsp;West, and the Ancient, the Modern. That’s what happens every time Luna Lee plays one of your favorites on the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayageum">Gayageum</a>, a Korean instrument that dates back to the 6th century. We’ve featured her work in years past (see the Relateds below). Above, watch one of her standout performances—a cover of “The Man Who Sold The World,” the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSH--SJKVQQ">first written by David Bowie in 1970</a>, then famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fregObNcHC8">performed&nbsp;by Nirvana on <em>MTV</em>&nbsp;<em>Unplugged</em> in 1993</a>. An&nbsp;alternate video&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgPo9fam3L4">features Luna on vocals here</a>. Enjoy!</p>
