<p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe traveled to Caracas on Thursday for a roughly two-hour meeting with Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, in the highest-level U.S. visit since Nicolás Maduro’s removal and seizure in a U.S. military operation about two weeks earlier. The Trump administration said President Trump directed the trip to deliver a message that Washington wants an improved working relationship with Caracas, with talks touching on security and cooperation. The visit signals an attempt to keep communications open as Venezuela’s leadership shifts, though it has also prompted criticism from the opposition, who argue the interim government lacks independence.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ZwlJ2b72OJn6Vt43Ch_yuM2PuJV_nbBC8ZV4GY4q0ktNWlM-T4Z8vfJWEvKb6axCS5htUX03C1uiB64TpYzdEKt21WIP0Sy0uhBfDcuz2VpQhsIh7Hbi6MMdl2KIAFE-lUsFLhzL71eyHk1UcETO9mkdjfXIGmLFJbbVPgOySvqX0BOSbdlN47c' alt='John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, at the U.S. Capitol last week.
