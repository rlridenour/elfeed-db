<p>President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency related to Cuba and directed steps that could impose tariffs on goods from countries that provide oil to the island, a move framed as tightening the long-running US embargo on Havana. The policy aims to squeeze Cuba’s fuel supply at a moment when shortages are already contributing to extended power blackouts and higher costs for essentials, according to reporting from the island. Cuba’s government condemned the move as an attempt to “suffocate” its economy, while Russia’s Foreign Ministry criticized what it called unilateral coercive measures outside the UN framework. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum warned the tariff threat could worsen humanitarian conditions and said Mexico would pursue diplomatic channels and solidarity with Cuba.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/pcQzeYMi5_fNqqTrrrEpmw0Bbn5-AJDgcwwEDLTe0a0RFH965edSwTZYPKDdYu2ITtz9PVuAaWWgCtQHL10HO-scthL3Ox9YB9-81Ug1mV2K2M_2zhsAyClZL3lGDjPEVbU-yT14rl9zNDyHu7Tyljax-e6p8KtDh0v2skBw1h1a4i7uMLqlAd9AvjM8nXQ' alt='A representational image illustrating fuel and energy pressures affecting Cuba.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Embargo history: The new tariff threat is presented as a way to reinforce an embargo on Cuba that dates back to the 1960s.</li><li>Cuban hardship: Firstpost described residents adapting with “survival mode” measures amid soaring prices for food, fuel and transport alongside lengthening blackouts.</li><li>Havana response: Cuba declared an “international emergency” and said the US pressure campaign posed an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” linking it to what it called the “US anti-Cuban neo-fascist right wing”.</li><li>Trump comments: As the dispute escalated, President Trump suggested Cuba could collapse “pretty soon,” according to RT’s account.</li></ul><blockquote>What we see is yet another radical recurrence of Washington’s strategy of maximum pressure on the Island of Freedom, aimed at its economic suffocation, - Maria Zakharova</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States (Trump administration): The White House declared a national emergency tied to Cuba and laid groundwork for tariffs on countries that supply oil to the island.
