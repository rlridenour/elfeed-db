<p>Britain’s Prince Andrew said on Friday he will stop using his Duke of York title and other honors, with a statement via Buckingham Palace citing a desire to avoid “distractions” from the work of King Charles III and the royal family while he continues to deny the accusations against him [reuters.com#1][france24.com#2][dw.com#1]. The announcement follows renewed scrutiny triggered by media excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, whose allegations have resurfaced in recent days [politico.eu#1][france24.com#2][cbsnews.com#2]. Andrew had already stepped back from public duties and, in 2022, lost most titles and settled a U.S. civil case linked to Jeffrey Epstein without admitting liability, while maintaining his denials [reuters.com#1][nytimes.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/N57LwsUPo3UsWS9aXLfmPIxdXMRyIbiMzkdddvWSl3V5Gq_uzEi0QnNFUDuZ4G1kiaWPiTQRSLiGWN5i1sp5eXB2OFAmWJV7u3wJFhe6xpDsz9RTfuP98kjANz_ip2BJIIQE9DgPln8jlyQLyGvYAxJ3uHRhTOWGR60_1CJG2h8WL41XSgbht5kaRifxPx2GcOD4TOLj12MPhw2dKDiyg_oUjLvpB6sx9cmlxmCdYhZTFhUQXCPsezXzl9kQRjNKsJfVVQ1cRyorY_TKAg' alt='Prince Andrew in Sandringham, Norfolk, England, in 2022.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Specific honours: He will no longer use his GCVO and Order of the Garter honours; his only remaining title is prince, which cannot be removed [theguardian.com#1].</li><li>Consultation noted: The decision followed a discussion with King Charles and the wider family, according to the statement [theguardian.com#1][politico.eu#1].</li><li>Accuser family reaction: A brother of Virginia Giuffre called the move &quot;a joyous moment,&quot; with the family expressing mixed emotions, while others also welcomed the renunciation [bbc.com#1][straitstimes.com#1].</li><li>Royal succession: Andrew is 65 years old and eighth in line to the British throne [reuters.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>I will therefore no longer use the title or the honours which have been conferred upon me.
