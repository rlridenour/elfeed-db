<p>Aphorisms from Norman Macdonald&#8217;s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=iQkOAAAAYAAJ"><em>Maxims and Moral Reflections</em></a>, 1827:</p>
<ul>
<li>By speaking contemptibly of our enemies, we disgrace our own hostility.</li>
<li>We would be successful in most enterprises of life, were we to take that advice to ourselves which we give to others in similar circumstances.</li>
<li>Severity of punishment deters minor crimes, but renders greater ones more certain and determined.</li>
<li>Pride, like love, is sure to discover itself; because it can only derive value from the success with which it affects others.</li>
<li>Were there no fools there would be no flatterers.</li>
<li>The less we know of ourselves, the worse qualified we are to judge correctly of others.</li>
<li>No end can be honorable that is dishonorably obtained.</li>
<li>The better a man is known to himself, the more easily he is understood by others.</li>
<li>There are two sorts of people that are never contented: they that do not know what they desire, and they that attempt impossibilities.</li>
<li>The failure of many designs is owing to a confidence of success.</li>
<li>A sure way, sometimes, to expose our virtue, is to endeavor to conceal it.</li>
<li>A man is more deserving of success, that claims not adulation as his first conquest.</li>
<li>We advise others better than ourselves.</li>
<li>Most men have two principles, one practical, another professional.</li>
<li>In cunning, our pride oftener dreads disappointment than our interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Most men know how to take offence; but few know how to forgive &#8212; pride is always impatient; magnanimity, tolerant and pacific.&#8221;</p>
