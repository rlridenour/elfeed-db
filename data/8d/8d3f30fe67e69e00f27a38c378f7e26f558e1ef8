In response to my <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12984">post on the best emacs keyboards</a>, Paul Jorgensen has <a href="https://plrj.org/2025/05/13/my-emacs-keyboard/">a very interesting post</a> of how he leverages software to turn the standard Apple keyboards into Emacs specific keyboards and make them better suited to his needs outside of Emacs as well.

Oddly, he doesn&rsquo;t have RSI problems so his changes are simply for keyboard efficiency. His post is interesting because it shows how far you can get with a standard, builtin keyboard through software.

<p>
Jorgensen uses a combination of Emacs configuration and <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/">Karabiner-Elements</a> to customize his keyboard layout. It&rsquo;s nowhere near what I&rsquo;d want but that&rsquo;s not the point. You can use his strategy to configure your keyboard to your requirements.
</p>
<p>
The lesson from all this is that you don&rsquo;t (necessarily) need a special keyboard to make it amenable to Emacs or whatever else you&rsquo;re using. Happily, I don&rsquo;t require much more than mapping <kbd>caps lock</kbd> to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, choosing a key for <kbd>Hyper</kbd>, and choosing a key for <kbd>Super</kbd>. All that&rsquo;s easily done from within Emacs and standard macOS.
</p>
<p>
All of this is significant because although there are now plenty of excellent third party keyboards available, many—or most—of us are using laptops as our main computers and often don&rsquo;t have the option of using third party keyboards. Being able to use software to reconfigure our standard keyboards to our liking is a huge win.

If this sort of thing interests you, take a look at Jorgensen&rsquo;s post. As I said, you don&rsquo;t have to make the same choices that he did. His process will allow you to make just about any configuration possible.</p>
