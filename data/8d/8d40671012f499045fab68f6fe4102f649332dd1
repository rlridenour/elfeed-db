<p>Last week, on the 6th of November, I decided to spend my lunch break looking at beautiful art rather than grimly eating my lunch at my desk. It is something I have been meaning to do for a while, and on that particular day, it was probably the best thing I could have done.</p>
<p>I am incredibly lucky to have an art gallery practically on my doorstep at work: <a href="https://barber.org.uk">The Barber Institute of Fine Arts</a> (known as &lsquo;The Barber&rsquo; for short). It is a small but perfectly formed gallery, with regular, thought-provoking exhibitions, and a good core of works in the collection. It also generally has free admission for anyone (not just University staff and students). I haven&rsquo;t visited for a while, but had been meaning to visit after hearing about the current exhibition: <a href="https://barber.org.uk/scent-and-pre-raphaelites/">Scent and the Art of the Pre-Raphaelites</a>. I am fond of the work of the Pre-Raphaelites, but the exhibition also had specially-created scents to pair with some of the paintings, which intrigued me. It is both an exploration of the evocation of scent in visual art, and of synaesthesia which the Victorians were interested in.</p>
<p>I said that I am fond of the work of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, but it is hard to be fond of some of the artists themselves. They were of their time of course (the mid-19th Century), but many of the Brotherhood and those associated with the movement treated women badly, and their work is sometimes patronising, moralistic, overly sentimental or perpetuates harmful stereotypes. However, I believe that you can love the art without liking (or agreeing with) the artist. And I do love a lot of their art. What draws me in every time is the colour, intensity and detail. They are often paintings that you can bask in. I&rsquo;m going to try to describe from memory the painting that resonated most with me on this visit (coincidentally also on the posters for the exhibition), which is &lsquo;The Blind Girl&rsquo; by John Everett Millais. This is obviously a doomed enterprise. While a picture may be able to paint a thousand words, trying to do the reverse is exceptionally tricky. Even a (visual) digital reproduction of a painting does not compare with the experience of seeing the real artwork in front of you, with your own eyes. However, I was inspired by the curator&rsquo;s attempt to capture a visual experience in scent which is an even more difficult task, so here goes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Blind Girl&rsquo; &mdash; as the title suggests &mdash; depicts a young blind woman sitting on the bank of a small stream, with a younger girl (perhaps her little sister?) sitting next to her and leaning against her. I think we are supposed to pity this blind girl, indeed there is a piece of paper pinned to her blouse at her neck with those very words written on it: &ldquo;Pity the Blind&rdquo;. She has a small accordion in her lap, and her clothes and those of the younger girl are well worn, with patches and small, frayed rips. Their hems are spotted with mud. It looks like they have been travelling by foot, perhaps asking for money along the way in return for a tune on the accordion.</p>
<p>However, to me, this girl looks like a queen. She literally shines in the sun. Copper, gold and rose tones make it impossible to look away from her. There is an air of weariness about her, but she seems completely at peace and at one with the environment around her. Her skirt is a saturated golden ochre, the shawl draped over her head and shoulders is a rich rust red, and her hair is a shining, glorious copper, reflecting the sunlight. Her face is turned towards the sun and tilted up, her eyes closed. Her right hand is buried in the soft meadow grass of the river bank, while her left is clasping the warm hand of the younger girl. She is so still that a tortoiseshell butterfly rests on her shawl, wings open, also basking in the warmth of the sun.</p>
<p>The younger girl is wearing a dark jacket and an ink blue dress which has tones of purple and indigo in the sun. It picks up the plumage of the rooks and carrion crows foraging in the grass behind them, the way that crows&rsquo; feathers can flash electric blue when seen at dawn and dusk. Her hair is bright gold, contrasting with the copper of her sister&rsquo;s hair. She is cuddled into the side of the young woman, and in the process of drawing the rust red shawl around her face as she looks towards the background of the painting. The information in the exhibition suggested that she might be smelling the comforting smell of the shawl, which makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Behind these two, a field stretches uphill towards a settlement. The area immediately behind them is busy with rooks and crows, rasping and cackling to one another as they swish among the grasses probing for food. Behind them, cattle, sheep and a donkey graze, and at the top of the hill, we can see buildings above the trees and hedges. At the very top of the painting, we see why the light is so golden. The sky is a deep blue-black and a double rainbow shines against it. The outer, fainter rainbow is nearest the blind woman&rsquo;s head, and the brigher one nearest her sister. I wonder if that was a deliberate comment on her lack of sight?</p>
<p>She may lack sight, but I have rarely seen the subject of a painting seem so rich in sensory experience, or so <em>in the moment</em> of her experience. In that moment of <em>my</em> experience, I really needed to be transported somewhere else (anywhere else), and I was. Standing with the painting almost filling my field of view, I felt that I could experience what she was experiencing. I could feel the warmth of the sun on my face, the touch of soft grasses and a warm hand, the silvery sound of the little stream dancing around pebbles, and the welcome kiss of coolness on the skin from water vapour in the air that is so welcome beside a stream in the warm sun. Perhaps too the sharp scent of human sweat from their walking and the toasty, yeasty smell of wet woollen clothing. I could hear the rooks&rsquo; chatter bounce around the field and the more distant sounds of human life in the village above. Of course, the air would probably have been filled with bird song and the drone of insects, a dome of sound, but I push this thought away to a safe distance as it brings on eco-grief for a lost world. Most of all, I could smell that electric, fleeting petrichor scent that you get after a shower, while the sun warms the soil.</p>
<p>What a lovely moment. It has stayed with me too. In moments of despondency, I have closed my eyes and time-travelled into the moment that this painting has caught and preserved like an insect in amber.</p>
