<p>Bulgaria’s President Rumen Radev said he will step down from the largely ceremonial post, with his resignation set to take effect on January 20. The move comes as Bulgaria heads toward another snap parliamentary election within the next three months, after the government resigned last month amid a prolonged political crisis. Radev’s decision has fueled expectations that he will enter party politics and seek executive power in the upcoming vote.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/0Rz2Rw9v4SoLgEHBZ65TBM6cvX8QnqkIQZHHXouqsuo5v2xt63s_tk36Nk64H_RHyTvGQyKspSFmCoNKoiaGRQbKLrjnNEvNV5_XWtFfflIrqgdEqd_wCYWzxZ6EgCjK0CHQOtIYt9dUf-1RCsy7CXltunSeYT9Km24NiF93Rs1YpAIjNA7KjZniYm8IXAqKM8-KEz-ZZtqiEz_FI2in0JZSQE0' alt='Bulgarian President Rumen Radev photographed in Sofia during political developments leading into snap elections.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Historic resignation: Radev’s departure is described as the first resignation by a Bulgarian head of state in the country’s post-communist period.</li><li>Election frequency: The next vote will be Bulgaria’s eighth parliamentary election in five years, underscoring how difficult it has been to form durable governing coalitions.</li><li>Party speculation: Multiple outlets report widespread speculation that Radev plans to create a new political party before the snap election campaign begins.</li><li>Prime minister bid: Euronews reports Radev is positioning himself to pursue the prime minister’s job, a shift that could reconfigure Bulgaria’s domestic agenda.</li><li>Foreign policy stakes: Euronews notes that a Radev-led party could also influence Bulgaria’s direction abroad, a notable point for an EU and NATO member navigating regional pressures.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Rumen Radev: Radev framed his decision as stepping down ahead of the snap election, amid expectations he may seek a stronger governing mandate through party politics.
