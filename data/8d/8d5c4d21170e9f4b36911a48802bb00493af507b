<p>In my previous post I&rsquo;ve been talking about Doom config and that it is great and all but
I find it really difficult to fix issues there.
Doom has a lot of its own configuration, hooks here and there and functions that modifies standard behavior.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably much easier to go with my own config. I never could stick to spacemacs or doom. I couldn&rsquo;t stick to similar configs in Vim too.
Probably issue on my end :)</p>
<p>Also Doom&rsquo;s evil mode feels so verbose. It definitely feels more verbose than Vim itself. It feels like I have to press
much more keys to tell emacs to do something.</p>
<p>At the moment I&rsquo;m on my own config WITHOUT evil-mode and interesting to note, my muscle memory switched to Emacs-mode in ~30 minutes.
I didn&rsquo;t expect that. For most of the actions there is no a &ldquo;thinking process&rdquo;. They just happen.
Last time I used Emacs was couple of years ago and I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s keybindings went that deep in my muscle memory.</p>
<p>Maybe, which is strange for me to admit, the keybinding design in Emacs is a feature&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway here is some highlight of my config:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI is standard-minimal. No toolbar, no scroll-bar, no bells. Automatically start maximized</li>
<li>MacOS&rsquo; CMD key is bound to <code>meta</code></li>
<li>Trailing spaces are deleted with <code>delete-trailing-whitespace</code> on every buffer save</li>
<li>Indent with spaces by default</li>
<li>Vertico for vertical completion (like helm or ivy)</li>
<li>Consult for some nice functions like <code>consult-imenu</code> or <code>consult-buffer</code></li>
<li>Orderless for fuzzy-like autocompletion</li>
<li>Projectile</li>
<li>Magit</li>
<li>Flycheck</li>
<li>Company</li>
<li>Vterm - possibly the greatest terminal emulation in Emacs I could fine</li>
<li>Prodigy - love this tool. Allows you to manage services running on your machine.</li>
<li>various lang modes</li>
</ul>
<p>What&rsquo;s pretty interesting and I couldn&rsquo;t expect I&rsquo;d like is a white color scheme.</p>
<p>All of those are working pretty well and if I need to override some of their behavior
it usually something super simple, unlike Doom or Spacemacs where some functionality overridden by the &ldquo;package&rdquo; configuration that you gotta
go and inspect and then find some hooks that also adds additional layer of configuration.</p>
