</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A #poem of #winter reflection, of painting a ceiling not in white but in a bold color, and a mind thus adrift.
</p>
        <p class="verse">
I sit and ponder this canopy of evergreen,<br />
Painted the long year prior;<br />
Bringing a sense of summer amongst the trees,<br />
Even in this stick white winter<br />
amidst the perma-cloud,<br />
Muting all color, joy, and—dare I say—hope.<br />
<br />
Inverness, the green so named.<br />
<br />
Echoing<br />
<br />
That city atop the British isles.<br />
A place I’ve never been, save for<br />
a neighboring Shepherd’s tale;<br />
One of dancing amongst mountains,<br />
alive and free.<br />
<br />
Yet I am rooted here, and travel seems so distant<br />
In this wintry discontent.<br />
When brother stands vigil over encroaching ice.<br />
And I call to those who will not listen.<br />
<br />
Here, amidst this canopy,<br />
tree that I am; Witness<br />
to a forest fell-tide. Unmoving,<br />
yet not unfeeling, waiting for:<br />
<br />
an axe to fall,<br />
a wedge to split,<br />
a fire to lick.<br />
<br />
Knowing a paralytic dread as winter grinds on,<br />
<br />
biting,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;clawing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raging.<br />
<br />
The loon heralds a coming spring when:<br />
<br />
Ice will melt,<br />
Buds will burst,<br />
Leaves will unfurl,<br />
<br />
And life anew shall begin again,<br />
as hope arriving; a gentle morning glow,<br />
Bathing this room of mine,<br />
Where I sit each day,<br />
And ponder.<br />
