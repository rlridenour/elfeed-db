<p>Israel says it will terminate Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders, MSF) operations in Gaza and require the organization to leave by February 28, citing MSF’s failure to provide a list of Palestinian staff as required for humanitarian groups operating there. Israeli officials also point to allegations that two MSF employees had links to Hamas and Islamic Jihad—claims MSF has denied. MSF says it did not hand over names because it could not obtain concrete assurances from Israeli authorities that staff information would be used only for administrative purposes and would not put colleagues at risk. The decision raises immediate questions about how medical services in Gaza will be sustained and whether other aid groups can fill gaps, as MSF has been a key provider of care in the enclave.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/J12lKVze1lBXVbHABouHfqUt_S_9LhELGuMSAVg7yH8xXYgZIlgehNe4TNieYX_XBGF-X_QyfRP-keQaetpL1ZfK3yqM-43_VoEK8J53BHps' alt='A Palestinian woman helps a burn victim, Maria Abu Aawad, at a Doctors Without Borders (MSF) hospital, in Zawaida, in the central Gaza Strip, January 26.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Wider NGO list: Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism previously said it would bar 37 aid organizations, including MSF, from operating in Gaza from March 1 if they did not submit detailed information about Palestinian staff.</li><li>Broken engagement: MSF says it spent months trying to engage Israeli authorities on safeguards for staff-data sharing but could not secure the specific guarantees it sought.</li><li>Registration dispute: Israeli authorities say MSF pledged in early January to share the list as part of a “binding protocol,” then did not provide it and later said it would not proceed with the registration process.</li><li>Clinical stakes: British-Palestinian surgeon Ghassan Abu Sittah, who has worked with MSF in Gaza, said ending MSF operations would be devastating for patients and would further damage Gaza’s health system.</li></ul><blockquote>Israeli authorities are forcing humanitarian organisations into an impossible choice between exposing staff to risk or interrupting critical medical care for people in desperate need - Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism: The ministry says staff lists are a standard requirement for all humanitarian organizations operating in Gaza, and it is ending MSF’s activities because MSF did not submit the Palestinian employee information it requested; it also cites allegations about links by two MSF employees to Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
