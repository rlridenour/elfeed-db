The official WhatsApp account on X today <a href="https://x.com/WhatsApp/status/1927047493797192070">reacted</a> with an eyes emoji to a post saying that WhatsApp should release an iPad app. This could be a hint that Meta is gearing up to release WhatsApp for iPad, which has already been available for beta testing via TestFlight for nearly two years. File this news under "finally."<br/>
<br/>
With an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/instagram-ipad-app/">Instagram app for the iPad</a> also reportedly in the works, it appears that Meta is at last embracing the iPad for more of its most popular apps.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to WhatsApp and Instagram, Meta owns Facebook and Threads. There is an iPad app for Facebook, but the Threads app remains iPhone only.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/26/whatsapp-teases-ipad-app/">WhatsApp Teases Long-Awaited iPad App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-teases-long-awaited-ipad-app.2457726/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
