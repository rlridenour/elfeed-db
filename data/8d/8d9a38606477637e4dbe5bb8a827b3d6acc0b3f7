Long story short, I came up with an idea to emphasize content while I was reviewing an org-mode document a few months ago after I was tired of typing tedious <code class="verbatim">*</code> around the content repeatedly. And I&#39;ve been longing for this feature since then, because I was unfamiliar with mouse-based key bindings, and neither did I have the time to investigate it.</p>

Today I finally nailed it down while I was attending a boring meeting, and it turned out to be quite simple. The exploration journey was not much different than before. First, I managed to find out how to bind a command to a mouse event, taking advantage of the good-old <code class="verbatim">C-h k</code> and <code class="verbatim">(info &#34;emacs&#34;)</code> (or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Mouse-Buttons.html">here at gnu.org</a>). And then wrote a few lines of code to perform the task standing on the shoulder of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">Advice</a>.</p>
