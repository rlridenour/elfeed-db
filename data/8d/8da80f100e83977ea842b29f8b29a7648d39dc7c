<blockquote>
  <p>I came to Minneapolis to report on what’s going on, and one of the
main questions I showed up with is “just what is the scale of the
resistance?” After all, we’re all used to the news calling
Portland a “war zone” or whatever when it’s just some protests in
one part of town. [...]</p>

<p>Half the street corners around here have people — from every walk
of life, including republicans — standing guard to watch for
suspicious vehicles, which are reported to a robust and entirely
decentralized network that tracks ICE vehicles and mobilizes
responders.</p>

<p>I have been actively involved in protest movements for 24 years. I
have never seen anything approaching this scale. Minneapolis is
not accepting what’s happening here. ICE fucking murdered a woman
for participating in this, and all that did is bring out more
people, from more walks of life.</p>

<p>It’s genuinely a leaderless (or leaderful) movement, decentralized
in a way that the state is absolutely unequipped to handle. There
are a few basic skills involved, and so people teach each other
those skills, and people are collectively refining them.</p>

<p>Apple’s “<em>whatever you say, boss</em>” compliance with the Trump administration’s “demand” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/10/iceblock_removed_from_app_store">back in October</a> that they remove <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/iceblock">ICEBlock</a> from the App Store — with no legal basis, nor <em>any</em> evidence backing the administration’s claims that the app was being used to put members of the ICE goon squads in danger — is looking more and more like a decision on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/14/politics/minneapolis-ice-shooting-polls-takeaways">the wrong side of popular opinion</a>. And, ultimately, on the wrong side of history.</p>

<p>ICEBlock was designed for exactly what these protestors are doing.</p>
