Apple is preparing to bring support for its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118271">digital car key feature</a> to Jetour vehicles, according to evidence uncovered on Apple's backend by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris.<br/>

Introduced in 2022, Car Keys allows an iPhone or Apple Watch to unlock a vehicle through the Wallet app. A digital version of a car key is stored in Wallet, and unlocking can be done by holding an Apple Watch or ‌iPhone‌ near a compatible vehicle's NFC reader.<br/>
<br/>
A tap on the door handle is enough to initiate an unlock, and while Face ID authentication is a security option, Apple offers an Express Mode that eliminates the need to authenticate for a faster unlocking process.<br/>
<br/>
Car manufacturers like BMW, Rivian, Kia, Audi, and Hyundai have all implemented support for ‌Car Keys‌ since it was introduced. During its WWDC 2025 keynote in June, Apple said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/03/iphone-car-keys-to-expand/">13 additional vehicle brands</a> would "soon" offer iPhone car keys. Chinese carmaker <a href="https://jetourglobal.com">Jetour</a>, which mainly produces crossovers and SUVs, is a subsidiary of Chery – one of the brands Apple listed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple maintains a full list of vehicles that support ‌Car Keys‌ on its <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/">CarPlay model availability webpage</a>, but it has not been updated in a while, so it is missing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/06/iphone-car-key-vehicles-list/">several recent additions</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/carkey/">iPhone Car Keys</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/jetour-vehicles-gaining-iphone-car-keys-support/">Another Vehicle Brand Gaining iPhone Car Keys Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/another-vehicle-brand-gaining-iphone-car-keys-support.2469973/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
