<blockquote>
  <p>But save for some theaters in Republican-heavy states, the film is
unlikely to leave much of an impact at a slumping box office, with
theatrical sources telling TheWrap that “Melania” is projected for
an opening of around $3 million this weekend.</p>

<p>That would put it below the last right-wing documentary, the Daily
Wire-produced Matt Walsh film “Am I Racist?,” which opened to $4.5
million from 1,517 locations in September 2024, finishing with a
$12.3 million total that made it the highest-grossing doc that
year. The highest projections are coming from NRG with an estimate
of around $5 million, though audience interest polls from the
company have 30% saying they are “definitely not” interested in
watching the film, an unusually high count for any wide release.</p>

<p>These projections are <em>with</em> a $35 million promotional campaign, for a movie Amazon paid $40 million to purchase. (<a href="https://politicalwire.com/2026/01/29/critics-question-marketing-splash-for-melania/">Via Taegan Goddard</a>.)</p>
