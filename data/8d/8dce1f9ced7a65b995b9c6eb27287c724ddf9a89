<p>Ryan Christoffel, reporting for 9to5Mac a month ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meta has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1789649698300122/?helpref=uf_share">published a support doc</a> that states its Messenger app for
Mac is being discontinued. New users won’t be able to download the
app at all, and existing users have about 60 more days of use
before it stops working altogether. Why the change? Unfortunately,
no reason has been given. But users are being pushed to the
Facebook website for all their Messenger needs instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a nearly identical support document <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/804132271957789">for the native Messenger app for Windows</a> too. They’re not even replacing them with web-app wrappers, like they <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/11/meta_whatsapp_windows_shitty_web_app">just did with the Windows WhatsApp client</a>. Just telling users to use the website.</p>
