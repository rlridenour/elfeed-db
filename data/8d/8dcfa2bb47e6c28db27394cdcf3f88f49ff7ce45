mostly monochromatic in many contexts. Styles involve the careful use
of typography, such as italics and bold italics.</p>

<p>If you want maximalist themes in terms of colour, check my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code>
package. For something in-between, which I would consider the best
“default theme” for a text editor, opt for my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code>.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Version 0.6.0 on 2026-01-17</h2>

<p>This version adds support for more packages, while it revises some of
the faces that were already covered.</p>

<h3>Enhanced completion interface</h3>

<p>The minibuffer prompt used by the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doric-themes-select</code> now
groups themes by their light or dark type. The current theme is at the
top.</p>

<h3>Avy highlights are easier to spot</h3>

<p>The highlights generated by the various commands of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">avy</code> package
now have a slightly more intense background+foreground colour combination.
It should be easier to spot and to differentiate from other highlights
such as that of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hl-line-mode</code> and the mouse hover effect over links.</p>

<h3>Support for all the tmr faces</h3>

<p>My <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmr</code> package styles timers in its grid/tabulated interface as well
as on the mode line. All these now get colours that come directly from
the active Doric theme. Before, the colours were defined only in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmr</code> source code: they were “okay” (because they are based on my
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code>) but not stylistically optimal.</p>

<h3>Support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruler-mode</code></h3>

<p>The built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruler-mode</code> draws a ruler at the top of the current
buffer. All of its faces now use appropriate colours.</p>

<h3>Trailing spaces have a more refined colour</h3>

<p>All packages that have a face that is about highlighting trailing
spaces now get a red colour value that is more appropriate for each
Doric theme.</p>

<h3>SHR buffers can use proportionately spaced fonts</h3>

<p>I removed an override for the built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shr-text</code> face, which was
making the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nov</code> package display its buffers in a monospaced font.</p>

<p>Thanks to Marcus Kammer for telling that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nov-mode</code> buffers were not
proportionately spaced by default. This was done in issue 23:
