<p>I&rsquo;m not on many social media platforms these days. I like it like that. I mostly follow some academics and people who post interesting stuff. I post only occasionally, usually to show off my recent hiking exploits. I&rsquo;ve come up with some rules for myself (all subject to change) about what I post.</p>
<p>A post must meet all the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It must be positive and uplifting.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s enough that&rsquo;s negative on the internet. Don&rsquo;t add to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It must be interesting</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bad judge of this sometimes; I don&rsquo;t want to be that schmuck who&rsquo;s posting drivel for the sake of posting. Sorry if that happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No politics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make a few exceptions here and there, but as a general rule I don&rsquo;t like posting about politics. I do follow some people that I find interesting for political reasons; that expressly does <em>not</em> mean that I agree with all or any of their views. I will post mostly about technology, academics, jokes, and hiking.</p>
<p>Why no politics? I try to keep my views nuanced. It is fantastically difficult to convey any degree of nuance in a tweet or two. If I do have something I feel strongly about, I&rsquo;ll post about it in my <a href="https://lambdaland.org/personal">personal</a> section of my blog so I can write something in long-form, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I won&rsquo;t post often, but when I do, I&rsquo;ll try to make sure it meets a high bar of quality. I&rsquo;m not out to get more followers or anything—I have just had some really good interactions online, and I want to filter for that. Fighting trolls can be fun, but is ultimately unproductive and uninteresting.</p>
