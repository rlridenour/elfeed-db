  <p>Okay, now you’re getting upset. You’re getting upset despite the
fact that we have strict rules against getting upset at this Hertz
location. But tell me, honestly, when you reserved a rental car
through Hertz, you thought… what? That we were going to set aside
a special little car just for you? Seriously? Oh my god.</p>
