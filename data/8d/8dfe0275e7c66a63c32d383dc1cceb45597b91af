The designer who introduced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> at Apple's September event left the company, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-17/the-apple-designer-who-introduced-the-iphone-air-leaves-the-company">Bloomberg</a></em>. Abidur Chowdhury recently departed Apple to join an AI startup, a move that apparently "made waves" internally because he was a rising star on the design team.<br/>

Chowdhury worked on the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;, and he described its feature set in a two-minute presentation in September. His departure was not related to the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; or the disappointing sales of the device.<br/>
<br/>
Chowdhury joined Apple's industrial design team in 2019, the same year that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/27/jony-ive-leaving-apple/">Jony Ive left the company</a> to create a new design firm. After Ive departed, several other members of the design team left, either joining him or moving on to other companies.<br/>
<br/>
There are very few designers remaining at Apple who worked under Ive, and Apple has lost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/another-longtime-industrial-designer-leaves-apple/">several high-profile designers</a> over the last six years.<br/>

Apple's design team will now report directly to Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/another-designer-leaves-apple/">Another Designer Leaves Apple</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/another-designer-leaves-apple.2471377/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
