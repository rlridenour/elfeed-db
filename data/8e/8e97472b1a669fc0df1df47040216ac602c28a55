<em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/steve-moser/">Steve Moser</a> discovered the new setting within the code for the first watchOS 26 beta, and a Reddit user has seemingly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/watchos/comments/1ledm1e/show_data_when_locked/">found it in action</a>, but we have yet to figure out where it is exactly. Leave a comment if you know.<br/>
<br/>
The new privacy setting allows you to toggle on or off the ability to view data in the little "complications" that appear on select watch faces.  <br/>
<br/>
There is one exception: Apple says data from the Health app will never be visible in complications when an Apple Watch is locked, regardless of the toggle's position.<br/>

This is one of the many smaller but useful quality-of-life improvements in watchOS 26 that Apple did not announce during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/wwdc-2025-live-coverage/">WWDC 2025 keynote</a>.<br/>

watchOS 26 will likely be released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/watchos-26-new-setting/">watchOS 26 Adding a Smaller Yet Useful New Watch Face Setting</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-26-adding-a-smaller-yet-useful-new-watch-face-setting.2459522/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
