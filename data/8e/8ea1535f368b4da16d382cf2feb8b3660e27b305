With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, Apple is adding support for transferring an eSIM from an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to an Android device, and vice versa. The new functionality will make it easier for smartphone users to move their numbers between platforms, alleviating the need to contact a carrier for help with a transition between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android.<br/>

Some &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/USMobile/comments/1l905db/ios_26_dark_star_native_esim_transfer_to_android/">have noticed</a> a "Transfer to Android" option in their cellular settings, though it is not an option for all plans at the current time. On Reddit, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user with US Mobile's Dark Star eSIM found a cellular option to transfer an eSIM to an Android device.<br/>
<br/>
When adding an eSIM in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, there's also a "Transfer From Android" option. Tapping on it provides a QR code that can be scanned with an Android device to start the transfer process, and that's also how the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to Android transfer process works.<br/>

Apple appears to have implemented the new functionality alongside Google. Prior to when &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; debuted, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/ios-19-esim-android-transfer/">an Android 16 beta</a> featured a reference to a "Transfer to Android" feature that hinted at the new cross-platform transferring options.<br/>

In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, it is simple to transfer an eSIM from &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but it is not easy to transfer an eSIM from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to an Android device. It typically requires contacting a carrier to get a QR code, as there is no automated way to make the transition. With &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, many &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who want to move to Android should have an easier time doing so.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/ios-26-esim-android/">iOS 26 Adds Support for Transferring an eSIM to and From Android</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-adds-support-for-transferring-an-esim-to-and-from-android.2458972/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
