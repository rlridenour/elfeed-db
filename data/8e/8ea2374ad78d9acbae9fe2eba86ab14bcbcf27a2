<p>Nice to see Flying Meat’s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acorn-8/id6737921844">Acorn</a> — one of my own favorite and most-used apps since 2007, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/09/10/acorn">before it even shipped</a> — getting this sort of recognition from Apple. Back in June, <a href="https://shapeof.com/archives/2025/6/acorn_fn_wwdc_2025_keynote.html">Apple featured Acorn in the WWDC keynote</a>, during the preview of Liquid Glass.</p>
