<p>The G20 summit in Johannesburg wrapped up with leaders adopting a broad declaration on issues such as development financing and global governance reform, while the United States stayed away after President Trump ordered a boycott over his administration’s claims that South Africa is violently persecuting its white Afrikaner minority. South Africa, which hosted the gathering and will hand the rotating presidency to the US next, portrayed the outcome as a diplomatic success that kept the forum united and committed to multilateral cooperation despite Washington’s empty chair. Other major economies used the space created by the US absence to explore new trade, climate and infrastructure initiatives among themselves and to signal that they intend to keep working together even when they disagree with Washington’s approach. The episode highlights both the strain in US–South Africa relations and a broader test for the G20’s relevance in a world where power is spreading across more players.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JohLqVyitPFjRkRyGctpY9AVhaVMDEbGZYuVePALXNwMAcjM53vhkM0kgRurmL_vl09PIQ1C9EdwVl-XzxZ3MxyVHMU17TXnC9tYdsozyIx-5BA4jVBH-iO1-yfWDZ_Fj4rKAVIVMA43VsqjSjopDpF_-SFjHmp3sLuRZkSgE1EcJ97EEGc2uUnx6i1qCUnTK6qvOMw' alt='South African President Cyril Ramaphosa speaks at the opening plenary session of the G20 summit in Johannesburg.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Host’s priorities: South African President Cyril Ramaphosa used the summit to emphasize development financing, reform of global institutions and stronger African representation in decision‑making, themes that were reflected in the final declaration agreed by the other G20 members.</li><li>Boycott rationale: The Trump administration justified skipping the summit by alleging that South Africa is engaged in violent persecution of its Afrikaner white minority, a charge Pretoria rejects and which left the US seat, normally filled by a president or senior official, unoccupied throughout the two‑day meeting.</li><li>Parallel climate efforts: Several leaders pointed to recent outcomes at COP30 as evidence that climate and energy cooperation can continue through UN channels and smaller coalitions even when the US federal government withholds support at broader forums like the G20.</li><li>New coalitions: With Washington absent, countries including European Union members and major emerging economies held side discussions on trade, digital rules and infrastructure links that focused on pragmatic deals and temporarily set aside some of their own disputes.</li><li>Future G20 role: Several leaders and commentators warned that repeated walkouts or boycotts by any large member risk undermining the G20’s role as a central steering committee for the global economy, even as they stressed that most participants still see value in keeping the forum alive.</li></ul><blockquote>The G20 has once again demonstrated that multilateralism can deliver concrete outcomes when leaders choose cooperation over confrontation. - Cyril Ramaphosa</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>South African government: Pretoria framed the summit’s closing declaration as proof it could keep a diverse group of advanced and emerging economies aligned behind multilateral cooperation despite internal tensions and the US boycott.
