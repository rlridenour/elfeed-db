<h2 id="org0c1efed">New release of epydemic</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0c1efed">
<p>
It's been a while – about 15 months since v.1.13.1 – but today I
finally released v.1.14.1 of <code>epydemic</code>, a library for epidemic (and)
other simulation over complex networks.
</p>

<p>
This release include several bug-fixes and two major changes.

<h3 id="orgb28d1d3">Better Newman-Ziff percolation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb28d1d3">
<p>
The Newman-Ziff algorithm for bond and site percolation is widely
used. The version that's been in <code>epydemic</code> for a while emphasise
speed over everything. However, in the course of some work by one
of my MSc students on how grids of different dimensions respond to
random failure, we discovered that we needed to be able to do some
more flexible operations. In particular, we wanted to sample things
other than just the size of the largest connected component, and
wanted to be able to dig into to exactly how the network was
deforming.
</p>

<p>
The problem was that this information wasn't readily available. It
<i>was</i> encoded within the algorithm's data structure, but it wasn't
being reflected as an evolving network that was easy to get at. So
we upgraded the algorithm to build a working copy of the network as
it was constructed, so that it could be interrogated by
normal <code>networkx</code> operations within the sampling process. This adds
some time penalty, but it's acceptable slowdown for the extra
capability.

<h3 id="org88cc177">Multiple process instances</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org88cc177">
<p>
<code>epydemic</code> defines different epidemic processes (and indeed
non-disease processes like pulse-coupled oscillators). Until now
these have been usable alone in a simulation, but not together: one
couldn't run <i>two</i> diseases in the <i>same</i> simulation over the <i>same</i>
population simultaneously. Doing so is obviously very desirable,
especially if you want to explore co-infecting diseases.
</p>

<p>
Co-infection is a difficult problem. As a first step we've added
multiple process instances which can have their own parameters and
results – or can share parameters if required. This involves
assigning distinct names to each instance, and then optionally
using them to decorate parameter/result names.
</p>

<p>
This is fiddly if done manually, so we also added some methods on
the <code>Process</code> class to get and set parameters and results using any
instance name on the calling process. For example:

<p>
The <code>setParameters</code> call sets the parameters decorated with the name
of the process, if it has one. There are other operations for
extracting the parameters, and for interacting with experimental
results without getting into the details of decoration.
