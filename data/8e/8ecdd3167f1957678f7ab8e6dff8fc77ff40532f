Apple at WWDC today unveiled Live Translation, a new feature that breaks down language barriers across its core communication apps. The capability works seamlessly within Messages, FaceTime, and Phone, powered by Apple-built models running entirely on-device to preserve privacy.<br/>

In Messages, Live Translation automatically translates text as users type, delivering messages in the recipient's preferred language. Responses are instantly translated back, making international conversations effortless.<br/>
<br/>
FaceTime calls gain live caption translation, allowing users to follow along with translated text while still hearing the original speaker's voice. Phone calls take it further with spoken translation throughout the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
The on-device processing ensures personal conversations remain private, with no data sent to external servers. Apple demonstrated the feature with real-time travel planning scenarios, showing how users can coordinate with friends abroad without language constraints.<br/>

Live Translation represents Apple's latest push into AI-powered communication tools, following the company's broader Apple Intelligence initiative announced at last year's WWDC. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wwdc-2025/">WWDC 2025</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-live-translation-messages-facetime-phone/">Apple Announces Live Translation for Messages, FaceTime, and Phone Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-live-translation-for-messages-facetime-and-phone-apps.2458433/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
