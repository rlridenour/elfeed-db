<p>In the latest development, Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized the long-besieged city of El Fasher (al-Fashir) in North Darfur, where survivors and circulating videos describe summary executions and mass killings of civilians as they fled or hid . Satellite imagery and local reporting indicate mass graves and large-scale burial activity, and the UN Security Council held an emergency session to condemn the violence and demand humanitarian access . Humanitarian organisations and independent Sudanese media groups say the city had been under an RSF siege for at least 18 months, leaving residents vulnerable to malnutrition, disease and restricted aid even before the recent takeover . Estimates and exact civilian tolls remain unclear because communications are disrupted and investigators are still verifying open-source videos and eyewitness accounts .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/jLzNUJNbRF0hwaw0sOdP_vJoUcPXqFH2j9orFkQAhbybPqKBMs3R0tOkxa-UBjNPbNXi_aYyssostdLGVQjCrafuZBuAfnh7C0v-FO4ATkbX3qaHgBo9jrLFWUp3bds8f8lkBQhc5WgKVF3XmvfG4UHexz9aBxgztsee6O9SIxejLeO2Oiwzmw' alt='Residents of El Fasher flee after fierce fighting and the city&#x27;s capture by RSF forces' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>International censure: The UN Security Council convened an emergency meeting to condemn the reported atrocities and called for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access to North Darfur</li><li>Hospital killings reported: Multiple accounts and reporting allege that more than 450 people were killed inside a hospital during the RSF takeover, a claim contributing to international alarm and calls for investigation</li><li>Allegations of ethnic targeting: Witnesses and fleeing civilians report ethnically targeted killings, including attacks against Zaghawa communities, a pattern flagged by human rights monitors and news organisations</li><li>RSF response: The RSF publicly acknowledged some of the violence and said it had detained fighters accused of abuses, but independent verification of those arrests and accountability remains limited</li><li>Evidence challenges: A surge of videos has circulated online showing executions, while communications blackouts and security risks complicate independent verification even as satellite imagery points to mass burial sites</li></ul><blockquote>We saw people murdered in front of us - el-Fasher survivor</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Sudan Media Forum (SMF): SMF strongly condemned escalating RSF violence in El Fasher and demanded immediate, unrestricted humanitarian access to protect trapped civilians from starvation, disease and ongoing attacks.
