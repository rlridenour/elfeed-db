<p>Suppose your dog eats the ace of spades and you&#8217;re forced to play poker with a 51-card deck. Does this make it more or less likely that you&#8217;ll be dealt a two-pair hand?</p>
<p>The answer is not immediately clear. The loss of the ace means that fewer two-pair hands are possible, but the total universe of possible five-card hands is also reduced.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the probability is unchanged. &#8220;[T]he probability of getting a Two-Pair hand in the 51-card deck with the missing Ace of Spades is exactly the same as for a 52-card standard deck,&#8221; notes George Mason University mathematician D.M. Anderson. And &#8220;[i]t turns out that this seemingly magical result for a deck with a missing Ace of Spades is not limited to Two-Pair hands. Indeed, examining the traditional hierarchy of 5-card poker hands, we find an analogous result holds for One-Pair hands, Three-of-a-Kind, Full Houses and Four-of-a-Kind.&#8221;</p>
