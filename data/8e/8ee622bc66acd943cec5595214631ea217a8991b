  <p>With Apple blocking Fortnite from returning to the U.S. App Store,
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/epic-asks-judge-apple-approve-fortnite-app-store/">Epic Games told the court</a> that Apple was violating the
injunction and asked that Apple be forced to approve the app. The
judge overseeing the case responded to Epic’s request today, and
she is sounding more and more fed up with Apple’s continued
defiance and Epic’s grousing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“More and more fed up” is perhaps euphemistic, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/1576/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">given Gonzalez Rogers’s tone today</a>.</p>
