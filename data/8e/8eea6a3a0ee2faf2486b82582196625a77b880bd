<p>In a sudden reversal on Sunday, President Trump urged House Republicans to vote to release all documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, saying &quot;we have nothing to hide,&quot; after previously opposing the move. The vote was scheduled for Tuesday in the House, and supporters say passage would require the Justice Department to hand over files and communications tied to the Epstein investigation — including material about his death in federal custody — though release could still face legal or procedural hurdles. The change followed the publication last week of a tranche of Epstein-related documents and emails that prompted heightened pressure inside the Republican conference and renewed public attention to the case.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/GbNjuVfRtDClPyrl1aZFQI3P3Cy9wbirrqR1ke2GQ11_7AHsREIgy0UYe3gr6STRAvv_hqhb0QvWzTGSELT7kA9vqenWo-GcGHkmgxg1vlqiz3Bw1vsfv01B3BRQiEqEAskAdEz6ZREngo5af47ZJuL0JRzoMVaDq2JTWaFMR15nqxf3F5zrhd1N_RzmtEsB-N9242tYW3KvI1-B_tEL2roq4q22hwBDXWPXQbU' alt='Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, in 1997.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>What a vote does: If the House bill passes, the Justice Department would be required to turn over files and communications about Epstein, including details of the federal investigation into his death, though courts or redactions could still limit public release.</li><li>GOP dynamics: House Republican leaders have faced internal pressure — some backers predicted broad GOP support for the measure and leaders warned the vote reflected mounting frustration within the conference.</li><li>New documents: A recent tranche of Epstein-related records and emails released by a House committee last week intensified scrutiny and helped prompt the President&#x27;s reversal.</li><li>Political fallout: Following the dispute over the files, the President has also instructed the Justice Department to investigate ties between Epstein and some Democrats, signaling the issue will be pursued beyond the House vote.</li></ul><blockquote>House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files because we have nothing to hide - President Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: The president said Republicans should back the release because &quot;we have nothing to hide&quot; and to &quot;move on&quot; from what he called a Democratic hoax.
