Apple reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/apple-studio-display-2-rumored-features/">plans to release a new Studio Display in the first half of 2026</a>, and there have been plenty of rumors about the monitor lately.<br/>

Below, we recap the latest Studio Display 2 rumors:<ul><li>In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk"><em>Power On</em> newsletter on Sunday</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said he was told the new Studio Display "looks quite similar to the current one," so that seemingly rules out any major design changes.</li><br/>
<li>It has twice been rumored that the Studio Display 2's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-studio-display-2-unusual-feature-rumor/">maximum refresh rate will be 90Hz</a>, instead of 120Hz. The current model is 60Hz.</li><br/>
<li>Last month, an unreleased Apple monitor (model A3350) <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/new-studio-display-or-pro-display-xdr-filing/">surfaced in a Chinese regulatory database</a>, and it is likely the Studio Display 2.</li><br/>
<li>Previously rumored features include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">27-inch screen with mini-LED backlighting</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/">HDR support</a>, and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/">A19 chip</a> or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/">A19 Pro chip</a>.</li></ul>The current Studio Display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-announces-powerful-mac-studio-with-companion-studio-display/">launched in March 2022</a>, alongside the first Mac Studio. It has a 27-inch LCD screen with 5K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, up to 600 nits brightness, a built-in camera and speakers, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and a trio of USB-C ports. In the U.S., pricing starts at &#36;1,599.<br/>
<br/>
If the next Studio Display receives mini-LED backlighting and HDR support, its maximum brightness and contrast ratio would be higher than the current model. And a newer A19 or A19 Pro chip — up from the A13 Bionic currently — should contribute to performance improvements, camera-related enhancements, and more.<br/>

Based on the rumored first half of 2026 timeframe, Apple should unveil the Studio Display 2 at any point between now and the end of June.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77">Mac Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/apple-studio-display-2-latest-rumors/">Studio Display 2: The Latest Rumors About Apple&#039;s Next Monitor</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/studio-display-2-the-latest-rumors-about-apples-next-monitor.2477414/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
