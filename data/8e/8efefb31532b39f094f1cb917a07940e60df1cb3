Apple is working on a next-generation version of the Vision Pro with an M5 chip, according to code accidentally shared by Apple and discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris. <br/>

Rumors of a Vision Pro 2 with an updated M-series chip have been circulating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/kuo-apple-vision-pro-m5-chip-apple-intelligence/">since last year</a>, but there was some confusion over which chip the device would use. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that the Vision Pro would have an M5 chip, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> claimed that it would use the same M4 chip that's in the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models rather than the M5.<br/>
<br/>
Based on Apple's code, it looks like the next-generation Vision Pro will use the M5 chip.<br/>
<br/>
The refreshed Vision Pro isn't expected to feature any design changes or hardware updates aside from the new chip, but it could get a new strap that will make it more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time.<br/>

The Vision Pro 2 with M5 chip could launch as soon as late 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-code-confirms-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">Apple Code Confirms Vision Pro With M5 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-code-confirms-vision-pro-with-m5-chip.2463339/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
