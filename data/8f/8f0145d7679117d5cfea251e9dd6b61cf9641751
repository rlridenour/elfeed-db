<p>Costa Rican voters chose Laura Fernández as their next president in Sunday’s election, with multiple outlets projecting her victory from preliminary results and reporting a wide margin. The campaign centered on the country’s sharp rise in drug-linked violence, a shift that several reports said has strained Costa Rica’s long-standing image as one of Central America’s more peaceful democracies. Fernández ran on a tough-on-crime message and pledged to push further policies associated with outgoing President Rodrigo Chaves’s populist agenda, including proposed constitutional changes and measures that could suspend some civil liberties in the name of security, according to reporting on her platform. Her victory, and early indications that her party could be strengthened in the Legislative Assembly, set the stage for a new phase of governance that will test how Costa Rica balances security demands with democratic safeguards.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Cj-333YJzCd1kAM0VYsp8DxrrU0DWKzxo6E6bWXCxbPs2_bkqzUsFCSS1sL9ADNFoneFnhV_RHzuCkZxT-BuxMjeY_D9pRbSRdGKW26wUOZhKM3Zi1-IE_03NKVB7DcDDgk36xUXCGfx9DqIoDQGsV0WsIbE2B0DrKIixZF1tNf7NxAJQD5bMHyeAgGn2cHFq-V858pyRjIkCF8hZ1n_UT7ikOG3f8TZ_9U' alt='Laura Fernández, Costa Rica’s president-elect, celebrates with supporters on Sunday evening.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Vote math: With 61.50% counted, provisional tribunal data showed Fernández at 50.23% versus 32.12% for social democrat Álvaro Ramos, a spread that pointed to a likely first-round win.</li><li>Turnout signal: Turnout was estimated around 66% from roughly 3.7 million eligible voters, suggesting high engagement despite security worries.</li><li>Assembly stakes: Voters also renewed the 57-seat Legislative Assembly, and early reporting indicated Fernández’s ruling party was on track to strengthen its position, potentially easing passage of her agenda.</li><li>Policy direction: Reports said Fernández aims to deepen the predecessor’s hardline security approach and pursue constitutional reforms, framing them as tools to confront drug trafficking networks.</li><li>Why it mattered: AFP’s live coverage described “narco-violence” as the dominant theme of election day as polling stations reported results across the country.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Laura Fernández and allies: Fernández campaigned on intensifying security measures and continuing the outgoing administration’s populist program, including constitutional reforms aimed at tackling drug-related violence.
