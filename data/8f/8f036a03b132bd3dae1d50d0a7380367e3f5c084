<p>President Trump said an in-person meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest has been put on hold because he “doesn’t want to have a wasted meeting,” after Moscow rejected an immediate ceasefire and showed no willingness to soften its demands in negotiations over the war in Ukraine [aljazeera.com#1][bbc.com#1][semafor.com#1]. The White House said there are currently “no plans” for a near-term meeting following a phone call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, which officials described as productive even as preparations stalled [thehindu.com#2][dawn.com#1]. The pause leaves bilateral diplomacy in a holding pattern while Kyiv and its European partners push for a ceasefire based on current frontlines and continue planning alternative peace proposals [semafor.com#1][dawn.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/9C0dVaLU8JwEhwgD4XBbkQlOy167uluX2KfKY5d8u2ckbdVkiyFKT5AqKppa2e1cLKM_HbMzE5xzKCA5nGVD2WeQmd9yVouJiy1sXErqLJ8v5hEOvEoqKeK67fVm6ZsE8odyvxd2-HGlgGDFkjWrL0YD8BVYUZdnX2E2JD1qQPT9RuBT9Rca_5ppCqyZOtUovnQXJNdE29wBF-dY2y5nTUlu9S3_oeEz7j6Ug1jn7aUWM0k4aLSpeGs' alt='The summit preparations appear to have stalled.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Kremlin stance: The Kremlin said there was no clear date for a summit and that “serious preparation” would be required if talks resume, signalling Moscow is not rushing to a quick in-person meeting [dawn.com#1][france24.com#1]</li><li>Analysts&#x27; view: Analysts say Moscow seeks a broader diplomatic deal that would restore its international heft and justify a stronger role inside institutions such as the UN [semafor.com#1]</li><li>Allies&#x27; approach: Ukraine and several European allies are preparing a peace plan that would end the war based on current frontlines rather than immediate territorial concessions by Kyiv [semafor.com#1]</li><li>Past meetings: A previous in-person meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska in August did not produce breakthroughs, though officials called it a step toward continued talks [rt.com#1][semafor.com#1]</li><li>Military politics: Ukraine’s leadership suggested that unresolved decisions — including on weapons such as Tomahawks — have complicated Russia’s appetite for diplomacy [dawn.com#1]</li></ul><blockquote>I don’t want to have a wasted meeting, I don’t want to have a wasted time, so I’ll see what happens - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump / White House: The president said he would not hold a meeting that might be a &#x27;waste of time&#x27; and the White House said there were currently &#x27;no plans&#x27; for an immediate meeting with President Putin [aljazeera.com#1][bbc.com#1].
