<p>A philosopher is apparently listed as the creator of part of a controversial report released May 1st by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regarding gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. <span id="more-53739"></span></p>
<p>Philosophers working for the government is a topic regularly covered here at <em>Daily Nous</em>. That&#8217;s one reason for this post, but not the only one.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services is led by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., known for his advocacy of positions widely rejected by the medical profession, scientists, and other experts. Kennedy was appointed by President Donald Trump, who, throughout his second term so far, has been attacking universities and cutting off the federal funding that supports much research in US institutions of higher education.</p>
<p>The anti-expertise and anti-education agenda of the Trump administration makes it surprising that <em>any</em> academic would agree to work for it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there seems to be some evidence that one academic&#8212;philosophy professor <a href="http://www.alexbyrne.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Byrne</a> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose writing on transgender issues <a href="https://dailynous.com/2020/06/12/resignation-philosophical-studies-reply-editors/">has</a> been <a href="https://dailynous.com/2023/04/21/what-its-like-to-be-a-philosopher-with-unpopular-views-on-a-controversial-subject/">controversial</a>&#8212;has done just that.</p>
<p>That evidence is in the metadata of the appendix of an HHS report, &#8220;<a href="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gender-dysphoria-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria</a>&#8220;. The appendix itself is titled &#8220;<a href="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gender-dysphoria-report-appendix.pdf">Overview of Systematic Reviews</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>The following is a screenshot I took of part of the metadata of the appendix, as viewable in a plain text-reader app like Notepad, which lists &#8220;Alex Byrne&#8221; as the creator of the appendix:</p>

<p>The text &#8220;&lt;dc:creator&gt;&#8221; is a tag that <a href="https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/content-manager/23.4/ContentManager_en/Content/trim_dublin_core_elements.html?TocPath=Content%20Manager%20Help%7CWeb%20publisher%7CWeb%20publisher%20layouts%20administration%7CCreating%20Web%20publisher%20layouts%7CMetadata%20tab%7C_____1#:~:text=DC.,used%20to%20indicate%20the%20entity." target="_blank" rel="noopener">refers</a> to &#8220;an entity primarily responsible for making the resource&#8221;. (The &#8220;dc&#8221; part is a reference to &#8220;<a href="https://www.dublincore.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dublin Core</a>&#8220;, a standard for metadata design.)</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the listing of Byrne&#8217;s name in the metadata was first pointed out by <a href="https://www.florenceashley.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florence Ashley</a>, an assistant professor of law at the University of Alberta, in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/floralashes.bsky.social/post/3lo4yaraw6c2u" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post on Bluesky</a> the day the report was released.</p>
<p>Whether the metadata is accurate and being interpreted correctly I can&#8217;t say for certain at this time.</p>
<p>The text of the report and appendix do not name any authors. According to a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/gender-dysphoria-report-release.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> about the report from HHS, the authors &#8220;are not initially being made public, in order to help maintain the integrity&#8221; of the report&#8217;s &#8220;post-publication peer review&#8221;. This seems disingenuous, as it is unclear why the peer review of the report isn&#8217;t already as corrupted as it could be by its public presentation and endorsement by HHS and the presumption that the report was commissioned by Kennedy at Trump&#8217;s behest.</p>
<p>I wrote to Professor Byrne asking for confirmation (and description) of his involvement in the creation of the report&#8217;s appendix, but as of the the writing of this post, he has not replied. And so neither the nature and extent of his work on the report, nor the circumstances which led to it, are public knowledge.</p>
<p>The HHS says the report &#8220;highlights a growing body of evidence pointing to significant risks [of gender-affirming medical interventions]—including irreversible harms such as infertility—while finding very weak evidence of benefit. That weakness has been a consistent finding of systematic reviews of evidence around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet the report has come in for significant criticism.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, published a <a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/aap-statement-on-hhs-report-treatment-for-pediatric-gender-dysphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">response</a> to the report, claiming it cherry-picks data and contains important errors:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>For such an analysis to carry credibility, it must consider the totality of available data and the full spectrum of clinical outcomes rather than relying on select perspectives and a narrow set of data.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>This report misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.   </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As we have seen with immunizations, bypassing medical expertise and scientific evidence has real consequences for the health of America&#8217;s children. AAP was not consulted in the development of this report, yet our policy and intentions behind our recommendations were cited throughout in inaccurate and misleading ways. The report prioritizes opinions over dispassionate reviews of evidence. </em></p>
<p><em>PBS Newshour</em> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/trumps-hhs-urges-therapy-for-transgender-youth-departing-from-broader-gender-affirming-health-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The report sharply contradicts guidance from the American Medical Association, which has urged states not to ban gender-affirming care for minors, saying that &#8220;empirical evidence has demonstrated that trans and non-binary gender identities are normal variations of human identity and expression.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Science</em> has an article about responses to the report <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/researchers-slam-hhs-report-gender-affirming-care-youth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">day one</a> of his second term, President Trump has taken aim at transgender women and men, attempting to deprive them of services, civil liberties, protections, and opportunities, and doing so with mockery and callousness. (<a href="https://www.kff.org/other/fact-sheet/overview-of-president-trumps-executive-actions-impacting-lgbtq-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> and <a href="https://glaad.org/trump-accountability-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> are surveys of some of these efforts.) Of course, trans people are not Trump&#8217;s only targets. Immigrants, government employees, the disabled, and the domestic and global poor, among others, have been on the receiving end of his cruelty. Many more would be, were his selfish and authoritarian ambitions realized. It is not unreasonable for people to have differing views about gender identity. But it would be appalling were a philosophy professor to have voluntarily decided to help Trump with any of this. So I hope that things are not actually as they appear.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: One of Byrne&#8217;s colleagues at MIT emailed him over the weekend, saying &#8220;I’m getting a LOT of email about the social media posts claiming you compiled the Appendices to the HHS report <i>Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria. </i>Among other things, people want to know if the claims are true. I don’t know what to say. Any guidance is appreciated.&#8221; Byrne replied, &#8220;Thanks. I have seen this floating around on social media. I’m afraid I can’t shed any light on this – I’m sorry!&#8221; When the colleague asked if they could share his response, Byrne wrote, &#8220;Sure (not at all helpful, admittedly).&#8221;</p>
