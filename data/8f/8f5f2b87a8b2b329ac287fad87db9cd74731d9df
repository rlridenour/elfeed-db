Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models will feature a redesigned rear camera panel that spans the width of the device, but it will be the same color as the iPhone itself, rather than being part of a two-tone design.<br/>

That's according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-06/will-apple-raise-iphone-prices-in-the-us-after-trump-tariffs-iphone-17-details"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Writing in his latest Power On newsletter, the reporter says the iPhone 17 Pro won't have a two-toned back, as some renders have depicted. "The camera area will be the same color as the rest of the device," he says.<br/>
<blockquote>Some images online even show a two-tone design, with a dark-black camera block on top of a silver iPhone back. Those are, like many renders on the internet, not an accurate representation of what's to come.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro won't have a two-toned back, I'm told. The camera area will be the same color as the rest of the device. </blockquote>In this sense, apart from the new Google Pixel-esque camera module, the iPhone 17 Pro "won't a major departure from current models," reckons Gurman.<br/>

According to <em>The Information</em>, Apple has chosen a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/">half glass, half aluminum build</a> for its iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max to increase durability. The glass will allow wireless charging to continue to be available, while a partial aluminum frame will be less prone to breakage. <br/>

This year's iPhone 17 series will also include a new ultra-slim iPhone 17 "Air" model that replaces the Plus device in the lineup. The new models are expected to be announced in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/iphone-17-pro-no-two-tone-rear-design/">iPhone 17 Pro&#039;s New Rear Camera Bar &#039;Same Color As Rest of Device&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pros-new-rear-camera-bar-same-color-as-rest-of-device.2454869/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
