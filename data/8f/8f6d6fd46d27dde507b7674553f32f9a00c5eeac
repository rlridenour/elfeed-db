<p>Apple is nothing if not consistent. That announcement we all expected might happen today, happened today: Apple is giving the world two weeks’ notice that its next media event (which we all know is an iPhone launch event, though Apple never admits that) will be on September 9 at 10am Pacific.</p>
<p>The tag line for this event is: “Awe dropping.” It’s expected to include new iPhone and iPhone Pro models as well as a new, ultra-thin iPhone design never seen before.</p>
<p>If the usual timelines continue to be usual, this means the first new iPhones will arrive in the hands of Apple customers on September 19, and Apple will presumably release the first official versions of its new 26-era operating systems earlier that week.</p>
