The iOS 18.5 update that Apple plans to release next week will enable carrier-provided satellite features on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 13 models, adding satellite connectivity to iPhones that do not support Apple's built-in satellite functionality through Globalstar.<br/>

Apple says that satellite connectivity provided by carriers will be enabled on all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 models, including the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 mini, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro Max. To use the feature, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 users will need cellular service that offers a satellite connectivity option, and there are several carriers that have been rolling out the functionality.<br/>

In the United States, T-Mobile has partnered with SpaceX to provide customers with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/28/ios-18-3-starlink-t-mobile-support/">Starlink Direct service</a> for connecting to Starlink satellites when Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity are unavailable. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/apple-carrier-satellite-services-expansion/">au and One NZ</a> have also introduced satellite connectivity, as has Verizon, though <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/19/verizon-new-satellite-texting-feature/">Verizon's satellite option</a> does not currently work with &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>

Apple has included built-in satellite connectivity in all iPhones dating back to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 lineup, with connectivity provided through a partnership with Globalstar. Satellite connectivity is useful in rural and remote areas where cellular towers are not available.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/ios-18-5-satellite-connectivity-iphone-13/">iOS 18.5 Brings Support for Carrier Satellite Connectivity to iPhone 13</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-5-brings-support-for-carrier-satellite-connectivity-to-iphone-13.2456614/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
