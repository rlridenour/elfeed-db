Sometimes I want to change the status (<code class="verbatim">i3status</code>) of <code class="verbatim">i3wm</code> temporarily, but it seems that <code class="verbatim">i3wm</code> doesn&#39;t support it directly, although reloading the config for <code class="verbatim">i3wm</code> itself is a piece of cake (<code class="verbatim">bindsym $mod+Shift+c reload</code> in the config, or <code class="verbatim">i3-msg -t command reload</code> in the command line).</p>
<p>
But this issue scratched my itch, and I swear that I must solve it today.</p>
