<p>Another exercise in linguistic purism: In his 1989 essay <a href="https://msburkeenglish.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/uncleftish-beholding-aka-atomic-theory.pdf">&#8220;Uncleftish Beholding,&#8221;</a> Poul Anderson tries to explain atomic theory using Germanic words almost exclusively, coining terms of his own as needed:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The firststuffs have their being as motes called <em>unclefts</em>. These are mightly small; one seedweight of waterstuff holds a tale of them like unto two followed by twenty-two naughts. Most unclefts link together to make what are called <em>bulkbits</em>. Thus, the waterstuff bulkbit bestands of two waterstuff unclefts, the sourstuff bulkbit of two sourstuff unclefts, and so on. (Some kinds, such as sunstuff, keep alone; others, such as iron, cling together in ices when in the fast standing; and there are yet more yokeways.) When unlike clefts link in a bulkbit, they make <em>bindings</em>. Thus, water is a binding of two waterstuff unclefts with one sourstuff uncleft, while a bulkbit of one of the forestuffs making up flesh may have a thousand thousand or more unclefts of these two firststuffs together with coalstuff and chokestuff.

<p>Reader Justin Hilyard, who let me know about this, adds, &#8220;This sort of not-quite-conlang is still indulged in now and then today; it&#8217;s often known as &#8216;Anglish&#8217;, after a coining by British humorist Paul Jennings in 1966, in a three-part series in <em>Punch</em> magazine celebrating the 900th anniversary of the Norman conquest. He also wrote some passages directly inspired by William Barnes in that same Germanic-only style.&#8221;</p>
