<p>During her lifetime, the medieval abbess <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2018/06/experience-the-mystical-music-of-hildegard-von-bingen.html">Hildegard von Bingen</a> (1098–1179) composed roughly 77 songs and hymns. She remains the earliest known woman composer in Western classical music and one of the most important composers of the High Middle Ages.</p>
<p>In her honor, a YouTuber who goes by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Hildegardvonblingin">Hildegard von Blingin’</a> has developed a penchant for making Bardcore music, “a pastiche genre that takes modern songs and makes them ‘old-timey’ with Medieval and Renaissance inspired instrumentation.” Most of the instrumentals feature a mix of virtual and real instruments, including the Celtic harp, Irish whistle, and recorder.</p>
<p>Hildy’s latest release offers a creative take on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwtdhWltSIg">R.E.M.’s “Losing My Religion,”</a> complete with some revised lyrics:</p>
<p>I thought that I heard thee laughing<br>
I thought that I heard thee sing<br>
I think I thought I saw thee try<br>
That was but a dream<br>
That was but a dream<br>
That’s me in the corner<br>
‘Tis I in the corner<br>
‘Tis I in the firelight, losing my religion</p>
<p>If you need a short escape from reality, this will serve you well. Enjoy!</p>
