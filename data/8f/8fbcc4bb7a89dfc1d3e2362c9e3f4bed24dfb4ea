<p>In the latest development, Israel moved to open the Rafah crossing and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza after Hamas transferred four more bodies of deceased hostages, reversing earlier plans to halve aid deliveries and keep the crossing closed [reuters.com#1][theguardian.com#4][npr.org#2][theguardian.com#1][euronews.com#1]. Hamas’ handover brings the total to eight bodies returned since the ceasefire began, though Israel said one of the four bodies delivered Tuesday did not match any of the hostages held in Gaza [apnews.com#1][bbc.com#2][france24.com#2][washingtonpost.com#1][abc.net.au#1]. The U.S.-proposed ceasefire introduced by President Trump requires Hamas to return all remaining hostages — with the last 20 living hostages freed on Monday — and, if some remains cannot be located by the deadline, to share information and continue efforts to recover them; Israel also released about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase [apnews.com#1][cbsnews.com#2]. Hamas says Gaza’s destruction has made locating burial sites difficult, and aid groups reported limited convoys so far, though Israeli media said 600 trucks were planned for Wednesday, mostly carrying food and medical supplies [nytimes.com#1][theguardian.com#1][dawn.com#1][thehindu.com#3][straitstimes.com#4].
