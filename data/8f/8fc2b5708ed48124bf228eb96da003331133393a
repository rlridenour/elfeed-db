YouTube is deliberately slowing video loading for users with ad blockers enabled, in what appears to be an escalation in Google's campaign against ad-blocking extensions.<br/>

Multiple users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Adblock/comments/1l9l9v5/youtube_subtly_telling_me_that_its_slowing_down/">across</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1l8oq5y/theyre_slowing_down_performance_if_you_use_an/">Reddit</a> and the <a href="https://community.brave.com/t/experiencing-interruptions-with-ad-blocker-on-youtube/623940/2">Brave browser forum</a> report videos displaying black screens for the typical duration of pre-roll ads before content begins playing. The video player simultaneously shows a pop-up ("Experiencing interruptions? Find out why") with a link directing users to a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3037019#check_ad_blockers&zippy=%2Ccheck-your-extensions-including-ad-blockers&xcust=2-1-2814755-1-0-0-0-0-01JY402P8Z48BKY0V6W5H643BD&sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2814755/youtube-might-slow-down-your-videos-if-you-block-ads.html">Google support page</a> about disabling ad-blocking extensions, suggesting the slowdowns are intentional.<br/>
<br/>
The recent crackdown is a shift from YouTube's previous tactics of simply displaying warning messages or blocking video playback entirely. The new approach inserts artificial delays that mirror the time you would spend watching advertisements, basically forcing the same annoying time investment, whether ads are blocked or not.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like specific user accounts previously flagged for ad-blocking behavior are being targeted, potentially bypassing detection methods that extension developers typically use to counter YouTube's measures. <em><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2814755/youtube-might-slow-down-your-videos-if-you-block-ads.html">PCWorld</a></em> confirmed the behavior using uBlock Origin Lite, while Brave browser users report similar experiences despite the browser's built-in ad-blocking capabilities.<br/>

This latest move suggests YouTube is prepared to significantly degrade the user experience for non-paying users who refuse to view advertisements or subscribe to the &#36;13.99 monthly YouTube Premium service, which offers an ad-free experience, offline downloads, and background playback. <br/>

For what it's worth, YouTube recently introduced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/youtube-premium-lite-ad-free-tier-launch-us/">Premium Lite plan</a> for &#36;7.99/month that removes ads for most videos, excluding music content, Shorts, and when you search or browse.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/">YouTube</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/19/youtube-slowing-video-loading-ad-blockers/">YouTube&#039;s Latest Move Against Ad Blockers: Video Delays</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtubes-latest-move-against-ad-blockers-video-delays.2459302/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
