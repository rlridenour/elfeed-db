</ul><h1>Very Simple</h1><p>A few years ago, I finally achieved a certain level of enlightenment when it came to my body.</p>
<p>I realized I don’t need to get on the scale all the time. How I felt when I woke up, how my clothes fit, how I looked in the mirror, my appetite, my energy level–all of these things could give me a pretty good impression of “how I was doing” and, what’s more, my sense of each of them grew stronger without tying them to a number.</p>
<p>It was great, honestly.</p>
<p>And then, I hurt my back and couldn’t exercise for a while. Which, in turn, led to some other health issues. Which, in turn, led me back to the scale.</p>
<p>No longer could I rely solely on tidbits of information like which belt loop I was using, because:</p>
<p>A. I needed something a bit more scientific,</p>
<p>and…</p>
<p>B. I’m a writer who works from home. You think I wear pants that take BELTS?! LOL! Yeah right! If I trade the pajama pants I put on when I wake up for a pair of fresh sweat shorts before noon, that’s a “fancy day” around here.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my sales pitch for this scale we’re selling today.</p>
<p>Among scales we’ve sold, this has got to be one of the absolute simplest. You step on it. It tells you how much you weigh. That’s about it. Sure, it can track weight for two different users, but it doesn’t boast a number of measurements that you don’t need and, frankly, will only frustrate and upset you.</p>
<p>All of this makes it an ideal piece of equipment. It’s useful, but won’t inspire over-use. Because that way leads to madness.</p>
<p>Anyone who’s ever tried to lose or gain some weight knows this insanity. One day, you’re down a pound, the next day you’re up three from that, the day after that down four somehow. It’s more stock chart than linear graph, and that means it can be hard to see the big picture trends through all the day-to-day noise. You’ll find yourself fretting over your diet and activity level when really, you’re doing fine, except one day you just happen to have a more productive bowel movement.</p>
<p>(Ew, gross, sorry.)</p>
<p>(But you know it’s true.)</p>
<p>Anyway, with such a simple scale, capable of providing a single measurement, you’re likely to step on it only when you need to. And that’s good.</p>
<p>Now, you’re probably thinking: is our sales pitch really ‘get yourself a nice scale that you won’t use <em>too</em> much’?</p>
<p>And the answer is: Yes. Yes, it is.</p>
<p>So do it, get yourself a nice scale that you won’t use <em>too</em> much.</p>
