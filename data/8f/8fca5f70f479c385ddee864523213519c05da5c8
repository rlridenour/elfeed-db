WhatsApp has rolled out a new feature on iPhone that lets you set reminder alerts for specific messages that you want to come back to later.<br/>

Available in version 25.25.74 of WhatsApp, the feature allows you to long press on any message in a conversation thread and select a new "Remind me" option in the popup menu. You can then choose between 2 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours, or set a custom duration after which you will be alerted about it.<br/>
<br/>
The new feature is useful for keeping track of important details that might otherwise get lost in busy chats. It's also a simple way to make sure you don't forget to reply to a message at a later time. Here's how to set your first message reminder in WhatsApp:<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Set a Message Reminder in WhatsApp</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Open a WhatsApp conversation thread and long press on a message bubble that you want to be reminded about later.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>More...</strong> in the popup menu.</li><br/>
<li>Select <strong>Remind Me</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Select <strong>in 2 hours</strong>, <strong>in 8 hours</strong>, <strong>in 24 hours</strong>, or choose <strong>Custom</strong> to set a more specific reminder time and date.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/whatsapp-set-message-reminder.jpg" alt="whatsapp" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020014" /><br/>
<br/>
A bell symbol appears in the corner of the message bubble to indicate a reminder has been set. When the reminder alert comes through as a notification, depending on your message preview settings you may see the message content, the conversation in which it's located, and a preview of any accompanying media.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to schedule a reminder about a message should be a lot more convenient and foolproof than, say, starring a message or taking a screenshot of it and hoping you'll remember to come back to it. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Cancel a WhatsApp Message Reminder</h2><br/>
If you want to cancel a reminder that you've set, simply long press a message showing the bell symbol, tap <strong>More...</strong> then choose <strong>Cancel Reminder</strong>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/whatsapp-how-to-set-a-message-reminder/">WhatsApp: How to Set a Message Reminder</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-how-to-set-a-message-reminder.2466342/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
