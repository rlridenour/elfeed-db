Apple is planning to launch new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models in the near future, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk">Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>

Writing in today's "<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk">Power On</a>" newsletter, Gurman explained that updated iPads are "coming soon," including a new entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and a new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Both devices are not expected to feature design changes or major enhancements, instead focusing on new chips. The 12th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is set to feature the A18 chip, while the eighth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will apparently feature the M4 chip. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> is said to be the only new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; set to get a bigger upgrade this year, moving to an OLED display.<br/>
<br/>
The new chip is perhaps most significant for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, which will facilitate <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support on the device for the first time. Apple announced the 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in March 2025 with the A16 chip, which does not support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, despite the technology being widely available across Apple's other devices at that time. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; saw strong sales over the holidays, largely driven by the entry-level model. Apple purportedly plans to market the new model heavily to enterprise customers.<br/>
