<p>Trying to improve my workflow with Outlook and Emacs&hellip; and getting a headache. Nothing.
My workplace blocks any third-party syncing options with Outlook, so I&rsquo;m unable to set up email inside Emacs. Outlook doesn&rsquo;t even generate links to an email (without API, which I have no access to)</p>
