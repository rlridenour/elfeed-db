<p>Marco Arment, moved to write his first blog post in 11 months:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For unspecified reasons, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/29/the-talk-show-live-tickets-2025">Apple has declined to participate this
year</a>, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our
community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back.
(<a href="https://marco.org/2021/06/03/developer-relations">A lot has changed</a> in the meantime.)</p>

<p>Maybe Apple has good reasons. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">Maybe not</a>. We’ll see what
their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that
Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human,
unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and
that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation
to our community and developers in this way.</p>

<p>I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case
for long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’ve invited members of the media to a screening of <em>F1 The Movie</em> Tuesday at 7:00pm in the Steve Jobs Theater. Thankfully, my press invitation from Apple has it marked as “optional”, because I have <a href="https://ti.to/daringfireball/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2025">a conflict</a>.</p>
