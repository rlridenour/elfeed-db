<p>I&rsquo;ve made some big changes to my blog! This post is just for me to document what I&rsquo;ve done and why, as well as to test some of the new features I&rsquo;ve added.</p>
<h2 id="new-fonts">
  New fonts

<p>First off: new fonts! I am using <a href="https://mbtype.com/fonts/valkyrie/">Valkyrie</a> for the body text and <a href="https://mbtype.com/fonts/concourse/">Concourse</a> for the headings. I&rsquo;ve increased the font size on larger displays for added legibility. I also made the background a little darker for better contrast.</p>
<h2 id="margin-notes-and-sidenotes">
  Margin notes and sidenotes
  <a class="anchor" href="#margin-notes-and-sidenotes">#</a>
</h2>
<span class="marginnote">
<p>I stole the margin notes code from <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">Tufte CSS</a>. It&rsquo;s still a little rough, but it&rsquo;s getting there.</p>
</span>
<p>Next up: margin notes. I wanted to try adding margin notes to this blog for some time. Adding margin notes necessitated a whole host of changes; the biggest one is that the table of contents has moved from the right side of the page to the left column. This is to free up some space.</p>
<span class="marginnote">
<p>In the original version, I was using the currency sign &ldquo;¤&rdquo; to mark in the text where you could click to expand the margin note.</p>
</span>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on mobile, the margin note will appear as an inline block. This is a departure from how Tufte CSS works; I&rsquo;m copying how Matthew Butterick does margin notes, as you can see <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/white-space-characters.html">on Practical Typography</a>.</p>
<p>The blog now has sidenotes<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="whatever2"></label>
<input id="whatever2" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox">
<span class="sidenote">
This is a <em>sidenote</em>. The big difference between a sidenote and a margin note is that sidenotes have numbers.
</span>
as well as margin notes. I&rsquo;m not yet sure which one I&rsquo;ll use primarily. I like how clean the margin notes look, but the numbers on the sidenotes make it a.) easier to figure out what note goes where, and b.) act more like a drop-in replacement for footnotes. I understand there&rsquo;s a significant amount of trickery involved in getting these sidenotes and margin notes to line up properly: it has something to do with floats, negative margins, and exclusion zones. Go check out the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">Tufte CSS source</a> if you&rsquo;re curious. I might go through some recent posts<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn3"></label>
<input id="sn3" class="margin-toggle" type="checkbox">
<span class="sidenote">
Recent, as in, since I started using ox-hugo to write my blog posts.
</span>
and convert footnotes to sidenotes.</p>
<h2 id="epigraphs">
  Epigraphs
  <a class="anchor" href="#epigraphs">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Typical quotes look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have moved into a dark place. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.</p>
<p><em>Zork I</em> by Infocom</p></blockquote>
<span class="marginnote">
<p>If you have not played Zork, you really should.</p>
</span>
<p>That&rsquo;s all fine and well. But sometimes we need more… <em>elegance</em>.</p>
<div class="epigraph">
<blockquote>
<p>You have moved into a dark place. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.</p>
<footer>
<p><em>Zork I</em> by Infocom</p>
</footer></blockquote>
</div>
<p>That will definitely add some pizzazz for when I want to quote something at the beginning or end of a post.</p>
<h2 id="overkill">
  Overkill?
  <a class="anchor" href="#overkill">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Obviously. I&rsquo;m liking how this is shaping up. It might be a little overkill for just my blog, but it makes me happy, so that&rsquo;s a win!</p>
