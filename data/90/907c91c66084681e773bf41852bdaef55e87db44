Starting today, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; 1, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Hits, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Country, Apple Música Uno, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Club, and &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Chill will be available to TuneIn's 75 million monthly active users. The stations continue to feature no commercials. A link inside the TuneIn app and on its website directs users to &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
TuneIn is a cross-platform internet-based radio service that lets users stream live radio stations, music channels, news, sports, and podcasts from around the world through a single app or its website. Apple reportedly approached TuneIn about the partnership toward the end of last year.<br/>

In an effort to combat Spotify, Apple apparently aims to convert &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; radio listeners into paying subscribers. Unlike Spotify, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; has no ad-supported function, leaving it with few methods to entice users beyond free trials.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s share of digital music subscribers in the United States reportedly fell from 30% in 2020 to 25% at the end of 2024. Meanwhile, Spotify's share increased from 31% to 37% over the same period. &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s global marketshare has fallen from 16% to 12%.<br/>

Back in 2019, TuneIn announced a collaboration with Apple to bring TuneIn's more than 100,000 global radio stations to &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/27/apple-music-radio-now-in-tunein/">Apple Music Radio Stations Now Available via TuneIn</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-radio-stations-now-available-via-tunein.2464123/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
