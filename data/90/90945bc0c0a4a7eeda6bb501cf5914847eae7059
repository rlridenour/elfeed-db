<p>Examination questions from the final Classical Honours School at Oxford University, 1899 &#8212; &#8220;to have passed through it was the hallmark of a superbly educated man, and its graduates went on to rule the nation and, in that heyday of British imperialism, half the world too&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sketch the history of the Syracusan democracy between the fall of Thrasybulus in 466 B.C. and the accession of Dionysius I in 406 B.C.</li>
<li>Is it a fact that thought begins not with the term but with the judgement?</li>
<li>Describe the circumstances which led to the Bank Charter Act of 1844.</li>
<li>What were the leading characteristics of fourth-century tyranny?</li>
<li>To what extent does history confirm Machiavelli&#8217;s views on mercenary armies?</li>
<li>In what respects has Aristotle&#8217;s advance in psychology enabled him to improve on the moral theories of Plato?</li>
<li>What account can be given of our perception of distance?</li>
<li>What is the ground of the obligation to veracity?</li>
<li>Trace the history of the principle of betterment in the English system of local taxation.</li>
<li>Describe the relations of Rome with Numidia at different periods of history.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;The general assumption was that a man who had mastered this range of thought and theory could master anything.&#8221;</p>
