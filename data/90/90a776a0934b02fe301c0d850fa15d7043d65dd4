<p>In the latest development in a growing transatlantic dispute, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the country faces a “decisive moment” as President Trump renewed comments about taking control of Greenland and suggested he could use force. President Trump has argued that Greenland is vital to U.S. national security, citing concerns about Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic and the island’s strategic importance. European allies have publicly backed Denmark and emphasized Greenland’s right to decide its own future, while discussions among NATO members have intensified around Arctic security and deterrence.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/hX7IvbuHWoLrsyKJF_6xVh4K4HDBlom2GN0XguRKo8ytfxGkHnBzot-fw5Uu5SWNJJdcZM77yhmrccxhf_sBf6PLgz9MNt84Hle9YlQGlp693WbG2Rkh_whj8SL_D8EIx8jOyaTq_hf-hf6gnPR6IS4qvmAwcQUjklJ1AAv7sk6sHp4_eap3wTD0sXpCkbVpa_IPGwrPcXmkQ6h1G3ULSvJ7a_Hcn0RI30JvKnghJBKH5N1ZKdovgvFJWg' alt='Mette Frederiksen says &quot;we are ready to defend our values — wherever it is necessary — also in the Arctic&quot;.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Arctic security: Germany said it will increase its Arctic role, with German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul saying he wants to discuss in NATO “how we can best bear this responsibility,” amid the Greenland dispute.</li><li>NATO planning: British officials confirmed they are discussing with NATO allies how to enhance Arctic security, while describing related talks on deterring Russia around Greenland as “business as usual”.</li><li>Denmark’s rebuttal: Rasmus Jarlov, chair of Denmark’s parliamentary defense committee, called claims of a major China/Russia threat to Greenland “delusional” and wrote that he had seen intelligence indicating “There are no ships, no submarines” in the area.</li><li>Defense posture: After earlier U.S. pressure, Copenhagen said it would bolster Greenland defenses by adding dog sled patrols and buying two additional Arctic inspection vessels to supplement an aging fleet of four.</li><li>Rules and leverage: Analysts noted Greenland is outside the EU while Denmark is an EU member, and the island falls under NATO’s collective defense through Denmark—constraints that shape EU and NATO options in any standoff.</li></ul><blockquote>We are ready to defend our values — wherever it is necessary — also in the Arctic - Mette Frederiksen</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Denmark (Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen): Frederiksen said Denmark is at a “decisive moment” in the Greenland dispute and framed the issue as defending Danish and European values, including in the Arctic.
