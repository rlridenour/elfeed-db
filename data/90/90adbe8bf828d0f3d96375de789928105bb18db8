Apple has "run into snags" testing the more personalized, smarter version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> that's planned for iOS 26.4, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/apple-s-ios-26-4-siri-update-runs-into-snags-in-internal-testing-ios-26-5-27">Bloomberg</a></em>. Because of the issues, the upcoming &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features will be spread across several upcoming iOS releases and won't all come in the spring iOS 26.4 update.<br/>

Apple could postpone some or all of the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features until iOS 26.5, an update planned for May, and iOS 27, which will launch this September.<br/>
<br/>
We've been waiting on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; since iOS 18, when Apple debuted the features at the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference. At the time, rumors suggested a spring 2025 launch. When spring rolled around, Apple announced that the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">would take longer than expected</a>, with the functionality delayed for a year.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/">targeting iOS 26.4</a>, which the company will begin testing later this month. As Apple has been testing the updated version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; ahead of the release of the first iOS 26.4 beta, there have been unforeseen problems. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; sometimes doesn't properly process queries and can take too long to respond to requests.<br/>
<br/>
Apple engineers have been told to use iOS 26.5 for further internal testing, suggesting the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features will be delayed until that update. Internally, iOS 26.5 includes notices describing the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features, as well as a "preview" toggle for turning on the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; personalization feature that lets the personal assistant tap into user data like text messages and emails.<br/>
<br/>
Employees that are testing iOS 26.5 say the update includes all of the features Apple promised, including personalization, onscreen awareness, and the ability for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to do more in and between apps, but not all of the features are working reliably and there are problems with accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; also apparently sometimes falls back on using ChatGPT for information instead of relying on the Gemini-powered technology that Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-future-apple-intelligence-features/">partnered with Google</a> to use, even when the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is capable of handling a user's request.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also planned to include features that haven't been announced, such as options to generate images or search the web. Image generation and web search were tested as part of iOS 26.4, and it's possible they will still be included in the update, so Apple might still be able to announce some of the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality. Image generation uses <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, and web search summarizes information from the web.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> says the situation is "fluid," though, so Apple's plans could change, and executives are reluctant to further delay the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality beyond spring 2026.<br/>
<br/>
There are still major changes planned for iOS 27, with Apple aiming to add chatbot functionality to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to allow it to better compete with chatbots like Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT. That version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will have deep integration with Apple's operating systems.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/">New Siri Runs Into Problems, Features Could Be Pushed to iOS 26.5 and iOS 27</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-siri-runs-into-problems-features-could-be-pushed-to-ios-26-5-and-ios-27.2477561/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
