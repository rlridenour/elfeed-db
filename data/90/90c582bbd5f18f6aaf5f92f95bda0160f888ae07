<p>micro.blog is one of the few places I know where not all the blogs are made by web developers or IT folks.  Not that I have anything against IT folks (I am one myself) - I just wish more people would feel comfortable having their own website. I feel like it&rsquo;s almost like having a driving license.</p>
