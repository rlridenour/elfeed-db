<p>&#8220;Good tests kill flawed theories; we remain alive to guess again.&#8221; &#8212; Karl Popper</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two possible outcomes: if the result confirms the hypothesis, then you&#8217;ve made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you&#8217;ve made a discovery.&#8221; &#8212; Enrico Fermi</p>
<p>&#8220;This particular thesis was addressed to me a quarter of a century ago by John Campbell, who &#8230; told me that all theories are proven wrong in time. &#8230; My answer to him was, &#8216;John, when people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was [perfectly] spherical, they were wrong. But if <em>you</em> think that thinking the Earth is spherical is <em>just as wrong</em> as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.&#8217; The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that &#8216;right&#8217; and &#8216;wrong&#8217; are absolute; that everything that isn&#8217;t perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong. However, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s so. It seems to me that right and wrong are fuzzy concepts.&#8221; &#8212; Isaac Asimov, <em>The Relativity of Wrong</em>, 1988</p>
