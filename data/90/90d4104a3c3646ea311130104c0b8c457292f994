<p>Iran is sending senior officials to Oman, which is mediating indirect talks with the United States, as both sides prepare for another round of negotiations amid heightened tensions. Iranian officials said the initial Oman contacts were meant to test how serious Washington is, and that they saw enough common ground to keep the diplomatic track open. Iran says it will not expand the talks beyond the nuclear programme, while U.S. and Israeli officials want a broader agenda that also covers Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its support for regional armed groups. The diplomatic push comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travels to Washington to meet President Trump this week, with Iran policy and Gaza expected to be on the agenda.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/d8kwuJeZiXor1qYrHFYTjCB94t-FnaNfnJ_7Ai4qM2yMfpTCbgdmF8GKfQzSQvhHqAdSzTriovz-gPVYAztbm2FyiWnx5_UG3cFpAa9arXQiaQ2OsGZiTE3fr6u32fammhfwzHxPdDgP3UNvseM66Uc-PeuwnBXd9C8v-RFm45otOkkGRWA7TjxVmsYm5AUUI_-RMM7EANvJCz7NJWqYSVXvUcyehIt9QLrQapn0FGzNQ4kY5yM95d2S4sNIwFaoeIJfjiGm0AHA5VIDLA' alt='Iranian newspapers report on the first round of U.S.-Iran talks, Tehran, Feb. 7, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who is traveling: Ali Larijani, the former Iranian Parliament speaker who now serves as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, traveled to Oman and was expected to deliver Iran’s response to last week’s first indirect round.</li><li>Netanyahu’s ask: Netanyahu says he will press President Trump to demand limits not only on Iran’s nuclear program but also on ballistic missiles and Iran’s ties to regional militant groups.</li><li>Tehran’s warning: Foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei warned that “foreign pressures, especially Israeli pressures” could derail diplomacy ahead of Netanyahu’s Washington visit.</li><li>Military backdrop: Reuters coverage cited by Al-Monitor says the contacts resumed as the U.S. increased its military posture in the region, including the deployment of a naval flotilla.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iran foreign ministry: Spokesman Esmail Baqaei said Iran is determined to pursue national interests through diplomacy after the “June experience,” and stressed that Tehran’s focus remains the nuclear file.
