The update offers real-time collaboration with third-party apps like Asana, Slack, Figma, Canva, and more without requiring users to switch between tabs or apps.<br/>
<br/>
The feature is powered by MCP Apps, a new extension to the Model Context Protocol that lets any MCP server deliver an interactive interface within supporting AI products. Anthropic open-sourced MCP last year as a universal standard for connecting tools to AI applications.<br/>
<br/>
Per Anthropic's announcement, here's what you can now do directly in Claude:<br/>
<blockquote>Amplitude – Build analytics charts, then explore trends and adjust parameters interactively to uncover hidden insights.<br/>
<br/>
Asana – Turn chats into projects, tasks, and timelines your team can see and execute in Asana.<br/>
<br/>
Box – Search for files, preview documents inline, then extract insights and ask questions about your content.<br/>
<br/>
Canva – Create presentation outlines, then customize branding and design in real-time to produce client-ready decks.<br/>
<br/>
Clay – Research companies, find contacts with email and phone info, pull data like company size and funding, then draft personalized outreach directly in your conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Figma – Prompt to turn text and images into flow charts, Gantt charts, or other visual diagrams in FigJam.<br/>
<br/>
Hex – Ask data questions and get answers complete with interactive charts, tables, and citations.<br/>
<br/>
monday.com – Manage your work, run projects, update boards, smartly assign tasks, and visualize progress with insights.<br/>
<br/>
Slack (from Salesforce) – Search and retrieve Slack conversations for context, generate message drafts, format them your way, and review before you post.<br/>
</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Interactive tools are available on web and desktop for Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans, with support said to be coming to Claude Cowork down the line.<br/>
