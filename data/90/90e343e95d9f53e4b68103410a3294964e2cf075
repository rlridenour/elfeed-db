<p>Thailand announced it would suspend implementation of a recently signed ceasefire with Cambodia after soldiers were wounded by a landmine along the disputed border, saying the incident shows a continuing security threat and that steps must pause until clarity is restored. The agreement, signed in Malaysia just over two weeks earlier and which President Trump attended and credited as brokered by him, was meant to halt a five-day flare-up between the neighbours. Thai officials reported injuries among troops on patrol and have lodged a formal protest with Phnom Penh as they review next steps.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/GOs5uyb8Z6fTI5VuPSrcu_4PQBNgxY4D10DvRHAH0FiRlHAYFyeQIourcABeqRtg_Jn5CkND7Pj2qyNIr_gjJjNssWBO_RKkM_aGKFZ94b-tmu9_GNZBeoBHTKIAIIArfMVFO78h5uAX0SDKQGCaX42syOfkxIwDokFkBDzykLyhaZN9vkdxKdMpwq2r6beuuhMHQIZDF5TcLVUuFfWl8w' alt='A Thai soldier walking near the disputed Thai-Cambodian border in August, where land mines were found deployed.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Cambodia&#x27;s view: Cambodian officials denied the claim that the mine was newly placed, saying the explosive was likely a remnant from earlier conflicts rather than a fresh act of hostility.</li><li>Military assessment: Thailand&#x27;s defence minister said the patrol route was regularly checked and therefore concluded the mine must have been freshly laid, a claim that escalated tensions.</li><li>Repatriation paused: Bangkok put on hold plans to return 18 captured Cambodian soldiers — the next step in the pact’s implementation — after the border incident.</li><li>How the deal began: The Kuala Lumpur accord was signed late last month after a five-day military flare-up and was publicly linked to President Trump, who attended the ceremony and said he helped broker the pact.</li></ul><blockquote>What happened demonstrates hostility towards Thailand and a continued security threat...
