The upcoming iPhone 17 Pro might be more expensive than the iPhone 16 Pro, according to some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/iphone-17-pro-minimum-256gb-storage-up-from-128gb/">leakers</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/09/iphone-17-higher-prices-likely-says-analyst/">analysts</a>. Will it, though?<br/>

If that sounds like a familiar rumor to you, that is because it is:<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/10/iphone-14-pro-price-increase-kuo/">iPhone 14 Pro price increase rumor</a></li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/major-price-hike-rumored-for-iphone-15-pro-models/">iPhone 15 Pro price increase rumor</a></li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/both-iphone-16-pro-models-256gb-base-storage/">iPhone 16 Pro price increase rumor</a></li></ul>A previously-accurate leaker on the Chinese platform Weibo claimed the smaller iPhone 17 Pro model with a 6.3-inch display will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/iphone-17-pro-minimum-256gb-storage-up-from-128gb/">start at &#36;1,049 in the U.S. with 256GB of storage</a>, whereas the iPhone 16 Pro starts at &#36;999 with 128GB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has offered at least one Pro model or equivalent tier of the iPhone at a starting price of &#36;999 in the U.S. since the iPhone X was released in 2017, so the iPhone 17 Pro would break an eight-year streak held by the company.<br/>
<br/>
The starting prices of each model in the U.S.:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone X: &#36;999</li><br/>
<li>iPhone XS: &#36;999</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 11 Pro: &#36;999</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 12 Pro: &#36;999</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 13 Pro: &#36;999</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro: &#36;999</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro: &#36;999</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 16 Pro: &#36;999</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro: &#36;1,049?</strong></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
If the iPhone 17 Pro lacks a 128GB storage tier, some might argue that this is not a price increase anyway. In fact, &#36;1,049 would be a price decrease for the 256GB configuration. On the other hand, customers who do not want to pay more than &#36;999 for the Pro model would lose that option. This was a hotly-debated topic when Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-pricing/">dropped the 128GB tier for the Pro Max model</a> with the iPhone 15 Pro Max a few years ago.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, Apple has proven the price increase rumors wrong year after year, so it deserves the benefit of the doubt. But, nothing lasts forever. If the &#36;999 streak finally does come to an end, you can probably blame it on a combination of tariffs and higher inflation in recent years, although Apple is unlikely to mention that.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, though, it is a see-it-to-believe-it situation.<br/>
