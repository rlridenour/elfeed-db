<p>Readers may recall that in April of this year, <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/04/cancellation-of-neh-grants-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many NEH grants were cancelled</a> by Donald Trump&#8217;s administration, and grantees <a href="https://www.neh.gov/news/update-neh-funding-priorities-and-agencys-recent-implementation-trump-administration-executive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and the public</a> were told that the funds they had won were going to be repurposed &#8220;in furtherance of the President&#8217;s agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Legal challenges to this have been underway, with the Trump administration seeking dismissal of them. However, just last month <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.641679/gov.uscourts.nysd.641679.116.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a federal judge ruled</a> on First Amendment grounds that some of the grant cancellations should be put off (and the funds for them should not be otherwise spent) until the legal challenges to the cuts are heard in court:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>the Court enters a preliminary injunction in </em>Authors Guild, 25cv-3923<em>, staying the April 1-3 Mass Cancellation of grants previously awarded to putative class members in that case and directing </em>pendente lite<em> that any funds associated with those grants not be re-obligated until trial on the merits. The reason is that the class plaintiffs are likely to succeed in establishing that the class members’ grants were terminated in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act.</em></p>
<p>Though Trump has said he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/05/03/trump-budget-nea-neh-eliminate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans to eliminate the NEH</a>, the agency just <a href="https://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-3479-million-97-humanities-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> nearly $35 million in grants.</p>
