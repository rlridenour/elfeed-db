<p>In the latest development, outside monitoring groups say deaths linked to Iran’s nationwide protests and security crackdown have risen into the mid-thousands, while Iran’s authorities have offered limited public acknowledgment without a detailed official tally. Reports describe a near-total communications shutdown that has made independent verification difficult, though some contact with the outside world has intermittently resumed. The unrest began with anger over the currency’s fall and has widened into broader anti-government demonstrations and calls for major political change. The crisis has also pulled in regional and international diplomacy, with Tehran engaging U.S.-allied states as President Donald Trump publicly urged protesters to continue and warned of possible U.S. action under certain conditions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8wz8hB7iGOs74jhNs3sQp7R1kyqaigxLjOu2tmhs7SWii2Ni7OgMn1GxawUTc7D7Y5X-HpmMV4MdvLQBXTu0Xf-fdno9y6QKv5BxVNCUSyysjq3eRoNXLRcefBTeG4wuGnMGSgzQ226q0xhKZRrjgc6Uh9fTMmNmJRglcG3WPXz2-kNHsvfRZezPtPKNs_yfBlAY6zETzYAhWrNk' alt='An image taken from social media and verified by The New York Times shows people looking for relatives as bodies piled up outside Tehran’s forensics laboratory on Sunday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Shoot-to-kill claims: Witness accounts and reporting describe security forces firing on unarmed demonstrators, alongside claims from a senior Health Ministry official that the death toll could be around 3,000.</li><li>Higher estimates: Some reporting cites far higher death-toll fears—over 12,000 and potentially more—based on information said to be emerging from inside Iran during the blackout.</li><li>Foreign blame: Iranian officials have accused the United States and Israel of fueling the violence and have blamed deaths on what they call “terrorist operatives” receiving foreign guidance, while also publicly alleging foreign intelligence involvement.</li><li>Digital lifelines: With internet access heavily restricted, Iranians have used landline phone calls and smuggled satellite equipment—including Starlink devices—to get information out, even as authorities try to jam signals and pursue users.</li><li>Leadership outlook: Analysis in some coverage suggests Iran’s leadership may endure the immediate unrest, but the protests have revealed deep, ongoing public anger at what critics describe as a stagnant system.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>HRANA (U.S.-based rights group): HRANA has reported a death toll rising from just over 2,000 to roughly 2,600 as protests continued, describing the violence as the deadliest unrest in decades.
