Clojure Cookbook: Recipes for Functional Programming by Luke VanderHart
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
An excellent book, not only as a reference but as a learning resource. It is by no means written as a general entry point to Clojure, but provides terse, practical, fast-paced insight with just enough explanation to be as instructive as it is useful. The quality of the &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; portions means this is good for more than just copy-paste reading, while the emphasis on projects and practicality make it a pre-eminent go-to as you refine your Clojure skills.
