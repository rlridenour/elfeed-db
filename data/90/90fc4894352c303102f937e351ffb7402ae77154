Rights and press-freedom groups argue the move, alongside other pre-election restrictions, makes it harder for citizens, journalists, and observers to monitor and report on the vote.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eWyAIRTwuyKBoQfhJeN9bqXqkLsCSz1c4yHCM6lKSMN0dws21uEKsQ3Z284LwJWmqlv8Y_Dxdn_3F-FC_G6V4dF8eSKWq_-yuGQyg4T6z_9R5nLQmPo72_pkYlyY9AMkjMho-5Qa4e6F1nXJPqmlb7Y' alt='Residents travel past an electoral billboard for President Yoweri Museveni in Kampala ahead of Uganda’s 2026 general elections (Jan. 10, 2026).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Rights groups halted: Ugandan authorities ordered some rights groups to suspend election-related work ahead of polling day, according to reporting on government directives shared with civil-society organizations.</li><li>Media assaults: The Committee to Protect Journalists documented multiple incidents against journalists, including a case in which reporter Ssematimba Bwegiire was electrocuted with a stun gun and pepper-sprayed and later lost consciousness.</li><li>Heavy security presence: Reports described soldiers and other security forces deployed on streets in the run-up to voting, shaping how campaigns and public gatherings have unfolded.</li><li>Election expectations: Museveni, 81, has been widely expected to win again amid opposition complaints about pressure and state control, while challenger Bobi Wine remains a prominent rallying point for many voters.</li><li>Connectivity workarounds: The shutdown affects daily communication and business activity, and some users have sought technical workarounds to stay online as connectivity dropped.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ugandan authorities/communications regulator: Officials justified the nationwide shutdown as a measure to prevent misinformation, disinformation, and incitement during the election period.
