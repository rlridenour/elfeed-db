Apple may fix its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> failings by partnering with ChatGPT creator OpenAI or Claude creator Anthropic, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/apple-weighs-replacing-siri-s-ai-llms-with-anthropic-claude-or-openai-chatgpt">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple has been meeting with OpenAI and Anthropic to discuss a potential deal that would see a third-party large language model used as the backbone for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.<br/>

Both companies are training versions of their models that would work with Apple's Private Cloud Compute servers, and Apple is running tests, but hasn't made a final decision on whether to abandon &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. So far, Apple has found that Anthropic's AI models are the best fit for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, and Apple and Anthropic have already discussed some preliminary financial terms. Bloomberg says that Anthropic is asking for a multibillion-dollar annual fee that increases over time, which is why Apple is also considering partnering with other companies like OpenAI.<br/>

Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/21/apple-llm-siri-2026/">training a large language model</a> for a future version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, but it is no secret that Apple has been struggling with AI. Apple previewed several new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities at the June 2024 WWDC keynote and advertised the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models with the functionality, but ultimately wasn't able to develop the technology in time.<br/>
<br/>
In March, Apple said that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">delayed until 2026</a>, sparking customer outrage and spurring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/20/apple-sued-by-shareholder-over-siri-delay/">several lawsuits</a>. Apple now plans to introduce those features in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/">update to iOS 26</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's work on an LLM version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is separate from the personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that are coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>. LLM &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is planned as a follow up to the new features coming in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, and it will presumably debut in iOS 27 in the fall of 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Partnering with Anthropic or OpenAI would give Apple time to work on its own AI models while still delivering modern AI features that customers have come to expect. Apple already partners with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> users are able to have &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; pass requests on to ChatGPT for more detailed answers.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/">Apple Could Use ChatGPT or Claude to Power Siri</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-could-use-chatgpt-or-claude-to-power-siri.2459956/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
