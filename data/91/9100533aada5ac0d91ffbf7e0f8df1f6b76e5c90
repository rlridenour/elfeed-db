<blockquote>
  <p>Not a fan of that design? Well, iOS 26.1 beta 4 is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/20/ios-26-1-beta-4-adds-new-setting-to-tone-down-liquid-glass-transparency/">now
available</a>, and it introduces a new option to choose a more opaque
look for Liquid Glass. The same option is also available on Mac
and iPad.</p>

<p>You can find the new option on iPhone and iPad by going to the
Settings app and navigating to the Display &amp; Brightness menu. On
the Mac, it’s available in the “Appearance” menu in System
Settings. Here, you’ll see a new Liquid Glass menu with “Clear”
and “Tinted” options. [...]</p>

<p>It’s a binary option, so there’s no toggle or slider of any sort.
You have a choice between Liquid Glass as we’ve known it since iOS
26 was released, or a new tinted option that increases opacity and
adds more contrast. When enabled, the design applies to Liquid
Glass in Apple’s apps and elsewhere on the Mac, iPad, and iPhone.
For the iPhone and iPad specifically, it also increases opaqueness
in notifications on the Lock Screen.</p>

<p>This new toggle isn’t squirreled away in the Accessibility section of Settings. On iOS, it’s in Settings → Display &amp; Brightness, and on MacOS it’s in System Settings → Appearance. I’m trying it out on iPhone, but for the most part, I really haven’t minded the Clear appearance. Clear feels more fun. But I’m glad Apple added this setting.</p>
