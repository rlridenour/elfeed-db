Apple led global smartphone sales with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> in the third quarter of 2025 while simultaneously accelerating demand for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup and expanding its promotional footprint in the United States, according to new analyses from Counterpoint Research.<br/>

Counterpoint Research's <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/top-10-best-selling-smartphones-q3-2025">Global Monthly Handset Model Sales Tracker</a> shows that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; was the best-selling smartphone worldwide during the third quarter of 2025. Well into its second year of life, the device's sustained performance is attributed to continued demand among users upgrading from older <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> generations, expanded carrier promotions in developed markets, and the broad appeal of the standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; configuration in regions where ultra-premium models represent a smaller share of total volume.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;'s continued leadership, Counterpoint says the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> Max entered the quarterly global top-10 list and became the best-selling smartphone in September 2025, despite "limited availability towards the end of the quarter." According to the firm, demand for the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max was strengthened by a large cohort of users who purchased iPhones during the COVID-19 period and returned for major upgrades this year. New features such as a 48-megapixel telephoto camera with 8x optical zoom and a vapor-chamber cooling system represent one of Apple's most substantial year-over-year camera and thermal architecture revisions and contributed materially to monthly sales growth.<br/>
<br/>
The same dataset indicates that, while Apple maintained its position at the top of the global rankings with the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and expanded momentum with the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max, Samsung increased its presence in the top-10 list to five positions, all from the Galaxy A series. <br/>
<br/>
A separate Counterpoint <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/reports/global-foldable-smartphone-market-analysis-and-insights-q3-2025">analysis of the global foldable smartphone sector</a> shows that the premium market segment where Apple has not yet entered continued to grow at a materially faster pace than the broader industry. The firm reports that global foldable shipments increased 14% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2025, which is the highest quarterly shipment volume ever recorded for the category.<br/>
<br/>
Counterpoint attributes much of this performance to Samsung's Galaxy Z 7 series, especially the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which generated "exceptionally strong consumer response" due to a slimmer and lighter enclosure, reduced crease visibility, and an upgraded hinge mechanism designed for improved durability. While Apple has not released a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, rumors suggest that the company will debut such a device as soon as next year. <br/>

Meanwhile, Counterpoint's <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/google-led-us-pre-black-smartphone-promotions-apple-crossed-finish-line-leading">U.S. Weekly Smartphone Promotions Index</a> shows that Apple intensified its promotional activity in response to unusually early and aggressive Pixel 10 discounts led by Google. Apple finished the period overtaking Google. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/">Counterpoint</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/iphone-16-was-best-selling-smartphone/">iPhone 16 Was World&#039;s Best-Selling Smartphone in Q3 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-was-worlds-best-selling-smartphone-in-q3-2025.2474373/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
