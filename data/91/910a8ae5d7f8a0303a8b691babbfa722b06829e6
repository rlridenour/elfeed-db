<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking more in depth about the issues on my Linux desktop, and so far I managed to fix two things.</p>
<p>First, there was the issue the computer would take about a minute to shutdown. Systemd was waiting on a process to respond, and it didn&rsquo;t. It seemed that disconnecting from my old Mac Mini, which I keep online mostly for storage, resolved this problem—no more hang-ups.</p>
<p>The second issue, which is Emacs-specific, was the result of my laziness: I installed Emacs from a flatpak (I know, I know, what was I thinking). As a result, a few things didn&rsquo;t work right. After installing it from savannah.gnu.org as I should and building it, it works as it should&hellip; kind of. There&rsquo;s still the odd font issue where it doesn&rsquo;t pick up italics, but I think I have a workaround.</p>
<p>Next, I need to clean a couple of libraries that are taking up space on my hard drive, and probably a few more games I&rsquo;m not really playing. First, I need to have a good backup.</p>
