<p>The European Union and the Mercosur bloc of South American countries formally signed a long-negotiated free trade agreement on Saturday in Asuncion, Paraguay, after talks that stretched for more than 25 years. Leaders presented the pact as a vote of confidence in open trade at a time of global protectionism and tariff tensions, with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen framing it as a stabilizing response to a more unsettled trade environment. The signing also surfaced political and social fault lines: some European farmers object to increased agricultural imports, while Mercosur leaders appeared with different levels of enthusiasm and representation at the ceremony.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/WeOzo_FxiNaApg6Dtgt7caR2y5fDpfz7kGis6tnB4ty0t4McVBjEBhymB3DrLVvKJwBl_zd8wzWNRviI3548bJcsAnzRJnhuf4OS6G4BpWaVyBd4dhMXQnk_WApxaUB5bnRFev-tDEnSI96_bKjAIJYHcZzpcNiAvkzJzn_0t0yYQ_8E4ZZZN5ui2hEndte1aQA_iJBkLUx_QwkjpVmGI-Gcuhhp61J3QZiqNX1lD6Fs5yKl3xjS7w26F3_ckB5iy6DE2EE' alt='EU and Mercosur representatives attend the signing ceremony in Asuncion, Paraguay.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who showed up: Argentina’s President Javier Milei attended the ceremony, while Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva did not and was represented by his foreign minister, according to Mercosur-focused coverage.</li><li>Farm sector pushback: German media reporting noted opposition from some European farmers, reflecting concern about competition from South American agricultural producers.</li><li>Tariff backdrop: South American and European leaders described the pact as a “clear signal” in the face of worries about tariffs and isolationism in global trade.</li><li>US policy context: Von der Leyen portrayed the agreement as a bulwark against trade disruption linked to the policies of President Trump’s administration.</li><li>Scale claim: DW described the agreement as creating one of the world’s largest free trade zones, underscoring its reach beyond the two regions.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Commission leadership: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented the agreement as a way to strengthen commercial ties and reduce vulnerability amid rising protectionism and global trade tensions, including trade disruption she linked to President Trump’s administration.
