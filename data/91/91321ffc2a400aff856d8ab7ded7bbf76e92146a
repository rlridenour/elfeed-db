Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/introducing-disappearing-posts-on-threads/">today announced</a> that the Threads social network is gaining support for disappearing posts. "Ghost posts" are Threads posts that will be automatically archived after a 24-hour period.<br/>

Replies to ghost posts are sent to the user's direct message inbox, with no comments or likes shared publicly. Creating a ghost post can be done by tapping on the new ghost icon that's available when composing a post.<br/>
<br/>
Ghost posts appear as a chat bubble with a gray background in the Threads feed, so they stand out compared to regular posts.<br/>
<br/>
Meta says that the feature will allow Threads users to share "unfiltered thoughts and fresh takes without the pressure of permanence or polish." Ghost posts are available now.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/threads/">Threads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/27/threads-ghost-posts/">Threads Now Supports Disappearing &#039;Ghost Posts&#039; That Archive After 24 Hours</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-now-supports-disappearing-ghost-posts-that-archive-after-24-hours.2469934/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
