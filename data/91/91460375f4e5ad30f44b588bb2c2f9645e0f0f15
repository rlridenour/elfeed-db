<p><strong>Piezo</strong>&nbsp;is the simplest way to record audio on your Mac. With its one-click interface, you can capture audio from any app or input device. It&#8217;s perfect for recording Zoom calls, streaming audio, or just making some quick voice notes. There&#8217;s no complicated setup: hit record and you’re set.</p>



<p>If you want even more power,&nbsp;<strong>Audio Hijack</strong>&nbsp;is the ultimate audio recording tool for Mac. Capture audio from any app or device on your Mac including the whole system audio, and apply real-time effects. You can schedule recordings for live streams, and even transcribe your audio. It’s all handled in a beautiful and intuitive design. Whether you’re a podcaster, teacher, or just want total control over your Mac’s audio, Audio Hijack has you covered.</p>



<p>I use Audio Hijack daily. My wife uses Piezo to record audio on her Mac. Not sure which to choose? Both apps offer free and fully functional trials, so you can try them out before you buy. And as a MacSparky reader, you can save 20% on these and any Rogue Amoeba purchase through the end of June. Just use coupon code&nbsp;<strong>SPARKYRECORDS</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/store/?utm_source=macsparky&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MacSparky-2506">on their online store</a>.</p>
