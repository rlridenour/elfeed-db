Apple is designing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/techwoven-cases-crossbody-strap-rumor/">new "TechWoven" cases</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, with photos of <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/new-techwoven-case-colors-for-iphone-17-revealed/">some of the alleged case colors</a> shared today by leaker Majin Bu.<br/>

The cases feature a muted, fabric design in colors that appear to include black, blue, green, purple, and orange. The TechWoven cases will reportedly replace the fabric-like FineWoven cases<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-discontinues-finewoven-cases/">that Apple discontinued</a> with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> launch. The FineWoven cases were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">not popular with customers</a> due to their penchant for staining and issues with durability. The fabric of the TechWoven case has supposedly been "redesigned for greater durability."<br/>
<br/>
Majin Bu claims that the cases will include metallic buttons with "improved tactile feedback," a Camera Control button, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> compatibility, and two small holes at the bottom for attaching a crossbody strap or accessories. The cases appear to be for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models that are rumored to have a horizontal camera bar given the size of the camera cutout, but Bu says the TechWoven cases will be available for all of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models. <br/>
