Following its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/wwdc-2025-live-coverage/">WWDC keynote</a> on Monday, Apple updated a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment">developer document</a> to indicate that Rosetta 2 will remain available through macOS 27.<br/>

Rosetta 2 enables Macs with Apple silicon (Arm architecture) to run apps that were built for Macs with an Intel processor (x86 architecture), by translating code.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with macOS 28, Apple said that only a limited version of Rosetta 2 will remain available for older games that rely on Intel-based frameworks:<blockquote>Rosetta was designed to make the transition to Apple silicon easier, and we plan to make it available for the next two major macOS releases – through macOS 27 – as a general-purpose tool for Intel apps to help developers complete the migration of their apps. Beyond this timeframe, we will keep a subset of Rosetta functionality aimed at supporting older unmaintained gaming titles, that rely on Intel-based frameworks.</blockquote>The document also reiterates that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/intel-macs-no-more-updates/">macOS Tahoe will be the final macOS release that supports Intel-based Macs</a>. However, Apple said that Intel-based Macs will continue to receive security updates for an additional three years.<br/>
<br/>
macOS Tahoe is compatible with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/macos-tahoe-compatible-macs/">only a handful of Intel-based Macs</a>, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro (2019), 13-inch MacBook Pro (2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports), 27-inch iMac (2020), and Mac Pro (2019).<br/>
<br/>
macOS 28 will be released in 2027.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/">Intel</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rosetta/">Rosetta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-to-phase-out-rosetta-2/">Apple to Phase Out Rosetta 2 Starting With macOS 28 as Intel Era Ends</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-phase-out-rosetta-2-starting-with-macos-28-as-intel-era-ends.2458631/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
