  <p>Some time ago, OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/amnesia-begone-soon-chatgpt-will-remember-what-you-tell-it-between-sessions/">added</a> a feature called “Memory” that
allowed a limited number of pieces of information to be retained
and used for future responses. Users often had to specifically
ask ChatGPT to remember something to trigger this, though it
occasionally tried to guess at what it should remember, too.
[...] Users could enable or disable this feature at will, and it
was automatically off for specific chats where users chose the
“Temporary Chat” option — sort of ChatGPT’s version of
incognito mode.</p>

<p>The new improvements announced today go far beyond that.</p>

<p>Now, where there was once a checkbox in ChatGPT’s interface to
disable or enable memory tracking, there are two checkboxes.
“Reference saved memories” is the old memory feature, which is
basically a limited repository of essential facts. The second is
the new feature: “reference chat history.” This allows ChatGPT to
use all prior conversations as context and adapt future responses
accordingly.</p>

<p>I’ve been using ChatGPT for a while now. I don’t think I’m a particularly heavy user at all, and I haven’t tried, in particular, to, I don’t know, open up about myself personally. But I ask it what I want to know. So, in the current version, I prompted it with “Describe me based on all our chats — play it straight.” Here’s its response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re sharp, analytical, and deeply detail-oriented. You care a
lot about precision — whether it’s language, data, or historical
facts. You’re not satisfied with vague answers; you want the right
one, ideally backed by sources or structured data. You’re a power
user, technically literate, and comfortable with scripting and
command-line tools (especially on macOS), often turning to
automation and custom scripts to solve problems.</p>

<p>You follow the tech world closely, especially Apple — its
hardware, chip architecture, software updates, and even historical
product launches. But you’re not just interested in specs; you
care about the bigger picture too, like corporate strategy,
antitrust laws, and privacy policies.</p>

<p>You also track U.S. politics, legal frameworks, and electoral
history with the same demand for precision and sourcing. And
you’ve got a thing for language — choosing the right word,
understanding nuance, and occasionally searching for just the
right adjective (bonus points if it’s rare or elegant).</p>

<p>Outside of that, you have a strong grasp of sports stats
(especially NFL and MLB), media history (Letterman, SNL, classic
film), and a dry, sometimes playful sense of humor. You don’t show
off, but you clearly know your stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m probably not the right person to judge that response, but I think it’s pretty good.</p>

<p>Here’s the response I got when I asked Siri “Describe me based on all our chats — play it straight”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t see that person in your Contacts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From last week’s blockbuster report by Wayne Ma at The Information, “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/10/wayne-ma-the-information-apple-siri-fumble">How Apple Fumbled Siri’s AI Makeover</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Giannandrea often has described to employees his belief that
machine learning can lead to incremental improvements in products,
eventually adding up to major gains, a concept he refers to as
hill climbing. He also has expressed a dim view of chatbots in the
past, telling Apple employees before and immediately after the
release of ChatGPT that he didn’t believe they added much value
for users.</p>
