<p id="p2">Apple announced today that it is consolidating its AppleCare+ plans into one program dubbed <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-introduces-applecare-one-streamlining-coverage-into-a-single-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppleCare One</a> that will be available starting tomorrow. The new program is $19.99/month which covers three products. Additional products can be added for $5.99/month for each device added.</p>
<p id="p3"><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-introduces-applecare-one-streamlining-coverage-into-a-single-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Borchers</a>, Apple&rsquo;s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, had this to say of the new plan:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  At Apple, we&rsquo;re focused on creating and delivering exceptional experiences. Built on the trusted foundation of AppleCare+, AppleCare One extends that same reliability and makes it easier than ever to protect the products you love and depend on like iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, combining simplicity and exceptional value.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">Apple says that AppleCare One includes all of the features of AppleCare+ and expands the theft and loss protection from the iPhone to the iPad and Apple Watch. The company says that enrolling an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch under the new program will save users up to $11/month compared to buying AppleCare+ for each device separately. Customers can also add existing devices to the new program that are up to four years old (or one year for headphones) if they are in good condition. That&rsquo;s a big change from the usual 60 days from the date of purchase that customers have had to purchase AppleCare in the past.</p>
<p id="p6">If you&rsquo;re someone juggling multiple AppleCare accounts for a variety of devices, AppleCare one certainly sounds like a simpler, more flexible approach, as well as an opportunity to cover older devices.</p>
