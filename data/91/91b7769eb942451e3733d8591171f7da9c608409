 
          <p>Emberheart&rsquo;s recent <a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/games/pc/wizordum/">Wizordum</a> rekindled my interest in retro-inspired First Person Shooters (FPS) also known as <em>boomer shooters</em>. Some are offended by the term, but I quite like it: it not only denotes the <em>DOOM</em> clones of the early nineties as the boomer generation of FPS gaming but also perfectly defines what a boomer shooter is: things that go <em>boom</em>. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>And boy, do things go boom in these games, thanks to the crazy amount of weaponry at the player&rsquo;s disposal. Combine that with emphasis on movement and speed&mdash;remember circle strafing? That&rsquo;s just the bare minimum now&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve got yourself a hundred different ways to murder, shred, and rip your enemies apart. To stay true to their <em>DOOM</em> roots, boomer shooters are usually a bloody affair.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated with the shotguns in these games: the rapid BOOM TSJK BOOM TSJK BOOM TSJK of <em>Quake</em>, the heavy KABOOM click clack KABOOM click clack of the super shotgun in <em>DOOM II</em>. Somehow along the way, the shotgun (and double barrel one) became an indispensable part of any boomer shooter. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;d like to take a closer look at the craziness involved in these retro-inspired shooters. Or more specifically, what&rsquo;s bound behind key number 3. Assuming 1 is the melee weapon and 2 is the pistol, of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to talk about shotguns in shooters without mentioning <em>DOOM</em>&mdash;which I already did three times, but they, one more time can&rsquo;t hurt. In 1993, id Software not only started the gory Binary Space Partitioning revolution, but also iterated on <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>&rsquo;s rather boring weaponry line-up: the pistol, the automatic rifle, and the mini gun. <em>DOOM</em> gave us a plethora of new stuff to play with, including some sweet sweet pump action.</p>
<p>Yet that digitized child toy won at fairs can hardly be called crazy by modern standards. Enter <em>DOOM II</em>&rsquo;s double barrel &ldquo;super&rdquo; shotgun: double the barrels, double the fun! Thirty-one years later, those two barrels still pack a mighty punch, up to the point that most other weapons in the game are obsolete. According to various <a href="https://www.doom2.net/single/weaponfaq.html#weapont">weapon damage tables</a>, the super shotgun has a mean damage output of as much as the rocket launcher!</p>

<p>The deep sound that accompanies the shotgun is still an instant nostalgia trigger. You&rsquo;ll immediately recognize it. Let&rsquo;s put it to the test: for this article, I randomly compiled 11 different shotgun sounds into a single audio file. It&rsquo;s up to you to identify the games and shotguns:</p>
<div class="video-mask">
	<audio width="100%" controls preload="metadata">

	  Your browser does not support HTML audio. Here's a link to the MP3-encoded audio instead: <a href="/audio/shotgunsounds.mp3">/audio/shotgunsounds.mp3</a>.

<p>If that&rsquo;s too difficult for you, the following hint will spoil the games but not the order:</p>
<details class="spoiler">
  <summary>(Spoilers)</summary>
  <ul>
<li>DOOM II (obviously)</li>
<li>DOOM Eternal</li>
<li>DUSK (2x)</li>
<li>Outlaws (2x)</li>
<li>Prodeus</li>
<li>Project Warlock</li>
<li>Quake</li>
<li>Redneck Rampage</li>
<li>Serious Sam</li>
</ul>

</details>

<p>So where do you go from there? What can possibly topple <em>DOOM II</em>&rsquo;s super shotgun? Nothing, really, but developers have been giving it a damn good try since then anyway. There are quite a few almost as iconic double barrel shotguns. In <em>DUSK</em>, we see the protagonist getting attached to their favourite killing machine. When it&rsquo;s temporarily taken away and then returned a few levels later, we whisper <em>welcome back, friend</em>, lovingly stroke its long barrels, and happily resume the rampage. In <em>Serous Sam</em>, the BOOM sound the weapon emits is almost as majestic as the huge open spaces between the pyramids that are infested with AAAAAAAAAHHHH screaming beheaded kamikazes.</p>
<p>How about reskinning the shotgun into a crossbow firing three green projectiles (<em>Heretic</em>)? Not cool enough? Okay, I get it, we need to step up our game.</p>
<p>How about modding our double barrels? Sawing them off, perhaps? In <em>Outlaws</em>, there are three (!) shotguns mapped to your keypads: a single barrel, a double barrel, and a sawn-off one, although to this day I am puzzled by the difference in function as they even sound alike. In <em>Project Warlock</em>, being a more modern retro-inspired shooter, you can upgrade your weapons after collecting enough skill points. That single barrel can become an automatic and that double barrel lovingly called the Boom Stick can gain alternate firing modes.</p>

<p>Speaking of mods, <em>DOOM Eternal</em>&rsquo;s super shotgun Meat Hook attachment is one of the most genius ideas ever: pulling yourself closer to your enemies before unloading those two barrels ups the fun (and gore) dramatically. I believe you can also inject incendiary rounds. In <em>DOOM 2016</em>, you can tinker with your shotgun by swapping out pieces. Tadaa, now it&rsquo;s a shotgun gatling gun!</p>
<p>Still not crazy enough, I hear ya. What about <em>Forgive Me Father</em> then, where the unlocked upgrades gradually push more and more crazy (literally) into the weapon designs by merging with the Cthulhu mythos. The Abyssal Shotgun features more bullets per shot and has an increased firing speed, essentially making it an automatic double barrel?</p>
<p>What about dual wielding instead? In <em>DUSK</em>, beyond the trusty double barrel, you can dual wield two regular shotguns and pump out that lead at a demonic speed (no wait wrong game). In <em>Nightmare Reaper</em>, the reflection power-up allows you to temporarily dual wield your current load-out that can already be pretty wild as the modifiers are random. I saw someone unloading 100+ shots at once. How&rsquo;s that for a boomer shooter. The idea is not new though: <em>Blood</em> allowed us to temporarily dual wield sawn-off shotguns in as early as 1997.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not impressive enough, <em>F.E.A.R.</em> not (get it?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>): if two barrels aren&rsquo;t enough, then how about three instead? The game <em>INCISION</em> will congratulate you with the message &ldquo;Ludicrous Gibs!!&rdquo; after firing off that bad boy. But we can do even better: the hand cannon in <em>Prodeus</em> features a whopping four barrels that can be fired individually or all at once, turning anything on screen into ketchup. KABOOM click clack.</p>
<p>I first thought <em>Prodeus</em> invented that but <em>Shadow Warrior</em>&mdash;yet another crazy Build Engine game from 1997 with even crazier weapons&mdash;technically already featured a four-barreled shotgun that rapidly rotates as you shoot. I don&rsquo;t think you can unload everything at once though. Or how about another rotating barrel that can also eject grenades? That&rsquo;s Shelly&rsquo;s Disperser from <em>Ion Fury</em>. Guess what, <em>Ion Fury</em> runs on the Build Engine. No coincidence there.</p>

<p>But perhaps the craziest of them all must be the projectile boosting mechanic in <em>ULTRAKILL</em>: after firing off those shotgun shells, you can hit them with your fists to increase their speed? I have no idea how that works. I skipped that game because the trailers induced motion sickness. I can tolerate a crazy amount of crazy but that&rsquo;s a bit too much.</p>
<p>From a pump action toy to a boom stick, quad shotgun, rapid firing abyssal shotgun or disperser. From a regular buckshot shell to incendiary rounds, grenades, and meat hooks. I love these kinds of games because they have the creative freedom to bend all the rules&mdash;especially when it comes to the weaponry.</p>
<p>And yet, we stay true to our <em>DOOM-like</em> roots: you can&rsquo;t release a successful retro-inspired shooter without the presence of a (super) shotgun.</p>
