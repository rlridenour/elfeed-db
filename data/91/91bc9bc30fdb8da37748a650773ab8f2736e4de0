A handful of Apple products are expected to be updated as early as October, with the following new features and changes rumored:<ul>  <li><strong>iPad Pro:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">M5 chip</a> and potentially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">two front cameras</a>, allowing for photos and video calls in both portrait and landscape orientations.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Vision Pro:</strong> A faster <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/apple-vision-pro-2025-features/">M4 chip</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-code-confirms-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">M5 chip</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/apple-vision-pro-2025-features/">a new head strap</a> that improves comfort, and potentially a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/05/new-homepod-mini-vision-pro-colors-rumored/">Space Black color option</a>.</li><li><strong>Apple TV:</strong> A faster <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/">A17 Pro chip</a> that will support next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/tim-cook-shares-personalized-siri-update/">revamped version of Siri</a> powered by Apple Intelligence, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">likely</a> Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-n1-chip/">N1 chip with Wi-Fi 7 support</a>. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">built-in FaceTime camera</a> has been rumored for a future Apple TV, but it is unclear if that will arrive with the next model specifically.</li><br/>
<li><strong>HomePod mini:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/homepod-mini-new-chip/">S9 chip or newer</a> with support for next year's revamped version of Siri powered by Apple Intelligence, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">likely</a> Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-n1-chip/">N1 chip with Wi-Fi 7 support</a>, improved sound quality, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip for proximity features, and potentially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/05/new-homepod-mini-vision-pro-colors-rumored/">new color options like Red</a>.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>AirTag:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/airtag-2-longer-range-rumor/">Up to 3× longer item tracking range</a> vs. current AirTag, a more tamper-proof speaker, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/25/airtag-2-september-or-later-rumor/">"very low" battery life alerts</a>.</li></ul>What about Macs? Apple's next 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max chips will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/28/next-macbook-pro-nears-mass-production-report/">reportedly enter mass production soon</a>, but they apparently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/">might not be announced until early 2026</a>. While new Macs are often unveiled in October, there is precedent for a launch earlier in a year too, as Apple announced MacBook Pro models with M2 Pro and M2 Max chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-announces-m2-pro-macbook-pro/">in a January 2023 press release</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is reportedly also planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/18/lower-cost-macbook-a18-pro-or-a19-pro/">lower-priced MacBook with an A18 Pro or A19 Pro chip</a>, but the rumored launch timeframe for that is late 2025 or early 2026, so it is unclear if it would be announced this October. This model would likely be the spiritual successor to the MacBook Air with an M1 chip, which is still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-599-at-walmart/">sold by Walmart in the U.S. for &#36;599</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple recently announced its next quarterly earnings call will be held <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">on Thursday, October 30</a>, so any new products this month will likely be unveiled by Wednesday, October 29 at the latest, so Apple can recap the announcements on the call.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/03/when-might-apple-announce-october-event/">When Would Apple Announce an October Event This Year?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-would-apple-announce-an-october-event-this-year.2468293/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
