<p>A sweeping winter storm is pushing across much of the United States, bringing snow, freezing rain and extreme cold and triggering widespread weather alerts affecting more than 210 million people. Forecasters warned the system could create a “catastrophic” ice band from east Texas toward North Carolina, with travel becoming dangerous and power disruptions possible, especially in areas less used to intense winter weather. The storm has already disrupted air travel, with thousands of flights canceled, and multiple states issuing emergency steps or urging residents to stay off roads. While the situation is serious, early preparation messages and emergency declarations aim to reduce injuries and keep communities safer as the storm advances.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/XwMSEl97a39m28i3Jkcp7cFhn00bRfYqZs29ckn00D2OwnIs6axumDs6kslbc--_IjpH8bVO9_g5kcu30r_K97L8sneBJ8W0GTg3AN7eAmpGhPriRMO9-NLrWURFtBBGzcqdLRgNAk3CTPO8rqiKoV2lS501VqJbFql-WRl9jr8bfjiG5msVSDCEbbhnXieu' alt='Winter weather and travel disruptions build as a storm approaches large parts of the US.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Flights disrupted: Airlines have scrapped large volumes of service as the storm approaches, with reports ranging from more than 2,700 weekend cancellations to over 8,000 total cancellations in the period covered.</li><li>Ice corridor: The National Weather Service warned of potentially “catastrophic ice accumulation,” with risks including long-duration outages, extensive tree damage and impassable roads.</li><li>Cold danger: Forecasters emphasized health risks, warning the cold could pose a “life-threatening risk of hypothermia” for people exposed for long periods.</li><li>States respond: Officials in more than a dozen states have declared emergencies or issued strong guidance to stay home to reduce road crashes and speed up response operations.</li><li>Political side note: President Trump publicly mocked climate activists ahead of the storm, using the weather event to question global warming claims.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>National Weather Service: Forecasters warned of extremely dangerous conditions including hypothermia risk and potentially catastrophic ice impacts, urging precautions and limiting travel where possible.
