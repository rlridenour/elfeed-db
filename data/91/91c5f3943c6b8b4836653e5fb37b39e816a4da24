<p>President Trump hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House on Tuesday, presiding over a ceremonial welcome and a black‑tie dinner while praising the prince and the bilateral relationship. The visit produced a U.S. agreement to sell F‑35 fighter jets, a civil nuclear cooperation declaration and an announcement that Riyadh would increase U.S. investment commitments to nearly $1 trillion, according to officials and the two governments. Mr. Trump also announced he would designate Saudi Arabia a major non‑NATO ally and publicly dismissed U.S. intelligence findings about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying the crown prince &quot;knew nothing&quot; and that &quot;things happened&quot; when asked by reporters.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/rODAXFA0LkILcvPFtOwItG9PKUw3OaR0hbe2jmmzL542OxUPU39haQB94VXsNXmCpjFqOYBaJhkWxlT1grgLeokTS13YgMGOajhELjyN740KOej-Hei8ZUxvlr_NY3FdrxYmRUigdO_41zhsjh4PkkBZePkL9TOFbjWPoN1SztJLPkNgjVFX9SUIDdZBro1bcRSxV8lMns_EWw' alt='President Trump and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince and prime minister of Saudi Arabia, in the Oval Office on Tuesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Intelligence contradiction: U.S. intelligence officials previously assessed the crown prince likely approved the 2018 operation that killed Jamal Khashoggi, a finding President Trump publicly contradicted during the visit.</li><li>Ally status details: The designation as a major non‑NATO ally will ease weapons transfers and join Saudi Arabia with 19 other countries that hold the status, according to U.S. announcements and reporting.</li><li>Defense concerns: Officials and analysts warned the planned F‑35 sale risks technology transfer to third parties and could complicate Israel’s qualitative military edge, concerns noted by multiple outlets.</li><li>Elite dinner guests: The White House dinner drew high‑profile private sector figures including Elon Musk, Apple’s Tim Cook and Cristiano Ronaldo, underscoring business interest in Saudi deals.</li></ul><blockquote>You&#x27;re mentioning someone that was extremely controversial.
