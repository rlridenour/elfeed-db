 
          <p>This year&rsquo;s announcement of autumn, <a href="/post/2025/10/spiel-essen-2025">SPIEL Essen</a>, Halloween, and the daylight saving time switch are already officially behind us. 2025 has only two months left: I see people starting heated debates on the upcoming <em>Game of the Year</em> awards and I see people planning their Christmas home decorations&mdash;for some strange reason earlier every year. We went mushroom spotting in the woods with the kids a couple of weeks ago which seemed like a fitting October thing to do. I have a decade old mushroom identification guide lying around that always manages to induce more confusion than it solves but we had great fun nonetheless.</p>
<p>Previous month: <a href="/post/2025/10/september-2025">September 2025</a>.</p>
<h2 id="books-ive-read">Books I&rsquo;ve read</h2>
<p>This is getting embarrassing. Maybe I should simply omit this section in future monthly overview posts? I&rsquo;ve managed to read a few pages from the two <a href="https://senetmagazine.com/">Senet Magazine</a> issues I ordered (issue <code>#19</code> and <code>#20</code>) after seeing someone on Mastodon boast about theirs. Senet is a pretty sizeable independent print magazine on all things board games that is easy to recommend to cardboard fans.</p>
<h2 id="games-ive-played">Games I&rsquo;ve played</h2>
<p>I managed to finish three short games:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/games/pc/wizordum/">Wizordum</a>, a bright and blocky throwback shooter that&rsquo;s a cross between <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> and <em>Heretic</em>. It&rsquo;s a fun diversion that doesn&rsquo;t stand out from the increasingly busy indie boomer shooter crowd.</li>
<li><a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/games/switch/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap/">Wonder Boy: The Dragon&rsquo;s Trap</a>, the 2017 remake built on top of the 1989 Sega Master System original that helped pioneer the Metroidvania mechanics of gradually unlocking new powers and backtracking through levels. It still holds up remarkably well and the new lick of paint is beautifully applied.</li>
<li><a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/games/pc/halloween-harry/">Halloween Harry</a> (or rather, <em>Alien Carnage</em>) was the DOS Game Club&rsquo;s game of the month. I played this one back in 1994 but didn&rsquo;t really get into it and now I can see why. It&rsquo;s average at best thanks to typical mediocre DOS platform jank such as cheap enemy placement, hit boxes that clip through stairs and shitty controls. But at least now I can say to my younger self that it was good to have skimped over this one.</li>
</ul>
<p>A week after finishing <em>Wizordum</em>, Limited Run Games happened to have <em>Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition</em> stock left in their vault. Since <em>Wizordum</em> got me back into the retro shooters vibe, I figured why not. The <em>Turok</em> trilogy is another one I&rsquo;m currently eyeing at.</p>
<p>For those suckers like me who buy physical Switch games, I didn&rsquo;t know the scene was that weird and scattered: here&rsquo;s AntDude Plus on YouTube revealing some of the quirks:</p>

<p>As for board games, nothing except the try-outs at the <em>SPIEL</em> fair&hellip; October was a pretty rough month in terms of spare time.</p>

<li>This older post by Joe Siegler on <a href="https://joesiegler.blog/2014/12/happy-20th-rise-of-the-triad/">the history of Rise of the Triad</a> was very educational on how the game&rsquo;s concepts came to be as Joe himself was part of the development team.</li>
<li>Harvard University published <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/generational-data-interviews/">Generational Data Interviews</a> on digital preservation. They asked 14 people the same question: <em>If you were given unlimited funding to design a system for storing and preserving digital information for at least a century, what would you do?</em></li>

<h2 id="other-random-links">Other random links</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://amiga.lychesis.net/">Amiga Graphics Archive</a> is awesome.</li>
<li>A new <em>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</em> game is in the making called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/">Olden Era</a>! It looks beautiful, hopefully it manages to retain most of what made <em>III</em> so great.</li>
<li><a href="https://sounds.spriters-resource.com/ms_dos/">The Sounds Resource</a> is a handy site where you can download specific sound clips of old games. This is where I got that <em>Redneck Rampage</em> shotgun sound from as I no longer own a copy of the game.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s an interesting thread on ResetERA on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/blobbers-1st-person-dungeon-crawlers-dungeon-rpgs-classic-rpgs.804717/page-11">dungeon crawling RPGs</a> or &ldquo;blobbers&rdquo; where I picked up the little indie game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010290/Heroes_of_the_Seven_Islands/">Heroes of the Seven Islands</a> that&rsquo;s inspired by <em>Might &amp; Magic VI(I)</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://ratfactor.com/faceclick/index">Faceclick</a> is a lightweight Emoji picker with keyword search I don&rsquo;t need because I use a handy <em>Alfred</em> plug-in and try to avoid Emoji usage like the plague but it might be of use to others.</li>
<li>I might be needing this in the near future: <a href="https://wizardry.fasterthoughts.io/strategies/combat-strategies/">Wizardry Combat Strategies</a> for the original AppleII/Digital Eclipse remaster. The menu font when in Switch handheld mode is annoyingly small though.</li>
<li>Did you know that next to the traditional shareware model, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware#Postcardware">postcardware</a> also exists? Aaron Giles, the creator, scanned everything he received and put them up at <a href="https://postcardware.net/">https://postcardware.net/</a>.</li>
