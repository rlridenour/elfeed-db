Most of emacs is miraculously self-documenting but I found a bare-spot: how to customize emacs notifications. In particular, being an exwm user the in-emacs mini-buffer with Dunst, I hope. There&rsquo;s a dirth of documentation on the appointment variables/functions, although they are emacs-general. In particular, the key to making this whole thing work, appt-disp-window-function, has no help entry in my emacs, but this does it on my Linux:
Solution Code (setq appt-display-format &#39;window) (setq appt-disp-window-function (function tsa/appt-disp-window)) (defun tsa/appt-disp-window (min-to-app new-time msg) (save-window-excursion (shell-command (concat &#34;notify-send \&#34;Orgmode: &#34; msg &#34;\&#34;&#34;) nil nil))) Resources  Relevant source: https://www.
