<p id="p3"><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Cook had this to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  Today Apple is proud to report a June quarter revenue record with double-digit growth in iPhone, Mac and Services and growth around the world, in every geographic segment. At WWDC25, we were excited to introduce a beautiful new software design that extends across all of our platforms, and we announced even more great Apple Intelligence features.

<p id="p5">Going into today&rsquo;s earnings, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-earnings-under-pressure-tariffs-slow-ai-roll-out-2025-07-30/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters reported</a> that the Wall Street consensus was for 4.2% growth in revenue to $89.34 billion, reflecting ongoing concerns over tariffs and the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence features.</p>
<p id="p6">Today&rsquo;s results are substantially better than expected, led by double-digit gains for iPhone, Mac, and Services sales. Apple&rsquo;s board of directors has authorized a $0.26/share dividend, too.</p>
