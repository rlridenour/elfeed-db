<blockquote>
  <p>The Apple card is up for grabs because Goldman Sachs, the bank
behind it, is getting out of the consumer lending world. For
months, big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Synchrony Financial
have been vying to take over as issuer. What hasn’t been known is
the equally fierce fight playing out between the networks to win
Apple, with Visa and American Express trying to unseat Mastercard,
according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Apple is expected to select a network for the card before it picks
the bank to replace Goldman Sachs. Networks provide the plumbing
that transmit information between the banks that issue consumers’
cards and the merchants’ banks.</p>

<p>Visa, the largest network, has made an aggressive pitch to win the
card, including offering the kind of upfront payment to Apple
that’s normally reserved for the biggest card programs, the people
said. Visa offered a similar payment when Costco was selecting its
network about a decade ago, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p>

<p>American Express is also in the mix, trying to become both the
issuer and network of the Apple card, the people said. Goldman had
approached Amex to gauge its interest in taking over the card in
2023, the Journal earlier reported.</p>

<p>I’ve always thought Visa and Mastercard were interchangeable. I can’t recall ever once in my life seeing an establishment where one of them was accepted but the other wasn’t, and they both seem to be accepted everywhere that accepts credit cards at all. If there’s a reason to prefer one over the other I’ve never heard it.</p>

<p>Amex is different because it’s accepted at fewer locations because they charge merchants a higher fee, which they get away with because they offer their customers superior service. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/goldman-apple-card-losses">I wrote back in 2023</a> that they share an affinity with Apple: both are built around the idea of offering a premium experience and charging higher prices for it.</p>

<p>But I already have a regular Amex card. One of the things I like about Apple Card being a Mastercard (or if they switched to Visa) is that it’s a card I can use anywhere that doesn’t accept Amex.</p>
