<p>A court in Peru has sentenced former president Martín Vizcarra to 14 years in prison after finding he accepted bribes from construction companies while serving as regional governor of the southern region of Moquegua between 2011 and 2014. Judges concluded that Vizcarra received illicit payments from firms involved in major public works contracts, years before he rose to the presidency in 2018. The ruling adds him to a series of former Peruvian leaders who have been convicted or investigated over corruption, reflecting both the depth of past graft and the determination of courts and prosecutors to pursue cases against powerful figures. Vizcarra, who had portrayed himself nationally as an anti‑corruption reformer during his time in office, was taken into custody immediately after the verdict, though his legal team can still pursue appeals under Peruvian law.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/V0LldruT2h-59kIIJcm3Nz1h2sHjSrCUwpeA__bguE5f_24EAvRZF1iakB9m67s9BBs3K3V33gjHFNvk_1kCp-UiL5nVsjvYB47j1zCps8tyRTF4LcUO_33FLrjGHbPTP24D8UqfAmXTp-h-Saj9mmJJV4QXuq-ATO-YhtnFow' alt='Former Peruvian president Martín Vizcarra attends a court session in Lima where judges announce his corruption sentence.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Role as governor: The charges stem from Vizcarra’s tenure as governor of Moquegua, during which he oversaw infrastructure projects that prosecutors said were steered toward companies that paid him kickbacks for construction contracts.</li><li>Construction companies: Peruvian authorities accused him of taking illicit payments from multiple construction firms, part of a broader pattern of corruption involving public works and private contractors in the country’s regions.</li><li>Pattern of leaders: His conviction follows earlier corruption cases against other ex-presidents, reinforcing a striking pattern in which several of Peru’s recent leaders have ended up jailed or investigated over graft allegations.</li><li>Judicial message: By sentencing a former head of state over actions predating his presidency, the court signaled that public officials can face legal consequences for abuses committed even earlier in their political careers.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Peruvian judiciary: The court framed its decision as part of enforcing accountability for corruption in public works contracts, stressing that no official is beyond the reach of the law when evidence of bribery is proven.
