Apple today updated its Apple Cash feature to introduce a set of stickers that can be used in the Messages app. The stickers are Apple Cash themed, featuring emoji that you might want to use when sending or receiving a payment.<br/>

Each sticker is animated, and has an iridescent texture that gives a glinting effect as the sticker moves. <br/>
<br/>
The Apple Cash stickers are rolling out to users starting today. You can find them by opening up the Messages app and selecting a conversation, then tapping on the "+" button next to the text bar. From there, tap on the "Stickers" option and swipe over to Apple Cash.<br/>

Apple Cash stickers will show up in the Messages Sticker list automatically, and there is no option to download them from the Sticker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. The stickers also aren't able to be removed, because Apple Cash is not an app that can be uninstalled. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-cash/">Apple Cash</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/10/apple-cash-stickers-messages/">Check Out These Fun New Apple Cash Stickers in the Messages App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/check-out-these-fun-new-apple-cash-stickers-in-the-messages-app.2474480/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
