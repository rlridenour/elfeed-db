Ring is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-video-descriptions-gen-ai">updating its iOS app</a> with support for AI-powered video descriptions, with a quick text-based summary of what's going on in video footage.<br/>

The AI summaries show up in motion notifications, so when you get a motion alert on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, you'll be able to see a text summary of what the camera has detected. The text alerts show context about what's happening so you can decide whether or not you need to tap into the video feed to see more.<br/>
<br/>
Ring says that the text alerts are meant to give customers with the ability to distinguish urgent activity from everyday activity at a glance. Video descriptions describe the main subject in the video that caused the motion alert, and the action that's happening.<br/>
