<p>Israel said it recovered the remains of Ran Gvili, described as the last Israeli hostage held in Gaza, bringing the long effort to retrieve hostages from the Oct. 7, 2023, attack to an end. With no Israeli hostages left in Gaza, the U.N. and other actors are urging movement to the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and broader U.S.-backed plan for Gaza, though major hurdles remain. Israeli leaders say the next phase includes disarming Hamas and demilitarizing Gaza, while Hamas says the ceasefire terms must be implemented fully without delay. Separately, Israel said it would reopen the Rafah border crossing in coming days with limitations, a step often described as critical for Gaza’s connection to the outside world.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gQNhVqDUCmDGpf2xTw8enEN0ivxGqziaOjoF8-PUoJ20zQK-12EVAUmvr4kJZYqbLuMrIOm81JgC2pWyacLexbYbKaTkkTjxksbjaJ_wtR-jQ9l5MRbE3v935JRsomUW' alt='Vehicle carrying Ran Gvili’s remains arrives at Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv, January 26, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Rafah crossing: Israel said Rafah would reopen in the “next days” for foot traffic only, and PBS described the crossing as Gaza’s main lifeline to the world.</li><li>Families’ pressure: The Associated Press was cited as reporting that Gvili’s family urged Israel to delay the plan’s second phase until his remains were recovered and returned.</li><li>U.N. push: CBS reported the U.N. is pressing for “next steps” once hostages are recovered, while noting phase-two negotiations come with fresh complications.</li><li>Symbolic closure: The Straits Times reported Israelis planned to switch off a clock that had been counting the time since the Oct. 7 attack after the last hostage’s body was found.</li><li>Recovery details: Le Monde reported the body was recovered from a cemetery in northern Gaza and identified by the Israeli army, framing it as a marker of a “new phase”.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli government (Netanyahu): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the next phase is disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, calling the recovery an “incredible achievement.”.
