<p>Hundreds of thousands of people filled Budapest streets on October 23 as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his main challenger Péter Magyar staged competing rallies ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for April 2026; the shows of force took place on the anniversary of the 1956 uprising and drew sharply different portrayals in domestic and international media . Supporters at the Orbán-aligned demonstrations pressed a peace-oriented message — captured in chants like &quot;We don&#x27;t want to die for Ukraine&quot; — while opposition backers used the commemoration to argue for political change, making the day an early test of mobilization ahead of next spring&#x27;s vote .
