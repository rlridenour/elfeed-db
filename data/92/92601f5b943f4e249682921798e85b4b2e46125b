<p>China has executed 11 people it said were core members of a Myanmar-based crime network linked to telecoms fraud and other serious crimes, according to Chinese state media reports cited by multiple outlets. The action is part of Beijing’s broader push to dismantle scam operations in Southeast Asia that have targeted Chinese citizens and, increasingly, victims worldwide. Authorities and state media described the group as connected to scam centres in Myanmar and reported that additional defendants received lengthy prison sentences, underscoring a sweeping law-enforcement response rather than a single isolated case. While the case highlights the scale and brutality that some scam operations can involve, the wider stated aim is to curb cross-border fraud that has drained savings and endangered victims.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/K3KifcvO5JO52atxMz_2vb_CQKkLoFTix0ECj16rZfigboxOjU3FMiZQrPfDL9Qu-ojqnCepfvAss4sVYWghmdPa4OgTRplSf6QafE69_07-X6AUx6bpLJkZYXLDFt4bPbSr3NyzrGFo_7SdDokKp3TYuZKNdnlIh7GN-1djGQ' alt='Image used with ABC News report on China’s crackdown on Myanmar-based scam operations.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Court details: China’s Wenzhou Intermediate People’s Court in Zhejiang carried out the executions, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported.</li><li>Crimes cited: Reports said those executed were convicted in a case involving allegations including fraud, drug trafficking and murder.</li><li>Victim toll: Chinese authorities said the group’s crimes included the killing of 14 Chinese citizens, according to an AP dispatch carried by ABC News.</li><li>Scale of fraud: The scam and gambling operations were described as worth more than US$1 billion, highlighting the financial stakes behind the crackdown.</li><li>Sentencing sweep: Separate from the executions, 23 other suspects were reported to have received prison terms ranging from five years to life.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Chinese authorities/state media: State media framed the executions as part of an intensified crackdown on Myanmar-based scam compounds and associated serious crimes.
