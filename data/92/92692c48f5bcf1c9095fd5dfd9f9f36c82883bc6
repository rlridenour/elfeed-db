<p>Ben Thompson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem with these tariffs is that their scale and
indiscriminate nature will have the effect of destroying demand
<em>and</em> destroying the capability to develop alternative supply. I
suppose if the only goal is to hurt China then shooting yourself
in the foot, such that you no longer need to buy shoes for stumps,
is a strategy you could choose, but that does nothing to help with
what should be the primary motivation: shoring up the U.S.
national security base.</p>

<p>Those national security concerns are real. The final stage of
disruption is when the entity that started on the bottom is
uniquely equipped to deliver what is necessary for a new
paradigm, and that is exactly what happened with electronics
generally and drones specifically. Moreover, this capability is
only going to grow more important with the rise of AI, which
will be substantiated in the physical world through robotics.
And, of course, robots will be the key to building other robots;
if the U.S. wants to be competitive in the future, and not be
dependent on China, it really does need to make changes — just
not these ones.</p>
