<p>These prices — which I presume are a back-to-school season promotion — are even lower than those during the weeklong “Prime Day” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/07/make_me_rich_on_amazon_prime_day">earlier this month</a>, and you don’t need to be a Prime subscriber to get them:</p>

<ul>
<li>The pretty-good base configuration (16 GB RAM, 256 GB storage) <a href="https://amzn.to/4fdd0gN">is just $800</a>.</li>
<li>The configuration with <a href="https://amzn.to/40HrhfR">16 GB RAM and 512 GB is $1,000</a>, the normal price for the base model.</li>
<li>You can splurge and get <a href="https://amzn.to/3U4PgSC">24 GB RAM with 512 GB storage for just $1,200</a>.</li>
</ul>
