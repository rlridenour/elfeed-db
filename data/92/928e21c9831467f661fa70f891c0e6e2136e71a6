<p>India&#x27;s government has declared the car explosion near New Delhi&#x27;s historic Red Fort a &quot;terrorist incident,&quot; condemning the &quot;dastardly and cowardly act&quot; and directing security agencies to urgently investigate. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the explosion &quot;clearly a terrorist attack,&quot; praised India&#x27;s &quot;measured, cautious, and professional&quot; probe and said he had offered assistance after speaking with India&#x27;s foreign minister. Reports of fatalities and injuries varied across outlets, with initial counts ranging from eight to 13 deaths and scores wounded. Authorities and media also warned that unrelated, older images have circulated online misrepresenting the blast scene, complicating public understanding.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/e2UOmfKL8ZPH8fHuVF3KXGKjNfDKpHm0QVBR9Qq-LxkxZtTsH9t80DV6q0RxElfKzAH_wJoflNgLGg5BweLPqRJP2V19xY-tU7LEqCcDQXF0er34N3QQ3VLBxpPtPmwXYiiRfeMCRCDIk20G26J3Lyki8Jovyi8TGgKBRJ0QiQpBPjsfVcwAMIulcBcnonFU' alt='Scene related to reporting on the Red Fort blast' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Legal powers: The cabinet&#x27;s &quot;terror&quot; designation allows investigators expanded powers including prolonged detentions and broader arrest authority for suspects.</li><li>Casualty reports: Published death tolls vary by outlet: BBC reported eight dead, NDTV at least nine, France24 at least 12 and RT reported 13 fatalities, reflecting rapidly changing official counts.</li><li>Forensic work: Security agencies said tests are being run on samples recovered from the vehicle to determine explosive composition and origin.</li><li>International engagement: Rubio said he spoke with India&#x27;s S.
