<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to announce a public β for Marked 3. I&rsquo;m 🙏 this will be a short 🏃 and it will make it to public 🚀 before my unemployment benefits 👻. So if you&rsquo;re interested in helping me squash some 🪲, please come 🥳!</p>

<p>Once I have some assurance that it&rsquo;s not all horribly broken, I&rsquo;m going to be pushing pretty hard to get the final release out. I could <em>really</em> use the income right now, and I think the last 9 months of work will be worth it to a lot of users&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been running this beta as a limited release for a month now and I think I have all the biggest bugs squashed. I need more eyes on it, though, because of the sheer quantity of new features, many of which apply to a limited subset of users.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2025/09/06/a-quick-look-at-marked-3/">my previous post on the new version</a> for in-depth details about the new features that you might want to test out. Here are the highlights, with a couple of additions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Custom Rules editor for conditional custom processors and built-in transformations</li>
  <li>Completely revamped DOCX handling, both import and export</li>
  <li>Revamped Scrivener rendering</li>
  <li>Revamped CriticMarkup handling</li>
  <li>Markdown Dingus</li>
  <li>Style Stealer</li>
  <li>Comments/Footnotes Sidebar</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[Wiki Link]]</code> navigation with back/forward navigation and backlinks in the same directory</li>
  <li>Style Manager, plus new Gallery and Editor</li>
  <li>Improved, keyboard-driven export panel</li>
  <li>Improved Word Repetition view with floating panel showing top-used
  words and allowing exclusion</li>
</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://markedapp.com/help/changelog.html">a bunch more</a>. The only feature from the &ldquo;quick look&rdquo; post that didn&rsquo;t make it into this release is the ability to put footnotes on the same page as they occur in PDF/Print export. That feature needs more work to be usable, but it&rsquo;s definitely on my list to do after I get the initial v3 out. Subscribers will automatically get this functionality when it&rsquo;s added.</p>

<p>In particular, I need testing on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DOCX import and export</li>
  <li>Paginated PDF generation</li>
  <li>Custom Rules</li>
</ul>

<p>These features have taken a lot of work but need more testing with a broader range of source documents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The current roadmap can be seen <a href="https://rnkd.xyz/poll/cmi37xsdq006fu3mtjqohbxa4">in this poll</a>, where you&rsquo;re welcome to order the features based on your own priorities and influence where my time goes from here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Development has been feverish since April and there&rsquo;s enough new stuff that not all of it has been as thoroughly tested as I would like. So get the beta, use it in all the ways you want to, and let me know what you run into.</p>

<p>If you join the beta, when you submit a bug report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <strong>Help-&gt;Report an Issue</strong> to create a bundle with your config settings</li>
  <li>Adjust the subject line to a relevant title for your feedback</li>
  <li>Include screenshots and source files (Markdown, Word, etc.)</li>
  <li>Email me directly at the supplied address, or try the new support forum at <a href="https://support.markedapp.com">support.markedapp.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you experiencing a crash</strong>, you can use the &ldquo;Submit Report&rdquo; button that macOS pops up, but please include your email and as much detail as possible in the notes field (particularly what you were doing when the crash occurred). Anonymous reports without context don&rsquo;t do me nearly as much good as an explanation with a means of contacting you for followup.</p>

<blockquote class="warn">
  <p>You can subscribe to any plan in the beta and you won&rsquo;t be charged, it will just help test the purchase process.
One thing I&rsquo;m having issues with is Marked&rsquo;s trial mode not working. If, after first install, you&rsquo;re unable to open documents even though it shows you have a trial active, please do respond via <strong>Help-&gt;Report an Issue</strong>, or post on <a href="https://support.markedapp.com">the support site</a> to help me solve this issue.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>There&rsquo;s an intermediate step of joining a private mailing list before you get the TestFlight link. I&rsquo;m just using this list as a way to make sure I can maintain contact with testers outside of just release notes. 
If I offer any kind of reward (discount) to beta testers at the end of the beta, this is how I&rsquo;ll contact you. The beta is run through TestFlight, but the final release will be available the Mac App Store, direct purchase (Paddle), and Setapp.</p>

<p>I look forward to your feedback!</p>
