<p>My friend John Siracusa launched his Mac utility <a href="https://hypercritical.co/hyperspace/">Hyperspace</a> back in February. The app uses a clever feature of APFS, the Apple file system, to purge a disk of duplicate data without disrupting any files.  You get free space back on disk without losing anything. It’s a very clever idea, and you can download Hyperspace for free to see what it might save you before paying a cent.</p>
<p>On Thursday John released a new version that’s <a href="https://hypercritical.co/2025/05/01/hyperspace-update">a major milestone</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In some ways, Hyperspace version 1.3 is what I originally envisioned when I started the project. But <a href="https://hypercritical.co/frame-game/#10-full">software development is never a straight line</a>. It’s a forest. And like a forest it’s easy to lose your way. Launching with a more limited version 1.0 led to some angry reviews and low ratings in the Mac App Store, but it made the app safer from day one, and ultimately better for every user, now and in the future.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The new version will reclaim space from packages, cloud storage, and Library directories, all of which were specifically barred from the very careful 1.0 release. If you tried Hyperspace and were disappointed with the savings, it might be worth another look. This new version enabled more than 12 GB of savings on my local disk.</p>
