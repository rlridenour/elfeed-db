<p>I think it’s become tradition for Mark Gurman to run a mega spoiler report on the WWDC keynote the Friday before. Don’t read it if you don’t want to see a <em>lot</em> of genuine spoilers. But here are a few non-spoilers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The AI changes will be surprisingly minor and are unlikely to
impress industry watchers, especially considering the rapid pace
of innovation by Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta Platforms Inc.,
Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know a single person who will be surprised if Apple’s in-house AI changes are minor. Literally, not one. The only way for Apple to surprise on the AI front would be for the improvements to be major. Who’s the guy who will be surprised by underwhelming advances on the AI front from Apple next week? <a href="https://crazyapplerumors.com/2006/08/21/everybody-tired-of-one-mac-user/">Artie MacStrawman</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While there has been speculation that the app icons will be round
to match the style on the Apple Watch and Vision Pro, the shape is
staying largely the same on the iPhone and iPad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always beware the passive voice. “There has been speculation”? It was Gurman’s own report, back in March, that left some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/ios-19-visionos-apple-massive-ui-overhaul/">with the decided impression</a> that Apple was making icons circular across all platforms under the nonsensical argument that users find it jarring to see differently-shaped icons on different devices. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/apple-readies-dramatic-design-overhauls-for-ios-19-ipados-19-and-macos-16?embedded-checkout=true">Gurman, back in March</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A key goal of the overhaul is to make Apple’s different operating
systems look similar and more consistent. Right now, the
applications, icons and window styles vary across macOS, iOS and
visionOS. That can make it jarring to hop from one device to
another. [...]</p>

<p>VisionOS differs from iOS and macOS in the use of circular app
icons, a simplified approach to windows, translucent panels for
navigation, and a more prominent use of 3D depth and shadows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My guess is that if Apple does go with circular icons across all platforms next week (which I sure hope they don’t because that seems dumb), Gurman will take credit for calling it back in March, despite writing today that “the shape is staying largely the same”. Heads, Gurman wins. Tails, Gurman doesn’t lose.</p>

<p>Back to today’s mega-spoiler report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Camera app will be revamped with a focus on simplicity. Apple
has added several new photo and video-taking options in recent
years — including spatial video, panorama and slow-motion
recording — and that’s made today’s interface a bit clunky. In
iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, Apple is rethinking the approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can’t recall seeing Gurman ever, not even once, crediting anyone else for scooping anything first. Jon Prosser made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaP_q9W3AQE">an entire video about the supposed new Camera app design</a> all the way back on January 17, replete with animated mockups of how it will look and work. (Looks pretty clever to me, starting with a back-to-basics simple focus on two main modes — Photo or Video — and putting all other sub-modes under those.)</p>
