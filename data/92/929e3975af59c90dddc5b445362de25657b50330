The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-macbook-pro-with-m5-chip/">new 14-inch MacBook Pro</a> with an M5 chip does not include a charger in the box in European countries, including the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway, and others, according to Apple's online store.<br/>

In the U.S. and all other countries outside of Europe, the new MacBook Pro comes with Apple's 70W USB-C Power Adapter, but European customers miss out.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has gradually stopped including chargers with many products over the years — a decision it has attributed to its environmental goals.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, an Apple spokesperson <a href="https://x.com/LelloucheNico/status/1978510945224688060">told French website <em>Numerama</em>'s Nicolas Lellouche</a> that the decision to not include a charger with this particular MacBook Pro was made in anticipation of a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202402997">European regulation</a> that will require Apple to provide customers with the option to purchase certain devices without a charger in the box, starting in April.<br/>
<br/>
According to the European Union law database, Apple could have let customers in Europe decide whether they wanted to have a charger included in the box or not, but the company has ultimately decided to not include one whatsoever:<blockquote><strong>Can a radio equipment be sold with the charging device in-box?</strong><br/>
<br/>
Yes, as long as the consumer has also the choice of buying the same radio equipment without a charging device in-box.</blockquote>Apple still includes a USB-C to MagSafe 3 cable in the box with the 14-inch MacBook Pro in Europe, so you only need to supply a charger if you need one.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.K., the 70W USB-C Power Adapter <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MXN53B/A/70W%20USB-C%20Power%20Adapter">costs £59</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that the 14-inch MacBook Pro is €100 cheaper in some European countries, although the Euro is stronger against the U.S. compared to a year ago. In the U.K., the new model has the same starting price as the previous model.<br/>
