<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Re-surfacing a draft blog post, sparked by a departed online friend.  (Hint: the last sentence is &ldquo;More as I know it.&rdquo;)

<p><small>I’ve sat on this post since <time datetime="2023-07-20" title="2023-07-20">July 2023</time>.  Since that time Craig has died, though
not without writing and sharing his vulnerability and love of life.  He didn’t
go quietly into the night.  But continued to share; a mix of the physiological
impact of cancer but also his continued desire to learn, play, and be human.</small></p>

<p>For quite some time I’ve been reading <a href="https://decafbad.net/">Craig Maloney’s</a> blog.  For the last while,
his posts have included aspects of living with cancer and cancer treatments.
But that is only one of the threads that weave throughout his day to day
blogging.</p>
<p><time datetime="2023-07-20" title="2023-07-20">Today</time> I read the following:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite" cite="https://decafbad.net/2023/07/19/checking-in-2023-07-19/">

I was thinking about some of my programming projects and realizing that I tend
to think within my own perceived capabilities.  That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad
thing but it makes me wonder just how far I could go if I pushed myself beyond
these boundaries.  How much more could my grasp be if I reached beyond what I
think it might be.  That&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m going to have to practice with.
I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how this would look or be but that&rsquo;s the beauty of
practicing something like this; if I fail I know one of my boundaries and what
to work on.

<p>One strategy to discover my “perceived capabilities” is to spend a bit of time
reflecting on the things that I know historically shifted those capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://takeonrules.com/about/resume/">My resume</a> alludes to many of my professional “perceived capabilities.”  My blog
testifies to other aspects of those “perceived capabilities.”  And <a href="http://github.com/jeremyf">my Github
profile</a> provides other insight.</p>
<p>Yet these are all <em>by-products</em> of my capabilities.</p>
<p>I’ve been working in <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails">Ruby on Rails</a></span> (<abbr title="Ruby on Rails">Rails</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Ruby on Rails”" title="Other site-wide references of “Ruby on Rails”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ROR">&#128214;</a></small>)
 since <time datetime="2005-12" title="2005-12">December 2005</time>.  That framework has helped
shaped my perceived capabilities <em>in regards to my programming</em>.  But more
important has been my ongoing curiosity around things not related to digital
computering.</p>
<p>I consider 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2011/08/09/mustering-into-the-gencon-volunteer-corp/">Mustering into the GenCon Volunteer Corp</a></cite> as a critical moment for
myself.  At the time, while waiting in line, my wife nudged me to see if I could
help get things moving.  This highlighted that direct action matters.</p>
<p>I also look to my <time datetime="2018" title="2018">2018</time> 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2019/05/19/reading-challenges/">Reading Challenges</a></cite>; taking a year to set aside reading
books written by men.  This arbitrary decision helped broaden my perspectives
and pay more attention to the books I read, which in turn stewards my journey.</p>
<p>In <time datetime="2020" title="2020">2020</time>, I adopted <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
 as my text editor.  A decision that continues to have
profound and unexpected impacts.  Forging new face to face friendships; which
has a direct tie to conversations around <span>Emacs</span>
.</p>
<p>Expanding my blogs topic from “all about games” to “all that I care to publish”
also demonstrated an expanded capacity; finding what I consider a more lyrical
voice and other folks who have a plurality of interests and values.  I’m no
longer looking for those who blog about games, but for those who write about
their passions.</p>

<p>I’ve also shifted my problem solving strategies.  In particular I’ve started
asking more questions; trying to bring clarification before diving into
implementing a “solution looking for a problem.”</p>
<p>This means more writing, and in the case of work, making that available for
review and feedback.  I’m seeing this direction of pressing against a perceived
capability yielding positive results; namely helping provide checks for ensuring
that a group’s excitement matches their capacity.</p>
<p>These clarifications are not intended to halt but instead ensure we collectively
understand a problem and can then work towards a solution.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are other <em>perceived capabilities</em> that are not, at this point
salient.  But in the words of a departed sage…</p>
<p>“More as I know it.”</p>
