<h2>5.1.0 on 2025-11-07</h2>

<p>This version fixes a critical bug in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-with-colors</code>
macro. In short, it was not working as before or was not working at
all. Now it should do the right thing.</p>

<p>Thanks to Alexandr Semenov for reporting a relevant bug in issue 170
and for helping me test the results: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/170">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/170</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Stéphane Marks for testing some configurations with the
latest stable Emacs version as well as with builds from emacs.git.
This was done via a private channel and I am sharing this information
with permission.</p>

<p>Also thanks to Stefan Monnier for monitoring my commits as I was
trying to refactor the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-with-colors</code> macro. Some comments
were posted on the emacs-devel mailing list, as well as a patch that I
ended up applying and then reverting (check the commit log for the
technicalities): <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2025-11/msg00114.html">https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2025-11/msg00114.html</a>.</p>

<p>Apologies to everyone for the inconvenience! This was a tricky bug.
The good thing is that it compelled me to improve several parts of the
code.</p>

<p>This version also includes a clarification in the manual about
building a theme on top of Modus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Web page:</strong> Visit <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes#h:86eb375b-9be4-43ce-879a-0686a524a63b">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes#h:86eb375b-9be4-43ce-879a-0686a524a63b</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Info manual:</strong> Evaluate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(info "(modus-themes) Build on top of the Modus themes")</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, it mentions that a theme exists in an appropriately named
file that is part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">custom-theme-load-path</code>. Thanks to Ashton
Wiersdorf for asking a related question in issue 171:
