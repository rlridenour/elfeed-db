<p>This worrying result was first published by German mathematician Oskar Schlömilch in 1868. (The discrepancy is explained by minute gaps in the diagonals, as explained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessboard_paradox">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) seems to have been taken with the paradox &#8212; his papers show that between 1890 and 1893 he was working to determine all the squares that might similarly be converted into rectangles with a &#8220;gain&#8221; of one unit of area, apparently unaware that V. Schlegel had carried out the same task much earlier.</p>
