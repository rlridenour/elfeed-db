Just hours after we published a long list of Apple Stores that are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/apple-stores-opening-or-closing-list/">opening or closing this year</a>, Apple has announced one more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/Apple-Store-Shadyside-Pittsburgh.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012165" /><em>The existing Apple Shadyside opened in 2004</em></div><br/>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/shadyside/">Apple Shadyside</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania will be on the move next month, with the store set to relocate from 5508 Walnut Street to 5436 Walnut Street. The new store is in a two-floor unit that was previously occupied by clothing brand Gap. Apple has completed extensive renovations to the unit, which has an all-new facade.<br/>
<br/>
The new store will be holding its grand opening on Saturday, August 9 at 10 a.m. local time, according <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/shadyside/">to Apple's website</a>. It is located just west of Bellefonte Street, just steps away from Apple's existing store on Walnut Street.<br/>
<br/>
The new store is significantly larger than the original Apple Shadyside, which will be closing as part of the shuffle. It will have an updated design, which typically includes an Apple Pickup station for in-store pickup of online orders, and often a Genius Bar with varied table and seat heights for improved accessibility. Apple's newer stores also use more engineered wood, whereas classic stores made extensive use of stainless steel.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Shadyside first opened in September 2004, so the company has already been doing business on Walnut Street for more than 20 years.<br/>
