<p>Formed in 1965, the Doors burned hot until Jim Morrison died in 1971, and the band finally broke up in 1973. The group left behind more than a few fine songs—“Light My Fire,” “Break On Through (To the Other Side),” “L.A. Woman,” and “Roadhouse Blues,” to name a few. Above, the music collective <em>Playing for Change</em> pays tribute to another Doors classic,&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.openculture.com/2018/07/doors-ray-manzarek-walks-writing-bands-iconic-song-riders-storm.html">Riders on the Storm</a>.” Featuring performances by the two surviving Doors members John Densmore and Robby Krieger, the video also weaves in appearances by 20+ musicians, everyone from Lukas and Micah Nelson, to Don Was and Foo Fighters keyboardist Rami Jaffee. According to <em>Playing for Change</em>, the “performance reimagines the classic anthem as a meditation on unity, hope, and shared humanity,” qualities that otherwise seem in short supply today. Enjoy!</p>
