Apple at WWDC previewed a bunch of new features coming in its updated operating systems, but certain changes will have been met with dismay by third-party developers who already offer apps with equivalent or similar features. In other words, their product has been "sherlocked" by Apple. <br/>

When Apple creates an app or a feature that has functionality found in a third-party app, it is referred to as sherlocking. The name dates back to a "Sherlock" search tool in OS X that Apple enhanced with features that were cribbed from a third-party app called Watson. Watson's developers accused Apple of copying the product without compensation, and from then on, sherlocking has been used to describe apps that are supplanted by Apple. <br/>
<br/>
Here are the features in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, and watchOS 26 that, to various extents, sherlock popular existing apps. <br/>

<br/>

Sherlocks various <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/notes-for-apple-watch/id1453148171">note-taking apps</a> for Apple Watch.</li><br/>
<br/>
<li><strong>Allow in the Menu Bar</strong> – In macOS Tahoe's System Settings, you can now control which third-party apps are allowed to display menu bar items. Sherlocks <a href="https://www.macbartender.com">Bartender</a> and <a href="https://icemenubar.app">Ice</a>.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Spotlight Clipboard Search</strong> – In macOS Tahoe, Spotlight users can search and view previously copied content in their clipboard history – including both text and images – making it easy to retrieve items copied earlier. Sherlocks <a href="https://pasteapp.io">Paste</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/pastebot/id1179623856?mt=12">Pastebot</a>.</li></ul>Of course, some of these apps may still offer additional functionality beyond what Apple has implemented, and developers of sherlocked apps sometimes find ways to improve their apps to differentiate them from Apple, so there's hopefully life left in many of them yet.<br/>
