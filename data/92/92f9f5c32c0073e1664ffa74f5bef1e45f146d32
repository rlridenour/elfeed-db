<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in London for talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz as European leaders coordinate their response to a US-drafted peace proposal to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. The meeting follows several days of negotiations between Ukrainian and US officials in Miami that ended on Saturday without a breakthrough, although Zelenskyy described those talks as &quot;constructive, although not easy&quot;. President Trump has publicly criticized Zelenskyy, alleging he had not read the latest US proposal, while Kyiv insists it is carefully examining the terms and will not accept a settlement imposed from outside. European governments are using the London gathering to show continued political backing for Ukraine and to argue that any peace deal must respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and involve meaningful European participation in the process.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/jbUPh8TD5nsrcTNHMvGnTBBjBpBPd-SJfUYUZodVgmOu-07SDBXyIwN19AQib88lwS9-uu_INhZxhpm1graaY8dpg7C5CuZBB6ZdNBLGX9Q71gDhQVihKXo-cYluP3GzG0IEfSLjmhgEEdKc6uK0WTzzUHg__FSpOW5kE1tjqyFv-h5WGRV8Uiz02Gc47XmCMTK4mY_e5lY4kdnPmputX3YJCbg' alt='Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv ahead of diplomacy-focused talks with European leaders in London.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Miami negotiations: US–Ukraine discussions in Miami lasted several days and concluded on Saturday without agreement on the US-authored plan, though both sides committed to keep negotiating.</li><li>European format: The London talks bring together the leaders of the UK, France and Germany in a format designed to strengthen Kyiv’s leverage in wider negotiations and prevent it from facing pressure alone.</li><li>EU political stance: European Council President António Costa signaled resistance to perceived US interference in European politics after Washington issued a security strategy critical of Europe’s approach, underscoring tensions around how peace talks should be shaped.</li><li>Europe’s peace role: European capitals see the London meeting as a way to ensure they have a central voice in any eventual settlement, rather than leaving the process dominated by Washington and Moscow.</li><li>Ukrainian position: Kyiv has indicated it is willing to assess proposals but has stressed that any agreement must be acceptable to Ukrainian society and leadership, rejecting the idea of a deal forced upon the country by external powers.</li></ul><blockquote>Constructive, although not easy - Volodymyr Zelenskyy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukrainian government: Zelenskyy portrays the recent Miami discussions on the US proposal as balanced but difficult and signals that Ukraine will keep engaging while carefully defending its interests.
