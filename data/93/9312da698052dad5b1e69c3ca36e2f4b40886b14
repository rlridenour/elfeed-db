<p>Veteran marketing exec Andrew Woodward <a href="https://andrewwoodward.net/2025/07/16/born-again-apple-mac-geek-thanks-to-amateur-ham-radio/">wrote a charming blog post</a> about his re-engagement with the geekier side of the Mac platform as a part of his new hobby of amateur radio:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The most surprising and one of the best things about my rediscovery of radio is how it’s converged with computers and the Mac (and to a lesser extent iPad and iPhone). Computers are an integral part of modern amateur radio when it comes to controlling radios, seeing activity, transmitting and receiving voice and data messages, logging, and communicating via amateur radio repeaters on satellites, including the International Space Station. And that’s not even half of it.  </p>
<p>  The Mac is well supported in amateur radio and there’s a great, active, innovative and clever developer community and fan base. I’ve been introduced to great developers like <a href="https://roskosch.de/">Marcus Roskosch</a> and <a href="https://ham-radio-apps.com/">SDR Control </a>, <a href="https://dogparksoftware.com/">Dogpark Software</a>, <a href="https://www.dl2rum.de/rumsoft/RUMLog.html">RUMsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.rtsystemsinc.com/RT-Programmers-for-the-Mac_ep_427-1.html">RT Systems</a> and <a href="https://chirpmyradio.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home">Chirp</a>. There are many, many more (see <a href="https://machamradio.com/">Mac Ham Radio</a>). A popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt3qIBs3Vdg">YouTuber Mike K8MRD</a> is a massive <a href="https://youtu.be/981kQlVFvxA">Mac fan boy</a>. The convergence of radio and computing has made me a born again Mac Geek. My iPad and iPhone are mainly used for <a href="https://ham-radio-apps.com/ham-toolbox/">logging</a> and checking <a href="https://solar.w5mmw.net/">space weather for broadcasting conditions</a>. There are also some familiar names popular in the Mac ham radio circles like Rogue Amoeba and its <a href="https://help.remotehamradio.com/help/setting-up-wsjt-x-on-macosx-with-xcat-xdax-and-loopback">Loopback</a> software.

<p>This is a fun look at one Mac user’s varying relationship with the platform and how it connected in some unexpected ways when he dove into a new hobby. I really enjoyed reading it.</p>
