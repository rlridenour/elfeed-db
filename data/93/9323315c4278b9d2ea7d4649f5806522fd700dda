<p>Today I did some buffering tests in 10 languages where I wrote the equivalent of this
program and then ran the program with <code>./program | grep hello</code></p>
<pre><code>while True:
    print(&quot;hello&quot;)
    sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>In 4 of the languages (Python, Ruby, C, Perl) nothing at at all gets printed (because they buffer the output when stdout isn&rsquo;t a TTY, the buffer size is probably 4k or something)</li>
<li>in the others (Go, C++, JS, Rust, Java, Lua, bash) you see &ldquo;hello&rdquo; printed out once per second. PHP is in this category too.</li>
</ul>
<p>I knew there was some variation here I didn&rsquo;t have a list of which languages did which and now I do. (If you want to not buffer the output you can flush stdout)</p>
