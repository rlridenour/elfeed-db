<p>Japan says Chinese naval fighter jets repeatedly aimed fire-control radar at Japanese Air Self-Defense Force F-15Js over international waters northeast of Taiwan near the Miyako Strait on Saturday, an action Japan views as a precursor to weapons use and a serious safety risk. Tokyo lodged a formal diplomatic protest with Beijing and demanded measures to prevent a repeat, describing the radar targeting as &quot;extremely regrettable&quot; and beyond what is needed for safe flight operations. China rejected the accusation, saying instead that Japanese aircraft repeatedly approached and disrupted what it called normal training activities by forces from its Liaoning aircraft carrier group. The incident comes amid already tense relations following recent remarks by Japan’s prime minister about Taiwan’s security, and it has prompted calls from both Tokyo and Canberra to avoid escalation and maintain dialogue in the region.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/IjHWnigCtdBTWfKNH_xQL-olGp02CvIsjZTA7Kq0MvTyDKyEwHJQkIKKCadsXtMPw8aPfKLHfZ_XeVY-7--rJUsEgmdYJmGBUfW1_c-Er2bm02CoUa2R8A_-Z5Y4D0UAauKWyslSqRnqTP0jiM5mgJ_SSa64s8i7enx05dIPhm8iHCo0XZ9qfF_sTrfTh-8jXb8SSSP1' alt='China’s first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, sailing near Okinawa in an earlier deployment.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Two separate incidents: Japan’s Defence Ministry reported that J-15 fighters from the carrier Liaoning illuminated F-15Js with fire-control radar in two distinct episodes within a few hours, with the first lasting several minutes and a later one occurring as Japanese jets shadowed the Chinese carrier group.</li><li>Location significance: The encounters took place over international waters northeast of Taiwan near the Miyako Strait, a key passage used by China’s navy to move between the East China Sea and the Pacific and close to Japan’s southwestern islands including Yonaguni.</li><li>Japanese safety concerns: Tokyo argued that using fire-control radar against foreign aircraft can be misread as preparation to launch missiles, warning that such actions increase the risk of miscalculation and accidents between the two militaries operating in close proximity.</li><li>Chinese counterclaim: China’s Defence Ministry said its aircraft acted lawfully and that Japanese Self-Defense Force planes conducted close-in reconnaissance and interference against its training mission, for which Beijing says it has lodged its own representations with Tokyo.</li><li>Calls for de-escalation: Australia joined Japan in urging all parties to exercise restraint and adhere to international rules for air and maritime encounters, emphasizing that open communication mechanisms help prevent incidents from spiralling into broader crises in the Indo-Pacific.</li></ul><blockquote>We will continue to strongly demand that China take responsible actions based on international law and rules to prevent such dangerous acts from happening again - Shinjiro Koizumi</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Japan: Tokyo says the Chinese radar illumination was a dangerous act that exceeded what is necessary for safe aircraft operations and has filed a strong protest demanding steps to avoid future incidents.
