<p>British politician and former UK ambassador to the United States Peter Mandelson will retire from the House of Lords this week after newly released US “Epstein files” revealed previously undisclosed contacts and information-sharing with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Prime Minister Keir Starmer had announced plans to fast‑track legislation that would strip Mandelson of his right to sit in the unelected chamber and remove his title if he did not go voluntarily. The British government has referred material from the files to the Metropolitan Police, which is reviewing allegations that Mandelson passed on live policy deliberations and market‑sensitive details about the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent rescue efforts while serving in government. While no charges have been brought, police and parliamentary authorities say they are assessing whether any misconduct in public office or breaches of official information rules took place, as pressure mounts in the UK to show that powerful figures are not above scrutiny.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/oMHBCMUqkq2VwWyhswgSMyVqj7ERD40mB4qM11g5iqgNlRBZ56bBnzeOfFLw6NHEa1f6_90VOSGBBwjKisgozWKjND7PjzMN8AMCvp8gqtRiqdyqXgZ9YKjIcdoksk_aYIjGCZlPUpbaGXtzKjZnTR1rwL8YVXj4lueik3j27Kj5tWxPyTuRed4LYIPW2CGIVMQA6TARX3bAWXJy0Q9a5cmSQ8HCG_mrhOuYXwiMcwKjyWsehSb3LiAOYiPufE5xkHtavcS8PIzb1c8Hsw' alt='Peter Mandelson speaks at a public event in London in 2025, before the latest Epstein‑file revelations.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Title removal: Downing Street signalled it is prepared to legislate not only to end Mandelson’s membership of the House of Lords but also to remove the noble title &quot;Lord Mandelson,&quot; an unusually severe step in modern British politics.</li><li>Epstein access: Newly released documents suggest Mandelson allowed Epstein insight into internal UK government decision‑making while Mandelson was a cabinet minister, raising concerns about whether a private financier gained privileged access to sensitive discussions.</li><li>Market information: A spokesperson for Keir Starmer’s office said the Epstein documents appear to show Mandelson sharing details that would likely have influenced financial markets during the 2008 crash and the state’s efforts to stabilise the banking system.</li><li>Police review: The UK Cabinet Office has passed material from the US Department of Justice files to the Metropolitan Police, which confirmed it is reviewing allegations of misconduct in a public office linked to the newly surfaced evidence.</li><li>Past resignations: Mandelson previously stepped down twice from Tony Blair’s cabinet before being elevated to the Lords in 2008 so that then‑Prime Minister Gordon Brown could appoint him business secretary.</li></ul><blockquote>He has let his country down. - Keir Starmer</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Keir Starmer and UK government: Prime Minister Keir Starmer ordered an urgent review of Mandelson’s dealings with Epstein and said new legislation would be drafted &quot;as quickly as possible&quot; to remove Mandelson’s right to sit in the Lords if he did not step down himself.
