<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced on November 12, 2025, that they had concluded negotiations on a new bilateral security treaty that they plan to sign next year, describing it as a step to deepen cooperation on regional stability. The agreement commits both governments to regular leader- and minister-level consultations on security concerns and to facilitate mutually beneficial security activities, including measures to consider if either country’s security is threatened. Leaders said the pact builds on a 2024 defence agreement and is intended to strengthen practical cooperation between the neighbours without specifying detailed operational clauses publicly yet.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uusyo3wBNHAd_xvIwgj7ivTFtGeOF0zAfjzmiFD_FTURr2Qmyq5ZYRNcGvBaJRYHwJflSRDoUfe-YXdmDojhfmf3PSvw5CtsP1LL7LvcZl52O4TmRQLt_16IRWYO93vqXfnnxtBBzEgkC15d7CeRbe23iyLf-m-Z2NhdgqevgtOShuyboKUagKM64b-k2k2EfC778GCJSUVlXLULeYIsX0Z66ef9Z3G0twNBvR3jkTrHNJZ5MiIjkkU0vxlI' alt='Anthony Albanese and Prabowo Subianto announced they had struck a major security pact between Australia and Indonesia.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Operational scope: The treaty will facilitate &#x27;mutually beneficial security activities&#x27; and builds on provisions that allowed each country&#x27;s forces to operate in the other&#x27;s territory, suggesting expanded practical cooperation beyond consultation.</li><li>Strategic context: Analysts say the pact comes as Canberra has moved closer to Washington while Jakarta has sought a more neutral regional posture, so the deal balances deeper bilateral ties with Jakarta&#x27;s caution about provoking Beijing.</li><li>Announcement setting: Officials unveiled the deal during a joint appearance at a Royal Australian Navy base in Sydney after what Albanese called &#x27;substantive&#x27; negotiations, underscoring the defence focus of the talks.</li></ul><blockquote>We cannot choose our neighbours … especially countries like us - Prabowo Subianto</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Anthony Albanese (Australian prime minister): Albanese said the treaty recognises that the best way to secure peace and stability in the region is by acting together and reported substantive completion of negotiations in Sydney on November 12, 2025.
