<p>It’s hard to believe, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a>’s classic 1967 recording of “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” was originally rejected by his record label.</p>
<p>The song, about a man’s grief over hearing rumors of his lover’s infidelity,&nbsp;was written by the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motown">Motown Records</a> producer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/arts/music/18whitfield.html">Norman Whitfield</a> and singer <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/barrett-strong-mn0000117001">Barrett Strong</a>. Smokey Robinson and the Miracles&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH0Tzx5brVE">first recorded</a> the track in 1966, but that version got nixed by Motown founder Berry Gordy during a weekly quality control meeting. Then, Whitfield recorded the song with Gaye in early 1967, but for some reason Gordy didn’t like that version either. So Whitfield changed the lyrics a bit and recorded it with Gladys Knight and the Pips. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah1cvL_ez-M">fast-tempo arrangement</a>, influenced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3Itb17PXvw">Aretha Franklin’s “Respect,”</a>&nbsp;was released as a single in September of 1967 and rose to number one on the Billboard R&amp;B chart.</p>
<p>Gaye’s version might have been forgotten had it not been included in his 1968 album,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwjjnUa3xNw&amp;list=PLH_QLWlQVieVhBCUweAEYDD_Lc4RJ_XWb"><em>In the Groove</em></a>, where it soon became noticed. “The DJs played it so much off the album,” Gordy said later, “that we had to release it as a single.”</p>

<p>Gaye’s recording of the song became a crossover hit. It rose not only to the top of the R&amp;B charts, but also spent seven weeks at the top of the Billboard Pop Singles chart. It was Motown’s biggest-selling single up to that time, and the <em>In the Groove</em> album name was soon changed to <em>I Heard It Through the Grapevine</em>.</p>
<p>Gaye was known for his sweet-sounding tenor voice, which he could modulate from a baritone to a silky high falsetto. During the “Grapevine” sessions, the singer reportedly quarreled with Whitfield over the producer’s insistence that he sing the song in a high rasp. Whitfield prevailed, and Gaye’s performance is one of the greatest of the Motown era. You can hear his classic vocals “a cappella” in the video above. And for a reminder of Whitfield’s classic arrangement, with its pulsing electric piano introduction and shimmering strings, see the video below. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Funk_Brothers">The Funk Brothers</a>, the legendary Motown backing group, played on the track, as did the backing vocal group The Andantes and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.</p>
