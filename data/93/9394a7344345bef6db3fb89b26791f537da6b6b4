<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Below I&rsquo;ve listed couple of ways to use terminal that some people may not know about.
These &ldquo;technics&rdquo; I use a lot in may daily hacking.<br/>
So let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<h2>CTRL+R</h2>
I'm sure you already know that you can travel through command history using ⇧ and ⇩ keys.
But sometimes the command you're looking for is far behind in history so you should do something like this
```
⇧⇧⇧⇧⇧ damn, I missed it ⇩⇩ here is <enter>
```
which is quite annoying.
<p><strong>CTRL+R</strong> allows you to search through command history. <br/>
Here is the demo:</p>

<p>You can go deeper in history with the same keystroke (CTRL+R). To go forward in history press <strong>CTRL+S</strong></p>
<p>This keystroke I just can&rsquo;t live without and use it all the time.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h2>Movements/Editing</h2>
Of course I do not use **CTRL+R** just to find previously entered command
since it can be easily found with ⇧ key. But, I really do not like to move my hands outside of my keyboard's
homerow. Usually all terminals supports emacs keybinding <br/>
So meet:
<br/>
<a target="_blank" href="https://codelearn.me/assets/img/arrows.png"><img alt="emacs arrows" src="https://codelearn.me/assets/img/arrows.png" width="300px"/></a>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;ll replace <strong>CTRL</strong> with <strong>ALT</strong> for arrow left/right keys you will be able to follow back and forth word by word.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is more tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can also use <strong>ALT</strong> key with <strong>BACKSPACE</strong> which will delete WORD instead of SYMBOL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can remove symbol under cursor with <strong>CTRL+D</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using <strong>CTRL+A</strong> will move your cursor to the beginning of the command line</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CTRL+K</strong> will remove everything from cursor to the end of command line</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, using <strong>CTRL+A</strong> + <strong>CTRL+K</strong> removes everything you already entered, which is much faster than long
press on backspace.
<br/>
<br/></p>
<h2>CTRL+L</h2>
<p>Just a <strong>clear</strong> command, which clears your terminal window. I like when my typing happens
at the top of terminal window 😜 so it is very useful for me.
I hope it can be something good for you as well.</p>
