James Dyer has announced a new package called <a href="https://emacs.dyerdwelling.family/emacs/20250704224318-emacs--new-package-simply-annotate-a-lightweight-annotation-system/">Simply Annotate</a>. It is, as the name suggests, a package to make annotations to a file with the feature that the original file is not modified. There are, of course, as Dyer says plenty of packages that do this sort of thing but he wanted a light weight package that specifically met his needs and preferences.

Dyer has a list of those preferences, which you can read at his post or you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/captainflasmr/simply-annotate/blob/main/docs/simply-annotate.org">the user manual</a>. Regardless, it appears to have some nice features. Dyer has an animation that shows how the system works. The package is available <a href="https://melpa.org/#/simply-annotate">on Melpa</a> or directly from its <a href="https://github.com/captainflasmr/simply-annotate">GitHub page</a>. There&rsquo;s plenty of information on Dyer&rsquo;s post, which appears to be essentially the same as the GitHub README.

I&rsquo;ve tried very hard in the past to warm up to applications like this. After all, they make perfect sense: you can make personal notes concerning the file content without altering the file itself. I spent a certain amount of time making such notes but then never—ever—actually read them. I reluctantly concluded that such things were not for me. But they may be just right for you so you should definitely take a look.</p>
