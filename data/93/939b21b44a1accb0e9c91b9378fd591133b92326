<p id="p2">Text messages are a chronicle of our lives. But by the same token, those conversations remain locked away in Messages. The app&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macos-26-tahoe-the-macstories-review/4/#messages" rel="noopener noreferrer">search has improved with macOS Tahoe</a>, which I appreciate, but finding past snippets of a chat log doesn&rsquo;t allow you to understand the full arc of conversations across your entire family and friend group.</p>
<p id="p3">That&rsquo;s where <a href="https://www.remess.me" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remess</a> by <a href="https://www.fahmi.lol" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fahmi Omer</a> comes in. It&rsquo;s a Mac app that accesses your Messages and Contacts databases locally to paint a picture of your life in text messages.</p>
<p id="p4">To run Remess, which is <a href="https://github.com/FO214/remess" rel="noopener noreferrer">an open source project that you can inspect on GitHub</a>, you need to run a Terminal command that bypasses Apple&rsquo;s Gatekeeper protection and give it both full disk access and access to your contacts. The developer says the app only accesses your information locally, but there&rsquo;s an element of trust there that&rsquo;s worth considering before you take the plunge. That said, if you go for it like I did, Remess is a lot of fun.</p>
<p id="p5">Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p id="p6">The app starts out very high level with the total number of messages sent and received:</p>

<p id="p8">Then, it digs into the details. This is what writing at MacStories for nearly a decade looks like:</p>

<p id="p10">From all-time numbers, Remess digs into what a typical day of texting looks like for you:</p>

<p id="p12">The app also calculates the year you sent the most messages and how many people you&rsquo;ve exchanged texts. After this brief tour of your life in texts, Remess lands on a dashboard with additional data, a graph of your texting totals, a word cloud of most frequently-used words, and a ranking of your contacts and groups ranked by texting totals.</p>

<p id="p14">You can filter texting totals by year, too, which is an interesting way to spot patterns in your messaging habits.</p>

<p id="p16">I&rsquo;m not sure I learned anything about my texting habits from Remess that I didn&rsquo;t already have a sense of based on my day-to-day messaging. Still, it&rsquo;s interesting and fun to see the magnitude of the number of texts and the way they&rsquo;ve accumulated over time.</p>
