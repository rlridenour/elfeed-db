<blockquote>
  <p>Sony released the first game in the <em>Horizon</em> series, <em>Horizon:
Zero Dawn</em>, on its PlayStation 4 in 2017. The games follow a
red-headed woman named Aloy as she navigates a post-apocalyptic
world populated by human tribes and robotic animals.</p>

<p>Sony said in its complaint that it declined an offer from Tencent
to collaborate on a new <em>Horizon</em> game last year. Tencent later
announced <em>Light of Motiram</em>, which Sony said features identical
gameplay, story themes and artistic elements to <em>Horizon</em> as well
as many other similarities.</p>

<p>Sony said that video game journalists have characterized <em>Light of
Motiram</em> as a “knock-off” of <em>Horizon</em>, including one who called
the game <em>Horizon Zero Originality</em>.</p>
