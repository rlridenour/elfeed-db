<div class='github_readme_md'><p>The <a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/pre-commit-elisp">pre-commit-elisp</a> repository offers pre-commit hooks for <strong>Emacs Lisp (Elisp)</strong> projects. These hooks enforce code quality and consistency by performing automated checks on <code>.el</code> files prior to committing changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>elisp-check-parens</code></strong>: Validates that all parentheses in <code>.el</code> files are correctly balanced.</li>
<li><strong><code>elisp-check-byte-compile</code></strong>: Byte-compile Elisp files to detect compilation errors.</li>
<li><strong><code>elisp-indent</code></strong>: Indent Elisp files according to Emacs Lisp style conventions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These pre-commit hooks enforce syntactic correctness, successful byte-compilation, and consistent code formatting, ensuring a high standard of code quality and maintainability throughout the repository.</p>
<p>If this enhances your workflow, please show your support by <strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/17.0.2/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> starring pre-commit-elisp on GitHub</strong> to help more Emacs users discover its benefits.</p>

<h2>Customizations</h2>
<h4>Customizing load-path</h4>
<p>Scripts such as <code>elisp-check-byte-compile</code> and <code>elisp-byte-compile</code> support customizing the <code>load-path</code> variable using a <code>.dir-locals.el</code> variable <code>pre-commit-elisp-load-path</code>. This variable allows specifying the directories that should be included in the <code>load-path</code> without modifying the scripts themselves, ensuring that dependencies and libraries located in the project or its subdirectories are correctly available for byte-compilation.</p>
<p>Customizing the <code>load-path</code> allows the byte-compilation scripts, such as <code>elisp-check-byte-compile</code>, to <strong>find and load project-specific Emacs Lisp files</strong> during compilation.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a <code>.dir-locals.el</code> file to place at the root of the Git repository:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elisp">((nil . ((pre-commit-elisp-load-path . ("." "lib/" "utils")))))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pre-commit-elisp-load-path</code> list is a <strong>list of directories</strong> relative to the Git repository root or project directory.</p>
<p>Each entry in the list determines how it is added to <code>load-path</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Directory ends with a slash (<code>/</code>)</strong>: Recursively adds the directory and all its subdirectories to <code>load-path</code>. Example: <code>"lib/"</code> adds <code>lib/</code> and all its subdirectories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Directory does not end with a slash</strong>: The directory is added non-recursively. Example: <code>"utils"</code> adds only the <code>utils</code> directory, not its subdirectories.</p>
</li>
</ol>
