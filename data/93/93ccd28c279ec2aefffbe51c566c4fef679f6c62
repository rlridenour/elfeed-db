<p>Australia has begun enforcing a national ban on social media accounts for anyone under 16, requiring major platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat to delete existing underage profiles and block new ones from 10 December 2025. The law, framed as an online safety measure, obliges platforms to take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to verify users’ ages without demanding official ID, and threatens non‑compliant companies with penalties that can reach tens of millions of dollars. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and child-safety advocates, including a 12‑year‑old activist, say the move is about protecting young people from cyberbullying, addictive design and harmful content, and about shifting power from tech giants back to families and regulators. Technology firms, digital rights groups and many teenagers warn that the rules are hard to enforce, risk pushing young users to less regulated apps, and may sideline teens from social connection and information, turning the policy into a closely watched global experiment that other governments are studying but not yet copying.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/5ze_O61PoYLpUO29eazUzTyL_dBiWt1iYgLaYoBEj7aatjM-kQAPu5x-A3RqBfWKgQ54tlmCAzFDjH0eqNuxFlEMZt3EX-5U8cop0ouUJdnHh7AGSGoAQLfbzthJSFk6jwEX3H9nPSpWo_3Vr9cTzbB2Nov_nymfAeMyelekNGMD4W-QAtTA3olqqR6KkTWa-YTv5y5OYsDTIPiMsIA' alt='Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stands with 12-year-old campaigner Flossie at an event marking the start of Australia’s youth social media ban in Sydney.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>How it works: Under Australia’s Online Safety Amendment, platforms must flag likely under-16 accounts using signals such as viewing habits, activity patterns and user photos, then remove or block them if age cannot be confirmed.</li><li>Goodbye posts: In the hours before enforcement, some Australian children posted farewell messages with hashtags like &quot;#seeyouwhenim16&quot; as their accounts disappeared or were locked.</li><li>Verification tech: Age checks may rely on tools like AI-based selfie analysis, bank-account cross‑checks, specialist age‑estimation services such as Yoti or K‑ID, and behavioural monitoring, each raising privacy and accuracy concerns among experts.</li><li>Youth workarounds: Teenagers report using VPNs, fake birth dates, altered selfies and beauty filters to evade automated checks, with some still able to access their feeds on day one of the ban.</li><li>Global watchers: Officials and lawmakers in Denmark, Malaysia, Norway, India and the European Union are examining similar age-based restrictions or resolutions, treating Australia’s approach as a test case rather than an immediate template.</li></ul><blockquote>We’re taking back control from big tech and giving it back to parents and the community. - Anthony Albanese, prime minister of Australia</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Australian government: Prime Minister Anthony Albanese describes the law as a way to &quot;take back control&quot; from large technology firms by forcing them to remove under-16 accounts or face heavy fines, arguing that it will help protect children’s mental health and wellbeing online.
