What do I want from gardening?
2025-09-08-01
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lettuce for salad</li>
<li>As many cherry tomatoes as we can eat and share</li>
<li>Marigolds, roses:  Colour, play</li>
<li>Radishes are fun too</li>
<li>Perilla leaves</li>
<li>Basil</li>
<li>Mint</li>
<li>Green onions, chives</li>
<li>Lavender</li>
<li>Bitter melon for W-</li>
<li>Small cucumbers</li>
<li>Strawberries</li>
</ul>

<p>
Overall:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Things we use a little of at a time</li>
<li>Things that are very tasty</li>
</ul>


<p>
Next step: Add more to soil to get more out of it:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>replace front garden with compost &amp; radishes</li>
<li>get the pots set up for lettuce</li>
</ul>

<p>
Things that get in the way:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Heat</li>
<li>Poor soil weeds &gt; seeds</li>
<li>Other priorities</li>
<li>Waiting</li>
</ul>

<p>
First frost: ~ Oct 13
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>get strawberries back in the ground</li>
<li>another crop of lettuce &amp; radishes</li>
</ul>


</details>

<p>
The weather's getting cooler. I probably have a
couple of weeks more before the cherry tomatoes
get too cold. A+ hasn't been interested in
harvesting them lately, so I get to do the
tomato-picking now. We have a little over a month
until the usual first frost in Toronto. I moved
the strawberries to pots during spring/summer so
that I could keep them in a cage away from
squirrels, but now it's time to put them in the
ground. I'll see if I can still pick up some
compost from the garden store so that I can amend
the soil before I replant the strawberries. It's a
good time for me to get some more lettuce and
radishes going, too.
