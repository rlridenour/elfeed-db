<p>I’ve changed the way I access my most used files in Obsidian, on my iPhone. Prepare to be completely underwhelmed! What I’m doing now is so simple<a href="#footnote-1YU8" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1YU8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, it’s a wonder it has taken me so long to get here.</p>
<p><a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/09/29/ptpl-175-calendar-txt-simplest-time-planning-system" title="wikilink">Last week</a> I mentioned that I’m taking the opportunity to organise my time and tasks differently, while away visiting family for a couple of weeks. Both the visit and the digital change of pace have been a joy so far! And even more so, now that I can see what I need to do and where I need to be, distraction-free.</p>
<h3 id="four-basic-text-files">Four basic text files</h3>
<p>Four text files form the bedrock of how I’m manually capturing information and organising my time and tasks.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong><span class="small-caps">OBTF</span></strong> - One big text file as a scratchpad for the entire year</li>
<li><strong>calendar.txt</strong> - For appointments and time blocking</li>
<li><strong>todo.txt</strong> - For capturing tasks and deciding when to do them</li>
<li><strong>today</strong> - For listing tomorrow’s tasks</li>
</ol>
<p>In the past Obsidian automatically opened to my <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span>, where links to my other most used files would be the first thing I saw. I’ve taken it a step further by also making those links into sweet little icons on the Home Screen of my iPhone.</p>
<h2 id="the-4-text-files-explained">The 4 text files, explained</h2>
<p>Before I explain how to do that, here is a closer look at the files themselves.</p>
<h3 id="obtf-one-big-text-file"><span class="small-caps">OBTF</span> (One Big Text File)</h3>
<p>This file is for information you need to keep, half-formed thoughts, and anything else that doesn’t yet have a specific home. The power of it lies in only having one place to search for that thing you wrote down<a href="#footnote-2YU8" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-2YU8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Number one rule: date every entry (YYYY-MM-DD, e.g.&nbsp;2025-10-03). At the top of the file are links to notes I access regularly. New entries are added to the bottom. I use this file intermittently. You might not need it at all if you already have a way of capturing information that works for you. <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/04/14/obtf-start-here" title="wikilink">Read more about <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span></a></p>
<h3 id="calendar.txt">calendar.txt</h3>
<p>If it’s meant to happen on a particular date at a particular time, write it on the same line as that day’s date.</p>
<p>Stripping away the usual format of a calendar has been such an interesting exercise! With zero reminders in place, I check my text calendar religiously, every day. This repetition means I’m remembering my schedule better than before, similar to how calendars and brains worked together in the pre-digital era. I don’t know how long I’ll stick with it; probably until friction pushes me back to using a dedicated app.</p>
<p><span class="small-caps">FYI</span>: My files are named calendar-txt.md and todo-txt.md because Obsidian works with Markdown files<a href="#footnote-3YU8" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-3YU8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>P.S. For visual cues to year, month, and week divisions, I’ve added coloured emojis. I.e. <code>2026 🟥</code>, <code>2025-10 🟧</code>, <code>2025-10-06 🟨</code>. <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/09/29/ptpl-175-calendar-txt-simplest-time-planning-system" title="wikilink">Read more about calendar.txt</a></p>
<h3 id="todo.txt">todo.txt</h3>
<p>This time around I’m not feeling the need for (A), (B), (C) priorities, but they are still an option. The priority of a task indicated by the order of tasks in my <em>today</em> list. My tasks start with the date they were created, then the time sector<a href="#footnote-4YU8" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-4YU8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I plan to do (or review) them in, the task itself, and then any associated projects.</p>
<p>There’s a Todo.txt mode plugin in Obsidian<a href="#footnote-5YU8" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-5YU8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> that gives you syntax highlighting (and a few other todo.txt features), yay! <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/01/20/ptpl-140-todo.txt-in-obsidian-1" title="wikilink">Read more about todo.txt</a></p>
<h3 id="today">today</h3>
<p>You don’t need this list, but perhaps you will want it, as I do. A separate, manually put together daily task list can help you be more intentional about your day. In the past I’ve assigned priority or <code>today</code> tags to tasks and let my task manager prepare my daily list. It makes sense to do things that way, but I still prefer a separate, hand made task list.</p>
<p>My favourite part is being able to shift items up and down the list with a keyboard shortcut (Mac) or one tap (iPhone), to indicate priority.</p>
<p>I write my <code>today</code> list the night before, keeping in mind the time I will have available between appointments. It’s the digital equivalent of writing today’s tasks in my <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/09/01/ptpl-171-edc-one-page-notebook" title="wikilink">1-page notebook</a>. Completed tasks are deleted, then marked off in the todo.txt file at the end of the day or during weekly review sessions.</p>
<h2 id="double-handling-isnt-always-a-bad-thing">Double handling isn’t always a bad thing</h2>
<p>The double-handling this system requires does not need to be arduous or painful. In fact, I find it helps me to keep focused. I’m better able to retain the bigger picture in my brain, rather than relying on an app to show it to me.</p>
<p>There is something powerful about knowing that when I see a particular piece of information, be it a repeating task or calendar event, <em>I</em> put it there. Not some repeat-every-second-week button in an app. <em>Me</em>. I trust my manual system more than I trusted apps to get it right.</p>
<p>If you are convinced that a manual calendar or task list <em>would</em> be painful for you, if you’re put off by the very idea, then I have two things to say: First — Why are you still reading this?!?! Second — There are no prizes for choosing text files over dedicated apps; if it’s not for you, it’s not for you.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-the-shortcuts">How to create the shortcuts</h2>
<p>Now that you understand the foundation, let’s look at how to put shortcuts to your most used files right where you will see them, every day.</p>
<p>To add an icon (that looks like an app) to your iPhone Home Screen, which takes you directly to a specific Obsidian file:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the file in Obsidian</li>
<li>Click on the three dots in the upper right hand of the screen, and choose <code>Copy Obsidian URL</code></li>
<li>Go to the Shortcuts app (on iOS or Mac) and click the <code>+</code> to add a new shortcut</li>
<li>Enter<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><span class="small-caps">URL</span><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> into the search bar and select the option that simply says <code>URL</code></li>
<li>Paste the Obsidian <span class="small-caps">URL</span> copied in step 2 into the <span class="small-caps">URL</span> box</li>
<li>Enter<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><span class="small-caps">URL</span><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> into the search bar again, and select the option that says <code>Open URL</code></li>
<li>Tap on the title at the top of the screen, and select <code>Rename</code>. Give the shortcut a name.</li>
<li>Tap the Share icon (rectangle with up arrow), then <code>Add to Home Screen</code></li>
<li>Choose a photo, or a colour and an icon</li>
<li>Click <code>Add</code></li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have a neat icon on your Home Screen that opens directly to your target file in Obsidian. (If it doesn’t work for you, let me know which part tripped you up.)</p>
<h3 id="creating-shortcuts-on-android-devices">Creating shortcuts on Android devices</h3>
<p>Thanks to Paul Wilson, a kind, long-time reader, here’s how to create similar shortcuts on Android devices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Install the Markor app. Set the default notepad directory to wherever you have these files on your phone (mine are held in a folder inside my obsidian vault and then synced to the phone using dropsync).</p>
<p>Then in Markor, navigate to the file and press on the three dots in top right corner…&nbsp;.there is an option to<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>create shortcut”, select it, then it asks if you want to<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Add to home screen” - answer <span class="small-caps">OKAY</span>. I use the Niagara launcher and it adds the file as a new icon at the bottom of the favourites list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>These instructions were first shared in a comment on the <a href="https://ppmw99.medium.com/thank-you-ellane-for-this-post-83198d88fa39" target="_blank">Medium</a> version of this post.</em></p>
<h2 id="use-the-apps-you-love-but-remember-that-you-dont-actually-need-them">Use the apps you love but remember that you don’t actually need them</h2>
<p>Maybe I should feel silly for only now discovering it is possible to link to specific Obsidian files right from my Home Screen, but I don’t<a href="#footnote-6YU8" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-6YU8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. I’m here now, and it’s great fun!</p>
<p>The best thing about the way I use Obsidian is that I don’t specifically need <em>Obsidian</em> to do what I’m doing in it.</p>
<p>I don’t <em>need</em> Obsidian but I surely do appreciate the little things that make it a joy to use. That’s why I pay for their Sync service. iCloud works okay too, these days, I’m told.</p>
<p>Four text files (<span class="small-caps">OBTF</span>, todo-txt, calendar-txt, today) support me right now, where I am. I’m not out to convince you to use all of them or even any of them, but hear this: you should absolutely be <em>able</em> to successfully organise both your time and tasks with raw text in one or more plain text documents, or with simple pen and paper.<a href="#footnote-7YU8" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-7YU8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Modern apps are fantastic; I’m all for them and the convenience and power they can bring to our lives. But too many of us forget we can get by without them!</p>
<p>The truth is that you do not need fancy apps to track your time or your tasks, and you don’t need my cute little shortcuts, either. Text Edit files on your desktop would do the job. But then I never was all about absolute minimalism, digital or otherwise!</p>
<p>So, yeah. Use your apps, enjoy your apps, but don’t outsource your thinking to them. Keep that wonderful, miraculous brain of yours toned by keeping it involved in the process of organising your life.</p>
<h2 id="up-for-a-challenge">Up for a challenge?</h2>
<p>In the spirit of challenges like <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/01/inktober-index" title="wikilink">Inktober</a> (which I’m participating in again this year) perhaps you might like to see how you go tracking your life in plain text for a month. If you do, please let me know how it went! (What did you learn? Did it feel like a dopamine detox? What did you miss the most?)</p>
