<p>The US Senate on Sunday advanced a House-passed stopgap funding bill in a 60-40 procedural vote, taking the first clear step toward ending the 40-day partial government shutdown that began on Oct. 1. The move followed an agreement by a group of moderate Democrats to proceed without a guaranteed extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, a concession that split their caucus and drew criticism from progressives. The measure will be amended in the Senate to include additional funding language — reports say it is intended to keep federal agencies funded into late January — and still requires final passage in the Senate, approval in the House and the signature of President Trump before furloughed workers are paid and services fully restart.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/iP1aN8kGqUpW19VspHwjuJn_0hzQ7vUe2if8-9ZPi48C9nPcrL72oZ7s5JPrSI59lkft-mYwuula3uPXD0d81l0lOmInc3HRiIWF9cVsh0ijlpvsj7BrXzCBEOpZg0KUYJp0Xc1oJu7HDS0c3POIJKdpkhTMDudcGQN-HNA5-_o1Sd5ZjzUyJMof4ia0tP57bGEWIGBJOC8R6f32hgTVJ0Rr3hH8r_chcGGRPneLoPWExCRnyGCRcHNTg8k5Jco7wJebVIIqxupHr1zqhw' alt='A view of the US Capitol building during the shutdown, illustrating the legislative site of the funding debate.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Democratic split: Eight Democratic senators joined Republicans to advance the bill, prompting sharp criticism from within the Democratic caucus for accepting no immediate guarantee on health-subsidy extensions</li><li>Legislative path: Senators plan to amend the House stopgap to combine a short-term measure with three full-year appropriations bills before final votes, and the package still needs House approval and the president&#x27;s signature</li><li>Federal workforce: The proposed compromise would bar agencies from firing employees until January 30 and has been framed as a win for federal worker unions amid concerns about pending federal downsizing</li><li>Economic and security costs: Business and security disruptions during the shutdown have included delayed food aid, snarled air travel and more than $5 billion in held arms exports to NATO partners, according to reports warning of wider economic damage</li></ul><blockquote>It looks like we&#x27;re getting very close to the shutdown ending - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: The president said the shutdown appears close to ending and welcomed procedural progress while noting the final steps remain.
