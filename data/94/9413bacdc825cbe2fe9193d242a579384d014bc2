<p>Ukrainian and US representatives wrapped up three days of talks in Florida on a US-led peace plan for the war in Ukraine, with both sides describing the discussions as constructive but acknowledging no breakthrough yet toward a final agreement. President Volodymyr Zelensky joined the negotiations remotely from Kyiv, calling his call with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner &quot;very substantive and constructive&quot; and stressing that Ukraine remains committed to working &quot;honestly&quot; with Washington for a &quot;real&quot; and durable peace. According to Axios reporting cited by Russian media, the most difficult part of the conversation concerned Russia-related territorial issues, while participants reportedly moved closer on possible US security guarantees for Ukraine. The talks follow an earlier version of the US peace proposal that Kyiv and several European partners saw as too close to Russia&#x27;s demands, prompting revisions as the US team under President Trump seeks a swift settlement to a conflict now approaching its fourth year.</p><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who attended: Ukraine was represented in Florida by chief negotiator Rustem Umerov and armed forces chief of staff Andriy Gnatov, while the US side was led by President Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and presidential adviser Jared Kushner.</li><li>Format of talks: The main negotiating rounds took place over three days in Miami, with Zelensky participating via a long call from Kyiv during which the parties agreed on next steps and an updated format for continuing discussions with the American side.</li><li>Territorial disputes: Axios reporting cited by Russian media said discussions over territory were described as &quot;difficult,&quot; with Ukraine rejecting Russia’s demand that its forces withdraw from areas of Donbass it regards as occupied, while US negotiators looked for ways to bridge this gap.</li><li>Security guarantees progress: Despite disagreements over land, the same Axios-based account reported that the delegations made &quot;significant progress&quot; and came close to agreement on the structure of US security guarantees meant to deter any future large-scale Russian assault on Ukraine.</li><li>Russian position: Russian officials, after meeting Witkoff and Kushner in Moscow days earlier, said those talks were &quot;very useful and constructive,&quot; while President Vladimir Putin has publicly insisted Ukraine must accept Russia’s declared new borders, renounce NATO membership, and withdraw its troops from Donbass or face continued military pressure there.</li></ul><blockquote>Ukraine is committed to continuing to work honestly with the American side to bring about real peace - Volodymyr Zelensky</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukrainian government: Zelensky characterized his call with Witkoff and Kushner as &quot;very substantive and constructive&quot; and emphasized that Ukraine wants an agreement that genuinely ends bloodshed and prevents a further Russian invasion or renewed non-compliance with any future commitments.
