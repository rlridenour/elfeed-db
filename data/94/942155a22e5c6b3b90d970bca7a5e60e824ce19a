<p>Demolition crews began tearing down part of the White House’s East Wing on Monday to make way for a new ballroom that President Trump has said will be privately funded and cost about $250 million [dawn.com#1][firstpost.com#1]. The East Wing — which has housed the first lady’s offices, a theatre and a visitor entrance — was visibly stripped as heavy equipment worked on the facade, and the White House declined to comment on Monday about why walls were removed despite earlier assurances they would not be touched [dawn.com#1]. Images of the work spread quickly online and prompted criticism from Democrats and preservation advocates even as the President said the project would be &quot;beautiful&quot; and paid for by himself and donors [allsides.com#1][dawn.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/KmskdPgeswuVMzbpsHzYXqmKzDlzstiALvf_gO_zAzvHuEn7-Bz4Nd_i0rRtas7Z3bZ_Mjhr5s8U-ADSsgY3ZMj-G9TxCci6fidrAzHM' alt='A demolition crew takes apart the facade of the East Wing of the White House.—Reuters' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Project scale: Officials and coverage describe the planned ballroom as a very large expansion, which Firstpost reports will be roughly 90,000 square feet and the biggest White House expansion in modern history [firstpost.com#1].</li><li>East Wing functions: The East Wing has long contained the first lady’s offices, a theatre and the visitor entrance where foreign dignitaries enter, functions that will be affected by the construction work [dawn.com#1].</li><li>Public reaction: Photographs and video of an excavator tearing into the facade circulated widely on Monday and provoked immediate backlash from critics who see the work as altering a historic presidential property [allsides.com#1].</li><li>Presidential response: President Trump publicly downplayed criticism and celebrated progress on the site, telling visitors construction noise was &#x27;music to my ears&#x27; as the work continued [scmp.com#1][straitstimes.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>It will be beautiful.
