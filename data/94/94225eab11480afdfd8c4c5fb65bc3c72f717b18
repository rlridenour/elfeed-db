<p>A South Korean special prosecutor has indicted former president Yoon Suk Yeol, accusing him of ordering drone flights over North Korea to create a pretext for declaring martial law last December, prosecutors said on Monday. The new charges include allegations of aiding the enemy and other national security violations; prosecutors say the plan was part of a bid to stoke tensions that would justify emergency rule. The indictment adds to an ongoing legal crisis: Yoon was removed from office earlier this year and remains the subject of multiple probes and a separate insurrection trial.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/HPBnKSmXHA75Y80bUe9tOB50niD_AloT7QuwWQMQ258_FN9xUCMM0_i6VkJRUNc2ExtfS3ND7lLb67wBliOoCL-VnJ_lvjxH8Ki8LDF1RqMqiBaO76_VNVVUYPy161lNztS9F_CikSu_6wqXmlz7FzWGpS3fg8zFZ_ouKCJ25TYMbdFdstRvfPaZ_PcosiNu8z0NKE8hZa5dPsbE' alt='Yoon Suk Yeol, former president of South Korea, arriving at his trial in Seoul in April; prosecutors say he ordered drone flights to justify martial law [nytimes.com#1].' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Specific charges: Prosecutors charged Yoon with aiding the enemy and national security violations tied to the alleged drone flights and related actions.</li><li>Parliament confrontation: Investigators say Yoon dispatched armed soldiers to the National Assembly to try to stop lawmakers from blocking his martial law declaration in December 2024.</li><li>Special investigation: A special probe opened earlier this year focused on whether Yoon ordered the drone operations, producing evidence that led to Monday&#x27;s indictment.</li><li>Courtroom presence: Yoon has already appeared in court this year during hearings related to his brief martial law declaration and his broader legal troubles.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Special prosecutor&#x27;s office: Prosecutors say Yoon ordered drone flights into North Korea to create a pretext for declaring martial law and to provoke a military incident that would justify emergency powers.
