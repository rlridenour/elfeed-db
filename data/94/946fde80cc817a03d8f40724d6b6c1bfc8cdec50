<p>You may not know it, but there’s an app built right into your iPhone, iPad, and Mac that can supercharge your experience using all those products — and it’s about to get even more powerful.</p>
<p>That app is Shortcuts, and it lets you automate tasks on your devices, even across apps. You can have it do everything from a simple job of creating a GIF of a Live Photo to a complex system that lets you annotate a podcast as you’re recording it, and way, way more.</p>
<p>You build these workflows in the Shortcuts app by selecting actions and stringing them together: passing information from, say, the clipboard and having the system scan any text in the image, and then overlay it on an image you specify in order to create a meme. With this year’s updates to Apple’s platforms previewed at WWDC 2025, Shortcuts is able to do even more, including leveraging Apple Intelligence features and automating actions on the Mac.</p>
<p>That will make this automation tool even more versatile and able to handle more complex tasks than ever before—even if it still has some flaws that could stand addressing.</p>
