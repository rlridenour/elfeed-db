An upgrade to ChatGPT-5 integration is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/08/ios-26-chatgpt-5-integration-apple-intelligence/">planned for Siri</a> with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, aiming to improve reasoning capabilities. The next-generation version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is now being <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/10/apple-testing-new-siri-in-apps-report/">tested with third-party apps</a> including Uber, AllTrails, Threads, Temu, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook, and WhatsApp. A more advanced large language model-based &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, which will be more powerful than the "personalized" &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, could launch as early as next spring. A visually redesigned &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interface for iPhones and iPads is also under consideration for release in 2026.<br/>
<br/>
The company is said to be recruiting engineers for its "Answers, Knowledge, and Information" team tasked with enhancing &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, Spotlight, Safari, and other services. This team is in the early stages of creating a "new ChatGPT-like search experience" and is even exploring the possibility of a standalone "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/03/apple-hiring-for-answers-team/">answer engine</a>" app.<br/>
<br/>
The next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> is expected to launch this year and will shift further toward the smart home. It will incorporate <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/homepod-mini-new-chip/">Apple's "S11" chip</a>, a new Apple-designed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 6E support, and potentially a second-generation ultra-wideband chip for enhanced spatial awareness. The refresh may also bring improved sound quality alongside new color options. Likewise, a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> is expected to launch this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/">with the A17 Pro chip</a> and the new Apple-designed Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Apple's first smart home hub is now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-smart-home-hub-2026/">expected in 2026</a> and will feature a 7-inch display paired with an integrated speaker, taking visual cues from Google's Nest Hub with a square display, thin black or white bezels, rounded corners, and a half-dome-shaped base. Designed for shared household use, its interface will emphasize clock faces and widgets for core Apple apps, including Calendar, Camera, Music, Reminders, and Notes. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could feature a new visual interface, personified and inspired by the Mac Finder icon. The device will include a front-facing camera to deliver personalized content and features for each user, but it will not run third-party apps or have an app store. It is rumored to heavily rely on the next-generation version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also believed to be working on a Ring-style <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-home-security-camera/">home security camera</a> with facial recognition and motion detection to trigger home automations. Battery life is apparently being designed to last several months to a year. A facial recognition doorbell is also in development. The camera could debut alongside the 2026 smart home hub.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, a so-called Apple "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-launching-robot-virtual-companion-in-2027/">robot companion</a>" is in the prototyping stage, targeted for a 2027 launch. It will feature a 7-inch iPad-like display mounted on a movable arm that can rotate and extend about six inches in any direction—nicknamed internally as the "Pixar lamp." Apple envisions it as an AI-driven household companion, powered by an advanced &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capable of remembering information, engaging in more natural conversations, and presenting a "visual personality." The device could proactively interrupt with suggestions and be similar to OpenAI's voice mode. It will include Center Stage as well as joystick-controlled camera movement to show different parts of a room during calls.<br/>
