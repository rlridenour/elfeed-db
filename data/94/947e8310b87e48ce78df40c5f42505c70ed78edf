<p>MacPaw&nbsp;<a href="https://macpaw.com/news/macpaw-introduces-cloud-cleanup">just announced Cloud Cleanup</a>, a new feature that brings&nbsp;<a href="https://cleanmymac.com/">CleanMyMac</a>&#8216;s cleaning capabilities to your cloud storage accounts. As someone who relies on CleanMyMac, I&#8217;m happy to see the app tackle yet another common problem: managing the mess in my cloud storage.</p>



<p>Cloud Cleanup extends CleanMyMac&#8217;s functionality beyond your local Mac and into cloud storage services like iCloud, Google Drive, and OneDrive. The feature offers two cleanup methods:&nbsp;<strong>Remove</strong>&nbsp;(deletes unnecessary files from cloud accounts) and&nbsp;<strong>Unsync</strong>&nbsp;(removes local copies while keeping files in the cloud).</p>



<p>You get a tile-based dashboard showing key insights for each connected account, plus smart alerts when unused files are detected or storage limits are near. The feature works entirely on-device without saving or accessing any files in your cloud storage, connecting through existing desktop apps.</p>



<p>Starting July 29, 2025, Cloud Cleanup is available exclusively in CleanMyMac&#8217;s new Plus plan. As someone who already uses CleanMyMac regularly, having cloud storage management built into the same workflow makes sense.</p>
