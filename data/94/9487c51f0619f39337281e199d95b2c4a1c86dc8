xAI has <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1912670182012801156">rolled out</a> a new memory feature for Grok, its conversational AI, making the chatbot smarter and more personalized over time. With memory enabled, Grok can now recall past interactions – like your preferences or previous questions – to provide more relevant recommendations and responses.<br/>

According to xAI, this feature brings Grok in line with memory capabilities already found in platforms like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chatgpt-memory-improvements/">ChatGPT</a> and Gemini, where chat history can be revisited and used to enhance future conversations. Users can now rely on Grok to pick up where they left off, improving long-term usability.<br/>
<br/>
The memory feature is currently available in beta on the Grok website and through its iOS and Android apps. However, users in the EU and UK will have to wait, as the feature isn't yet supported in those regions. xAI says it plans to integrate memory into Grok's built-in version on X (formerly Twitter) "soon."<br/>

Just like with other memory-enabled AI tools, users have the ability to <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1912670183472476653">manage what Grok remembers</a>, although telling Grok to "Forget" referenced chats won't delete them from the user's history.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/grok/">Grok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/grok-ai-chatbot-gains-memory-feature/">Grok AI Chatbot Gains Memory Feature for Smarter, Personalized Chats</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/grok-ai-chatbot-gains-memory-feature-for-smarter-personalized-chats.2455509/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
