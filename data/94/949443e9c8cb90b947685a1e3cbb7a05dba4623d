<p>Ina Fried, reporting for Axios:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Jose,
seeks class action status and unspecified financial damages on
behalf of those who purchased Apple Intelligence-capable iPhones
and other devices.</p>

<p>“Apple’s advertisements saturated the internet, television, and
other airwaves to cultivate a clear and reasonable consumer
expectation that these transformative features would be available
upon the iPhone’s release,” the suit reads. “This drove
unprecedented excitement in the market, even for Apple, as the
company knew it would, and as part of Apple’s ongoing effort to
convince consumers to upgrade at a premium price and to
distinguish itself from competitors deemed to be winning the
AI-arms race.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of these class action lawsuits are bullshit, but it’s hard to argue with the basic premise of this one.</p>
