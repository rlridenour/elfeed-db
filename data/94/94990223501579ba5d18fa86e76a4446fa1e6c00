<p>Added this footnote just now to yesterday’s piece on MSNBC’s rebranding to “MS NOW”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Historical pedantry: from 1975–1979, <a href="https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft spelled its name “Micro-Soft”</a>, with, yes, an uppercase <em>S</em>. But that’s not camel-case, and that hyphenated spelling is as much a footnote to Microsoft’s brand history as the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/03/29/how-apples-logo-started-out-as-the-most-expensive-and-became-the-most-iconic">woodcut Isaac-Newton-under-a-tree logo</a> is to Apple. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/08/Microsoft_(1975).svg">Microsoft’s logo from that era</a> was very disco-’70s and kind of cool — but while “Micro” and “Soft” were broken across two lines, there’s no hyphen in the logotype.</p>
