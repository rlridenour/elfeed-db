<li>4 little power banks</li>
<li>Includes USB-C, Lightning, and Micro USB cables with each one</li>
<li>Small enough to fit in your wallet (probably)</li>
<li>Won’t fully recharge your phone, but could be useful</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but they might be able to power the world’s smallest blender for 30 seconds</li>
</ul><h1>Not Much But Some</h1><p>Basically, what we have here are some power banks. No, they don’t pack that much recharging power, but also they don’t take up much space. In fact, they’re small enough to fit in your purse or wallet or what have you.</p>
<p>That means, they’re great…</p>
<p>[Wait for it…]</p>
<p>[Our favorite phrase is incoming in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1…]</p>
<p><em>In a pinch</em>!</p>
<p>As in, you get on the bus heading home after a long day, but traffic is heavy and you forgot to plug your phone in at work, and now you’re in the red with a solid bit of commute left.</p>
<p>One of these won’t fully recharge your phone in a situation like that. But it could keep your phone alive. And that’s something, right?</p>
<p>But here’s the issue. Not with the product, but with this pitch.</p>
<p>Let’s call it the ‘in a pinch’ paradox.</p>
<p>You people who see something like these card-sized power banks and immediately recognize their utility? You’re the most likely to buy them, but you’re the least likely to need them. Because if you understand their value, it shows a high level of self-awareness.</p>
<p>In other words, you realize that your phone could die at an inopportune time, and this understanding drives you to take precautions to protect against that possibility. Such as, in the above example: if you are the type of person who has a charged card-sized power bank in your purse or bag or wallet or whatever, that means you’re also the type of person who would remember to plug in your phone an hour before the end of the workday.</p>
<p>Those, meanwhile, who roll their eyes at something like these power banks and think, <em>Whatever, I don’t need that. I’ll just remember to charge my phone before I’m away from an outlet</em>? Their phones will definitely die at some terrible time. And when they do, they’ll curse themselves for not buying these things.</p>
<p>What we’re getting at is this: if your first thought is that these things are stupid, you should buy them.</p>
<p>And if your first thought is that they’re useful, you should buy them too.</p>
<p>How about everyone buy them, huh? That would be nice, right?</p>
