<p id="p1">2025 is shaping up to be the year of litigation for big tech. Apple&rsquo;s been <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-breach-of-trust-apple-held-in-contempt-over-app-store-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer">held in contempt</a> and has <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/understanding-the-dojs-antitrust-complaint-against-apple/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an antitrust case</a> on the horizon, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/facebook-owner-meta-faces-existential-threat-trial-over-instagram-whatsapp-2025-04-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meta</a> is in the midst of an antitrust trial, and Google is defending <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-seeks-breakup-googles-ad-tech-products-after-judge-finds-illegal-monopoly-2025-05-06/" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/" rel="noopener noreferrer">antitrust</a> lawsuits at once. Every one of these cases is a high-stakes challenge to the status quo, and collectively, they have the potential to reshape the tech industry for years to come.</p>
<p id="p2">The ultimate question for Google right now is whether it will be broken up. What will become of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/650665/google-loses-ad-tech-antitrust-monopoly-lawsuit" rel="noopener noreferrer">ad tech business</a>, and will it be <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-doj-still-wants-google-to-divest-chrome/" rel="noopener noreferrer">forced to sell Chrome</a>? That will be decided by the judges in those cases, but along the way, there are plenty of sideshow dramas worth keeping an eye on. This week, it was Google&rsquo;s turn for a little litigation drama that was prompted not by a judge, but by none other than Apple&rsquo;s SVP of Services Eddy Cue.</p>
<p id="p3">As part of Google&rsquo;s search antitrust case, Cue testified yesterday that in April 2025, Google searches declined in Safari for the very first time. Cue&rsquo;s testimony, which was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/apple-working-to-move-to-ai-search-in-browser-amid-google-fallout" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported on by Mark Gurman, Leah Nylen, and Stephanie Lai of Bloomberg</a>, went on to explain that Apple is investigating AI search as an alternative to traditional search engines, noting that the company has had discussions with Perplexity.</p>
<p id="p4">Google&rsquo;s stock immediately began to fall. By the close of trading, it was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-stock-sinks-on-report-apple-plans-to-integrate-ai-search-into-safari-browser-155545131.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">down around 7.5%</a> and had caused enough concern internally at Google that the company felt compelled to release a one-paragraph <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/statement-press-reports-about-search-traffic/" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement on its blog</a>, The Keyword, responding not to the testimony but to &ldquo;press reports:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  <strong>Here&rsquo;s our statement on this morning&rsquo;s press reports about Search traffic.</strong></p>
<p>  We continue to see overall query growth in Search. That includes an increase in total queries coming from Apple&rsquo;s devices and platforms. More generally, as we enhance Search with new features, people are seeing that Google Search is more useful for more of their queries &mdash;&nbsp;and they&rsquo;re accessing it for new things and in new ways, whether from browsers or the Google app, using their voice or Google Lens. We&rsquo;re excited to continue this innovation and look forward to sharing more at Google I/O.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">It&rsquo;s not news that Google Search is under threat from AI. However, Cue&rsquo;s testimony under oath that Google searches in Safari are in decline is the first concrete evidence publicly shared that the threat is not just theoretical, which is a big deal.</p>
<p id="p7">Apple&rsquo;s exploration of AI-based search is not terribly surprising either, but I do hope they cut <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/apple-partnering-with-startup-anthropic-ai-powered-coding-platform-bloomberg-2025-05-02/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a broader deal with Anthropic</a> instead of Perplexity. I understand why Perplexity&rsquo;s product is popular, but its CEO&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/" rel="noopener noreferrer">contempt for the open web</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/24/perplexity-ceo-says-its-browser-will-track-everything-users-do-online-to-sell-hyper-personalized-ads/" rel="noopener noreferrer">user privacy</a> is something that I&rsquo;d rather not see Apple perpetuate through a partnership.</p>
