<p>Two more things I want to point out in KDE that just work great:</p>
<p>First, Activities. In short, it&rsquo;s a virtual desktop (AKA &ldquo;spaces&rdquo; on macOS) on steroids.
It takes a bit of time to understand how to use these, but once you do, they work great. It allows separate &ldquo;screens&rdquo; with different app shortcuts and desktops, and even saves your sessions. It&rsquo;s kind of like having two different profiles in a web browser, only for your desktop.</p>
<p>I use Activities to separate my work environment from my personal one. The work environment comes with its own desktop wallpaper (it&rsquo;s a good visual queue for me), complete with different pinned apps I need on the panel (Edge vs LibreWolf in the personal environment) and shortcuts on the desktop (the personal environment contains game shortcuts, where the work environment contains recent files I&rsquo;m working on). As a bonus, I can have two separate Emacs windows open, complete with their own files I&rsquo;m working on. I know this is easy to do with frames in Emacs on the Mac, but having Emacs waiting for me in the work environment on the file I left off on, while the personal one points elsewhere, is a nice perk.</p>
<p>The other program I&rsquo;m learning to appreciate quickly is Spectacle. Mac folks won&rsquo;t really care, as the built-in Preview is excellent and does more than what Spectacle does out of the box, but Linux folks like me, who have used Flameshot for a while, you should check it out. Spectacle comes with a few annotation options that cover 95% of whatever I need in Linux, unless I&rsquo;m working on more polished or professional screenshots, which I use Snagit for. I appreciate that, by default, it does not save screenshots, since you often just want to use them for quick copy-paste.</p>
