<p>Finally, after many years of using Emacs for writing, I have assembled what I believe are the key points necessary to take any non-programmer writer gently by the hand into Emacs. This handbook goes ALL THE WAY from &#8220;Why plain text&#8221; to exporting your Org Mode files to crisp, standard manuscript Microsoft Word formatted documents for the writer&#8217;s market.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a technical writer, blogger, copywriter, novelist, or just a weekend short story writer like yours truly, Emacs is the superior composition and editing tool you need to more easily get your ideas out of your head and into the world.</strong></p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://chris-maiorana.kit.com/products/emacs-for-writers">PDF handbook right here</a>.  It&#8217;s a &#8220;pay what you want&#8221;, including FREE, download.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re already an Emacs user, and you have a friend who might benefit from this, be sure to send them the link.  Thanks, everybody.</p>
