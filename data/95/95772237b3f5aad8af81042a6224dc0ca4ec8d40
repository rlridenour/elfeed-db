<p>In the latest development, anti-government protests in Iran have continued into a second week despite a nationwide internet shutdown, with reports of violent clashes and a widening crackdown by security forces. Rights groups and activists have reported a rising death toll, while Iranian authorities have publicly threatened severe punishments for demonstrators, including capital charges. President Trump said the United States is “ready to help” protesters, a stance Iranian leaders reject as interference, warning they would retaliate against U.S. forces in the region and Israel if America attacks Iran. The situation has heightened regional tension, even as many Iranians continue to show resilience and solidarity by returning to the streets and sharing evidence when they can despite communications restrictions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/xFRbVJep0DXsfn30r495OVhsz7umvPK82nwI2hRbLuop6XW-VRXwgMfgwWt8HQcR0Vac1jyJ5MXIOsblP43nS4xRGbq-6FdUQlZkwpFP7xz7YtxCiP20UWzlQT78VwT6aEHycTZ3u78ROWxFm1AIwPjE47nGpvv_DhjVQp8YX35LlvGG-jaApjn_BQa42AQ' alt='Street protests in Iran amid an ongoing internet blackout.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Hospitals overwhelmed: Doctors and medics described emergency rooms struggling with large numbers of dead and critically injured protesters, with some accounts alleging the use of live ammunition and severe head wounds.</li><li>Retaliation warning: Iran’s parliament speaker said U.S. bases, ships and Israel would be “legitimate targets” if the United States strikes Iran, as lawmakers held a session focused on the unrest.</li><li>Israel alert level: Israeli sources told reporters Israel has moved to a “high alert” posture amid speculation about possible U.S. intervention linked to the protests.</li><li>Economic trigger: Several outlets reported the unrest began with anger over soaring inflation and a sharp fall in Iran’s currency, before shifting toward broader political demands in multiple cities.</li><li>Crackdown framing: Iranian officials and state-linked messaging have described parts of the unrest as terrorism or sabotage and accused the United States and Israel of stoking it, a claim Western reporting notes Tehran has not substantiated publicly.</li></ul><blockquote>Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before.
