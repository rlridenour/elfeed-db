Apple's first foldable iPhone will be equipped with four cameras, and Touch ID instead of Face ID, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-24/apple-to-launch-iphone-17-pro-iphone-17-air-in-september-iphone-fold-next-year-mepmzpcj"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, Gurman said the four cameras will consist of one front camera, one inner camera, and two rear cameras.<br/>
<br/>
The latest iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad models have Touch ID power buttons, and this feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/25/touch-id-returns-iphone-not-how-you-think/">will likely extend to the foldable iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The foldable iPhone will use Apple's second-generation C2 modem for cellular connectivity, but it will lack a physical SIM card slot, said Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is currently testing black and white color options for the foldable iPhone, he added.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman expects the foldable iPhone to have a book-like design, with a large inner display when unfolded. Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously said the foldable iPhone will have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">5.5-inch outer display, and a 7.8-inch inner display</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">Galaxy Z Fold7</a> has an 8-inch inner screen, and a 6.5-inch outer screen.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the foldable iPhone — and Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold8, will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/foldable-iphone-galaxy-z-fold-8-crease-free/">"crease-free" inner display</a>. He said Apple will achieve this feat by using a laser-drilled metal display plate, which can disperse the stress generated by bending.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said Apple recently pivoted from on-cell to in-cell display technology, and he believes this change should help to make the foldable iPhone's crease "less obvious."<br/>
<br/>
He said Apple plans to release the foldable iPhone next year — as widely expected.<br/>
