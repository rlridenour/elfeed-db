If you&rsquo;re a Flycheck or Flymake user and like eye candy, you might enjoy this new package from Mikael Konradsson. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1ltp2j0/announcing_flyover_modern_aesthetic_overlay_for/">a nice looking overlay for Flymake and Flycheck</a>. There&rsquo;s a couple of screen shots at the link that show what it looks like.

There&rsquo;s a lot more information at the project&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/konrad1977/flyover">GitHub repository</a>. There are more screenshots and a more comprehensive explanation of what it does and how it works. As I said, there&rsquo;s a lot of information at GitHub so you should definitely take a look at that if your interested but here&rsquo;s a list of it&rsquo;s features taken from the repository:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Nice looking, customizable overlays for error display that are theme aware</li>
<li>Errors, Warnings, and Info messages are distinguished by different styles</li>
<li>Realtime updates while editing</li>
<li>Smart position and formatting of messages</li>
<li>Efficient overlay management</li>
<li>Markdown-style syntax highlighting in messages</li>
</ol>
<p>
The package is available from Melpa so it&rsquo;s easy to install if you&rsquo;d like to try it.</p>
