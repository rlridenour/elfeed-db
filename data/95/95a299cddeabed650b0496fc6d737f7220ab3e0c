Digital IDs are also able to be added to the Wallet app in Puerto Rico.<br/>
<h2>States Planning to Add Support</h2><br/>
Several states have announced plans to support digital IDs in the Wallet app in the future.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connecticut</li><br/>
 	<li>Kentucky</li><br/>
 	<li>Mississippi</li><br/>
 	<li>Oklahoma</li><br/>
 	<li>Utah</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
There's no word on when these states plan to add support, nor on other states that have not yet committed to introducing the functionality.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Passport Digital IDs</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/12/apple-launches-digital-id-passport-feature/">As of November 2025</a>, Apple is allowing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to create a Digital ID in the Wallet app using a U.S. passport. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch users who do not live in a state that supports digital IDs and driver's licenses can instead use their passport to create an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; ID.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Digital IDs created using a passport work the same way as state IDs and driver's licenses added to the Wallet app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>TSA Support</h2><br/>
TSA security checkpoints at most major airports in the United States accept digital IDs in lieu of a physical ID. Digital IDs in the Wallet app can only be used for domestic travel.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Age Verification</h2><br/>
State IDs stored in the Wallet app can be used for age verification purposes at businesses and retailers that support the functionality. Apple is also adding support for using IDs for age verification in apps and on websites.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Physical ID Requirements</h2><br/>
Most states say that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users are still required to present a physical ID if requested, and a digital ID cannot be used in lieu of an actual ID.<br/>
<br/>
Digital IDs based on a passport cannot be used for international travel or border crossing purposes, so a physical passport is still required.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Add an ID</h2><br/>
An eligible driver's license, ID, or passport can be added to the Wallet app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by tapping on the "+" sign in the upper right corner and then choosing the "Driver's License and ID Cards" option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Device Compatibility</h2><br/>
Using the digital ID feature in the Wallet app requires an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 or later with iOS 16.5 or later or an Apple Watch Series 4 or later running watchOS 9.5 or later.<br/>
<br/>
Adding a passport requires an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 or later running iOS 26.1 or later or an Apple Watch Series 6 running watchOS 26.1 or later.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/19/wallet-app-drivers-licenses-all-states/">Here Are All the States That Support Digital Driver&#039;s Licenses in the iPhone Wallet App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-the-states-that-support-digital-drivers-licenses-in-the-iphone-wallet-app.2471537/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
