<p>I appreciate what Adobe is doing with <a href="https://research.adobe.com/articles/indigo/indigo.html">Project Indigo</a>. It’s a free iOS camera app, but it is heavily disclaimed as being experimental with unique features you can’t find in other apps. But Adobe also says they’re targeting “casual” photographers, which seems misguided.</p>
<p>A few people I know have even been <a href="https://duck.haus/@powerllama/114911580348179333">evangelizing Project Indigo</a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sageolson/114911639398600819">because they</a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@czeins/114808161918632764">love</a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@czeins/114813948073036836">it</a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@czeins/114842237686416477">so much</a>, especially when they compare it to photos from Apple’s Camera app. My enthusiasm for this product doesn’t match their own. It’s <em>neat</em> but it’s not <em>great</em>.</p>
<p>It isn’t all-purpose (it can only take still photos), and it can’t do panoramas or portrait mode. It doesn’t have the compressed storage of the editable HEIC files Apple introduced with the iPhone 16 Pro, or the new photographic styles pipeline that lets a user control tone mapping and certain processing, both before the photo is taken and after the fact.</p>
<p>There are still a few noteworthy tricks it pulls off that are worth a look.</p>

<h2>Watch your tone</h2>
<p>One of the <em>highlights</em> (wink) of Project Indigo is its tone mapping. The Camera app, and nearly all other camera apps, combine multiple photos taken at different exposures into one image to produce a single image with a wide amount of dynamic range from the brightest brights to the darkest darks. Project Indigo combines “up to 32” images to produce its result. They’re producing an image that is a RAW DNG file and a JPEG.</p>

Left: Project Indigo taking a photo after the sun has set at blue hour. The only bright sources of light are artificial ones. The image is soft even though nothing is moving. Right: The Camera app has gone overboard filling the shadows, and it looks like a photo on a bright, overcast day. The flower is sharp, but there are ringing edges around out-of-focus highlights.<br>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can’t adjust the tone mapping like you can with Photographic Styles. You’re supposed to take it into Lightroom and treat it like the RAW output of a DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p>
<p>The default result tends to be much more naturalistic than the Camera app.</p>

Left: Project Indigo holds on to more shadow detail in this high-contrast lighting. Right: The Camera app didn’t capture the same amount of detail on the shadow side.<br>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In some cases, you can approximate what Project Indigo is doing with the tone control in Photographic Styles on an iPhone 16 Pro. However, both Project Indigo and the Camera app have semantic masking to alter different parts of an image to different degrees. You might lift the shadows in one area and flatten out all the midtones, or push things too far into brightness. It’s not one-to-one.</p>

Left: The same tone mapping from Project Indigo. Right: The Photographic Style has been changed to more closely match the Project Indigo version, but some areas are brighter.<br>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>One immediate drawback to all the exposures Project Indigo is taking is that it takes a while to process the photo when the shutter button is pressed. The app doesn’t lock up, but you need to keep the app open until the circular progress indicator finishes.<sup id="fnref-36386-loss"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-36386-loss" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It’s not like it takes <em>minutes</em>, but it isn’t anywhere near as fast as the Camera app, which we all take for granted. Sometimes you want to take a photo and immediately check it to see if you got what you were aiming for, and you don’t get that kind of turnaround. Obviously, it’s doing a lot of work in a tiny span of time, but it makes the app feel sluggish. This can be a particular pain for photographing a transient moment in time, like wildlife, children, vehicles, sports, etc.</p>
<p>While in “Photo” capture mode, the app is constantly capturing data before you push the shutter button, but when you switch to “Night,” it tries to use longer exposure times if the phone is relatively stable, and thus the process and processing are slower still.</p>
<p>All that processing does look “more natural” when you look at the resulting images from far enough away, but up close, you’ll always see some degree of softness.</p>
<figure>
<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fence_detail%402x.jpg?ssl=1" onmouseover="this.src='https://sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fence_detail_loupe@2x.jpg'" onmouseout="this.src='https://sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fence_detail.jpg'" alt="A side by side comparison of two photos. The subject matter is a basketball court with a reddish-pink, chain-link fence and a pond with grasses by the shoreline. The fence reflects into the pond, and also layers over itself." data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image"><figcaption>
Left: Project Indigo mushes all the fence detail, especially in the reflection, where the gentle ripples in the water cause big shifts in softness, likely from the water surface moving between the exposures. Right: The iPhone captures a sharper, clearer version of the fence, but the links in the fence start to get a little chewed up by the Camera app’s sharpening filter that users can’t control.<br>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are occasionally artifacts like doubled edges or fine patterns that can just turn into mush. When you combine these exposures, you reduce things like noise —but unless you have your iPhone on a tripod, and the subject matter is perfectly still, pixels are going to be blended not just in time, but spatially.</p>
<figure>
<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/palms_crop.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="A side-by-side comparison of two photos. The subjects are some palm tree fronds shot from underneath with a blue sky and wispy clouds." data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image"><figcaption>
Left: Crop of the 5x capture in Project Indigo, where the wind is moving the fronds enough that there are 2-4 times the number of frond tips there should be. Also smears the green and magenta chromatic aberration into blobs as the highlights move back and forth. Right: The same crop of the Camera app’s 5x capture.<br>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>I can’t speak to the <em>details</em> of the Camera app’s multiple exposure combination, but it’s not as prone to ghosting a bunch of overlapping detail like Project Indigo. Some of that might be that it’s combining fewer exposures, or it’s how Apple has tuned the image processing to isolate regions with movement. Adobe also does semantic processing to mask things when it’s combining images, but whatever it’s doing, it’s always soft and fringy.</p>
<p>Project Indigo seems to be allergic to having any noise, so I’m baffled about why there’s an AI Denoise feature included in the app. What would you remove noise from?</p>
<h2>Super resolution</h2>
<p>When you try to capture a photo at a resolution other than the native ones, Project Indigo tags them as Super Resolution, or SR. On my iPhone 16 Pro, that’s 2x and 10x. There’s no way to turn off this processing and tell the app that you’d rather have the noise.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/palm_10x.jpg?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/palm_10x.jpg?ssl=1" alt="A photo of the top of a palm tree illuminated by afternoon sun with a blue sky behind it." data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image"></a><figcaption>

Left: The same soft Project Indigo 10x version with doubled details. Right: The Camera app’s 5x capture cropped in to match. It has heavier denoising and then sharpening, which makes it look very processed, but clear.<br>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a classic “six colors of one, half-dozen colors of the other” situation. What’s the advantage of Super Resolution when the output is this blurry? Detail doesn’t <em>resolve</em>, which is what the word <em>resolution</em> is for.</p>
<h2>Clumsy controls</h2>
<figure class="pull-right"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/duck-up-6c.png?ssl=1" alt="Screenshot of a camera app showing a duck on lily pads. Settings include ISO 32, 1/1600s shutter speed, and exposure +0.0. Zoom options: 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x. Icons for flash, timer, and settings at the bottom." data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image"><figcaption>Indigo’s interface is complex and nested. Other third-party apps do this better.</figcaption></figure>
<p>iOS 26’s big innovation for photography is to hide many of the controls in the Camera app. Project Indigo has a lot of manual controls you can <em>get to</em> but they are not at your fingertips. Instead, it relies on the submenus found by tapping icons that show at the top and bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>The file format is self-explanatory, and the camera icon is just a pop-over menu to access the same “Photo” and “Night” mode toggles at the bottom of the interface. If you tap on the histogram, you can choose between a histogram display format with the ISO and shutter or one without, but if you <em>swipe</em> the histogram, you get all the display overlays like levels, grids, and <em>the app’s settings</em>.</p>
<p>The thing that looks like a settings icon (two sliders in a circle) in the bottom right of the interface is the “Pro Mode” set of controls to adjust focus, ISO, aperture, exposure compensation, white balance, and —if you’re in Night mode— the number of frames to merge. I would argue that these are common enough tools that they should be pinnable to the main view.</p>
<p>They can each be set independently to a manual setting or to auto, but you need to tap each one individually, and then slide the horizontal slider.<sup id="fnref-36386-sliders"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-36386-sliders" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">2</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Camera app, you can do exposure compensation by tapping in the photo viewing area and dragging up or down near that point on a vertical slider overlay. There’s no quick access mechanism like that in Project Indigo.</p>
<p>As far as manual controls go, there are better apps for this. Third-party apps like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/obscura-pro-camera/id1579306989">Obscura</a>, <a href="https://halide.cam/">Halide</a>,  etc., provide more intuitive arrangements of controls or gestural elements. Project Indigo is much more like the complex, nested interface of the pre-iOS 26 Camera app —just differently complex, and differently nested.</p>
<h2>Reflecting on removal</h2>
<p>Reflection removal is the show-stopping feature that made me rush to download the app when it first launched. I often use a <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/why-and-how-to-use-a-circular-polarizer-filter">circular polarizer</a> on my DSLR and mirrorless camera. Those filters can reduce reflections and glare, and improve contrast. There are companies that will sell you circular polarizer attachments for smartphones, but they are clunky. To be able to get a similar function from software would be handy.</p>
<p>Adobe <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/12/12/removing-window-reflections-adobe-camera-raw">announced reflection removal first for Adobe Camera RAW</a>, but you needed to use the Bridge app on a desktop computer and the files had to be a certain way, blah blah blah. Project Indigo made it a one-stop shop where any photo you took with Project Indigo was available.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in reality, reflection removal is not like using a circular polarizer. It spits out three images: The original, the image with the reflection removed, and what it thinks the reflection was. Reflections are additive light, so Adobe trained a model to figure out how to recognize patterns and subtract them. It’s very clever, but it is remarkably easy to make it all fall apart.</p>
<figure>
<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pond_refl.jpeg?ssl=1" alt="" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image"><figcaption>
Left: Original test image of a reflecting pool with lily pads and a concrete structure under the water. Center: The reflection removal result, which subtracted most of what was under the water, not the reflected light of the sky. Right: What the software guesses was a reflection, which was really under the water.<br>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Almost all the test images I have taken over the past three months and run through Remove Reflections have had notable artifacts. In several cases it gets confused by what is a reflection and what is refracted through a surface — like a completely still pond where it eliminates things in the water, or a set of multiple glass surfaces.</p>
<figure>
<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tv_refl.jpeg?ssl=1" alt=". The subject matter" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" class=" jetpack-broken-image"><figcaption>
Left: Original test image of a TV reflecting lamp with a white wall. Center: The reflection removal result with chunks of the wall missing, and the reflection only dimmed. Right: What the software guesses is the reflection.<br>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s no way to dial back detail, or get the model to guess again (like you can do with content-aware fill/removal). You’d need to take your image results into some other kind of image compositing app to bring some amount of the reflection back. If you had a circular polarizer, you’d just turn it before you took the photo to remove less, but obviously, it can’t work like that.</p>
<figure>

Left: Original test image of a pastry case with a glass front and a few reflections. Center: The minimal reflections are mostly removed correctly. Right: A wildly detailed reflection image.<br>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>This really feels like a research project more than any other part of Project Indigo, but it’s also the boldest thing that this computational photography app can do. I would like to see another iteration of this, with better semantic masking to ignore frames, walls, and underwater elements.</p>
<p>Maybe they can save motion vectors from the camera movement to calculate perspective shifts, or use the depth sensors to figure out surface vs. see-through for segmentation. I don’t know, I’m just an idea guy.</p>
<h2>Let’s see where this Indi-goes</h2>
<p>Since Project Indigo isn’t as all-purpose, responsive, or crisp as the default Camera app or the other third-party camera apps, it’ll remain an experimental curiosity—one that’s worth checking in on only occasionally. I don’t want to open an app and only then remember it can’t take a video, and that photos of text will be a fuzzy mess.</p>
<p>It seems like it would be a better idea to build a fully featured camera app that happens to include experimental features, rather than an app that only has experimental features. It’s great to develop ideas out in the open, but if it’s convenient to use, then more people will spend time using the app. I also worry that Project Indigo might be another novel testbed that just fizzles out and doesn’t produce any follow-on product. Adobe’s graveyard of dead iOS apps is massive.</p>
<p>Conversely, it would be nice to see other developers get inspired by some of the problems Adobe is trying to tackle with Project Indigo. I would hope that the people working on Apple’s Camera app feel emboldened to tweak their tone mapping and think about how they can approach reflection removal. There’s plenty to do in the world of computational photography that isn’t just about hiding controls.</p>
