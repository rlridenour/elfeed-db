Though in 2023 the university administration assured Finlay he would keep his job, it went back on that commitment and <a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/07/04/dont-accept-an-offer-from-australian-catholic-university/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let him go in 2024</a>. Prior to his time at Dianoia he was at the University of Southern California.</p>
