<p id="p1">Less than two weeks ago, Apple announced that it was <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/apple-delays-siri-personalization/" rel="noopener noreferrer">delaying the launch of a more personalized Siri</a>. Today, Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg, says the company is shuffling leadership of the project, too. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/apple-vision-pro-chief-mike-rockwell-named-siri-head-giannandrea-keeps-ai-role" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Gurman</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has lost confidence in the ability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product development, so he&rsquo;s moving over another top executive to help: Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. In a new role, Rockwell will be in charge of the Siri virtual assistant, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the moves haven&rsquo;t been announced.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p3">Giannandrea isn&rsquo;t leaving Apple. Instead, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/apple-vision-pro-chief-mike-rockwell-named-siri-head-giannandrea-keeps-ai-role" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gurman says</a> Giannandrea will continue to oversee &ldquo;research, testing and technologies related to AI&rdquo; including a team investigating robotics. Rockwell, who led the development of the Vision Pro, will report to Craig Federighi, Apple&rsquo;s senior vice president of software.</p>
<p id="p4">Rockwell has had a long and successful track record at Apple, so hopefully Siri is in good hands going forward. It&rsquo;s clear that there&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done, but the promise of a more personalized Siri and a system for apps to communicate with each other via Apple Intelligence is something I&rsquo;m glad the company isn&rsquo;t giving up on. Hopefully, we&rsquo;ll see some progress from Rockwell&rsquo;s team soon.</p>
