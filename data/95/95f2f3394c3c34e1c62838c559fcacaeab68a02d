<blockquote>
  <p>As of today, Sony already relies on different manufacturing
partners to create its TV lineup. While display panel
manufacturers never reveal who they sell panels to, Sony is likely
already using panels for its LCD TVs from TCL China Star
Optoelectronics Technology (CSOT), in addition to OLED panels from
LG Display and Samsung Display. With this deal, a relationship
between Sony and TCL CSOT LCD panels is guaranteed (although I
doubt this would affect CSOT selling panels to other
manufacturers). And with <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1761118790">TCL CSOT building a new OLED
facility</a>, there’s a potential future in which Sony OLEDs
will also get panels from TCL. Although I should point out that
we’re not sure yet if the new facility will have the ability to
make TV-sized OLED panels, at least to start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gist I take from this is that Sony is already dependent upon TCL. I think the mistake Sony made was ever ceding ownership and control over their display technology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s some concern from fans that this could lead to a Sharp,
Toshiba, or Pioneer situation where the names are licensed and the
TVs produced are a shell of what the brands used to represent. I
don’t see this happening with Sony. While the electronics side of
the business hasn’t been as strong as in the past, Sony — and
Bravia — is still a storied brand. It would take a lot for Sony
to completely step aside and allow another company to slap its
name on an inferior product. And based on TCL’s growth and
technological improvements over the past few years, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/857325/the-gap-between-premium-and-budget-tv-brands-is-quickly-closing">the
shrinking gap between premium and midrange TVs</a>, I don’t
expect Sony TVs will suffer from a partnership with TCL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m heartened by Higgins’s optimism. (And I’ve heard good things <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/21/sony-tcl-tvs">already</a> from DF readers who own TCL TVs.)</p>
