<p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance visited Armenia and signed an agreement to move forward on cooperation in civil nuclear energy, a step officials and coverage described as deepening U.S.-Armenian ties and expanding work in the sector. The trip came as Washington tries to shore up a U.S.-brokered Armenia-Azerbaijan peace process tied to the long-running Nagorno-Karabakh dispute. From Yerevan, Vance traveled to Azerbaijan as part of a regional swing meant to reinforce the peace process and build momentum for a new transit and trade corridor the U.S. supports. Alongside the nuclear track, Vance also pointed to possible U.S. exports and investment interest in Armenia, while some opposition-linked voices in Azerbaijan urged Washington to pair economic engagement with attention to political-rights concerns.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/aGbBDjdwXhqiIou8KNGKzSEl-5WaZwjjlDBsWUugVcLaO-hdvbPRQxaLRLNmsmaUVpTEB4aDwgFCxzxSMXLBCFfmG5-0tX0drrqnXoYO5Om53ycVcsVeJMb287-jBnJxwYODbtX_3kOmLuM1IyQUg_z4GB2jdstlJBjh34_yMVmu3P-gvVA3t4g-5zfH--u6zr9p4lYxViUUM4DVKHOWXhyy6A' alt='U.S. Vice President JD Vance during his visit to Armenia as talks advance on civil nuclear cooperation and regional trade links.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Section 123 terms: Reuters reported the nuclear framework uses a so-called Section 123 Agreement structure, the U.S. legal basis for civil nuclear cooperation and export terms.</li><li>Investment scale: Vance discussed up to $9 billion in potential investment and exports tied to Armenia’s nuclear-energy plans, according to Al Jazeera and Reuters.</li><li>Arms-tech offer: In Armenia, Vance said the U.S. is ready to export advanced computer chips and surveillance drones and invest in infrastructure.</li><li>Trade corridor push: RFE/RL described U.S. efforts to promote a strategic transit corridor through the region as central to shifting trade, energy flows, and influence in the South Caucasus.</li><li>Corridor branding: Euronews reported the proposed trade corridor is being promoted under the name TRIPP.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Armenian government: Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan met Vance and signed an agreement to advance negotiations on a civil nuclear energy deal, framing the visit as a step toward deeper cooperation.
