The fourth season of the show will open in spring 2024, and it will explore topics like the rise of misinformation, according to Apple:<blockquote>With the UBA-NBN merger complete, the newsroom must grapple with newfound responsibility, hidden motives and the elusive nature of truth in a polarized America. In a world rife with deepfakes, conspiracy theories and corporate cover-ups — who can you trust?</blockquote>The award-winning drama series stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, who also serve as executive producers. The star-studded ensemble cast has also included the likes of Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, and Jon Hamm. <br/>
