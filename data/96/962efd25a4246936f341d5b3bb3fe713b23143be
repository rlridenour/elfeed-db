<p id="p2">It&rsquo;s been over a year and a half since the debut of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1672356376" rel="noopener noreferrer">Callsheet</a>, the app from <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey Liss</a> for looking up information about films and TV shows, and the app has grown a lot in that time. From new app icon variations to more fine-grained spoiler settings to actors&rsquo; heights and ages, Callsheet has gained many new capabilities. My favorite addition thus far is the indicator for mid- and post-credit scenes in movies.</p>
<p id="p3">The app&rsquo;s latest update expands greatly upon a feature that&rsquo;s been present since the beginning: pinned items. Users can now create multiple separate lists of pinned items and organize them to their hearts&rsquo; content. As someone who watches quite a bit of TV and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/magic-rays-of-light/" rel="noopener noreferrer">covers it regularly</a>, I could certainly benefit from this feature, so I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p id="p4"><!--more--></p>
<p id="p5">I&rsquo;ve never felt like I was using Callsheet&rsquo;s Pinned Items list to its fullest potential. For the most part, I&rsquo;ve used it to quickly access shows that I&rsquo;m currently watching so that I don&rsquo;t have to search for them over and over when I want to look up information about them. But I&rsquo;ve also wished for it to be a place to store upcoming titles I want to keep an eye on, movies I plan to share as Up Next picks on Magic Rays of Light, and more. Together in one list, that many items can become overwhelming and difficult to navigate, so I&rsquo;ve had to keep my list pretty limited.</p>
<p id="p6">With the ability to create multiple lists, that&rsquo;s no longer a problem. I can create a list for each of these different use cases to keep titles separate and list sizes manageable. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I did.</p>
<p id="p7">By default, Callsheet presents a single list of Pinned Items at the top of the Discover page. To the right of the Pinned Items heading resides a new button labeled &lsquo;Add list&hellip;&rsquo; When I tapped that button, I was presented with a sheet where I could enter the name of my new list and create it by tapping the &lsquo;Add&rsquo; button. Suddenly, my number of pinned lists doubled from one to two &ndash; and that was just the beginning.</p>
<p id="p8">The first list I created was called &lsquo;Podcast Rewatches.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a sucker for TV rewatch podcasts, and there are several shows I watch every week so that I can then listen to cast and crew members discussing them. Are these people profiting off of my nostalgia? They sure are. Am I still happy to listen along? You bet I am.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://cdn.macstories.net/wednesday-19-mar-2025-00-19-34-1742361587715.png" alt="Creating a new list (left), moving an item between lists (middle), and copying an item to another list (right)."><p class="image-caption">Creating a new list (left), moving an item between lists (middle), and copying an item to another list (right).</p></div>
<p id="p10">After creating my list, I wanted to move those shows from my default Pinned Items list to my new Podcast Rewatches list. Doing so was as simple as opening my Pinned Items list, long-pressing on a title, choosing &lsquo;Move&rsquo;, and selecting the list I wanted to move the item to.</p>
<p id="p11">I then decided to create a few more lists: one for my all-time favorites, one for series currently airing on Apple TV+, one for titles I want to watch in the future, and one for recommendations I plan to share on my podcast. By the time I had finished organizing titles into these various silos, my original, cluttered Pinned Items list was nearly empty.</p>
<p id="p12">There were some titles, though, that I wanted to include in more than one list at a time. For example, Boy Meets World belongs both in my Podcast Rewatches list and my All-Time Favorites list (at the top, of course). Callsheet makes this easy with its &lsquo;Copy&rsquo; option. Rather than moving an item from one list to another, I can copy it over, preserving its spot in the original list while adding it to the new one.</p>
<p id="p13">Getting my lists set up and organized was a breeze, and it was quite satisfying, too. The &lsquo;Add list&hellip;&rdquo; button in the upper-right corner of the Discover page became the &lsquo;Switch list&rsquo; button once I had more than one list, allowing me to quickly toggle between them as needed.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img src="https://cdn.macstories.net/wednesday-19-mar-2025-00-06-32-1742360806987.png" alt="You can add an item to any of your pinned lists by long-pressing the pin icon."><p class="image-caption">You can add an item to any of your pinned lists by long-pressing the pin icon.</p></div>
<p id="p15">Adding a new show, movie, or person to a list is as simple as navigating to its listing in the app and tapping the pin icon in the upper-right corner. By default, the title will be added to whichever list is currently active, but if I press and hold the button, I can open a menu of all my lists and add the title to whichever one &ndash; or ones &ndash; I like. If I&rsquo;m viewing an item that&rsquo;s already in my pinned list, the icon will be filled. And in a really nice touch, Callsheet will even indicate if a title is included in a list <em>other</em> than the current one by filling the pin icon with a pinstripe.</p>
<p id="p16">Pinned items and lists sync across devices via iCloud, so I can view and edit lists on my iPhone, iPad, Apple silicon Mac, or even my Vision Pro. The app&rsquo;s bottom-justified search bar looks particularly good as a spatial computing ornament.</p>
<p id="p17">Callsheet&rsquo;s implementation of multiple pinned lists is really well done. It makes it quick and easy to organize items into smaller lists, whether you want to just create a couple or get really detailed. And if you&rsquo;re happy with a single, simple list of pinned items, the feature stays out of the way. It&rsquo;s clear that the pinned list system, like the app as a whole, has been deeply considered and carefully crafted to fit the needs of a wide array of users. The feature is yet another reason that Callsheet is, in my opinion, a must-have for TV and film fans.</p>

<p id="p19">The app&rsquo;s most recent update includes a handful of other useful features as well:</p>
<ul id="ul20"><li>Every pinned list features a dice button that will present you with a randomly selected title when pressed, in case you&rsquo;re stuck on what to watch.</li>
<li>Many of the app&rsquo;s built-in icons now have dark mode variants.</li>
<li>The app now features three controls and Shortcuts actions for starting a search, repeating your most recent search, and opening the currently active pinned list.</li>
</ul><p id="p21">Callsheet is available to download for free <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1672356376" rel="noopener noreferrer">from the App Store</a>. After the first 20 searches, a $1/month or $9/year subscription is required to continue using the app, and each subscription comes with a one-week free trial.</p>
