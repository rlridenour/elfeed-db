<p>Has the literature review in philosophy dissertations largely disappeared, and if so, what should we think of this change?<span id="more-56296"></span></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://digressionsimpressions.substack.com/p/on-the-futility-of-the-scholarly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> reflecting on how younger scholars have engaged (or not) with his work, <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/c/e.s.schliesser/e.s.schliesser.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Schliesser</a> (Amsterdam) expresses his sense of futility about his inclusion in that &#8220;a fragile chain of collective learning&#8221; from past to future. Despite being widely cited, &#8220;[N]early all my papers seemed to have been incredibly elusive pebbles in a vast ocean of learning,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not just him (it&#8217;s not), then we might be curious about what contributed to this state of affairs. Schliesser offers one possible contributing factor:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The near disappearance of the literature review in the PhD stage has removed the nudge to read deeply into the literature. </em></p>
<p>There are probably other factors as well. One is simply the <em>growth</em> of the literature. Most people&#8217;s complaint is that they are <em>not cited at all</em>, not that they&#8217;re <em>not cited in sufficiently informative ways</em>. The vastness of the literature can help explain both: there&#8217;s no time to read most of everything to cite it, let alone time to read it so that one can argue with it in print.</p>
<p>Still, in smaller, slower-moving subfields, the growth of the literature will not be as much of an explanatory factor, and the lit review explanation may carry more weight.</p>
<p>Schliesser thinks there are reasons to be concerned about the &#8220;near disappearance&#8221; of lit reviews:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I think this also means that the fate of the engagement with each work is not the product of the sober, dispersed judgment of many separate scholars, but rather it is funneled through a small number of proxy-metrics, relative perceived status in the field, and the concentrated power of a few influential supervisors.</em></p>
<p>So there are some questions here.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the current state of the literature review in the PhD stage in philosophy programs? Has your department made relatively recent policy changes about this, or have there been non-formalized changes over time?</li>
<li>What explains the decline of the literature review in philosophy?</li>
<li>What are the costs and benefits of the decline of the literature review?</li>
<li>What role has been / will be played by technology like AI in regard to lit reviews?</li>
<li>Is there a workable version of the literature review that should be revived? Should something replace it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Discussion welcome.</p>
