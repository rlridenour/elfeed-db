I&rsquo;ve been fascinated with the Zettelkasten idea ever  since i read Sönke Ahrens’ book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Technique-ebook/dp/B09V5M8FR5/ref=sr_1_3?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oOTwvkINVmy0v2O65ttxLR-mO-19xmZAhZINedeGJIaUrakh8glX0b9nyEN1GJjsc90Lsn8l_dPWLvzHfK6t4bhZXXr7ALq13NathKvhwNiHzHLRMiiSCkGbJmsW1c83J2_0PvWRIQR0qiZbjRXzIaqL2cVFC_CPtiRlRjn6Xsc86pKk7FggiI8w7DOYT_3qqozrLO8wHqZAWF4nE-MacXQB2eFWhG6PwBjperAb5zBemIcZPlpTRSBEavvb36O6-TFyY2TCd2fod7oJNAtAmCoNs84KDlmyMUMXAq0Xy2Q.9qJqPiv62hIwJkGlt7NtKRFmhL44uR4q1LM8HqI13zc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=zettelkasten&amp;qid=1754178282&amp;sr=8-3#">How To Take Smart Notes</a>. I just came across a new project by Yibie called <a href="https://github.com/yibie/org-workbench">org-workbench</a> that marries the idea of a Zettelkasten card to all or parts of one or more Org files.
</p>
<p>
The idea is that each heading and its content is imported to a single card. Subheadings are numbered in the way that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann#Note-taking_system_(Zettelkasten)">Niklas Luhmann</a> used for his famous Zettelkasten. The cards themselves are independent of the original Org files so the cards can be manipulated without affecting the source files, although there is a facility to sync them.
</p>
<p>
On the workbench, all the cards are at the same level so it&rsquo;s easy to move them up and down. That means, for example, that you can move a card from one subtree to another, something that&rsquo;s not easy—without cutting and pasting—with the Org file itself.
</p>
<p>
The description isn&rsquo;t clear on the exact way the package functions and I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to try it out so I can&rsquo;t be too specific on how it works but it seems like a nice package for anyone who likes the Zettelkasten method. Take a look at the README for more details if you&rsquo;re interested.
