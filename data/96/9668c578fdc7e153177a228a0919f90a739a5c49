Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 updates to public beta testers, with the betas coming just a few days after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/16/apple-seeds-ios-18-6-beta-1/">provided the betas to developers</a>.<br/>

Testers who have signed up for beta updates through Apple's beta site can download iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6 from the Settings app on a compatible device by going to General > Software Update.<br/>

When the developer betas came out earlier this week, we didn't find any notable new features. Apple initially planned to release <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> in China in the iOS 18.6 beta, but that plan may have been delayed due to ongoing regulatory issues.<br/>
<br/>
We don't know what's in iOS 18.6 and iPadOS 18.6, but the updates seem to focus on smaller changes and bug fixes.<br/>

Apple is also beta testing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a>, and while betas are limited to developers right now, a public beta will be coming in July.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/18/apple-releases-ios-18-6-public-beta/">Apple Releases iOS 18.6 Public Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-ios-18-6-public-beta.2459255/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
