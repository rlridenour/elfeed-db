<p>Now see this: Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-vision-pro-upgraded-with-the-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band/">today announced the first major revamp to the Vision Pro</a>, bringing its brand new M5 processor to the device, along with a new band.</p>
<p>While the overall design of the device doesn’t change, the new M5, built on a 3nm process, brings better performance to the headset. According to Apple, the M5 can render 10 percent more pixels on the Vision Pro’s OLED displays, improving the sharpness of text; the new processor also supports a 120Hz refresh rate when viewing their physical surroundings, reducing motion blur, which should help make the pass-through mode more seamless.</p>
<p>Apple also cites improved battery life with this new version, sporting up to two and a half hours of general usage on a charge (up from two hours for the M2-powered version) and three hours of video playback (up from two and a half hours for the M2 version). Those savings appear to be related to the processor itself, since the Apple cites the different times for the models in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW283LL/A/apple-vision-pro-battery">Apple Vision Pro Battery</a> listing.</p>
<p>The new Dual Knit Band, included with the M5-powered Vision Pro, looks like a mix between the original Vision Pro’s two straps, the Solo Knit Band and the Dual Loop Band. It has the style of the Knit Band, boasting the 3D-knitted fabric on both lower and upper bands. The lower band also includes embedded tungsten inserts, designed to provide a counterweight to the Vision Pro’s own weight. Apple says this will provide better comfort and balance. It’ll be available in small, medium, and large sizes and is compatible with the M2 Vision Pro; it’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/DUAL_KNIT_BAND_SA/apple-vision-pro-dual-knit-band">up for purchase on its own</a> for $99.</p>
<p>There’s also some additional clarity around two previously announced Vision Pro accessories. The Logitech Muse, a 3D-enabled digital pencil device, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HS9U2">is now available for preorder</a> from both Logitech and Apple for $129.95.</p>
<p>Apple will also, as promised, be selling Sony’s PlayStation VR2 Sense controller and Controller Charging Station, supported by visionOS 26. It’ll cost $249.95 and be available on November 11.</p>
<p>The new Vision Pro will be available starting on October 22, with preorders up now for customers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the UAE, the UK, and the U.S.; mainland China and Singapore pre-orders start on Friday.</p>
<p>Those hoping for a price change will be disappointed: it still starts at $3,499 with storage tiers in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB at the same prices as before. In addition to the new Dual Knit Band, it includes the same Light Seal, pair of Light Seal Cushions, cover, polishing cloth, battery, and USB-C cable. However it also includes Apple’s recently announced 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max, though it seems like an expensive way to get that if you want it.</p>
