<p>Punk rock and heavy metal were two genres that evolved over the ‘70s, but seemed to run parallel to each other, despite sharing common fashion, sounds, and attitudes. But then there are moments in history, where everybody plays together in the same sandbox. For example, the above remastered audio, which captures the Australian band AC/DC on their first American tour, playing New York’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBGB">CBGB</a>, synonymous now with punk and new wave music.</p>
<p>The date is August 24, 1977, and AC/DC were on a cross-country trip that had taken in both club dates and arenas, where they supported—yes, hard to believe, I know—REO Speedwagon. Their album <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1S1VhL4">Let There Be Rock</a></em> had just dropped in June. The band would be in the States until the winter.</p>

<p>This CBGB gig finds them on the same bill as Talking Heads and the Dead Boys, according to <a href="https://dangerousminds.net/content/uploads/images/acdcatcbgbaugst1977q0293uf09uwe0fjalsdf.jpg">a poster from the time</a>. And while there’s no video for this show, you can find <a href="https://www.thefeedbacksociety.com/music/acdc-live-at-cbgb-in-1977/">a few photos that document the concert here</a>. You can feel the muggy New York summer in these photos, but also the excitement of an unforgettable gig.</p>
<p>At 15 minutes, the set is short, but still three minutes longer than the Ramones’ first set at the same club three years earlier. That’s pretty metal, man.</p>
