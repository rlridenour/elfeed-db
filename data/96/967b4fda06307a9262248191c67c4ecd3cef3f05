<p>President Prabowo Subianto on Monday bestowed the title of national hero on the late dictator Suharto, a move that drew strong condemnation from rights groups, victims&#x27; families and pro-democracy activists. Suharto ruled for three decades and his tenure is widely associated in reporting with mass rights abuses, entrenched corruption and nepotism; critics say the award amounts to an attempt to whitewash that record. The ceremony — presided over by President Prabowo and attended by members of Suharto’s family — was part of a broader set of national honours announced at the same time and has intensified debate over historical memory in Indonesia.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/g7FcXbq9bQU6nrJt1zRG2IJV9ofv8pgfXihl9WyeOyrST4NECce5LqnXqth4O6DrNGmxJDepshkJvpBEHNe9PiTRJ4ho4WtkpRumPk15q4j0FWyK24ZDedJPpnbPu0fTYPwr2BXReH6J2AKYp77-OR2ExyQJOA9ONE-3SF-iz2B2ThBxu3ojSq0nNkSdshj92zPrBPldgGgPfxppMD00TQ' alt='Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana and Bambang Trihatmodjo accepted the honor from President Prabowo Subianto in Jakarta on Monday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ceremony scope: Prabowo announced a group of ten national heroes in the same ceremony that included Suharto’s posthumous award.</li><li>Victims&#x27; response: Families of those affected and pro-democracy activists publicly protested the decision and called it a betrayal of victims.</li><li>Record of abuses: Reporting cites accusations against Suharto’s three-decade rule including mass human rights violations, pervasive corruption, censorship and nepotism.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Indonesia (President Prabowo): The president presided over the ceremony that conferred the title and presented the award to Suharto’s family.
