<p>Really enjoying these Evergreen Filberts and Flats from <a href="https://www.rosemaryandco.com/">Rosemary and Co Brushes</a> They’re synthetic, soft and springy. May not be totally clear in the pic but they have green fibres and hold a good shape. I keep ‘em in good condition by suspending them in baby oil between painting sessions.</p>
