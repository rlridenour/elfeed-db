<p>A Russian drone strike hit a bus carrying mine workers in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region on Sunday, killing at least 12 people, with some outlets reporting up to 15 or 16 deaths, and injuring others. Officials and the energy company DTEK said the victims were energy-sector employees returning from a shift. The attack came as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a new round of talks involving Ukraine and Russia in Abu Dhabi on February 4–5, amid uncertainty around any pause in strikes on energy infrastructure.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/94ru0jZbmGfOCmJ372OVoCC-V1x4aqMkZG1wCLFUekF5srEJ800bJI57u7iocIu075PhJFza18ahMa6bUfTVJrVoVmBsUGeiCGT5Gl81Ddg42dp7ccfrvchFs6pHk9jBS1q7uVQoAvDnqJx3uCdda9qRZsVz_ztbBgES4zkoC9xwF1ITqsYoOxJleLAq-TC7h20Sef74RPkgU0oTJ9HLOxYOSFJLO0r9hH18xl7y3mj_3qdXuLoBezn60Q' alt='Authorities say the attack targeted miners on a company bus in Ukraine&#x27;s Dnipropetrovsk region.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Where it happened: Ukrainian police said the bus was traveling roughly 65km (about 40 miles) from the frontline when it was struck.</li><li>Broader strikes: Separate strikes damaged a maternity hospital and other buildings in Zaporizhzhia, with regional officials reporting injuries there.</li><li>Winter pressure: The New York Times linked the attack to pressure on Ukraine’s energy sector during a winter freeze, noting Russia’s broader damage to the power grid and the use of government-provided warming tents in Kyiv.</li><li>Diplomacy backdrop: ABC reported the bus strike occurred ahead of US-brokered trilateral talks expected in the coming week.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine government officials: Ukrainian officials described the bus strike as a deliberate attack on energy workers and reported casualties and injuries from the incident.
