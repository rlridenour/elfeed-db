If you make a call and are placed on hold, a new feature in ‌iOS 26‌ will do the waiting for you so you can do other things. Hold Assist listens for hold music playing, and then alerts you when a person comes on the line so you can pick up the call.<br/>

Hold Assist is available on any iPhone that supports iOS 26 (i.e. it's not an Apple Intelligence feature). The feature works automatically on demand – there are no settings to toggle and no setup required. Still, there are a few things worth knowing. Here's what to expect when the time comes to use it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Enabling Hold Assist on a Call</h2><br/>
When you're placed on hold during a phone call, Hold Assist will launch automatically after 10 to 15 seconds. You'll know about it when a notification appears on your screen asking "Hold this Call?" Tap the <strong>Hold</strong> button to activate Hold Assist, or tap the X to dismiss the notification and stay on the line yourself.<br/>

<h2>While Hold Assist Is Active</h2><br/>
Once you tap Hold, you'll return to your iPhone's Home screen. A notification will appear briefly, confirming that you're on hold and that you'll be alerted when it's time to pick up the call.<br/>
<br/>
You can continue with whatever else you were doing on your iPhone, and the call will continue in the background. On iPhones with a Dynamic Island, you'll see this as a Live Activity. On other models, the time in the upper left corner appears in a green bubble, which is also what you see when you exit the Phone app during calls.<br/>
<br/>
When Hold Assist detects that a live person has answered, you'll receive a notification. Simply tap it to return to the call. <br/>

Note that Hold Assist works by detecting hold music, so it may struggle with voice-based automated messages or music with distinct lyrics. You'll see a transcript of any spoken words, so this should help you know when an actual person is on the line.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Manually Activating Hold Assist</h2><br/>
If you initially dismissed the Hold Assist notification and now want to activate it, you can do so manually. During an active call where you're on hold, simply tap the <strong>More</strong> button (three dots), then tap <strong>Hold Assist</strong> from the menu.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-26-make-your-iphone-wait-on-hold-for-you/">iOS 26: Make Your iPhone Wait on Hold for You</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-make-your-iphone-wait-on-hold-for-you.2468601/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
