<p>President Trump hosted Colombian President Gustavo Petro at the White House in Washington after months of sharp public exchanges over drug trafficking, regional security and Venezuela policy, in a meeting both sides framed as an attempt to reset ties between the allies. The encounter comes only weeks after Trump threatened possible military action against Colombia and labeled Petro an &quot;illegal drug leader&quot; and a &quot;sick man&quot; he accused of enabling cocaine flows to the United States, accusations Petro strongly rejected. Petro, a left-wing former guerrilla and outspoken critic of several recent US actions in Latin America and the Middle East, arrived with a mandate from his advisers to bring concrete proposals on counter-narcotics cooperation and to avoid further escalation in rhetoric during the visit. Despite the frosty lead-up, the White House meeting was portrayed as a chance to explore a thaw, with both governments under pressure to manage migration, tackle organized crime and maintain a working relationship between two countries that have long been key security partners in the Western Hemisphere.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/oh38qf-XCIjlDIgq2I6lQALdnespsg2I4iXQLMvO_hfYSr8LeiAc5Wi7MecLguV3DnrJRNyIN8AJm70Hp-SwfUvLpifBOo8S0KPAZ95zJKVVERh9eYD7qREsN9PcLx1uJ2-f19TBn_b-OrGDqyreYrjWkXZCl_5lMW2L57DoBGHtMo3VJ_9Gl8bzfDxI0w' alt='Presidents Donald Trump and Gustavo Petro meet at the White House following months of tense exchanges over drugs and regional policy.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Low‑profile visit: US officials kept Petro’s White House visit relatively low‑key, with limited public schedule details and minimal advance publicity compared to typical state-level encounters, underscoring the political sensitivity of the talks in both capitals.</li><li>Extradition gesture: Colombia sent a last‑minute extradition of a figure wanted by the United States shortly before the meeting, a move described in local coverage as part of a broader effort by Bogotá to show cooperation on security ahead of Petro’s arrival in Washington.</li><li>Focus on cocaine trade: Petro planned to present information intended to convince Trump that Colombian authorities are intensifying efforts against cocaine production and trafficking, amid US concerns that flows of the drug across the region remain high.</li><li>Venezuela disagreements: The leaders also had to navigate deep differences over Venezuela, where Petro has criticized US actions while Washington expects Bogotá to help apply pressure on Caracas and manage cross‑border impacts such as migration and smuggling.</li><li>Communication challenge: Advisers around Petro saw his task as balancing firm defense of Colombian sovereignty with a diplomatic tone that could de‑escalate his highly personal dispute with Trump and restore channels for technical cooperation between both governments.</li></ul><blockquote>The visit comes as relations between the two leaders have been strained by public accusations and harsh language on both sides. - Unnamed correspondent (narration)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Trump has repeatedly accused Petro of pumping cocaine into the United States and even threatened possible military action against Colombia in response to what he describes as Petro’s failure to curb drug trafficking.
