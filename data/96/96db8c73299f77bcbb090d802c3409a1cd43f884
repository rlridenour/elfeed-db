Scenario: I have a directory full of code files (in this case, 51 of them) that each need a find-and-replace executed; however, it is adding a line to part of the code, so replace one line with several. This means that SED cannot do the trick; you&rsquo;ll get errors like,
&gt; &gt; &gt; sed: -e expression #1, char 49: unterminated `s&#39; command Rather than spending the time figuring out how to encode things for SED, the simplest solution was just to use emacs inimitable dired.
