<p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly acknowledged that “several thousand” people were killed during weeks of anti-government protests and the ensuing crackdown, after rights groups reported death tolls in the thousands. In a televised speech, he described some killings as “inhuman” and “savage,” while accusing President Trump and the United States of driving or exploiting the unrest and calling the President a “criminal” for backing protesters. President Trump rejected Iran’s claims and responded publicly, further sharpening an already tense U.S.–Iran standoff as Iranians remain divided between demands for change and fears of instability.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/dhULINzvNrVom0SfgWIGJNYePMzDhwF8U3a1YUcjW7bRmtsKTHtxZi_7RrMVqM2RmGJeBnS5aQVdDmXAre7sf3KHzMu29DCyrg9SiGvHc1xHIAl-9cLQKN1aJq3Ll6Y2MJ6ZDapva5hUascA3_XLOcFPWW2z2jjaWLwnFiv4n9hX0I3ESaXKCaHwdRjZCGr6GDeGSGuDRuQIzC7z2g2mBhN1fX3D1YOv6Tmsz6c5jPRUkoh_3HnwuBF-Gw7AfkS8m6TNWVZU-lgCbDAOmA' alt='A man holds a poster of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a funeral for security forces killed during protests, Tehran, Jan. 14, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>First official figure: Several outlets noted this was the first time an Iranian leader signaled the scale of fatalities from the protest wave that began late December.</li><li>Blame at home: Khamenei also faulted demonstrators for provoking violence and framed the unrest as tied to foreign interference, according to state-televised remarks described by multiple reports.</li><li>Protester frustration: Some protesters interviewed said they felt misled after expecting U.S. help—citing earlier statements that the U.S. would “rescue” them if authorities started shooting—only to see no meaningful intervention as arrests mounted.</li><li>Trump response: CBS reported President Trump “punched back” at Iran’s accusation that Washington caused the protests, signaling Washington does not accept responsibility for the violence.</li><li>Rights groups counts: Rights groups cited by Japan Today said the unrest and crackdown had led to more than 3,000 deaths, a figure separate from Iran’s own characterization.</li></ul><blockquote>We consider Trump guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations against Iran. - Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (Iran’s supreme leader): He acknowledged mass casualties, condemned some killings as “inhuman” and “savage,” and accused President Trump/the U.S. of fueling the unrest while calling Trump a “criminal” for backing protesters.
