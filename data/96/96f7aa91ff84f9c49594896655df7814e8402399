I found this on the  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/583028159792079">Laughing Librarian</a> Facebook page, so I don’t know have the specific source, but it’s too good not to share.

 <blockquote>

 <p>
“You sound a very educated man for a barbarian,” said Rincewind.
</p>

 <p>
“I didn’t start out a barbarian. I used to be a school teacher. But I decided to give it all up and make a living by the sword.”
</p>

 <p>
“After being a teacher all your life?”
</p>

 <p>
“It did mean a change of perspective, yes.”
</p>

 <p>
“But … well… surely … the privation, the terrible hazards, the daily risk of death…”
</p>

 <p>
Mr Saveloy brightened up. “Oh, you’ve been a teacher, have you?”
</p>
