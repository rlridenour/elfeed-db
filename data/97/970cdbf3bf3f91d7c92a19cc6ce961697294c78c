According to a new post from the Weibo user known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>," Apple's first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will likely cost between &#36;2,100 and &#36;2,300—just a little more than Samsung's high-end foldable.<br/>
<br/>
The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 starts at &#36;1,899.99, while the Galaxy Z Flip6 starts at &#36;1,219.99. Apple's first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is expected to have a book-like design that folds horizontally, just like the Z Fold. The rumored pricing would make Apple's foldable around &#36;200–&#36;400 more expensive than Samsung's equivalent offering.<br/>
<br/>
For comparison, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max starts at &#36;1,199, but when configured with 1TB of storage that increases to &#36;1,599. This means that Apple's first foldable will still be around &#36;1,000 more expensive than the current flagship &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
