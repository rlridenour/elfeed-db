<p>European Union member states gave the green light for the bloc to sign a long-negotiated free trade agreement with the South American Mercosur bloc, marking the end of a roughly 25-year bargaining process. The agreement is expected to be formally signed in Paraguay in the near future, with reporting pointing to Asunción and a planned signing date of Jan. 17. Supporters frame the move as a way to deepen EU ties with South America and strengthen the EU’s global economic position, while opponents—especially some European farmers—warn it could intensify competition for agricultural producers. Even after this approval, questions remain about whether and how the deal will ultimately enter into force, because it still faces political and procedural hurdles in Europe.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JvdouUOHVatt9T-PH_t-d_TvZ7-xeKqQw7VQkw8lOcOoR1F96qI5XjUUMcVgngdQL3FLSf7tos_fS6zi2b1NKwErHWD77wiv9yqIMz8ZsVfC2dUHEDHgmAGM2bAnS6VCKA6m2kAsDCvbfA4mJ3EB13bPy_eoDroMla0L-dB51Epfgd4UTVOA3ZMAbdedqr_3rPU6ODfssMn5ZJ1D1gmciK1HV3MKw80pTz5o4dzzJcQJua3ARKGtgCWEE3ecA0g' alt='Polish farmers protest the announced signing of the EU-Mercosur agreement in Warsaw, January 9, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Qualified majority: A qualified majority of EU countries backed the agreement, and France and allied governments did not reach the threshold needed to block it.</li><li>Early application: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen raised the possibility of putting parts of the agreement into effect before Members of the European Parliament vote, a step that has added to the political tension around the deal.</li><li>Limited GDP boost: One analysis cited expectations that the agreement would add about 0.05% to the EU economy, suggesting the political debate may outweigh the near-term macroeconomic gains.</li><li>Trade geopolitics: Supportive governments and commentators have linked the deal to the EU’s effort to stay competitive amid rising U.S. tariffs and China’s economic weight in global trade.</li><li>Farmer pushback: Protests and political pressure from farmers have featured prominently in several EU countries, with the reporting highlighting demonstrations such as those in Warsaw.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Commission: The Commission says it took account of farmers’ concerns as it pursued the agreement and now seeks to move it toward signature and implementation.
