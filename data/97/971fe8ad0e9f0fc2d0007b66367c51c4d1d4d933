<p>Venezuela’s acting president, Delcy Rodríguez, announced plans to send a “general amnesty” bill to the National Assembly that could free hundreds of people detained for political reasons, including opposition figures, journalists, and human rights activists. Rodríguez framed the proposal as an effort to “heal” divisions after years of political confrontation, and several outlets reported that the legislature is expected to debate the text soon. Alongside the amnesty push, Rodríguez said the government intends to close or repurpose the capital’s notorious El Helicoide detention facility—long criticized by rights groups—and convert it into a center focused on sport and social services, while also promising changes to a major prison complex. The measures are presented by the interim authorities as part of a broader attempt to restore justice and lower political tensions, though the bill’s scope includes exclusions for people accused of serious crimes such as killings, human rights abuses, and drug trafficking.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DBgOkFraN7jBPZNEoiLnll77aiY7kIQyvNf2g18HeTV_my3Bk3C93qa3qXt91MJk4M8wQBxmwuPw7ZJPJ26_2xOO1n8uRhVwWqdh5yB0wRxT7gPFRE37cmuVgmGo9oMe18Oz32Gtjcxnf2bYp6iWz79Wr37wt2Bwxyt_CDHWTPGfhQ8fqw' alt='Relatives hug during a demonstration demanding the release of political prisoners in Caracas on January 30, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scope window: Le Monde reported the draft is intended to cover the period of political violence from 1999—when Hugo Chávez took power—to the present.</li><li>Legislative pace: Rodríguez told a gathering of justices and magistrates that the ruling party-controlled National Assembly would take up the bill “with urgency”.</li><li>Exclusions listed: The Straits Times said the planned amnesty would not apply to people accused of killings, human rights abuses, or drug trafficking.</li><li>Diplomatic signal: Le Monde reported that the United States said it plans to re-establish its diplomatic presence in Venezuela following the announcement.</li><li>Conditional releases: Firstpost said the proposed law would also address the situation of former prisoners who have already received conditional release.</li></ul><blockquote>May it be a law that serves to heal the wounds left by political confrontation, violence and extremism. - Delcy Rodríguez</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Delcy Rodríguez and interim government: Rodríguez presented the amnesty initiative as a way to heal political divisions and announced plans to shut and repurpose El Helicoide into a sports and social services center.
