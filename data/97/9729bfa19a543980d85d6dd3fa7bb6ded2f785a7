<hr />

<p>Before I cover the changes, a brief note about the canonical source of
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code> source code and corresponding documentation.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code> are built into Emacs, as of version 28, but they
are not developed in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emacs.git</code>: I maintain my own Git repository
(<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes</a>) and sync with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emacs.git</code> whenever I publish a new version, such as this one. This
means that my code is often ahead of the one in the Emacs tree
(including the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch). Similarly, the official manual, which
is hosted on my website (<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes</a>),
covers topics not found in the corresponding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gnu.org</code> web pages.</p>

<p>In the opening section of the manual I include references to the
canonical sources, but I still get comments about GNU web pages that I
do not control. Please check those links before reporting issues that
I can do nothing about.</p>

<h2>No more SourceHut</h2>

<p>Development continues on GitHub with GitLab as a mirror. I explained
my reasons here: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-01-27-sourcehut-no-more/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-01-27-sourcehut-no-more/</a>.</p>

<p>This is a change that affects all my Emacs packages.</p>

<h2>Code blocks now have a background by default</h2>

<p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-org-blocks</code> is obsolete. All code blocks
now have a subtle grey background out-of-the-box. The block delimiter
lines, such as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#+begin_src</code> in Org mode, use the same background
as the block’s contents. This produces a style that (i) is easy to
notice and (ii) employs minimal colouration. Furthermore, we no longer
have any discrepancy between Org and similar modes like Markdown.</p>

<p>Every theme has relevant semantic palette mappings to affect the
underlying faces:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-prose-block-delimiter</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-prose-block-delimiter</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-prose-block-contents</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The old <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prose-block</code> is now renamed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-prose-block-delimiter</code>.
Please update any such references in your configuration file.</p>

<p>Users can customise those either for all themes via the user option
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-common-palette-overrides</code>  or on a per-theme basis with
something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-operandi-palette-overrides</code>. The manual includes
ready-to-use code samples that showcases the numerous permutations made
possible by these new mappings: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes#h:f44cc6e3-b0f1-4a5e-8a90-9e48fa557b50">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes#h:f44cc6e3-b0f1-4a5e-8a90-9e48fa557b50</a>.</p>

<p>The old option to affect the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-src-block-faces</code> as to
have a different background for each specified programming language is
no longer available. The previous design was inflexible, as I was
hardcoding values for a few languages. Whereas it is better to empower
the user with the choice of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">language-&gt;colour</code> association. The manual
shows how to do this:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes#h:8c842804-43b7-4287-b4e9-8c07d04d1f89">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes#h:8c842804-43b7-4287-b4e9-8c07d04d1f89</a>.</p>

<h2>More semantic mappings more inline code in prose-centric modes</h2>

<p>For Org, Markdown, and related we have semantic palette mappings that
target inline code constructs. For example, in Org we can have text
inside of tilde signs to mark it up as code. In prior versions, the
mappings were limited to just a foreground, but now they cover
background values as well. By default, these background do not have a
colour associated with them, meaning that the out-of-the-box aesthetic
is the same as before. Users simply have more power at their disposal
to tweak the theme to their liking.</p>

<p>Here are the names of those mappings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-prose-code</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-prose-code</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-prose-macro</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-prose-macro</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-prose-verbatim</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-prose-verbatim</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The old <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prose-code</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prose-macro</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prose-verbatim</code> are named
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-prose-code</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-prose-macro</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-prose-verbatim</code>. Please
update any such references in your configuration file.</p>

<p>The manual shows lots of examples on how to benefit from these
optional backgrounds: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes#h:bb5b396f-5532-4d52-ab13-149ca24854f1">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes#h:bb5b396f-5532-4d52-ab13-149ca24854f1</a>.</p>

<h2>No colour-coding for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient.el</code> buffers.</h2>

<p>In a recent version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient.el</code>, there is a new user option that
applies colour-coding to keys (e.g. we see those while using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">magit</code>):
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient-semantic-coloring</code>. This option is enabled by default,
changing the previous style that was used as a reference for all my
designs.</p>

<p>The idea with such colour coding is to indicate when a key continues
to display the transient, exits with a given action, and the like. For
our purposes this interface cannot work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We need some place to teach users what each colour means, as there
are no indicators of any sort to help them (whereas, say, in diff
buffers we have the plus and minus signs).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not all hues are suitable for highlighting a single character. In
light themes, for example, green and yellow colours are awkward
choices for the requirements of this interface where the key must be
clearly visible. But when we introduce multiple colours, each with
their own meaning, we will not be able to avoid those hues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The style of key bindings is not limited to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient.el</code>. We find
them when we invoke <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x</code>, do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x describe-bindings</code>, while using
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">which-key</code> package, and many more. If we are to change how
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient.el</code> shows key bindings, then we have to retain the same
visual cues for other contexts. Otherwise, everything is inconsistent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All themes must use the same colours to preserve the colour coding,
thus removing an important aspect of their presentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This whole paradigm does not work for themes that are optimised for
users with colour deficiency, due to the reduced number of suitable
hues. With deuteranopia, for example, we can only rely on yellow and
blue: since yellow is not optimal for single key highlights against
a light backdrop, blue is the only hue that works in such a context.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code> will never support <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient-semantic-coloring</code>.
All relevant faces use the style of standard key bindings.</p>

<p>Themes can enforce user option values, but I have decided to change
the faces instead to better communicate my intent. If a user wants
semantic colouring, they can change the faces to whatever they like.</p>

<p>I understand this is a radical measure, though it is the best I can do
given the circumstances. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient.el</code> where to have accompanying
characters that better denote what each key does (e.g. the plus sign
is for keys that continue the transient), then I am happy to apply
appropriate colours to those and reconsider the aforementioned.</p>

<h2>Semantic mappings for active arguments and values</h2>

<p>In various interfaces such as of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eldoc-mode</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient.el</code> there
are highlights for the current argument or argument value. These now
have corresponding semantic palette mappings and are thus styled
uniformly (and can be overridden accordingly). The mappings are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-active-argument</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-active-argument</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-active-value</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fg-active-value</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>A semantic mapping for formulas in tables</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prose-table-formula</code> applies to inline formula expressions in
plain text tables. Org mode uses those, as does the minor mode <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">orgtbl-mode</code>.
The inline formula is meant to stand out from the rest of the table,
without exaggerations.</p>

<h2>Matching parentheses have semantic mappings for their foreground too</h2>

<p>By default, Emacs will highlight the matching (opening or closing)
delimiter when the cursor is next to it. This is useful in Lisp
programming modes, for example, as we can quickly get a sense of where
an expression starts and ends.</p>

<p>The themes now provide mappings for the foreground of those
delimiters. This means that users can either change the combination of
background and foreground or opt to only display a foreground value
for a more minimal look.</p>

<p>As always, the manual shows concrete examples:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes#h:259cf8f5-48ec-4b13-8a69-5d6387094468">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes#h:259cf8f5-48ec-4b13-8a69-5d6387094468</a>.</p>

<h2>Search highlights have their own semantic mappings</h2>

<p>This makes it easier to differentiate their style on a per-theme
basis, which I do for all the Modus themes. It also gives users the
option to override the colours. The mappings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-search-current</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-search-lazy</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-search-replace</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-search-rx-group-0</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-search-rx-group-1</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-search-rx-group-2</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-search-rx-group-3</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Stylistic tweaks to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-operandi-tinted</code></h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-operandi-theme</code> uses a light ochre background, which gives
a warmer feel than the pure white background of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-operandi</code>. To
better contribute to this warmth, I made some tweaks to common
elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The cursor has a red hue as before, but the value is a bit more
intense now. This makes it easier to spot in contexts where text is
already “warm”, like close to an Org <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TODO</code> keyword or in
programming mode comments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All key bindings have a red hue instead of blue. We can notice the
effect in Help mode buffers that mention where a command is bound,
while using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">which-key-mode</code>, in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient.el</code> buffers, in
minibuffer completion annotations, and more.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These are in addition to many nuances already built into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-operandi-tinted</code>.</p>

<p>I hope that existing users will appreciate these tweaks. We anyway
have the option to override any entry in the palette, though I suggest
you give these a chance before enacting any changes.</p>

<h2>Stylistic tweaks to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-vivendi-tinted</code></h2>

<p>Same principle here as with the above set of changes. Namely:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The cursor uses a more intense magenta background to be easier to
spot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Key bindings are purple instead of blue to better complement the
aesthetics of this theme.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The background highlight applied to matching parentheses (per
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show-paren-mode</code>) is grey-cyan instead of cyan.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Again, we can override everything but please try those for a little
while.</p>

<h2>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olivetti-fringe</code> is visible when needed</h2>

<p>This is subject to the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olivetty-style</code>, which can be set
to the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fancy</code> to produce a page-like effect.</p>

<p>Thanks to Dhavan Vaidya and Gautier Ponsinet for bringing this matter
to my attention on the now-discontinued mailing list:
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/modus-themes/%3Cm2a5qzpi3y.fsf%40muon.local.mail-host-address-is-not-set%3E">https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/modus-themes/%3Cm2a5qzpi3y.fsf%40muon.local.mail-host-address-is-not-set%3E</a></p>

<h2>A more subtle style for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-preview-insertion</code> face</h2>

<p>The default value of that face inherits from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">region</code> face. This
is fine in some cases, though not when the user calls
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-outline</code> in a buffer with hidden text (e.g. Org folded
headings). There the background is applied to the entire heading’s
surface area, which is too distracting while cycling through
completion candidates and inspecting the preview.</p>

<h2>Simpler <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">imenu-list</code> with four colours</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">imenu-list</code> defines two sets of faces which apply to same heading
levels but differ on whether the heading has subheadings or not.
Before, we would colourise those differently, which could be
confusing. Now they look the same, which is fine because the interface
has additional markup to show when subheadings are present.</p>

<p>Thanks to ltmsyvag for pointing this out in issue 95:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/95">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/95</a>.</p>

<h2>Implicit buttons in Gnus are no longer underlined</h2>

<p>Gnus buttonises text that it considers actionable. The exact
functionality depends on the context, but it basically does stuff like
add a quick way to write a new message to a given email address. These
buttons can be mistaken for links, so I am removing their underline to
avoid any possible confusion.</p>

<h2>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">message-separator</code> face is less intense</h2>

<p>In message/email composition buffers, there is a line that
distinguishes headers from the body of the message. By default, it
reads <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--text follows this line--</code> and will now have a subtle grey
background. The idea is to not stress the distinction between headers
and body, as this line’s verbosity is already enough to call attention
to it when we add a subtle background.</p>

<h2>Recalibrated all “nuanced” background values</h2>

<p>Each theme has a subset of slightly accented background named
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg-{red,green,blue,yellow,magenta,cyan}-nuanced</code>. These have slightly
different values to be more consistent in terms of their intensity.</p>

<h2>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">debbugs</code> package is now supported</h2>

<p>Thanks to Gautier Ponsinet for sending me the relevant patch to my
personal email. I made further stylistic changes on top.</p>

<h2>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ztree</code> package is covered as well</h2>

<p>It produces a diff between two directories and thus needs appropriate
colours.</p>

<h2>Added support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xterm-color</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rustic-mode</code></h2>

<p>These are basically reusing styles we already support for other
terminal emulators. Thanks to Tony Zorman for the contribution, which
was done in pull request 99: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/pull/99">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/pull/99</a>.</p>

<h2>Org checkboxes are monospaced when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-mixed-fonts</code> is non-nil</h2>

<p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-mixed-fonts</code> makes specing-sensitive
elements use a monospaced font (specifically, the font family of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixed-pitch</code> face). This lets the user set a more prose-friendly
style without visually breaking snippets that rely on fixed width
spacing. A prose-friendly style is done by making the default font a
proportionately spaced one, or by enabling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">variable-pitch-mode</code> in
the current buffer.</p>

<p>For this case, we now cover Org checkboxes as well to avoid
misalignments in checklists.</p>

<p>Thanks to Gautier Ponsinet for discussing this with me via email and
sending the relevant patch.</p>

<h2>More code samples in the manual</h2>

<p>The manual documents everything about the customisation options
provided by the themes, as well as relevant do-it-yourself code
samples. I now include more examples and better explain how to hook
those either to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enable-theme-functions</code> or the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-after-load-theme-hook</code>. If something is not clear or not
covered at all, please let me know and I will help you do what you
want.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cl-</code> snippets are removed from the source code. We did not
really need them and I rewrote the code accordingly. This is not a
value judgement against Common Lisp patterns in Emacs Lisp (I do not
mind them): it is just a matter of removing a dependency for things
that can easily be done differently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keycast-key</code> inherits the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bold</code> face if the user option
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-bold-constructs</code> is set to a non-nil value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read-multiple-choice-face</code> now has a cooler hue than the one it
had before. This way it is not mistaken for a warning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">appt-notification</code> face uses a foreground value that is better
suited for the modeline, where this indicator appears.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">header-line-highlight</code> draws a box around it. This makes the
mouse hover effect easier to spot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shr-mark</code> face is now covered as well. It uses an appropriate
background colour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mct-highlight-candidate</code> face is covered and has an appropriate
style for the minibuffer completions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">completions-highlight</code> face (Emacs 29) is also supported to
ensure stylistic consistency between the minibuffer interfaces
covered by the themes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flagged and deleted messages in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mu4e</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notmuch</code> use different
hues to not conflate the two.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed the spelling of “colour” to “color” in the manual because core
Emacs uses the latter…</p>
  </li>
</ul>
