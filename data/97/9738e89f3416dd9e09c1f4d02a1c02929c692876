<p>Andy Stone, VP of communications at Meta, responding, in a series of tweets on Twitter/X, to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/meta-ceo-zuckerberg-blocked-curbs-sex-talking-chatbots-minors-court-filing-2026-01-27/">Jeff Horwitz’s report at Reuters</a> yesterday, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/27/horwitz-zuck-meta-teen-sexbots">linked here</a> last night, which claimed that “Zuckerberg blocked curbs on sex-talking chatbots for minors”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never let the facts get in the way of a good story, eh,
<a href="https://x.com/Reuters">@Reuters</a>, <a href="https://x.com/JeffHorwitz">@JeffHorwitz</a>!</p>

<p>The documents you cite in the story itself contradict this
headline.</p>

<p>The headline says “Zuckerberg blocked curbs on sex-talking
chatbots for minors”</p>

<p>But the story cites a document that says “Zuckerberg believed that
AI companions should be blocked from engaging in sexually
‘explicit’ conversations” w young people.</p>

<p>Huh?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After my post last night, a friend of mine, with a career of experience working in a large company, sent me this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A word of caution. “Scumbag middle manager says CEO said” is not
the same as “CEO said.”</p>

<p>I could believe Zuck shitcanned parental controls, but I am
certain there are thousands of snakes inside that company who
would lie about it to get what they want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a good and fair point, and I think it’s what Stone is trying to emphasize above. The New Mexico lawsuit filing doesn’t contain evidence that Zuckerberg nixed parental controls for teens engaging in chats with AI bots; it contains evidence that other (unnamed employees) claimed in internal discussions that Zuckerberg had nixed them. That is different.</p>

<p>But so let’s take Zuckerberg out of it personally. It’s still the case that Meta shipped these chatbots for teens to use. And the buck, presumably, stops at Zuck’s desk. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/">Read Horwitz’s report from back in August</a>, detailing a leaked internal document listing Meta’s content guidelines for generative AI chat.</p>

<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> Why in the world is Meta’s VP of comms doing this on Twitter/X, not Threads, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/">continues to grow</a>?</p>
