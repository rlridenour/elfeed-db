Apple today opened its latest retail store <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/perthcity/">at Forrest Place</a>, a pedestrianized area in the heart of Perth, the largest city in Western Australia.<br/>

The new store is in a historic building originally built for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, at the corner of Forrest Place and Murray Street.<br/>
<br/>
"Our team meticulously restored and mended heritage fabric throughout the building, including the marble tiling, ceilings, and plaster columns, to create a truly unique space for customers to shop," said Apple's retail chief Deirdre O'Brien, in an interview about the store <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/apple-perth-city-new-forrest-place-store-to-offer-guided-tech-tours-and-pick-up-counter-in-australia-firsts-c-19147917">with Perth's local newspaper <em>The West Australian</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's nearby Hay Street store permanently closed a few days ago, after 15 years of business.<br/>
<br/>
The new store is larger and more modern than the original location, and the heritage building that it resides in makes it a so-called "flagship" location.<br/>
<br/>
In a first for Australia, the store has an Apple Pickup station for collecting online orders.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/26/new-apple-store-perth-australia/">New Apple Store in Australia Now Open Inside a Historic Bank Building</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-store-in-australia-now-open-inside-a-historic-bank-building.2459763/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
