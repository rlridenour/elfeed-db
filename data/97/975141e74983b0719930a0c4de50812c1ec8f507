<p>In the latest development in northeast Syria, renewed clashes between Syrian government forces and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have shaken a newly announced ceasefire and governance deal, with fighting reported around areas tied to detention sites. During the violence, Islamic State (IS/ISIL) detainees escaped from a prison in al-Shaddadi, prompting a search operation and competing claims over who enabled the breakout. Estimates of the number who escaped vary sharply: Syria’s Interior Ministry cited about 120, while an SDF-linked account cited a far higher figure. Officials say security forces have already rearrested some escapees, offering a modest sign of containment even as talks and trust between the sides remain strained.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Qwz07iDHeOmL6ATD2qkFLK_1vmyr8Dqlrn7HyFtMCtokO8u7IpS_e71oOPyDU7dHjnRziRpDBdhpJDk7T88Xz-A2XrAZ8DJ51Hkv56TI93If01i0WERkfnsXcPdcodwZ1SZn_PWZ8bW4ycMMIPo_L2aOY6jjnTcne3Wy3kNGOff6tQsugBqpaTtPKHLvFDKs_CCgs50z' alt='Soldiers of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces deployed near the Gweiran Prison in Hasakah Province, northeastern Syria.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Prison handover: The flare-up came a day after the SDF agreed to hand control of prisons holding about 8,000 suspected IS fighters to the Syrian government, a move that quickly became a flashpoint on the ground.</li><li>Army movement: Al Jazeera reported Syrian army units moving into Hasakah as the ceasefire faced pressure, underscoring how quickly local deployments can test political deals.</li><li>SDF mobilization: The SDF issued a call for “all of our youth” to “join the ranks of the resistance,” signaling a hardening message after the new clashes.</li><li>Escape visuals: The SDF said it lost control of the prison building during the fighting and released video it said showed IS members escaping, while both sides accused the other of responsibility.</li><li>Ceasefire effort: Even with reported skirmishes, separate reporting said the Syrian army and SDF had begun implementing the ceasefire, suggesting some channels of coordination still exist.</li></ul><blockquote>All of our youth - Syrian Democratic Forces (statement)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Syrian Interior Ministry: The ministry said about 120 IS detainees escaped from Shaddadi prison and reported a recapture operation that it said brought many detainees back into custody.
