  <p>“Just tried calling you about new bid we have submitted,” Ellison
texted Zaslav. “I heard you on all your concerns and believe we
have addressed them in our new proposal. Please give me a call
back when you can to discuss in detail.”</p>

<p>He didn’t hear back.</p>

<p>Sensing trouble, Ellison followed up, saying Paramount had offered
a package that covered all the issues Warner had raised, including
the need for “strong cash value” and “speed to close.”</p>

<p>“It would be the honor of a lifetime to be your partner and to be
the owner of these iconic assets,” he texted, according to a
regulatory filing.</p>

<p>Desperation is never a good look.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During a visit to Washington in recent days, David Ellison offered
assurances to Trump administration officials that if he bought
Warner, he’d make sweeping changes to CNN, a common target of
President Trump’s ire, people familiar with the matter said. Trump
has told people close to him that he wants new ownership of CNN as
well as changes to CNN programming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lickspittling is never a good look, either. David Ellison cuts the figure of a pathetic little man, a mere shadow of his father. (I’ll bet he gets along well with Don Jr. and Eric.) And Trump is now already <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-netflix-warner-bros-battle-ellisons-a86fe15c?st=gwekR4&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">pissed that Ellison hasn’t turned</a> <em>60 Minutes</em> into <em>Fox and Friends</em>.</p>
