"We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and as we've said before, we expect to release these features next year," said Cook.<br/>

Apple today reported <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/apple-3q-2025-earnings/">record earnings results</a> for the third quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, with revenue of &#36;94 billion exceeding Wall Street expectations.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first announced the personalized Siri features during its WWDC 2024 keynote, but in March it announced that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">they were delayed</a>. The new capabilities will include better understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. For example, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.<br/>

Apple is facing multiple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/apple-intelligence-siri-lawsuit/">class action lawsuits</a> over the delayed features.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/tim-cook-shares-personalized-siri-update/">Tim Cook Says Apple is &#039;Making Good Progress&#039; on Personalized Siri Features Ahead of 2026 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-says-apple-is-making-good-progress-on-personalized-siri-features-ahead-of-2026-launch.2462564/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
