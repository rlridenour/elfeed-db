Echoing his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/rivian-explains-why-no-apple-carplay/">previous comments on the matter</a>, Scaringe said Rivian is focused on offering a "seamless digital experience," where customers do not need to switch between its own software and CarPlay. Instead, he said Rivian prefers to provide an à-la-carte selection of built-in apps, such as Apple Music, Google Maps, Spotify, and YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
Scaringe said he is "very confident" in Rivian's decision to skip CarPlay, especially as it plans to integrate AI into its vehicles over the next 18 months. For example, he said Rivian is planning a native AI-powered voice-to-text feature for messaging.<br/>
<br/>
"We're really convicted on this," he said.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, Scaringe acknowledged that some customers will not purchase a Rivian given the lack of CarPlay. "We accept that," he said.<br/>
<br/>
"Some of those decisions not everyone's going to agree with," he said. "That's okay."<br/>
