Opera has updated its <a href="https://www.opera.com/opera">flagship browser</a>, introducing a rebuilt AI engine and expanded multitasking features, as well as an animated UI theme that reacts to music playing in the browser.<br/>

The browser's AI assistant now uses architecture borrowed from Opera's experimental <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/30/opera-ai-browser-neon-launch/">Neon browser</a>, which the company says delivers 20% faster responses. Notably, the AI can now operate within the context of specific tabs or tab groups, so it doesn't mix up information across different browsing sessions. There's also a new YouTube integration that lets the AI analyze videos to find specific moments or summarize content.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, split-screen mode has been expanded from two tabs to four, with horizontal and grid layout options for users with larger displays.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Opera's Tab Islands feature, which automatically groups related tabs, can now be color-coded and named for easier identification. The sidebar has also gained Gmail and Google Calendar integration alongside existing support for messaging apps and music services.<br/>
<br/>
The company is also retiring its separate beta browser build in favor of an "early bird mode" toggle within the main browser.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, there are three new animated themes in this release, including one developed with Spotify that reacts to music playing in Opera's built-in player.
