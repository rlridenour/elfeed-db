<li>An erasable planner</li>
<li>Take photos and upload them, and then erase and start over</li>
<li>All letter size, all one color</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: No, but it can help you plan a margarita party, maybe?</li>
</ul><h1>Well Planned</h1><p>Alright, so: we’ve sold these a bunch of times. So many times, in fact, that we ran out of them. Or so we thought. But then, a miracle! We unearthed a few more in the warehouse. The only problem? They’re all the ‘letter’ size. And they’re all the same color.</p>
<p>(Not a huge issue, but we just want to clarify why this sale might be slightly different than the last few.)</p>
<p>The way this thing’s supposed to work is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fill out the pages that are “scientifically designed to help you overcome stress and become a productivity machine.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take photos of said pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upload those photos to the cloud, where you can access them with any of your devices. That way, you can always search and find old notes and entries. (Rocketbook boasts about their cutting edge handwriting recognition.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wipe the pages clean and start all over again.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But, of course, you don’t have to do exactly what they tell you. You don’t have to upload anything or even do all the exercises. This thing could just be an erasable to-do-list-maker with a few other planner pages that you use twice a year. And that’s cool, right?</p>
<p>Now, I need to apologize. For a previous Panda Planner sale, I outlined how we sometimes source such great products for such low cost that you’d think the price is typo before then pivoting to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not one of those things. No, unfortunately for all involved, this is the exact kind of item you expect to find on the site that takes in all of commerce’s cast-offs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it turns out, people love these. And what’s more, they love them for reasons I can totally relate to.</p>
<p><a href="/@emaw_az">@emaw_az</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I bought one of these for my wife a couple years ago for work and she honestly still goes on about how useful she finds it. She’s big on writing stuff down, especially to-do lists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="/@Oldelvis">@Oldelvis</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>have been a Rocketbook user for the last 5 years (starting with a knockoff product). After looking at all of the notebooks I had on my desk that I used to take notes on, that I never opened, this is what I now use instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like, emaw_az’s wife, when it comes to taking notes, I prefer to write stuff down. After all, there’s nothing worse than opening up my phone to add something to my calendar, only to then navigate away and lose twenty minutes reading an inane argument in the comments on an Instagram video about silly dogs.</p>
<p>And like Oldelvis, this penchant for writing stuff down has resulted in piles and piles of notebooks that contain story ideas, grocery lists, and phone numbers of plumbers in places I haven’t lived in a decade.</p>
<p>These might alleviate that problem.</p>
<p>So maybe I should get one.</p>
<p>And maybe you should too. After all, people like them.</p>
