<p>In the latest development in northern Syria, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters have left Aleppo after a ceasefire understanding with Syria’s transitional authorities, with buses transporting the final group out of Sheikh Maqsoud toward SDF-held areas in the northeast. The SDF said the deal also enabled the evacuation of wounded people, bodies, and trapped civilians from the Ashrafiyeh and Sheikh Maqsoud districts. The clashes erupted after talks on integrating the SDF’s administration and forces into the new Syrian state structures stalled, and the withdrawal is being framed by multiple parties as a step back from further fighting in the city.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/LvLOGQpx4ai-buBOYF8VoeNGIZtDMN15kUDZn9izHJJAF8hcD2xron6EUkMqi_k2i9zfgIBZC7eDRbR5n9YZkDTA3ofib3-LJb6KrXxKTLdD' alt='Residents in Aleppo’s Sheikh Maqsoud stand near damaged buildings after recent clashes.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Bus evacuations: AFP reporters cited by multiple outlets described several buses moving fighters out of the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsoud district under escort, with additional buses seen entering and leaving as the area calmed.</li><li>Operations halted: Syria’s military announced “a halt to all military operations” in Sheikh Maqsoud, according to state media carried by Dawn.</li><li>Surrender claim: Syrian state television said some Kurdish fighters who “announced their surrender” were transported by bus to Tabaqa in the northeast.</li><li>Diplomatic push: The US envoy, Tom Barrack, met Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa and called for a “return to dialogue” in line with an integration agreement sealed last year.</li><li>Negotiations urged: The United States and the European Union publicly urged Syrian authorities and Kurdish leaders to return to negotiations following the violence.</li></ul><blockquote>We reached an understanding that led to a ceasefire and secured the evacuation of the martyrs, the wounded, the trapped civilians and the fighters from Ashrafiyeh and Sheikh Maqsoud neighbourhoods to northern and eastern Syria - Syrian Democratic Forces (statement)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF): The SDF says it agreed to a ceasefire and evacuation arrangement that also covered trapped civilians and wounded people, with departures from Ashrafiyeh and Sheikh Maqsoud toward northern and eastern Syria.
