<p>Awarded by the Joint Committee of the <a href="https://www.dfg.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</a> (DFG, the German Research Foundation), the prize includes a €200,000n (approximately $218,000) fund to support research over the next three years.</p>
<p>Dr. Garcia was recognized for her work in political philosophy, feminist philosophy, and moral philosophy. She is the author of <em><span class="C9DxTc ">The Joy of Consent: A Philosophy of Good Sex</span></em><span class="C9DxTc "> (2021) and <em>We Are Not Born Submissive: How Patriarchy Shapes Women&#8217;s Lives</em> (2018), among other works.

<p>180 researchers from various fields were nominated for the prize this year, and ten were selected as winners.</p>
<p>Professor Garcia is the first philosopher to win a Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Prize since 1988. (At the time, different disciplines took turns each year and 1988 was philosophy&#8217;s year. Since 1997, the prizes have been open to nominees from all fields each year, but no philosopher has won one until now.)</p>
<p>The award ceremony will take place in Berlin in June.</p>
