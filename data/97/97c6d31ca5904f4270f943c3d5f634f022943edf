<p>I&rsquo;ll be back to posting some artwork soon. That feels long overdue and very much looking forward to it actually. Most of what I&rsquo;ve been doing has been personal sketchbook study that doesn&rsquo;t feel ready for public consumption anyway to be honest. Recent times have been taken up with organising a series of local events at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cityscreenyork">City Screen, Picture House in York</a> with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/navigatorsart">Navigators Art</a>. Last month <a href="https://bledley.xyz/posts/2023-10-11-navigators-art-punk-jazz-basement-city-screen/">Punk/Jazz</a> was a really fun night and a lot of folks turned out. Next weekend we have another installment in the form of &ldquo;The Basement Sessions #1&rdquo; with a nice variety of local talents taking the stage.</p>
<p><strong>LIVE, LOCAL AND LOUD!</strong>
An adventurous mixed bill of new music (bands and solo), comedy, spoken word and more - with a few surprises up its sleeve.
All performers are local to York &amp; area and are chosen for a spirit of experimentality and community - and of course for being excellent!
The venue is quite intimate with a mixture of standing and seated.</p>
