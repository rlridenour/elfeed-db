<p id="p1">Now this is what I call follow-up: <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/jason-snell-on-podcasting-with-only-an-ipad-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer">six years after I linked</a> to Jason Snell&rsquo;s first experiments with podcasting on the iPad Pro (which later became part of a chapter of my <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/11/#podcasting-from-ipad-pro" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond the Tablet story from 2019</a>), I get to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/06/a-few-notes-on-ipados-26-audio-and-video-capture/" rel="noopener noreferrer">link to Snell&rsquo;s first impressions</a> of iPadOS 26&rsquo;s brand new local capture mode, which lets iPad users record their own audio and video during a call.</p>
<p id="p2">First, some context:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  To ensure that the very best audio and video is used in the final product, we tend to use a technique called a &ldquo;multi-ender.&rdquo; In addition to the lower-quality call that&rsquo;s going on, we all record ourselves on our local device at full quality, and upload those files when we&rsquo;re done. The result is a final product that isn&rsquo;t plagued by the dropouts and other quirks of the call itself. I&rsquo;ve had podcasts where one of my panelists was connected to us via a plain old phone line&mdash;but they recorded themselves locally and the finished product sounded completely pristine.

<p id="p4">This is how I&rsquo;ve been recording podcasts since 2013. We used to be on a call on Skype and record audio with QuickTime; now we use Zoom, <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audio Hijack</a>, and OBS for video, but the concept is the same. Here&rsquo;s Snell on how the new iPadOS feature, which lives in Control Center, works:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  The file it saves is marked as an mp4 file, but it&rsquo;s really a container featuring two separate content streams: full-quality video saved in HEVC (H.265) format, and lossless audio in the FLAC compression format. Regardless, I haven&rsquo;t run into a single format conversion issue. My audio-sync automations on my Mac accept the file just fine, and Ferrite had no problem importing it, either. (The only quirk was that it captured audio at a 48KHz sample rate and I generally work at 24-bit, 44.1KHz. I have no idea if that&rsquo;s because of my microphone or because of the iPad, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter since converting sample rates and dithering bit depths is easy.)
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">I tested this today with a FaceTime call. Everything worked as advertised, and the call&rsquo;s MP4 file was successfully saved in my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive (I wish there was a way to change this). I was initially confused by the fact that recording automatically begins as soon as a call starts: if you press the Local Capture button in Control Center before getting on a call, as soon as it connects, you&rsquo;ll be recording. It&rsquo;s kind of an odd choice to make this feature just a&hellip;<em>Control Center toggle</em>, but I&rsquo;ll take it! My <a href="https://www.sounddevices.com/product/mixpre-3-ii/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MixPre-3 II audio interface</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/48GNGLE" rel="noopener noreferrer">microphone</a> worked right away, and I think there&rsquo;s a very good chance I&rsquo;ll be able to record <a href="https://appstories.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStories</a> and my other shows from my iPad Pro &ndash; with <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-for-everything/#ipad-pro-and-video-recording-for-macstories-podcasts" rel="noopener noreferrer">no more workarounds</a> &ndash; this summer.</p>
