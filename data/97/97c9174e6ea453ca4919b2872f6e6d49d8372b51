<p>If you like me and use CTRL-P/CTRL-N instead of arrow keys to navigate through command history, you should be disappointed
on how CTRL-P works in docker terminal (the one you see after docker run, docker exec).</p>
<p>It turned out CTRL-P is used for what they call detaching from terminal, which I didn&rsquo;t know about even.</p>
<p>So basically when you press CTRL-P the terminal is waiting for another key press (CTRL-Q in current case). That&rsquo;s why CTRL-P
works in strange way.</p>
<p>The issue <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/15666">was solved</a> couple of years ago.</p>
<p>What you need to do is create <code>.docker</code> folder in your home directory (<code>mkdir ~/.docker</code>) and create <code>config.json</code> file there with this content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span style="display:flex;"><span>{
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#f92672">&#34;detachKeys&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;ctrl-@&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><br/>
You can use other keys of course but CTRL-P should work as usual right now.
