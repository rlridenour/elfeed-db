<p>I very much have an analog side. Sometimes I find slowing down and writing things down helps me process thoughts a little better. That doesn&#8217;t mean the things I write with paper and pencil necessarily stay that way forever, but quite often, it&#8217;s an excellent first draft.</p>



<p>As an analog explorer, I&#8217;ve gone down the rabbit hole over the years of fancy pens, including fountain pens. But several years ago, I found an old box of pencils and decided on a whim to try using those. I never looked back.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to think of the simple pencil as that thing we used back in school, never to be touched again, but pencils have a lot of merits.</p>



<p><strong>They&#8217;re erasable.</strong> If you make a mistake, you can erase it and do it over. But that goes even deeper. Because it&#8217;s erasable, you can take a risk once in a while.</p>



<p><strong>They dry instantly.</strong>&nbsp;The fancier and more expensive your pen gets, it seems, the longer you have to wait for the ink to dry. Not so with a pencil.</p>



<p><strong>They work in extreme conditions.</strong>&nbsp;You can write with a pencil underwater, in extreme heat or cold, or even zero gravity. When I had a fountain pen, I was terrified to use it on an airplane because I kept reading about fountain pen explosions under airplane cabin pressure. That&#8217;s just not a thing when you use pencils.</p>



<p>I also find the process of sharpening pencils therapeutic. It gives me a minute to stop and think. Over the years, I&#8217;ve bought several different sharpeners, ranging from a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mobius-Ruppert-Artists-Pencil-Sharpener/dp/B01BRFCI4C/">simple hand twist</a> to a fancy one that&#8217;s <a href="https://www.makerscabinet.com/products/hovel">more akin to a hand plane</a>. They&#8217;re all delightful and give me a break to stop and think while writing.</p>



<p>Overall, there&#8217;s an appealing simplicity to pencils. There&#8217;s no cables or batteries or sync issues—you just pick it up and write. There’s also a strange sense of accomplishment when you use up a pencil down to the nib. I look at it and think, “I made something relevant with this.”</p>



<p>I like the way pencils embrace impermanence. Anything I write with my pencil is subject to change, and that&#8217;s okay. It almost invites mindfulness as you sit there, sharpening a pencil, and then listen to the scratch, scratch across the paper as you write down your thoughts.</p>



<p>I doubt this essay is going to get many converts. I think most people still think of pencils as things for third graders. But boy, do I love mine. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re curious, my favorite pencil is the <a href="https://www.nikkissupplystore.com/en-us/products/9852-ew-recycled-wood-pencil">Mitsubishi 9852 EW</a>. They are inexpensive and a pleasure to use.</p>
