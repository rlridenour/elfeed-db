<p>✨UPDATE✨ Journelly v1.3 <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-1-3-released">launched with Markdown support</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only">Journelly launched</a>, I <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only#no-lock-in-(powered-by-org-plain-text)">asked users to get in touch</a> if they were interested in Markdown support.</p>
<p>Since then, Markdown has by far been the most requested feature.</p>
<p>Today, I’m excited to share that Journelly beta builds now include initial Markdown support! If you’ve been in touch, you likely already have access. If not, <a href="mailto:journelly+markdown@xenodium.com?subject=I'm%20interested%20Markdown%20for%20Journelly&amp;body=Just%20want%20to%20register%20my%20interest%20in%20Markdown%20support%20for%20Journelly">let me know you’re interested</a>.</p>
<p>Journelly still defaults to Org as its preferred markup, but you can now switch to Markdown from the welcome screen or the menu.</p>

<p>While Org is my own markup of choice, it remains fairly niche. As I work to build a sustainable iOS app as a full-time indie developer, I need to reach a wider audience, without resorting to subscriptions. Luckily, I think we can have our cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>Here's how I see Journelly's audience breaking down:</p>
<h2>For anyone who just wants to write (regardless of markup)</h2>
<p>This has always been Journelly’s main goal. I've worked hard to keep the serialization format in the background, focusing instead on delivering a smooth, friction-free experience. The primary goal: just write.</p>
<p>I think this is working well. <a href="https://ellanew.com/">Ellane</a>'s post sums it up: <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/157-2025-05-19-journelly-is-org-for-those-who-dont-do-org">Journelly is the iOS Org App You’ll Love (Even if You Don’t Do Org)</a>.</p>
<p>If you just want a quick way to take notes or journal privately, Journelly already offers that. Adding quick notes, ideas, recipes, checklists, music, links, etc. is really easy and fast even if you don't do org (<a href="https://krrd.ing/blog/journelly-update/">Brandon says so too</a>).</p>
<h2>Org mode enthusiasts</h2>
<p>I got this one pretty well-covered also. I'm an Emacs org mode enthusiast myself and regularly <a href="https://xenodium.com/a-richer-journelly-org-capture-template">share my Journelly entries between my iPhone and Mac</a>. You don't need to take my word for it though. jcs is a seasoned Emacs enthusiast. <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?s=Journelly">From Irreal, he's covered Journelly pretty well</a>. While <a href="https://journelly.com/">journelly.com</a> quotes and links to posts from happy users, I've been collecting posts from different users. I should share a post with all of them too!</p>
<h2>Markdown enthusiasts</h2>
<p>Which brings me back to this post: there are a lot of Markdown users out there. While Journelly’s UX has caught the interest of some Markdown fans, many prefer to stick with their favorite format. Your interest was heard! I did say, <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-for-ios">the more requests I get, the sooner I'll get Markdown support out the door</a>, and so here we are.</p>
<p>You can now try Markdown support via TestFlight. I look forward to your feedback.</p>
