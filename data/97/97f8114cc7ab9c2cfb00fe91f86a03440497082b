<p>Ben Terris, writing for New York Magazine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fred Trump died in 1999 at age 93. He had, Trump said, a “heart
that couldn’t be stopped” with almost no health conditions to
speak of throughout his long life. “He had one problem,” Trump
said. “At a certain age, about 86, 87, he started getting, what do
they call it?” He pointed to his forehead and looked to his press
secretary for the word that escaped him.</p>

<p>“Alzheimer’s,” Leavitt said.</p>

<p>“Like an Alzheimer’s thing,” Trump said. “Well, I don’t have it.”</p>

<p>“Is it something you think about at all?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think about it at all. You know why?” he said.
“Because whatever it is, my attitude is whatever.”</p>
