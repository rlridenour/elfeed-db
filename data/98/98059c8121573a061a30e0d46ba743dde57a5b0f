The app supports reading WhatsApp messages, sending replies, sending message reactions, sharing voice messages, and more, without the need to open the app on another device. <br/>

A connected <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with the WhatsApp app installed is required to use the Apple Watch app, and it is only available to beta testers at this time. <br/>

WhatsApp has not previously offered an Apple Watch app. There's no word on when a public launch might happen. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/30/whatsapp-testing-apple-watch-app/">WhatsApp Testing Apple Watch App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-testing-apple-watch-app.2470159/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
