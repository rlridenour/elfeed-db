  <p>I hate to say it, but the Puzzmo app is not a good experience. It
is a real shame that Zach and team launched it in this state. What
makes the shame heavier is that Zach is a superb designer. I know
he works with excellent designers too. The team has fallen short
in an off-putting way.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Gruber is not a betting man.</p>

<p>I have to say, I do like having a Puzzmo app, but I don’t think the experience is that much better than the web app version.</p>
