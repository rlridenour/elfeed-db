<p>Play with work blend, keep warmish feet,<br />
Away drive trouble, slowly eat;<br />
Air pure breathe, and early rise;<br />
Beware excess, take exercise.</p>
<p>Exercise take, excess beware;<br />
Rise early and breathe pure air;<br />
Eat slowly; trouble drive away;<br />
Feet warmish keep, blend work with play.</p>
