<p>Likening the technology to a &#8220;magic bag,&#8221; he notes that it is irresistible to many students, even when they know its use would constitute cheating:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>To judge by the number of papers I read last semester that were clearly AI generated, a lot of students are enthusiastic about this latest innovation. It turns out, too, this enthusiasm is hardly dampened by, say, a clear statement in one’s syllabus prohibiting the use of AI. Or by frequent reminders of this policy, accompanied by heartfelt pleas that students author the work they submit.</em></p>
<p>Educators are always battling strong cultural forces. &#8220;Our society has always manifested strongly anti-intellectual tendencies,&#8221; he notes. And AI makes that battle even harder.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Combating such skepticism is a large part of what education is all about. The best way to get people to see why education matters is to educate them; you can’t really grasp that value from the outside. There are always students who are willing but who feel an automatic resistance to any effort to help them learn. They need, to some degree, to be dragged along. But in the process of completing the assigned coursework, some of them start to feel it. They begin to grasp that thinking well, and in an informed manner, really is different from thinking poorly and from a position of ignorance.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>That moment, when you start to understand the power of clear thinking, is crucial. The trouble with generative AI is that it short-circuits that process entirely. </em></p>
<p>Writing is a crucial part of learning, Jollimore says, and work-arounds to prevent cheating with AI are inadequate:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Writing in a classroom can never approximate the sustained concentration required to produce a carefully thought-out, polished piece done over a period of time. Being assigned such projects encourages students to work at a higher level and to flex more of their intellectual capacities. It teaches them that good writing is something you craft, not something you spit out at a moment’s notice. And it demonstrates to them that they are capable of producing something they can be proud of. Moreover, restricting students’ writing to the classroom overlooks the fact that a student’s comprehension and thinking ability will nearly always be more accurately represented by sentences they take time to mull over, to compose, and to revise than by words they whip up when confronted by an exam question.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I have said this sort of thing to students from time to time, in explaining why most of their grade—all of it, in some cases—is based on such long-term writing assignments. Such assignments have been the most powerful teaching tool in my arsenal, particularly when they are developed in stages: a first draft followed by feedback, followed by a revision, and so on. Assuming that the student puts in the effort, the paper inevitably gets better through such a process.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>But what is more important is that the </em>student <em>gets better. After all, I don’t actually need the essays. I don’t have a shortage of things to read. The essays are a means to an end, the end being the transformation of the author into an educated person. This kind of writing assignment is simply the best available instrument for bringing about this highly desirable end.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>But it works only, of course, if the students themselves write the essays.</em></p>
