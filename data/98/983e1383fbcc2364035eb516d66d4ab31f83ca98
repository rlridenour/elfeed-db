<p>Blue Origin launched its New Glenn rocket from Cape Canaveral this week, carrying two NASA spacecraft bound for Mars in a mission to study the planet&#x27;s magnetosphere; the orbiters are due to arrive in 2027. The company successfully landed the New Glenn first-stage booster on an offshore barge — its first confirmed recovery of that vehicle — a milestone for reusable rocketry outside SpaceX. The flight, New Glenn&#x27;s second, had been delayed by weather and space‑weather concerns before clearing for launch from Launch Complex 36.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RdtNp1zJhFDVZcq58SwdyxCCVEUoCVk4h5WOSSyuIAanWHxEl25Gw159ymYVor9NkUGxnqHPSoK8TJXI8sdc_Iziogbz-kKFFl5XDXTpqAkicLyfJ0uF7puiS2RgtEdA3UaZ12nDfo30mpUxlUcoJkyajyaY92mOdfj6-jV1AaH2frtgNDYiqKwLzqnoLBQlrJ5Vx3ghNsVpfZdbbr5H3MVXXni37rSxpbSlB5GbhAMIV-zCsj14sUsb2dqcbH-3w9vh2-nVzPSUOJQHFw' alt='A Blue Origin New Glenn rocket lifts off from Launch Complex 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Fla., Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>First non‑SpaceX recovery: Blue Origin&#x27;s booster recovery marks the first successful New Glenn landing and is the first such recovery by a company other than SpaceX, widening competition in reusable launch operations.</li><li>Payload identities: The twin spacecraft — often referred to as &#x27;Blue&#x27; and &#x27;Gold&#x27; in coverage — form NASA&#x27;s ESCAPADE-style science effort to examine Mars&#x27; magnetosphere during an extended cruise and orbital campaign.</li><li>Vehicle scale: New Glenn stands at roughly 98–100 metres tall, a heavy-lift rocket design that NASA and Blue Origin see as capable of carrying crew and cargo for future lunar and deep-space logistics.</li><li>Operational implications: Successful booster recovery should help Blue Origin reduce per-launch costs and support its plan to include New Glenn in future NASA and commercial missions, pending follow-up reuse campaigns.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Blue Origin (company perspective): Company coverage framed the launch and booster recovery as a major milestone for its lunar and deep-space ambitions, highlighting the flight&#x27;s role in demonstrating reusable New Glenn operations.
