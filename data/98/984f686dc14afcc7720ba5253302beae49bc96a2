Apple's first foldable iPhone will be equipped with a 7.8-inch inner display, and a 5.5-inch outer display, <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20250722-12649.html">according to Taiwanese research firm TrendForce</a>.<br/>

Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">already mentioned those same display sizes</a> for the foldable iPhone in March, meaning there are now multiple sources backing those sizes, so long as TrendForce is not simply copying what Kuo said.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> has an 8-inch inner screen, and a 6.5-inch outer screen.<br/>
<br/>
TrendForce said Apple will likely launch the foldable iPhone in the second half of 2026, so the device could debut in September of next year.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Kuo said the foldable iPhone (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/foldable-iphone-galaxy-z-fold-8-crease-free/">and Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 8</a>) will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/foldable-iphone-crease-free-samsung-display/">"crease-free" inner display</a>. He said Apple will achieve this feat by using a laser-drilled metal display plate, which can disperse the stress generated by bending.<br/>

Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">expects</a> the foldable iPhone to have two rear cameras, one front camera, and a Touch ID power button instead of Face ID.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/">TrendForce</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/22/foldable-iphone-display-sizes-rumor/">Foldable iPhone&#039;s Display Sizes Leaked</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphones-display-sizes-leaked.2462046/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
