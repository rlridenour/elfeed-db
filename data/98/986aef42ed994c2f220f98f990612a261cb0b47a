<p><a href="https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell">chatgpt-shell</a>'s README includes few org tables documenting the package's <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell#chatgpt-shell-customizations">customizable variables</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell#chatgpt-shell-commands">available commands</a>. Don't worry, this isn't really another ChatGPT post.</p>
<p>Here's an extract of the docs table:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.org">| Custom variable                       | Description                                                 |
|---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| chatgpt-shell-display-function        | Function to display the shell.                              |
| chatgpt-shell-curl-additional-options | Additional options for `curl' command.                      |
| chatgpt-shell-system-prompt           | The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. |
</code></pre>
<p>While the table docs didn't take long to build manually, they quickly became out of sync with their elisp counterparts. Not ideal, as it'll require a little more careful maintenance in the future.</p>
<p>Emacs being the self-documenting editor that it is, I figured I should be able to extract customizable variables, commands, along with their respective docs, and generate these very same org tables.</p>
<p>I had no idea how to go about this, but <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Apropos.html">apropos-variable</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Apropos.html">apropos-command</a> surely knew where to fetch the details from. A peek into <code>apropos.el</code> quickly got me on my way. Turns out <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Creating-Symbols.html#Definition-of-mapatoms">mapatoms</a> is just what I needed. It iterates over <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Creating-Symbols.html">obarray</a>, Emacs's symbol table. We can use it to extract the symbols we're after.</p>
<p>Since we're filtering symbols from <code>chatgpt-shell</code>, we can start by including only those whose <code>symbol-name</code> match &quot;^chatgpt-shell&quot;. Out of all matching, we should only keep custom variables. We can use <code>custom-variable-p</code> to check for that. This gives us all relevant variables. We can subsequently get each variable's corresponding docs using <code>(get symbol 'variable-documentation)</code> and put it into a list.</p>
<p>Now, if we pull our org babel rabbit out of our Emacs magic hat, we can use <code>:results table</code> to print the list as an org table. The source block powering this magic trick looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-org">#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results table :colnames '(&quot;Custom variable&quot; &quot;Description&quot;)
  (let ((rows))
    (mapatoms
     (lambda (symbol)
       (when (and (string-match &quot;^chatgpt-shell&quot;
                                (symbol-name symbol))
                  (custom-variable-p symbol))
         (push `(,symbol
                 ,(car
                   (split-string
                    (or (get (indirect-variable symbol)
                             'variable-documentation)
                        (get symbol 'variable-documentation)
                        &quot;&quot;)
                    &quot;\n&quot;)))
               rows))))
    rows)
#+end_src
</code></pre>
<p>And just like that… we effortlessly get our elisp docs in an org table, straight from Emacs's symbol table.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that our snippet used <code>indirect-variable</code> to resolve aliases but also limited descriptions to the first line in each docstring.</p>
<p>To build a similar table for interactive commands, we can use the following block (also including bindings).</p>
<pre><code class="language-org">#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results table :colnames '(&quot;Binding&quot; &quot;Command&quot; &quot;Description&quot;)
  (let ((rows))
    (mapatoms
     (lambda (symbol)
       (when (and (string-match &quot;^chatgpt-shell&quot;
                                (symbol-name symbol))
                  (commandp symbol))
         (push `(,(mapconcat
                   #'help--key-description-fontified
                   (where-is-internal
                    symbol shell-maker-mode-map nil nil (command-remapping symbol)) &quot;, &quot;)
                 ,symbol
                 ,(car
                   (split-string
                    (or (documentation symbol t) &quot;&quot;)
                    &quot;\n&quot;)))
               rows))))
    rows)
#+END_SRC

<p>You see? This post wasn't really about ChatGPT. Aren't you glad you stuck around? 😀</p>
