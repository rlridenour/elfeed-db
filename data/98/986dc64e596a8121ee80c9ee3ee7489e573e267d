<p>Israel says the Rafah pedestrian crossing between Gaza and Egypt will reopen on Sunday, February 1, after being largely closed for almost two years, restoring Gaza’s only border link to a country other than Israel. Israeli authorities described the step as a reopening for people’s movement rather than a broad reopening of commercial traffic. The planned reopening is being framed by Israel as part of a wider push connected to President Donald Trump’s Gaza ceasefire plan, and it is also tied to Israel’s security screening and coordination with Egypt. For many Gazans, even a limited resumption of crossing activity signals a small but meaningful opening for family reunification and medical or humanitarian-related travel—though the scope remains restricted by stated Israeli conditions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lvtB6tmYcLIBRdQFaAFgrP_0MYtBrd_cjSfks4imwzXcrQVZPmWpan7sg9zjxI1ZXSH93uSyS2fBdyzg3AC1zXc8NuZT17lH-ZiOnXWcYZJTDdw5xzR0s-KC3YXsteG5gZJaQdZMz3SNjP1dNOZyQjB31KIOGBQNw5xpwkpAoLvyZCXk1vtW6QoS7JQv3d0SJ1GwJaOz21Ajk7u2J1df_T5CacpkZMNlpXM4eIxoyyPy8_tMpdPTDbRTLJPbXNl2v6NqbXcrvp18x4SQqA' alt='People stand near the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip in Rafah, Egypt, January 27, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who can cross: Israel’s COGAT said returns from Egypt into Gaza would be permitted only for Gaza residents who left during the war and only after prior Israeli security clearance, in coordination with Egypt.</li><li>Israel’s framing: COGAT described the change as allowing “limited movement of people only,” indicating a controlled reopening rather than a full resumption of all border activity.</li><li>Strategic significance: Rafah is Gaza’s main gateway to the outside world and the only crossing that connects Gaza to a country other than Israel, making any reopening symbolically and practically important for access beyond Israeli-controlled crossings.</li><li>How closure began: Several outlets note Israel seized the Rafah crossing in May 2024 during the Gaza war, after which the crossing was shut for extended periods.</li><li>Humanitarian role: Al Jazeera notes the Rafah route has been a vital link for humanitarian supplies, and its long closure has constrained the flow of assistance.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israel (COGAT): Israel’s military coordination body says it will permit only limited pedestrian movement and require prior security clearance for eligible returnees from Egypt, coordinated with Egypt.
