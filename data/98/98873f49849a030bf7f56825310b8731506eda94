<strong>Latest Update</strong>: July 8 – <a href="#color">iPhone 17 Air to come in new light blue finish</a><br/>
<hr /><br/>
This year, Apple is expected to discontinue the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> "Plus" device in its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup to make way for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; "Air," so-called because of its ultra-thin profile.  <br/>

Below is a compilation of every rumor and leak we have registered from reputable sources thus far about Apple's new entry in its flagship smartphone lineup. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Air"?</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">About the Name</span><br><br/>
There has been some uncertainty about Apple's strategy for the new slimmer &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; model and its position in the lineup. YouTuber <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a> was <a href="https://youtu.be/8c7HWZRO_D8?feature=shared">first to suggest</a> that the device could be positioned as an "‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ Air." <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/slim-iphone-17-could-be-iphone-air/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> has since come out in agreement about the naming, which Apple could use to boost sales. <br/>
<br/>
Replacing the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; "Plus," which, like the "mini" models before it, has not sold well, the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ Air will represent a new approach in Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup, offering a device with a substantially thinner design that sits between the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ Pro. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman believes that the design of the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ Air will "just be a step toward something better" since Apple will eventually want to "squeeze the power of a Pro model into this smaller design." However, he does not expect this to occur before 2027 at the earliest.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Device Thickness Rumors</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Thinner Than &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6</span><br><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-a-thinner-iphone-in-2025">The Information</a></em>, Apple's all-new &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; model will have a "significantly thinner" design with an aluminum chassis, rather than a titanium casing like Apple's Pro models. <br/>
<br/>
There have been mixed rumors on just how thin Apple will be able to make it. Rumors have hovered around 6mm, however in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">recent report</a>, reliable Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that he expects the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ to measure in at about 5.5mm at its thinnest point. At 5.5mm, the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ Air would be the thinnest ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ to date – thinner than the 6.9mm ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 6 that came out in 2014. 5.5mm would be approximately 30% thinner than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, which measures in at 7.8mm thick, and 33% thinner than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models, which are 8.25mm thick. <br/>
<br/>

The device is said to have only a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-air-features-reported/">single speaker</a>, in the earpiece, as there is apparently not enough room for a second speaker on the bottom edge. <em>The Information</em> also claims that the device will feature a narrower <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, though this specific claim has since been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">contested</a>. Internally code-named D23, the device's redesign has been described as a major one equivalent to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Display Size</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Smaller Than Plus Model</span><br><br/>
The first details about the size of the device's display arrived courtesy of Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu, who said it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">6.6 inches</a>. Apple analyst &zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj; has since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">corroborated</a> Pu's claim. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young</a> says the device will feature a 6.55-inch display, which could be rounded up to 6.6 inches. Complicating matters, YouTuber &zwnj;Jon Prosser&zwnj; more recently claimed that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> will be equipped with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/iphone-17-air-now-rumored-to-feature-6-7-inch-display/">6.7-inch display</a>, rather than a 6.6-inch display as previously rumored. For context, the existing &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus has a 6.7-inch display. However, in response to Prosser's prediction, Young reiterated his 6.55-inch display size claim for the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
In mid-March 2025, we reported on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-air-same-size-iphone-16-pro-max/">rumor out of China</a> claiming that the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; shares the same dimensions as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> Max, with the only difference being in the thickness of the devices. Days later, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/larger-iphone-17-air-referred-to-prototype/">prototyped</a> a larger ultra-slim &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; with a 6.9-inch display, but ultimately decided not to go ahead with the device because of fears that it could be susceptible to bending. It's quite possible the China-originating rumor had its origins in Apple's canned prototype.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; could have ultra-thin bezels as could the entire &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; series, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/iphone-17-and-17-air-thinner-bezels-rumor/">according to one leaker</a>. Apple says the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max feature the thinnest bezels around the screen of any product it has ever released, so perhaps we can expect a similar sized bezel for the Air. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Always-On Display</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">ProMotion Support</span><br><br/>
Apple intends to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/promotion-standard-iphones-2025/">expand</a> ProMotion to the entire lineup in 2025, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-17-and-17-air-120hz-promotion-rumor/">including the iPhone 17 "Air,"</a> allowing all &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. This will be enabled by Apple's use of Samsung's high performance <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-air-to-use-samsung-m4-panel/">"M14" OLED display panel</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/120-hz-14-holepunch-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-806922" /><br/>
Previously, only "Pro" models in Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup used the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> OLED panel, which is why they have exclusively supported ProMotion. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Air" to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Camera Redesign</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Relocated Lens</span><br><br/>
<em>The Information</em> claimed that the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will have cameras in locations we haven't seen before on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. According to a May report, the rear cameras could be moved to the "top center" of the device. Some Android phones like Google's Pixel 9 Pro have rear cameras in a top-center position, or in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/alleged-iphone-17-air-shell/">runway-style horizontal bar</a>, but Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; camera system has occupied the top-left corner ever since the 2007 model. <br/>
<br/>
Adding to the intrigue, Apple analyst &zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj; has claimed that the device will have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">only one camera</a>, as opposed to two or three.<br/>
<br/>

Since then, YouTube channel Front Page Tech has revealed the alleged design of the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;. The renders show an all-new camera bar across the top of the device's rear shell. On the left side of the bar is a single rear camera, and on the right side there is a microphone and an LED camera flash.<br/>
<br/>
Most recently, a CAD render of all the devices in Apple's upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup has been shared online by leaker Majin Bu, specifically showing the allegedly different rear camera system designs of the standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, including the all-new ultra-thin &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;. The CAD shows the described horizontal camera bar design accommodating the single camera lens.<br/>

"The appearance is basically like this," commented Digital Chat Station in reference to the image.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">More Durable Screen</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Anti-Reflective Coating</span><br><br/>
All &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">Chinese Weibo leaker Instant Digital</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The outer glass on the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; series is said to have a "super-hard anti-reflective layer" that is "more scratch-resistant." It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Improved Front Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Better Selfies</span><br><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the entire &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup features the same hardware. <br/>
<br/>
The upgraded resolution on the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">More RAM</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;"><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></span><br><br/>
Haitong analyst Jeff Pu has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">claimed</a> the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will feature 8GB of RAM, compared to 6GB of RAM on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. However, more recently, &zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj; has said that all &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models will be equipped with 12GB of RAM, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-12gb-ram-rumor/">including the Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>

It's worth noting that all &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models (including the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>) are fitted with 8GB of RAM – a hardware requirement of on-device &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; – so it's almost a surety that the slim device will also have at least this amount of memory.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Next-Gen Processor</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Better Performance</span><br><br/>
According to <em>The Information</em> and Haitong International analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/">Jeff Pu</a>, the device will be equipped with Apple's A19 chip, which is likely to be based on an optimized version of TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process, possibly N3P or N3X. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/3nm-apple-silicon-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1810" height="1018" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804957" /><br/>
In contrast, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max are expected to include an A19 Pro chip. Compared to earlier versions of &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; chips, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density. <br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Battery Life</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Questions Remain</span><br><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> and industry analyst &zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will utilize the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">C1 modem</a> that recently debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>. The C1 is Apple's first custom-designed modem chip, and should bring significant advantages to the upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/apple-c1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990815" /><br/>
The C1 is the most power-efficient modem ever featured in an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and promises very good battery life even within the frame of the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;'s ultra-thin design. According to Apple's tech specs, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; offers up to 26 hours of battery life for video playback, compared to up to 22 hours for the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. This efficiency comes from Apple's complete control over the modem's design and integration with its custom silicon. The only minor drawback to the C1 is that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/apples-c1-modem-iphone-17-air-lack-mmwave/">does not support mmWave</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; could become the first Apple smartphone to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/iphone-17-air-advanced-silicon-battery/">adopt advanced battery technology</a>, with Japanese supplier TDK preparing to ship its new generation of silicon-anode batteries by the end of June. One leaker has claimed the device's battery capacity is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/iphone-17-air-battery-capacity-revealed/">2,800mAh</a>, which wouldn't be far off the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, which has a 2,815mAh battery. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> reporter &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; has said the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will provide battery life that is "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/">on par with current iPhones</a>." However, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">report</a> by <em>The Information</em>, the device will have "worse" battery life compared to previous &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, which could influence Apple's decision to release a battery case as an optional accessory for the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Camera Control</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Photography Button</span><br><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will feature the same Camera Control button that &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models have on the right-side of the device, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The button provides quick access to the camera and related settings, but some people find the button's touch sensitivity finicky, and many users disable it.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Wi-Fi 7 Support</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">For Enhanced Connectivity</span><br><br/>
Apple will use its own custom-designed Wi-Fi chip in all upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models, including the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/kuo-iphone-17-models-apple-designed-wi-fi-7-chip/">industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo said the switch to in-house Wi-Fi chips will "enhance connectivity across Apple devices" while also giving Apple a cost reduction. <br/>
<br/>

Apple's custom wireless chip will support Wi-Fi 7 specification, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-17-air-wifi-7-rumor/">Jeff Pu</a>, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. All current &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models are equipped with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip supplied by Broadcom.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a></span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">For Wireless Charging</span><br><br/>
Despite the thinness of the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;, the device will support &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/iphone-17-air-magsafe-expected/">reliable Chinese leaker</a>. The leaker said that all four &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models this year will support &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; for magnetic wireless charging and magnetic accessories. Apple dropped &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; from the low-end &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, which left some uncertainty that the technology would feature in the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, Apple appears to be moving to the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/iphone-17-support-50w-magsafe-wireless-charging/">regulatory filings</a>, which increases the likelihood that the upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models will support the new charging standard. Qi 2.2 is technically capable of up to 50W charging output – but that doesn't guarantee Apple's iPhones will charge at the maximum 50W. In addition to faster charging, Qi 2.2 offers improved magnetic alignment and charging efficiency compared to its predecessor. The standard also features backward compatibility with older Qi chargers.<br/>

The slim device will lack a physical SIM card slot, and instead rely entirely on digital eSIM technology, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">according to Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. In the U.S., all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models lack a physical SIM card tray already, but all iPhones sold in other countries still have one for now. <br/>
<br/>
The lack of a SIM card slot in all forthcoming &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models worldwide has been previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/iphone-17-esim-only-in-more-countries-report/">reported</a>, but it is not clear how the devices would be sold in the Chinese market, where the use of eSIMs in smartphones is not currently authorized.<br/>

A new light blue finish is rumored to be the signature color of the all-new ultra-thin &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;, according to a leak from Asia. The tip, shared by Weibo leaker "Fixed Focus Digital," suggests that this blue shade will be central to Apple's marketing for the new device, which will replace the Plus model in Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup. Described as significantly lighter than any previous blue Apple has released, the color may appear almost white in low-light conditions.<br/>

The finish is said to echo Apple's past use of lighter tones, particularly the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro's "Sierra Blue." That color marked a shift toward more subtle, pastel-like shades – metallic and icy, it shifted between blue and light gray depending on the lighting. Apple continued this trend with the softer, pastel finishes introduced in the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup.<br/>

<em>The Information</em> reported that the slimmer &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; could have a higher price tag than the Pro Max model, which currently starts at &#36;1,199, despite suggestions that it will not be as feature-rich as Apple's top-tier Max. <br/>

However, Haitong International analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/">Jeff Pu</a> believes the device will be a mid-tier &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that replaces the Plus model. Additionally, a report out of China has claimed that the ultra-thin &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;'s price will be similar to that of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, which starts at &#36;899 in the United States. More recently, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; said he was told that the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-17-air-price-battery-life-more/">may start at roughly &#36;899</a> in the US, while a newer report by <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> has suggested that all &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models may have higher prices than usual because of the impact of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-considering-price-increases-iphone-17/">U.S. import tariffs on foreign goods</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/iphone-17-air-design-specs-rumors-so-far/">iPhone 17 Air Design, Specs, and More: All the Rumors So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-design-specs-and-more-all-the-rumors-so-far.2461240/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
