Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/11/apple-launches-iphone-pocket-accessory/">announced</a> the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pocket, a 3D-knitted limited edition accessory made in collaboration with Japanese fashion house ISSEY MIYAKE. The accessory is like a stretchy pocket, similar to an iPod Sock, but elongated to form a strap made of a ribbed, elastic textile. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pocket comes in two versions. There's a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/hs8q2zm/a/iphone-pocket-by-issey-miyake-short-mandarin">short strap design</a> available in eight colors for &#36;149.95, and a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/hs8k2zm/a/iphone-pocket-by-issey-miyake-long-black">long strap design</a> in three colors for &#36;229.95. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pocket can be used in a variety of ways – handheld, tied onto bags, or worn directly on the body. The limited-edition release is now available on Apple's online store and at select flagship <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> locations worldwide, although it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/14/iphone-pocket-already-selling-out/">rapidly selling out</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/09/future-of-apple-fitness-under-review/">recently reported</a> that the future of Apple Fitness+ is "under review." The service apparently suffers from high churn and little revenue, remaining one of the company's "weakest digital offerings." <br/>
<br/>
As a result, Fitness+ is now said to be in the process of receiving new management, with Apple health vice president Sumbul Desai taking control of the service. The health division, now including Apple Fitness+, will report directly to services chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a>. The reorganization is likely to lead to added pressure to improve the service.<br/>
<br/>
In other news, it emerged this week that Apple's second-generation &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/10/next-generation-iphone-air-delayed/">delayed</a> on account of the device's low sales, pushed back from the original target launch of fall 2026. Since the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; launched in September, there have been a multitude of reports of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/iphone-air-supply-chain-cuts/">poor sales and significant production cuts</a>. Apple has responded by scaling back shipments and winding down the supply chain, with all production expected to cease by the end of this month.<br/>
<br/>
Apple now plans to introduce a more substantially redesigned &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; 2 model in the future, perhaps alongside the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18e and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> in the spring of 2027. The new device could feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/06/2026-iphone-air-dual-lens-camera/">additional rear camera</a> with an ultra-wide lens, vapor-chamber cooling, reduced weight, a larger battery, and a new chip. <br/>
