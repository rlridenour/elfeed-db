<p>Italian officials are seeking clarity and some are voicing opposition after the U.S. confirmed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) will help support security planning for the U.S. delegation at the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics, which begin February 6. ICE says its HSI unit will support the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service and work with Italy to vet and reduce risks from transnational criminal organizations, while all security operations remain under Italian authority and the agents will not conduct immigration enforcement in Italy. Milan’s mayor Giuseppe Sala publicly said ICE is “not welcome,” linking his criticism to recent deadly incidents involving ICE agents in Minnesota that have fueled international attention and concern. The dispute has become a diplomatic and domestic political flashpoint in Italy just ahead of the Games, even as both sides emphasize that host-nation security command remains in Italian hands.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/IvIZfWwk8p0sn3BIREVAJ50BDNDVS2xIrA9JBbpkwpPnHiUXzoY_kfwbYbeNrsTjppnSZeE9s2Hxt_yL6brTaFASjzO1j36BNlb7W62vYr0Z' alt='Olympic rings covered in snow ahead of the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>What HSI is: HSI is the investigative branch within ICE that focuses on cross-border threats such as illicit movement of people, goods, money, contraband, weapons and sensitive technology, and ICE drew a distinction between HSI and its deportation-focused unit, Enforcement and Removal Operations.</li><li>Italy’s clarification: Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani argued the U.S. personnel involved are not the same type of agents seen in Minneapolis and said Italy’s government was working to clarify the plan as political backlash grew.</li><li>Diplomatic meetings: Politico reported U.S. ambassador Tilman Fertitta was scheduled to meet Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi to clarify Olympic security arrangements.</li><li>Local politics: The controversy widened after Lombardy regional president Attilio Fontana initially gave a mistaken impression about ICE’s role being limited to protecting top U.S. officials attending the opening ceremony.</li><li>US delegation context: U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected at the Feb. 6 opening ceremony at Milan’s San Siro stadium, increasing the size and sensitivity of the U.S. security footprint.</li></ul><blockquote>At the Olympics, ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is supporting the US Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service and the host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations.
