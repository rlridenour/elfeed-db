Apple and MP Materials will build out the Texas factory with a series of neodymium magnet manufacturing lines specifically designed for Apple products, the company said. Today, nearly all magnets across Apple devices are made with 100% recycled rare earth elements, including in the Taptic Engine in the iPhone 11 and newer.<br/>
<br/>
The two companies will also work together to build a rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California, according to the announcement.<br/>
<br/>
"American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we're proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy," said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a statement. "Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States."<br/>

Apple said its commitment will support dozens of new U.S. jobs in manufacturing and R&D.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-environment/">Apple Environment</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/apple-500m-commitment-to-american-magnets/">Apple Announces &#36;500 Million Commitment to Buying American Magnets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-500-million-commitment-to-buying-american-magnets.2461587/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
