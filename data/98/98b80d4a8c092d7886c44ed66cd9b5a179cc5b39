I just discovered a useful trick over at <a href="https://codelearn.me">Ruslan&rsquo;s Tech Blog</a>. It&rsquo;s about <a href="https://codelearn.me/2025/11/05/find-file-at-point-trick.html">finding the file at point</a>. Ruslan does this a lot. I, on the other hand, hardly every do it but I <i>have</i> gotten used to typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd> to follow a link in an Org buffer. Despite using the goto-addr package, this doesn&rsquo;t work reliably everywhere.

Ruslan was also bothered by the difficulty of opening a file at point—although his normal usage didn&rsquo;t involve Org. Like many of us, he thought he&rsquo;d just write a quick command to do what he wanted but before embarking on that, he read the documentation for find-file and discovered that the functionality he wanted was already there.

If the point is on a file path, you can invoke <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <code>find-file-at-point</code> but that&rsquo;s a lot of typing. It&rsquo;s a bit less typing if you use its <code>ffap</code> alias but perhaps still too much. Instead, you can just type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> as usual and then <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd> to follow the link at point. It&rsquo;s a nice solution because you do what you always do when you want to open a file and then type <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd> instead of a file path to open the file at point. Best of all, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything to enable this. It&rsquo;s the default Emacs behavior.</p>
