         <p>In this video I provide an overview of how to customise the Emacs mode
line colours. I show the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set-face-attribute</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">custom-set-faces</code>
functions and explain what the difference between them is in terms of
effect. I also discuss how to get a list of faces and supported
colours, as well as some parts that are specific to my themes (the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes</code> in this case, though my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">standard-themes</code> have a similar design).</p>

<p>Also watch how to write a custom mode line:
