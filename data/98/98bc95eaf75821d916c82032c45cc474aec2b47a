The event is set to include WWDC-related special activities like the keynote viewing, the Platforms State of the Union, Apple Design Awards, &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; tours, and a dinner. Developers and students will also have opportunities to interface with Apple engineers and experts.<br/>

Current Apple Developer Program members, Apple Developer Enterprise Program members, Apple Entrepreneur Camp alumni, and Swift Student Challenge winners from 2023 to 2025 were eligible to apply, with attendees chosen by random selection.<br/>

There is no cost to attend the &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; special event, but Apple does not cover transportation or lodging. Out-of-state attendees will need to purchase airfare, hotel accommodations, and transportation to &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj;.<br/>
