<p>Britain&#x27;s Labour government, led by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, announced a sweeping overhaul of the country&#x27;s asylum laws in mid-November 2025 that would make refugee status temporary, remove automatic benefits for asylum seekers and allow authorities to use high-value assets to help fund accommodation. The proposals would also permit deportation if conditions in an applicant&#x27;s home country improve and could delay permanent settlement for people who arrived on small boats for up to 20 years, officials said, framing the changes as a way to cut irregular migration and reduce the so-called &quot;pull factor&quot;. Ministers say the reforms aim to restore control over borders amid rising public concern about migration, while critics inside and outside Labour warn the measures will harm refugees and increase community tensions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uMXxXlIcMJjbv8rNOKqn4Pxl_S_GjbC2nER3Rh4iCE7g80sSZYa2WxnH7_UqZW1N2dZBTSQnoXJacDL0LsUl7KRiyge5WhmOPesEDppHckixxYMC6QJUxa0NksB4AOjR1K-4kFWDPCv7yMAkqaaqiWBmw1qS19qzFccpUf3Mrcy7WUyD2ZbmuVrqM1OtNJELmePOwF4gI4Z7LOlUhXP9XSi1atKamF2eWJN74AlavPs9u38O3yuQJbLqhn4b9hsxd-EuzR6biOEQhEaybg' alt='Migrants leave the coast of northern France on an inflatable dinghy in an attempt to cross the English Channel; tens of thousands applied for asylum in the UK this year [theglobeandmail.com#1].' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Denmark comparison: The government says it drew lessons from Denmark, where asylum claims fell to a 40-year low last year, a result cited by critics and supporters as evidence the approach reduces arrivals.</li><li>Internal backlash: Veteran Labour peer Alf Dubs, a former child refugee, described the proposals as a &#x27;shabby&#x27; move and warned they would worsen community tensions by targeting families and children.</li><li>Deportation ramp-up: Officials signalled plans to increase removals, including deportations of families, as part of a broader push to speed up returns and deter irregular crossings.</li><li>Political context: Ministers framed the overhaul as a response to rising anti-immigration sentiment and the growing popularity of Reform UK, arguing stronger rules are needed to counter the hard right.</li></ul><blockquote>To use children as a weapon - Alf Dubs</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Shabana Mahmood, home secretary: Mahmood says the reforms will restore order and control at UK borders and reduce the &#x27;pull factor&#x27; for migrants.
