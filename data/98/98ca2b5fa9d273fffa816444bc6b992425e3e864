<p>The UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed that a drone strike earlier this year damaged the steel confinement structure built to contain radioactive material at Ukraine’s Chernobyl (Chornobyl) nuclear plant, meaning it no longer fully performs its main safety function of blocking radiation from the destroyed reactor 4 unit. Inspectors visiting the site in late November found that a February impact had degraded parts of the huge arch-shaped shelter completed in 2019, which was designed to enable the safe dismantling of the 1986 disaster’s remains. Ukraine says the strike was carried out by a Russian drone as part of the wider conflict, while Moscow denies targeting the plant. Despite the structural concerns, the IAEA reports that radiation levels around the site remain within normal ranges for the area, and emergency repairs have already been carried out while a plan for more extensive long‑term work is developed.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/t5QkvqhRVNeAYBu2fIfknJs3c5SsrwHSVrfvYCvqhzhxs0ce2zfmaqoloW2UUyIjsp64BFlOAAqghBr1ujYrBJRYYBoZG7On4MP_o6wnf4MKMDIKzadsDrClCUgo9jh7TC4xNdQ-R0gu1k2e7mGgxszWxs1TcapBdh4MUsg_ePgikBQN37NeNnNmVl1aq5lgqm7GXjgKyp-qqjgo8_L-rYI' alt='View of the steel arch confinement structure over Chernobyl’s destroyed reactor 4 in Ukraine.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Inspection timing: IAEA experts identified the confinement damage during a mission to Chernobyl in late November, several months after the February drone incident and as part of their ongoing monitoring of nuclear sites in wartime Ukraine.</li><li>Interim repairs: Ukrainian authorities have already performed short‑term fixes on the affected area of the shelter, though the agency says a more extensive programme will be needed to fully restore its protective role over the destroyed reactor.</li><li>Conflict context: The confinement structure was struck three years into Russia’s full‑scale invasion of Ukraine, highlighting how fighting has increasingly come close to or directly affected several of the country’s nuclear facilities.</li><li>Design purpose: The arch was built adjacent to the crumbling concrete sarcophagus and slid into place on rails so engineers could eventually dismantle the old structure and remaining reactor debris in a controlled way.</li><li>Cost and funding: The new safe confinement cost about €1.5 billion and was financed through a Europe‑led initiative involving more than 40 donor countries and institutions, reflecting broad international investment in safely securing the Chernobyl site.</li></ul><blockquote>Our main message is that this kind of attack should not happen. - Rafael Mariano Grossi</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine: Ukrainian officials say the February blast at Chernobyl was caused by a Russian drone strike, framing the incident as evidence that Moscow is willing to endanger nuclear infrastructure during its military campaign.
