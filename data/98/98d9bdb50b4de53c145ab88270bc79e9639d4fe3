<p>Cuba is moving to ration aviation fuel after warning airlines that jet fuel won’t be available for refuelling at nine airports — including José Martí International Airport in Havana — starting Tuesday and lasting until March 11. The shortage is already disrupting travel: Air Canada said it is suspending flights to Cuba and is deploying empty aircraft to bring home stranded passengers. Several outlets tie the crunch to stepped-up U.S. pressure under President Trump that aims to restrict oil shipments to the island — pressure Cuba and others describe as a blockade; Russia called Cuba’s fuel situation “critical” and accused the U.S. of trying to “suffocate” Cuba’s economy. The New York Times and Semafor also report the policy has put Mexico in a difficult spot, as Washington’s threats toward Cuba’s oil suppliers have strained Mexico’s long-standing ties with Havana. For travelers, the immediate impact is clear — especially during peak tourist season — but Cuba has given carriers notice about the refuelling limits, and Air Canada’s repatriation flights are meant to cut down the number of people left in limbo.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SSHOMzDwvb9I5DlvBcVIhpyHJEelSvDTOCbGLHZB7EuvTSzS2yUGprlhDzn-J3kqx5As6h_F4WWlvt617317NEBZDG5ox1clCgRYM3wlBUmeTexsgRQ9g2T6ZDdIJbeAPAjHy4JONB-ym8Qr-j4D8TYL5c7cvPVY3eU_vaxncVEQf-vMhYA-xEJ5XKPN0g_Umq2UYDCP35eK8Z3PI_R86jpazf34ebj_moGp5XaqK9Fp8-ZgNgzlPiF5WIc75oE4SyA' alt='A view at a Cuban airport amid reports of dwindling fuel supplies.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Emergency curbs: Cuba is taking broader emergency steps to conserve fuel, including closing universities, shortening school hours and the work week, and cutting public transport.</li><li>Tourism strain: Visitors are being relocated to higher-category hotels as the energy crisis disrupts normal tourism logistics and airlines reduce service.</li><li>Supply squeeze: Reuters reported Cuba told airlines it was close to exhausting jet-fuel stocks as oil flows tightened; Russia called the situation “critical” and said it would oppose any military intervention while backing Cuba and Venezuela.</li><li>Mexico dilemma: Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum criticized the U.S. for “choking off” Cuba and, according to Semafor, is trying to balance U.S. warnings with domestic pressure to maintain Mexico’s long-standing ties with Havana.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Cuban aviation authorities: Cuba published notices warning that jet fuel won’t be available for refuelling at nine airports, including Havana’s José Martí International Airport, from Tuesday through March 11.
