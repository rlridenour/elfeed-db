<p>I don’t use the web interface to <a href="https://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>, my moribund-but-works-just-great CMS, very often. But I was using it today and noticed something odd. Next to the small-text metadata that says I’ve written 35,086 entries in total, it said I had one draft. One. I don’t use the drafts feature in Movable Type — my drafts are stored locally as text files in BBEdit or unpublished posts in MarsEdit. I didn’t recall <em>ever</em> saving a draft in Movable Type, but, I thought to myself, I probably did it from my phone — which is the one device where I do publish and edit posts through the MT web interface because (to my knowledge) there’s no equivalent of MarsEdit for iOS.</p>

<p>It was a Linked List post pointing to <a href="https://lefsetz.com/wordpress/2014/05/29/beats-deal/">Bob Lefsetz’s reaction</a> to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2014/05/28Apple-to-Acquire-Beats-Music-Beats-Electronics/">then-new Beats acquisition by Apple</a> for $3 billion, which was considered a lot of money for an acquisition at the time. The blockquote wasn’t fully Markdown-formatted yet — which is sort of tedious for me on the phone, but a single keyboard shortcut in either BBEdit or MarsEdit on my Mac. That’s probably why I left it as a draft. So, just now, I finished the formatting, and changed it from draft to published. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/01/lefsetz">Voila</a> — a post I wrote on 1 June 2014 that hadn’t been published until a few minutes ago. I suspect many of you will think Lefsetz’s 2014 remarks on Tim Cook ring more true today than they did then. Others (I’m more in this camp) look at Lefsetz’s 2014 remarks as more than a little absurd — the only mark Jimmy Iovine left at Apple was the record for being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p8AsQhaVKI&amp;t=6480s">the least prepared executive ever to appear on stage in a keynote</a>. He was like Biden at the debate up there.</p>

<p>Lending strong credence to my theory that this forgotten draft was created on my phone is that 1 June 2014 was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2014/06/wwdc_2014_prelude">the Sunday before WWDC 2014</a>, when I’d have been travelling, and thus using my phone for posting. Funny coincidence that I happened to notice it today, on the cusp of WWDC 2025.</p>
