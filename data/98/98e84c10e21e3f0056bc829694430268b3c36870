"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that [they] also have Android and Chrome," wrote Musk, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2010785742427979894">in a post on X</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Musk serves as CEO of xAI, the company behind Gemini competitor Grok.<br/>

It is unlikely that Apple or Google will publicly respond to Musk's comment, but we will update this story if the companies have anything to say.<br/>

In case you missed it, Apple and Google today jointly announced that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-future-apple-intelligence-features/">Gemini will help power future Apple Intelligence features</a>, including a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-next-generation-siri/">more personalized version of Siri</a> that is set to launch this year. Apple has yet to announce exactly when the revamped Siri will launch, but it is reportedly set to arrive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/">as part of iOS 26.4</a> in March or April.<br/>
<br/>
xAI <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/25/elon-musk-apple-lawsuit-grok-x/">filed a lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI</a> last year, accusing the two companies of conspiring to "ensure their continued dominance" in the AI market.<br/>
