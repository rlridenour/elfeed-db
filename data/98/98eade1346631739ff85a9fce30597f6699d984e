<p>So, soap. No, I&rsquo;m not talking about an Emacs package (though, of course, <a href="https://github.com/alex-hhh/emacs-soap-client">it exists</a>) or some fancy IT tool, but actual soap - the kind you use in the shower.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a search for a good soap for years. I&rsquo;ve found a couple that I like more and a few like less, but so far I don&rsquo;t have one. Maybe it&rsquo;s because different soaps are good for different things: in my case, I use one soap for my face and scalp (I&rsquo;m a bald dude) and another for everything else.</p>
<p>I prefer gentler soaps that smell &ldquo;manly.&rdquo; I usually stay away from all the man-woman branding stuff as much as I can, but generally speaking, I prefer the &ldquo;manly&rdquo; scents over the feminine ones. If I had to point toward a scent I like, I&rsquo;d point to lavender (which I also like in my Earl Grey, which makes it in a London Fog latte, one of my favorites, but I digress).</p>
<p>My current go-to is Everyone (for everybody) soap, but it&rsquo;s mostly autopilot. At the moment I&rsquo;m actually using some of the generic Dove men&rsquo;s soaps, before I try something else. My neighborhood pharmacy carries a few different brands, so I have more experimentation to do.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that I use a different soap for my face and scalp, and for that, I usually use CeraVe stuff. At some point in the past, I got their face lotion, liked it, and stayed with it - and from there I continued with their soaps. I&rsquo;ve read in a couple of places that shampoos are good for the scalp (that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re meant for), and I use them now and then, but nothing really sticks.</p>
<p>Another word about body soaps: I&rsquo;m not sure if I prefer liquid in one of those plastic bottles or a bar. The liquid is convenient, but I have to keep getting more. A bar is usually more concentrated (and can have a stronger scent), and I like that I can keep it in one hand, or just scrape some against a body brush for rough skin, like on the feet - but then you have one hand, and besides it always slides away and fall as if it has it obays its own gravity rules. Weird.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s where I am with soap. What about you? Would you mind sharing?</p>
