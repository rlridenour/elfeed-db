<p>Brazil, as host of COP30 in Belém, published a first draft of a multi-issue political package and is pressing negotiators to reach decisions on contentious topics ahead of schedule, including pathways to phase down fossil fuels, climate finance and improved transparency. The nine-page &quot;Global Mutirão&quot; draft lays out a range of options on fossil fuels, trade measures, and whether national climate pledges should be assessed more frequently, reflecting sharp divisions between a coalition pushing for a roadmap and oil-producing countries opposing such language. COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago set a midweek target for decisions, urging countries to work together quickly to finalise the Belem Political Package.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/_METbctWMT8ImOGdFJ0sHFi_XGXpUR4QVW1_XLW5RaJ2Ze5tzi3rIr8Iut52UaYNKD6-Im72ZxoJcA3ojWz7pUBPK-zQo2JOAA8xf3ajIVem' alt='Main entrance of the COP30 UN Climate Change Conference building at night in Belém, Pará State, Brazil on Nov. 7. — AFP' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Draft options: The draft offers concrete procedural choices — an optional workshop on low-carbon solutions, a high-level ministerial roundtable, or leaving the issue out — illustrating negotiators&#x27; attempt to bridge opposing blocs.</li><li>Frequency of reviews: One proposal in the Global Mutirão would shift assessments of national climate pledges from every five years to annually, aiming for more frequent tracking of global progress.</li><li>Host&#x27;s diplomacy: Brazil&#x27;s COP30 presidency recruited about 80 nations to back a push to &#x27;wean the world off fossil fuels,&#x27; signaling active coalition-building by the host delegation.</li><li>Finance focus: Negotiators are discussing specifics on how to operationalise previously pledged climate finance — including reference to $300 billion in support — rather than leaving funding language vague.</li></ul><blockquote>This COP reminds me of Paris very much.
