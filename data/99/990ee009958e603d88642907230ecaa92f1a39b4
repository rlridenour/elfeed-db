  <p>Apple shares rose 4% on Monday as a new report showed iPhone 17
sales off to a strong start in the U.S. and China.</p>

<p>The iPhone 17 series, which dropped in September, has outsold the
iPhone 16 series by 14% in the U.S. and China within its first 10
days of availability, according to <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/iPhone-17-Far-Outpaces-iPhone-16-Sales-in-China-and-US-During-First-10-Days-of-Availability">data from Counterpoint
Research</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because a research firm claims iPhone 17 sales are up 14 percent doesn’t mean they <em>are</em> up 14 percent. These are estimates, not hard numbers from Apple — and Apple doesn’t share actual sales numbers with anyone. <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/251020/p2#a251020p2">Some headlines</a> get this right, but most don’t.</p>
