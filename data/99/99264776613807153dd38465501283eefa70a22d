<p>The Financial Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple plans to shift the assembly of all US-sold iPhones to India
as soon as next year, according to people familiar with the
matter, as President Donald Trump’s trade war forces the tech
giant to pivot away from China.</p>

<p>The push builds on Apple’s strategy to diversify its supply chain
but goes further and faster than investors appreciate, with a goal
to source from India the entirety of the more than 60mn iPhones
sold annually in the US by the end of 2026.</p>

<p>The target would mean doubling the iPhone output in India, after
almost two decades in which Apple spent heavily in China to create
a world-beating production line that powered its rise into a $3tn
tech giant.</p>
