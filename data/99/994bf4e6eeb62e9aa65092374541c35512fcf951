</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A #poem of storms arriving and passing.
</p>
        <p>In <time datetime="2025-04" title="2025-04">April</time> and <time datetime="2025-05" title="2025-05">May</time> storms have thundered across Southwest Michigan.  Winds have
torn limbs from trees, casting them to the ground as if shaking from a tantrum.
I started this poem after the first of those storms, but chose, during a calm
day to complete it.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>We hear your coming     | Breath drawing in<br />
As rolling stones       | Holding present fury<br />
Eyes flashing turquoise | Moments later<br />
                   You are here<br />
<br />
Trees swaying to the symphony<br />
Played for all senses<br />
<br />
Howling<br />
Crashing<br />
Drumming<br />
Raising<br />
Dashing<br />
Lifting<br />
<br />
Eternity bound in hell’s maelstrom<br />
There is no shelter<br />
Only your rage<br />
<br />
Sparking<br />
Spewing<br />
Spitting<br />
Rolling<br />
<br />
We cower and wait<br />
for the slowing…<br />
<br />
        stilling…<br />
<br />
        passing…<br />
<br />
Flickers now fading<br />
Drums now receding<br />
Beauty in your wake.<br /></p>
