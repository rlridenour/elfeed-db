<li>There are a host of free Markdown based text editors available on macOS. They are indistinguishable from one another. <a href="https://panwriter.com/" target="_blank">PanWriter</a> is different from the others. It is focused on integration with <a href="https://pandoc.org/" target="_blank">Pandoc</a>. Which means that it concentrates on your ability to export your Markdown document to any format Pandoc supports. Pandoc is versatile and PanWriter is integrated with it. Great solution if export formats are important to you.</li>
