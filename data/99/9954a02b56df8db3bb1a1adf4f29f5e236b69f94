<p>My Penguin Classics copy of Mark Twain’s <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> sits alone atop an overfull shelf. There is a bookmark on page 204, exactly halfway through, torn from an in-flight duty-free catalog—whiskey and fancy pens. It tells me “hey, you forgot to finish this, you [various obscenities].” And I shrug. What can I say? I went to grad school, where I learned to read ten books at once and never finish one. Good thing Mark Twain didn’t write that way, or we might not have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/245"><i>Life on the Mississippi</i></a>.</p>
<p>Twain was a diligent and conscientious writer with a memory like a bear trap, or at least that’s what he wanted us to think. But somewhere in his reminiscence he may have been confused. Twain wrote <a href="https://circadianoesis.blogspot.com/2006/03/tom-sawyer-was-not-first-typewritten.html">in his 1904 autobiography that his first novel written on a typewriter—</a>the first typewritten novel at all—was <i>Tom Sawyer.</i></p>

<p>Was this so? Twain purchased his first typewriter (which probably looked like the <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object/nmah_850542">Sholes and Glidden seen here</a>) in 1874 for $125. In 1875, he writes in a letter to the Remington company that he is no longer using his typewriter; it corrupts his morals because it makes him want to swear. He gives the infernal machine away, twice. It returns to him each time.</p>
<p>The year after Twain’s moral trouble with his Remington, <i>Tom Sawyer</i> is published from handwritten manuscript, not typed. Then, seven years later, <i>Life on the Mississippi</i> (1883) comes to the publisher in typescript. Twain did not type it himself—he had presumably renounced the act—but he dictated the memoir to a typist from a handwritten draft. Now, I can hear you quibbling… &nbsp;<i>Life on the Mississippi</i> isn’t a novel at all! Well, okay, fair enough. Let’s just say it’s the first typewritten <i>book</i> and call it a day, eh? Go read this excellent <i><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/04/09/the-typing-life?currentPage=all">New Yorker piece</a></i> on the early life of the typewriter and leave me alone. I’ve got a book to finish.</p>
