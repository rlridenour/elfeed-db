Support for Apple Pay's Express Mode has been added to Edinburgh city's <a href="https://edinburghtrams.com/tap-tap">tap-on, tap-off tram network</a> and <a href="https://support.lothianbuses.com/hc/en-gb/articles/31195986486301-How-do-I-use-Express-Mode-for-Apple-Pay">Lothian bus services</a> in Scotland, enabling passengers to pay for travel without unlocking their iPhone or Apple Watch.<br/>

The new functionality went live a couple of weeks ago, and it comes after a similar rollout in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/20/manchester-gets-support-for-express-mode/">August</a> for Greater Manchester, the first time a UK integrated public transport system has implemented Express Mode outside London.  <br/>
<br/>
Apart from allowing users to pay for rides without having to wake or unlock their iPhone, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-pay/transport/">Express Mode</a> also bypasses the need to authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. Users simply need to hold their ‌iPhone‌ or Apple Watch near the contactless payment reader until a checkmark appears on the display.<br/>
<br/>
In the Apple Wallet app, users can set a debit or credit card as their default transit option under "Express Travel Settings." When Express Mode is turned on, they only need to hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near a transit reader to pay – no Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode required.<br/>

For most people, the card already set as their default payment method in Wallet will automatically be used for Express Mode, but this can be changed anytime in Settings.<br/>
<br/>
Express Mode is available in major cities worldwide, including London, New York, Beijing, Tokyo, and Sydney.<br/>
