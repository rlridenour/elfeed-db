<p>India and the European Union announced they have concluded and signed a long-negotiated free trade agreement, billed by EU leaders as the “mother of all trade deals,” after roughly two decades of talks. The pact aims to sharply reduce tariffs across many sectors and create a vast combined market, while also deepening strategic ties between New Delhi and Brussels. Multiple outlets say the timing reflects a desire by both sides to diversify partnerships amid U.S. tariff pressure and a more protectionist global trade environment under President Trump. For businesses and consumers, supporters present it as a confidence-boosting step toward steadier rules and broader choice in a choppy world economy.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/mFlFscpgFb4dBqureQvAWTF_52HU5OJ6gV2x_ZC-rYikhrMXeY5VOCYDa7zwpxFRw_A8E5_vpG7PL8FxbkWQ9DNixC1U7zaLNzkTed1OP1VBjfWwWdL0oXEb_NXQsOwsWSDHwFOxFJL0Z2PWrybfFnR-6AuDpt1YhruHUnlvSQ' alt='Officials mark the India-EU free trade agreement announcement.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tariff phase-downs: EU statements and related reporting say India will cut or eliminate duties on 96.6% of EU goods exports, including steep reductions on cars and alcoholic beverages over time.</li><li>EU-side cuts: India’s trade ministry said the EU will cut tariffs on 99.5% of goods traded over seven years, with zero tariffs planned for Indian marine goods, leather and textiles, chemicals, rubber, base metals, and gems and jewellery.</li><li>Carbon linkage: An Indian official said the EU did not grant India specific exemptions from its carbon rules, but agreed that any future CBAM relaxations it gives other countries would automatically apply to India.</li><li>Tech cooperation: The Hindu reported the FTA explicitly links the European AI Office with India’s National AI Mission and moves toward joint R&amp;D on advanced semiconductor integration.</li><li>Security track: Alongside trade, India and the EU also signed a Security and Defence Strategic Partnership, with RT reporting Indian firms could participate in the EU’s Security Action for Europe program.</li></ul><blockquote>We have concluded the mother of all deals - Ursula von der Leyen</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of India: Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented the agreement as India’s biggest free trade deal and a starting point for broader cooperation and shared prosperity.
