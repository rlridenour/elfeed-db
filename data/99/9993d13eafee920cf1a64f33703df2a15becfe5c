<p>Of all the cinematic trailblazers to emerge during the early years of the Soviet Union – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/aug/31/artsfeatures1">Vsevolod Pudovkin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Kuleshov">Lev Kuleshov</a> – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dziga_Vertov">Dziga Vertov</a> (né Denis Arkadievitch Kaufman, 1896–1954) was the most radical.</p>
<p>Whereas Eisenstein – as seen in that film school standard <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2012/02/begin_your_cinematic_self-education_with_free_sergei_eisenstein_films.html"><em>Battleship Potemkin</em></a> – used montage editing to create new ways of telling a story, Vertov dispensed with story altogether. He loathed fiction films. “The film drama is the Opium of the people,” he <a href="http://sensesofcinema.com/2003/great-directors/vertov/">wrote</a>. “Down with Bourgeois fairy-tale scenarios…long live life as it is!”&nbsp; He called for the creation of a new kind of cinema free of the counter-revolutionary baggage of Western movies. A cinema that captured real life.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his masterpiece, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGYZ5847FiI">A Man with a Movie Camera</a> </em>(1929) – which was named in 2012 by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310082551/https://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time"><em>Sight and Sound</em></a> magazine as the 8th best movie ever made – Vertov announced exactly what that kind of cinema would look like:</p>
<blockquote><p>This film is an experiment in cinematic communication of real events without the help of intertitles, without the help of a story, without the help of theatre. This experimental work aims at creating a truly international language of cinema based on its absolute separation from the language of theatre and literature.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gleefully using jump cuts, superimpositions, split screens and every other trick in a filmmaker’s arsenal, Vertov, along with his editor (and wife) Elizaveta Svilova, crafts a dizzying, impressionistic, propulsive portrait of the newly industrializing Soviet Union. The lengths to which Vertov goes to capture this “cinematic communication of real events” are startling: His camera soars over cities and gazes up at streetcars; it films machines chugging away and even records a woman giving birth. “I am eye. I am a mechanical eye,” Vertov once famously <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/204978.Dziga_Vertov">wrote</a>. “I, a machine, am showing you a world, the likes of which only I can see.”</p>

<p>Yet Vertov’s stroke of genius was to expose the entire artifice of filmmaking within the movie itself. In <em>A Man with a Movie Camera,</em> Vertov shoots footage of his cameramen shooting footage. There’s a recurring shot of an eye staring through a lens. We see images from earlier in the movie getting edited into the film. This sort of cinematic self-reflexivity was decades ahead of its time, influencing such future experimental filmmakers as Chris Marker, Stan Brakhage and especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a> who in 1968 formed a radical filmmaking collective called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dziga_Vertov_Group">The Dziga Vertov Group.</a></p>
<p><em>A Man with a Movie Camera</em> is nothing short of exhilarating. Check it out above.</p>
