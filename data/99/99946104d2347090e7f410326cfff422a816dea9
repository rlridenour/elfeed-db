<p><a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player">Ready Player Mode</a>, which began as a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1dtnjy7/is_there_imageview_but_for_audio/">tiny media-viewing experiment</a>, has now become my daily music player.</p>
<p>Along the way, I moved from regular daily streaming to buying and playing music offline, relying on the odd streaming service exclusively for discovery. This setup's been working great so far. I get unrestricted playback (for life) with the occasional discovery session whenever I see fit.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p><code>Ready Player Mode</code> runs in Emacs. You install it, enable its minor mode (for media recognition), and you're ready to go.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(use-package ready-player
  :ensure t
  :config
  (ready-player-mode +1))
</code></pre>
<p><code>Ready Player Mode</code> will try to use either <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a>, <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">vlc</a>, <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html">ffplay</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPlayer">mplayer</a> (in that order) to play media, but mpv works best.</p>
<h2>Ready to go</h2>
<p>Post setup, you can open media files like any other text file and Emacs will just play it for you. Say, open a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html">dired</a> buffer, navigate to a file, and open as usual.</p>

<h2>Buttons vs key bindings</h2>
<p>If buttons are your cup of tea, use <code>tab</code> or <code>backtab</code> to navigate around.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/buttons.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Alternatively, single-key bindings are available. You can find them all in the transient help menu, via the <code>?</code> binding.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/transient.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Global key bindings</h2>
<p>Global key bindings are available, so you can interact with the player without switching buffers.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/global.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Global bindings are under the <code>C-c m</code> prefix.</p>
<hr>
<p>C-c m SPC   Toggle play/stop of media.
C-c m r     Cycle through repeat settings: file, directory, off.
C-c m m     Toggle switching between player buffer and previous buffer.
C-c m s     Toggle shuffle setting.
C-c m a     Toggle autoplay setting.
C-c m n     Open the next media file in the same directory.
C-c m c     Open my media collection.
C-c m i     Show playback info in the echo area.
C-c m p     Open the previous media file in the same directory.
C-c m /     Search the `dired' playlist for playback (experimental).</p>
<hr>
<p>If you prefer to use other bindings, disable default ones with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(setq ready-player-set-global-bindings nil)
</code></pre>
<h2>Open externally</h2>
<p>You can always open the currently played file externally, using your system default player. This is bound to the <code>e</code> key.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/external.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Repeat, shuffle, and autoplay</h2>
<p>Repeat, shuffle, and autoplay should do what you'd expect and can be toggled via <code>r</code> <code>s</code> and <code>a</code> keys.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/repeat-shuffle-autoplay.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2>Play current directory</h2>
<p>By default, <code>Ready Player</code> will continue playing other media found in the current directory. Use <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> bindings to move through different tracks.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/next.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2>Seek</h2>
<p><code>Ready Player</code> works best with <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a> player. If you have it installed, you can seek through tracks.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/seek.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2>Play your collection</h2>
<p><code>Ready Player</code> can remember your music collection, but needs a tiny addition to the existing setup via the <code>ready-player-my-media-collection-location</code> variable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(use-package ready-player
  :custom
  (ready-player-my-media-collection-location &quot;~/path/to/your/music/collection&quot;)
  :config
  (ready-player-mode +1))
</code></pre>
<p>Your music collection is now available via the home button.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/home.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Index + search</h2>
<p>Your music collection is automatically indexed. Same for the currently played directory, so you can search for tracks.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/magnifying.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/search.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Bookmarking</h2>
<p>This is a new feature inspired by <a href="https://functional.cafe/@tristanC/113896948267754737">tristanC's use</a> of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html">Emacs bookmarks</a> with <code>Ready Player.</code> Bookmarks are now displayed and toggled from the player interface.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/bookmark.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Bookmarks are searchable too.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/search-bookmark.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Download album cover</h2>
<p>Missing album cover? Download it via <code>M-x ready-player-download-album-artwork</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/artwork.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2>Embracing <code>dired</code></h2>
<p>I mentioned playing media from current directory or your music collection, but <code>Ready Player</code> is really just playing media from a <code>dired</code> buffer. If you can craft a <code>dired</code> buffer, <code>Ready Player</code> <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/the-dired-abstraction">should be able to play it</a>. Think <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-and-Find.html">find-dired</a>.</p>
<h2>Advanced features</h2>
<p><code>Ready Player</code> should be umm… ready to play with little configuration. If you want further customizations, check out its <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player?tab=readme-ov-file#all-customizations">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy your unrestricted music offline, now and forever!</p>
