Apple will introduce four new iPhones next week, and the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> will arguably be the least interesting of the bunch. It's not going to get the super slim design like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, nor will it have the upgraded camera setup like the 17 Pro. There are still a handful of features to look forward to, though, which we've outlined below.<br/>
<br/>

This guide is limited to the standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, which will be Apple's most affordable &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; model. We've done similar rumor roundups for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17-air-rumors/">iPhone 17 Air</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17-pro-rumors/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> if you want to check those out.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="size_and_design">Size and Design</h2><br/>
There are usually two standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models, but this year, we're limited to one. Apple is eliminating the "Plus" model and replacing it with the ultra thin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; will look a lot like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, but Apple is expected to increase the display size. Instead of 6.1 inches, it'll be 6.3 inches, similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>. There will be a single 6.3-inch standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; this year.<br/>
<br/>
While the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models will have a pill-shaped camera bar that spans most of the back of each device, rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;'s camera bump isn't going to change. It will continue to have a dual-lens camera setup with a small vertical pill-shaped bump.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="colors">Colors</h3><br/>
The standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models could come in black, white, steel gray, green, purple, and light blue if rumors are correct.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="display">Display</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;'s bezels could be slimmer to bring it in line with the other &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, and it is expected to use the same LTPO display as the current &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;. The display allows for 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, so smoother scrolling is a feature we could see come to the standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="a-series_chip">A-Series Chip</h2><br/>
We're expecting the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; to be equipped with the standard A19 chip, built on an updated 3-nanometer process. The A19 will bring speed and efficiency improvements compared to the A18, but there won't be radical differences.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the A19 Pro that's expected for the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models, the A19 will likely have fewer GPU cores.<br/>
<br/>
All &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models are rumored to feature vapor chamber cooling technology that will disperse heat across a larger surface area to prevent thermal throttling and keep performance stable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will feature Apple's C1 modem, but the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to use Qualcomm modem technology for 5G connectivity.<br/>
<br/>
All four &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models are expected to get Apple's first custom-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip with Wi-Fi 7 support. Apple's chip could bring efficiency and connectivity improvements that result in better battery life.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="charging">Charging</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; will be able to charge at up to 25W with third-party wireless chargers that support the new Qi 2.2 standard.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="cameras">Cameras</h2><br/>
All four &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models will get an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which will improve image quality and allow for more cropping in for selfies. The current selfie camera is limited to 12 megapixels.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; will have the same 48-megapixel Wide and Ultra Wide lenses that are in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, and we haven't heard rumors about upgrades for these lenses.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2><br/>
Rumors about pricing have been mixed, and some analysts have suggested Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/30/iphone-17-price-increase-expected/">might raise prices</a>. If there is an increase, the base &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; could start at &#36;850 instead of &#36;799, but it continues to be unclear if there will indeed be a price hike.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could opt to increase prices for the Air and Pro models while keeping the standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; at &#36;799.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="launch_date">Launch Date</h2><br/>
Apple will introduce the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; at the "Awe Dropping" event that kicks off at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on Tuesday, September 9. If Apple follows the same pre-order and launch timing that it has used in the past, pre-orders could take place on Friday, September 12 with a launch to follow on Friday, September 19.<br/>
