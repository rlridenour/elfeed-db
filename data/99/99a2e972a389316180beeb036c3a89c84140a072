<p>Thailand opened polls on Sunday for an early general election to fill all 500 seats in the House of Representatives. Three main parties are vying for power, and no party is widely expected to win an outright majority. Voters are also weighing a national referendum on whether to start the process of replacing the current military-backed constitution, making it a high-stakes day for both political leadership and the rules that shape it. The contest pits the reformist People’s Party—aligned with Thailand’s broader pro-democracy movement—against conservative forces including the Bhumjaithai Party and other establishment-aligned rivals. The vote follows a turbulent stretch in which Thailand has cycled through multiple leaders in a short span. The mood is tense: Thailand has a track record of institutions blocking or overturning outcomes that threaten entrenched power. Still, the election and referendum offer a peaceful way for millions of voters to weigh in on the country’s direction amid worries about economic drift and political instability. With forecasts pointing to a fragmented parliament, coalition talks are expected once results come in.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/0UShzhgJzOEv9xg7CrLwyYRc84V73sWVETvaPEnP8KDfueWIqGlf7xxzTLIa7Tv1Y3mvxz8RNlOt6vjY7nB-rPN50JM_XTXIiUM3iozG-8DB41-njhUSwLfJBO7YOyHATMovPBG4qlv9VQAJHf8pKX-SMEWJ7cUr56s2KHPjBDE40W9qKBkcidBdaUYcmOHcwrLcWmJwFllUb5gvPmCob-zzRRni09xk' alt='Election officials inspect ballots before delivery to a local polling station in Narathiwat, Thailand.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>How voting works: About 53 million eligible voters are choosing 500 lower-house lawmakers, with 400 elected in constituencies and 100 allocated proportionally by vote share.</li><li>Polling snapshot: Pre-election surveys put the progressive People’s Party in front, though analysts cautioned that converting votes into governing power in Thailand often depends on post-election maneuvering and decisions by powerful institutions.</li><li>Thaksin factor: Former leader Thaksin Shinawatra remains a looming presence in the campaign from prison, a reminder of how older political divisions still shape today’s race.</li><li>Last election’s lesson: Reports noted that reformists came first in the previous vote but conservatives ultimately led the government, underscoring how outcomes can shift after ballots are counted.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>People’s Party: The party has recalibrated its presentation—toning down some imagery and messaging—to reassure more cautious voters while sticking with a pro-democracy platform, according to reporting on its campaign strategy.
