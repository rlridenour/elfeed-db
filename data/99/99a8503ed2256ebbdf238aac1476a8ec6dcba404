<p>A car exploded near the historic Red Fort in New Delhi on Monday evening, killing at least eight people and injuring dozens, officials and local media reported. Delhi Police have opened an investigation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act — India’s main anti‑terrorism statute — and local outlets said a former owner of the vehicle was arrested as part of the probe. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking from Bhutan, vowed that those responsible would be brought to justice as security was tightened in the capital and foreign missions issued travel guidance for the area.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/deqeSg4DJd0SxqgK7bPMD4knzG48NCpkzQR32a5xTYis8WnfqqGys4R10Pbq41vyIkcGNogyUQhbPsgeyuqwuvCYVvuIiwjzyqS9ON-Hco03iACR5Zu0Uk6B0nTnlperBXy5yHol_L65ZCTd_yeyUWAkpR1npAIzaLlQMftSjwBvcc3-nUXpnClEC6gz_hFW6ML4sNapRJ6i1JS1DEA83-AP' alt='Security personnel at the site of an explosion near the historic Red Fort in the old quarters of Delhi, India, on Tuesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scene details: The blast occurred at about 7pm when a slow-moving vehicle stopped at a red light near a busy metro station, and several nearby vehicles were damaged or caught fire, with six vehicles and three autorickshaws reported ablaze.</li><li>Investigation steps: Forensic teams are collecting samples and investigators say they are &#x27;keeping all angles open&#x27; while the case proceeds under anti‑terror law.</li><li>Arrest reported: Local media and police sources reported that a man described as a former owner of the car — named only as Salman in initial reports — was arrested in connection with the blast, though officials cautioned details remain under verification.</li><li>Security measures: States and major cities went on high alert with increased vehicle inspections, and the US Embassy in India advised Americans to avoid the Red Fort and Chandni Chowk areas and posted consular contact numbers.</li></ul><blockquote>Our agencies will get to the very bottom of this conspiracy.
