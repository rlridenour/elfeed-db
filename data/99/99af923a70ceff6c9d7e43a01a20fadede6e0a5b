<p>Fourteen years ago this month, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/213994/steve-jobs-resigns-as-apple-ceo.html">Steve Jobs resigned</a> and Tim Cook became the CEO of Apple. Given Jobs’s ongoing health issues, Cook’s ascension wasn’t unexpected; he had, in fact, filled the role during Jobs’s multiple leaves of absence. Cook was a familiar face and promised to be a steady hand at Apple, but if there ever was a <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/213996/apple-turns-to-tim-cook-to-replace-steve-jobs.html">tough act to follow</a>, it was Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>But here we are, living in an era where Cook <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/01/tim-cook-apple-ceo-for-longer-than-steve-jobs/">has now served as Apple CEO longer than Jobs did</a>. The Apple of 2025 is quite different from the company Cook took control of back in 2011. Today’s Apple generates nearly four times the revenue that the company did when Cook took over, driven by more-than-quadrupling iPhone revenue. Back in 2011, there was one iPhone; now there are five, along with several iPad models, a wearables business that basically didn’t exist, an experimental headset, and a revitalized Mac powered by iPhone chips.</p>
<p>It’s been a ride. And while it’s not over yet, now seems as good a time as any to look back at what Cook has done and consider where he and Apple may be going in the future.</p>
