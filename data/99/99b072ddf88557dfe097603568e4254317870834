<blockquote>
  <p>Since X’s users started using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/855832/grok-undressing-children-csam-law-x-elon-musk">Grok to undress women and
children</a> using deepfake images, I have been waiting for
what I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s
and Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet
tells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim
Cook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of
Elon Musk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lopatto’s outrage and righteous anger are justified, but I think mostly misdirected. Apple and Google — and thus, Cook and Pichai, as the men who sit behind the desks where the buck stops at both companies — are culpable. But this is ultimately not about them, and not about Musk. It’s Trump, as president, they fear. Not Musk. And they are correct to fear Trump.</p>

<p>Year one of Trump 2.0 has crystallized what had become — after decades of deliberate restraint after World War II, and even more so after the end of the Cold War — overlooked. The Presidency of the United States bestows upon its officeholder enormous, unparalleled, power. No one was afraid of Trump after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. The man was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/30/g-s1-1848/trump-hush-money-trial-34-counts">convicted of 34 felonies in a cold New York City courtroom in May 2024</a>, a mere 19 months ago. Trump expected and asked for riots outside the courtroom. He got nothing but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/nyregion/trump-trial-supporters.html">pathetic support from a handful of kooks</a>. A year earlier, he lost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll_v._Donald_J._Trump">a humiliating sexual assault civil lawsuit to E. Jean Carroll</a>. Trump, just a year and a half ago, was a buffoon getting his mug shot taken. Today he’s arguing that his power is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/us/politics/trump-interview-power-morality.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DVA.5wt4.ux02n3D96aZH&amp;smid=url-share">unchecked by anything other than his own sense of morality</a>.</p>

<p>No other president has ever abused (or, if you support him, wielded) the powers of the office like Trump has. The power and influence of Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, CEOs of two of the top five companies in the world, isn’t merely superseded by Trump’s power and influence as president. Their power and influence are <em>dwarfed</em> by Trump’s. Any credible argument about how they should act must acknowledge that profound imbalance.</p>

<p>Lopatto, in her closing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever
again. The next time Tim Cook says “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-slams-facebook-privacy-human-right-it-n860816">privacy is a human
right</a>,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face.
I mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has
created an <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2026/01/grok-x-musk-deepfake-renee-good-ice/">undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good</a>,
the mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How <em>do</em> you plan
to defend getting rid of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/791170/iceblock-app-store-removed-by-apple">ICEBlock app</a> while allowing X
to generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed? Can Apple and
Google even identify their values beyond their commitment to
“shareholder value”? What’s your fucking endgame here, guys?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The profound power imbalance here is frustrating. But also terrifying. It’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">folly to think these CEOs should steer their companies into direct confrontation with Trump</a>. It would do no ultimate good for Apple or Google to burn themselves to the ground in protest. These men aren’t beholden to shareholders, per se. They’re doing their duty to institutions they’ve devoted their lives to. Companies that are worth preserving and protecting. Perhaps not in your estimation, but certainly from theirs.</p>

<p>But abject obsequiousness — which more and more seems the path Cook and Pichai are choosing — is no more justifiable a response than corporate suicide. The situation is not binary: acquiescence or war. There is a broad middle ground, founded on principle.</p>

<p>Disney’s response to the Jimmy Kimmel controversy a few months ago <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/07/hodges-cook-iceblock">shows the way</a>. Defend the company’s principles while simultaneously defending the company from Trump’s demented wrath. You can take the position of “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/03/fuck-you-make-me">Fuck you, make me</a>” without ever saying those words. Objection is not confrontation. Do the right thing and enforce the App Store and Play Store guidelines, and remove X and Grok from the stores. Make Musk object. Make the Trump administration object. Make them defend the indefensible — in public. Make clear why the apps were removed from the app stores and force Musk — and Trump, if he chooses — to argue that those things are A-OK by them. In court.</p>

<p>The judicious path for Apple and Google (and every other U.S. company) may well be to obey the law, even when the law is being actively corrupted. But the correct path is <em>not</em> to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/on-tyranny">obey in advance</a>. Stand behind the law while the law still exists on your side. Disney resisted Trump’s preposterous demand that they fire Jimmy Kimmel without lasting controversy, simply by standing firm in their conviction. Apple and Google could certainly do the same regarding apps that are being used to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1mzlryxeo">generate CSAM</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/x-paywall-ai-image-grok-app-bikini-allows-sexual-deepfakes-rcna252647">deepfake harassment</a>, regardless if the apps are part of the private fiefdom of Trump’s ally Elon Musk. It’s wise for Cook and Pichai to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/08/gold_frankincense_and_silicon">pick their battles</a>. This one, I think, is worth picking. This is a moment when the App Store and Play Store can stand firmly on the side of longstanding and correct societal norms.</p>
