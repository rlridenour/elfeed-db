</ul><h1>That's A Reach</h1><p>At the morning team meeting, morale was low.</p>
<p>“Coach, I just don’t know if I can do it today,” Thad said. “Put me down for a DNP-Rest.”</p>
<p>“Same, coach,” Andy said. “After the back-to-back-to-back this weekend, I just don’t have it in me either.”</p>
<p>“Coach, I hate to pile on,” Sarah said, “but I’m dealing with some serious lateral pectitits.”</p>
<p>“Hey, so, everyone,” Martin said, “we call this a ‘team meeting’ to build camaraderie and promote collaborative thinking. But, at the end of the day, we’re not a team in the sports sense. We’re a digital marketing firm.”</p>
<p>“So, you’re saying I can’t get that DNP, coach?” Thad said.</p>
<p>“No,” Martin said. “And you don’t have to call me coach. I’m your project manager.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s more like baseball, then? There’s an IL?” Andy asked.</p>
<p>“That’s not at all what I’m saying,” Martin said. “There’s personal time and sick time. But Andy, you said you had a ‘back-to-back-to-back’ this weekend. Are you playing rec league basketball or something?”</p>
<p>“No,” Andy said. “I raked leaves on Saturday and had to lean over a lot. Then, on Sunday, I took a nice walk, and I saw something on the sidewalk and leaned over to look at <em>that</em>. I’m a forty-two-year-old man without core strength. Leaning over two days in a row? I’m bound to tweak something in my <em>back</em>. Hence, the ‘back-to-back-to-back.’”</p>
<p>Martin turned his attention to Sarah. “And what are you dealing with?”</p>
<p>“A bit of tendinitic discomfort in my bilateral abdominals,” Sarah said.</p>
<p>“Okay, that is not even close to what you said before,” Martin said. “And furthermore, that is simply not a real thing.”</p>
<p>Sarah looked into her coffee. “It sure feels real,” she muttered.</p>
<p>“Look, everyone, you’re sore, I get it,” Martin said. “If you want to take sick time, take it. Otherwise, get a percussion massager and let’s move on. In fact, they’ve got a nice one on Meh today. It’s got a heated head and six interchangeable tips for targeted massages. Plus, you can extend the arm, allowing you to reach places without asking someone else for help.”</p>
<p>The team mumbled their approval of this idea.</p>
<p>“Great,” Martin said. “So it’s settled then. Let’s get to work.”</p>
<p>“Coach, one last thing,” Andy said, as the others dispersed. “Can you order that massage gun for me? I forgot my glasses today and if I have to lean in close to the screen to complete the checkout process, I know I’m going to tweak something else.”</p>
<p>“Andy,” Martin said. “We need to talk about your performance.”</p>
