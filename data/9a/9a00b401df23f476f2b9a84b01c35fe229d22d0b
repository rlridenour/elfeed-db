Apple today provided developers with a revised version of the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta for testing purposes. The update is only available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, so if you're running &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14 or earlier, you won't see the revised beta.<br/>

Registered developers can download the new beta software through the Settings app on each device.<br/>
<br/>
The revised beta addresses an issue that could cause some &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models to show a low battery symbol and be unable to start up after updating to the initial &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; beta. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; includes all of the new features that were shown off at Apple's keynote event on Monday. Apple debuted its Liquid Glass design, which you'll find throughout &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and Apple's other software updates.<br/>
<br/>
Along with a refreshed design, there are a long list of new features in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, including changes to Messages, Phone, Safari, Music, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, Camera, and more.<br/>
<br/>
While today's beta is limited to developers to give them time to learn the new features and adjust their apps, Apple will provide public beta testers with a chance to try the software in July. &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26 are set to launch to the public in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/apple-seeds-revised-ios-26-developer-beta/">Apple Seeds Revised iOS 26 Developer Beta to Fix Battery Issue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-revised-ios-26-developer-beta-to-fix-battery-issue.2458953/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
