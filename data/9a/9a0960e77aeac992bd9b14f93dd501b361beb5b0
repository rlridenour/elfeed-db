Writing into the quiet
2025-09-08-02
</p>

<p>
There's a conversation <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> about whether blogging
is lonely
and I wanted to reflect on that
from the perspective of 24ish years
of sharing notes on my
idiosyncratic interests.
Blog conversations remind me
of the Great Conversation
between book authors<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
sometimes with centuries
in between. In contrast, blogs.
are quick, open, convivial.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to developing ideas,
I like public writing more than
the ephemeral cacophany of
in-person conversations,
social media @replies
or private e-mails.
</p>

<p>
My notes are often for my present understanding
and sometimes for my future selves.
If they resonate with others: bonus!
</p>

<p>
I think this might be a useful way to think about it.
</p>

<p>
Write out of self-interest.
Leave the door open for serendipity
</p>

<p>
Then it's not about
"No one's liking or commenting"
or even
"Why can't I find other people like me"
</p>

<p>
It's more like:
I'll keep exploring and taking notes, because it's fun.
Maybe I'll bump into others and swap notes someday. Who knows?
</p>

There's a conversation about feeling lonely while
blogging that echoes through the years. Here's a
recent instance: <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/do-blogs-need-to-be-so-lonely/">Do blogs need to be so lonely? -
The History of the Web</a>; I also liked <a href="https://birming.com/2025/09/07/the-silent-applause/">The silent
applause | Robert Birming</a> and <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/blogs-don-t-need-to-be-so-lonely">Blogs don’t need to
be so lonely – Manu</a>. Me, I mostly write for
myself, and I don't feel particularly lonely doing
so. It's a pleasant surprise whenever I hear from
someone, but it's not my main goal. I'm content to
plod along, trying to untangle my thoughts and
leave some breadcrumbs for my future self. This
has been very handy not only for technical posts,
but also for things like being able to remember
what it was like to be a twenty-something. Writing
into the quiet without expecting a reply is like
enjoying a comfortably silent beach and
occasionally being delighted when you discover
someone else's message in a bottle.
</p>

<p>
Blog conversations are so much faster than book
conversations. We don't have to pass through
publishing gatekeepers, we don't have to wait
years&hellip; just ideas bouncing back and forth.
Marvelous.
</p>

<p>
Commenting is easier than writing from scratch, so
it would be nice to give people that space to
share their follow-on thoughts more easily, but
it's becoming more of a hassle as parts of the Web
become more hostile. (Thanks, spammers and
advertising cookie-trackers.) <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/03/moving-18-years-of-comments-out-of-disqus-and-into-my-11ty-static-site/">I turned off
comments on my blog</a> back in March as Disqus had
gotten overbearing with ads and tracking. I didn't
feel like figuring out another commenting service
or self-hosting my own. I don't miss wading
through all the spam. I do miss the ease of public
comments and the tips people shared, mostly
because it was convenient to see and share those
replies in one place. Still, there's space for
commentary. Some people comment via Mastodon or
their own blogs. Once in a blue moon, a post will
strike enough of a chord to get shared via Reddit
or something like that. And there's always e-mail.
</p>

<p>
I like <a href="https://indieweb.org/blog_carnival">blog carnivals</a>: someone proposes a theme,
people can choose to write about it, and the host
links to all those posts for easier discovery.
There's one for <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival">IndieWeb</a> and there's one for
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Carnival">Emacs</a>. It's fun seeing all these different takes
on the same topic.
</p>

<p>
I wish it was easier for more people to share what
they've been figuring out. I don't think the
technology is the limiting factor. My mom used to
keep a blog on Blogger, and she also wrote some
posts in the self-hosted Wordpress I'd set up for
her before. My sister writes long stories on
Facebook and Instagram so that she can untangle
her thoughts and capture the memories. Never mind
that Facebook is a walled garden that's hard to
follow outside its algorithmic feed; at least
she's writing. I think it's more that the process
of sitting down and turning your thoughts into
words takes time and energy. That's the hard part,
but that's also what's worthwhile. You can't skip
it by using a large language model.
</p>

<p>
Is writing lonely? I wish more people had the
space to sit with their thoughts and figure them
out, and I wish they were easier to find. I'll
settle for reaching across time and space: to my
future self, for sure, and maybe to others whom I
may or may not interact with. Send enough bottles
out to sea, comb the beach often enough, and I'll
find plenty of people who like to take that quiet,
thoughtful approach to life (even as we gently
poke fun at ourselves for possibly overthinking
things). Fortunately, if they blog, it's easy to
keep in touch lightly: not limited by anyone's
energy or interest at a particular point in time,
but just open to serendipity.

<p>
<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><time class="timestamp" datetime="2025-09-09">[2025-09-09 Tue]</time></span>: A few more thoughts I want to connect to this one:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Henrik Karlsson's essay on <a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query">writing as a search query for people</a></li>
<li>I came across <a href="https://twilightjournal.com/">Twilight Journal</a> via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/">r/stoicism</a> today, so I wanted to link to that too. Messages in bottles.</li>
<li>And another thought about the night sky and how it's filled with stars, even though there are unimaginable spaces between them&hellip; (Not that I've seen a clear night sky lately, but I have one clear memory of it as a child that stays with me.)</li>
