Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup launched in the fall of 2027 will be called the "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 20" models, rather than the "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 19," according to research firm Omdia.<br/>

Speaking at a conference in Seoul (via <a href="https://www.etnews.com/20251022000335"><em>ETNews</em></a>), Omdia Chief Researcher Heo Moo-yeol corroborated rumors that Apple plans to move the launch of its standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to the first half of the year and provided some additional clarity about what to expect through to the end of 2027.<br/>
<br/>
In the first half of 2027, Apple will launch the "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18e" and "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a>." Then, in the second half of the year, Apple will launch a next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>, "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 20 Pro," "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 20 Pro Max," and second-generation foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
The move is said to be part of a broader attempt to reset the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s naming system and revitalize the product lineup around the device's 20th anniversary. There is a strong argument that Apple will skip "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 19" nomenclature. For the 10th anniversary of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in 2017, Apple skipped the "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 9" and simply launched the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X (roman numeral for 10) alongside the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 Plus.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's plan to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/no-iphone-18-in-2026/">push the release</a> of its standard model to the first half of the year to launch alongside a new "e" model is now widely rumored. Omdia says that from next year, Apple is expecting reduced demand due to the change, with no "&zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj;" launching in 2026, and will temporarily reduce &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; panel orders by 20 million units as a result. In the long term, this is expected to be offset by shipments of foldable iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
In August, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/no-iphone-18-in-2026/"><em>ETNews</em> reported</a> that Apple had informed some of its suppliers that the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; will not be part of the fall 2026 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup. Instead, the company will unveil only higher-end models in the second half of next year.<br/>
<br/>
Both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/apple-split-iphone-launch-strategy/"><em>The Information</em></a> and Apple supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/base-iphone-18-spring-2027-launch/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> reported in May that Apple was considering moving to a biannual schedule to help sustain sales throughout the calendar year. By staging new device launches in both halves of the year, Apple could avoid the concentrated sales pattern that typically peaks in the fourth quarter following its September events and tap into periods that historically see weaker consumer demand. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup is believed to be the last to have followed Apple's traditional release structure. <br/>

<small>*Omdia initially calls this early 2027 model the "&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 20," but this is likely a mistake and refers to the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj;, as it implies later in its report. The standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 20 will probably follow in the first half of 2028.</small><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/20th-anniversary-iphone/">20th-Anniversary iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/etnews-com/">ETNews</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/omdia/">Omdia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/23/apple-to-skip-iphone-19-name/">Report: Apple to Skip &#039;iPhone 19&#039; Name for &#039;iPhone 20&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-to-skip-iphone-19-name-for-iphone-20.2469662/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
