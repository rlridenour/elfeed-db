<p>Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, the eldest son of jailed former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, has announced that he will run for Brazil’s presidency in the 2026 election with his father’s explicit backing. The move positions him as the standard-bearer of Brazil’s conservative camp and as a likely challenger to current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is eligible to seek a second consecutive term. Jair Bolsonaro, currently imprisoned and barred from running for office, is reported by party officials and his son to have named Flávio as his political heir and preferred candidate during internal discussions with their Liberal Party (PL). The announcement, which surprised some investors who had expected a more experienced right-wing figure to unify conservatives, coincided with a fall in Brazilian markets, reflecting uncertainty over the opposition’s direction ahead of the vote. Despite legal and political turbulence surrounding his family, Flávio says he will seek to continue the &quot;nation&#x27;s project&quot; started under his father, signaling continuity rather than a break with Bolsonaro-era policies.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fU4FUHJfFQ1ht3BwCRsKwxVabWmRdVWYuX3M98-ptbXzqu9pzucqEcEkDujfOUrRU_6lC6IXphSWlbQ58ifgOAZzgM1dTuL7rMg7R8IUsAj0APWoQjOqKLJcwCke4Z6Shge-fQJ-rVp0W-WOtZrmcQc_F2obEKWFE9WKdgskTw' alt='Senator Flávio Bolsonaro speaks to supporters after announcing his intention to run for Brazil&#x27;s presidency in 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Party dynamics: Officials from the Liberal Party said Jair Bolsonaro informed them of his choice of Flávio as the right wing’s main presidential contender during a private meeting, effectively sidelining other figures who had been seen as potential standard-bearers.</li><li>Role in Congress: Flávio currently serves as a senator representing Rio de Janeiro and has used his position in the upper house to defend his father’s legacy and criticize President Lula’s agenda, giving him a national platform ahead of the official campaign period.</li><li>Economic jitters: Brazilian assets and the local currency weakened after news of Jair Bolsonaro’s endorsement of Flávio, as investors had anticipated a more market-familiar conservative candidate emerging to contest Lula’s left-leaning economic program.</li><li>Dynastic framing: Flávio publicly described himself as the heir to his father’s political project and a leader for Brazil’s conservative movement, framing the 2026 race as a continuation of the Bolsonaro political dynasty rather than a fresh start on the right.</li><li>Campaign message: In announcing his intentions, Flávio pledged to &quot;continue the nation&#x27;s project&quot; associated with his father’s presidency, appealing directly to Bolsonaro’s voter base that remains influential in Brazil’s polarized political landscape.</li></ul><blockquote>I am prepared to assume this mission - Flávio Bolsonaro</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Flávio Bolsonaro: He said he is ready to lead Brazil’s conservative movement and present himself as the continuation of his father’s political agenda in the 2026 presidential race.
