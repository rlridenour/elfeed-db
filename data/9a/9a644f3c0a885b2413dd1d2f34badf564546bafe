<p>
When I started to use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> to write this blog last year, I noticed that there is an <a href="https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-hugo">easy-hugo</a> package of Emacs many people use. So I installed it at that time, but I didn&#39;t use many of its features since then. In fact, the only command I used was <code class="verbatim">easy-hugo-current-time</code>. I used it to update the Hugo timestamps manually as in the format of <code class="verbatim">2022-10-15T09:45:35+08:00</code>.</p>
<p>
My most desirable feature is to use it to select tags easily when I start to write a new post, but I never got it to work.</p>
