The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max can charge at up to 25W using the next-generation Qi2.2 chargers. Qi2.2 is an upgraded specification that matches the 25W charging speed of the updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> specification introduced last year. <br/>

Apple debuted &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; 2 last year, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models can charge at up to 25W over &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, so now the new devices will be able to get the same charging speed with Qi2.2.<br/>
<br/>
Qi2.2 charging speeds require a Qi2.2 charger, and accessory makers are starting to come out with wireless charging options that support the new standard. <br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Air is limited to 20W charging over &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; and Qi2.2, so it is not able to reach the 25W charging speeds that other models are capable of. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-25w-qi-charging/">iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Models Support 25W Qi2.2 Charging</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-and-iphone-17-pro-models-support-25w-qi2-2-charging.2465007/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
