<p>As I was looking more into widows management in Emacs, particularly viewing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbdE7oZEdtA&amp;t=1191s">System Crafters' video</a> about the topic which I mentioned in my <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/05/05/windows-in-emacs-probably-come.html">previous post</a>, I learned a couple of things (or maybe re-learned? I probably used to know about them at some point in the past).</p>
<p>One of my issues with windows in Emacs right now is that whenever I open Dired, it takes over my current window. I often just want to view my files in the directory my current buffer is in.</p>
<p>The answer is simple: instead of opening Dired (<code>C-x d</code>), just &ldquo;jump&rdquo; into Dired in another window, which is <code>dired-jump-other-window</code> or <code>C-x 4 C-j</code>. This improves my workflows twice: first, I usually want to open Dired in the directory the buffer I&rsquo;m working in is, and second, I want it in another window. With this command, I don&rsquo;t need to specify the directory; it just takes me where I want<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, as I was writing this post, I realized another problem with Emacs windows placement was actually <em>my</em> problem all along (user error dance, anyone?): <code>C-x b</code> is bound to <code>consult-buffer-other-window</code> on my system, which does what it says, opening the buffer I want in the <em>other</em> window. I thought this was the command to open a buffer, forgetting that there&rsquo;s such a thing as opening a buffer in the other window. Using the logic I just learned, it would probably make more sense to bind <code>consult-buffer-other-window</code> to <code>C-x 4 b</code> (for me, it runs the default Emacs <code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>, which I don&rsquo;t use<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>) and then <code>consult-buffer</code> (which is not bound to anything for me) to be <code>C-x b</code>. This will disrupt my muscle memory for a while, but eventually it will lead to a better workflow.</p>
<p>Another nice thing I didn&rsquo;t know and learned from watching this video is that I can scroll up and down in the other window while still keeping the focus on the current buffer with <code>M-pgup</code> and <code>M-pgdn</code>. This is nice if I want to read help documentation while working on something, reading definitions with Emacs' built-in dictionary, or maybe using Occur or something similar, where just reading for reference is enough.</p>
<p>Then we have a built-in way to move between windows that I was looking for a while: <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WindMove">windmove</a>. Turns out it&rsquo;s been there since Emacs 21, which means that for me, it was there all this time, and I didn&rsquo;t know about it. Windmove lets you switch between windows using the shift and arrow keys by default, so that <code>S-up</code> would move you one window up, while <code>S-down</code> will move you down. You need to enable it and then enable its default keybindings, or assign it alternative keybindings.</p>
<p>Looking at these key-bindings, I can see why it&rsquo;s turned off by default. Shift plus an arrow key is used extensively in org-mode, for example, so you can&rsquo;t use these keys. Using something else, say,  <code>C+M+left</code> or <code>C+M+right</code>, is not good either because on Linux, this will &ldquo;swish&rdquo; your workplaces (&ldquo;spaces&rdquo; in macOS), while the meta key plus an arrow is also taken by something else in Emacs&hellip; you get the idea, finding the keys to use is getting a bit problematic. You need to figure out what you can give up, or find a creative shortcut that works for you specifically. However, this seems too useful to pass up, so I think I&rsquo;m going to dedicate keys to it very soon.</p>
<p>The video also goes over windmove&rsquo;s sibling, <code>windmove-swap-states-[direction]</code>, which switches the windows in the direction you tell it. So if I am working on this post in a window that is above a list of links I&rsquo;m using as reference in the window below in another buffer, I can use <code>windmove-swap-states-down</code> to switch. Now I will be working in the lower window, and the list of links will be in the window above. This is good if I want my list of files in Dired to the window to the right, but <code>dired-jump-other-window</code> opened it in the window below, for example. Nice, it saves a few <code>C-x 0</code> and <code>C-x 1</code> maneuvers.</p>
<p>Then there are the external packages, of course.
ace window is probably the most popular one, and this video provides a brief demonstration of it. The idea is that it numbers the windows for you on the screen, and then you select a number to jump to a window. Another package I learned about is <a href="https://github.com/deb0ch/emacs-winum">winum</a>, which is built on top of this idea, but it displays the window number in the minibuffer of each window all the time, and then it&rsquo;s a matter of <code>C-x #</code> to jump to that window. It integrates into Emacs better in my opinion, and if you use many windows, it probably makes sense. I usually have no more than four windows open at once, so using the built-in <code>windmove</code> is probably better.</p>
<p>Alright, I&rsquo;m off to rebind some keys and do some tweaking! Then we will see how much I need to mess with Emacs&rsquo;s built-in logic for windows placement. It might just make a little more sense now.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>
<p><sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup>: it&rsquo;s building on <code>dired-jump</code> (<code>C-x C-j</code>), which opens dired in the directory the buffer I&rsquo;m in. So, if I&rsquo;m working on <code>bills.org</code>, which is under <code>~/Documents/personal/</code>, dired-jump will open dired inside <code>~/Documents/personal/</code>. The problem for me is that it will take over my current buffer (where I have <code>bills.org</code> open), which I don&rsquo;t want; this is where <code>dired-jump-other-window</code> comes in: it will open Dired in a separate window.</p>
<p><sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup>: this Emacs keys and windows management rabbit hole makes me re-appriciate Emacs&rsquo;s default key binding. They&rsquo;re there for a reason. They might not make sense at start&hellip; or maybe for several years, depending on how often and how much you use Emacs and what for, but now I see how <code>C-x 4</code> is an entire family of key combinations tied to &ldquo;other window&rdquo; functions and then other key bindings start to make sense. For some of you veteran Emacs users, this might be obvious, but for me, that&rsquo;s a slap on the forehead with a &ldquo;Ohhh! So this is why this keybinding is like this!&rdquo;</p>
