<p>Here&rsquo;s a screen capture of one of the things that drives me nuts with Outlook.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Outlook let me forward this email? Why is it grayed out? The messages under this one are fine, this one is not. It&rsquo;s not a conversation or a thread; I have those disabled. So what gives?</p>
