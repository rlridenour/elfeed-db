<p>I&#8217;ve been talking to my computer for decades, and it&#8217;s finally paying off for everyone.</p>



<p>Yesterday I dictated this entire newsletter into my iPad mini using the <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts app</a> and <a href="https://whispermemos.com">WhisperMemos</a> while sitting in my backyard. No special microphone, no training sessions, no leaving awkward pauses between words like I had to do in the old days.</p>



<p>Just hit the red button and start talking. The fact that this works still amazes me.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Long Road to Here</h2>



<p>My dictation journey started with Dragon Dictate, back before it became Dragon NaturallySpeaking. You had to… leave… spaces… between… each… word… or… it… didn&#8217;t… work.</p>



<p>Even when I got pretty skilled at it, every document needed serious cleanup afterward. The software had no context, so &#8220;their&#8221; and &#8220;there&#8221; were constant battles, and forget about getting proper names right, even with extensive training.</p>



<p>For years, dictation felt like a promising technology that never quite delivered on its promise. You needed professional microphones, quiet rooms, and the patience of a saint. Most people tried it once and gave up.</p>



<p>But something fundamental has changed. The AI models powering today&#8217;s dictation tools understand context in ways the old systems never could. They don&#8217;t need training on your voice, they handle background noise gracefully, and they make intelligent guesses about what you actually meant to say. It&#8217;s the difference between a computer transcribing sounds and an AI re-constructing speech.</p>



<p>There are so many good Whisper-based apps available now. The real breakthrough isn&#8217;t any single app, it&#8217;s that we&#8217;ve crossed a threshold where dictation just works.</p>



<p>The hardware requirements have disappeared, too. I&#8217;m dictating this on an iPad mini using its built-in microphone. No headset, no external mic, no special setup. Because I’m outside right now, there birds chirping and a trash truck drove down the street a few minutes ago. It doesn’t matter. The same device that&#8217;s perfectly fine for FaceTime calls turns out to be perfectly fine for dictation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How It Changes Your Writing</h2>



<p>Thinking verbally is different from thinking with your fingers or a pencil. When I dictate, I err on the side of abundance in my first draft, then edit ruthlessly. It&#8217;s perfect for my natural workflow.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s something about speaking your thoughts that makes the writing more personal. When I&#8217;m typing or writing by hand, I tend to edit myself before the words hit the page. With dictation, ideas flow more freely. I&#8217;m more willing to explore tangents and follow interesting threads. You can always clean it up later.</p>



<p>Part of me still thinks fondly of Captain Picard doing his captain&#8217;s log on the Enterprise. That&#8217;s basically me every day now, creating content for you.</p>



<p>If dictation makes you nervous because your thoughts come out messy, solve that with preparation. Spend some time making a mind map or outline before you hit record. Then trust that you can fix it in the edit, and let your voice get a little more personal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Give It Another Shot</h2>



<p>Not everyone has delved as deeply into this rabbit hole as I have, but I&#8217;m telling you: if you tried dictation in the past and gave up, it&#8217;s worth revisiting. We can finally declare dictation a solved problem. I honestly didn&#8217;t know that would happen in my lifetime.</p>



<p>The tools are there, they work reliably, and they&#8217;re getting better every month. Whether it&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s built-in dictation (which is acceptable but not best-in-class), or some third-party Whisper-adjacent transcriber, pick one and give it a real try for a week.</p>
