<blockquote>
  <p>The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, had initially
planned to announce cease-and-desist orders targeting the tech
giants on Tuesday and had informed at least one of the companies
of that timing, people familiar with the matter said. Both
companies could have also been slapped with fines.</p>

<p>The decision to postpone the announcement was made shortly before
EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič met with U.S. officials in
Washington on Monday, for his first in-person talks since
President Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs. In
addition, this week Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni met with
Trump, who said he would have “very little problem” making a trade
deal with the EU.</p>

<p>The rulings are still expected to go ahead, and it isn’t
immediately clear how long the delay might last.</p>
