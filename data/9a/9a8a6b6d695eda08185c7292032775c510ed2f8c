improvements for seqs. Briefly:</span></p>
<ul><li>Access to and updating of elements at the beginning or end of a long seq is now faster.</li><li>I have finally gotten around to implementing <span style="font-family: Inconsolata;"><code>search</code></span> and <span style="font-family: Inconsolata;"><code>mismatch</code></span> on seqs.  <b>NOTE:</b> this may require changes to your package definitions; see below.</li><li>Seqs containing only characters are now treated specially, making them a viable replacement for CL strings in many cases.</li><li>In an FSet 2 context, the seq constructor macros now permit specification of a default.</li><li>There are changes to some <span style="font-family: Inconsolata;"><code>convert</code></span> methods.</li><li>There are a couple more FSet 2 API changes, involving <span style="font-family: Inconsolata;"><code>image</code></span>.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;See the above links for the full release notes.</p><p>&nbsp;UPDATE: there's already a v2.1.1; I had forgotten to export the new function <span style="font-family: Inconsolata;">char-seq?</span>.</p>
