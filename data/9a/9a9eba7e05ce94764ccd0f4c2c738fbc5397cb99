<p>I&rsquo;m considering freezing or canceling my Adobe plan.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s supposed to be $10 for Photoshop and Lightroom, it&rsquo;s now $16 after tax and some other thing, and I don&rsquo;t use it enough to justify it. For what I need, built in tools in Photos, Gimp Krita and Darkroom are more than enough.</p>
