I just had yet another case of stuff I am responsible to maintain breaking because of Google. My long-standing program has run with the following code:
google.setOnLoadCallback(function() { /* ... */ }); This has worked for a decade, but finally it seems to have broken. Fortunately, I already had a suspicion that it was a google thing breaking on me as this has happened before. While I am not part of whatever update list is warning about these upcoming changes, they were at least decent enough to tell me that I need to load() charts first.
