Apple today said its <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/hornsby/">store</a> at the Westfield Hornsby shopping mall, in Hornsby, Australia, will be permanently closing in October.<br/>
<br/>

In a statement <a href="https://eftm.com/2025/07/hornsby-apple-store-to-close-chatswood-chase-takes-the-north-shore-customer-load-264516">shared with Australian tech news website EFTM</a> (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1m028x5/hornsby_apple_store_to_close_chatswood_chase/">Reddit</a>), Apple said that it has decided not to renew its lease at Westfield Hornsby. Apple said all affected retail employees will be given the opportunity to work at Apple's nearby store <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/retail/chatswoodchase/">at the Chatswood Chase</a> shopping mall, in Chatswood, which is set to reopen in October.<br/>
<br/>
Hornsby is a suburb of Sydney, on the Upper North Shore. Apple opened its store there in 2011.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Chatswood Chase has been closed for renovations for many months. Apple said the store will be completely redesigned, and it will offer an Apple Pickup station for collecting online orders, and a dedicated area for Today at Apple sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not provide a specific reason for the Hornsby store closure, but it is clearly consolidating its North Shore retail presence into the Chatswood Chase store.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has six other stores in the Sydney area.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Hornsby will be at least the fifth Apple Store location to permanently close in less than three years. Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/apple-bristol-permanently-closing/">closing a store in Bristol, England</a> next month, and it closed its store <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/apple-northbrook-permanent-closing-date/">in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook</a> in April. In 2023, the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apples-infinite-loop-store-closing-next-month/">permanently closed its Infinite Loop and Royal Hawaiian stores</a> simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Apple continues to open new stores in several countries, including the U.S., Spain, Sweden, Malaysia, South Korea, China, and others. In the U.S., Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/apple-previews-miami-worldcenter-store/">opened a new store in Miami</a> earlier this year, and in the Los Angeles area last year. Apple is also planning to open a store <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/apple-store-downtown-detroit-coming-soon/">in Downtown Detroit</a> soon.<br/>

In Australia, Apple just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/26/new-apple-store-perth-australia/">relocated its store in Perth</a> to a historic bank building.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/14/apple-store-in-australia-permanently-closing/">Apple Store Near Sydney Permanently Closing Later This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-near-sydney-permanently-closing-later-this-year.2461562/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
