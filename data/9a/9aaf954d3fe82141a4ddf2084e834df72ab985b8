<blockquote>
  <p>Nintendo is pushing back preorders for the Switch 2 due to
concerns about Donald Trump’s newly announced tariffs. According
to a statement sent to The Verge by Eddie Garcia on behalf of
Nintendo, it says preorders will no longer begin on April 9th:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April
9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and
evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a
later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.</p>

<p>Riots in the streets.</p>
