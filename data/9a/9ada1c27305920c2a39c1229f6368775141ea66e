The AirPlay 2 functionality enables streaming videos, photos, presentations, and audio from iPhone, iPad, and Mac apps including Safari, while HomeKit compatibility lets users power projectors on or off via voice commands or include them in automated smart home scenes.<br/>
<blockquote>"By integrating Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit into our projector line-up, we're addressing the needs of teachers, business professionals, and home users who value ease of use," said Massimo Pizzocri, vice president of Epson Europe's video projector division.</blockquote>Apple AirPlay 2 and Apple HomeKit come pre-installed on select Epson projectors, including models from the PowerLite EB-L6, EB-L7, and EB-L8 series. These are fixed-lens laser projectors offering WUXGA resolution and up to 8,000 lumens of brightness. Epson also offers more affordable options for business and education settings, such as the EB-994F, EB-FH54, and EB-L690SU. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/21/epson-airplay-2-homekit-support-projectors/">Epson Adds AirPlay 2 and HomeKit Support to Latest Projector Range</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epson-adds-airplay-2-and-homekit-support-to-latest-projector-range.2457445/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
