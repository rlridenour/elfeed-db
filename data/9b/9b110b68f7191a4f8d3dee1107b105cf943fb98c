In response to a sermon on Daniel 3:
</p>

 <p>
How shall we respond to the furnaces of life? <br></br>
We make empty promises, saying that God must deliver, <br></br>
Mere feeble attempts to bind God’s will <br></br>
With pledges that we cannot guarantee.
</p>

 <p>
Instead, we are called to be strong and courageous, <br></br>
And if rescue is promised, <br></br>
Then of what value is courage?
</p>

 <p>
Lord, <br></br>
Give us the strength to face the flames <br></br>
Like the three in Babylon, <br></br>
Who dared not promise to show what God would do for them, <br></br>
But promised instead to show what they would do for God.
</p>
