<p>Fast-moving wildfires burning across central and southern Chile have killed at least 18 people and forced large-scale evacuations, with the hardest-hit areas including the Biobío and Ñuble regions about 500 km south of Santiago. President Gabriel Boric declared a “state of catastrophe” (and a state of emergency in some reports), enabling expanded crisis powers and additional resources for response efforts as extreme heat and strong winds helped drive the fires. Authorities and residents described neighborhoods damaged or destroyed, as firefighters battled multiple blazes while evacuation orders moved tens of thousands to safer ground.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/E7i3_mSDvjV7Ga70tJRkjRELYRTqRk-ml8fWSHSyAjhhddOUjnE16Op5Yq9o-dpH9TKR1qv1e9Jv0u5_mKpMwCuL90PSGWrjbwROIS-DTWGd1ylhGdxtY0mvRxXzKBEfIKpLOu9nKOzyfYeTR9rlLp66cqm1X7aQE6zKYyvdOG3bDMYWYtOSIpgj95FHR56ZjiaR0i-46xDYS0YJTjNVEDnfjaafbPPNAIxZT6MPsJTgVxqZZzUZ5jSAiqHNzk1jp0ghmD44Dm9cXzvXZQ' alt='A person walks in front of a burning building as fire and smoke rise from a forest fire in the Biobío region, in Concepción, Chile, January 18, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Curfew ordered: Government measures included ordering a curfew in affected zones as part of emergency controls intended to support evacuations and operations.</li><li>Blazes counted: Officials reported 14 active fires burning over roughly two days in the Ñuble and Biobío regions as response teams worked to contain them.</li><li>Homes destroyed: Authorities said the fires destroyed hundreds of homes while also scorching large areas of forest, compounding the disruption for local communities.</li><li>Mayor’s appeal: A mayor in the Biobío region publicly pressed the national government for more help as flames tore through residential areas.</li><li>Beach escapes: In the port town of Lirquén, some residents sought safety by running to the beach as the fire approached.</li></ul><blockquote>We had to leave with the shirts on our back.
