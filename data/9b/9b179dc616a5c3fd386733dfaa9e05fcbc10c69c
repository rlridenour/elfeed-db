<p>I&rsquo;m trying out the new free <a href="https://www.affinity.studio">Affinity Studio</a>, but so far I&rsquo;m not impressed.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96826/2025/food.jpg" width="600" height="570" alt="Auto-generated description: A bowl of stir-fried tofu with carrots, Brussels sprouts, and green beans, garnished with black sesame seeds.">
<p>The blurry wooden-like fix at the top left is Apple Photos doing its best to hide a piece of paper towel I had in the original photo. To be fair, this is a big chunk of the photo, and this goes beyond &ldquo;repair&rdquo;: it requires AI generation. I do have the tools for that elsewhere, which I might be able to integrate (Affinity now offers AI integration, available as a subscription through Canva, for about the same price as Adobe&rsquo;s Photoshop. No thanks).</p>
<p>The food at the center of the plate looks highly processed, because it is. While Affinity lets me smart-select the food, I need to learn how to blur the mask a bit and merge it more effectively with the background. Still, the exposure adjustment layer in Affinity feels like the dial on it is broken, incapable of soft touches.</p>
