<p>The European Parliament voted to pause its approval process for the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement and asked the EU’s top court to assess whether the pact fits EU treaties and rules. The move, passed by a narrow margin, creates fresh uncertainty for a deal the EU and the Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) had just signed after decades of negotiations. Supporters say the agreement could deepen ties and create a vast trade area, while opponents — including many European farming groups — warn it could expose them to tougher competition from imports.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/NrfOxHYmwFTzT_6IOhL7HVOr3TScsdP6NrWiAbF1ZPr9syKyJPFJYk1V4QE4Isf-Wm4lcT5VUXdkZqu6AzVjfWs_zvLSI471DVDiwXQV86y6K3qm6kSwFJLK9Lh613M111mizw5ExvSmQRxxRVfld0AbJEwkcb_cG6A3uAyQS0MSf9C_WzuSTrKGW0zfW-B5VvU8mWLJq-hEyOphIRAFOOfSm2ON1rK9UfyqHZTu-WKY6reFmv-4' alt='Farmers gather in Strasbourg after the European Parliament voted to send the EU-Mercosur trade pact to the EU’s top court on January 21, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Close vote: MEPs backed the court referral 334–324, with 11 abstentions, underscoring how split the legislature is on the trade pact.</li><li>Farmer protests: Farmers rallied outside the Parliament in Strasbourg beginning Tuesday, with demonstrations continuing overnight into Wednesday as they pressed lawmakers to slow or stop the agreement.</li><li>Procedure dispute: Critics targeted Commission President Ursula von der Leyen over claims the deal was handled in a way that reduced national parliaments’ and the European Parliament’s role, including by splitting it into separate agreements.</li><li>Provisional option: Several outlets report the European Commission may still have the option to provisionally apply the agreement even as the legal review proceeds.</li><li>Germany vs France: France welcomed the referral as consistent with its stance, while Germany criticized the delay and Chancellor Friedrich Merz argued the pact should be provisionally enacted anyway.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Parliament majority (court referral supporters): Supporters of the motion say the EU Court of Justice should verify the agreement’s compatibility with EU treaties before lawmakers proceed with approval.
