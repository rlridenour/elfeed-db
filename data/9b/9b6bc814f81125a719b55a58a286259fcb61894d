<p>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Friday that as of yesterday, new applications for H-1B visas will only be accepted if accompanied by a $100,000 payment.<span id="more-55036"></span></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H-1B visas</a> allow employers to legally hire foreign workers with specialized skills or knowledge to work in the US.</p>
<p>For US universities to hire academics from other countries, they typically must sponsor their visas. The new fee is <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/h-1b-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in addition to</a> any other payments and fees involved in the visa application process, and the policy does not exempt universities, and so now it will cost schools an additional $100,000 to hire foreign scholars.</p>
<p>There remain some uncertainties about the new program, including whether it will be challenged in court, and whether it will be extended beyond its initial year of implementation.</p>
<p>After it was first announced, some universities urged employees with H-1B status who were not in the US to return by midnight on this past Saturday, and issued warnings about travel. Carnegie Mellon University, for example, published a <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/oie/news-and-events/2025-2026/september/h1b-executive-order.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> saying: &#8220;Individuals currently in the United States on an H-1B visa are advised to postpone any plans for international travel. Until the implications and applicability of this new executive order are more fully understood, traveling abroad could pose a significant risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The costs the new policy imposes on universities is likely to affect the US academic job market, and perhaps downstream from that, demand from foreign students for spots in US PhD programs. Discussion welcome.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/09/22/will-us-universities-pay-100000-for-h-1b-visas/">Will US Universities Pay $100,000 for H-1B Visas?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
