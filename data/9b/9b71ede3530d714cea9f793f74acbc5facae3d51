In July, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/apple-sues-jon-prosser-ios-26-leaks/">filed a lawsuit against Jon Prosser and Michael Ramacciotti</a> over alleged theft of the company's trade secrets. The complaint alleged the pair coordinated to break into former Apple software engineer Ethan Lipnik's development iPhone, in order to access and profit off details about iOS 19, which ended up being called iOS 26.<br/>

Prosser leaked various details about what is now known as iOS 26, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGI8sZqWEl0">videos</a> shared on his YouTube channel Front Page Tech. The videos revealed some details about iOS 26's new translucent design, which Apple ended up calling Liquid Glass, months before Apple announced the software update at WWDC 2025 in June.<br/>
<br/>
There have been some developments in the case this week, according to <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70833801/apple-inc-v-ramacciotti/">court documents</a>.<br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday, Ramacciotti's deadline to respond to Apple's complaint was <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.452973/gov.uscourts.cand.452973.13.0.pdf">extended</a> through October 17, as the filing indicates that he only retained a lawyer after the initial August 14 deadline to respond had passed.<br/>
<br/>
On Friday, Apple's lawyers said Prosser had yet to respond to the complaint or otherwise appear in the case. As a result, they have filed a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.452973/gov.uscourts.cand.452973.16.0_1.pdf">request</a> for a default judgment against Prosser, which could result in the assigned judge ruling in Apple's favor and granting it relief. Apple is seeking monetary damages, and an injunction to prevent Prosser and Ramacciotti from further disclosing Apple's confidential information.<br/>
<br/>
Despite not responding to Apple's lawsuit, Prosser has continued to upload videos to YouTube, including an iPhone Air review earlier this week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/11/apple-jon-prosser-lawsuit-latest-updates/">Here&#039;s the Latest on Apple Suing Jon Prosser Over iOS 26 Leaks</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-the-latest-on-apple-suing-jon-prosser-over-ios-26-leaks.2468922/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
