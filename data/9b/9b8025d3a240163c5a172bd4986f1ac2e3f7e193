<p>I fixed another issue I caused myself with my blog: I accidentally switched my blog&rsquo;s theme when I thought what I selected on the back end was just a preview of that theme.</p>
<p>This happens about once a month. A new feature comes hot out of the oven, I want to try it, and I break things. That&rsquo;s how I learn. Micro.blog is a pretty forgiving environment, and I have backups and options to rebuild when this happens. The community is great and Manton himself (the guy who made Micro.blog) usually jumps in to help as well.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean there isn&rsquo;t room for improvement.</p>
<p>Manton has been working hard and keeps improving and adding things to Micro.blog at a pace like never before, anything from polishing up on the dedicated macOS and iOS apps to adding brand new features, like encrypted notes or maybe (in the future) the option to host videos on the platforms. He&rsquo;s a prolific individual who is passionate about what he does, and it&rsquo;s hard to keep track.</p>
<p>I respect Manton, and I love what he does. I&rsquo;ve been working with people who share a similar mindset for years: software engineers, system administrators, and IT managers. My job has been—and to an extent still is—to explain what they do, <em>why</em> they do it, and how it affects their users and community. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do the same for Micro.blog since I joined (one of my earlier attempts has been in my <a href="https://taonaw.gitlab.io/taonah/#Micro.blog">wiki</a>, which is still around, though neglected).</p>
<p>In truth though, I can&rsquo;t keep up with Micro.blog updates. Not with my full-time job and other obligations. By the time I&rsquo;m done working, I don&rsquo;t have much energy left to do even more tech-related stuff and documenting things, but I do want to. I know I can do a decent job at it, and if nothing else, it might help people and make Micro.blog a bit more inviting to non-techie newcomers. I&rsquo;m just not sure how to fit it into my day, and where to start. Do I go back to the wiki? Do I just start on my blog? Do I write documentation on GitLab, as I used to? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
