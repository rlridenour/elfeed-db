Encrypted messaging platform Signal now offers <a href="https://x.com/signalapp/status/1993018186690871409">secure backups on iPhone</a>, letting users save and restore messages if they lose access to their device. <br/>

There are free and paid versions of Signal's secure backups. The free version lets users store up to 100MB of text messages, including photos, videos, and files from the last 45 days.<br/>
<br/>
The paid version costs &#36;1.99 per month and can back up all text messages, along with up to 100GB of media which can be older than 45 days. <br/>
<br/>
The end-to-end encrypted backups can be accessed using a 64-character recovery key generated by the user's device, but keeping the key safe is crucial – if it's lost, Signal can't help users recover their backups.<br/>
<br/>
Enabling secure backups in the Signal app is straightforward: Open the Settings menu and select Backups, then tap Setup ➝ Enable Backups. After a recovery key is generated, users can choose a free or paid plan. <br/>
<br/>
Secure backups first came to Android in <a href="https://x.com/signalapp/status/1965083839576867302">September</a>. Signal says it plans to bring secure backups to its desktop app, and its longer term goal is to allow users to transfer message history between Android, iPhone, and desktop apps.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/signal/">Signal</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/25/signal-secure-backups-for-iphone/">Signal Private Messenger Rolls Out Secure Backups for iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/signal-private-messenger-rolls-out-secure-backups-for-iphone.2471857/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
