<blockquote>
  <p>It was wild to watch. Sure, Neo nearly toppled over while closing
the dishwasher, took two minutes to fold the shirt and twisted its
arm attempting to dance the Macarena. But <em>shhh</em>. Remember the
rule. Oh, did I mention Neo had a human puppet master, controlling
it with a VR headset?</p>

<p>Neo’s creator, 1X Technologies, is making the Rosie-the-Robot
dream: some of the first humanoid housekeepers. Starting Tuesday,
you can apply to its early adopter program and preorder one for
$20,000, with delivery expected in 2026. The company will also
offer a $499 monthly rental plan with a six-month minimum
commitment.</p>

<p>Just one hidden cost: your privacy. For now, you’ll need to be
cool with a company representative potentially peering through the
robot’s camera eyes to get chores done. There are guardrails,
including controls over when and what the operator can do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As usual, Stern made a delightful short film to accompany her article, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3c4mQty_so">also available on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>The argument from CEO Bernt Børnich is that they’re using the videos from the current state of Neo, where its actions are <em>entirely</em> remote-controlled by employees of 1X Technologies, to train its autonomy. I call bullshit. This looks to me like nothing but a scam. It’s not autonomous at all, I don’t believe this company is going to achieve any practical degree of autonomy with this product, and even while it’s remote-controlled by human operators, it’s slow and clumsy.</p>
