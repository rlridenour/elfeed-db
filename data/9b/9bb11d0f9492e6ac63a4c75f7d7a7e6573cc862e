<p>Israel says the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt will resume limited movement of people from Monday, following a “pilot” reopening aimed at testing procedures after a long period of near-closure since May 2024. Officials described the initial phase as pedestrian-only travel, with movements expected in both directions under coordination with Egypt and with oversight linked to an EU mission mechanism referenced by Israel. The step is presented as part of the ceasefire’s next phase, and many residents see Rafah as Gaza’s most direct route to the outside world, including for medical travel. At the same time, several outlets report that key details—such as who qualifies to leave and how many can go—remain unclear, leaving patients and families uncertain about when help will arrive.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uVHsEs1-hjEneorCl11kkQMn-aFQ89pARjQCRe7DcVA1dveB6uCL2wSKoYJF4YJMGe_W1ZwrVUJ1xj56PYSeOFf58jsxmAgR4sT1FgV_e01jmDpqonRHVH7LPJvJPWJA2WSHYSWj390GPltj5DkoSZYJXpUtlts9EycGXY_3BjSnij_U0Ayz7BzGKqaJLFd1zuzV-Dq9R8-C97wU9jSLaexwtdaSD_Lwoc2ODBwoVDtY6qIbarRH4PwmFQkzV5vo1oUAdfd_RRbqX2XJBw' alt='Ambulances and medical personnel amass at the Rafah border crossing waiting to cross from Egypt into Gaza.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Daily capacity: France 24 reported Israel said about 150 people would be able to cross per day during the initial arrangement.</li><li>Returnees waiting: A Palestinian official told Al Jazeera that roughly 80,000 Palestinians who left Gaza are seeking to return via Rafah from Egypt.</li><li>Aid still blocked: Multiple reports say the reopening plan focuses on people, while humanitarian aid and goods are not part of the announced Rafah arrangement at this stage.</li><li>EU monitoring role: The New Arab cited an EU official saying the EU Border Assistance Mission at Rafah (EUBAM) would monitor agreed procedures under earlier arrangements and does not decide whether the crossing opens or closes.</li><li>MSF dispute: Politico and The Globe and Mail reported Israel said it would terminate Doctors Without Borders’ operations in Gaza over a registration-related dispute; MSF said it would not provide staff lists without assurances.</li></ul><blockquote>The Rafah crossing has reopened for movement of people only. - COGAT (Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israel (COGAT): Israel says the Rafah reopening is a pilot to test operations, with pedestrian movement planned in coordination with Egypt and with an EU-supervised mechanism after security clearance.
