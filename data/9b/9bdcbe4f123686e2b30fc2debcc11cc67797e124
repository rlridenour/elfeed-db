A while ago while working on Rust-based Emacs, I was loading a new elisp file and hit a stack overflow. Digging deeper I found the issue in trying to print a cyclic list (where the tail of the list points back to previous element). I knew this was a possibility, and that at some point I would have to handle cycles.
So I quickly implemented a version of Floyd&rsquo;s cycle detection algorithm (visualized here).
