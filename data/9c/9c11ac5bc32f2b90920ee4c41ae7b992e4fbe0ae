As longtime Irreal readers know, I am an Avy fanatic and use it as my principal means of buffer navigation. For a long time, I mostly used <code>avy-goto-word-1</code> but it can only be used to search for the beginning of words. Four years ago, Karthink Chikmagalur published <a href="https://karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/">a post</a> that recommended using <code>avy-goto-char-timer</code> exclusively. For some reason, I ignored his post at the time but a couple of years ago <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=11527">I was reacquainted with his recommendation</a> and resolved to use <code>avy-goto-char-timer</code> more.

One day I suddenly realized that I was, in fact, using it exclusively and couldn&rsquo;t even remember my binding for <code>avy-goto-word-1</code>. It solves the problem of <code>avy-goto-word-1</code> being able to find only the beginning of words.

As the name suggests, <code>avi-goto-char-timer</code> will accept input chars until there&rsquo;s no input for the timeout value. Then it will present a tree of potential targets having those characters. The default timeout value is 0.5 seconds so if you stop typing for half a second, <code>avy-goto-char-timer</code> will present you with a tree of targets.

Lately—perhaps because I mostly work with my laptop on my lap or perhaps because of declining reaction times—I&rsquo;ve found that half a second isn&rsquo;t quite long enough. It often produces suboptimal outcomes, resulting in spurious characters being added to the text in the worst case.

As often happens, I put up with this infelicity for some time before I finally got fed up enough to do something about it. The &ldquo;something&rdquo; in this case was trivial. I simply increased the timeout value to 1.5 seconds. That may be a little long but it seems fine so far. I can, of course, always decrease it a bit if it turns out to hold things up.</p>
