<p>I tried cross compiling in Go for the first time and it’s really amazing how
<code>GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build</code> just works immediately.</p>
<p>Sounds like the one caveat is that things aren&rsquo;t so magical if if you use CGO,
someone linked to <a href="https://github.com/messense/homebrew-macos-cross-toolchains">https://github.com/messense/homebrew-macos-cross-toolchains</a>
which apparently makes that easier on Mac OS.</p>
