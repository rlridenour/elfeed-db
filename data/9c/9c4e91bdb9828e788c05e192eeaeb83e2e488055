Apple intends to equip next year's iPhone 18 Pro models with a variable aperture lens, according to a Chinese leaker with information allegedly sourced from Apple's supply chain.<br/>

According to the Weibo account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Qb3zgwSl7">Digital Chat Station</a>, the main rear camera – what Apple calls the 48-megapixel Fusion camera – on both iPhone 18 Pro models will offer variable aperture, which would be a first for the iPhone. The leaker also claims that the devices' main and telephoto lenses will feature a larger aperture.<br/>
<br/>
A variable-aperture system physically adjusts the lens opening, letting more light in for low-light shots or narrowing the opening for brighter scenes and deeper depth of field. <br/>
<br/>
The main cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro, 16 Pro, and 17 Pro all use a fixed ƒ/1.78 aperture, where the lens is permanently set to its widest setting. With a variable lens, the iPhone 18 Pro would allow users to manually shift the aperture, similar to on a DSLR camera. This would mean more control over depth of field, enabling sharper focus on subjects or smoother background blur.<br/>
<br/>
It isn't the first time we've heard rumors of Apple planning to bring variable aperture to the iPhone. Industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/variable-aperture-rumored-for-iphone-18-pro/">November 2024</a> that Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models will get the feature. <br/>
<br/>
Variable aperture was rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/iphone-17-mechanical-aperture-rumor/">for at least one iPhone 17 model</a>, but it failed to materialize. iPhone 18 Pro models are expected to launch in September 2026.<br/>
