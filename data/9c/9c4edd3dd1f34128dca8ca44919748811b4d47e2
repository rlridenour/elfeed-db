</><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Reflecting on a literary situation presented by Haruki Murakami; and on the often tacit agreements between author and reader.
</p>
        <p><strong>Content Warning: Summarizing fictional violence to animals and people in <cite data-id="kafka-on-the-shore-by-haruki-murakami">Kafka on the Shore</cite> by Haruki Murakami.  Also minor spoilers of midway points of the book.</strong></p>
<p><time datetime="2025-05-22" title="2025-05-22">Last night</time>, I read a few of the early middle chapters of <cite data-id="kafka-on-the-shore-by-haruki-murakami">Kafka on the Shore</cite> by Haruki Murakami.  In one of those chapters, Nakata, a simple-minded man who can
communicate with cats, encounters a demon/devil, named <em>Johnnie Walker</em>, that
ritually kills several paralyzed cats in an effort to instill murderous rage in
Nakata.</p>
<p>The goal of <em>Johnnie Walker</em> is to for Nakata to murder him.  And during this
sequence, <em>Johnnie Walker</em> reminds Nakata of the rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Johnnie Walker</em> will kill each cat unless Nakata intervenes.</li>
<li>Nakata may not turn away, and must watch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading I felt helpless and wanting to set aside the book.  Murakami wrote
details enough to not linger on the brutality but instead move it along at a
real-time pace.  I can see some authors compressing this scene and others
greatly expanding, as though to make the moment last far longer.  Instead
Murakami’s passages pass as though each second spent reading reflected one
second in that gruesome affair.</p>
<p>With <em>Johnnie Walker’s</em> reminder of the rules, I chose to remain engaged.  I felt
myself move along with Nakata, who’s violence ended the slaughter of the cats.
I felt relief as the knife plunged into <em>Johnnie Walker</em>.  Justice served.</p>
<p>I consider some parallels to me the reader and Nakata.  Nakata can communicate
with cats.  This is a unique ability, one that outsiders observe as an old
person speaking to an animal (as I myself do with my dogs).  This private
conversation is akin to me, the reader engaging, with a book.  From an
outsider’s perspective there is little idea of what is transpiring in my private
world.  Reading, being a communication with the author; not quite dialogue but
something more than monologue.</p>
<p>In earlier chapters, we learned of the voice and character of the cats with whom
Nakata spoke.  And the third cat that <em>Johnnie Walker</em> kills is one of those cats.
This connection to a character is the breaking point for Nakata; and I am drawn
along into his violent response, knowing the justifiable nature (after all these
cats are sentient and conversant; in a story no different from a human being).</p>
<p>I felt, that after reading the chapter I needed to breath.  I didn’t stop
reading after that chapter, but instead sought the cleanse of a subsequent
chapter; in which the narrative moves to another focal character.</p>
<p>I write this some 12 hours after the reading.  In part to process, but also
to rationalize my commitment to this story.</p>
<p>I think the the visceral description and setup did what Murakami set out to do
at what I’d consider an inflection point in one of the stories.  Nakata, abides
by the rules and pulled me further into the story.  I <em>trust</em> Murakami to deliver
a tale that will sit with me for the years to come.</p>
<p>In addition, Murakami leaves subtle hints early (cats are disappearing, there’s
a man in a top hat seen around where the cats go missing).  Then more loudly
telegraphs the pending violence; in a description of <em>Johnnie Walker</em> that is
quick to hint at some döppelganger or fey.  Then to really hit home the question
“are you sure you want to proceed?” Nakata opens a freezer and finds several
severed cat heads; each calm with eyes often open.</p>
<p>I also consider that much of our historical fairy tales are brutal and violent
in a similar manner; if perhaps not quite as vividly described.  This is
something that we have collectively lost/removed: the violence of our myriad of
mythos and legendarium.  Sanitized by corporate interests, and now redirected
into bloody action and/or horror flicks or obviated into our summer blockbuster
super hero movies.</p>
<p>In this way I suspect, Murakami is tapping into the bones and sinew of those
stories that I knew of that were just at the edge of a collective memory;
themselves victim to forces of erasure.  A violence of corporate interests
against the collective.</p>
<p>I have played by <em>Johnnie Walker’s</em> rules, not averting my eyes and may pass
through to the next part of the story.  To place that I sense promises
connection to those more visceral myths and stories that rattle and quake near
the edges of my cultural memory.  Some of those older stories resting amongst
the shelves in the room in which I finish this post.</p>
