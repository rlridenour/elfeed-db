Here at Irreal and in many other venues, you hear a lot about staying in Emacs. The hardcore among us treat having to leave Emacs as a fail. To outsiders, it can seem a little obsessive but it all goes back <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12924">to having a uniform interface for dealing with text</a>.

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1k4tuzv/never_get_out_of_emacs_unless_youre_going_all_the/">Here&rsquo;s a delightful meme</a> that expresses that impulse. As usual, the comments are really interesting. For a bit of context—as one of the commenters explains—with CUA the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> selects everything, deletes it, and saves the file; definitely not what you get from Emacs.

It&rsquo;s astounding how many of the commenters say that they&rsquo;ve fallen victim to the same sort of thing. Others complain of deleting browser tabs with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>. One said that he had moved even browsing into Emacs despite its being suboptimal. At least the key bindings do what you expect them to.

There&rsquo;s nothing really profound in the post but it is amusing and, as I said, the comments are interesting. They show that those of us who would prefer to stay in Emacs are not alone.</p>
