<p>Denmark and Greenland say talks with the United States on Arctic security and Greenland’s future have turned more constructive and more direct. But they stress the dispute sparked by President Trump’s push to acquire the autonomous Danish territory is still unresolved, and there is no solution yet. Speaking in Nuuk, Greenland’s Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt welcomed the shift to “direct dialogue” and said the discussions have been respectful. She also cautioned that Greenland is “not where we want to be yet,” and that it is too early to predict where the talks will end up. Denmark and Greenland say they understand US security concerns in the Arctic, but insist Greenland’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/J2Gfp0wgR8B93Kg-xnkw6MxvyTqgVGZELhKH96Iw4xClzcGVtX6-0_N815a0ha0BSjsQ1He_RCPb_b16L01sQSpIksH9eN8xo63CyL_B-Dkn' alt='Danish Foreign Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen, Canada’s Foreign Minister Anita Anand and Greenland’s Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Motzfeldt speak in Nuuk on February 7.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Working group: The US, Denmark and Greenland have set up a working group to discuss Washington’s Arctic security concerns, though they have not made details public.</li><li>Nato framework: Dawn reported that last month Trump backed off threats to seize Greenland after striking a “framework” deal with Nato chief Mark Rutte meant to give the US greater influence.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Denmark (Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen): Rasmussen said there are “no threats on the table,” no trade war with Europe, and that the situation should be handled in a “normal diplomatic way.” He declined to give details about the ongoing talks.
