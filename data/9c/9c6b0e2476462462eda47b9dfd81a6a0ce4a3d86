<p>Many of you reading these words are young or middle-aged academics. Many of you envision yourselves continuing to work or starting careers in academia.<span id="more-54919"></span></p>

<p>When you envision that future, say, ten years down the road, what do you see yourself doing? Assume there is something like higher education, and that you are a professor in philosophy or a related field. What is teaching like? What is research and writing like? What&#8217;s your administration like? What is this huge chunk of your daily existence&#8212;work&#8212;like?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem like it will be very much like how it is today.</p>
<p>Speculating about the future is risky, but not speculating about the future seems riskier. So let&#8217;s speculate a bit.</p>
<p>A lot can happen in ten years. What are some developments that we should factor into our speculations? And how should such speculations affect what we&#8217;re doing now?</p>
<p>Here are just three of the many factors we might pay attention to: artificial intelligence, enrollment, and freedom of expression.</p>
<p><em><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></em></p>
<p>We discuss artificial intelligence (AI) around here a lot, I know, but its effects on academia are already significant and will only continue to grow as the technology develops. We&#8217;ve focused mainly on <a href="https://dailynous.com/?s=teaching+AI">AI&#8217;s effects on teaching</a>, with less on research (though see <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/08/19/the-ethics-of-using-ai-in-philosophical-research/">this post from last month</a>), but perhaps it&#8217;s AI&#8217;s effects on research that may be most consequential for academia.</p>
<p>Over at the <a href="https://justice-everywhere.org/general/can-our-current-academic-model-go-on-in-the-age-of-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Justice Everywhere</em></a> blog, <a href="https://alexvolacu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexandru Volacu</a> (Bucharest) recently wrote about how academics&#8217; use of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI agents</a> in the near future may affect the research aspects of our jobs. He writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>While LLMs can already draft full academic papers, albeit of doubtful quality if not revised, we can probably expect that AI agents will be able to do genuinely in-depth research with minimal input, including generating new ideas, going over all relevant literature, writing in a particular style, formulating and answering objections, revising the text until it mirrors ordinary academic writing, and so forth&#8230; It seems likely, then, that AI tools capable of writing in a manner indistinguishable from academics will at some point be available, and it is likely that this point is not decades away, but rather years away.</em></p>
<p>He then describes why a world in which you can have &#8220;a new AI-generated article&#8230; at your fingertips with minimal effort,&#8221; but which also retains our current &#8220;publish or perish&#8221; research model, would be disastrous, &#8220;turning the scientific community into a landscape marred by profound unfairness&#8230; and clogging research fields altogether, since the peer-review process (already heavily strained) would become completely unsustainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volacu&#8217;s comments are a good prompt for thinking about academic research in a world of AI, but they are also a good example of what to guard against in prognosticating: imagining one thing changing and everything else remaining the same. We might wonder, for example: if at some point in the future AI agents are able to write competent academic papers, might AI agents also then be able to write competent referee reports? And what would the effects of competent AI &#8220;peer reviewers&#8221; be on our research ecosystem?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just one question on one aspect of one part of academic labor, looking at things from inside the academy, in a manner of speaking.</p>
<p>We can look at them from outside, too: what will the demand for higher education look like in a world in which AI is doing a lot of the work that makes up the careers our current students hope to pursue, and how will that effect what we teach?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots more here, of course.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enrollment Declines</em></strong></p>
<p>Between economic changes and the &#8220;<a href="https://www.highereddive.com/news/demographic-cliff-colleges-closures-retention-attendance-diversity-wiche/743636/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demographic cliff</a>&#8220;, institutions of higher education are facing the prospects of declining enrollment (and not everyone who enrolls ends up <a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/completing-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sticking around to graduate</a>).</p>
<p>We&#8217;re assuming, for the sake of this exercise, that ten years from now you have a job as an academic. But what is your employer doing to maintain its share of a shrinking student population? And how is that affecting your job?</p>
<p>Has your college turned in a more vocational-training direction, as many struggling schools seem to be doing today? Has it substantially partnered with, or been taken over by, a corporation?</p>
<p>Or is your school hoping to stand out by focusing on the liberal arts and marketing itself as an institution of <a href="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/philosophy-your-life.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-cultivation</a>? Or what?</p>
<p>Is your university saving money by abandoning in-person courses and relying on newer communication technology instead? Are you teaching more courses? What are the trendy learning outcomes the administration is insisting you put on your syllabus? Do you have an office?</p>
<p><em><strong>Academic Freedom &amp; Freedom of Speech</strong></em></p>
<p>Charlie Kirk created the <a href="https://dailynous.com/2016/11/23/philosophers-professor-watchlist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Watchlist</a>, and his murder last week&#8212;of course&#8212;has only strengthened the attitudes that gave rise to that list, encouraged clamp downs on academic freedom and freedom of speech, and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5506688-trump-administration-charlie-kirk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emboldened those in power</a> to punish people for expressing views they do not like, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/charlie-kirk-death-university-firing-suspension" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including academics</a>.</p>
<p>More generally, there seems to be, among politicians and the general population, much less of an appreciation of the value of freedom of expression in general than there ought to be. Some <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/04/24/free-expression-seen-as-important-globally-but-not-everyone-thinks-their-country-has-press-speech-and-internet-freedoms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> on this is ambiguous, but it does show that support for freedom of expression rises with level of education. It also shows that support among students for &#8220;using violence to stop a speaker&#8221; has risen over time. Here&#8217;s a chart from a recent <a href="https://www.thefire.org/news/student-acceptance-violence-response-speech-hits-record-high" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-54997 aligncenter" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fire-survey-violence-to-stop-speaker.png" alt="" width="852" height="511" srcset="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fire-survey-violence-to-stop-speaker.png 852w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fire-survey-violence-to-stop-speaker-300x180.png 300w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fire-survey-violence-to-stop-speaker-768x461.png 768w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fire-survey-violence-to-stop-speaker-400x240.png 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" /></p>
<p>Not all those who think it&#8217;s &#8220;ever acceptable&#8221; to use violence to stop a speaker would not actually do it. According to the <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/reports/college-student-views-on-free-expression-and-campus-speech-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knight Foundation</a>, only 8% percent of students in the US say they would &#8220;engage in disruptive actions&#8212;either trying to stop a speech ahead of time or disrupt it during&#8212;to halt a speaker they oppose,&#8221; and of course &#8220;disrupt&#8221; does not necessarily mean &#8220;use violence.&#8221; Still, averaging across party affiliations, one in three students say the use of such violence could be acceptable.</p>
<p>Violence is not the only threat to freedom of speech. One might worry that if so many think violence can be an acceptable way to stop a speaker, many more would find acceptable restrictive policies on, or practices of firing people for, what today in the US we could consider Constitutionally-protected speech.</p>
<p>If the norms and attitudes supporting freedom of expression and academic freedom erode further, how will that affect your job a decade down the road? What will teaching and research be like under those conditions?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #d4d2d2;">*</span>  <span style="color: #808080;">*</span>  *  <span style="color: #808080;">*</span>  <span style="color: #d4d2d2;">*</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The foregoing is rather limited in scope. Discussion of other important factors is encouraged. </span></p>
<p>It also <span style="color: #000000;">suggests a pessimistic-looking picture of academia ten years down the road, but I welcome&#8212;long for, really&#8212;speculation that is more positive in outlook, too. </span></p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/09/17/what-will-be-like-academic-ten-years/">What Will It Be Like To Be An Academic In Ten Years?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
