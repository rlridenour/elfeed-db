Users can expect significantly better selfies, especially in low-light conditions. The improvement is one of the biggest upgrades to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s front-facing camera ever. The history of major upgrades to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s front-facing camera is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 4</strong> (2010): 0.3-megapixels</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 5</strong> (2012): 1.2-megapixels</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 6S</strong> (2015): 5-megapixels</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 7</strong> (2016): 7-megapixels</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 12</strong> (2020): 12-megapixels</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 17</strong> (2025): 18-megapixels</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The new 18-megapixel camera is present on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max. The only iPhones still on sale with a camera below 18-megapixels are the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus which retain a 12-megapixel camera. <br/>
<br/>
The new front-facing camera features Center Stage for the first time, keeping the user in frame during video calls. It also enables ultra-stabilized video in 4K HDR. In addition, users can record on the front and rear cameras simultaneously with Dual Capture. <br/>
<br/>
The sensor is square, which is a first for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, allowing users to take photos and videos in portrait or landscape while holding their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; vertically.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2025-apple-event/">September 2025 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/new-iphones-feature-18mp-front-camera/">All New iPhone Models Feature 18MP Front-Facing Camera With Center Stage and Square Sensor</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-new-iphone-models-feature-18mp-front-facing-camera-with-center-stage-and-square-sensor.2464994/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
