<p>Bangladeshis began voting Thursday, February 12, in a high-stakes parliamentary election widely framed as the country’s first genuinely competitive national poll in years. The vote follows the 2024 student-led uprising that ousted long-time leader Sheikh Hasina. Nearly 128 million people are eligible to vote. The Awami League is out of the race after the Election Commission suspended its registration. Voting opened at 7:30 a.m. under heavy security, with police and army personnel visibly deployed at polling sites. The main contest pits a Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led bloc, associated with leader Tarique Rahman, against an 11-party coalition led by Jamaat-e-Islami under Shafiqur Rahman. Opinion polling cited by multiple outlets has suggested an edge for the BNP. Many voters and analysts describe the day as a test of whether the post-uprising transition can turn street demands into functioning institutions—especially on corruption, jobs, governance, and free expression—after months of unrest that disrupted parts of the economy. Some reports also flagged tensions on the ground, including clashes between supporters of Jamaat and the BNP in Dhaka’s Mirpur area, even as many voters said they hope their ballots will finally “matter” again. Beyond domestic politics, several sources say the next government could reset Bangladesh’s foreign-policy balance—especially among India, China, and the United States—after ties between Dhaka and New Delhi frayed sharply in 2024.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/pC2yWJyeBm3lHcwe1rv0Gs5f5_FG_QPp9wpEpSAdD40eExFnrhJbIJHA69z8OEjfGCxeItaXYlQeQDEtuXjowfM0mPb_Z0vCRMKgeOQAkSp4' alt='A voter casts her ballot at a polling station during Bangladesh’s general election in Dhaka, February 12, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Referendum ballot: Firstpost’s live updates reported that voters are also deciding an 84-point reform referendum alongside the parliamentary election.</li><li>Youth weight: About 28% of Bangladesh’s population is aged 15–29, a demographic expected to play an outsized role after leading the 2024 uprising that prompted the election.</li><li>Election break: The Hindu reported the vote is being held during a four-day national holiday and is scheduled to run until 4:30 p.m..</li><li>Clean politics pledge: Tarique Rahman told The Guardian he would pursue a “top down, no tolerance” approach to graft if the BNP comes to power.</li><li>Geopolitics and trade: Semafor reported that Washington plans to offer the next government alternatives to Chinese military systems and said the U.S. lowered tariffs on Bangladesh in a new trade deal this week.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Interim government (Muhammad Yunus): Interim Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus cast his ballot in Dhaka, and Firstpost’s live blog said he called election day the “birthday of new Bangladesh.” (<a href='https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-elections-2026-voting-updates-vote-counting-polls-results-bnp-ncp-jamaat-led-alliance-sheikh-hasina-nation-casts-ballots-in-first-poll-since-sheikh-hasinas-ouster-liveblog-13978771.html'>Firstpost</a>)</li><li>Jamaat-e-Islami (Shafiqur Rahman): Shafiqur Rahman said he would accept the verdict if the polls are fair, according to The Hindu’s live coverage.
