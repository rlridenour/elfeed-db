<p>I finally got a significant <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a> update out. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==highlight==</code> rendering, and a BYO JavaScript setup I think (some) users will like.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2021/04/marked2icon.png"></p>
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s become so popular, but I&rsquo;ve received a lot of requests for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==highlight==</code> rendering. So I&rsquo;ve added it as an option. I also added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~~deletion~~</code> rendering, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~underline~</code> as an additional option. I had to make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~underline~</code> function separately as it conflicts with MultiMarkdown&rsquo;s subscript syntax. But you can find all of these options under Settings-&gt;Processor. There&rsquo;s even an option to convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==highlights==</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~~deletions~~</code> to CriticMarkup, which allows for a nicer display in Marked.</p>

<p>Next, I&rsquo;ve had requests for <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid diagramming</a> for a long time. I&rsquo;ve had fewer requests for including arbitrary JavaScript in the preview, but I figured if I was going to start adding JS libraries, I might as well make it as flexible as possible.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/03/additionalscripts.jpg"></p>

<p>If you look under Settings-&gt;Style, you&rsquo;ll find an <strong>Additional Scripts</strong> button. This will open a panel where you can control what JS is loaded in every preview (<a href="https://marked2app.com/help/Embedding_Scripts.html">docs</a>). Mermaid has its own checkbox, and if I add additional library support, checkboxes will be added here. Below that is a 3-pane field where you can add JavaScript from local files, CDN urls, or embed raw text.</p>

<p>Note that when adding libraries, you&rsquo;re responsible for making them update. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Marked.hooks</code> API allows you to hook a render function into the update call, so every time the preview updates (which is not a full refresh), you can trigger whatever rendering needs to happen. See <a href="https://marked2app.com/help/Embedding_Scripts.html#hooks">the docs</a> for details on that.</p>

<p>There are a <a href="https://marked2app.com/help/changelog.html#version2.6.451068">few other fixes</a>. I published a second update this morning (<a href="https://marked2app.com/help/changelog.html#version2.6.461071">v2.6.46</a>) that improves multi-line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==highlight==</code> rendering, and finally allows you to customize the reading speed for Reading Time calculations. That&rsquo;s available right now for direct (Paddle) customers and in review for Setapp and MAS customers.</p>
