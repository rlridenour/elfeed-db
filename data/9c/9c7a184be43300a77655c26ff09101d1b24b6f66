Apple will make its artificial intelligence models available to developers to use in their apps, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/apple-to-open-ai-models-to-developers-betting-that-it-will-spur-new-apps">Bloomberg</a></em>. The company plans to introduce a new software development kit (SDK) in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a> that will make it easier for app creators to add AI features.<br/>

The SDK will feature the same large language models that Apple is using for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features like notification summaries, Writing Tools, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, but Apple will first focus on the smaller models that are able to run on-device.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has faced criticism for its failure to deliver &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> features in a timely manner. Apple announced a new personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; experience at WWDC 2024 and intended to release the new capabilities as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, but the functionality <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">was not ready in time</a> and is now being held until &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Some of Apple's other features, like Writing Tools and &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, haven't seen widespread adoption. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple is hoping that opening up its AI models to developers will provide use cases that better attract consumers. Currently, developers can integrate notification summaries, Writing Tools, &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;, and &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; into their apps, but they aren't able to create new AI features using Apple's framework. Instead, developers who want to include AI integrate third-party models, which Apple is aiming to change.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's AI announcements will come at the Worldwide Developers Conference, which is set to take place on Monday, June 9.<br/>

Apple has also been working on in-house large language models (LLMs), and eventually the company plans to introduce a version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that relies on LLMs and is more like ChatGPT, Claude, and other chatbots. The LLM version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; isn't expected until 2026 at the earliest, and it will likely be part of iOS 20.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/ios-19-apple-ai-models-developers/">iOS 19 Will Let Developers Use Apple&#039;s AI Models in Their Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-19-will-let-developers-use-apples-ai-models-in-their-apps.2457408/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
