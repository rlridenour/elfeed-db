<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I did a video on the Getting Things Done (GTD) trigger list a while back. (And why I love it so!)</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These days, the verb &#8220;trigger&#8221; has taken on a negative connotation. Nobody wants to be triggered, and triggering others is considered </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">bad</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> form. But there is a good kind of triggering: triggering yourself to remember tasks and projects that have just slipped out of your mind.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The GTD trigger list is a long list of items you can easily read over to trigger memories about things you need to do. </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can download the trigger lists </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mind_Sweep_Trigger_List.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">here</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It&#8217;s a simple and effective tool for managing your tasks. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Projects you&#8217;ve committed</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Projects not yet undertaken</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Todo items that slipped your mind</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Correspondence to send out</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Things you wanted to look into</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> as you scan over that list, you&#8217;ll be amazed by how much slips your mind over an ordinary week. The GTD trigger list is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance your productivity and ensure that nothing important gets lost in the shadows.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How can you use the trigger list to marshal your </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">important</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> tasks? Download the PDF from the link I shared above and start reading the triggers. You&#8217;ll be amazed by how many tasks and commitments come to the front of your mind. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Then</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">write down the items that come to you.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> (You can organize them into their proper contexts later.)</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Honestly, it&#8217;s easier to forget these kinds of things. And there&#8217;s a reason these chores fall out of your head: it seems </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">easier</span> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">in</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the moment to walk around in a fog and think you&#8217;re being productive. Don&#8217;t let your life linger in the shadows. </span></p>
