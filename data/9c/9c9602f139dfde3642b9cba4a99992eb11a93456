<p id="p1">I enjoyed this thought-provoking piece by (<a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2025-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#best-new-app" rel="noopener noreferrer">award-winning developer</a>) Matt Birchler, <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/llms-have-made-simple-software-trivial/" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing for Birchtree</a> on how he’s been making so-called “<a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/2026l-the-year-of-micro-apps/" rel="noopener noreferrer">micro apps</a>” with AI coding agents:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  I was out for a run today and I had an idea for an app. I busted out my own app, Quick Notes, and dictated what I wanted this app to do in detail. When I got home, I created a new project in Xcode, I committed it to GitHub, and then I gave Claude Code on the web those dictated notes and asked it to build that app.</p>
<p>  About two minutes later, it was done…and it had a build error.

<p id="p3">And:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  As a simple example, it’s possible the app that I thought of could already be achieved in some piece of software someone’s released on the App Store. Truth be told, I didn’t even look, I just knew exactly what I wanted, and I made it happen. This is a quite niche thing to do in 2026, but what if Apple builds something that replicates this workflow and ships it on the iPhone in a couple of years? What if instead of going to the App Store, they tell you to just ask Siri to make you the app that you need?

<p id="p5">John and I are going to discuss this on the next episode of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/podcasts/appstories/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStories</a> about the second part of the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/podcasts/appstories/episodes/467" rel="noopener noreferrer">experiments</a> we did over our holiday break. As I’ll mention in the episode, I ended up building <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/viticci.macstories.net/post/3mc5urpw26223" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 web apps</a> for things I have to do every day, such as appending text to Notion just how I like it or controlling my TV and <a href="https://amzn.to/4bw7m9O" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hue sync box</a>. I didn’t even <em>think</em> to search the App Store to see if new utilities existed: I “built” (or, rather, <em>steered</em> the building of) my own progressive web apps, and I’m using them every day. As Matt argues, this is a very niche thing to do right now, which requires a terminal, lots of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents" rel="noopener noreferrer">scaffolding</a> around each project, and deeper technical knowledge than the average person who would just prompt “make me a beautiful todo app.” But the direction seems clear, and the timeline is accelerating.</p>
<p id="p6">I also can’t help but remember <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/17/apple-wanted-people-to-vibe-code-vision-pro-apps-with-siri/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this old rumor from 2023</a> about Apple exploring the idea of letting users rely on Siri to create apps on the fly for the then-unreleased Vision Pro. If only the guy in charge of the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/bloomberg-reports-that-apple-is-shaking-up-siri-leadership/" rel="noopener noreferrer">went anywhere</a> and Apple <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-confirms-ai-partnership-with-google/" rel="noopener noreferrer">got their hands</a> on a <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/developers-tools/gemini-3-developers/" rel="noopener noreferrer">pretty good model for vibe-coding</a>, right?</p>
