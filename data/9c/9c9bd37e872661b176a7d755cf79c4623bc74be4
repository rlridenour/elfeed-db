The store has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/apple-store-revamps-long-island-and-fairfax/">closed since November</a>, with Apple operating out of a temporary location on the west side of the shopping mall until the renovations are completed. Apple has yet to share an exact date for the grand re-opening.<br/>
<br/>
Roosevelt Field is the largest mall on Long Island. Apple first opened its store there in 2002, months after the original iPod launched. When the store reopens, it will feature a modern design with more wood, as Apple has moved away from stainless steel walls. Many of its newer stores also offer an Apple Pickup station for online orders.<br/>

Elsewhere in the U.S., Apple is working on a few other store projects. <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/thegalleria/">Apple The Galleria</a> in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/baybrook/">Apple Baybrook</a>, outside of Houston, Texas, remain under renovation, and we are still waiting on a grand opening date for the all-new <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/downtowndetroit/">Apple Downtown Detroit</a> store that the company teased back in February.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/26/new-apple-store-coming-soon-on-long-island/">New Apple Store Coming Soon on Long Island</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-store-coming-soon-on-long-island.2459733/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
