</ul><h1>Stay In Charge</h1><p>Many of us spend hours glued to our phones or computers when we’re home.</p>
<p>But let’s be real: the stuff we’re doing on our devices day-to-day is pretty low energy. Scrolling Reddit, checking email, listening to a podcast, messaging with our friends–none of those things are nuking the battery on their own.</p>
<p>And again, this is when we’re at home. Outlets galore. Probably multiple cables and charging blocks, a few charging pads, et cetera.</p>
<p>But then, vacation time rolls around, and I don’t know about you, but I go berserk on stuff to keep myself entertained on the plane ride.</p>
<p>It might only take about five hours from when I get to the gate to when I catch my ride on the other end. And yet, I’m downloading two seasons of a show, a movie, and, like, five new games across my phone, my laptop, and my tablet.</p>
<p>In other words, this is when I’m on the move, where outlet access is limited.</p>
<p>And yes, every time I go to the airport, the outlets seem to have multiplied. And yes, even in the planes themselves, I’ll usually find something to plug into. But what about when I’m walking through the terminal, huh? What about when I only have a cable that ends in USB-C? Point is: you never know.</p>
<p>Is this ironic? That we (or at least I) use the apps that burn the most battery when I’m less likely to have outlet access?</p>
<p>Maybe. Maybe not. Only Alanis knows for sure.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is that it’s inconvenient when you’re at the outset of a long flight (or bus ride, or whatever) and you find your battery hovering around 22% with nowhere to charge in sight.</p>
<p>That’s why you need these.</p>
<p>They’re 20,000mAh power banks that can charge your phone, your tablet, and even your laptop. Each one has two USB-A ports and one USB-C. Also, they’re not shaped like cameras. So, we’re sorry. Or, you’re welcome.</p>
<p>Point is: they’re power banks. And owning power banks is good. Because they charge stuff.</p>
<p>So buy a couple power banks. And charge stuff.</p>
