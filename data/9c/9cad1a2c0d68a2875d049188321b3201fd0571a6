As per the <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12591856-chatgpt-atlas-release-notes">release notes</a>, the latest build introduces tab groups, allowing users to organize their browsing sessions more efficiently. The update also brings fixes for vertical tab "mini mode" and a simplified right-click context menu for tabs.<br/>
<br/>
On the search front, Atlas now features an "Auto" mode that automatically switches between ChatGPT and Google depending on the query. The search results UI has also been refreshed with a new vertical layout that more prominently displays links in answers.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in this update, Safari users migrating to Atlas will now be prompted to install the iCloud passwords extension during onboarding. Other changes include a simplified address bar context menu, crash fixes, updated translations, and support for macOS keyboard text replacements on webpages.<br/>
<br/>
Today's update follows the browser's first major update that came in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/20/chatgpt-atlas-update-vertical-tabs/">November</a>. That introduced vertical tabs, iCloud Passkey support, and Google as a default search engine option.<br/>
<br/>
Atlas currently remains available only on macOS, but OpenAI has said Windows, iOS, and Android versions are coming.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/22/chatgpt-atlas-update-adds-tab-groups/">ChatGPT Atlas Gains Tab Groups, Auto Google/AI Search Switching</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chatgpt-atlas-gains-tab-groups-auto-google-ai-search-switching.2476427/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
