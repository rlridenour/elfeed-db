The iconic "Reflection" ringtone – introduced in 2017 alongside the iPhone X – now has multiple alternate versions in iOS 26. While the original tone retains its familiar pellucid xylophone melody, the following new variants bring different energies to the classic:<br/>
<ul><li>Buoyant</li><br/>
<li>Dreamer</li><br/>
<li>Pond</li><br/>
<li>Pop</li><br/>
<li>Reflected</li><br/>
<li>Surge</li></ul><br/>
You can find and select the new ringtones in <strong>Settings ➝ Sound & Haptics ➝ Ringtone</strong>. Tap the chevron next to Reflection to expand the list and reveal the new versions.<br/>
<br/>
The new versions keep Reflection's signature rhythm but each adds its own character and beat. Like the original, they can be used as both a ringtone and an alarm sound. You can listen to the new Reflection mixes yourself right now by hitting play on the embedded X post below.<br/>

In an extra Easter egg, Apple also added a new ringtone called <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1954971092164198413">Little Bird</a>, which is distinct from the new Reflection options. <br/>
