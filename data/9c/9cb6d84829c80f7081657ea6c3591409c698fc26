With this you can readily search an entire project directory for some text, and then make whole-scale changes to any or all files containing that text. I assume you already have helm-projectile installed and you use it; if not, you&rsquo;re missing out!
 First, install wgrep and helm-wgrep, for which I use use-package and my emacs.el init file:  (use-package wgrep :ensure t :config (use-package wgrep-helm :ensure t))  Then, execute helm-projectile-grep for the text you desire.
