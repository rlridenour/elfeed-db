<p>Oliver Darcy, writing at Status (paywalled — great content, terrible CMS experience that keeps logging me out on all my devices and requires a stupid email magic link to get back in), in a brief interview with Atlantic editor-in-chief and man of the moment Jeffrey Goldberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It goes without saying that there are many ironies associated with
this particular story. One of them is that Goldberg, a journalist
who Donald Trump loathes for his past reporting (remember the
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/">“suckers and losers” piece</a>), somehow became the unintended
recipient of high-level, real-time military intelligence from
inside his own inner circle. One wonders whether any heads will
roll as a result of the whole matter. On Monday, Trump again made
his disdain for Goldberg known, blasting him at a press conference
and absurdly claiming The Atlantic is “a magazine that is going
out of business.”</p>

<p>If anything, of course, publishing a story like the one Goldberg
did on Monday proves how strong the outlet currently is. That type
of muscular journalism requires skill, strong leadership, and the
backing of a courageous publisher. I asked Goldberg about owner
Laurene Powell Jobs’ role in the matter. He declined to comment
specifically on this particular story, but offered words of
praise: “Laurene Powell Jobs is a stalwart and brave publisher at
a time when cowardice rules the day.”</p>

<p>If it had been a Washington Post reporter who was inadvertently included on the Trump national security team’s Signal group chat, would they have run the story? No fucking way with that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/journalism_requires_owners_committed_to_the_cause">abject lickspittle coward Jeff Bezos</a> running the show.</p>
