For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.gridstudio.cc/">GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. GRID Studio is known for taking non-operational Apple devices that would be cluttering up a landfill and turning them into <a href="https://www.gridstudio.cc/collections/all">stylish art for Apple fans</a>.<br/>

GRID Studio takes apart iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple accessories, cleverly displaying each component to provide a look inside Apple's most iconic products. The pieces are arranged in a frame and accompanied by labels and little tidbits of Apple history.<br/>
<br/>
The company is offering a flash sale this weekend, with up to 50 percent off a range of products. The GRID 1, featuring the <a href="https://www.gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">well-known first-generation iPhone</a>, for example, is available for &#36;299, which is a &#36;100 discount off of the typical price.<br/>
<br/>
The original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is one of Apple's most recognizable devices, and it is the ideal piece to get because it was such an important part of Apple's history. The GRID 1 features all of the internal components from the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, from the home button to the chassis.<br/>
<br/>
For something more affordable, the <a href="https://www.gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-6plus">GRID 6 Plus</a>, featuring the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 Plus, is just &#36;99 during the sale. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 Plus was Apple's first larger-sized &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, sold alongside the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6. It is perhaps best known for being the subject of the major "bendgate" controversy because the chassis could become distorted in a pocket.<br/>

The GRID 13, <a href="https://www.gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-13">available for &#36;179</a>, features Apple's more modern &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13. The GRID 13 shows off the newer, flat-edged chassis that Apple introduced with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, a logic board with the A15 chip, and a range of components like the Taptic Engine and the TrueDepth camera system.<br/>
