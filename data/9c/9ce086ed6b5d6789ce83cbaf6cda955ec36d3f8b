Tennis fans can view live scores for Grand Slam and 1000 tournaments, and track current and previous men's and women's singles matches.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Sports supports the Live Activities feature, and that extends to tennis scores. This means you can view live tennis scores at a glance on an iPhone's Lock Screen, and in the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 14 Pro and newer.<br/>
<br/>
The app has also gained a revamped "Home" section. Apple says matchups and events are now grouped by league, and there are expanded controls for fans to order them how they prefer. Favorite/starred teams always appear at the top.<br/>
<br/>
Last, you can now view pitcher and batter matchups at the top of every scoreboard.<br/>
<br/>
Launched in February 2024, the Apple Sports app shows scores, stats, standings, upcoming games, and more for a variety of leagues. The free app is currently available on the iPhone only, in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada.<br/>
