<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Revisiting a wise and reflective post by Tracy Durnell; and from there better managing how I engage with my feed reading.

        <p>At the <time datetime="2025-02" title="2025-02">beginning of February</time> I read <a href="https://birming.com/fabruary/">Fabruary: Share a Fabulous Blog Post</a> and set
a calendar reminder to follow-up.</p>
<h2 id="what-got-me-thinking">What Got Me Thinking</h2>
<p>Tracy Durnell’s <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/02/23/choosing-my-pace-by-shaping-my-thinking-spaces/">Choosing my pace by shaping my thinking spaces (Part 5)</a> post got
me thinking.  In <time datetime="2025-02-24" title="2025-02-24">late February</time> I sent her an email with the following:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

<p>Good evening Tracy,</p>
<p>In reading &ldquo;Choosing my pace by shaping my thinking spaces (Part 5)&rdquo;, I
was thinking about this passage:</p>
<p>“I am starting to unsubscribe from a few feeds, though I am reluctant to
remove too many 😉 I am thinking of creating a second RSS feed for myself
on a different service, subscribing only to my favorite 20-30 feeds; I
can check that during the week, and on weekends, when I have a bit more
capacity, can take a peek at my full feed to see if there’s anything I
missed. (A lot of times, news seems to play itself out over the span of a
week.)”</p>
<p>I don’t know what you use for your Feed Reader.  I started adopting this
principle with Elfeed (in Emacs).  Namely I have a default search filter
for my feed.  I still fetch everything, I just don’t, by default see
everything.</p>
<p>I have different search filters, which allow me to see the feed from
different views.  For example, I auto-tag a few feeds as “skip”. And
that is omitted from my default filter.  However, I can then filter
specifically on “skip” to revisit.</p>
<p>I also have set my default filter to only show articles from the last 2
days.  Anything else will not be seen (unless I remove that filter).</p>
<p>I have found that this works, and wonder if your feed reader supports
auto-tagging feed sources and bookmarking different filters?</p>
<p>Regardless, thank you for thinking outloud.  You invariably prompt me
towards further thinking.</p>

<p>This email set my subconscious thinking.</p>
<h2 id="fabruary-entry">Fabruary Entry</h2>
<p><time datetime="2025-03-01" title="2025-03-01">This morning</time> I sent Robert Birming my entry.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

<p>The month of February has been a flurry, one of many lived lifetimes it
seems.  I think to Tracy Durnell&rsquo;s post <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/02/23/choosing-my-pace-by-shaping-my-thinking-spaces/">Choosing my pace by shaping my
thinking spaces (Part 5)</a></p>
<p>With the following passage, Tracy highlights the stakes of media
consumption:</p>
<p>“Controlling the pace of media becomes a tool of power, with political
ramifications. If we’re busy watching, we’re not acting. If we’re stuck
listening, we’re not thinking. If we’re not sure what’s happening, we’ll
wait to gather more information. If we’re constantly playing catch up,
we’re always in reactive mode, never proactive.”</p>
<p>This systemic strategy dovetails with ideas of perfectionism; we must
have complete information before we can act.  We can&rsquo;t do something
unless we do it right.  &ldquo;Be an informed consumer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one hand Neo-liberalism demands that we &ldquo;do more with less&rdquo; but
there&rsquo;s a corollary; we have more &ldquo;news&rdquo; so we &ldquo;do less when there&rsquo;s
more.&rdquo;  And Tracy articulates this so well in her meditation on
recognizing the gluttonous buffet that is available for us to consume.</p>


</blockquote>

<p>I had chosen a different passage to highlight for the entry, but it triggered my
subconscious to nudge my mind a bit to make some <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" title="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-RSS">&#128214;</a></small>
 feed changes.</p>
<h2 id="i-thought-about-it">I Thought About It</h2>
<p>I spent just a bit of time reflecting on the situation.  Here are notes from my
journal:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

<p>I want to organize my feed a bit better.  Namely to auto-tag feeds around
frequency.</p>
<p>How might that look?</p>
<p>First there is a default search; these are things I don’t want to miss.
Inconsistently tagged <code>everything</code>.  Maybe rename those to <code>daily</code>.  Things I want
to see each day.</p>
<p>Then look to assign longer frequencies?  <code>weekly</code> and <code>monthly</code> This implies I would
look at them at those points in time.  These tags obfuscate what they are,
namely personal priorities.  First, read these.  Then these.  Then these.  So,
an ordinality.</p>
<p>And this has me considering my Mastodon interaction.  The place of
doom-scrolling.</p>


</blockquote>

<p>With those notes, I set about making some changes.</p>
<h2 id="prioritizing-the-feeds">Prioritizing the Feeds</h2>
<p>I spent an hour prioritizing each feed.  Marking them as either 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
or 4th.  I also added an “outlet” tag for those sites that blast quite a lot of
content.</p>
<p>While prioritizing, I wrote a function to sort the <span><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" title="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ORG-MODE">&#128214;</a></small>
 document I use for
managing my <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>
 feed.  I found the sorting useful as I knew I could easily skip
entries I couldn’t categorize in the moment.</p>

  &quot;The priorities and their index&quot;)

(defun jf/org-sort-entries/by-elfeed-tag-priority ()
  &quot;Sort org entries by elfeed tag priority.&quot;
  (interactive)
  (org-sort-entries
    nil
    ?f
    (lambda ()
      (format &quot;%s-%s&quot;
        ;; Find the priority elfeed tag.
        (or
          (cl-position
            (car
              (cl-intersection
                (org-element-property :tags (org-element-at-point))

        ;; And the title.
        (org-element-property :title (org-element-at-point))))
    #'string&lt;))
</code></pre>
<p>While working on that I realized that I could consolidate my feed sources.
Prior to <time datetime="2025-03-01" title="2025-03-01">today</time> I had a Private and Public set of sources.  The public I exported
as <a href="https://takeonrules.com/blogroll.xml">my Blogroll</a>.  The other I did not export.</p>
<p>I do not want to export everything I subscribe to, so this required a
modification to the function I was using.  Namely <a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs/blob/02611d341bfba82816196f5faf6777e21e3f7bad/emacs.d/init.el#L8038-L8039">adding a conditional to an
existing function from another package</a>.</p>
<h2 id="applying-the-filter">Applying the Filter</h2>
<p>And last, I created a function with some pre-defined filters to help me pick my
reading context.</p>

    (setq elfeed-search-filter
          (alist-get filter filters nil nil #'string=))
    (elfeed-search-update :force)))

<p>The four filters are as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>First (1st)</dt>
<dd>Show me the unread first priorities; regardless of how old they
are.</dd>
<dt>Second (2nd)</dt>
<dd>Show me the unread second priorities that are from the last 7
days.</dd>
<dt>Third (3rd)</dt>
<dd>Show me the unread third priorities from the last week.</dd>
<dt>Outlets</dt>
<dd>Show me those “we’re blasting you with stuff” from the last 2 days.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My goal with this work is to better realize what I was learning from Tracy;
namely to reduce the pace of information.  And this <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
 programming I did
helps improve the conditions for me to slow that pace.</p>
<p>That is, as I look at what’s coming at me, I can adjust and reflect.  Demoting
feeds to lower priorities, and by implication less often read.</p>
<p>And those base-line filters are a work in progress.  Maybe the date range isn’t
quite right.  But it’s something with which to experiment.</p>
