<p>France’s National Assembly in Paris approved the 2026 social security financing bill by a margin of 247 votes to 234 on Tuesday, handing recently appointed Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu a vital but fragile victory in a hung parliament. The measure, which includes suspending a previously planned increase in the legal retirement age for some workers, still needs further scrutiny in the Senate before returning to the lower house, so the government’s financial plans are not yet fully secured. All deputies from President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party backed the text, while many conservatives from Les Républicains either abstained or supported it, offsetting opposition from both the far-right National Rally and the left-wing France Unbowed. Financial markets had closely watched the vote because the bill is presented by the government as part of efforts to contain France’s public deficit, which officials expect to stand at around 5.4% of GDP this year.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/J2b5_byyIE7IiTx_N8hACZJ0AVKGwEoipVmqWReI3W2DCfDnGs5vm-GWVFT79z-ncW8K0Qrx1FzABMlpAcP4TgL_xPycP-bNuqqIIUO8jyfALg_-OlEMAADSoDOVWwhLaxtkImoJv25-5qYvJr5jGVF8qXoaTmoEzRFSTxV0KTwi7ok7sQ' alt='Lawmakers display the result of the 2026 social security financing vote at the French National Assembly in Paris on December 9, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Prime minister’s stakes: Lecornu, who has been prime minister for about three months and even briefly resigned during a previous political crisis, needed the vote to demonstrate he can govern with only a minority and avoid resorting again to constitutional shortcuts to pass a core part of his budget program.</li><li>Party dynamics: While Macron’s Renaissance bloc voted as one, the center-right Les Républicains split between backing and abstaining, and lawmakers aligned with former prime minister Édouard Philippe largely withheld support after he argued the bill did not sufficiently reduce the deficit.</li><li>Opposition blocs: Deputies from Marine Le Pen’s National Rally on the far right and Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s France Unbowed on the far left rejected the bill, criticizing both its spending priorities and its approach to social protection.</li><li>Pension element: The text provides for suspending implementation of a contested pension change, which had aimed to raise the retirement age for certain categories, signaling the government’s willingness to adjust reforms that sparked strong public resistance.</li><li>Next legislative steps: After this first reading in the National Assembly, the social security financing bill returns to the Senate, where amendments are likely, before a final version is sent back to the lower house for ultimate adoption under France’s bicameral procedure.</li></ul><blockquote>Making compromises is not a slogan, it means moving forward for the common good - Sébastien Lecornu</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>French government: Prime Minister Lecornu welcomed the result as proof that different political groups can assume &quot;responsibility&quot; by backing a compromise text intended to stabilize France’s social accounts and reassure partners about its willingness to manage public debt.
