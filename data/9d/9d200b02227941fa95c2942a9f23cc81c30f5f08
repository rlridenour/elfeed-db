<p>Jacob Parry, reporting last week for Politico:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We have spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made
dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users
have asked for,” said Apple spokesperson Emma Wilson. “Despite
countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal
posts every step of the way.”</p>

<p>These public comments echo concerns the company raised directly
with the Commission.</p>

<p>According to correspondence seen by Politico, Apple offered last
summer <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=szrqxadx">to drop its rules</a> on how app developers can
communicate with users, but was told by the Commission to hold
off, pending feedback from developers.</p>

<p>By late September and following a round of consultations with
Apple critics like Spotify, Match Group and Epic Games, executives
at the U.S.-based firm began worrying that a lack of feedback from
the Commission meant it was teeing up a potential fine and
noncompliance decision.</p>

<p>In an October 2024 letter sent to senior officials in DG Connect
and DG Competition, and seen by Politico, an Apple executive
complained that the Commission’s case teams had “made clear” that
then-Commissioner Margrethe Vestager intended to issue a decision
with a “potentially significant fine.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, it sounds like the European Commission worked backwards to fining Apple last year in a similar way to how Apple <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/gonzales_rogers_apple_app_store_ruling">worked backwards to arrive at a 27 percent</a> commission on web transactions initiated in apps from the App Store.</p>
