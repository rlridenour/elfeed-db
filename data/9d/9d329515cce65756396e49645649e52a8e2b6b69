<p>I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> for just a few things, particular when
connecting to a remote system. But otherwise, I don’t use it for local
terminals, as I can just open up another terminal in Wayland.</p>

<p>I have a Kensington trackball with a big scroll wheel. I’ve gotten
very used to using that scroll wheel for scrolling in terminals,
Emacs, my web browser, etc. But one place it didn’t work was in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmux</code>.</p>

<p>But today I finally went searching around for how to turn on mouse
support. Something I read prompted me to think “Oh yeah, how do I do
that?” It turns out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmux</code> does support the mouse, but not by
default. So you have to enable the support in your tmux configuration
file. I added</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini"><span class="err">set</span> <span class="err">-g</span> <span class="err">mouse</span> <span class="err">on</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>to $HOME/.config/tmux/tmux.conf, restarted tmux, and boom, I have
mouse wheel scrolling like most other applications I use.</p>
