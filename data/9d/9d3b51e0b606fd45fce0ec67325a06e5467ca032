<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said the United States, Israel and European leaders exploited Iran’s economic problems and helped fuel recent nationwide protests, accusing them of trying to “tear the nation apart”. He specifically referenced President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and European leaders in remarks aired on Iranian state television. The protests began in late December amid soaring inflation and rising living costs, and reports say they eased after a harsh crackdown that included mass arrests, killings and a near-total internet shutdown. International scrutiny has intensified: Politico reports the U.N. Human Rights Council held an emergency session, while the EU designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization and signaled additional sanctions could follow.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/vvP2QWH_4HyHfadX3VgDsHLGbnDcyRNrGydVgkL4J05RQMZ8V2ug4T7ShsCdy6kJRhNlY4NTZNQj5BCNU-S-d7-jpHtN1m3JGJZqNzLH8FGRapmwHkl7TlSSGn8Py5YhKzOGMp-yUQZuYLdR501dDNfUyRjiHdyPpIVJRgf_QPeUzECvAvY' alt='People gather during protests in Iran amid an economic crisis, as reported by multiple outlets.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Casualty figures: A U.S.-based rights group, HRANA, said the crackdown killed at least 6,563 people, including 6,170 protesters and 214 security forces.</li><li>UN scrutiny: The U.N.
