<p>President Trump told reporters he would be &quot;ok&quot; ordering strikes inside Mexico to stop drug trafficking and said he would be &quot;proud&quot; to do so, framing narcotics flows as a deadly threat to Americans during remarks in the Oval Office on Monday. He linked the stance to broader pressure on narcotics networks across the region and said he supports tougher action in Colombia as well. Trump declined to clearly say whether such strikes would require Mexico’s permission, and the White House also said it has been speaking with Mexican authorities about options after recent maritime incidents.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/3WSkC0qzmPxzmWHKUR7C0s7gzD9WDLq3e_h0HWuNKgHk6ryp9IMY25_ka-Mr-LSAnWTRbJyKpiZ3i83tyyy2XEXefGMz49KdwDkAMtIk06dwvEcM8YperMTViBzLTEJJe9neqKrhxzviuLcD1op9l0geYgk4_v4u_CIuzBCKeGejw6qiiB10HtMjrJr40suk5uXa9UmVQVgzGCxRJBaqSsI9N9v0pkk29xsLyKI' alt='Donald Trump speaking at the White House on Monday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Mexico response: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly rejected any foreign military presence and said US military action inside Mexico without consent will not happen</li><li>Sanctions and tariffs: The US has already used non-military tools this year, imposing sweeping sanctions on Mexican-linked individuals and entities and a 25% tariff on Mexican imports, part of a broader pressure campaign</li><li>Regional scope: Trump explicitly framed tougher measures as applying beyond Mexico, saying he backs escalated efforts against cartels in Colombia as part of a wider regional approach</li><li>Operational claims: The president asserted US authorities &quot;know every route&quot; and &quot;the addresses of every drug lord,&quot; signaling confidence in available intelligence should tougher operations proceed</li></ul><blockquote>Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs?
