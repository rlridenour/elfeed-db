<p><a href="https://www.openculture.com/2018/11/inca-used-intricately-knotted-cords-called-khipu-write-histories-keep-records.html"><em>Khipus,</em></a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;portable information archives created by the Inca, may stir up memories of 1970s macrame with their long strands of intricately knotted, earth-toned fibers, but their function more closely resembled that of a densely plotted computerized spreadsheet.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;Cecilia Pardo-Grau, lead curator of the British Museum’s current exhibition<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/peru-journey-time">Peru: a journey in time</a></em>&nbsp;explains in the above Curators Corner episode,&nbsp;<em>khipus</em> were used to keep track of everything from inventories and censuses to historical narratives, using a system&nbsp;that assigned meaning to the type and position of knot, spaces between knots, cord length, fiber color, etc.</p>

<p>Much of the information preserved within&nbsp;<em>khipus</em>&nbsp;has yet to be deciphered by modern scholars, though the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/khipulab/open-khipu-repository#:~:text=The%20Open%20Khipu%20Repository,as%20museums%20around%20the%20world.">Open&nbsp;<em>Khipu&nbsp;</em>Repository</a> — computational anthropologist&nbsp;Jon Clindaniel’s open-source database — makes it possible to compare the patterns of hundreds of&nbsp;<em>khipus</em>&nbsp;residing in museum and university collections.</p>
<p>Even in the Incan Empire, few were equipped to make sense of a&nbsp;<em>khipu</em>. This task fell to&nbsp;<em>quipucamayocs,</em> highborn administrative officials trained since childhood in the creation and interpretation of these organic spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Fleet messengers known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.saexpeditions.com/blog/post/how-inca-chaskis-covered-1250-miles-in-a-week"><em>chaskis</em></a>&nbsp;transported&nbsp;<em>khipu</em>s on foot between administrative centers, creating an information superhighway that predates the Internet by some five centuries.&nbsp;<em>Khipus</em>’ sturdy organic cotton or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/camelid">native camelid</a>&nbsp;fibers were well suited to withstanding both the rigors of time and the road.</p>
<p>A 500-year-old composite&nbsp;<em>khipu</em> that found its way to the British Museum organics conservator Nicole Rode prior to the exhibition was intact, but severely tangled, with a brittleness that betrayed its age. Below, she describes falling under the <em>khipu’s</em>&nbsp;spell, during the painstaking process of restoring it to a condition whereby researchers could attempt to glean some of its secrets.</p>
