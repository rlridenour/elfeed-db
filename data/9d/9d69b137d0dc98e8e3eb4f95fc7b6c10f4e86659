<p>Egypt officially opened the $1 billion Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) near the Giza pyramids on Saturday, ending a two‑decade construction project and putting thousands of artifacts on public display, including the full Tutankhamun collection for the first time . The inauguration blended spectacle and state pageantry — with music, fireworks and a pharaonic-themed ceremony — and was attended by foreign presidents and prime ministers, highlighting the site&#x27;s diplomatic as well as cultural importance . Egypt’s leaders and museum officials framed the GEM as a national milestone intended to boost tourism and house long‑held antiquities, while the opening also renewed international debate about objects still held in overseas museums .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/4lVp0Fg8JKVXKjbtx5kpOEJTLQwSqxaixBUAjrrZoNaUUEeDQRmaYZKYVHRQwwApXfvb23Wt5_32_gyYGeVmqWQyZhq4o1ViuKPruQ2m' alt='People walk in the grounds of the Grand Egyptian Museum prior to its opening in Giza' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ceremonial spectacle: Dozens of performers in pharaonic costumes, lasers, an international orchestra and fireworks accompanied the launch, creating a large public spectacle outside the museum .</li><li>Missing highlights: Several high-profile objects are absent from GEM’s collection — the Rosetta Stone, the Dendera Zodiac and the bust of Nefertiti remain in foreign institutions, a point raised by culture commentators .</li><li>Everyday life displays: The museum will display tomb paintings that depict ordinary ancient Egyptians at work — fishing, fowling and cooking — offering social context beyond royal treasures .</li><li>Architectural features: A colossal statue of Ramses II, previously sited in downtown Cairo, now greets visitors in the museum&#x27;s grand entry hall as a centrepiece of the new galleries .</li></ul><blockquote>They’re fishing, they’re fowling, they’re cooking, - Salima Ikram</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Egyptian presidency: President Abdel Fattah al‑Sisi described the museum as a new chapter for Egypt, presenting it as a gift from Egypt to the world and a symbol of national pride .
