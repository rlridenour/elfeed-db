<blockquote>
  <p>President Donald Trump on Friday extended a deadline requiring China-based ByteDance to sell the U.S. operations of TikTok or face an effective ban in the country, marking the second time he has taken such action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump, on Truth Social, which is by far the most popular social network in the world:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE
TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires
more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is
why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running
for an additional 75 days. We hope to continue working in Good
Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our
Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between
China and the U.S.A.!). This proves that Tariffs are the most
powerful Economic tool, and very important to our National
Security! We do not want TikTok to “go dark.” We look forward to
working with TikTok and China to close the Deal. Thank you for
your attention to this matter!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are the remarks of the most powerful man in the world.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that there is no mechanism in the law for the president to issue any such extension. What he’s saying is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok">what he said the last time</a>: he’s instructing Attorney General Pam Bondi not to enforce the law, and pinky-swearing that U.S. companies that are breaking the law to keep TikTok available (Akamai, Oracle, Google, Apple) <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/my_spitball_theory_on_tiktoks_current_semi-reprieve_in_the_us">won’t be held responsible for it</a>. It’s just a complete abdication of the rule of law.</p>

<p>Not a peep from Republican Tom Cotton, who, on the cusp of Trump taking office again, <a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-ricketts-statement-on-tiktok-being-removed-from-app-stores">was crowing about the PAFACA Act coming into effect to shut TikTok down in the US</a>.</p>
