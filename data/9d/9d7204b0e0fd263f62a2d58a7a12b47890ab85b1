  <p>Today, we’re introducing the next generation of Claude models:
Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, setting new standards for
coding, advanced reasoning, and AI agents.</p>

<p>Claude Opus 4 is the world’s best coding model, with sustained
performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows.
Claude Sonnet 4 is a significant upgrade to Claude Sonnet 3.7,
delivering superior coding and reasoning while responding more
precisely to your instructions.</p>

<p>It’s almost as though this is a fast-moving field.</p>

<p>There’s a recent rumor — <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/02/apple-taps-anthropics-claude-for-ai-assisted-coding-internally-as-developers-await-swift-assist/">from Mark Gurman, natch</a> — that Apple is partnering with Anthropic to integrate Claude with Xcode. So Apple doesn’t have to do everything themselves. Developers, in particular, love <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/22/google-translate-default-ios-18">modularity</a> and choices. But whatever they do, once-a-year updates to “Apple Intelligence” aren’t going to cut it. Since last WWDC there have been dozens of AI code generation advances across the industry. Just last week <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/16/openai-codex/#atom-everything">OpenAI announced Codex</a>, their “cloud-based software engineering agent”. Meanwhile, <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/03/12/whither-swift-assist/">Apple’s Swift Assist still hasn’t shipped</a>.</p>
