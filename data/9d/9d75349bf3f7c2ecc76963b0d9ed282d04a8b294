This year's upcoming Apple Watch Ultra 3 will feature satellite connectivity and a new 5G cellular modem, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-23/apple-aapl-explores-turning-watches-into-wearable-ai-devices-with-cameras-m8ll6mvy"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

Apple first introduced satellite connectivity for off-grid texting with the iPhone 14, and the feature has been included in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16, but no Apple Watch models so far.<br/>
<br/>
Support for satellite messaging on the Apple Watch Ultra would allow users to send texts when out of range of cellular and Wi-Fi networks, similar to how it works on iPhone. Initially limited to emergency use, satellite texting expanded in iOS 18 to support messages to any contact.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says Apple aims to make this feature a key selling point for the third-generation Ultra, expected in September 2025. It also positions the device to better compete with brands like Garmin, which offer satellite-equipped gear for remote and rugged environments. Gurman first reported on the upcoming features <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-10/apple-plans-apple-watch-ultra-3-next-year-with-satellite-texting-and-5g">last December</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Designed for adventurers, divers, and hikers, the Ultra will gain a new safety edge with off-grid communication capabilities. Satellite access remains free for now on supporting iPhones, which include two years of coverage. Apple is expected to offer the same for the Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman also reports that Apple plans to move away from Intel cellular modems in future Watch models, shifting to MediaTek. MediaTek's chip supports 5G RedCap – a low-power, mid-speed version of 5G tailored for wearables. Current Apple Watch models still use 4G LTE, despite iPhones having adopted 5G years ago.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/2025-apple-watch-ultra-5g-satellite-texting/">2025 Apple Watch Ultra to Support 5G and Satellite Texting</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2025-apple-watch-ultra-to-support-5g-and-satellite-texting.2453947/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
