Spotify appears to be gearing up to launch its long-awaited lossless music tier.<br/>

<a href="https://www.threads.com/@chris/post/DLDaG4XBhdJ">Chris Messina</a> (via <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/new-code-in-spotifys-app-references-the-long-awaited-lossless-tier/">TechCrunch</a></em>) and <a href="https://twitter.com/spicetifyapp/status/1935739343244562489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1935739343244562489%7Ctwgr%5E5b2c9167f87386461963f747b2a691661f639876%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fnews%2F690107%2Fspotify-lossless-streaming-hifi-music-pro-spicetify">Spicetify</a> (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690107/spotify-lossless-streaming-hifi-music-pro-spicetify"><em>The Verge</em></a>) spotted new lossless references within the code for Spotify's desktop app and web player.<br/>
<br/>
With assistance from <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>, <em>MacRumors</em> has confirmed that the latest beta of the Spotify app for the iPhone also contains new lossless-related code.<br/>
<br/>
Lossless songs retain all of the audio data from the original recording.<br/>
<br/>
One line of code says Spotify's lossless audio will be 24-bit at 44.1 kHz.<br/>
<br/>
"Introducing the best sound quality on Spotify: for music in up to 24-bit/44.1 kHz."<br/>
<br/>
Lossless audio will be available to stream or download in the Spotify app on the iPhone, reads another line of code for the beta app.<br/>
<br/>
In February, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Lucas Shaw reported that Spotify was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/17/spotify-hi-fi-premium-tier-coming-this-year/">planning to launch a Music Pro subscription tier</a> that offers higher-quality audio, remixing tools, and access to concert tickets. The report said Spotify was considering charging as much as &#36;5.99 per month for this perk, on top of the standard price of Spotify Premium.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear when Spotify will finally roll out lossless audio, but the report said that it aimed to make Music Pro available later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify first announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/spotify-hifi-lossless-streaming-option/">plans for a "Hi-Fi" tier</a> with lossless audio in 2021.<br/>
<br/>
2021 is the same year that most songs in the Apple Music catalog <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-music-spatial-audio-lossless-available/">became available in lossless audio</a>, at up to 24-bit/192 kHz. This perk is offered to Apple Music subscribers at no additional cost, so Spotify's offering is both late and will seemingly cost extra.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/19/spotify-preparing-lossless-tier-on-ios/">Spotify Preparing to Launch Long-Awaited Lossless Audio Tier on iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-preparing-to-launch-long-awaited-lossless-audio-tier-on-iphone.2459333/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
