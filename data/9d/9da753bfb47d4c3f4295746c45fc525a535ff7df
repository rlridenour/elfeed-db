Nils Holm.  <i>Lisp from Nothing</i>. Lulu Press. 2025.
</p>

<p>
This is a fascinating book that's very old-school – and I mean
that in the best possible way. It does exactly what it says:
develops a Lisp interpreter (and then a compiler) from first
principles, bootstrapped on top of an existing Lisp or Scheme
against a runtime written in C, with all code provided.
</p>

<p>
It's more than this, though. There's a thorough discussion of the
differences between dynamic and lexical variable scope (and the
implications for both programming and implementation). There's a
digression into pure lambda calculus and the complexities that <i>it</i>
introduces. There's a basic mark/sweep garbage collector. There's
a brief history of Lisp and Lisp machines. And there's a
performance evaluation that digs into where the costs lie within
the system.
</p>

<p>
Overall this is a book that every implementor should read, if only
to see some other parts of the possible design space for Lisp
tooling. Many applications will want to occupy a different point
in that space, for example providing a richer compiler, or a
richer runtime. But there's a lot to learn from the simplicity of
the choices made here.
