Both of the stores will be permanently closing tomorrow, for landlord-related reasons. Apple Bristol is closing due to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/21/apple-store-bristol-closing-next-month/">landlord's redevelopment plans</a> at the Cabot Circus Shopping Centre, and the adjacent Bristol Shopping Quarter, while Apple Parkland is closing because the mall faced financial struggles and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/apple-stores-opening-or-closing-list/">lost many major retailers</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Bristol and Apple Parkland will both open at 10 a.m. local time tomorrow. In Bristol, the doors will close for good at 5 p.m. local time, while customers in Dalian will have until 8 p.m. local time to visit one final time.<br/>
<br/>
While it is a shame that Apple is leaving central Bristol, customers with a means of transportation can still visit <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/retail/cribbscauseway/">Apple Cribbs Causeway</a> on the outskirts of the city. Likewise, Apple will continue to operate its <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/retail/olympia66dalian/">Olympia 66 store</a> in Dalian.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, Apple will be temporarily closing its <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/theforumshops/">store at The Forum Shops</a> in Caesars Palace following business hours this Saturday, for behind-the-scenes renovations. Apple says the store will re-open on August 31. During the closure, customers can visit Apple's nearby <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/fashionshow/">Fashion Show store</a>, which is also on the Las Vegas Strip.<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, customers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania are getting an all-new <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/shadyside/">Apple Shadyside</a> on Walnut Street tomorrow, with the new location set to hold its grand opening at 10 a.m. local time. The new store is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/apple-store-in-pittsburgh-moving/">located at 5436 Walnut Street</a>, just west of Bellefonte Street, in a two-floor unit that was previously occupied by clothing brand Gap. The new store is much larger than the original, and it has a modern design.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/08/two-apple-stores-permanently-closing-tomorrow/">Two Apple Stores Permanently Closing Tomorrow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/two-apple-stores-permanently-closing-tomorrow.2463003/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
