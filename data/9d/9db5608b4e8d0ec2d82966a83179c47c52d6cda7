New data published by <a href="https://www.sellcell.com/blog/one-in-five-iphone-users-still-havent-upgraded-to-ios-26/">SellCell</a> provides a look at how users have responded to the push to update to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. The findings are based on a January 2026 survey of 2,000 U.S.-based adult <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users and focus on adoption status, update behavior, and perceived risks associated with installing &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
78% of SellCell's respondents say they have updated their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, while 22% report that they are still running an earlier version of iOS. There have been other reports of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/ios-26-shows-unusually-slow-adoption/">low adoption</a> for &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, so 78% would be unusually high and may indicate a disproportionate number of tech enthusiasts among respondents. Realistically, the actual number likely lies somewhere in between at around 50%, as <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/ios-version-market-share/mobile-tablet/worldwide/#weekly-202604-202604-bar">StatCounter</a> shows. SellCell stresses that the data reflects self-reported behavior rather than device-verified installation rates. <br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, the survey highlights key reasons as to why some users have still not upgraded. 24.2% of respondents said they were concerned that &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; could negatively affect battery life, while 23.8% worried about overall performance. 17.5% of respondents said they disliked the design changes debuted with Liquid Glass, or found it harder to read, while an additional 8.6% said they were frustrated that new visual elements could not be fully turned off. 15% of respondents said they worried it would be difficult or impossible to revert to an earlier version of iOS once &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; was installed, while 11.4% cited reports of bugs or features breaking as a reason for hesitation. <br/>
<br/>
SellCell's data also suggests that adoption does not necessarily reflect confidence. When asked about their general response to iOS update prompts, only 38.8% of respondents said they typically update immediately when prompted. The remaining 61.2% reported some form of delay or deferral, including waiting to see whether other users report problems, assuming updates occur automatically, dismissing reminders, or postponing updates for weeks or months. A smaller share said they only update once an app stops working on their current version of iOS.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the survey found that hesitation around &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is widespread even among users who have already installed the update. Across the full sample of 2,000 respondents, 72% selected at least one concern that made them hesitant about upgrading, while only 28% said that nothing they had seen put them off installing &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. It is also notable that, of the 443 respondents who said they were still on an older version, 28% said they were unaware that &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; was available, 23.7% said they assumed updates would install automatically, and 23.3% said they simply had not gotten around to updating. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sellcell/">SellCell</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/27/ios-26-adoption-hits-50-percent/">iOS 26 Adoption Hits 50%, But Some Users Are Still Reluctant to Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-adoption-hits-50-but-some-users-are-still-reluctant-to-update.2476726/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
