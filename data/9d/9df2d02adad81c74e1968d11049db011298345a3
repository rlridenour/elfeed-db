<p id="p2">While the highlights of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-introduces-airpods-pro-3/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s AirPods Pro 3 reveal</a> seemed to be the addition of heart rate sensors, increased battery life, and improved Active Noise Cancellation, Dallas Taylor on YouTube went a bit deeper on the actual listening experience.</p>
<p id="p3">Taylor is a sound designer and the host of the excellent <a href="https://www.20k.org" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twenty Thousand Hertz</a> podcast. (I can highly recommend <a href="https://www.20k.org/episodes/the-sound-of-apple" rel="noopener noreferrer">this episode</a> about the famous sounds of Apple and <a href="https://www.20k.org/episodes/itsnottvitshbo" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a> about the iconic sound of HBO.) He also runs a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dallastaylor.mp3" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a> and was invited to Apple Park yesterday to try out the new AirPods Pro for himself.</p>
<p id="p4">He came away very impressed with the improved ANC, but what stood out to me was the significant upgrade in sound quality he mentioned, especially the bass. You can watch Taylor give his thoughts below, but it&rsquo;s interesting to hear about a notable improvement in what people use AirPods for the most: listening to music.</p>
