Instagram today announced the launch of Blend, a new feature that's designed to allow users to connect to their friends in new ways over DMs. Blend is essentially a shared feed of Reels that combines recommendations that users and their friends might like.<br/>

To start a Blend with a friend or a group of friends, users can go to a DM and then tap on the Blend icon. From there, everyone in the DM group is able to participate.<br/>
<br/>
The Blend will include Reels that users in the group are interested in, based on what they've browsed individually and what's been shared in the DM thread. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIjbqOGqjse/">Instagram chief Adam Mosseri</a> said that it's a way for users to share their interests with their friends, and to start new conversations.<br/>
<br/>
Blend feeds will refresh with new content each day as a way to keep participants coming back to the conversation. Every chat can have a unique Blend with different participants.<br/>
<br/>
Instagram has been testing Blend with a small group of Instagram users since March, but it is now rolling out more widely.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/instagram-blend-shared-reels/">Instagram Announces &#039;Blend&#039; Shared Reel Feeds</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-announces-blend-shared-reel-feeds.2455553/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
