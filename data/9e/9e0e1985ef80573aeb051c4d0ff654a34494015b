<p>The Indiana state legislature has passed a budget bill that will have the effect of closing programs at several public universities in the state, including some philosophy programs, unless the universities request permission to continue them and those requests are granted by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education.</p>

Reportedly, this is unrelated to the state budget cuts.</p></div>
<p>The budget bill sets as a requirement for a program&#8217;s continuation a minimum average number of graduates (calculated over the past three years): 10 students for associate degree programs, 15 students for BA programs, 7 students for MA programs, and 3 students for PhD programs.</p>
<p>Apparently over 400 programs fail to meet these requirements, according to a <a href="https://www.in.gov/che/files/Info-Item-Voluntary-Early-Actions-and-Future-Commitments-Before-HEA1001-2025-Implementation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list</a> created from information provided by the universities.</p>
<p>The philosophy programs affected include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the bachelor&#8217;s and master&#8217;s programs at <a href="https://indianapolis.iu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana University Indianapolis</a></li>
<li>the bachelor&#8217;s program at <a href="https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ball State University</a></li>
<li>the bachelor&#8217;s program at <a href="https://www.pnw.edu/history-philosophy-politics-economics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purdue University Northwest</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not know whether any of the universities have requested exemptions for these programs, or, if they have, what their prospects for success are. Those with further information are welcome to share it in the comments or <a href="mailto:dailynouseditor@gmail.com">email me</a>.</p>
