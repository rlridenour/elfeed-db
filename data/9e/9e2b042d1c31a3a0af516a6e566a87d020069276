&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; users in South Korea and Japan have reported seeing F1: The Movie available in the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; store, but it does not appear to be available through the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ streaming service as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
In South Korea and Japan, it is already Friday, August 22, so it is possible that it won't be available in the U.S. until midnight Eastern time.<br/>
<br/>
F1: The Movie launched in theaters <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/27/f1-the-movie-now-playing-in-theaters/">on June 27</a>, and it had a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/f1-surpasses-500-million/">highly successful box office run</a>. The film earned more than &#36;500 million globally, making it Apple's highest-grossing theatrical release to date. Apple did a second theatrical run in August.<br/>
<br/>
Ahead of when F1 launched in theaters, there was a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/18/f1-movie-ticket-discounts/">relentless advertising campaign</a> from Apple and other companies featured in the film. Apple ran ads on YouTube, sent Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Brad Pitt to Apple Fifth Avenue, put a guide in the Maps app for well-known F1 racetracks, and even put ads for the movie <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/24/apple-wallet-notification-f1-movie-ad/">in the built-in Wallet app</a> and the Sports app, frustrating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users.<br/>
<br/>
It is not yet clear when F1: The Movie will be available for &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ subscribers.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/21/f1-movie-rolling-out-apple-tv-app/">F1: The Movie Rolling Out for Purchase From Apple TV App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/f1-the-movie-rolling-out-for-purchase-from-apple-tv-app.2463779/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
