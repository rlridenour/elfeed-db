<p>The US National Transportation Safety Board released its final report on Wednesday concluding that OceanGate’s Titan submersible imploded in 2023 because of faulty engineering [scmp.com#1][dw.com#1][bbc.com#1][straitstimes.com#1]. Investigators said OceanGate’s engineering process was inadequate, producing a carbon‑fibre pressure hull with multiple anomalies that failed to meet strength and durability requirements, and that the company did not adequately test the craft to understand its true limits [dawn.com#1][dw.com#1]. They also found OceanGate misinterpreted real‑time hull monitoring data and was unaware Titan had been damaged on a previous dive, when it should have been removed from service [dawn.com#1]. The report further noted the operator lacked a clear grasp of the vehicle’s limits and did not follow established emergency protocols [firstpost.com#1]. All five aboard died during the descent to the Titanic wreck in the North Atlantic, and a US Coast Guard probe in August called the incident a &quot;preventable tragedy&quot; while outlining numerous issues with the company’s conduct and design [scmp.com#1][dawn.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/jYadybjj4URWXTfBXJUq2tJ6MMl9Mkd2-kkzOyQhf_vqIxsWuXtmE3lOOFSlw4RjSrCsXtkycFPucALXKbhPUVBQj84lE4PtiCzrv904e6cT' alt='The Titan submersible, operated by OceanGate Expeditions, during a dive to explore the Titanic wreck.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Dive timeline: Communications with the Titan were lost about 1 hour and 45 minutes into its June 18, 2023 descent [dawn.com#1].</li><li>Prior damage: NTSB said flawed analysis of real‑time monitoring left OceanGate unaware Titan had been damaged on a previous dive and should have been pulled from service [dawn.com#1].</li><li>Operations halted: OceanGate stopped all operations shortly after the disaster, according to reporting cited in the NTSB coverage [dawn.com#1].</li><li>Victims identified: Those who died were OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, Hamish Harding, Paul‑Henri Nargeolet, Shahzada Dawood, and his son Suleman [dawn.com#1][bbc.com#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US National Transportation Safety Board: Concluded the implosion resulted from faulty engineering, inadequate testing, and misinterpreted monitoring data.
