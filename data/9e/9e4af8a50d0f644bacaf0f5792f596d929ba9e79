<p>The Louvre Museum in Paris has confirmed that a water leak in late November damaged several hundred items in the library of its Egyptian antiquities department, including rare books and documents used by researchers and curators. Museum officials said the leak came from an ageing water pipe above the department’s library and offices, and that the problem had been known for years, with repairs not scheduled until September 2026. According to deputy administrator Francis Steinbock, up to about 400 documents were affected, but no ancient artworks or museum objects on display were harmed, and staff quickly moved volumes and protected the area once the leak was discovered. The incident, which follows a recent jewel theft at the museum, has renewed public scrutiny of the Louvre’s infrastructure, security, and funding for basic maintenance at the world’s most visited museum.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ArM4HpTVdUJIKn3uqnEwVzoFJm7N0Nz9-Aqb0TZqK21bH0sVG1bTGB-3FCTsttUxwyPDMKeyPXl80dfVkydkvngMeSOlLnelecgXXWUpmNkL_A9RWYsWgWenSM5JBGDSBSmrZAikhLDKfGJXBT9xXaXxty7A_YVo0IrjZYrnVVO36TK_wY8xfXfdoj9cz5PkX91a-2gmlGYH9IJZjJDgjYPG' alt='A corridor at the Louvre near the Egyptian antiquities area, where a leaking pipe damaged hundreds of rare books in the department’s library.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Damaged material: Reports describe the affected items as historically important Egyptology books and archival works stored in the Egyptian department’s specialist library rather than sculptures, mummies, or other gallery objects.</li><li>Staff response: Employees and conservators reportedly intervened quickly to relocate volumes, dry pages, and limit mold risk once water was noticed in the room, helping to contain the scope of the damage.</li><li>Longstanding warnings: A French art-history website said the department had repeatedly requested funding to fix deteriorating pipes and protect the library collection but did not obtain the necessary budget before the leak occurred.</li><li>Security context: The leak comes only weeks after a brazen theft of jewels from another part of the Louvre, an episode that had already raised questions about the museum’s security systems and upkeep.</li><li>Planned renovation: The Louvre’s administration has cited an upcoming renovation program, with pipe repairs scheduled for 2026, as part of broader efforts to modernize the building’s infrastructure after this and other recent incidents.</li></ul><blockquote>No works of art were affected by the leak - Francis Steinbock</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Louvre Museum administration: The museum’s deputy administrator emphasized that the leak affected documents in the Egyptian department’s library but spared artworks, and pointed to a scheduled 2026 renovation of the plumbing as part of the response to ageing infrastructure.
