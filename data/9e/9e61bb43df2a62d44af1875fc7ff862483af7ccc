<p>I just learned that globbing in fish is WAY more powerful than I realized, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>instead of <code>find . -name '*.md'</code> I can just do <code>ls **.md</code></li>
<li>instead of <code>find . -type d -name ‘*blah*’</code>, I can just <code>ls -d **blah*/</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>apparently you can do this in zsh or bash (with <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/bash-extended-globbing">bash&rsquo;s extended globbing</a>) too, though it might be <code>**/*.md</code> instead of <code>**.md</code></li>
<li>as usual globs don&rsquo;t include dotfiles so it&rsquo;s not exactly the same as running <code>find</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Learned this from <a href="https://adamspiers.org/computing/shells/">this page from 2004 on shells</a> which mentioned offhand that
&ldquo;under zsh, [globbing] is so powerful, it almost makes find redundant.&rdquo;</p>
