<p>French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed that his government will unveil a new voluntary national military service this week, aimed at strengthening France’s armed forces in response to what he calls a long-term security threat from Russia. He stressed that the scheme will be optional, compensated and carried out in France, explicitly ruling out any plan to send young French participants to fight in Ukraine. The announcement comes after France’s army chief, Gen. Fabien Mandon, triggered public uproar by telling a gathering of mayors that French society must be prepared to &quot;accept losing our children&quot; in the event of a major conflict, remarks that sparked fears of an impending draft. Macron, while insisting Europe &quot;must not be weak&quot; in the face of Russian aggression, presented the new service as a way to bolster national resilience and defence readiness without mandatory conscription.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lPUSqY800bRM8CAmc3A75nde-MDExaKXwtQt0Bw1sopCS4am9XlbKHJepIDVld7jMD8wYRQHdlFHtNDw5R0ts2gKL7gkRWQ8QY5oTsX2rMXZsr8Gx5xUdBZAeRJDz0ub5r_3dbDOJKICjJDuzVzk7PTGxE9d6qZFzeNFep4T0SsJ17U51DfbhCqQXXFZbBcNknri2zIRJMdM6g' alt='France’s army chief Gen.
