<p>The Wall Street Journal yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paramount launched a $77.9 billion hostile takeover offer for
Warner Bros. Discovery Monday, taking its case for acquiring the
storied entertainment company directly to shareholders just days
after Warner agreed to a deal with Netflix.</p>

<p>Paramount, run by David Ellison, is arguing that its all-cash
$30-a-share offer for all of Warner, owner of networks such as
CNN, TBS and HGTV as well as the HBO Max streaming service, is
a better deal for shareholders and more likely to pass
regulatory muster.</p>

<p>“We’re really here to finish what we started,” Ellison said on
CNBC Monday morning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “more likely to pass regulatory muster” bit is a euphemism for the Ellisons (David, and the real player here, his $250+-billion-dollar-net-worth father Larry) being on the inside of the Trump administration oligarchy. It’s so transparent that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner is part of the hostile bid, along with sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar.</p>

<p>That said, while the Executive Branch is influential in such regulatory approvals, it’s <em>not</em> completely under their control. The U.S. court system, while under duress from this administration, remains independent, and <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/jack-smith-2674262772/">with admittedly notable exceptions</a>, remains largely on the up-and-up.</p>

<p>And CNN’s Brian Stelter reports that <a href="https://x.com/brianstelter/status/1998112063902691718">Netflix was prepared for this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Today’s move was entirely expected,” Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos
said on stage at a UBS conference just now, waving off Paramount’s
hostile play for WBD. “We have a deal done, and we are incredibly
happy with the deal... We’re super confident we’re going to get it
across.”</p>
