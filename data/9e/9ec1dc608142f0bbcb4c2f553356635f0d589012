<p>Giovanni Colantonio at Digital Trends reports that <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/">Apple has scooped up the game studio behind Apple Arcade’s Sneaky Sasquatch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We love Sneaky Sasquatch and are excited that the 2-person RAC7 team has joined Apple to continue their work on it with us,” an Apple spokesperson tells Digital Trends. “We will continue to deliver a great experience for Apple Arcade players with hundreds of games from many of the best game developers in the world.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Several interesting things here. First of all, RAC7 being a two-person shop indicates that this isn’t really a huge acquisition—certainly not on the level of buying a triple-A game studio. As Colantonio says, this seems more like a one-off than part of a revamped strategy for Apple and gaming.<sup id="fnref-35135-applegaming"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-35135-applegaming" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Sneaky Sasquatch is one of the more popular Apple Arcade games, and dates back to 2019, when the service launched. The game isn’t available on competing platforms, which means that this could be a strategic move to keep it—and subsequent titles from the developer—exclusive. But I also can’t help but feel that if Apple really wanted to make Arcade a success, it would have been taking moves like this years ago when it first announced the service. In 2025, it feels like too little, too late.</p>
