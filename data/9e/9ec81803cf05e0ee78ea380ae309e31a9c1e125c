<p>The peculiar circumstances of life aboard the International Space Station both advanced and retarded astronaut Scott Kelly&#8217;s age relative to that of his identical twin brother Mark, who remained on the ground.</p>
<p>Radiation, weightlessness, and changes in diet shortened Scott&#8217;s telomeres more quickly than his brother&#8217;s, effectively causing him to age more quickly.</p>
