Chinese smartphone maker Vivo has taken some inspiration from Apple's Liquid Glass design language for its latest operating system update, OriginOS 6. Unveiled this week, OriginOS 6 has the same rounded buttons and translucent glass look as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>.<br/>

In a demo video, a Vivo smartphone features an interface that could be easily mistaken for &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. There's a Liquid Glass clock, Control Center, squircle icons, glass-like rounded buttons, translucent app folders and dock, translucent notifications, and even wallpapers that shift with a 2D to 3D effect like Apple's Spatial Scenes.<br/>
<br/>
There is no mistaking the Liquid Glass design influence even though Vivo references water when describing the operating system. "With OriginOS 6, every swipe, scroll, and tap flows like never before. No lags. No stutters. Just effortless motion built for the way you move," reads <a href="https://x.com/Vivo_India/status/1974017799384129580">some of the marketing material</a> for the update.<br/>
