<p>During lunch one day at Los Alamos, Richard Feynman told his colleagues, &#8220;I can work out in sixty seconds the answer to any problem that anybody can state in ten seconds, to 10 percent!&#8221;</p>
<p>He had completed several challenges when mathematician Paul Olum walked past.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8216;Hey, Paul!&#8217; they call out. &#8216;Feynman&#8217;s terrific! We give him a problem that can be stated in ten seconds, and in a minute he gets the answer to 10 percent. Why don&#8217;t you give him one?&#8217;</p>
<p>Without hardly stopping, he says, &#8216;The tangent of 10 to the 100th.&#8217;
</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I was sunk: <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/253910/the-integral-that-stumped-feynman/388972#388972">you have to divide by pi to 100 decimal places!</a> It was hopeless. &#8230; <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2025/03/25/late-progress/">He was a very smart fellow</a>.&#8221;</p>
