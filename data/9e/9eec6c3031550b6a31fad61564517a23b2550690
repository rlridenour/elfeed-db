<p>Clipboard managers aren’t usually exciting. Most of them just capture everything you copy, then become a cluttered dumping ground. Quip takes a very different approach.</p>
<p>Quip is a supercharged clipboard manager and text expander for Mac, iPhone, and iPad, designed to feel like a natural extension of the OS. It gives you full control over your clipboard history, syncs seamlessly across devices with iCloud, and introduces <strong>Super Shortcuts</strong>—a built-in text expansion system that lets you paste signatures, links, or entire snippets anywhere with a quick trigger.</p>
<p>But what really makes Quip unique is <strong>Quip Intelligence</strong>: secure, on-device AI that keeps your clipboard clean and useful. It fixes broken links, removes tracking junk, normalizes messy formatting, cleans up code blocks, avoids duplicates, and learns from you—all in real time, right on your device.</p>
<p>Whether you’re managing projects, writing code, or just copying links, Quip makes your clipboard fast, searchable, and surprisingly powerful.</p>
<p>You can try Quip free on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6711331483?pt=2138718&amp;ct=SixColors&amp;mt=8">App Store</a> or learn more at <a href="https://bzgapps.com/quip">bzgapps.com/quip</a>.</p>
