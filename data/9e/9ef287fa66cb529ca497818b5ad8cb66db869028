<p>The U.S. military says it seized two sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuelan crude in predawn operations on January 7—one in the North Atlantic (the Marinera, a ship that at points sailed under Panama’s and then Russia’s flag) and another in international waters near the Caribbean (the Sophia). U.S. officials describe the actions as part of a wider effort under President Trump to enforce sanctions and intensify a maritime blockade on Venezuelan oil shipments, with the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security involved and a federal court warrant cited in the Atlantic seizure. Russia condemned the action as illegal under freedom-of-navigation principles, while U.S. officials argue the tankers formed part of a “shadow/dark fleet” moving sanctioned oil, escalating already tense U.S.–Russia relations over maritime enforcement.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/0gczIKY_vYeN9v7gyzlba2shFg8nL7xjc7om6rkMPtZmUqgG9Ek3f8YCXGRoicXZquMUnCkyQscSkPwXup58c_Vw-z4snXqq4OBvOruM' alt='Undated handout photo released by the US European Command shows what it says is the seizure of the M/V Bella 1 oil tanker in the North Atlantic Ocean.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>UK support role: Britain’s Ministry of Defence confirmed UK armed forces provided support to the U.S. mission to seize the Russian-flagged tanker in the North Atlantic.</li><li>Prosecution pathway: The White House said the seized tanker had a judicial seizure order and that the crew could face prosecution under applicable U.S. federal law, with the possibility of being brought to the United States.</li><li>Chase and reflagging: Reporting on the pursuit says the ship originally known as Bella 1 fled a Coast Guard attempt to board it, later changed its name to Marinera and switched flags during the weeks-long chase, with Russia sending a diplomatic note demanding the pursuit stop and naval assets—including a submarine—moving to shadow the situation.</li><li>Oil-revenue plan: Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration intends to sell seized Venezuelan oil at market prices while the U.S. controls proceeds, describing this as leverage to prevent corruption and to support a U.S.-led “stabilization, recovery, transition” approach.</li><li>Market and supply context: Officials and analysts noted Venezuela holds the world’s largest proven oil reserves but currently contributes about 1% of global supply after years of underinvestment, a backdrop that shapes how much any export changes could influence prices.</li></ul><blockquote>The bottom line is that there is a process now in place where we have tremendous control and leverage over what those interim authorities are doing and are able to do - Marco Rubio</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. European Command (EUCOM) / U.S. government: The U.S. says it seized the tanker(s) pursuant to U.S. sanctions enforcement and a federal court warrant, framing the ships as part of a ‘shadow fleet’ moving sanctioned crude.
