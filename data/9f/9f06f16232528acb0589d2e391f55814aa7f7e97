<p>There’s an old adage in poker: If you look around the table and you can’t tell who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_poker_terms">the fish</a> is, that means you’re the fish.</p>

<p>If you’re surprised at how <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/01/apple-lost-but-did-epic-win">this publicity stunt</a> from Epic has turned out, especially if you’re a reporter and <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250430/p57#a250430p57">ran a piece</a> accepting Tim Sweeney’s word that Fortnite was — not <em>might be</em>, but was — coming back to the US App Store as a fact, then you are Tim Sweeney’s fish. </p>
