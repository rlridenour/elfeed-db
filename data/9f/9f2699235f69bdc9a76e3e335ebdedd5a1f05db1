Sorry for the missed posts. I&rsquo;ve been traveling. On a train. In coach. For about 30 hours. The itinerary didn&rsquo;t list it  but I&rsquo;m pretty sure we crossed the River Styx at one point. The person behind me was coughing her lungs out and now I have whatever she had and am coughing <i>my</i> lungs out.

Perhaps worst of all for a nerd is that WiFi (and even broadband) was spotty and at one point I had to ask the conductor to reset the router because it wouldn&rsquo;t complete connections. Oddly, she knew just what I meant and fixed that problem but the broadband—upon which, after all, the WiFi depends—was still unreliable along much of the route.

I&rsquo;m safely home now at the Irreal Bunker so normal blogging should resume.</p>
