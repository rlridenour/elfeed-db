<p>Japan’s parliament elected Sanae Takaichi as the country’s first female prime minister on Tuesday, concluding weeks of maneuvering after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) struck a new coalition with the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin) following the departure of longtime partner Komeito [apnews.com#2][time.com#1][euronews.com#1]. Takaichi succeeds Shigeru Ishiba, who resigned with his cabinet earlier in the day after the LDP’s poor showing in July triggered a three‑month political vacuum [apnews.com#2][scmp.com#2]. The LDP–Ishin alliance is expected to shift policy to the right, and it remains short of a clear majority in both chambers, meaning Takaichi will need to court additional groups to pass legislation [apnews.com#2][economist.com#1]. Markets responded optimistically, with Japanese stocks hitting record highs amid expectations for higher defense outlays and selective tax relief, while an early diplomatic test looms with a Tokyo summit this month with President Trump [ft.com#1][semafor.com#1][dawn.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/_re0kJmV_6s8pPW983bbMqnOjXKXmwqyumG3Ovh7x2ibwc22BL5BA6mKZcfbaRpAFJrbb3FWFQcDQlnflJWGv-H82f4E9fx_DJmLSGZY8-L1' alt='Sanae Takaichi bows after being selected as Japan’s new prime minister during a parliamentary session in Tokyo.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Cabinet makeup: Despite earlier pledges to mirror Nordic gender balance, Takaichi named only two women to her cabinet on day one [theguardian.com#1][ndtv.com#1].</li><li>Coalition terms: Ishin is pushing to scrap corporate and organizational donations, reduce the number of MPs, and cut the consumption tax on food to zero [dawn.com#1].</li><li>Vote mechanics: Takaichi won 237 of 465 votes in the lower house, and after falling one seat short in the first upper‑house round, she prevailed in a runoff [apnews.com#2][time.com#1].</li><li>Policy agenda: Her platform emphasizes a stronger military, fiscal spending for growth, nuclear fusion research, cybersecurity, and tougher immigration rules [apnews.com#1].</li><li>Economic headwinds: She inherits inflation above the Bank of Japan’s target and cooling growth, and must navigate Trump’s recent threats of steep tariffs on Japan [semafor.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>Tremendous news for the incredible people of Japan - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Sanae Takaichi: She emphasized that political stability is essential to deliver economic and diplomatic measures.
