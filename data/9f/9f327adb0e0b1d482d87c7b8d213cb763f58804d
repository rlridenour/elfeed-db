<p>For <a href="https://x.com/siracusa/status/544941900558761985">more than a decade</a>, we’ve all been wondering <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/10/17/instagram-ipad">why Instagram doesn’t have an iPad app</a>. I’m not sure we ever got a good answer—but earlier this year <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/08/instagram-ipad-app-in-development/">reports said one was coming</a>, and here we are—on Wednesday Instagram <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-for-ipad/">released an app update that supports the iPad</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When designing Instagram for iPad, we wanted to take advantage of the bigger screen to give people more features with fewer taps, while keeping it simple. We’ve made it easier to catch up on your messages and notifications with layouts that display both tabs. When you watch reels, you can expand the comments while the reel stays at full size, making it easy to catch up on the best reactions without missing a moment. It’s the Instagram you love, now with more space to play.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The app update is rolling out globally and works on iPads that support iPadOS 15.1 and later. Instagram says the tablet design will also follow for Android tablets.</p>
<p>While messages, notifications, and reels do feel more expansive on the new app, the standard view still feels… pretty empty. I’m glad the app is fully iPad native now, but it would sure be nice if Instagram considered what might be an elevated tablet experience. (I guess we can stop waiting for the app and start waiting for it to be better instead!)</p>
