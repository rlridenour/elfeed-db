The idea behind the ad is that Apple Arcade provides you with access to hundreds of games on the go, right on your iPhone, with a single subscription.<br/>
<br/>
"Bring hundreds of games with you," says Apple. "Fun for all. All on iPhone."<br/>
<br/>
Accessible through the App Store, Apple Arcade is a subscription-based service that provides access to hundreds of games across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro, all free of ads and in-app purchases. In the U.S., Apple Arcade costs &#36;6.99 per month, and it is bundled with other Apple services in all Apple One plans.<br/>
