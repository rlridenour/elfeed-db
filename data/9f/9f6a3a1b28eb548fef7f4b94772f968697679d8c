<p>Tina Nguyen at The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I interviewed an enthusiastic crypto trader who figured out how to
win the contest without losing any money: buy enough $TRUMP to get
onto the leaderboard — and then in a separate wallet on a
separate exchange, buy $TRUMP perpetual futures that would be
profitable if (or as he saw it, when) the value of $TRUMP dropped.
Yes, he did The Big Short, except with Donald Trump’s meme coin.
“Bet you 10 percent of dinner participants are doing this,” he
told me before the contest ended. “Everyone knows $TRUMP price
will fall inevitably as more supply comes online in the future and
gets dumped on retail.”</p>

<p>Fascinating interview — half hilarious, half infuriating.</p>
