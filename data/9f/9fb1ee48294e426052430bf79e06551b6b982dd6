<p>Jason Fried:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what’s the net effect of this tiny little design detail that
the owner may not even understand? Well, it looks like the watch
is already half-way out of power after the first day, so <em>it
encourages the owner to wind the watch more frequently</em>. To keep
it closer to topped off, even when it’s not necessary. This helps
prevent the watch from running out of power, losing time, and,
ultimately, stopping. A stopped watch may be right twice a day,
but it’s rarely at the times you want.</p>

<p>Small detail, material behavior change. Well considered, well
executed, well done.</p>
