Their project is called &#8220;From Campus to Community: Civil Discourse as a Catalyst for Local Civic Renewal&#8221;.</p>
<p>Professor Bruner writes that &#8220;the SUNY [State University of New York] system has adopted a civil discourse curricular requirement, so this grant is an opportunity to get students into contact with issues in social epistemology, political epistemology, and of course social and political philosophy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of the grant goes towards curricular development, which will include, according to a <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2026/01/bruner-ppe-civil-discourse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> about the grant, &#8220;three new undergraduate courses on free expression and civil discourse; a new certificate program in civil discourse and civic leadership; as well as an executive education program for civic leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project will also include &#8220;a longitudinal study on the social norms of civil discourse to be conducted during the grant period.&#8221;</p>
