<p id="p1">I came across <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/how-to-enable-120hz-mode-in-safari-mac-iphone-and-ipad/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this incredible tip by Matt Birchler</a> a few weeks ago and forgot to link it on MacStories:</p>

  Today I learned something amazing: Safari supports higher than 60Hz refresh. It’s the only mainstream web browser that doesn’t, and I have never understood why, but apparently as of the end of 2025 in Safari version 26.3 (and maybe earlier) you can enable it. Here’s how to do it.

<p id="p3">I won’t paste the steps here, so you’ll have to click through and visit Matt’s website (I keep recommending his work, and he’s doing some <em>really</em> <a href="https://birchtree.me/tag/micro-apps/" rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting work with “micro apps” lately</a>). I can’t believe this feature is disabled by default on iOS and iPadOS; I turned it on several days ago, and it made browsing with Safari significantly nicer.</p>
<p id="p4">Also new to me: I discovered <a href="https://testufo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this outstandingly weird website</a> that lets you test your browser’s refresh and frame rates. Just trust me and click through that as well – what a great way to show people who “don’t see” refresh rates what they actually feel like in practice.</p>
