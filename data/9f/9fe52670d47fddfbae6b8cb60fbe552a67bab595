While the more personalized version of Siri is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">infamously delayed</a>, Apple Intelligence will continue to evolve in other ways in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>

In a later-than-usual Monday edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-05/apple-s-make-or-break-moment-with-tariffs-ai-google-deal-epic-games-lawsuit-mab141ke"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman outlined two additional Apple Intelligence enhancements that are likely planned for the upcoming iOS 18.6 and iOS 19 software updates.<br/>
<br/>
First, he expects iOS 18.6 to enable Apple Intelligence in China, with Alibaba and Baidu set to power some of the features in that country.<br/>
<br/>
Second, he said that iOS 19 will include new Apple Intelligence capabilities, although he did not provide any specific details. In court, Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently suggested that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/ios-19-google-gemini-integration-likely/">iOS 19 may include Google Gemini integration</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone models with Apple Intelligence have already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-2-iphone-chatgpt-integration/">offered ChatGPT integration since iOS 18.2</a>. With user permission, Siri can show ChatGPT answers directly in response to questions and other prompts. ChatGPT is also an option for Apple's system-wide Writing Tools feature, allowing users to generate text and images. Google Gemini would likely have similar integration across Siri and Writing Tools, becoming a second option alongside ChatGPT.<br/>
<br/>
Google Gemini is already available <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-gemini/id6477489729">as an iPhone app</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence is available on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and all iPhone 16 models, plus select iPads and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.6 beta testing should begin later this month. After that, Apple is expected to announce iOS 19 during its annual developers conference WWDC, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/">kicks off Monday, June 9</a>. The first iOS 19 beta should be seeded to developers shortly after the keynote, and the software update should be released to the general public in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-intelligence-features-ios-18-6-ios-19/">Apple Intelligence to Evolve in Two Ways Across iOS 18.6 and iOS 19</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-to-evolve-in-two-ways-across-ios-18-6-and-ios-19.2456543/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
