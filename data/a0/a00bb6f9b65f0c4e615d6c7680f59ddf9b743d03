<p>French police are pursuing thieves after a daylight robbery at Paris’s Louvre on Sunday, when a team entered through an upstairs window and stole historic French crown jewels before fleeing; the operation lasted about seven minutes [dawn.com#1][straitstimes.com#1][cbsnews.com#1]. Investigators closed the museum on Monday and assigned 60 officers to probe possible organised-crime links while combing camera footage from the area and highway exits [dawn.com#1][nytimes.com#4]. Interior Minister Laurent Nunez ordered tighter protection of cultural sites as a Court of Auditors report described persistent delays in security upgrades at the Louvre, and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin acknowledged failures [dawn.com#1][nytimes.com#1]. Experts warn recovery may be difficult because jewel gangs often break pieces into components for resale; during the escape, a diamond-studded crown was dropped on a Paris street [scmp.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][dawn.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ZAa4TdASRK7qKEMUvsQVD8lVWxUl3q2g7-4gtHBZ7dHjsxT2S56JLvB05j4UxFXWHtiP7U1q6bQ32QQkOBg2nCzH65x_2hN1NbRvgjijcliU' alt='Empress Eugénie’s crown, targeted in the heist and dropped during the escape, shown in a museum video still.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Video trail: Investigators are reviewing CCTV from in and around the Louvre and along main highways out of Paris, with officials noting there are &quot;a lot of videos&quot; to analyse [dawn.com#1].</li><li>Surveillance gaps: A Court of Auditors review found persistent delays in upgrades, leaving only a quarter of one wing under video surveillance at the time of the raid [dawn.com#1].</li><li>Entry tools: Thieves used a basket lift/extendable ladder to reach an upper window, smashed display cases with cutting tools, and even left some tools at the scene [cbsnews.com#1][cbsnews.com#2][firstpost.com#2][dawn.com#1].</li><li>Heritage stakes: Historian Eric Anceau said the theft is more serious than the 1911 Mona Lisa case because it targeted crown jewels embodying national history [lemonde.fr#1].</li><li>Public reaction: Anger grew among Parisians and visitors as details about security lapses emerged, with some describing the situation as &quot;a joke&quot; [npr.org#1].</li></ul><blockquote>What is certain is that we have failed, since people were able to park a furniture hoist in the middle of Paris, get people up it in several minutes to grab priceless jewels, giving France a terrible image - Gérald Darmanin</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>French Justice Ministry: Acknowledged security failures at the Louvre and said the burglary harmed France’s image.
