<p>While at Eton, Winston Churchill&#8217;s son Randolph was &#8220;immensely impressed&#8221; to hear his friend Freddie Furneaux recite the following passage without notes. Ostensibly it describes Henry VIII:</p>
<p>&#8220;This monarch was sincere, open, gallant, liberal, intrepid, inflexible and courageous; but with these virtues he combined the vices of violence, cruelty, profusion, rapacity, obstinacy, injustice, arrogance, presumption and conceit.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Churchill asked the source of the quotation, Furneaux said, &#8220;I had it from the headmaster of my private school, but he did not disclose where it came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s from Churchill&#8217;s 1965 autobiography <a href="https://archive.org/details/twentyoneyears210000rand/page/34/mode/2up"><em>Twenty-One Years</em></a>. The only other mention I can find is in Linda Kelly&#8217;s 2017 commonplace book <a href="https://archive.org/details/consolationscomm0000kell/page/n21/mode/2up"><em>Consolations</em></a>, where she calls it a memory test and adds, &#8220;The test is to recite it by heart after looking at it once.&#8221; That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve managed to learn.</p>
<p>05/22/2025 UPDATE: Reader Charlotte Fare found a variant of the quote in <a href="https://www.humanitiesweb.org/spa/icp/ID/25308">Volume III</a> of David Hume&#8217;s <em>History of England</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A catalogue of his vices would comprehend many of the worst qualities incident to human nature: Violence, cruelty, profusion, rapacity, injustice, obstinacy, arrogance, bigotry, presumption, caprice: But neither was he subject to all these vices in the most extreme degree, nor was he, at intervals altogether destitute of virtues: He was sincere, open, gallant, liberal, and capable at least of a temporary friendship and attachment.
</p></blockquote>
<p>(Thanks, Charlotte.)</p>
