<p>I am just at the moment reflecting on how my experience with Emacs over the last 30 years has evolved.  I thought that just for fun I would list all the key moments along my Emacs journey regarding work-flow efficiency breakthroughs, roughly in year order!.</p>
<p>I think you can see that my investment of time has spiked in recent years, probably spurred on by writing this blog!</p>
<p>Firstly I went through the barren years&hellip; :</p>

<p>and then when I started to get a little more serious about Emacs :</p>

<p>Note that I have endeavoured to incorporate some level of completion framework into my work-flow, systems such as <strong>company</strong> and <strong>corfu</strong> but I always end up just using hippie-expand wrapped around dabbrev.</p>
<p>I think this is why I have always been drawn to Emacs, it is just me and a text editor, there is no clutter and no distractions, although there is so much more to Emacs than just a text editor, everything else is hidden away.  I don&rsquo;t really want inline completion popups as I type, I don&rsquo;t need a menu bar, scroll bars, a source code tree and I tend to always work on a single monitor so the saving on screen real estate is very beneficial to the way I work.</p>
<p>I am a Software Engineer now of 30 years, I am stuck in my ways, stuck with Emacs, but I am happy, productive and efficient!</p>
<p>P.S. and yes I&rsquo;m starting to play around with plantuml 🙂</p>
