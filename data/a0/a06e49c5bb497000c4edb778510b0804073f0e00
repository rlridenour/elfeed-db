Intro For a better development experience I needed to set up Wordpress locally on my Tumbleweed machine, which was somewhat different than the Ubuntu that I brought the site from. It wasn&rsquo;t really 500 steps, but does have some gotchas and require some time to get right.
Prerequisites  Have a version of the WordPress site running somewhere on server that you can access. You need a mysqldump of its db and a copy of its complete file structure.
