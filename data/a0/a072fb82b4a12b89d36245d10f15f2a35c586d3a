<p id="p2">Earlier this year, Apple selected 350 students from around the world as winners of its annual Swift Student Challenge. From that talented pool, Apple picks 50 Distinguished Winners whose projects stand out from the others. Today, Apple highlighted the work of four of them: Taiki Hamamoto, Marina Lee, Luciana Ortiz Nolasco, and Nahom Worku.</p>

<p id="p4">Taiki Hamamoto built an app playground to teach people about the Hanafuda, a Japanese card game that he discovered many of his friends didn&rsquo;t know. According to Apple&rsquo;s press release:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  While Hamamoto stayed true to the game&rsquo;s classic floral iconography, he also added a modern touch to the gameplay experience, incorporating video game concepts like hit points (HP) that resonate with younger generations. SwiftUI&rsquo;s DragGesture helped him implement dynamic, highly responsive effects like cards tilting and glowing during movement, making the gameplay feel natural and engaging. He&rsquo;s also experimenting with making Hanafuda Tactics playable on Apple Vision Pro.

<p id="p7">Marina Lee, is a computer science student at the University of Southern California. A call from her grandmother who was alerted to evacuate her home because of wildfires in the L.A. area inspired Lee to create EvacuMate to help users prepare an emergency checklist in case of evacuations like her grandmother&rsquo;s. In addition:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote8"><p>
  Lee integrated the iPhone camera roll into the app so users can upload copies of important documents, and added the ability to import emergency contacts through their iPhone contacts list. She also included resources on topics like checking air quality levels and assembling a first-aid kit.

<p id="p10">Luciana Ortiz Nolasco built BreakDownCosmic:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote11"><p>
  a virtual gathering place where users can add upcoming astronomical events around the world to their calendars, earn medals for accomplishing &ldquo;missions,&rdquo; and chat with fellow astronomers about what they see.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p12">Ortiz Nolasco who is 15 and from Nuevo Le&oacute;n, Mexico will attend WWDC with the other Distinguished Student Winners and plans to continue work on BreakDownCosmic when she returns home with the goal of releasing it on the App Store.</p>

<p id="p14">Nahom Worku grew up in Ethiopia and Canada and learned to code during the pandemic. Worku&rsquo;s submission for the Swift Student Challenge app playground, AccessEd, is designed to offer educational resources in places where Internet connectivity doesn&rsquo;t exist or is spotty.</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote15"><p>
  Built using Apple&rsquo;s machine learning and AI tools, such as Core ML and the Natural Language framework, the app recommends courses based on a student&rsquo;s background, creating a truly personalized experience.

<p id="p16">Congratulations to all of this year&rsquo;s Swift Student Challenge winners. I&rsquo;m always impressed with <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/swift-student-challenge/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the projects we&rsquo;ve learned about</a> through Apple&rsquo;s press releases and past interviews we&rsquo;ve done on AppStories. It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to watch a new generation of kids learn to code and become the developers whose apps I know we&rsquo;ll cover in coming years on MacStories.</p>
