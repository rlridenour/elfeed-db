<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 2 Pro license ($99 value each) for <a href="https://www.zengobi.com/curio/">Curio</a>. That&rsquo;s right, another chance at Curio, just in time for the Curio 31 release! Curio is the perfect app for managing your brainstorms, your research, your projects, and your digital life. A Curio &ldquo;space&rdquo; is a blank canvas onto which you can add notes, web pages, pdfs, images, mind maps, outlines, and more. All searchable and linkable, and even shareable.</p>

<p>The latest version is freshly out and ready to take it to the next level. It includes multiple AI integrations to assist with research, and adds even more Markdown goodness, including Markdown task lists and TSV to table conversion!</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take notes. Organize files. Collect research. Brainstorm in mind maps. Track tasks with to-do lists or Kanban stacks. Drop in an equation. Sketch out an idea. Get more productive! Curio’s intuitive, freeform notebook environment provides all the integrated tools you need to be more productive and focus on getting things done.</p>
