<li>Provides compression for the knee, elbow, or foot</li>
<li>The foot ones are socks</li>
<li>Interesting packaging design, but the sleeves themselves look pretty normal and good</li>
<li>Are they available in Georgia Red: if only!</li>
</ul><h1>Sore All Over</h1><p>Why am I walking with this limp?</p>
<p>Oh, it’s actually sorta complicated.</p>
<p>You see, I left the dishwasher open, and then, at night, I got up for a glass of water, and knocked my right shin into it in the dark.</p>
<p>What do you mean, ‘that’s not complicated’? That’s because you didn’t let me finish.</p>
<p>Anyway, next day the shin was pretty raw, but I went for a run anyway. Naturally, I favored my opposite leg, which led me to strain a muscle in that thigh. Next day after that, I favored the <em>other</em> side, the sore shin side, leading to some tightness in my <em>that</em> knee.</p>
<p>Well, after all that, I decided to take a few days off from running. And things were healing up nicely.</p>
<p>Then, I rolled my ankle a clump of uneven ground while mowing.</p>
<p>So, yeah, that’s why I’m walking with a little limp. But maybe you were right; it’s not actually very complicated.</p>
<p>Okay, are we laying it on a little thick?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But the point stands: if you’ve got a body, that means you’ve got a part of your body that hurts. And if that pain is radiating or severe, call a doctor, obviously. But sometimes, the discomfort is mild but persistent, and you just need a little bit of pressure and lift to make it feel better.</p>
<p>That’s where compression comes in! Whether you need it on your shoulder, your elbow, or your feet, these sleeves and socks can deliver a nice bit of support and comfort when you’re hurting or sore.</p>
<p>[<em>And here is where I admit something embarrassing as a professional copywriter. Being a person who has a body, I’m familiar with compression sleeves/socks and didn’t think to really check what these particular ones offered before beginning my work. And so, I am only now seeing packaging.</em>]</p>
<p>Hmmm…</p>
<p><em>Deep sigh</em></p>
<p>Well, shit.</p>
<p>Okay, so, reading the company’s ‘about us’ page, when they say ‘front line,’ they really do mean it. The company supports a variety of charitable foundations that benefit medical professionals and first-responders, military personnel, and police forces, providing them with compression products for use in the field.</p>
<p>Still, the design is… a choice.</p>
<p>But it’s just on the packaging. So you can buy the compression product of your choice <em>for</em> their design, or you can buy it <em>in spite</em> of their design and then toss the packaging as soon as your order arrives.</p>
<p>Because the sleeves and socks? They’re good.</p>
<p>Buy them if you want them.</p>
