<p>The <code>dir-config</code> Emacs package automatically loads and evaluates Elisp code from a <code>.dir-config.el</code> file found in the buffer&#8217;s current directory or its closest parent directory. This facilitates adjusting settings or executing functions specific to the directory structure of each buffer.</p>
<p>For instance, you can use the <code>dir-config</code> package to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configure project-specific settings</strong>: Automatically set up environment variables, keybindings, or modes unique to each project.</li>
<li><strong>Apply directory-specific customizations</strong>: Set specific behaviors or preferences for files in different directories, such as enabling or disabling certain minor modes based on security considerations. For example, you might disable linters that execute code in directories where you handle untrusted code.</li>
<li><strong>Manage multiple environments</strong>: Switch between different coding environments or workflows by loading environment-specific configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this enhances your workflow, please show your support by <strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> starring dir-config on GitHub</strong> to help more Emacs users discover its benefits.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic Configuration Discovery: Searches for and loads <code>.dir-config.el</code> file from the directory of the current buffer or its parent directories.</li>
<li>Selective Directory Loading: Restricts the loading of configuration files to directories listed in the variable <code>dir-config-allowed-directories</code>, ensuring control over where configuration files are sourced from.</li>
<li>The <code>dir-config-mode</code> mode: Automatically loads the <code>.dir-config.el</code> file whenever a file or directory is opened, leveraging the <code>find-file-hook</code> to ensure that the dir configurations are applied.</li>
<li>The <code>.dir-config.el</code> file name can be changed by modifying the <code>dir-config-file-names</code> defcustom.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Install with straight</h3>
<p>To install <code>dir-config</code> from MELPA:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already done so, <a href="https://melpa.org/#/getting-started">add MELPA repository to your Emacs configuration</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the following code to your Emacs init file to install <code>dir-config</code> from MELPA:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(use-package dir-config
:ensure t
:custom
(dir-config-file-names '(".dir-config.el"))
(dir-config-allowed-directories '("~/src" "~/projects"))
:config
(dir-config-mode))</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dir-config file names can be customized by modifying the dir-config-file-names variable. For instance: <code>(setq dir-config-file-names '(".project-config.el" ".dir-config.el"))</code> will make <code>dir-config</code> search for the <code>.project-config.el</code> file first, and if it is not found, it will then search for the <code>.dir-config.el</code> file&#8217;.</li>
<li>You can set <code>(setq dir-config-verbose t)</code> and <code>(setq dir-config-debug t)</code> to increase the verbosity of messages each time a file is loaded while <code>dir-config-mode</code> is active.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example usage</h2>
<p>Assuming that the <code>dir-config</code> package has been configured to allow loading configuration files from specific directories, such as <code>~/src</code>, by setting the <code>dir-config-allowed-directories</code> variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(setq dir-config-allowed-directories '("~/src" "~/projects"))</code></pre>
<p>Adding the following code to the <code>~/src/my_python_project/.dir-config.el</code> file can modify the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable for Python buffers within its directory or one of its subdirectories (e.g., <code>~/src/my_python_project/my_python_project/file.py</code>). Modifying <code>PYTHONPATH</code> ensures that processes executed by tools like Flycheck or Flymake have access to the Python project&#8217;s modules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">;;; .dir-config.el --- Directory config -*- no-byte-compile: t; lexical-binding: t; -*-
(when (or (derived-mode-p 'python-ts-mode) (derived-mode-p 'python-mode))
  (let ((python-path (getenv "PYTHONPATH"))
        (dir (dir-config-get-dir)))
    ;; Update the PYTHONPATH environment variable to ensure that Flycheck,
    ;; Flymake, and other subprocesses can locate the Python modules.
    (when (and dir (or (file-exists-p (expand-file-name "setup.py" dir))
                       (file-exists-p (expand-file-name "pyproject.toml" dir))))
      (setq-local process-environment (copy-sequence process-environment))
      (setenv "PYTHONPATH" (concat dir (when python-path (concat ":" python-path)))))))</code></pre>
<p>It is recommended to always begin your <code>.dir-config.el</code> files with the following header:</p>
<pre><code>;;; .dir-config.el --- Directory config -*- no-byte-compile: t; lexical-binding: t; -*-</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dir-config</code> package allows for automatic application of specific configurations based on the directory of the files being accessed, enhancing the flexibility and customization of the Emacs environment.</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>How to Disable <code>.dir-locals.el</code></h3>
<p>By default, Emacs loads <code>.dir-locals.el</code> from the current directory or its parent directories, applying project-specific settings such as indentation, compilation commands, or custom minor modes. While useful in many cases, this behavior can lead to unintended overrides.</p>
<p>If you prefer to disable <code>.dir-locals.el</code>, you can do so by setting <code>enable-dir-local-variables</code> to <code>nil</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(setq enable-dir-local-variables nil)</code></pre>
<p>Disabling <code>.dir-locals.el</code> ensures that only the <code>.dir-config.el</code> files managed by this package are loaded, creating a more controlled and consistent configuration environment.</p>
<h3>How does .dir-config.el files compare to .dir-locals.el?</h3>
<p>Here is the difference between with <code>.dir-locals.el</code> and the <code>.dir-config.el</code> files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>.dir-locals.el</code> (built-in):</p>
<ul>
<li>Primarily used for setting per-directory local variables (static).</li>
<li>The syntax of <code>.dir-locals.el</code> relies heavily on nested lists and alist structures which can quickly become difficult to read and maintain.</li>
<li>The configuration in <code>dir-locals.el</code> is inherently static unless dynamic behavior is explicitly added using <code>eval</code>. Here is an example of <code>.dir-locals.el</code>:<pre><code>((nil . ((eval . (progn
                   (setq-local my-variable t)
                   (message "Hello world"))))))</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Only a single <code>.dir-locals.el</code> file can be specified by modifying the <code>dir-locals-file</code> variable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>.dir-config.el</code> (this package):</p>
<ul>
<li>Loads and evaluates Emacs Lisp code (dynamic by default).</li>
<li><code>.dir-config.el</code> files are easier to maintain, as they use standard Elisp code instead of nested alists.</li>
<li>Allows specifying multiple <code>.dir-config.el</code> file names by adding them to the <code>dir-config-file-names</code> list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to move .dir-config.el Elisp code into Emacs init?</h3>
<p>Dir config files (<code>.dir-config.el</code>) offer advantages for managing complex directory-specific configurations that require dynamic logic. They allow projects or directories to define their needs, providing flexibility to customize configurations to specific requirements.</p>
<p>For example, one of the author&#8217;s use cases is to use <code>dir-config.el</code> to enable Emacs features only in trusted directories while keeping these features disabled by default (for security reasons, some code linters need to be disabled by default because they evaluate code).</p>
<p>While this code could be included in the author&#8217;s init file, he prefers to keep the init file as a general editor configuration without project-specific details. Since the author uses multiple machines for various purposes, he finds it more straightforward to let the filesystem hierarchy (e.g., a Git repository or a project directory) determine the specific settings for each directory or project using <code>.dir-config.el</code>.</p>
