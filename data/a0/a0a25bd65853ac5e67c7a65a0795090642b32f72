<p id="p4"><a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/08/st-jude-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As Stephen Hackett explains on 512 Pixels</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  [St. Jude] is leading the way the world understands, treats and defeats childhood cancer, and other life-threatening diseases. If that sounds expensive, it&rsquo;s because it is, but the bill isn&rsquo;t passed to the families of patients. At St. Jude, no child is denied treatment based on race, religion or a family&rsquo;s ability to pay.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">Relay, which has raised over $4 million for St. Jude over the years, will be raising money through the end of September. Thanks in advance for checking out <a href="https://relay.experience.stjude.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relay&rsquo;s fundraiser for St. Jude</a> and to all who donate.</p>
