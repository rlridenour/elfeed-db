<p>WhatsApp, on their official blog back in April 2023:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last year, we introduced the ability for users globally to
<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/14/security/whatsapp-multi-device/">message seamlessly across all their devices</a>, while
maintaining the same level of privacy and security.</p>

<p>Today, we’re improving our multi-device offering further by
<em>introducing the ability to use the same WhatsApp account on
multiple phones</em>.</p>

<p>A feature highly requested by users, now you can link your phone
as one of up to four additional devices, the same as when you link
with WhatsApp on <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/">web browsers</a>, <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download">tablets and desktops</a>.
Each linked phone connects to WhatsApp independently, ensuring
that your personal messages, media, and calls are end-to-end
encrypted, and if your primary device is inactive for a long
period, we automatically log you out of all companion devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I wrote about WhatsApp <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/02/whatsapp-for-ipad">finally shipping for iPad earlier this week</a>, I mentioned that you couldn’t use a secondary phone as a linked device to your primary phone. That used to be true, but obviously, I missed that this changed two years ago. Glad to know it. I’ve already added my Android burner and my spare iPhone that I use for summer iOS betas. <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/1317564962315842/?cms_platform=android">WhatsApp has a support document on linking devices</a> that explains the somewhat hidden way you do this with a secondary phone. My thanks to several readers who pointed me to this.</p>

<p>This makes it seem all the more spiteful, though, that Meta didn’t allow the iPhone version of WhatsApp to run on iPads (like they do with the still-iPhone-only Instagram app). I heard from a little birdie this week — second- or maybe even third-hand, so take it with a grain of salt — that Meta had this WhatsApp for iPad version ready to go for a while, and has been more or less sitting on an iPad version of Instagram, as a couple negotiating chits with Apple. Negotiating for what, I don’t know. But if that’s true, perhaps some (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/04/meta-and-yandexs-local-mess-exploit-seemingly-only-works-on-android">but definitely not all</a>) of the ice has thawed between the two companies. I don’t see it happening, but it sure would get a big audience response if Instagram for iPad got some sort of announcement during the WWDC keynote, perhaps as part of an “<em>iPadOS is now a fuller, more complete, computing experience than ever</em>” segment.</p>

<p>One other oddity I encountered, when adding my Android phone as a linked device: by design, <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/5550163238402916">there is no way to sign out of WhatsApp on your primary iOS or Android device</a>. If you are signed in to WhatsApp using another phone number, the only way to sign out on that device and then set it up as a linked device to your primary WhatsApp account is to delete WhatsApp from your phone and reinstall it. Weird.</p>
