<p>The <a href="https://www.themorgan.org/music-manuscripts-and-printed-music/115316">manuscript</a> for Mozart&#8217;s Horn Concerto No. 4 in E-Flat Major, K. 495, is written in inks of four colors, red, green, blue, and black.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why. Possibly the composer was teasing his friend Joseph Leutgeb, the intended performer. But possibly it&#8217;s a code meant to inform the performance.</p>
