<p>Well, I ran for a couple of weeks in the Texas heat, went too hard, got injured, and stopped running in 2021.</p>
<p>In early 2022, I tried again and, for the first time in my life, an exercise habit stuck. I'll write more about it at some stage, as (a) I'm actually quite proud of my progress, (b) it might be helpful to someone, and (c) it's just about the only thing I discuss with other adults at this point in my life.</p>
<p>I ran my first marathon in December 2023 and my second in April 2024. I'm now gearing up to run the 2025 TCS London Marathon on April 27.</p>
