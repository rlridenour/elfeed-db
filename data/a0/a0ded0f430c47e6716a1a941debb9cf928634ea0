<p>Bill Gates has softened the alarmist tone he used for years on climate change, warning against a “doomsday view” and urging more practical priorities as world leaders prepare for COP30 in Brazil . In a 17-page memo intended to influence next month’s U.N. climate conference, he argues leaders should prioritize reducing human suffering by focusing on health, poverty and development alongside climate action . Gates also highlighted that low-income countries will bear the harshest impacts of warming, and urged policymakers to consider whether limited climate funds are being deployed where they help people most .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Ejd1F5jZCr6qXQZaVtxr9CkxAW-5YZ6HErngK6hY0ab68FNGjYuIRRCE2F9VdBXXkS5-iqWFaR-Ddv7xgG5Vq0n_ljtmpmhI57U4yNY2yZzdFHkJa6m7m-7PPNAx11XHQHbxauMIrIe0zTtF6AzsM2E9JwGuLDONRWd02SixPoIAyRWWSL9lfdPhBmslVeQK5zN3h5E' alt='Bill Gates: coverage of his remarks that climate change will not end humanity' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Funding priorities: Gates asks leaders to scrutinize whether the relatively small amounts currently earmarked for climate are being spent on the most effective interventions to reduce suffering and build resilience .</li><li>Messaging change: After decades of warnings, Gates now warns that persistent doomsday framing can be counterproductive and may undermine practical policy choices .</li><li>Civilization claim: Gates wrote that climate change &#x27;won’t end civilisation&#x27; and framed the problem as one of avoidable human suffering rather than inevitable global collapse .</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Bill Gates: Gates calls for a shift in climate emphasis from solely curbing emissions to prioritizing actions that reduce human suffering, especially in poorer countries, in a memo aimed at COP30 .
