<p>Susan Glasser, writing for The New Yorker, “Donald Trump’s Ego Melts the Global Economy”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this new political moment of the unthinkable made manifest, the
sheer power rush for Trump should also not be underestimated.
Imagine his joy as he sat down to sign an executive order
decreeing the new tariffs on the basis of sweeping powers he may
or may not legally possess to declare a “national economic
emergency” — here was Trump transforming the world with a single
flourish of his Sharpie pen. “It’s such an honor to be finally
able to do this,” he said. At what other moment in modern times
has a single man wielded so much unaccountable power over such a
large swath of the world economy? There are whole businesses
devoted to risk analysis for corporations; this is a situation in
which Trump himself is the risk and the crisis being analyzed is
one that he created. Talk about an ego trip.</p>

<p>Glasser links to <a href="https://x.com/Kasparov63/status/1907798003236188169">Garry Kasparov, on X</a>, responding to Wall Street’s collective surprise that Trump did what he’s been saying he would do re: tariff policy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I’ve said for years about Putin, and which applies to other
autocratic personalities like Trump: “Dictators always lie about
what they’ve done, but are often quite plain about what they want
to do.” “Trump would never...” is the new “Putin would never...”</p>

<p>Such people do and take whatever they can, unless they are
stopped. That they don’t always succeed does not mean they were
not sincere in their ambitions and won’t keep trying to fulfill
them. Trump has only been emboldened by the sycophantic GOP this
time around.</p>

<p>Even more apt, “Deep Throat” explaining the central truth of the Watergate scandal to Bob Woodward in the Alan-Pakula-directed / William-Goldman-written film adaptation of <em><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/891-all-the-president-s-men?language=en-US">All the President’s Men</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Forget the myths the media has created about the White House.
The truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out
of hand.”</p>
