I&rsquo;ve used LaTeX for years as my document production system, so that I need not bother with word processors. I write letters, papers, homework, dissertations, and presentations in it. For the past couple years, though, I&rsquo;ve been shifting all these to org-mode, which I find much simpler for managing my materials and exporting to LaTeX (as well as anything else). However, now I am back to working on academic papers collaboratively.
