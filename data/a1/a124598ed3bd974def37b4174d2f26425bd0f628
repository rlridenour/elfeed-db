The other day, in response to my <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12833">The Power Of Elfeed</a> post, René Trappel wrote to me offline about his Elfeed package <a href="https://github.com/rtrppl/cuckoo-search/blob/main/cuckoo-search.el">that enables content search</a>. He calls his package &ldquo;Cuckoo Search&rdquo; for reasons you can discover at his Github repository.

By default, Elfeed doesn&rsquo;t search the content of a post, just the metadata such as title, date, and tags. With Trappel&rsquo;s package you can do finer searches. If you often want to do fine grained searches for posts that previously appeared in your feed, take a look at Trappel&rsquo;s package.

I&rsquo;ve always found the default search adequate but it&rsquo;s easy to imagine needing the additional capability offered by Cuckoo Search. The package is not yet available in ELPA but Trappel gives a recipe for installing it directly from his Github repository. I&rsquo;ll probably wait until it appears on ELPA to install it unless I find myself needing its capability in the mean time.</p>
