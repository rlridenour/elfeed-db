<p>I feel I&rsquo;ve been singing praises for Kagi for a week now, but I keep rediscovering new things. This time, Kagi Small Web (I&rsquo;ll call it KSW here).</p>
<p>I have its RSS feed added to my <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/09/04/freshrss-is-up-kinda.html">FreshRSS server</a>, but it&rsquo;s too much information, so I usually turn it off when I read my feeds. This has been a kind of mistake. The RSS feed from KSW <em>is</em> overwhelming (there are days I get over 30 new articles, and I get them every day), but at the same time, it&rsquo;s very much worthwhile - if you consume it correctly.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://kagi.com/smallweb">website</a> directly is the right answer.</p>
<p>First, you only see one post at a time. It&rsquo;s up to you to decide if to keep looking or not. Second, many websites don&rsquo;t show correctly in the RSS feed, and you have to open them individually. Third, seeing the website at least once &ldquo;in the flesh&rdquo; is a good idea: is it a blog? a homepage for a group somewhere? Are there weird ads in the middle? When was the last post before the one you&rsquo;re seeing now? These are good questions to have in mind when touring the small web in general. Besides, the themes/colors/fonts are part of the point.</p>
<p>What surprised me today is the features they&rsquo;ve built into KSW&rsquo;s website. Take a look at this header (click the image to see it full size and follow the explanations):</p>

<p>From left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next Post</strong>: this takes you to another post on a <em>new</em> website. I think it should just say &ldquo;next.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>👍</strong>: this &ldquo;appriciates&rdquo; the post you&rsquo;re reading, kind of like upvoting.</li>
<li><strong>Smiley face thingi</strong>: allows you to choose an emoji for your upvoting.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong>: to comment about the page you&rsquo;re reading, goes to KSW community of readers, I guess</li>
<li><strong>The site&rsquo;s URL</strong>: takes you to the page, so you don&rsquo;t have this nav bar on top</li>
<li><strong>Share, Flag, Appreciate, Videos, Comics</strong>: The first two are actions; to share the post using different methods, and to Flag it for KSW admins, I&rsquo;m assuming. The other words are filters: you can view other Appreciated (&ldquo;thumbed up&rdquo; or &ldquo;liked&rdquo;) pages, or you can view independent videos (from YouTube). And then we have a nice Comics category as well.</li>
<li><strong>Moon</strong> darkmode, or at least it&rsquo;s trying to darkmode the page. It will switch to a sun icon when selected to go back to light mode.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong>: this searches a topic in KSW. I had success with searching for &ldquo;Emacs&rdquo; for example, but less with &ldquo;vegan.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t always work.</li>
<li><strong>Use Kagi</strong>: Opens the Kagi search page</li>
<li><strong>Contribute</strong> Takes you to the KSW GitHub page (yes, it&rsquo;s open source)</li>
<li><strong>About</strong>: I should have started reading this first. But it&rsquo;s your usual about page.</li>
</ul>
<p>As it turns out, this is a more human project than I realized, and it&rsquo;s curated by people. They&rsquo;ve added <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/blob/main/smallweb.txt">16,662</a> sites(!) at the time of this writing and counting.</p>
