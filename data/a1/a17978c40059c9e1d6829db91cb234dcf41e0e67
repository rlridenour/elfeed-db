<p>This <a href="https://www.bzgapps.com/quip">week&#8217;s sponsor is Quip</a>, and it&#8217;s different from every other clipboard manager I&#8217;ve tried.</p>



<p>Most clipboard managers work the same way: they save everything you copy, and after a few days, you&#8217;re scrolling through a junk drawer of random text snippets, URLs you&#8217;ll never visit again, and those annoying 2FA codes that somehow stick around forever. Quip solves this with something BZG Apps calls &#8220;Quip Intelligence&#8221;—completely local AI that keeps your clipboard history actually useful.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what that means in practice. The app automatically removes duplicate entries so you&#8217;re not seeing the same email address five times. It strips tracking parameters from URLs before saving them. It filters out those temporary authentication codes that would otherwise clutter your history. And it learns from your behavior to skip the stuff you never actually reuse. All of this happens on your device, so nothing leaves your Mac, iPhone, or iPad.</p>



<p>What really stands out is the Smart Collections feature. You can set up rules that automatically organize your clipboard items—all your code snippets in one collection, research links in another, client email addresses in a third. The app handles the sorting, so you can actually find what you&#8217;re looking for without scrolling through chaos.</p>



<p>The keyboard extension on iOS deserves special mention. You can access your entire clipboard history from any app without switching contexts. Combined with the Super Shortcuts feature (which turns any clipboard item into a text expansion trigger), it&#8217;s remarkably efficient once you get it set up.</p>



<p>Quip is available for $19.99 as a one-time purchase for Mac, or $14.99/year for the full ecosystem across Mac, iPhone, and iPad. There&#8217;s a two-week free trial if you want to <a href="https://www.bzgapps.com/quip">see how it fits into your workflow.</a></p>
