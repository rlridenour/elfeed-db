<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 3 licenses ($29.99 value each) for <a href="https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/">Bike</a>. That&rsquo;s right, another chance at Bike! Bike is a deceptively simple outliner. It uses plain text files (HTML, but also supports OPML and text) to store structured data that maintain simplicity while offering a ton of functionality. Add row types like headings, ordered lists, task lists, and more. Create deep-links into your outline (works great with Hookmark).</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bike&rsquo;s nimble. Use it as the main app for a big project or as a supporting app for notes and ideas. Standard file formats, shortcuts support, and scripting allow Bike to integrate with your existing workflows.</p>
</blockquote>
