<p>Here’s a remarkable short film of the great jazz guitarist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt</a>, violinist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Grappelli">Stéphane Grappelli</a> and their band the Quintette du Hot Club de France performing on a movie set in 1938. The film was hastily organized by the band’s British agent Lew Grade as a way to introduce the band’s unique style of guitar- and violin-based jazz to the British public before their first UK tour. As Michael Dregni writes in <a href="http://amzn.to/15i6jBH"><em>Gypsy Jazz: In Search of Django Reinhardt and the Soul of Gypsy Swing</em></a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Quintette was unknown to the British public, and there was no telling how their new music would resonate. So, Grade sought to educate his audience. He hired a movie crew to film a six-minute-plus promotional short entitled </em>Jazz “Hot”<em> to be shown in British theaters providing a lesson in jazz appreciation to warm up the crowds.</em></p>
<p>That would explain the didactic tone of the first two and a half minutes of the film, which plods along as a remedial lesson on the nature of jazz. It opens with an orchestra giving a note-for-note performance of Handel’s “Largo,” from the opera <em>Xerxes, </em>which the narrator then contrasts to the freedom of jazz improvisation.</p>

<p>But the film really comes alive when Django arrives on the screen and launches into a jazz arrangement of the popular French song “J’attendrai.” (The name means “I will wait,” and it’s a reworking of a 1933 Italian song, “Tornerai” or “You Will Return,” by Dino Olivieri and Nino Rastelli.) Although the sequences of Reinhardt and the band performing were obviously synchronized to a previously recorded track, <em>Jazz “Hot”</em> is the best surviving visual document of the legendary guitarist’s two-fingered fretting technique, which he developed after losing the use of most of his left hand in a fire.
