<p id="p4">In a press release to Business Wire, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251210926628/en/Adobe-Makes-Creativity-Accessible-for-Everyone-with-Adobe-Photoshop-Adobe-Express-and-Adobe-Acrobat-in-ChatGPT" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe explains</a> that its three apps can be used by ChatGPT users to:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5">
<ul><li><strong>Easily edit and uplevel images with Adobe Photoshop:</strong>&nbsp;Adjust a specific part of an image, fine tune image settings like brightness, contrast and exposure, and apply creative effects like Glitch and Glow &ndash; all while preserving the quality of the image.</li>
<li><strong>Create and personalize designs with Adobe Express:</strong>&nbsp;Browse Adobe Express&rsquo; extensive library of professional designs to find the best one for any moment, fill in the text, replace images, animate designs and iterate on edits &ndash; all directly inside the chat and without needing to switch to another app &ndash; to create standout content for any occasion.</li>
<li><strong>Transform and organize documents with Adobe Acrobat:</strong>&nbsp;Edit PDFs directly in the chat, extract text or tables, organize and merge multiple files, compress files and convert them to PDF while keeping formatting and quality intact. Acrobat for ChatGPT also enables people to easily redact sensitive details.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p id="p7">This strikes me as a savvy move by Adobe. Allowing users to request image and PDF edits and design documents with natural language prompts makes its tools more approachable. That could attract new users who later move to an Adobe subscription to get more control over their creations and Adobe&rsquo;s other offerings.</p>
<p id="p8">From OpenAI&rsquo;s standpoint, this is clearly a response to the consumer-facing Gemini features that Google has begun releasing, which include new image and video generation tools and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-sam-altman-google-code-red-c3a312ad" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly caused Sam Altman to declare a &ldquo;code red&rdquo;</a> inside the company. I understand the OpenAI freakout. Google has a huge user base and has been doing consumer products far longer than OpenAI, but I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve been very impressed with Gemini 3. Perhaps that&rsquo;s simply because I don&rsquo;t care for generative images and video, but these latest moves by Google and OpenAI make it clear that they see them as foundational to consumer-facing AI tools.</p>
