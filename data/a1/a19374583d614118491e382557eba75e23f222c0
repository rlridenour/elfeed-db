<p><a href="https://plainorg.com">Plain Org</a> v1.2.1 is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002">App Store</a>. The update receives minor features, bug fixes, and improvements.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of <a href="https://plainorg.com">Plain Org</a>, it gives you access to <a href="https://orgmode.org">org</a> files on iPhone while away from your beloved <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>.</p>
<p>I love org markup, but we (iPhone + org users) are a fairly niche userbase. If you're finding Plain Org useful, <strong>please help support this effort</strong> by getting the word out. Tell your friends, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Plain%20Org%20https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid1578965002%20">tweet</a>, or blog about it.</p>
<p>On to v1.2.1 release notes…</p>
<h2>Render LOGBOOK</h2>
<p>State transitions and LOGBOOK drawers are now recognized and rendered as such.</p>
<p>Either of the following snippets are rendered as togglable LOGBOOK drawers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-org">* TODO Feed the fish
- State &quot;DONE&quot;       from &quot;TODO&quot;       [2022-03-11 Fri 12:23]
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-org">* TODO Feed the cat
:LOGBOOK:
- State &quot;DONE&quot;       from &quot;TODO&quot;       [2022-03-11 Fri 12:23]
:END:
</code></pre>

<h2>Add task to top/bottom</h2>
<p>Up until now, tasks were always appended to the bottom of things. This didn't work so well if you like seeing recent items bubbling up to the top.</p>
<p>This version adds a new setting: <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Add new tasks to</em> &gt; <em>Top/Bottom</em>, giving you the choice.</p>
<p>Note: Top is the new default value, please change this setting if you'd like to keep the previous behaviour.</p>

<h2>Checking for changes</h2>
<p>Local file changes aren't always detected via <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/1619945-statechangednotification">state change notifications</a>, so additional checks are now in place to offer reloading files.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v121-released/reload.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Open inactive files</h2>
<p>After adding new tasks via iOS's share sheet, if the item was added to a file other than the active one, offer to open that instead.</p>
