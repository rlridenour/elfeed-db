<p>Events of late have gotten me to reconsider (again!) my usage of social media, in particular what I give to it. If you follow me on <a href="https://instagram.com/kickingvegas">Instagram</a>, I've routinely posted photos of my goings about town there. Henceforth I’m only posting those moments here on this blog and sharing them on Mastodon (<a href="https://sfba.social/@kickingvegas">@kickingvegas.sfba.social</a>) and Bluesky (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kickingvegas.bsky.social">@kickingvegas.bsky.social</a>). If you follow me on Instagram, I invite you to do likewise on either my Mastodon or Bluesky account. I will be severely curtailing my usage of Meta platforms from now on.</p>
<p>For readers who use RSS, I invite you to subscribe to the <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/feeds/all.atom.xml">main feed of this blog</a>. Readers interested in only certain topics can find <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/tags.html">feeds for specific tags</a> I’ve put on blog posts. Two such feeds are for <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/feeds/tags/photo.atom.xml">Photo</a> (my slice of life photos) and <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/feeds/tags/emacs.atom.xml">Emacs</a> (posts I’ve made about my Emacs journey)</p>
<p>Readers looking for my rationale in doing this are invited to do a deep reading of “<a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/14117/11832">History in the making: Whistleblowers and big tech</a>” by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@histoftech">Mar Hicks</a>. The article captures many of the events that inform my thinking on social media today.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are new to my website, welcome! This website talks a lot about computers but not exclusively so. Hopefully you will find something of interest.</p>
