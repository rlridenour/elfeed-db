Intro I upgraded orgmode recently and added org-contrib to my loading. I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s related or not, but suddenly, when I invoke org-capture on a Gnus message (which used to happen seamlessly, suddenly I am getting the following selection message, asking me whether I want org-mairix-store-gnus-link or the old working default org-gnus-store-link . This is the first time I have ever heard of Mairix, and I can&rsquo;t find any customizations to set to get it to stop asking me.
