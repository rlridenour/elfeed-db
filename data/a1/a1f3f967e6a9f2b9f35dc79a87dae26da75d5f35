Here at the Irreal bunker we&rsquo;re trying to recover from an, um, excess of enthusiasm for our Easter dinner with relatives. My torpor is preventing me from putting together a detailed post so here&rsquo;s a short take on something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to mention.<br />
When I think about reading RSS feeds from within Emacs, the only things that come to mind are Gnus and Elfeed. You all know by now that I&rsquo;m a huge Elfeed fan and can&rsquo;t imagine using anything else.

A couple of weeks ago I can across a <a href="https://codelearn.me/2025/04/09/emacs-newsticker.html">post from Ruslan Bekenev</a> about a third option: Newsticker. The interesting thing about it is that it&rsquo;s builtin. Those of you who like minimal configurations with as few packages as possible may want to check it out. If you think you might be interested, take a look at Bekenev&rsquo;s post. It looks like a very nice application but as I said, I&rsquo;m very happy with Elfeed and have no desire to try anything new.</p>
