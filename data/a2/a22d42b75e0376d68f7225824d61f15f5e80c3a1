<p>TikTok reached a last-minute settlement in a California lawsuit that alleges major social media platforms were designed to addict young users and harm their mental health, avoiding participation in a trial that is set to proceed against Meta and Google’s YouTube. The case, brought by a young California woman, is framed as a landmark product-liability test of whether platform design choices and recommendation systems can create legal responsibility for youth harms, with jury selection scheduled in Los Angeles Superior Court. The settlement also comes amid a wider wave of similar suits, as plaintiffs try to shift the legal focus from user-posted content to the platforms’ own product features.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/iJNr4vAG90Pfq23etsidKUninAAW86Kie1u7BHHJEEBrdKXLzgoRkcD72ExWHMxo0dexR0k7CESGnZkuq4VJxX2IXOcjRJwovkYZzQ4ltM3RCYACGrHZkW6iX3g0J9hcBkfXkdw5LRIoX0FzXEiE1sj5YgjVuvVuy9faeWT8JXXxbM3tqrMoEvgwloQEjUX1UlKC6auzA-dGXhQjWrSluQgPDsK869Lu2NbirTRqOAfXlx-O4VlDDBhyjiHUUZ5javQuInLLdJUuTZN5Kw' alt='The TikTok logo is displayed outside TikTok offices in Culver City, California, in a file photo.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Other settlement: Snap Inc., the parent of Snapchat, settled the same case earlier for an undisclosed amount and was expected to have CEO Evan Spiegel testify before resolving its claims.</li><li>Plaintiff details: The plaintiff is identified in court filings as K.G.M., described as 19 in one report and 20 in another, and she alleges the apps contributed to depression and suicidal thoughts after becoming hooked at a young age.</li><li>Key witnesses: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly expected to take the witness stand as Meta prepares its defense in the trial that continues against it and YouTube.</li><li>Liability shield: A central dispute is whether federal law that broadly shields platforms from liability for user-posted content also protects them when claims target addictive design and product features.</li><li>Broader test: Plaintiffs’ lawyers describe this as the first of several “social media addiction” cases expected to reach trial this year, potentially shaping how courts treat algorithm-driven engagement claims.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Plaintiff’s attorneys: They say TikTok’s settlement does not remove it from other personal-injury cases and that the trial will proceed against Meta and YouTube as scheduled.
