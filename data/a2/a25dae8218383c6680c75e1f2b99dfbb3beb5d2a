Our exclusive 20 percent off code works on most accessories sitewide, including Anker's <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fanker-high-power%3Fref%3Dhomepage_masterBanner_1">"high power" charging accessories</a>. This exclusive discount code does not stack with existing discounts on Anker's website, but it can be used on multiple items in the same cart.<br/>

<br/>
In the lists below, we've collected a few examples of the best products available at a discount with our exclusive promo code, but remember that it works sitewide. It's also worth noting that Anker is hosting a back to school sale, and some of the discounts in that event are steeper than our 20 percent sitewide discount. Be sure to check and compare both discounts in your cart before you place your order to ensure you have the best deal.<br/>
