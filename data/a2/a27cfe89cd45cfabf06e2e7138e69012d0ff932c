<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> can be used for making PlayStation purchases on the PS4 and PS5, Sony <a href="https://x.com/playstation/status/1930663531147301051">confirmed today</a>. The feature has been rolling out to PlayStation 5 users over the course of the last few weeks, but it is now available more widely and also on the PS4.<br/>

The option to use &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; is notable because it is a feature that works when you're making PlayStation Store purchases directly on a PS4 or PS5 from the television interface. To do so, add a game to your cart and then go to checkout.<br/>
<br/>
In the checkout interface, select &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;. From there, the PlayStation will display an Apple payment code (essentially an Apple-designed QR code) that can be scanned with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, with payment confirmed through biometric authentication.<br/>
<br/>
Apple implemented support for this type of payment with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> last year. It also works for purchases on third-party browsers like Chrome and Firefox.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; is available alongside PayPal and traditional debit and credit card payment options on Sony's consoles, and using &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; may be more secure and convenient than entering in a credit or debit card number.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/playstation/">PlayStation</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/playstation-apple-pay-support/">PlayStation Adds Apple Pay Support for PS4 and PS5 Store Purchases</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/playstation-adds-apple-pay-support-for-ps4-and-ps5-store-purchases.2458252/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
