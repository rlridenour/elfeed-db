<p>An analogy occurred to me this evening as I was thinking about programming language design:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choosing good keywords and function names is like picking a good font; the ideas conveyed may be the same, but a change can drastically impact legibility and enjoyment of use.</p></blockquote>
<p>PHP does a spectacular job of providing a <em>bad</em> example. It&rsquo;s like the Comic Sans of programming languages. Now there are <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">many reasons why PHP is not a good language</a>—I&rsquo;d like to investigate this particular aspect of its design here briefly.</p>
<p>There are ~55 <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php">functions in PHP that start with <code>array_</code></a>. Why? Why would you need to call the <code>map</code> operator <code>array_map</code>? Or <code>array_filter</code>, etc. Most other languages just call it <code>map</code> and leave it at that.</p>
<p>You might argue that that is a superficial difference: you are still doing the same thing so the expressive power of PHP is the same as whatever other languages you are comparing it to. I disagree. That extra clutter of the <code>array_</code> prefix <em>should not</em> be there and it&rsquo;s purely clutter.</p>
<p>A bad font changes the tone and the perception of a body of text. Likewise, shoddy selection of keywords and names in a language changes it&rsquo;s tone and feel.</p>
<p>Other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>PHP&rsquo;s <code>function</code> keyword and other similar atrocities</li>
<li>Common Lisp (the length of its function names are a shortcoming)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue fleshing this iut more, but these are my thoughts at the present</p>
