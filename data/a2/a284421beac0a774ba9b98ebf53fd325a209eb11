<p id="p2">It&rsquo;s not often that I come across something that slides so effortlessly into my everyday workflow as <a href="https://amzn.to/3EgrVsD" rel="noopener noreferrer">the MOFT Invisible Stand</a> has. It doesn&rsquo;t use batteries, it takes up negligible space, and it&rsquo;s so light that I never question throwing it in my bag when I leave the house. The stand is barely there until I need it, which is when it really shines.</p>

<p id="p5">I had come across MOFT&rsquo;s products online in the past, but it wasn&rsquo;t until CES that I got my hands on them. The company, known for incorporating elements of origami into its products, has been making unique laptop stands and other accessories &ndash; like an iPhone MagSafe Wallet that doubles as a tripod &ndash; for a while, with a focus on minimizing their environmental impact. It&rsquo;s a product philosophy that appeals to me, which is why I took them up on their offer to try the Invisible Stand.</p>

<p id="p7">When the stand arrived on my doorstep, I was immediately reminded of Steve Jobs&rsquo; famous reveal of the MacBook Air. The stand comes in a slim cardboard envelope, not unlike the one Jobs used to emphasize the Air&rsquo;s thinness. One big difference, though, is how light the MOFT Invisible Stand is. When I first pulled it out of its packaging, I wondered how well it would hold up under the weight of a 14&rdquo; MacBook Pro.</p>
<p id="p8">As it turns out, I had nothing to worry about. I&rsquo;ve been using the stand on and off for about a month, and it&rsquo;s as sturdy today as it was the first time I tried it.</p>

<p id="p11">There are some clever touches that add to the utility of what is a very simple accessory. The first is the way the center support of the stand can fold in or out to prop up your laptop at two different angles. In most situations, I&rsquo;ve found that I prefer the angle that holds the MacBook Pro up higher, but it&rsquo;s nice to have the option of a shallower angle as well.</p>
<p id="p12">The second touch I like is that the surface of the MOFT Invisible Stand is made of a faux vegan leather, creating a surprisingly grippy surface. It&rsquo;s not as though your laptop sticks to the stand, but there&rsquo;s enough friction that it stays put.</p>

<p id="p15">Which brings me to another aspect of the MOFT Invisible Stand that I love: the foot of the wedge that holds up your laptop runs the width of the laptop, making the stand work in your lap. Combined with the grippy surface, this has made the stand perfect for using in bed or on the couch. No matter how much I shift around, my MacBook Pro stays in place and feels stable.</p>
<p id="p16">Best of all, when I&rsquo;m finished with the MOFT Invisible Stand, it folds up flat with two small magnets holding its two halves together. This makes the stand easy to tuck away in a bag, in a drawer, or wherever you have space for something the size and thickness of a manila folder, which is to say, just about anywhere.</p>

<p id="p19">My experience with the MOFT Invisible Stand has been great &ndash; so much so that I plan to give the company&rsquo;s other accessories a look to see where they might fit into my life. If you&rsquo;ve tried other MOFT products and have recommendations for me, let me know. I&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>
