<p>The <a href="https://discord.gg/DhDnCYUqG5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formal(ish) Philosophy</a> Discord server was created by Kiran Lloyd (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) with, he says, &#8220;the goal of fostering philosophical community online&#8221; for people working in formal philosophy in a variety of areas: &#8220;philosophy of science, decision theory, minds and machines, logic, analytic metaphysics, and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>He adds: &#8220;It&#8217;s a place for discussion, networking, and collaboration.&#8221;</p>
