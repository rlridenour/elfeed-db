<p>I recently reviewed the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2024_IC3Report.pdf">FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center 2024 report</a>, which revealed $16.6 billion in reported losses (a 33 percent increase) and over 859,000 complaints last year. The most frequent victims? Our oldest generation.</p>



<p>It wasn’t so long ago that phishing emails were easy to spot: terrible spelling, awkward phrasing, even comically bad graphics. That’s no longer true. Thanks to AI, scammers can now follow up a perfectly crafted email with a synthesized voice call that talks you through every step of the con. If you’re lonely or vulnerable, it’s terrifyingly convincing.</p>



<p>I experienced this firsthand just recently. I received what appeared to be an urgent notice claiming I owed a substantial amount to the IRS. The email was flawless, and the automated voicemail that followed sounded almost human. My gut told me it was a scam, but I still called my accountant—because who isn’t paranoid about the IRS? If these tricks can shake my confidence, imagine how easily they might break through to a less tech-savvy senior.</p>



<p>Be careful out there; the bad guys are getting smarter. Forewarned is forearmed.</p>
