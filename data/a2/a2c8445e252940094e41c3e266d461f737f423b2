Apple experienced the strongest year-over-year growth in global PC shipments during the second quarter of 2025 among the top five vendors, according to new preliminary data released by <a href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53677225&_gl=1*1460ra3*_ga*MTMxOTY3MzQwOC4xNzM0MzU5MDIz*_ga_541ENG1F9X*czE3NTE5OTc5NzIkbzEzNCRnMSR0MTc1MTk5ODAyOCRqNCRsMCRoMA..*_gcl_au*MTkxODQzMjIwLjE3NTAwNzkyODY">IDC</a>, despite flat performance in the United States.<br/>

Apple shipped 6.2 million Macs globally in the second quarter of 2025, marking a 21.4% increase from the 5.1 million units it shipped during the same period last year. This outpaced all other top PC manufacturers. Apple's global market share rose from 8.0% in the second quarter of 2024 to 9.1% in the latest quarter, although it maintained its fourth-place position behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell in terms of total volume.<br/>
<br/>
The broader PC market grew 6.5% year-over-year to 68.4 million units, rebounding for another quarter of positive growth after a period of pandemic-related volatility and supply chain disruptions. Lenovo led the market with 17 million shipments, a 15.2% increase from the year prior, followed by HP with 14.1 million units and Dell with 9.8 million. Dell was the only one of the top five vendors to see a decline, falling 3.0% from the same quarter in 2024.<br/>

IDC attributed much of Apple's growth to strong performance outside the United States, where shipments rose 9% year-over-year. In contrast, the U.S. PC market posted zero percent growth during the quarter. IDC believes that the flat U.S. performance likely reflects inventory buildup and anticipation of upcoming tariff increases. As a result, shipments recorded in the second quarter could reflect efforts by Apple and its retail partners to front-load deliveries to the U.S. before potential cost increases take effect.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's 21.4% shipment growth in the second quarter followed a similarly strong performance in the first quarter 2025, when Mac shipments rose 14.1% year-over-year. That trend stands in contrast to the slower growth reported by other major vendors this year. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/idc/">IDC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/idc-mac-shipments-continue-to-soar/">IDC: Mac Shipments Continue to Soar</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/idc-mac-shipments-continue-to-soar.2461239/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
