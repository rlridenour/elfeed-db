<p>Hey,
just found a command for gdb that prints a string from memory address.</p>
<p>Looks like this <code>x /s &lt;addr&gt;</code>. Very useful if you need to print out the string that is in memory somewhere.</p>
<p>Previously I&rsquo;ve used other flags to print for example hex values but was pretty hard to read.
Glad there is special solution in GDB for this.</p>
