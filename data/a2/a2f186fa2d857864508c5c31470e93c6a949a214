<blockquote>
  <p>ISSEY MIYAKE and Apple today unveiled iPhone Pocket. Inspired by
the concept of “a piece of cloth,” its singular 3D-knitted
construction is designed to fit any iPhone as well as all
pocketable items. [...]</p>

<p>Crafted in Japan, iPhone Pocket features a singular 3D-knitted
construction that is the result of research and development
carried out at ISSEY MIYAKE. The design drew inspiration from the
concept of “a piece of cloth” and reinterpreted the everyday
utility of the brand’s iconic pleated clothing. The development
and design of iPhone Pocket unfolded in close collaboration with
the Apple Design Studio, which provided insight into design and
production throughout.</p>

<p>I don’t object to the price ($150 for the short strap, $230 for the long strap). I do object to Apple going along with <a href="https://us.isseymiyake.com/">Issey Miyake</a>’s preference to style their name in all-caps.</p>

<p>(This, despite the fact that the brand label on the Pockets <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/iphone-pocket-issey-miyake-lowercase.jpeg">is styled in all-lowercase</a>.)</p>
