<li>A brightly colored guitar</li>
<li>Pre-strung</li>
<li>Accessories include: some picks, a strap, a bag, a pick guard, and a hex key</li>
<li>Is it available in Georgia Red: No, somehow we’re selling colorful guitars and we have no red</li>
</ul><h1>Pretty Cool? Or: Pretty, Cool?</h1><p>So, we’re selling guitars now?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We’re selling <em>colorful</em> guitars!</p>
<p>Also, they come with other stuff, too. Like a bag, some picks, a pick guard, a hex key, and a strap. And it’s pre-strung.</p>
<p>In other words, you buy the guitar, we send it to you, you take it out of the box, you give it a quick tune, and you’re ready to shred. Acoustically. No assembly required, unless you count connecting the strap. And that’s only if you want to play standing up.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s the perfect gift for the aspiring guitarist in your life, whether it’s your kid, your partner, your friend, or you yourself.</p>
<p>But, a word to the wise, if you do start to really make some progress, you’ll probably want to trade this thing in for another acoustic guitar. No, not because there’s anything wrong with how it plays. It’s just how it looks.</p>
<p>Think about it: you start writing your own songs and going to open mics with a brightly colored guitar, there’s a risk that it’ll become your brand. And next thing you know, no one’s talking about your music. Instead, everyone’s just obsessed with your colorful instrument, and you’ll be forced to come up with a ridiculous band name or stage persona that speaks to this fact.</p>
<p>You know, something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teal-y Dann</li>
<li>Blue Reed</li>
<li>The Violet Femmes</li>
<li>Red Sheeran</li>
<li>KoЯnflower</li>
<li>Bronze Ferdinand</li>
<li>Puce Springsteen</li>
<li>Clap Your Hands Gray Yeah</li>
<li>Beige Against The Machine</li>
<li>Cyan &amp; Garfunkle</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, be honest with us. These puns are pretty good, aren’t they?</p>
<p>And you know what else is pretty good? These guitars! So get one.</p>
