<p>In his 1957 book <a href="https://archive.org/details/testamentbyfrank0000unse/page/238/mode/2up"><em>A Testament</em></a>, Frank Lloyd Wright described a skyscraper a mile high that he hoped to build in Chicago. Atomic-powered elevators would serve a net rentable area of more than 13 million square feet, with covered parking for 15,000 cars and landing decks for 150 helicopters.</p>
<p>Wright imaged it would be &#8220;more permanent than the pyramids,&#8221; but the plan was never realized. The 528-story building would have been nearly twice as tall as the Burj Khalifa and four times the height of the Empire State Building.</p>
