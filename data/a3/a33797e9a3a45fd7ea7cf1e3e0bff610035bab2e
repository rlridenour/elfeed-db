Lars Ingebrigtsen has an <a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2025/03/16/wherein-i-explain-why-emacs-is-the-best-tool-for-wordpress/">interesting post</a> on his <a href="https://github.com/larsmagne/ewp">EWP</a> his package for publishing blog posts to WordPress. I&rsquo;m a long term <a href="https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog">Org2blog</a> user and really like it but, sadly, my host provider, that I&rsquo;ve been with for many years, no longer supports the necessary protocol.
</p>
<p>
I was, therefore, interested in Ingebrigtsen&rsquo;s package. But as far as I can see, it doesn&rsquo;t support Org mode which is a deal breaker for me. I write everything in Org and have no interest in learning another system. Ingebrigtsen says that the problem with most WordPress publishing apps is that they don&rsquo;t make it easy to do things like add links, embed videos, and other such matters.

But, of course, Org makes all that easy. I write my blog posts in normal Org mode, convert them to HTML, and paste them into my WordPress portal. It&rsquo;s not quite as seamless as Org2blog but it&rsquo;s not too bad. Still, I&rsquo;d love a system where I could just write in Org and press a button and post to WordPress like I used to be able to do with Org2blog.

If you&rsquo;re not an Org devotee and want to use WordPress, take a look at Ingebrigtsen&rsquo;s post. It may be just what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
