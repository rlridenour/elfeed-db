<p>Iran has imposed a near-total internet shutdown during nationwide protests, with rights groups reporting hundreds killed and thousands detained amid an ongoing crackdown. Several residents and monitors say a limited number of people have still managed to get online via SpaceX’s Starlink satellite service, which Iran bans, offering a narrow channel to communicate and share information with the outside world. Australia’s ABC reports Iran is using “military-grade” jamming aimed at disrupting Starlink signals as the blackout stretches into a fifth day.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/yEaCP9mobyEFZrqAyK-lRPQEjgBD1cWPYzGoS8fHmC7c2TNtRZAD0w0589eH-o08oWt7yZW8PVDYPuQ0_M57wMRedIL3c8we0oguHTKly0gOTDnLthchd19YIs3YQeoD-exvdGgr_vxST7NLMOXBBIfat5rSrAO_rAM14Sa72bbDlFO6PWstjI_ldQONqhyODHxH9-qwJrWNKVhXXOn7vXxNhtOoiI90wr9p9GI4UV3g2Jdqxb4lXigsagQp2WVPH69MmG41IvoYgfZwtw' alt='Iranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Tehran on January 9, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Smuggled connections: The Guardian describes an informal network of smuggled devices and improvised setups that some Iranians use to send photos, videos and messages out of the country despite the blackout.</li><li>Monitoring signal: NetBlocks founder Alp Toker said he heard Starlink still works in some areas, though access appears reduced, suggesting uneven connectivity across locations.</li><li>Sharing evidence: The Telegram channel Vahid Online posted images and video from places including Kahrizak and funeral gatherings, illustrating how small pockets of connectivity can still carry protest information outward.</li><li>How shutdown works: Reuters-sourced reports note Iran’s regular internet relies on fibre-optic cables and mobile towers, which authorities can restrict, while satellite links can bypass those choke points.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iranian authorities: Authorities have moved to sharply restrict communications during the protests, including shutting down internet access and, according to ABC, using jamming intended to disrupt Starlink connections.
