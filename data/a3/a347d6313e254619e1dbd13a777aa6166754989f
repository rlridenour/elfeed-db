<p>Everyone needs a place to write down both the big and little things that come up during the day. The medium (paper or digital) matters less than the ease with which notes can be recorded and recalled.</p>
<p>Today I’m writing about digital scratchpads, and the value of integrating a life dashboard where you’ll see it every single day. I’m coming from the perspective of keeping daily notes in <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025-04-14-obtf-start-here">One Big Text File</a>, but the principles apply to any daily note practice.</p>
<h3 id="it-doesnt-matter-if-you-prepend-or-append-notes-unless">It doesn’t matter if you prepend or append notes, unless…</h3>
<p>Whether or not you use one file per day or one per year (as I do), you will have to choose whether notes made throughout the day go above or below the note before. Multiple notes in a single daily notes file can have a time stamp if you want to track the chronology of thoughts throughout the day.</p>
<p>Entries are always dated and optionally time stamped (in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format, e.g.&nbsp;2025-04-14 14:06, because we are <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/073-obsessively-date-format-opinionated">civilised</a> <span class="small-caps">😉</span>) and may be added to the top or bottom of the document. (Okay, okay, I concede that the format of date and time stamps within a document that’s appropriately dated don’t <em>really</em> matter.) Either approach—appending or prepending—is fine as long as you’re consistent.</p>
<p>I’m a little jealous of the way Roy Lowrance (a <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl"><span class="small-caps">PTPL</span></a> reader) prepends text to his <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I start each day with a to-do list for the day. It goes at the top of the file.</p>
<p>Notes written that day are just behind the to-do list.</p>
<p>If a new&nbsp;note closely relates to an existing note written today, I write the new note after the existing note. Otherwise, I write the new note after the to-do list.</p>
<p>My one-big-text-file is a file in Obsidian.</p>
<p>—Roy Lowrance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading that, my fingers itched to do the same! The approach has an elegant simplicity I admire. If there was a way to auto re-order entries I’d likely switch from top down to bottom up multiple times a month just for the variety (<span class="small-caps">FYI</span> there kind of is a way to do this; see below).</p>
<p><a href="https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/" target="_blank">Jeff Huang</a>, <a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/the-append-and-review-note/" target="_blank">Karpathy</a> and others add notes to the bottom of their <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025-04-14-obtf-start-here"><span class="small-caps">OBTF</span></a>, and so do I. It’s not the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>right” way to do it, but it does have advantages. Appending adds the useful friction of seeing the top of the file first every time you open the file, something you can leverage into a dashboard for focus items.</p>
<p>The <span class="small-caps">⌘↓</span> and <span class="small-caps">⌘↑</span> keyboard shortcuts quickly take you from the beginning to the end of the text in most Mac apps. This allows easy access to the chosen focus points <em>and</em> the business end of your notes.</p>
<h3 id="crafting-your-dashboard">Crafting your dashboard</h3>
<p>It’s my firm opinion that everyone needs a dashboard in one form or another. My dashboard is a master plan of what’s on my plate laid out in an easily digestible and accessible format. Add anything you need to access more than once a week. The Hookmark utility can help you generate links to files anywhere on your Mac. You can use basic <a href="https://hookproductivity.com" target="_blank">Hookmark</a> features for free. It’s also available on <a href="https://setapp.sjv.io/c/4183813/344537/5114" target="_blank">Setapp</a> — highly recommended — for a 30-day free trial (use the code <span class="small-caps">ELLANE</span>).</p>
<p>The dashboard at the top of my <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span> is nothing more than a Markdown formatted list of things I want to see daily:</p>
<ul>
<li>This year’s theme words (mine are <em>Listen · Learn · Simplify · Serve</em>)</li>
<li>Inspirational quote (changed up every now and then)</li>
<li>Links to active project pages</li>
<li>Weekly focus areas (based on <a href="https://www.carlpullein.com/blog/introducing-the-weekly-planning-matrix/22/2/2023" target="_blank">Carl Pullein’s matrix</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If your daily notes are in an <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span>, your dashboard will sit at the top of the file, greeting you every time you open it. Should you create a new file per day for daily notes, I recommend placing a link to wherever your dashboard lives at the top of your daily notes template.</p>
<p>Apps like Obsidian or iA Writer can transclude (embed) your dashboard at the top of your notes.</p>
<h3 id="a-spreadsheet-as-a-notes-app-well-i-never"><span class="small-caps">💡</span> A spreadsheet as a notes app? Well I never!</h3>
<p>One of the <a href="http://www.matthewcornell.org/blog/2005/8/21/my-big-arse-text-file-a-poor-mans-wikiblogpim.html#:~:text=I%20have%20been%20using%20a%20single%20Excel%20worksheet%20as%20a%20PIM%20at%20work%20for%20over%20one%20year%2C%20and%20I%20don%27t%20think%20that%20I%20could%20function%20without%20it" target="_blank">comments</a> on Matthew Cornell’s article on big text files talks about using a spreadsheet for taking notes.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Each item, thought, next action, waiting, general reference, etc is entered on one line,” says Tom.</p>
<p>Spreadsheets are free, sortable, exportable, and available on any device. They’re not plain text, but that would be a mere export away.</p>
