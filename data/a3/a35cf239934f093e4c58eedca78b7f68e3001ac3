<p>South Africa ordered Israel’s top diplomat in the country, charge d’affaires Ariel Seidman, to leave within 72 hours, saying a “series of unacceptable violations of diplomatic norms” challenged South Africa’s sovereignty. Pretoria cited, among other issues, insulting posts made via official Israeli social media accounts about President Cyril Ramaphosa and what it called a deliberate failure to notify South Africa about visits by Israeli officials. Israel responded with a reciprocal move, declaring South Africa’s diplomatic representative in Israel, Shaun Byneveldt, persona non grata and ordering him to leave within 72 hours. The diplomatic clash lands on top of already strained relations after South Africa brought a case to the UN’s top court in 2023 arguing that Israel’s war in Gaza amounts to genocide—an allegation Israel rejects—making this a sharp escalation in an already tense bilateral relationship.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/mhUI309B5HLbRArSGamwIkdPwcmlaz-A_2fbfAjZzlFFTo3tcNjEWy8A2hCC55Br3MjvVgLPKZwAfcDw_tkn-M1190-pfV3eSdPJRkAqRHaZ' alt='A protester holds a poster depicting President Donald Trump and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a solidarity protest in Cape Town, South Africa, on Jan. 22, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ambassador recalled: Seidman had been Israel’s most senior representative in South Africa since Israel recalled its ambassador in 2023, underscoring how limited the relationship already was before this latest step.</li><li>Israel’s rebuttal: Israel’s foreign ministry called the expulsion of Seidman “a unilateral, baseless step” and accused South Africa of “false attacks against Israel in the international arena”.</li><li>Social media row: South African officials pointed to a November post from the Israeli embassy saying, “A rare moment of wisdom and diplomatic clarity from President Ramaphosa,” which they viewed as part of a pattern of insulting official messaging.</li><li>G20 backdrop: The embassy post referenced reporting about Ramaphosa’s comments that “boycott politics doesn’t work,” made in the context of President Donald Trump’s decision not to attend the G20 summit in Johannesburg.</li></ul><blockquote>This decisive measure follows a series of unacceptable violations of diplomatic norms and practice which pose a direct challenge to South Africa’s sovereignty - South African foreign ministry (statement)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>South African government: Pretoria says the expulsion responds to repeated breaches of diplomatic norms, including insulting official social media posts about President Cyril Ramaphosa and failures to properly notify it about visits by Israeli officials.
