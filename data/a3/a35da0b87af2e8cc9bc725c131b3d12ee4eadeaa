<p>Norwegian authorities have opened a corruption investigation into senior diplomat Mona Juul and her husband, Terje Rød-Larsen, after renewed scrutiny of their past contacts with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Juul has resigned from her post as Norway’s ambassador to Jordan and Iraq, and Norway’s foreign ministry confirmed her departure as the probe unfolds. Police say they suspect Juul of gross (aggravated) corruption and Rød-Larsen of complicity, with Norway’s financial-crime unit Økokrim leading the case. Norwegian and international media have also reported that Epstein left $10 million in his will to the couple’s children, intensifying questions about the relationship and whether it could have intersected with public duties. Reuters said the probe is part of a widening scandal in Norway and elsewhere in Europe over prominent figures’ ties to Epstein.</p><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Peace diplomacy past: Juul and Rød-Larsen are internationally known for their roles around the Oslo Accords era, with Rød-Larsen described as having played a vital part in the process.</li><li>Focus of suspicion: Økokrim says it suspects Juul of gross corruption tied to her work at Norway’s ministry of foreign affairs, centering the case on alleged conduct while she was in government service.</li><li>Resignation timing: The foreign ministry announced Juul’s resignation on Feb. 8 in the evening, days after it suspended her from her ambassador role.</li><li>Broader trust debate: NDTV described the Epstein-linked revelations as a wider crisis of confidence in Norway, saying the affair has reached other prominent figures beyond Juul and Rød-Larsen.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Norwegian police (Økokrim): Police say they suspect Mona Juul of gross (aggravated) corruption and Terje Rød-Larsen of complicity, and that Norway’s financial-crime authorities are handling the investigation.
