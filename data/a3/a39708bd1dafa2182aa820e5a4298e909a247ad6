Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup was the clear driver of smartphone growth during China's "Singles Day" shopping festival, according to new industry data.<br/>

Apple was the top-selling smartphone brand throughout this year's month-long Singles Day period in China, accounting for 26% of all smartphone sales, according to a new report from Counterpoint Research shared by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apple-single-handedly-drives-singles-day-smartphone-sales-growth-2025-11-27/"><em>Reuters</em></a>. Overall smartphone sales rose just 3% year-over-year, and Counterpoint says the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> alone prevented the market from seeing what would otherwise have been a 5% annual decline.<br/>
<br/>
Counterpoint's data indicates that demand for &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models was particularly strong throughout the festival, which ended on November 11. The rebound continues a trend seen over recent months, during which Apple has steadily outpaced the wider Chinese smartphone market after years of cooling demand.<br/>
<br/>
Data provider Syntun told <em>Reuters</em> that total Singles Day sales across all major e-commerce platforms reached 1.70 trillion yuan (&#36;240 billion), up from 1.44 trillion yuan last year, which had a shorter promotional window. In its most recent earnings call, Apple said it anticipated what could be its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/30/apple-december-quarter-projection/">strongest December quarter on record</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Huawei recorded the steepest decline among major brands, with its share dropping to 13% from 17% a year ago. Its new flagship Mate 80 launched too late to participate meaningfully in the festival. Xiaomi held the second-largest share with 17%, though its sales also declined year-over-year due to the earlier release timing of the Xiaomi 17 series.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/">Counterpoint</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/28/iphone-17-drives-smartphone-growth-in-china/">iPhone 17 Lineup Drives Smartphone Growth in China</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-lineup-drives-smartphone-growth-in-china.2472268/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
