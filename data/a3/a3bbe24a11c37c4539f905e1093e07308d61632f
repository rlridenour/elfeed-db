<p>One of my rules for myself: &#8220;Don&#8217;t let assholes turn you into an asshole.&#8221;<span id="more-53779"></span></p>
<p>Why? Well, I don&#8217;t want to be an asshole, and I certainly don&#8217;t want to cede power over my actions to assholes.</p>
<p>This rule isn&#8217;t always easy to follow. Like anyone else, I can feel provoked by the words and actions of others. Insults, obnoxiousness, offense, condescension, callousness, cruelty, ignorance, idiocy, and various combinations thereof can raise my hackles. Sometimes I fail at following this rule. And since one doesn&#8217;t always know how one comes off, I probably fail more than I realize. Still, I think it&#8217;s a good rule, and&#8212;keeping in mind the previous sentence&#8212;I think I&#8217;m pretty good at abiding by it.</p>
<p>If I am any good at abiding by it, one reason is that I have a lot of practice trying to do so. That&#8217;s just part of running an online space and putting one&#8217;s words in front of a lot of people. Your ego develops some callouses. You realize you can&#8217;t respond to everything&#8212;there&#8217;s no time&#8212;so you just respond on a subset of the occasions in which responding would be worthwhile. And when you do respond, you think about whether what you say is likely to produce bad behavior by your interlocutors or others that you&#8217;ll have to deal with in some way, and whether that&#8217;s worth it.</p>

<p>Anyone online at least a moderate amount of time runs the risk of coming across offensive or foolish commentary, be it directed at them personally or about someone or something they care or know about. Protected from retaliation by distance and sometimes by pseudonym, people are more prone to bad communication behavior, subject to more of it themselves, and feel fewer constraints against responding in kind. Sometimes the &#8220;don&#8217;t let assholes turn you into an asshole&#8221; rule may apply and would be helpful, but sometimes it may be inapt or too vague.</p>
<p>So I thought I&#8217;d share with you the advice of psychologist <a href="https://www.drdelprado.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia del Prado</a>, who has a <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/how-to-respond-to-offensive-comments-in-a-thoughtful-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent essay</a> up at <em>Psyche </em>about how to respond to offensive comments. I urge you to go and read the whole thing (and to <a href="https://psyche.co/donate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donate</a> to Aeon Media, which publishes a lot of public philosophy at <em>Aeon </em>and <em>Psyche</em>, while you&#8217;re there). But I&#8217;ll pull out three pieces of advice she provides.</p>
<p>The first is &#8220;check in with yourself,&#8221; and ask yourself whether the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It is very important to speak up about this.</em></li>
<li><em>I am up for the risks involved in speaking up.</em></li>
<li><em>I have enough energy to speak up.</em></li>
<li><em>I will regret it if I don’t say something.</em></li>
<li><em>Speaking up will be empowering for me.</em></li>
<li><em>I’m open to the possibility that it might not turn out how I hope.</em></li>
<li><em>I can handle it if this person is not receptive to my words.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Another is to &#8220;consider what your goal is.&#8221; Doing so will help you focus what you say, and stating your goal will help others better understand you. She shares some examples, just so people understand the kind of thing she&#8217;s referring to by &#8220;goal&#8221; (it&#8217;s not meant as an exhaustive or universal list):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I want to stand up for myself.</em></li>
<li><em>I want to share a different perspective.</em></li>
<li><em>I want to support someone I care about.</em></li>
<li><em>I want to stand up for a marginalised group.</em></li>
<li><em>I want to challenge injustices I witness.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It sounds basic, but I see lots of online commentary in which it does not seem like the authors have asked themselves what their goals are.</p>
<p>A third piece of advice from del Prado is &#8220;anchor yourself in your values.&#8221; This involves reflecting on what your values are, and crafting your communication in light of the most important relevant ones.</p>
<p>del Prado elaborates on each of these in <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/how-to-respond-to-offensive-comments-in-a-thoughtful-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her essay</a>, and offers some other advice as well. One concerns calming down and getting in the right mindset, and reminded me of something that has been at the top of the <a href="https://dailynous.com/comments-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments policy</a> here at Daily Nous from its start eleven years ago. If it has been a while, or if you&#8217;ve never looked at it, please do so.</p>

<p>As usual, discussion is welcome, and particularly welcome is advice on participating in online discussions.</p>
<p>I should add that I know what popped to the forefront of many a reader&#8217;s mind just now is: &#8220;Advice? Don&#8217;t read the comments.&#8221;</p>
<p>I get that. And I laugh at some of the humorous complaints I see on social media about the comments at Daily Nous. Here&#8217;s a recent good one:</p>

<p>Still, I think having a place for us all to discuss issues of common concern is worthwhile, and if we can figure out improved ways to do that, great.</p>
<p>Avoidance is always an option, but better is to be the comments section you want to see in the world.</p>
