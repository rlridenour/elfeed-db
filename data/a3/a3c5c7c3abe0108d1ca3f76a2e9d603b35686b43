The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> could start with 256GB of storage as part of a &#36;50 price increase across the lineup this year, a Weibo leaker has suggested.<br/>

In a new post, the leaker known as "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Instant Digital</a>" reiterated rumors that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup will be announced on Tuesday, September 9 with a &#36;50 price hike across the board, and pondered whether the increase could come hand-in-hand with a storage bump.<br/>
<br/>
Today, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, 16 Plus, and 16 Pro start with 128GB of storage, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max starts with 256GB of storage. The four models are priced starting at &#36;799, &#36;899, &#36;999, and &#36;1,199, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
In July, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/30/iphone-17-price-increase-expected/">Jefferies said</a> that Apple will implement a &#36;50 price increase across the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup to offset rising component costs and China tariffs. This means the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, 17 Air, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max will likely be priced at &#36;849, &#36;949, &#36;1,049, and &#36;1,249, if the company's positioning and pricing trends continue.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible that Apple could increase the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;'s base storage to 256GB, bringing it in line with the Pro Max, to help justify its &#36;50 price increase. That would represent an effective price cut of &#36;50 over today's &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; with 256GB of storage and help to simplify the lineup.<br/>

Likewise, <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> reported in May that Apple was considering <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-considering-price-increases-iphone-17/">raising prices</a> for its upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models. The company reportedly aims to pair the potential price hikes with new features and design changes to justify the increased cost to consumers, rather than attributing them to tariffs.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/will-iphone-17-pro-start-at-256gb-storage/">Will iPhone 17 Pro Start at 256GB Storage?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-iphone-17-pro-start-at-256gb-storage.2462875/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
