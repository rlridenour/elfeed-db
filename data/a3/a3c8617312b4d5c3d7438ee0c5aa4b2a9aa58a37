<p>At the 1910 World’s Exhibition in Brussels, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Hupfeld">Ludwig Hupfeld</a> unveiled the Phonoliszt-Violina, an instrument once dubbed “the eighth wonder of the world.” A leading maker of automated instruments in Germany, Hupfeld built a company that produced everything from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5nrbnkoMcN/">phonola push-up players</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_piano">player pianos</a>. In 1907 he created his most famous invention, the Phonoliszt-Violina. It featured three vertically mounted violins, each with a single active string, played by a rotating bow of 1,300 horsehairs. Meanwhile, pneumatic bellows pressed the strings according to perforated rolls. And a player piano could accompany the violins. Sold in upright home and commercial models, the Phonoliszt-Violina entertained patrons of upscale hotels, restaurants, and cafes, before gradually fading into obsolescence. The Wintergatan video above, along with the WelteMax video below, will give you a nice introduction to one of the most complex music players ever made.</p>
