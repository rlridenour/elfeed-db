<p>A couple of people wrote back to me regarding my <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/06/01/i-wish-i-could-use.html">last post</a> about the challenges I have with Journelly (which, again, don&rsquo;t really have anything to do with the app itself, but my workflow).</p>
<p>In an Email, HTH let me know that while Syncthing is not officially supported on iOS, there is an app that works and does the job just fine: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/synctrain/id6553985316">SyncTrain</a>. I tested it, and it successfully synced my files to my iPhone, iCloud not included. That&rsquo;s an amazing find.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was thinking about how I can better streamline my process of refiling Journelly&rsquo;s entries to my journal, where they are&hellip; archived. Duh! I can simply use org-mode to archive entries into my journal file. All I need to do is define the file I want them to archive into in the file options at the start of the file. Journelly even has an archive feature built in, but since I want to save my entries off the phone, it won&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>However, I realized I might not want to send my Journelly entries away. Journelly is convenient, and I use it constantly for notes. Having these available on my iPhone (where Journelly has an excellent search feature with tags) <em>and</em> on Emacs on the Mac at the same time is a boon to my productivity, not to mention, it just looks so <em>nice</em> on the phone.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m considering a different mental approach. Instead of refiling and moving entries away from Journelly, I&rsquo;m going to try and expand on what I have there later. Some of this I already discussed before: things like meeting entries, for example, can be copied later to my dedicated meeting file, and activities can be copied to my event file, if I feel there&rsquo;s more to add. The missing piece is expanding on &ldquo;mind dumps&rdquo; in Journelly that go into tangents. For that, I want to break the ideas into specific subjects with Denote later. For example, if I write an entry in the morning about Journelly and I&rsquo;m realizing I&rsquo;m rambling about the app and have ideas, I can later put these ideas into a &ldquo;Journelly thoughts&rdquo; note later with Denote, along with the appropriate keywords and attachments, as needed. This, I think, also covers the concern I have regarding privacy and iCloud, as the Journelly entry will just cover the initial nugget, where I will write some key points which I will later develop in a dedicated note off Apple&rsquo;s servers.</p>
<p>This is all pretty new and raw in my head, so I&rsquo;m going to try that out for the rest of the week and see how I feel.</p>
