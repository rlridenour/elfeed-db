Joe Marshall has a nice post on <a href="https://funcall.blogspot.com/2025/09/lisp-still-matters.html">Why Lisp Still Matters</a>. He observes that Lisp tends to attract the very best programmers but the reason for that and the reason for Lisp&rsquo;s enduring success is its extensibility. As Marshall says, the thing about Lisp is that it&rsquo;s based on the Lambda calculus, which means, among other things, that the language can be extended in terms of itself. In practical terms, that means that you can use macros to define new syntax and provide the semantics of that new syntax with some functions.

All of this is fairly well known and Marshall has a good exposition of the argument in his post. As I was reading it, it popped into my mind that it&rsquo;s the same with Emacs. It&rsquo;s not—just—a matter of Emacs being written in Lisp. The similarity is based on their extensibility. Like Lisp, if you need some new Emacs functionality it&rsquo;s easy to build it yourself using the language the Emacs itself is written in. As with any Lisp, you can even extend Emacs&rsquo; Lisp language if you need to.

A lot of Emacs&rsquo; extensibility is, of course, enabled by it&rsquo;s being written in Elisp. That fact should give pause to all those who are always agitating for Emacs to be rewritten in Java, Javascript, Python, Ruby, or whatever. I doubt every much that we&rsquo;d have the same level of extensibility if that were to happen.</p>
