<p>It feels strange that I always receive a lot of marketing emails despite the fact that I never subscribed to any.</p>
<p>I even feel like I have control over it because of that tiny &ldquo;Unsubscribe&rdquo; link that is always available.<br>
I locate it in less than a second, click it and bye bye little annoying email - you&rsquo;re done. I can even detect the tricks from these unsubscribe tools
when they unsubscribe me and then show me the big green button saying <strong>Confirm and <em>subscribe</em> again</strong> which is supposed to trick me.<br>
But I&rsquo;m untrickable! Haha!</p>
<p>I just did the same to &ldquo;LA GRANDE ABBUFFATA PIZZA+PASTA PARTY&rdquo; (whatever that is) email but now I feel tricked on another level.<br>
I&rsquo;m just part of this strange process where businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>subscribe me to their marketing material</li>
<li><a href="https://www.acma.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-05/Fact%20sheet%20-%20email%20and%20SMS%20unsubscribe%20rules.pdf">government tells them to make sure people can unsubscribe</a></li>
<li>businesses comply</li>
<li>I receive marketing emails</li>
<li>I unsubscribe</li>
<li>the circle repeats</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like everybody gets what they want here except me.</p>
<p>How much value was produced in this circle? Probably some, right? Right?<br>
Maybe somebody has a job and can support their family because of it. I really hope so.<br>
I can slightly suffer for this reason.</p>
<p>I do appreciate the trick&hellip;</p>
