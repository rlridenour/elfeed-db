Over at the Emacs subreddit, floofcode complains that he doesn&rsquo;t like the way visual-line-mode handles moving from line to line. He found that everything worked fine without visual-line-mode so he wondered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1qij4or/when_is_visuallinemode_useful/">when is visual-line-mode useful</a>.

If you read his post, you&rsquo;ll notice that he had visual-line-mode turned on globally. That explains a lot of his frustration. As nice as visual-line-mode can be, you definitely don&rsquo;t want it enabled all the time. It would be a disaster when writing code, for example.

The thing about visual-line-mode is that it considers all the text between line feeds to be one long line and soft wraps the text to fit your screen size.That&rsquo;s useful even when you&rsquo;re just dealing with text locally but I find it essential for my blogging. If I set a hard line size, it gets carried onto my blog and really messes up the displays of people with smaller screens or windows such as those reading Irreal on a phone. With visual-line-mode, the text gets flowed to fit the target screen.

So the answer to floofcode&rsquo;s question is that visual-line-mode is definitely useful but mostly when you&rsquo;re writing prose such as in Org-mode. I use it whenever I&rsquo;m writing prose but never when I&rsquo;m, say, programming or using some other specialized Emacs mode. For instance, I don&rsquo;t use it in my Org based tax files because they&rsquo;re mostly tables and don&rsquo;t include long sequence of text. I generally set it on a per file basis except for my blog where a hook recognizes blog posts and sets it and some other appropriate modes.</p>
