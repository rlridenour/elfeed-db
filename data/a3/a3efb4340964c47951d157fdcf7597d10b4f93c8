Last week, we listed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/10/airpods-pro-3-features/">eight new AirPods Pro 3 features</a>, including a U2 chip in the charging case. The addition of the U2 chip has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1ng3822/airpods_pro_3_have_the_u2_chip_in_the_case_now/">receiving a lot of attention</a> since then, so we wanted to single out its inclusion and discuss it in more detail.<br/>

Until now, Apple only referred to the U2 chip as a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, but it is <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/compare/">no longer shying away</a> from using a name that might remind Apple fans of the free U2 album that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/14/u2-apologizes-for-auto-downloads/">infamously added to everyone's iTunes account</a> in 2014.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip debuted a few years ago, in all iPhone 15 models and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. The chip enables a location-tracking range of up to 200 feet/60 meters, which is up to 3× longer range compared to Apple's first-generation U1 chip in the AirPods Pro 2 charging case, AirTag, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Accordingly, the main benefit of the U2 chip in the AirPods Pro 3 case is up to 3× longer range compared to the U1 chip in the AirPods Pro 2 case, so you can locate the case with the Find My app's Precision Finding feature at longer distances, in the unfortunate event that you lose or misplace your AirPods Pro 3 somewhere around you.<br/>

The long-rumored AirTag 2 is also expected to be equipped with the U2 chip.<br/>
