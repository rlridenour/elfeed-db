Apple is expected to launch its first foldable iPhone next year, and while there have been plenty of rumors about the book-style foldable's design and cameras, there are still questions surrounding its potential battery life, particularly given Apple's recent focus on thinness.<br/>
<br/>

According to the leaker and news aggregator account "<a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=224077504572&navType=by">yeux1122</a>" on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, Apple is testing a battery in the 5,400–5,800 mAh range, which would make it the largest capacity of any current or previous iPhone. For reference, the iPhone 17 Pro Max has a 5,088 mAh battery.<br/>
<br/>
As for how it would compare to rival foldables already on the market, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold has a battery size of 5,015 mAh, while the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has a 4,400 mAh battery, so anything in Apple's alleged testing range would likely offer superior battery life.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/foldable-iphone-impressive-battery-life-thinness/">March report</a> from the same Korean aggregator account claimed that Apple has placed a heavy focus on improving power efficiency while slimming down key components of its foldable iPhone, with battery life said to be a key priority for the company. Separately, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said the device will use <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">high-density battery cells</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The latest post claims that Apple will eventually settle on a capacity at the higher end of its testing range, as it apparently did previously with the iPhone Air. The details allegedly originate from a supply chain source, and the blog has offered accurate insights into Apple's component strategy in the past, but it has also been wrong, so a degree of caution is warranted.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple sources agree on key specifications for Apple's first foldable iPhone, including a 7.8-inch main display when unfolded and a 5.5-inch cover display. That's the consensus among <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">Kuo</a> and fellow analyst Jeff Pu, as well as the Weibo leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/">Digital Chat Station</a>. The device is also expected to use Touch ID integrated into the side button instead of Face ID, similar to the iPad Air and iPad mini.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's first foldable iPhone is expected to be equipped with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/foldable-iphone-rumored-features/">four cameras</a>, consisting of one front camera, one inner (possibly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/">under-screen</a>) camera, and two rear cameras. The device will reportedly use Apple's second-generation C2 modem for cellular connectivity, but it will lack a physical SIM card slot.<br/>
<br/>
Barring any unexpected delays, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman believes the foldable iPhone will launch alongside the iPhone 18 Pro models in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-24/apple-to-launch-iphone-17-pro-iphone-17-air-in-september-iphone-fold-next-year-mepmzpcj">fall of 2026</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/">Naver</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/18/apple-foldable-biggest-iphone-battery/">Apple&#039;s First Foldable Could Have Biggest Ever iPhone Battery</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-foldable-could-have-biggest-ever-iphone-battery.2471415/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
