I was trying to make sure that hl-line mode (to highlight a line) is not on in my dired buffers without changing its presence anywhere else, since it messes up display of my diredfl permission faces. Unfortunately, the following didn&rsquo;t work, probably because &ldquo;setting&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the same thing as calling the variable. What was the best way to selectively disable hl-line-mode? There were many good answers on Reddit1.
(add-hook &#39;dired-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local global-hl-line-mode nil hl-line-mode nil) ;; I wasn&#39;t sure on the relationship between ;; these two, or even which one was being used )) Learning along the way: global- is unrelated to hl-line-mode It turns out that global-hl-line does not share anything in common with hl-line-mode other than the end result, so altering one does not alter the other.
