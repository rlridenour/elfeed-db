</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
In which Sir Weydlyn continues his trek towards the castle, learning of a fate perhaps worse than death.
</p>
        <p>The eastern golden dapple sky frames the two horses, a large stallion with
horned helm and a smaller rouncey.  On the stallion rides a broad shouldered man
bedecked gambeson and dark polished scale, one hand holding the reins, the other
a raised bolt-guisarme, and empty saddle bags.  The rouncey, riderless, bears a
clutch of javelins, heavy saddle bags, and bedroll.</p>
<p>Ahead the overgrown plains begin rolling into hills that look as though shunned
by the spring rains.  Riding on, the waves of tall grasses fall behind the three
as they ride amidst the dry hills (coordinates <code>8,2</code>), where morning sun has now
drifted to mid-day.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>
I make a Barrier Check…encountering none.  And then a Wilderness Roll…Encounter
the Hex’s <strong>Landmark</strong> otherwise all clear.
</small></p>
<p><small>
And here we come to another procedure that I will need to establish.
</small></p>

</section>

<h1 id="establishing-a-landmark-procedure">Establishing a Landmark Procedure</h1>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

Some Wilderness Hexes contain a Landmark.  These are discovered when travellers
roll 4-6 on the Wilderness roll. A typical Realm has 3 or 4 of each type of
Landmark.  Mark them with their initial or an icon.

<footer>&mdash;<cite>Mythic Bastlionland</cite>
page 14

</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>This prompts me to wonder: can a Landmark and Myth be in the same Hex?  So I
read about Myth Hex (emphasis mine).</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

Place 6 Myths (p27) in remote places.  Number them as 1–6.  The Hexes are
<em>clearly affected</em> by the presence of their Myth.

<footer>&mdash;<cite>Mythic Bastionland</cite>
page 14

</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>While not explicit, I’m going to assume that Landmarks and Myths will not share
a Hex.  Also, I need to consider that a Myth might be in a Hex and showing some
signs.  This will require a bit of logic as a knight travels across the realm.</p>
<p>We need to know if the Hex has Landmark or alterations due to a Myth.  There are
6 Myths.  There are 6 types of Landmarks: Dwellings, Sanctums, Monuments,
Hazards, Curses, and Ruins.  So we’d have between 18 and 24 Landmarks.  I’ll
also assume that Myths do not exist in Holdings.</p>
<p>As I set about doing this, I realized, why don’t I encode the map into an Emacs
data structure then interrogate that data structure.  Which proved to be a fun
little diversion worthy of its own blog post; the long and short being I now
have a few functions I can call to query the map to ask for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a barrier between Hex one and Hex two?</li>
<li>Is there Myth on this square?</li>
<li>What is the nearest myth?</li>
<li>What is a random myth that is not the nearest?</li>
<li>What is direction to a given myth?</li>
</ul>
<p>One side-effect is that I had to change the coordinate system.  Namely I’m
starting the top-most left-most hex at <code>0,0</code>; immediately down is <code>0,1</code>, then down
and right is <code>1,0</code>.  I could make more significant adjustments, but for now that’s
what I’ll be working from.</p>
<p>With my map loaded, I ask it “What, if any feature is on <code>8,2</code>?”  And I get
“Monument 4“.  I pull a Random Myth to find the Monument and get “Sky Spire.”
Now, will Weydlyn tarry and explore this Sky Spire?  I think not.  He seeks to
fulfill his <em>Promise</em> to Tompot.</p>
<h1 id="amidst-the-hills">Amidst the Hills</h1>
<p>Weydlyn rides southwest, making for the castle and <em>Seat of Power</em>.  As the
mid-day clouds make way, he sees a multi-coloured spire shimmering in the east.
In his heart, he feels a desire to look upon the spire, to turn Ingot towards
the scintillating spire.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>I rolled a few sparks: Multi-colour, shimmering, and desire.</small></p>
</section>

<p>But his <em>Promise</em> to Tompot burns as a bright brand in the grim night of his soul.
This spire of light and enchantment tugs and pulls at him.  As though all his
forge work was but slag, and only now has he beheld true beauty.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>
Here, I find myself wishing for the Virtues of Pendragon.  Yet I, as the
referee, am not quite wanting to compel Sir Weydlyn.  So, let’s <i class="dfn">Ask the Stars</i> if
I as the referee should compel Sir Weydlyn?  The answer is “No but…” so as
referee, I don’t call for the compulsion.
</small></p>
<p><small>
Because I’m playing both sides of the table, should remove the option at this
moment.
</small></p>

</section>

<p>The tower pulses for a moment, Weydlyn hears an angelic song break out, and the
tower vanishes.  Heavy clouds roll in and with it the song fades.  Sir Weydlyn,
not wishing to chase phantoms, continues his journey towards the castle.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>
Making to exit <code>8,2</code> into <code>7,2</code>, I check for a <i class="dfn">Barrier</i>.  And there is none.  I make
the <i class="dfn">Wilderness Roll</i> and “Encounter the next Omen from the nearest Myth.”  I
wonder, what is the nearest myth to <code>7,2</code>?  I get “myth 1”.  Which is neither the
Mountain nor the Beast.  I roll up a random Realm myth and get “The Judge.”
</small></p>
<p><small>
This is my first encounter with the Judge, and the Omen reads as follows: “A
wretch pleads for charity.  She was a Knight, sentenced harshly by the Judge.”
</small></p>
<p><small>
First, I need to know, is the Judge on this Hex?  No.
</small></p>
<p><small>
I roll a land character spark to determine the lay of these new hill: overgrown.
</small></p>

<h1 id="of-wretch-and-judgment">Of Wretch and Judgment</h1>
<p>With noon day now waning, Sir Weydlyn, Ingot, and the other horse, find
themselves in the overgrown hills a days travel northeast of the castle.  They
make their way along the narrow trails of taken by the infrequent peddlers
trekking between tower and castle.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> We’re going to name these, but only upon arrival.  Then I might go back and
update my posts.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>Ahead on the trail Weydlyn notes a downtrodden wretch, sitting beside the trail.
She is rubbing her feet.  And seeing Weydlyn, she lowers her head.  Weydlyn
slows and stops a few paces from the woman with tangled hair adorned in rags.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>
Here I need to read a bit about the Judge.  Are these Judgments fair?  It seems
as though the judgments are arbitrary, perhaps stinking of the fey.  Which helps
me understand how next to proceed.
</small></p>
<p><small>
I pull a random Knight/Seer to get a theme for the judgment: Sharpness.  Another question
</small></p>

</section>

<p>“Good Knight, might you spare a bit of charity for a fellow downtrodden Knight?”
begs the wretch.</p>
<p>Sir Weydlyn now looks to see if there is truth in these words.  Uncertain he
responds, “A Knight?  I daresay you look not the part.”</p>
<p>The woman bows her head, “No, I have lost that part, as the Judge, Ambrageft, of
Diamond Eye has seen fit to judge me guilty and cast me to the road-side, poor
and beggard.”</p>
<p>Steadying Ingot and drawing him back a step, Weydlyn asks the wretch, “If knight
you were, tell me true of your deeds.”</p>
<p>The wretch, tells of her knighting and fetching the vassal rod from the red
vultures and restoring it to Lord Prentise, ruler of the realm.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>I used several different pages to assemble these narrative points.  I also
rolled the wretch up as the Violet Knight.</small></p>
</section>

<p>Listening, a few questions begin filling Weydlyn’s mind.  And as she finishes
her tail, he begins with his questions, “And it was not Lord Prentise whom
judged you but this Amrageft?  How can this be?”</p>
<p>“Yes, not Lord Prentise, but Amrageft terrible and hard.  And how it came to be?
A courier handed me a lambskin scroll and written in crimson in language unknown
was the decree.  A season later, I was whisked away to a court, and judgment
cast,” replied the woman.</p>
<p>“And were you guilty?” asks Weydlyn.</p>
<p>“I had upheld my Oaths.  And the charges, why they were most absurd.  I was
found guilty of under-sharpening<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>

</small>
 my grand mace,” responds the wretch now rising,
“and after the season long trial they just this day returned me here.  This Myth
found me unworthy.”</p>
<p>Weydlyn, now seeing the woman stand, looks her over.  And the word “Myth”
settles amongst the din of steel always clanging in his head.  “These times are
strange.  And my heart wishes to know the truth of…”</p>
<p>“They are true, I…,” she interrupts</p>
<p>Sir Weydlyn hisses, “Silence.  Your words, I wish I could know their truth.
Ride with me to Lord Prentise’s castle.  And there he can vouch for you and your
tale.  And know that if you have treated me false and now lead me astray, you’ll
feel the bite of steal.  I ask of you two things: your name and to give this
horse a name; his previous owner failed to tell me before he died.”</p>
<p>“I speak true and thank you for your kindness.  I am Beatrice.  And I shall call
this lovely steed Light’s Return,” says Beatrice.</p>
<p>Sir Weydlyn’s scornful eyes look past Beatrice, as though searching for a mirror
to see check if this fear in his heart shows on his brow.  Fear of what he could
become if this tale of hers is true.  Now looking on her, he hopes she proves
false.  He tightens his grip on his bolt-guisarme, aching to toss it into her
lying mouth.</p>
<p>He guides Ingot beside Light’s Return and grabs the javelin bundle then tosses
the reins to Beatrice, and with a cold steely voice says, “We will ride a few
more hours then camp for the night.”</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>
I roll up Beatrice’s stats as though a Knight Errant:
</small></p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><small>Guard</small></dt><dd><small>1</small></dd>
<dt><small>Clarity</small></dt><dd><small>14</small></dd>
<dt><small>Spirit</small></dt><dd><small>5</small></dd>
<dt><small>Vigor</small></dt><dd><small>13</small></dd>
</dl>
<p><small>
I’m envisioning that Beatrice might be a squire?  Or swear an oath anew.
Perhaps returning to her seer.

<h1 id="reflections">Reflections</h1>
<p>As mentioned, I started playing this session, prepared to manage the game state
in a document and infer what must be where based on rolls.  But then I thought
how absurd, why not encode a map and then write functions to query the map.
That was an enjoyable side-quest, and as mentioned is something I’ll later blog
about.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this session, Weydlyn has directly encountered two myths
and has it on authority the general location of another.  Also, having
reconciled past statements, I have a sense of where three Myths are.  My
algorithm for finding the closest myth, in the case of ties, is to randomly pick
from those that share the closest distance.</p>
<p>And as I write this, I realize that I want a consistent answer from a given hex.
So I’m going to set about providing a consistent answer.  That could mean my
present map configuration is not correct given the new algorithm; but I have
ways to rebuild the map in such a way as to be truthful to what has emerged in
play.</p>
<p>For now, before I set about a minor code change, I’m doodling a bit on the map,
I know that the Judge must be within 3 hexes of <code>7,2</code>.  Otherwise the logic would
invalidate the in game facts regarding the Mountain and the Beast.</p>
