<p>President Trump says the United States is sending a “massive” fleet of warships toward the Gulf region “just in case,” while also saying he would prefer to avoid conflict and remains open to talks with Iran. The deployment comes amid heightened tension tied to Iran’s nuclear program and the Iranian government’s crackdown on recent protests, with activists reporting thousands killed and a prolonged internet blackout limiting information from inside the country. Iranian Revolutionary Guards commanders, meanwhile, warned that their forces have a “finger on the trigger,” underscoring how quickly rhetoric could harden even as diplomacy is still being discussed.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8uKN6-R35NFCw6DdJtT6EmbGKhs9jtvj3xAKOs3L9mQvDqiJW9aMXkAymZ5MdNcMskAr3YS5ljxk_ux0eYqFh4VSn-nQAqtWZu3d1Rhw7zUQeslbKGUTefMKuRpoQYqrf1eG8cy6lo5SpFZZR7A-zBZUObPHkVYg4M4JfnqZce7r19Q_ejZw_AlPep-QmiVgfqEZAhPQjjrOVlLtGC8Z0XX9aD8flTG3tesF6_tCVrj7Cx7oYEQgvDxEDQ' alt='President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on January 22, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Forces named: US officials said the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers are expected to arrive in the Middle East in the coming days, and the US is also looking at deploying additional air-defence systems.</li><li>Red lines: President Trump renewed warnings to Tehran not to restart its nuclear programme and not to kill protesters or carry out mass executions, framing the naval move as added pressure and deterrence.</li><li>Protest toll: The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said at least 5,002 people have been killed and more than 26,800 detained in the crackdown, including 43 children, while Iran’s government reported 3,117 deaths and described some of those killed as “terrorists”.</li><li>Internet blackout: Activists and rights groups say Iran’s authorities imposed what they describe as the most comprehensive internet blackout in the country’s history, complicating independent verification and the flow of information.</li><li>Recent war context: Dawn reported that Washington had backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war in June aimed at degrading Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, a recent backdrop to today’s escalatory language.</li></ul><blockquote>I’d rather not see anything happen but we’re watching them very closely. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US President Donald Trump: He described the deployment as a precautionary move, said he would prefer nothing happen, and said he is open to talks because he believes Iran “does want to talk”.
