<p>Brief update on the blog: I had been running a custom fork of the <a href="https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole">Anatole</a> theme; it diverged pretty heavily, and I found a nice way to customize the CSS. Behold! The new-and-improved blog.</p>
<p>Some of the new extensions to Anatole include the ability to set a static page as your profile; I&rsquo;ll do this and include links to lists of publications and whatnot. This should make my blog a better place for my professional/academic life.</p>
<p>I have lost my comments and metrics plugins; I&rsquo;m debating about whether or not I will want to re-include them. I wasn&rsquo;t getting too much benefit from them (though it was exciting to see when a post I wrote made it to the front page of HN!) and they&rsquo;re a little bit of a hassle to maintain.</p>
<p>In other news, I&rsquo;m trying out <a href="https://sr.ht/~ashton314">SourceHut</a> to host some of my projects; stay tuned for a post about μKanren, a tiny logic language that can be embedded into pretty much any language you want. You can read the material that will form the source of my post <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~ashton314/microKanren">here on SourceHut</a> if you are impatient.</p>
