<p class="wp-block-paragraph">DevSecOps is one of the most important shifts in modern systems.<br>It is not DevOps with security added later.<br>It is security designed into the CI/CD pipeline before the first commit.</p>



<span id="more-8716"></span>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For small businesses, this matters more than ever.<br>Deadlines are tight. Systems are under load. Stress is constant.<br>When a cloud-hosted Git platform or CI/CD service goes down, productivity stops.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Resilient teams think differently.<br>They keep control over their tooling.<br>They design redundancy early.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This is where lightweight, self-hosted solutions fit naturally into a pragmatic DevSecOps strategy.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">DevSecOps is not a job title.<br>It is a senior security-focused mindset.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gitea &#8211; The Lightweight Git Solution</h3>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There are many on-premise and cloud Git platforms available.<br>They run. They scale.<br>And they eat resources.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://about.gitea.com/products/gitea/">Gitea</a>&nbsp;is an open source Git server.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It&#8217;s:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Self-hosted.</li>



<li>MIT licensed.</li>



<li>Lightweight.</li>



<li>Fast.</li>
</ul>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As a secondary system, or right away&nbsp;<strong>as primary</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; the solution is enterprise grade.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A Git framework with role-based access control.<br>Protected repositories.<br>Merge requests.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Gitea Actions &#8211; The Heart Of DevSecOps</h3>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A&nbsp;<strong>reliable</strong>&nbsp;source code platform requires more than storage.<br>It needs fast, predictable CI/CD.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://docs.gitea.com/usage/actions/overview">Gitea Actions</a>&nbsp;is included. Ready.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The mindset matters more than the toolset.<br>But the right tool helps shape the right mindset.</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">You do not work around artificial limitations.<br>You do not depend on legacy plugins.<br>You do not compromise on security.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">You adapt the tool to your processes, not the other way around.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h3>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">You do not need a data center full of racks to achieve reliability.<br>You do not need dozens of cloud instances to build resilience.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A lightweight, Go-based and open source platform is often enough.</p>



<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As a primary system, it delivers.<br>As a secondary or backup system, it protects.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">DevSecOps is not about tools.<br>It&#8217;s about deliberate design.</p>
