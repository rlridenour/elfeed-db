<p>&#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221; was the only observation<br />
That escaped Lieutenant-Colonel Mary Jane,<br />
When she tumbled off the platform in the station,<br />
And was cut in little pieces by the train.<br />
Mary Jane, the train is through yer:<br />
Hallelujah, Hallelujah!<br />
We will gather up the fragments that remain.</p>
<p>&#8212; A.E. Housman</p>
