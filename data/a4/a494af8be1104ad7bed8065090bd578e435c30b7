<p id="p1">I always enjoy iFixit&rsquo;s teardowns of new Apple hardware. I&rsquo;m not the sort of person who&rsquo;s interested in taking my own devices apart; I&rsquo;m just not that handy. However, I do like to see how Apple&rsquo;s gadgets are assembled, and the iPhone Air is the most fascinating teardown in a while.</p>

<p id="p3">As Apple noted in its fall keynote, the guts of the Air surround the camera housing at the top of the phone. The rest is mostly battery. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/113171/iphone-air-teardown" rel="noopener noreferrer">As iFixit explains it</a>, the Air:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  &hellip;packs the upgraded C1X modem, a new N1 WiFi chip, and the A19 Pro system-on-chip, all tucked into the logic board sandwich. It&rsquo;s a lean, efficient setup that makes the most of limited space. This reduced complexity also contributes to quicker disassembly&mdash;fewer features, fewer parts,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;fewer points of failure.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">That design makes the Air more repairable than you might expect for such a thin phone. In particular, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/113171/iphone-air-teardown" rel="noopener noreferrer">iFixit was impressed</a> with how easy it was to remove and replace the battery:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote6"><p>
  The Air&rsquo;s battery is easy to find&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;accessible through the back glass thanks to Apple&rsquo;s dual entry design. Even better, it&rsquo;s a metal-encased battery. This thin layer of armor makes it more bend resistant and safer to replace. Even better than&nbsp;<em>that</em>, it&rsquo;s mounted with electrically debonding adhesive strips. Hook them up to a power source and the battery lifts right out, no dangerous prying required.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p7">iFixit&rsquo;s post and accompanying video also look at the new chips inside the iPhone Air and put the 3D-printed titanium USB-C port housing under a microscope. It&rsquo;s impressive hardware design and manufacturing that also makes Apple&rsquo;s thinnest phone one of its most repairable yet.</p>
