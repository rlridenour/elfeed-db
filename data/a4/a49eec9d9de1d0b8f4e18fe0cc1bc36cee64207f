Scrapy provides a few <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/exporters.html">item exporters</a> by default to export items in
commonly used file formats like CSV/JSON/XML. I usually use CSV to
export items, it is pretty convenient, and it comes in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>appending mode, for example, <code>scrapy crawl foo -o test.csv</code></li>
<li>overwriting mode with <code class="verbatim">-O</code> option, like <code>scrapy crawl foo -O test.csv</code></li>
</ul>
<p>But in the appending mode, it&#39;s a bit annoying that it always appends
the header row before the newly scraped items, which is not correctly
in terms of CSV format.</p>
