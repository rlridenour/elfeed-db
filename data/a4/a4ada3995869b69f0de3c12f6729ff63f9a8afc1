<p>I have just released FSet 2!&nbsp; You can get it from&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/fset/fset/-/releases/v2.0.0">common-lisp.net</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/slburson/fset/releases/tag/v2.0.0">GitHub</a>.&nbsp; A detailed description can be found via those links, but briefly, it makes the CHAMP implementations the default for sets and maps, and makes some minor changes to the API.</p><p>I am already working on 2.1, which will have some performance improvements for seqs.</p><p><br /></p>
