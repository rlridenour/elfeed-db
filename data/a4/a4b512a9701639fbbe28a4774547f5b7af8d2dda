<p>Mark Gurman and Shirin Ghaffary, reporting yesterday for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Billionaire philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs is an io backer as
well, through her firm the Emerson Collective. Other investors
include Sutter Hill Ventures, Thrive Capital, Maverick Ventures
and SV Angel. Altman doesn’t have equity in io, OpenAI said. [...]</p>

<p>When he left Apple six years ago, Ive started the firm LoveFrom, a
collective of designers and engineers. The staff includes veterans
of Apple’s hardware and software departments, as well as friends
of Ive and other collaborators.</p>

<p>He then co-founded io last year with Apple alumni Scott Cannon,
Evans Hankey and Tang Tan. Hankey was Ive’s successor at Apple and
remained at the company until 2023, while Tan led iPhone and Apple
Watch product design until 2024. Cannon worked at Apple before
co-creating the once-popular email app Mailbox, which was acquired
by Dropbox Inc. [...]</p>

<p>LoveFrom has a number of former Apple designers who helped create
the look of the Mac and iPhone operating systems, including Bas
Ording, Mike Matas and Chris Wilson, Ive said. They could help
redesign OpenAI’s app for a new generation of consumers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I struggle to imagine what they even <em>could</em> be making, but that’s one hell of a lineup of talented ex-Apple folks. I know a few other people who’ve joined io too, and they’re A-teamers.</p>
