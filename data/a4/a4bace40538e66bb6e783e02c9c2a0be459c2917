<p>In order to comply with Senate Bill 1 of the Ohio Legislature (SB1), the <a href="https://www.utoledo.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Toledo</a> will no longer be allowing students to become philosophy majors.<span id="more-53565"></span></p>

<p>The philosophy major is one of nine degree programs the university <a href="https://news.utoledo.edu/index.php/04_21_2025/utoledo-updates-academic-portfolio-through-prioritization-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> it is ending because of SB1. The others are Africana Studies, Asian Studies, Data Analytics, Disability Studies, Middle East Studies, Religious Studies, Spanish, and Women&#8217;s and Gender Studies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a> orders the state&#8217;s public institutions of higher education to &#8220;eliminate any undergraduate degree program it offers if the institution confers an average of fewer than five degrees in that program annually over any three-year period.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also prohibits &#8220;the continuation of existing diversity, equity, and inclusion offices or departments&#8221; or the establishment of new ones.</p>
<p>It requires each public institution of higher education to &#8220;affirm and declare&#8221; that it &#8220;shall ensure the fullest degree of intellectual diversity,&#8221; (though this and related clauses in this section of the legislation &#8220;do not apply to the exercise of professional judgment about how to accomplish intellectual diversity within an academic discipline, unless that exercise is misused to constrict intellectual diversity&#8221; and &#8220;nothing in this section prohibits faculty or students from classroom instruction, discussion, or debate, so long as faculty members allow students to express intellectual diversity&#8221;).</p>
<p>SB1 also includes clauses about limiting the right of public employees to strike, and about their collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p>The legislation is facing some popular <a href="https://cwcolumbus.com/news/local/ohio-educators-teachers-education-submit-thousands-signatures-hope-repeal-controversial-education-bill-youngstown-ag-attorney-general-dave-yost-petition-sb1-advanced-higher-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushback</a>, and there is currently a petition calling for a referendum on it that registered voters in Ohio may sign. Signatures for the petition, which must be collected in person, not online, are being submitted to the state attorney general in waves. The first wave of 1,000 signatures was submitted on April 21st. Information about the petition and where it can be signed is <a href="https://ohsb1petition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am told that it is SB1&#8217;s clause about graduation rates, and not those about DEI, that triggered the decision to end the philosophy major. It&#8217;s worth noting then, that the clause about graduation rates includes the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The chancellor may grant a waiver to a state institution for a program to which this division applies. State institutions shall appeal for a waiver in a form and manner determined by the chancellor. If the chancellor grants a waiver to a state institution, the chancellor shall establish terms under which the state institution may conditionally continue the program, including whether the program is eligible to be supported by state share of instruction funds.</em></p>
<p>So there may be a way to save the philosophy major at the University of Toledo, and <a href="https://www.utoledo.edu/al/philosophy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the department</a> is looking into possible avenues for that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also told that, fortunately, the elimination of the major is not anticipated to lead to cuts to the philosophy faculty, owing to the Philosophy Department being responsible for many high-enrollment courses satisfying general education requirements while also offering required or recommended courses for other programs (Logic, Medical Ethics, Data Ethics, Environmental Ethics, and others).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it has been reported that the sponsor of the SB1, Jerry C. Cirino, wants to follow Trump&#8217;s lead in coercing universities with threats to their funding. <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/education/2025-04-17/ohio-state-senator-jerry-cirino-defends-higher-education-bill-in-cleveland-talk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ideastream Public Media reports</a> that Cirino, chair of the Senate finance committee, &#8220;said the committee will attempt to tie higher education funding to compliance with SB1, to ensure &#8216;all the work we’ve done doesn’t go to waste.'&#8221;</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/22/new-ohio-law-ends-philosophy-major-at-univ-of-toledo/">New Ohio Law Ends Philosophy Major at Univ. of Toledo</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
