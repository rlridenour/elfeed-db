<p>Hamas says it will dissolve its governing administration in the Gaza Strip once an “independent” Palestinian technocratic leadership committee takes over the territory, a step described as part of a U.S.-brokered truce framework. Several outlets describe the planned replacement body as a non-partisan, technocratic committee, but report that no names have been announced and no clear handover date has been provided. The plan is linked in reporting to a U.S. initiative described as President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace,” which is portrayed as overseeing key elements of the arrangement. While many details remain unresolved, the stated intent to move toward a technocratic administration signals a possible opening for new governance arrangements in Gaza if the handover materializes.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/aLT1m4pBWhc5riFPSwABbDAv4hs3lpK4RXt2IZU9PAuh-tjuYizRQ8ufcdstuHukKdExY2ujOziIoRaJAU2CCKRRmoMoBN8AtfezEGbocUaiM0I36_xwqbY-SVYwvmLwyaTbogDMRIcR0dBgv2YBm64fF0eNSd--YxPxrm1HgnKV75ZJnGhA9ECLAYF8Gy-Xr4FLPTjyG2lLrvz6UpfOP6qEp0i3pE8RL8w' alt='View from Gaza amid continued uncertainty over governance arrangements' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Agency preparations: Hamas says it has instructed its Gaza government agencies to get ready to cede authority to the incoming independent technocratic committee.</li><li>Unannounced lineup: Reporting says neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority has released the names of the technocrats expected to run the new committee.</li><li>Oversight elements: Euronews reports the broader framework includes supervision of steps such as disarming Hamas and deploying an international security force under President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace”.</li><li>Rival authority role: The Palestinian Authority is described as the Palestinians’ internationally recognised representative and a key counterpart to Hamas in discussions about Gaza’s future administration.</li><li>Timing unclear: Across reports, Hamas provides no specific timeline for when the dissolution of its Gaza government would take effect.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Hamas: It will dissolve its Gaza government and hand over authority once an independent technocratic committee takes over, but it has not given a specific date.
