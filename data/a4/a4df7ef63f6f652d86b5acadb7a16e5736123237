<p>Andy Allen, of <a href="https://notbor.ing/">Not Boring Software</a>, last week on Threads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the focus on the App Store injunction has been mostly on the
commission rate, what’s been overlooked is just how far the tools
of the App Store have fallen behind.</p>

<p>There’s a long and growing list of features common on most payment
and subscription service providers that still aren’t possible on
the App Store today. Price testing, refunds, managing
subscriptions, plan migrations, gifting, discount codes,
subscription bundles — to name just a few. Entire businesses have
spawned just to fill these critical gaps. [...]</p>

<p>Apple has always been one to embrace competition. It’s a
battlefield where they’ve historically done very well. They’ve
never been afraid to step into a crowded market with their intense
focus on design and user experience to show us how insanely great
something can be when you truly care.</p>

<p>More than anything, I hope this moment reignites that
competitive spirit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s kind of bananas that it’s 2025 and the App Store still doesn’t allow developers to issue refunds. I’ve had this discussion with numerous developers. They’ll be doing customer support, and <em>want</em> to issue a refund, but explain that they can’t — and users find that so hard to believe they suspect the developer is bullshitting them. But you really do have to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223">request a refund from Apple</a>, not from the developer directly, and step 2 of the process is “Wait 24 to 48 hours for an update on your request”.</p>
