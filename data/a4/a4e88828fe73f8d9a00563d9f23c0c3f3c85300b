<p>Floods across southern Thailand have killed at least 33 people in nine provinces after days of intense monsoon rain, with more than 2.5 million residents affected and tens of thousands stranded or displaced in hard‑hit areas such as the city of Hat Yai. Authorities say waters have begun to recede in parts of the region, revealing widespread damage to homes, roads and farmland and the grim discovery of additional bodies, even as search and rescue operations continue. The Thai government has deployed helicopters, boats and military units to airlift hospital patients, deliver oxygen tanks and food, and evacuate people trapped in submerged neighborhoods. While conditions slowly improve in some Thai districts, northern Malaysia remains under threat, with thousands already relocated to relief centers as the same weather system brings heavy rain further south.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/isj734w8sRXxr7usTIzZX1Q393ipJRkhhe52ai5_G2p8pWM5HJPmZkERy8DUSlC8h5413S4oxPY8lUxNv6VwciUz7OfAT3_noaqoEx8p6z21li3PIjmpMwqPKvM8CDTczfHk3qQ0BIeT52jY7lGFnGhKwas7xA_H2k5z9RPmlGqJ5Dq1qaESkL-F' alt='Rescue workers and residents navigate floodwaters in southern Thailand’s Hat Yai as helicopters and boats bring aid to the submerged city.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of flooding: Southern Thailand’s flooding has inundated entire urban areas such as Hat Yai for around five days, cutting road access and submerging buildings above ground level in some neighborhoods.</li><li>Emergency air operations: Thai authorities used military aircraft to transfer critical hospital patients and fly in supplies like oxygen cylinders and medicine to the isolated Hat Yai hospital complex surrounded by floodwaters.</li><li>Agricultural losses: Officials and local media report extensive damage to rice paddies, rubber plantations and other farmland in the southernmost provinces, raising concerns about longer‑term livelihoods for rural communities once waters recede.</li><li>Displacement in Malaysia: Northern Malaysian states have moved several thousand residents into temporary shelters as rivers swelled and low‑lying villages flooded, with authorities preparing sandbags and evacuation plans in case rainfall intensifies.</li><li>Climate context: Meteorologists and regional officials link the severe downpours to a stronger‑than‑usual northeast monsoon interacting with warmer seas, part of a broader pattern of heavier seasonal flooding seen in Southeast Asia in recent years.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Thai government and emergency services: Officials stress that rescuers are prioritising evacuations of stranded residents and medical airlifts in Hat Yai while also beginning damage assessments and cleanup where waters have dropped, saying more support will follow once immediate safety is secured.
