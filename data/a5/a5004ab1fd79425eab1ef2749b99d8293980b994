<p>Modern dashboards look impressive. Yet, when systems fail, we return to the shell.<br>The basics &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>ps, grep, awk, ip, nmcli, sed, uniq, sort</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; never left.</p>



<p>They are still the quickest path between question and answer.</p>



<p>This post is not nostalgia. It&#8217;s about precision, control, and speed.<br>The old tools survive because they do exactly what we ask.</p>

<p>The UNIX philosophy is still alive: one task &#8211; one tool.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="orge8d9787">Observation over Decoration</h3>



<p>Every shiny monitoring tool uses the same data you can reach in one command.</p>



<p><em>Example: memory issues.</em></p>



<p>Instead of checking a web dashboard, run:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ps aux --sort=-%mem | head
</pre>



<p>You see who&#8217;s eating memory, no delay, no abstraction.<br>The system talks directly to you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org50699e2">Patterns and Filters</h3>



<p><code>grep</code>,&nbsp;<code>awk</code>, and&nbsp;<code>sed</code>&nbsp;are lenses.<br>They turn noise into information.</p>



<p>Imagine a full log file of SSH connections:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | awk '{print $(NF-3)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
</pre>



<p>This one line answers:&nbsp;<strong>who is attacking me the most right now?</strong><br>No Python, no web UI, just structure and logic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org9ab4a42">Seeing the Network</h3>



<p><code>ip</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>nmcli</code>&nbsp;replaced the old&nbsp;<code>ifconfig</code>.<br>They are fast and scriptable.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ip -brief addr show
nmcli device status
</pre>



<p>These two tell you the truth about network state &#8211; up, down, misconfigured, or missing routes.<br>You learn what&#8217;s&nbsp;<strong>really happening</strong>&nbsp;without leaving the terminal.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org477abe7">Sorting Signal from Noise</h3>



<p>The trio&nbsp;<code>sort</code>,&nbsp;<code>uniq</code>, and&nbsp;<code>awk</code>&nbsp;is often enough for full reports.</p>



<p><em>Example: count of processes by user:</em></p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ps -eo user= | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
</pre>



<p>You can build daily summaries, audit reports, or troubleshooting scripts with just these commands.<br>No dependencies. No waiting.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org05d4797">When Fancy Tools Fail</h3>



<p>When your web dashboard breaks or Prometheus stops collecting, the basics still run.<br>They are installed by default. They don&#8217;t need a service, a container, or a browser.<br>They only need your logic and a working shell.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="org3436c33">Field Note</h3>



<p>Simplicity wins under pressure.<br>The shell is the most honest interface in computing.</p>



<p>When you master the core tools, you no longer depend on layers built on top of them.<br>That independence is what makes a real system administrator.</p>
