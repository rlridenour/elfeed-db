 
          <p>Hi again autumn, how have you been? Not well? Well me neither but I&rsquo;ve been told that&rsquo;s part of life and we&rsquo;ve got to accept it and move on. Last month I ran a feature on card games on this blog, producing <a href="/tags/card-games/">nine lovely articles</a> ranging from Flemish trick taking traditions to card game mini games and how to properly play patience&mdash;both old and new. I don&rsquo;t know about you but I thoroughly enjoyed myself writing these and might do something similar again in the future.</p>
<p>As for the solutions to the last <a href="/post/2025/09/name-those-card-games-quiz-three/">Name Those Card Games Quiz</a>, here you go:</p>

<p>Previous month: <a href="/post/2025/09/august-2025">August 2025</a>.</p>
<h2 id="books-ive-read">Books I&rsquo;ve read</h2>
<p>Still almost nothing. I&rsquo;m struggling to steal a few minutes of time here and there to do so. The intentions are there: I bought six books last month. So far, these efforts resulted in finishing a few chapters in Sebastiaan Chabot&rsquo;s <em>Olifantenpaadjes</em>: a weird Dutch novel about a divorced family reliving their happy memories during summer holidays in France. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been translated yet and I can&rsquo;t yet judge whether it should be. Next month, perhaps.</p>
<h2 id="games-ive-played">Games I&rsquo;ve played</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/games/">the codex logbook</a>: as part of the card game feature I dove into Sierra On-Line&rsquo;s rich <em>Hoyle Card Games</em> history and tried my hand (ha!) at a few handheld card games but couldn&rsquo;t quite find anything that matches my favourite version: the 2002 PC edition. <em>Clubhouse Games</em> proved to be all right but cumbersome, <em>18 Classic Card Games</em> remarkably includes Klaverjassen but its execution is below sub-par, <em>Ultimate Card Games</em> is all right for a change, which cannot be said for the 2000 <em>Hoyle Card Games</em> Game Boy Color version.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m finished with digital trick taking for now. CodeWeavers finally allows me to play PC-only games on my MacBook and <em>Wizordum</em> runs wonderfully on it so far. The demo was good so now I&rsquo;m halfway through episode 2 and feeling the boomer shooter (or throwback retro shooter or whatever you want to call the subgenre) itch again. The result is more frantic research on the best pistol and rocket launcher types, the weirdest GZDoom ports, and the coolest Nightdive Studios remasters. Did you know they&rsquo;re remastering both <em>Outlaws</em> and <em>Blood</em>? Nightdive are my new heroes.</p>
<p>If you want to dive into the genre then let KIRK COLLECTS guide you. He releases monthly FPS news overview videos called &ldquo;State of the Boom&rdquo; and the last one revealed more exciting stuff is coming our way (<em>Boltgun 2</em>, <em>Darkenstein 3D</em>, &hellip;) next to an already awesome release month (<em>Forgive Me Father 2</em>, <em>Beyond Sunset</em>, &hellip;):</p>

<p>The <em>Blood</em> part is at <code>19:00</code>. But yeah, that <em>Deus Ex</em> remaster is looking ridiculously bad. I feel zero urge to play anything else besides the GOTY version in the original Unreal engine. What a shame.</p>
