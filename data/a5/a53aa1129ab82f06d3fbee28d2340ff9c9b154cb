<p>American climber Alex Honnold scaled Taipei 101 in Taipei on Sunday, climbing the 101-story tower without ropes or safety gear in a “free solo” ascent. Large crowds watched from the street as he worked his way up Taiwan’s tallest building, and he reached the top spire in roughly an hour and a half. The climb was organized and broadcast live by Netflix and took place after wet weather delayed the attempt by a day. Taiwan’s president publicly congratulated Honnold after he finished.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/es6cD_xan0QUXj35JC1fCwQaoCbAjldMq3K3icRAlAi44FF_hMA6TY0EW7PUR18oeYmAch-I4GVszFFwqZGmCF24aKPIIQw9WVT5z8G0KO4A6tBXFjBgZaDHatQeWFrfTiElSAMqohlZxCdZOCLZJ7oAC3oi48u_uwxt-XNZRFiluyFkEDhCm1Tz0v6AIb-jjQ3IlPpmQW0oURYLhSuUBlSEmrx6QJVqibLk_ukqFPL7fYc9NlL8gf8uhdO2D_GvGFDXGA3D5UjzUhQLaA' alt='US rock climber Alex Honnold climbs Taipei 101 without ropes or safety gear in Taipei on January 25, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Height and scale: Taipei 101 stands 508 metres (1,667 feet) tall, underscoring the scale of the route Honnold climbed.</li><li>Global niche: The New York Times notes Honnold is among only “a dozen or so” known skyscraper climbers worldwide.</li><li>Top-spire moment: After reaching the spire, Honnold told reporters, “What a beautiful way to see Taipei,” describing the view from the summit.</li><li>Longtime goal: Honnold said he first became interested in climbing the building more than a decade ago.</li><li>Local spotlight: DW reports Taiwan’s president congratulated Honnold, turning the feat into a moment of national attention for the landmark tower.</li></ul><blockquote>What a beautiful way to see Taipei - Alex Honnold</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Alex Honnold: He described the climb as a special way to take in the city from above after reaching the top spire.
