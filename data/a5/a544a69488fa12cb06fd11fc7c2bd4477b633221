<p>In the latest development, Ukrainian, Russian and U.S. envoys resumed closed-door peace talks in Abu Dhabi on Saturday, continuing the first known trilateral meeting format since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Negotiators are working through a U.S.-backed plan pushed by President Trump, but the most difficult questions remain territorial—especially the Donbas region—and whether any security arrangement (such as European peacekeepers) can win acceptance from both sides. The diplomatic push comes as Russia kept up air attacks that Ukrainian officials say worsened winter hardships, including damage that left parts of Kyiv without heat and fresh casualties reported in Kyiv and Kharkiv. Even so, the fact that all three delegations are still meeting suggests at least a shared interest in keeping dialogue going, with the UAE positioning itself as a facilitator of de-escalation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Uy0_9ldgRpsS3iK9ahQT2erqmZQQExfIjyP-73vCIvzRsC6ZKPWPQTcJWEEgKAvL0vkPJaHsLtrFJ062o7y-BJ82DwdsaA_5PDl8rByw-F7bEXjElJSLrin7wXBKJ9ZmtlZSc_4p6J2hnAxVgYnUsJFIHZtjOQ29d2DoLoDITH-HE5dUGg' alt='UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan meets delegation heads at the UAE-hosted trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi on Jan. 23, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who is there: Ukraine’s delegation includes national security chief Rustem Umerov, general staff chief Andrey Gnatov, negotiator David Arakhamia, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Kislitsa and Zelensky aide Kirill Budanov, while Russia is led by Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov and GRU chief Admiral Igor Kostyukov, with U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner representing Washington.</li><li>UAE mediation: The UAE foreign ministry said the talks are part of ongoing efforts to promote dialogue and find a political solution, and its foreign minister argued sustainable outcomes require “dialogue and de-escalation”.</li><li>Pressure points: Kyiv faces mounting U.S. pressure to reach a deal, as early versions of the U.S. plan drew criticism in Ukraine and Western Europe for favoring Moscow’s line, while later iterations drew Russian objections over the idea of European peacekeepers.</li><li>Parallel diplomacy: The Abu Dhabi meetings followed President Zelensky’s appearance in Davos and separate U.S. outreach that included President Trump meeting Zelensky at the World Economic Forum and envoy Steve Witkoff meeting President Putin in the Kremlin.</li><li>Security and economy: Russia said its team would focus on security issues, and the Kremlin said Witkoff was expected to meet Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev separately to discuss economic matters.</li></ul><blockquote>Sustainable solutions to conflicts can only be achieved through dialogue and de-escalation. - Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine (negotiating team): Ukraine said talks focused on parameters for ending the war and the logic of further negotiations, while President Zelensky emphasized territory—especially Donbas—as central and urged Russia to show readiness to end the war.
