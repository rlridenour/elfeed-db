<p>I got a strange email the other day. Here it is, with parts redacted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>My name is G&mdash;, I am the main editor at &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
<p>While browsing your site, I noticed you have an amazing article from this page:</p>
<p><em>Link to an extremely old post of mine</em></p>
<p>My team actually just published a comprehensive article on &ldquo;<em>Semi-related title</em>&rdquo; which I think your visitors would truly
appreciate and add value to your awesome article.</p>
<p>You can check it out here: &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>If you were willing to add our link to that page, I would be more than happy to share it to more than a thousand of our social followers to help you
gain some visibility in exchange.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think and thank you for your consideration!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>G&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p></blockquote>
<p>My mail program correctly marked it as spam, which I appreciate. (Besides the spammy feel of the text, the article of mine they reference is an &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; &gt;300 word blurb about a one-day project I did in 2017. Sheesh…) I was a little shocked that someone would ask me to engage in the kind of social-metrics-engineering which I feel has contributed directly to many of the social problems plaguing us today.</p>
<p>I decided to make a public promise that I would hold myself to. Here it is:</p>
<div class="info">
<p>I am a scholar. As such, I have a sacred duty to uphold truth at all times and to share knowledge freely. I will never do anything that might compromise my ability to do such. If there is anything beautiful, truthful, or honorable, I will promote it. I will never accept bribery or engage in influence peddling; I find it intellectually and morally repugnant to use my station as an academic for personal gain.</p>
</div>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make mistakes—and I won&rsquo;t stop talking about tools and services that I think genuinely serve my desires for greater knowledge, understanding, and freedom—but I will never do this in exchange for money, social clout, or whatever. If I attain any fame, it will not be because it was my end goal.</p>
<p>So, G&mdash;, here is what I think of your offer: <em>get lost—your proposal disgusts me</em>.</p>
