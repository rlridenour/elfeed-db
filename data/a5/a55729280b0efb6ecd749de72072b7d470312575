<p>Brian Krebs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world’s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a
majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things
(IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&amp;T, Comcast
and Verizon, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy
concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is
complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet’s
attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief
traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data
per second.</p>

<p>Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has
steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the
wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an
estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.</p>

<p>I guess those people who were declaring <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/02/27/internet-teddy-bear">a decade ago</a> that the Internet of Things would change the world were right.</p>
