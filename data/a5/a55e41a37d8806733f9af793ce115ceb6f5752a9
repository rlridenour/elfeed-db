I&rsquo;ve written several times about Álvaro Ramírez&rsquo;s DWIM tools [<a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10653">1</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10660">2</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10674">3</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10694">4</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10703">5</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10742">6</a>] and their use in easily invoking command line utilities from the comfort of Emacs. Ramírez has a large collection of such utilities built on the DWIM Tool framework but I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone else use it for their own work.

Now JTR over at <a href="https://taonaw.com">The Art Of Not Asking Why</a> has a post that <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/06/07/compressing-mp-files-while-keeping.html">describes his own use of DWIM Tools</a>. JTR wanted to compress videos while preserving their resolution. That&rsquo;s pretty easy to do using <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> and JTR knew how to do it but he decided to see if he could use DWIM Tools for the job.

It turned out to be pretty easy as you can read at JTR&rsquo;s post. The lesson I take from this is not that there&rsquo;s another application available under the DWIM Tools umbrella but that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to add one. If you have some command line utility that would be convenient to invoke from within Emacs, you should take a look at DWIM Tools. It&rsquo;s available <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command">from Melpa and GitHub</a>.</p>
