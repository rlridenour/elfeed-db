<p>From iyO’s home page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iyo one is a revolutionary new kind of computer without a
screen. it can run apps just like your smartphone. The key
difference is you talk to it through a natural language interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/23/io-iyo-aye-aye-aye">Like I wrote yesterday</a>, I’d never heard of iyO before. But from the description above, you can obviously see how they’d feel like the new OpenAI/LoveFrom io name stomps on their trademark. (One minor curiosity: iyO itself seems unsure how to capitalize the letters in its own name: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/iyO-IyO-iyo.png">a single cropped screenshot of their own home page</a> shows “iyO”, “IyO”, and “iyo”.)</p>

<p>iyO “graduated” from X (which is entirely separate from Elon Musk’s X), Google’s “moonshot factory”, in 2021. <a href="https://x.company/projects/iyo/">The description there</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iyO is on a mission to bring natural language computing to
billions of people. The team has created the world’s first audio
computer that you can talk to like a friend. While at X, the team
developed their initial prototypes. Now an independent company,
iyO is creating screenless, natural language computing with mixed
audio reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite having “graduated” four years ago, iyO is <a href="https://www.iyo.audio/products/iyo-one">still only taking pre-orders</a> for the iyO One, their ungainly-looking ear computer. ($100 seems too good to be true for what they’re promising. <strong>Update:</strong> Ah-ha, turns out $100 is just the pre-order deposit. They’re <a href="https://www.shop.iyo.audio/shop/p/iyo-one">going to cost $1,000 to $1,200</a> if they ever actually ship, which I think is a big <em>if</em> — this thing has vaporware written all over it.)</p>

<p>Lastly, last April, iyO founder and CEO Jason Rugolo demonstrated prototypes <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jason_rugolo_welcome_to_the_world_of_audio_computers">in a 13-minute TED talk</a>. Seems cool, but some of the features already exist with AirPods, and all of the feature <em>could</em> exist with AirPods. I don’t see the future of a dedicated audio computer — especially ones as ugly as these — when the entire feature set can be duplicated with smart earbuds paired to your phone.</p>
