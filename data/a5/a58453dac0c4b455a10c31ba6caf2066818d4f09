Phone and Journal come from the iPhone, while Games is entirely new. Below, we provide an overview of each of these apps.<br/>
<br/>
macOS Tahoe is currently available as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-macos-tahoe-developer-beta/">developer beta</a>, and the update will likely be released to the general public in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Phone</h2><br/>

Macs could already answer iPhone calls thanks to Apple's cross-platform Continuity features, but macOS Tahoe goes a step further.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/phone-app-macos-tahoe/">expanded the Phone app to the Mac</a>, complete with all of the new features coming to the app with iOS 26, such as Hold Assist, Call Screening, Live Translation, and more. The app syncs with your iPhone, allowing you to view recent phone calls and expanded contact cards, listen to voicemail messages, and more directly on your Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple describes the Phone app on Mac:<blockquote>The Phone app on Mac has the familiar features of the Phone app on iPhone — including Recents, Favorites, and Voicemails — and the latest updates like Call Screening and Hold Assist. Call Screening automatically answers calls from unknown numbers and asks the caller for information so a user can decide whether or not to answer. And when a user is stuck on hold, Hold Assist allows them to keep their spot in line while they wait for a live agent, so users can continue working on their Mac.</blockquote><h2>Journal</h2><br/>

Apple introduced a Journal app on the iPhone with iOS 17, and it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/journal-app-finally-coming-to-mac-and-ipad/">now available on the Mac too</a>. You can use this app to type out your daily thoughts, and you can include drawings, handwriting, photos, videos, audio recordings, and more.<br/>
<br/>
On the Mac, users can take advantage of the Journal app's new features, including the options to create multiple journals and view the locations of journal entries on a map.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Games</h2><br/>
