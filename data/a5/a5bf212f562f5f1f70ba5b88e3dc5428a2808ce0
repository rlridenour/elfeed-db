<p>Claims about budget shortfalls and the economic benefits of layoffs, program cuts, and restructurings must be investigated, proper procedures must be enforced, and administrators must be held accountable.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen plenty of <a href="https://dailynous.com/category/cuts-and-threats-to-philosophy-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examples</a> in which this hasn&#8217;t happened.</p>
<p>But it did happen at Portland State, where an arbitration ruling earlier this month ordered the university to give the laid-off professors their jobs back.</p>
<p>A faculty member writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You may have followed the <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/01/21/portland-state-philosophy-protests-administrative-malfeasance/">saga of the three faculty members in the Philosophy Department at Portland State</a> who lost their jobs this past year. Through our Union (AAUP), they and seven other laid-off PSU faculty filed a grievance, which went to formal arbitration. We have fantastic news to report: The judgment was announced earlier this week that they have won their grievance. The arbitrator made the unequivocal decision that “the grievants are to be restored to the positions they held prior to layoff and made whole for any losses sustained.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>This decision is important not just for our colleagues and our department but for other departments around the country facing cuts. The PSU administration did not follow proper procedure and did not engage in shared governance. It is gratifying that this was recognized and that the University will now need to reverse the decisions.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As we are all aware, these are very difficult times for universities all around the US. What this decision shows is that even when universities are facing budget cuts, administrators still have to fulfill their contractual obligations and treat their employees with decency.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We are extremely grateful to everyone who showed support for our department and colleagues.</em></p>
<p>According to the arbitrator, Dorothy C. Foley, &#8220;the university made its layoff decisions before it had sufficient evidence to support them. That is a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.&#8221;</p>
