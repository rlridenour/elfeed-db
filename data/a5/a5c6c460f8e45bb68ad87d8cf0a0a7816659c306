I use find-grep daily to find a &ldquo;today in previous journals&rdquo; (which is one of the only true services Facebook provides, for those who don&rsquo;t value their privacy). Those entries then go into each day of my daily journal. The trouble is, after you do this for a few years, a big chunk of your daily matches are those same matches from yester-year. I organize my journals by year, so really I just want the first entry that matches a day for each year, and I don&rsquo;t need the sub-entries.
