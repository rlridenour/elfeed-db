The an upcoming version of watchOS will bring a visionOS-like redesign to the Apple Watch, much like the design updates coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a> and macOS 16, claims Israeli site <em><a href="https://theverifier.co.il/71516/exclusive-watchos-apple-intelligence-hi-visionos/">The Verifier</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>

watchOS will eventually have "elements" of visionOS, including a look that is bolder, slightly transparent, and with a floating aesthetic. Buttons, menus, icons, and other user interface elements will reportedly be refreshed, with Apple "working on several ideas" for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>. <em>The Verifier</em> does not know when these design changes will come, as the features are allegedly still being developed.<br/>
<br/>
The site also claims that Apple is working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> and the Apple Watch Ultra. The Apple Watch Ultra will allegedly get a new, exclusive chip that will allow it to run &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, though this is a questionable claim because Apple has been bringing &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features to as many devices as possible, not restricting the functionality to its higher-end products.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the devices announced since WWDC 2024, only the most recent low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> does not support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;. Everything else, including the mid-budget <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, features &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;. Allegedly, the Apple Watch Ultra will get &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; first, with the feature set to come to other Apple Watch models "a year later."<br/>
<br/>
As of right now, the Apple Watch models only have 1GB RAM, and &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; requires 8GB RAM at a minimum, so that is another red flag with <em>The Verifier</em>'s claims. The site says that &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features on Apple Watch will include notification summaries, the ability to create <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>, and a "new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>" that understands user behavior and garners information from "sports activity, AI medical monitoring, sleep tracking, heart rate activity, and more."<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that <em>The Verifier</em> doesn't have the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theverifier-co-il/">best track record</a> when it comes to rumors. Last year, the site said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> would get a visionOS redesign, which didn't happen. Other rumors that have not panned out have included <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> for the Apple Watch, a kids mode for the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, the launch date for a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, and several incorrect predictions about different versions of iOS dropping support for older devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/apple-watch-visionos-design/">Apple Watch Could Get visionOS-Like Redesign, Apple Intelligence Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-could-get-visionos-like-redesign-apple-intelligence-support.2455029/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
