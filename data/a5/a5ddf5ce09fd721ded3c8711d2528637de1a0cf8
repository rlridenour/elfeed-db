<p>Seth Godin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can’t.</p>

<p>That’s because toddlers don’t understand what an argument is and
aren’t interesting in having one.</p>

<p>Toddlers (which includes defensive bureaucrats, bullies, flat
earthers, folks committed to a specific agenda and radio talk show
hosts) may indicate that they’d like to have an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohDB5gbtaEQ">argument</a>, but
they’re actually engaging in connection, noise, play acting or a
chance to earn status. It can be fun to be in opposition, to
harangue or even to use power to change someone’s position.</p>
