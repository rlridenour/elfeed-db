I used to manage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)">SSH</a> connection with such GUI apps as <a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/">MobaXterm</a>, when I wrote code on Windows at work. As I changed my workflow to use a tiling window manager in a <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> guest OS, I continued to improve my way of managing SSH connections, which I want to share here if you don&#39;t know yet.</p>
<p>
At first, I baked a helper Python script, which I named as qssh for &#34;quick ssh&#34;, to help me assemble ssh arguments for me(such as username, Ip, port, etc.), so that I can easily access a host by giving it only one argument, e.g. <code class="verbatim">qssh foo</code>.</p>
