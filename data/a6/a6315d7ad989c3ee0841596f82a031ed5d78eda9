  and I am sharing it as a fellow Emacs user. ]</p>

<p>Peter Prevos has just published the book <em>Emacs Writing Studio</em>. It is
a high quality resource for those who want to use Emacs to write at
length (books, scientific papers, personal notes, …). EWS comes with
an accompanying Emacs configuration to help users get started. Peter
used this configuration to produce EWS!</p>

<p>Buy the book from one of the many available bookstores listed here:

<p>Below is the foreword to EWS that I wrote.</p>

<hr />

<p>With <em>Emacs Writing Studio</em> you have what you need to get started with
writing. The book and the concomitant configuration for Emacs provide
a solid foundation for you to organise your ideas, capture
information, and elucidate your thoughts.</p>

<p>This book provides an overview of Emacs’ capabilities for writers. It
does it in a way that is approachable. You get the essentials and are
then guided through the various facets of the workflow.</p>

<p>Consider <em>Emacs Writing Studio</em> a companion on a long journey. It
helps you get started with Emacs and will be there for you as a
valuable reference when you need to do something a little bit more
advanced but forgot how to proceed.</p>

<p>What you get at the outset is a curated experience. This is exactly
what you need to get on with the task of writing: it minimises
distractions. Though do not think of it as a constraint: you are still
using Emacs — a powerful tool that can be reprogrammed or extended
to do more with text and related patterns of interaction. The <em>Emacs
Writing Studio</em> setup consists of sensible defaults. You will not be
locked in to a bespoke system. This is the standard Emacs experience
and you are free to modify it to your liking.</p>

<p>You can always find more resources to address whatever issue you may
have. Beside the official manual of Emacs, you will discover a rich
corpus of knowledge produced by the community. There are blog posts,
drawings, and video demonstrations. They will all apply to what you
have here.</p>

<p>No configuration can be a replacement for the work you put in. This is
true for your time using Emacs but also for writing in general. Do not
come with the expectation that <em>Emacs Writing Studio</em> will do miracles
for you: it will not make you an Emacs expert overnight and it will
not boost your creativity without you doing anything.</p>

<p>This is a tool that has been tested and proven to work well. Like
every tool, it must be used properly by someone who has the requisite
skills or is willing to acquire them through continuous practice. As a
beginner, you will not know much: the book is here to ensure that you
find the information you need to keep going.</p>

<p>The expectation you can have is that <em>Emacs Writing Studio</em> will
deliver on its promise of giving you a set of tools for authoring your
next works. It will do it in a reliable way. The rest is up to you:
conduct the research and start creating.</p>

<p>Beside the technicalities, this book will make you think about matters
of method. It does it indirectly through the functions it describes.
You then have to consider how each of those will fit in to your
workflow.</p>

<p>Piecing together a set of tools or procedures is part of the process
of discovery that authors must go through. Through trial and error,
you figure out what works for you. You may then stick with it and
strongly prefer it over alternative approaches. Whether your methods
are appropriate for others does not really matter: you know that one
size does not fit all.</p>

<p>Emacs is the perfect tool for those who want to be particular with
their writing. It is highly configurable and will grow with you as a
user to always match your current level. If you do ever get the chance
to learn some Emacs Lisp, you will realise that there is so much you
can do to tweak every little thing exactly how you want it to be.</p>

<p>The key to learning your way around Emacs is to be patient and
methodical. Try one thing at a time, learn how to use it, and then
move on to the next one. This is why <em>Emacs Writing Studio</em> is
helpful: it lets you experiment at your own pace while giving you
something that works well out-of-the-box.</p>

<p>Remember that you are just getting started and you will be here
long-term. Good luck!</p>
