<p>iPhone sales are important! That’s about as obvious as a <a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/524330">dog-bites-man statement</a> can get.</p>
<p>This year, early reports suggest <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2917157/the-rarified-air.html">sales of the iPhone 17 might be a little better than expected</a>, but there’s no accompanying surge for the iPhone Air. What does it all mean?!</p>
<p>On one level, not a lot: Apple’s still going to sell a zillion iPhones, in the end. The profits will roll on. But if you’re a sicko like me (and I will remind you that you are reading this column at a site devoted to Apple-related minutiae), you are probably interested in the details.</p>
<p>They’re meaningful for a few reasons: If Apple’s expectations don’t match reality, it suggests the company doesn’t fully understand its own customers. If one model really kills it, it potentially impacts overall iPhone revenue (for better or for worse). And perhaps most importantly for most iPhone users: How the world reacts to iPhone models affects Apple’s plans for <em>future</em> iPhone models.</p>
