</ul><h1>Tasty, Perhaps</h1><p>Every now and then, we sell something from a well-known brand like KIND or Bevita, and the pitch is pretty simple: buy 'em if you like ‘em. But these fit into a different category, the snack you’ve probably never heard of.</p>
<p>Like, they have 800+ reviews on Amazon, which isn’t nothing. But compare that to some of the offerings from the companies we mentioned above, which can run into the 50s of thousands on one flavor alone, and, well, yeah, 800 ain’t that impressive.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, let’s go through some likely questions you have.</p>
<p><strong>Are these protein bars?</strong></p>
<p>Yes and no. Yes, as in they have protein. But not just any protein. It’s Mark Bell’s Steak Shake Compete Spectrum Animal Protein Powder Complex, which really feels like a mouthful, especially for a product that is otherwise trying to get away with super minimalistic branding. (“Clean. Simple. Delicious.”)</p>
<p>While we admit that we don’t know much about Mark Bell other than that he seems to earn a living by being really jacked, it does seem like this particular protein blend is a bit less unsettlingly artificial than what you usually see in bars like this.</p>
<p>So no, this isn’t some sort of pre-workout or post-workout protein bomb that delivers a bazillion grams of the stuff and tastes creepy and artificial. But yes, it does give you a solid ten grams and tastes great doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any weird ingredients, like a bizarre sweetener or something?</strong></p>
<p>So there’s that Steak Shake protein complex. Check the label and see what you think about that. But even if you include that and all of its sub-ingredients, there’s a pretty straightforward list of stuff in here—peanut butter, coconut oil, chocolate chips, etc. There’s some stevia pretty far down on the list. Some people feel strongly one way or the other about that.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s your call.</p>
<p>Which brings us to our final question.</p>
<p><strong>Should I buy these?</strong></p>
<p>They’re a buck a piece. We both know the answer here.</p>
