<p>Tony Maglio, The Hollywood Reporter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The Savant</em>, which originally had a Sept. 26 premiere date, was
yanked in the weeks following the Sept. 10 assassination of
conservative political pundit Charlie Kirk. Language on the
<a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/the-savant/umc.cmc.aar44keiny3h54xvaakg260q">landing page for the series</a> has since vacillated from
“Coming Soon” to “At a Later Date” to simply “2025.” As of this
writing, the wording again reads, “At a Later Date.” (Lower down
the same page it says, “Released: 2025” — likely an oversight.)</p>

<p>It’s odd the language has been tweaked several times over the
course of the month. Altering wording on the app is a manual
process, and since each new iterative phrase basically means the
same as the last, why do it? Yes, “Soon” means soon and “Later”
means later and “2025” literally means this calendar year, but
it’s all close enough considering the shifting language was first
noticed as summer turned to fall. To not premiere in 2025 feels
like a death sentence for the series.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Apple TV did not respond to The Hollywood
Reporter’s requests for comment. A spokesperson for The Savant’s
studio, Fifth Season, also declined comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ominous vibe.</p>
