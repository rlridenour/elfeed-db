<li>Can it make a margarita: Gross (and yes, we’ve done this joke before, but c’mon, it’s still gross)</li>
</ul><h1>Feline Hungry</h1><p>While researching this product, we watched <a href="https://www.amazon.com/live/video/02536315b6514a8d8535be64a29b1db8?tag=mehdown-20">a video on Amazon</a> that explains why this stuff is called “Dashi Delights.”</p>
<p>Here’s what we learned.</p>
<p>You start with:</p>

<p>Informative, right? Except, there seems to be one thing missing.</p>
<p>THE PART WHERE THE DELICIOUS BROTH BECOMES FUCKING CAT FOOD!</p>
<p>Look, personally, we don’t get this weird farce that pet food companies seem to always be pushing. Seriously, stop pretending you’ve got a team of Iron Chefs in some room, whipping up wet food one container at a time.</p>
<p>Sure, some brands are better than others. They use better ingredients and, in turn, produce a better product. INABA is one of those brands. But we don’t have to pretend they’re making the perfect dashi for Mittens’s before-bed snack.</p>
<p>And even if they were, your cats might still turn up their noses to it. Because that’s just how cats are. So, if you want to try a fancy-ish cat food, you might as well buy it from us. Because you get a lot of it for not a lot of money. If your cat likes it, great! You’ve got plenty to go around. And if they don’t, you can give it to a friend or a cat shelter and seem extremely generous while only spending 24 bucks.</p>
<p>Now, if you don’t mind, we’re gonna order some soup. That video made us a little hungry. The dashi part, we mean. Not the cat food part.</p>
