<p>A lot of details are missing from the story, but the <em>Post </em>says it was told by sources that during a discussion in his ethics class on the topic of a &#8220;utilitarian society,&#8221; the student made what were characterized as &#8220;unwelcome comments.&#8221; As for what the student might have said, we only have the <em>Post&#8217;s </em>characterization of them as expressing &#8220;a controversial stance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <em>Post</em> says, &#8220;parents caught wind of the commentary and complained to school administrators.&#8221; The student was called to the office on the first floor of the school. He was &#8220;awaiting potential disciplinary action&#8221; there, &#8220;but then walked up to the fifth floor and jumped.&#8221; He was taken to the hospital; a couple of hours later he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>The student&#8217;s death occurred on Thursday (whether that was the same day the discussion of &#8220;utilitarian society&#8221; took place is unclear).</p>
