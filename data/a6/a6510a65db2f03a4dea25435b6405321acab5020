<p>Over the past year, I've started using AI a lot in my development
  workflows, and the impact has been significant, saving me hundreds
  of hours of tedious work. But it isn't just the productivity. It's
  the fundamental shift in my process. I'm finding myself increasingly
  just throwing problems at the AI to see what it does.  Often enough,
  I'm genuinely surprised and delighted by the results. It's like
  having a brilliant, unpredictable, and occasionally completely
  insane junior programmer at my beck and call, and it is starting to
  change the way I solve problems.</p>

<p>I anthropomorphize my AI tools.  I am well aware of how they work
  and how the illusion of intelligence is created, but I find it much
  more entertaining to imagine them as agents with wants and desires.
  It makes me laugh out loud to see an AI tool &ldquo;get
  frustrated&rdquo; at errors or to &ldquo;feel proud&rdquo; of a
  solution despite the fact that I know that the tool isn't even
  modelling emotions, let alone experiencing them.</p>

<p>These days, AI is being integrated into all sorts of different
  tools, but we're not at a point where a single AI can retain context
  across different tools.  Each tool has its own separate instance of
  an AI model, and none of them share context with each other.
  Furthermore, each tool and AI has its own set of capabilities and
  limitations.  This means that I have to use multiple different AI
  tools in my workflows, and I have to keep mental track of which tool
  has which context.  This is a lot easier to manage if I give each tool a
  unique persona.  One tool is the &ldquo;world-weary noir
  detective&rdquo;, another is the &ldquo;snobby butler&rdquo;, still
  another is the &ldquo;enthusiastic intern&rdquo;.  My
  anthropomorphizing brain naturally assumes that the noir detective
  and the snobby butler have no shared context and move in different
  circles.</p>

<p>(The world-weary detective isn't <em>actually</em> world weary &mdash; he has only Chandler on his bookshelf.  The snobby butler is straight out of Wodehouse.  My brain is projecting the personality on top.  It adds psychological &ldquo;color&rdquo; to the text that my subconscious finds very easy to pick up on. It is important that various personas are <em>archetypes</em> &mdash; we want them to be easy to recognize, we're not looking for depth and nuance. )</p>

<p>I've always found the kind of person who names their car or their house to be a little... strange. It struck me as an unnerving level of anthropomorphism. And yet, here I am, not just naming my software tools, but deliberately cultivating personalities for them, a whole cast of idiosyncratic digital collaborators. Maybe I should take a step back from the edge ...but not yet.  It's just too damn useful. And way too much fun. So I'll be developing software with my crazy digital intern, my hardboiled detective, and my snobbish butler.  The going is getting weird, it's time to turn pro.</p>
