<li>One set is for infusing gin</li>
<li>It does not need to be used for infusing gin</li>
<li>The other sets provide a variety of tasty African spice &amp; salt blends</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but maybe they could infuse some tequila?</li>
</ul><h1>Glass & More</h1><p>Perusing the Amazon page for this gin infusion spice set, I came across my favorite review ever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot comment on flavour and, until I get some feedback, I cannot say about value for money. From a giver’s point of view I would say it was acceptable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five stars!</p>
<p>And, to be fair, this is one of the more detailed of the reviews. Many are like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Loved these, and experimenting with flavors. Easy to use, great value, quality item!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, thank you, Amazon Customer. I definitely trust this to be real.</p>
<p>Also, of note: not a single review actually mentions, you know, infusing gin with any of the spices included in the set. Which, to be fair, feels more like a selling point than a red flag. As <a href="/@OnionSoup">@OnionSoup</a> said last time we sold this stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love gin but… there’s no way I can drink 16 bottles of gin before this goes off… I go through maybe one bottle every 18-24 months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I totally agree. But you could always use some pink peppercorns and thyme and rosemary for something else, right?</p>
<p>The Amazon reviews of the African Spirit collection are a bit more detailed. For example, feast your eyes on this one from Artimus Pyle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prepare your taste buds for a voyage across the vast, diverse landscapes of Africa with African Spirit—a collection of spice blends so vibrant and aromatic, they could revive even the dullest dish from the depths of culinary despair. Each blend feels like a celebration of regional traditions, capturing the soul of centuries-old flavors in every pinch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JFC.</p>
<p>And that’s only the first paragraph!</p>
<p>User WN, meanwhile, shared this little tidbit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for my RV…providing me the perfect seasoning for my cooking on the road…without bringing so many different seasonings at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this applies if you’re living the RV life or vacationing in an AirBnB where you’ll be doing the cooking. These little vials allow you to bring along a bunch of flavor without taking up a bunch of space.</p>
<p>And if you don’t use all of them–in the African Spirit or the Gin O’Clock set–@@stolicat made a great point on our last sale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s pretty much worth the price just for the 16 nice glass tubes with caps. Reminds me of the glass cigar tubes of yesteryear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a tube sale with bonus spices! Rad, right?</p>
<p>Also, from the comments on that sale, apparently, the boxes smell great when you open them.</p>
<p>Anyway, buy some if you like spices.</p>
