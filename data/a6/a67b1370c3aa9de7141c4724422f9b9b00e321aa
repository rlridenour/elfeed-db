<h3 id="time-for-a-fresh-start">Time for a fresh start</h3>
<p>In the spirit of a fresh start for the new year,[^1] I’ve transitioned my to do list from Taskpaper format to todo.txt. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages so as I always say, you just need to pick a set of faults you can live with.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between Taskpaper and todo.txt isn’t in the format (they’re very similar), but in how I’m setting up the file. Previously I tried to move tasks under project headings, or at least group them into broad areas. It might look nice, and yes, you can navigate even a large file with the help of Markdown headers, but I wasn’t motivated to keep up with the housekeeping side of things. Pretty soon my inbox was huge and growing.</p>
<p>Granted, this was due to how <em>I</em> was using the Taskpaper format, not due to the format itself.</p>
<p>Now my file is ordered solely by the order in which tasks were added. Seems like a small thing, but it feels like a weight off my shoulders! This type of simplicity is definitely a distraction buster.</p>
<p>As you read about how I’ve made todo.txt work in Obsidian, keep in mind that I’m well aware there are far more complex ways than these to surface targeted information in a file. This is a rabbit hole I’m actively choosing to avoid because of my propensity for falling in and forgetting to actually do the work!</p>
<h3 id="todo.txt-basics">todo.txt basics</h3>
<p>To work with a todo.txt file in Obsidian you’ll need to change the file type to Markdown. <code>todo.md</code> and <code>todo.txt.md</code> are equally valid options.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick primer of the todo.txt format (<a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt" target="_blank">source</a>):</p>
<p>Incomplete tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>If priority exists, it <span class="small-caps">ALWAYS</span> appears first</li>
<li>A task’s creation date may optionally appear directly after priority and a space</li>
<li>Contexts and Projects may appear anywhere in the line after priority/prepended date</li>
</ul>
<p>Complete tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>A completed task starts with an lowercase x character</li>
<li>The date of completion appears directly after the x, separated by a space</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ol start="4" type="A">
<li>2024-10-10 Find out how to list all homebrew-installed apps @learn</li>
<li>2025-01-18 Edit and schedule article</li>
<li>2024-10-14 +work Resolve <span class="small-caps">9000M</span> downloadable calendars</li>
<li>+home Mending x 2025-01-18 2025-01-03 +work Combine plain text accounting files (this task is complete)</li>
</ol>
<p>I add the date to the front of tasks as they’re entered not because I’ve actively started a task, but so I can see how long it’s been sitting there.</p>
<h3 id="sorting-through-the-mess">Sorting through the mess</h3>
<p>Obsidian has a couple of todo.txt plugins to choose from but I prefer to rely on queries to show useful subsets of tasks.[^2] Here are some that I use to show—</p>
<p>All incomplete tasks in the +HOME area with priority (B): <code>file:"2025-todo.txt" line:("(B)" +home -x)</code></p>
<p>All (C) priority incomplete tasks in each of my four areas: <code>file:"2025-todo.txt" line:(+church "(C)" -x OR +work "(C)" -x OR +home "(C)" -x  OR +emw "(C)" -x)</code></p>
<p>All (A) priority incomplete tasks in either my task file or current <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/126-dash-plus-system-in-obtf-and-analog-notes"><span class="small-caps">OBTF</span></a>: <code>file:"2025-todo.txt" line:("(A)" -x) OR  file:"2025 OBTF" line:("(A)" -x)</code></p>
<p>These strings can be entered into the search box, saved as Bookmarks, or embedded into other pages in the form of a query.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<pre class="query"><code>file:"2025-todo.txt" line:("(B)" +home -x)</code></pre>
<p>Note that queries in Obsidian aren’t case sensitive (sometimes I wish they were!). You can see that not all tasks have a project or a date and they don’t need to have a priority. Rather than using priorities to represent importance of a task, I use them for when I intend to do the work.</p>
<p>The letters A–E in my system therefore represent Today, This Week, This Month, This Quarter, and Long Term. Here’s how I remember them:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol type="A">
<li>= Action (Today)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="A">
<li>= Begin (This Week)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="A">
<li>= Checkpoint (This Month)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="4" type="A">
<li>= Drive (This Quarter)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="5" type="A">
<li>= Eventually (Long Term)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Projects each have their own page, so I only use projects in todo.txt to represent broad areas like +home and +work.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-sub-tasks">What about sub tasks?</h3>
<p>As soon as a task needs to have another task completed before it can be started, I either add them both to a dedicated project page, or piggy back the tasks together by removing the line breaks between them. As the front task is completed, it’s separated from the rest by a line break.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>A task with a dependency:<br>
<em>(A) Open account at <span class="small-caps">XYZ</span> (B) Transfer $50 into <span class="small-caps">XYZ</span> account</em></p>
<p>First task done, second task ready 2 seconds later:<br>
_x (A) Open account at XYZ&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2" type="A">
<li>Transfer $50 into <span class="small-caps">XYZ</span> account_</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>Keeping a todo.txt formatted task file in Obsidian has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wiki links to project pages elsewhere in your vault</li>
<li>Easily accessible wherever you use Obsidian (e.g.&nbsp;mobile devices)</li>
<li>Same sync and version control as your vault, no need to set up anything else</li>
<li>An editor you’re already familiar with</li>
</ul>
<p>Queries in Obsidian work well for the todo.txt format, but sadly there’s no custom sorting. Results display in the order in which they appear in the list of tasks.</p>
<p>Next week I’ll cover ways of interacting with a todo.txt file outside of Obsidian. Custom sorting and other useful features await!</p>

<p>[^1] Fresh starts can take place as often as you like, as long as they don’t distract from whatever the<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>start’ is supposed to be leading you towards. I don’t do New Year’s resolutions, but I do like a fresh way of looking at my files every now and then.</p>
<p>[^2] I’m not a coding or query expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I’ve found some that seem to work okay. Let me know if you have a better way of doing it!</p>
