<p>US and Ukrainian officials in Florida agreed to hold a third straight day of talks as they work on a peace and security framework to end Russia’s full-scale invasion and secure Ukraine’s future after the fighting stops. The delegations described the discussions as &quot;productive&quot; and &quot;constructive&quot; and said they had made headway on elements of a postwar security architecture, while stressing that any genuine breakthrough ultimately depends on Russia choosing to de-escalate and halt its attacks. The Miami meetings follow US envoy Steve Witkoff’s recent trip to Moscow, where he briefed Ukrainian officials on his encounter with President Vladimir Putin before continuing detailed talks on President Trump’s initial 28‑point peace plan, which has been leaked to the media. Both sides say much of the diplomacy is happening behind the scenes, and they have urged Russia to show a serious commitment to long‑term peace, including steps toward de‑escalation and an end to killings.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/N9lZRaaJhx_mm1Xh65V3Kke3wH_fRtLTOasdV4xQh9rhFgIxQk5T3bUy-DlgNxpmhbHwUcDfTD2z5Q3ExAlcid6CbFlErbJIC1tnnl6hssJXqvc6N3bUk7FQimuSDImJb0j-hHNG6JeBkNYwaBfdXuCJJIYpEcFmXrqyHORKpBHhHL1a7EiZ1lxan85sxXmIlP3qX76PXmPKLZz1UUVX8sCx1Gs3f0g_UjOrx18bwJh6rZkRl5gQNnSuYw' alt='US envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Jared Kushner meet Ukrainian officials in Hallandale Beach, Florida, during peace and security talks.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Focus of framework: Officials say the talks aim to build a long-term security framework for Ukraine that would define its defense guarantees and support once active combat ends, rather than a simple temporary ceasefire arrangement.</li><li>Role of envoys: The US team includes special envoy Steve Witkoff and presidential adviser Jared Kushner, who have been central to briefing Kyiv on their Moscow discussions and shaping the peace plan details with Ukrainian counterparts.</li><li>Behind-the-scenes diplomacy: A senior adviser in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office noted that much of the negotiation work is taking place away from public view, reflecting the sensitivity of potential compromises and security guarantees under discussion.</li><li>European financial debates: While the Miami talks proceed, European leaders met separately to discuss channeling profits from frozen Russian state assets to help finance Ukraine’s reconstruction and defense needs, adding a financial dimension to diplomatic efforts.</li><li>US characterization: The US State Department has described the Miami discussions as &quot;constructive&quot; and confirmed that they will continue, signaling Washington’s view that the process is moving in a useful direction even without a concrete agreement yet.</li></ul><blockquote>Both parties agreed that real progress toward any agreement depends on Russia&#x27;s readiness to show serious commitment to long-term peace, including steps toward de-escalation and cessation of killings. - Steve Witkoff</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States government: US officials describe the Miami talks with Ukraine as productive and constructive, emphasizing that they have made progress on a security framework while insisting that Russia must take concrete steps toward de-escalation for any agreement to be reached.
