<p>President Trump posted on social media that the airspace &quot;above and surrounding&quot; Venezuela should be considered &quot;closed in its entirety,&quot; intensifying a long-running US pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro’s government over alleged links to drug trafficking and &quot;narcoterrorists&quot;. The statement followed a recent buildup of US military assets in the Caribbean and a series of US strikes on boats Washington says were used by drug cartels in international waters near Venezuela. Venezuela’s government &quot;forcefully&quot; rejected the post as an illegal &quot;colonialist threat&quot; that violates its sovereignty and international law, and warned that any move against its civil aviation or airlines would be treated as a hostile act. The US Federal Aviation Administration had already urged airlines to use &quot;extreme caution&quot; near Venezuelan territory because of a worsening security environment, prompting several carriers to halt flights, while Caracas in turn banned some of those airlines for allegedly supporting US &quot;state terrorism&quot;. Despite the sharp rhetoric on both sides, Trump offered no operational details or legal basis for the claimed closure, leaving aviation experts and regional governments trying to interpret whether this was policy guidance, political messaging, or a precursor to further action.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/XpmyT_nt3r3bESuGOMcZzWSAl-vZRVdHxbM_WJnwd_MTGKzHTfKDtxXMEVMEWrh-M-bnNNaAiQ19auP6OvvkN46eiJTHw165UXr3CFjuaPaB5e5ezPAxod1Rds1bcSxl4PZwaIO-H5HeymPsV2JEVwkYUGz-BOgfn_2C0U0x6pkIl1UGxJkJqG0tYurkYNrLstzXzQiXFDzsqqCcfJ_jxBK0Ov0-' alt='Venezuela&#x27;s flag flies near the presidential palace in Caracas as tensions rise over control of the country&#x27;s airspace.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Drug-trafficking rationale: US officials have framed the broader campaign as a move to disrupt what Trump describes as Venezuelan &quot;narcoterrorist&quot; networks and alleged cartel-linked maritime smuggling routes in the Caribbean and nearby international waters.</li><li>Venezuelan countermeasures: In response to rising tensions, Venezuela’s armed forces carried out coastal military exercises broadcast on state television, showcasing antiaircraft systems and artillery deployments along shore areas.</li><li>Civil aviation fallout: Following US regulator warnings and Venezuelan bans, at least six foreign airlines have seen flights to or from Venezuela suspended, further isolating the country’s already limited international air links.</li><li>Repatriation flights risk: Caracas said that disruption of airspace and commercial routes could interrupt ongoing flights that return Venezuelan migrants from the United States, a program the Trump administration has publicly highlighted.</li><li>Legal authority questions: US media noted that while Washington can direct US-registered carriers via the FAA, Trump’s unilateral declaration that foreign airspace is &quot;closed&quot; lacks clear legal authority under international aviation rules, creating confusion for non-US airlines.</li></ul><blockquote>Please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US government: Trump’s message to airlines, pilots, &quot;drug dealers&quot; and human traffickers that Venezuelan airspace should be treated as closed was presented as part of efforts to intensify pressure on Maduro’s government and combat drug trafficking in the region.
