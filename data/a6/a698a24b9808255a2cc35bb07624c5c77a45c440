<p>President Trump directed the Pentagon to &quot;use all available funds&quot; so U.S. service members receive their next paycheck on October 15 despite the federal government shutdown [bbc.com#1][japantoday.com#1][theguardian.com#1]. He said his administration had &quot;identified funds&quot; to cover the payroll, though he did not specify the sources or total publicly [thehindu.com#1][csmonitor.com#1]. Politico reported that roughly $8 billion would be shifted from Defense Department research, development, testing and evaluation accounts that have two-year availability to meet the payroll [politico.com#1]. The move ensures troops are paid even as many other federal employees are set to miss paychecks on October 15, and comes as the shutdown nears its third week amid a congressional stalemate [csmonitor.com#1;</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/nNjJ-yO6tiCEO0ATcmb1WpLP3jtSi22R9EKYrGZoUP09gVhJSGC-LHATlqghTbv6HVcgWzF8O9VaJ9tya1Y_fplrZJa5rGmDIiIV5EGdIpHdNYwNQyUrg5534salu3cFTKwjVATdABKGMmdpttkU8XB_Ttui7or04CDNQobaJQJwbVJkde31HvenGbwOFemj' alt='President Trump has directed the Pentagon to use available funds to pay U.S. troops during the shutdown.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Funding directive: The president told the Defense Department to &quot;use all available funds&quot; to ensure troops are paid during the shutdown [bbc.com#1][japantoday.com#1][theguardian.com#1].</li><li>Payment date: The directive aims to guarantee military paychecks on October 15 despite the lapse in appropriations [theguardian.com#1][scmp.com#1][politico.com#1].</li><li>Source of money: About $8 billion will be shifted from research, development, testing and evaluation accounts with two-year availability to fund pay [politico.com#1].</li><li>Who still misses pay: Other federal employees are set to miss paychecks on October 15 because of the shutdown [csmonitor.com#1].</li><li>Congress dynamics: Republican leaders opposed a standalone troop pay bill, while Rep.
