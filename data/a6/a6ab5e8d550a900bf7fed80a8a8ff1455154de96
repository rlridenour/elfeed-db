<p>Christie’s auction house in London has sold Fabergé’s famed Winter Egg, a crystal-and-diamond Imperial Easter egg made in 1913 for Russia’s Tsar Nicholas II to give to his mother, for £22.9 million, about $30–42 million depending on currency conversion references, setting a new world auction record for any work by the House of Fabergé. The 10-centimetre-tall piece, carved from rock crystal and decorated with a platinum snowflake motif and thousands of tiny diamonds, is one of only about 50 Imperial eggs ever created and among just seven still in private hands, which helped drive intense international bidding. Christie’s described the object, commissioned shortly before Russia’s revolution, as one of Fabergé’s finest technical and artistic achievements, and specialists compared its status in decorative arts to that of the Mona Lisa in painting. The buyer, who chose to remain anonymous, paid well above the egg’s estimate of more than £20 million, more than doubling the previous auction record for a Fabergé egg set by the Rothschild Egg in 2007.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/B4UAWJDedfuQUF8GfzybxFLmxYyHST1UtF2Z8YMYnCGiuzzZbOuHSl7ahkPD8z74-kzBvpN49m7zIjvlQJfQgGbrU5n3l8YBQ5N8aF2DiHTM' alt='Fabergé’s Winter Egg, commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II as a 1913 Easter gift for his mother, on display at Christie’s in London ahead of the record-breaking auction.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Imperial commission: Tsar Nicholas II ordered the Winter Egg as a 1913 Easter gift for his mother, Empress Maria Feodorovna, continuing the Romanov tradition of presenting elaborate Fabergé eggs at Orthodox Easter.</li><li>Materials and design: The egg is fashioned from finely carved rock crystal, adorned with a delicate platinum snowflake pattern and set with around 4,500 miniature diamonds on its surface and stand.</li><li>Rarity of Imperial eggs: Fabergé produced only 50 Imperial Easter Eggs over 31 years for Russia’s ruling Romanov family, making surviving examples exceptionally scarce and highly coveted by museums and collectors.</li><li>Record-breaking history: The Winter Egg has now broken the auction price record for a Fabergé work three separate times across its sales history, underscoring its enduring status among collectors.</li><li>Previous benchmark piece: Before this sale, the highest auction price for a Fabergé egg was nearly £9 million for the non-Imperial Rothschild Egg sold in 2007 to a Russian collector, less than half of the new benchmark set by the Winter Egg.</li></ul><blockquote>Today’s result sets a new world auction record for a work by Faberge, reaffirming the enduring significance of this masterpiece. - Margo Oganesian</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Christie’s auction house: Christie’s characterized the Winter Egg as “one of the rarest items that you can find” and highlighted it as both a technical and artistic pinnacle in Fabergé’s Imperial series, underscoring why it attracted vigorous global bidding interest.
