Apple has teamed up with Japanese fashion house ISSEY MIYAKE to launch <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/11/introducing-iphone-pocket-a-beautiful-way-to-wear-and-carry-iphone/">iPhone Pocket</a>, a 3D-knitted limited edition accessory designed to carry an iPhone, AirPods, and other everyday items. <br/>

The accessory is like a stretchy pocket, not unlike an iPod Sock, but elongated to form a strap made of a ribbed, elastic textile that fully encloses an iPhone yet allows you to glimpse the display through its open structure. ISSEY MIYAKE's design director Yoshiyuki Miyamae said it is inspired by the concept of "a piece of cloth," and described it as exploring "the joy of wearing iPhone in your own way." (For what it's worth, the brand's founder designed Steve Jobs' iconic black mock-turtleneck.)<br/>

iPhone Pocket comes in two versions. There's a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/hs8q2zm/a/iphone-pocket-by-issey-miyake-short-mandarin">short strap design</a> available in eight colors for &#36;149.95, and a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/hs8k2zm/a/iphone-pocket-by-issey-miyake-long-black">long strap design</a> in three colors for &#36;229.95. The short strap comes in lemon, mandarin, purple, pink, peacock, sapphire, cinnamon, and black, while the long strap comes in sapphire, cinnamon, and black. Both lengths fit any iPhone model.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the color palette was created to mix and match with all iPhone models, and that the iPhone Pocket can be worn in a variety of ways – handheld, tied onto bags, or worn directly on the body.<br/>
<blockquote>"Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE share a design approach that celebrates craftsmanship, simplicity, and delight," said Molly Anderson, Apple's vice president of Industrial Design. "This clever extra pocket exemplifies those ideas and is a natural accompaniment to our products. The color palette of iPhone Pocket was intentionally designed to mix and match with all our iPhone models and colors — allowing users to create their own personalized combination. Its recognizable silhouette offers a beautiful new way to carry your iPhone, AirPods, and favorite everyday items."</blockquote><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/Apple-iPhone-Pocket-and-ISSEY-MIYAKE-hero.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2182" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026356" /><br/>
