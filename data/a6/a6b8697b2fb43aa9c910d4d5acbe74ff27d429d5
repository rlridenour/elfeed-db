<p>President Trump met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum in Washington on Friday, using the 2026 World Cup draw gala as an informal backdrop for new talks on North American trade rules. The White House confirmed the leaders held a private conversation after the event, and Canadian outlets reported that the three spoke for around 45 minutes without staff present, suggesting a candid exchange on contentious economic issues. According to reporting, the discussion touched on the future of the regional free trade framework at the end of a year marked by heightened tensions, public threats and harsh rhetoric from Washington over its partners’ trade practices. The meetings also marked the first in‑person encounter between Trump and Sheinbaum since both took office, while Carney has already visited the US capital twice since Trump’s return to the presidency, underlining Canada’s active diplomatic outreach. Even as detailed outcomes were not disclosed, the encounter showed that top North American leaders are still willing to sit down together and use shared events like the World Cup to keep dialogue open.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/3GjogfPMycQ0bMjEay9Bt3u2-cf_smWIMTfluXVbBya1EBVYRE0ZJBLBPQreooyUeq-dYDIDXBn3iUj_C7O7YmMvPQnCCg_lIB8s6wmVU-_rlfiOwY0NoOP018e6HW6cddZGW4iSQuQ-wPO9NFMDF-wL7boI5d-nKA6W9UOjDY8MYBmVv4zSjo1iirQuU63od2zGKnyA8RkoSFkOLzujIQBgdhEuwkmKcAkV0lCW8nckAJ1WqxvkuvCQ' alt='President Donald Trump speaks with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum after the 2026 World Cup draw at the Kennedy Center in Washington.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Soccer diplomacy: The 2026 World Cup draw at Washington’s Kennedy Center brought together Trump, Sheinbaum and Carney in a festive setting that temporarily sidelined recent cross‑border tensions in favor of a shared passion for football.</li><li>Sheinbaum’s debut: The visit to the World Cup gala was President Sheinbaum’s first trip to Washington since taking office, giving her an early chance to engage directly with Trump after months of sharp public exchanges between their governments.</li><li>Free trade focus: Sources described the talks as partly centered on the future of the North American free trade deal, indicating that leaders are exploring how to handle disputes and modernization of the pact despite recent frictions.</li><li>Carney’s role: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has already held two previous White House visits since Trump’s return to power, positioning Ottawa as an active mediator and steady interlocutor between Washington and Mexico City.</li><li>Tone shift: Coverage noted that, after a year described as the most strained since the 1990s free trade accord was signed, the leaders opted for a friendlier tone during the World Cup‑related events than the threats and insults that had characterized previous months.</li></ul><blockquote>Those squabbles—and Trump’s threats and insults—were momentarily set aside in the name of soccer - El País correspondent (describing the meeting atmosphere)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States government: The White House highlighted that President Trump held talks with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts after the World Cup draw but did not provide a detailed readout, signaling a preference for discreet leader‑level discussions at this stage.
