<p>Pope Leo XIV, the first U.S. pontiff, has begun a four-day visit to Turkey on his first trip abroad as leader of the Catholic Church, arriving in Ankara to a military honor guard before talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and a visit to the mausoleum of modern Turkey’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. He used his opening speeches to warn that an unusually high number of armed conflicts are threatening humanity and to urge Turkey to embrace its role as a mediator and bridge between East and West, citing Ankara’s efforts related to Gaza, Ukraine and other crises. The trip will take him to Istanbul and the ancient city of Iznik, where he will join Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I to mark the 1,700th anniversary of the early Church council that produced the Nicene Creed, and to meet Christian leaders from across the Middle East in a bid to encourage greater unity among long-divided denominations. Both the pope and Bartholomew have emphasized that Muslim‑majority Turkey should not be seen as hostile territory for Christians and have framed the visit as a message of fraternity, dialogue and peaceful coexistence for believers and non‑believers alike.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7cx_D3R-ZFtHY4P1v4p-l6xrZWq-87ZPKzYnAQpNU3DdOkhS7zWWf-OXiTeImie60mVY25YXJXxqmLxNvJTq9ep3N-HZIl9lfUC52VH-' alt='Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomes Pope Leo XIV at the Presidential Palace in Ankara during the pope’s first foreign trip.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Turkey’s mediator role: Pope Leo publicly highlighted Turkey’s “special role” as a regional stabilizer and potential mediator in current wars, encouraging Ankara to use its position between Europe and the Middle East to promote rapprochement among peoples involved in conflicts from Gaza to Ukraine.</li><li>Security and protocol: Authorities mounted a tight security operation in Ankara, sealing off streets as the papal motorcade traveled from the airport to Ataturk’s mausoleum and then to the presidential complex, where he received a formal welcome from Erdogan.</li><li>Message to Catholics: On the flight to Turkey, Leo told journalists he had “very much been looking forward to this trip” because of its significance for Christians worldwide and described it as a historic moment for his new papacy.</li><li>Orthodox perspective: Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, spiritual head of some 260 million Orthodox Christians, said it was simplistic to portray Turkey as hostile to Christians and rejected the idea that the papal visit meant taking sides in a religiously divided environment.</li><li>Middle East church leaders: During the visit the pope plans to sit down with Christian leaders from several Middle Eastern countries to encourage cooperation among communities that have often been divided for centuries, against the backdrop of regional instability and migration pressures on those churches.</li></ul><blockquote>Today more than ever, we need people who will promote dialogue and practises it, with firm will and patient resolve - Pope Leo XIV</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pope Leo XIV: Leo has framed the journey as a chance to encourage Turkey to be “a source of stability and rapprochement between peoples” and to call for dialogue instead of violence in a world he says faces an unusually high number of wars.
