The iOS 18.6, iPadOS 18.6, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.6 updates that Apple released today address dozens of vulnerabilities, according to Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100">security support documents</a>. None of the vulnerabilities are known to have been actively exploited in the wild, but it's still a good idea to install the new updates right away.<br/>
