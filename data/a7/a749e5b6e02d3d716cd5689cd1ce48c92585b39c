T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-satellite-data-ready-app-expansion">is expanding</a> its T-Satellite with Starlink service, adding satellite data connectivity to multiple popular apps. That means T-Mobile users who don't have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection will be able to use Starlink satellite connectivity to access supported apps.<br/>

Apps that will work over a T-Mobile satellite connection include Google Maps, AllTrails, AccuWeather, CalTopo, X, WhatsApp (texts, voice, and video chat), onX, and T-Life.<br/>
<br/>
Some native device apps like Google Messages, Find Hub, Pixel Weather, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, Apple Weather, and Apple Fitness were already able to be used with T-Mobile's U.S. satellite service.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile subscribers with access to T-Satellite will see the satellite connection kick in whenever cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity are unavailable. Apps will offer tailored, critical content instead of full data-heavy experiences.<br/>
<br/>
T-Satellite works on Apple's iPhones, and it can be used alongside the native satellite connectivity available in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14 and later. The satellite service is included in T-Mobile's Experience Beyond and Go5G Next plans, and T-Mobile customers with other plans can get access for &#36;10 per month. Smartphone users who do not have T-Mobile can subscribe to T-Satellite as a standalone service for &#36;10 per month.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/01/t-mobile-satellite-app-support/">T-Mobile&#039;s Satellite Service Now Works With Popular Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobiles-satellite-service-now-works-with-popular-apps.2468148/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
