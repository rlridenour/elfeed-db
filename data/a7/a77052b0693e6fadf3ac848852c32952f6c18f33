<p>Alice’s Restaurant.&nbsp;It’s now a Thanksgiving classic, and something of a tradition around here.&nbsp;Recorded in 1967, the 18+ minute counterculture song recounts Arlo Guthrie’s real encounter with the law, starting on Thanksgiving Day 1965. As the long song unfolds, we hear all about how a hippie-bating&nbsp;police officer, by the name of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/obituaries/william-j-obanhein-alice-s-restaurant-lawman-69.html">William “Obie” Obanhein</a>, arrested Arlo for littering. (Cultural footnote: Obie previously&nbsp;posed for several&nbsp;Norman Rockwell paintings, including the well-known painting,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.artchive.com/artchive/r/rockwell/rockwell_runaway.jpg">“The Runaway,”</a>&nbsp;that graced a <a href="http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2012/05/08/archives/a-fond-farewell-to-an-iconic-policeman.html">1958 cover of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2012/05/08/archives/a-fond-farewell-to-an-iconic-policeman.html">The Saturday Evening Post</a></em>.) In fairly short order,&nbsp;Arlo pleads guilty to a misdemeanor charge, pays a $25 fine, and cleans up the thrash. But the story isn’t over. Not by a long shot.</p>

<p>Later, when Arlo&nbsp;(son of Woody Guthrie) gets called up for the draft, the petty crime ironically becomes a basis for disqualifying him from military service in the Vietnam War. Guthrie recounts this with some bitterness as the song builds into a&nbsp;satirical protest against the war:&nbsp;“I’m sittin’ here on the Group W bench ’cause you want to know if I’m moral enough to join the Army, burn women, kids, houses and villages after bein’ a litterbug.” And then we’re back to the cheery chorus again: “You can get anything you want, at Alice’s Restaurant.”</p>
<p>We have featured Guthrie’s classic during past years. But, for this Thanksgiving, we give you the illustrated version.</p>
