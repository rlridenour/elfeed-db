Providing over 6,000 MB/s real-world speeds, the 1M2 approaches the performance level of an internal MacBook Pro drive, making it a compelling partner for Apple's latest M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro models, not to mention the M4 Pro Mac mini and the latest Mac Studio.<br/>
<br/>
The aluminum enclosure features a finned heatsink design that means no fans are required to maintain performance. Bus-powered through its included USB4 cable, the drive also works across multiple platforms including PCs, iPad Pro, Chromebooks, and Surface devices. <br/>
<br/>
OWC offers both DIY and ready-to-run configurations. Users can purchase the empty enclosure and install their own NVMe M.2 SSD, or select pre-built models. The design supports both 2280 and 2242 form factor drives, so future upgrades should be straightforward.<br/>
<br/>
The Express 1M2 80G maintains backward compatibility with Thunderbolt 3 and 4 systems, and starts at &#36;219 for the empty enclosure, with pre-configured models ranging from &#36;349 for 1TB to &#36;1,299 for 8TB. The drive is available to purchase now through the <a href="https://www.owc.com/solutions/express-1m2-80g">OWC website</a> and <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOWC-Portable-Thunderbolt-Compatible-Enclosure%2Fdp%2FB0FKPGF3BH%2F">Amazon</a>.<br/>
