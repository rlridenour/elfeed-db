<p>Iran has seen more than two weeks of nationwide protests that analysts describe as the most serious challenge in years to the country’s theocratic leadership. The unrest was initially driven by severe economic pain—highlighted by a sharp fall in the rial that disrupted commerce—before many demonstrations broadened into calls for sweeping political change. Reporting describes a violent crackdown by security forces, with large reported death tolls and mass arrests. U.S. involvement has become a central issue: President Donald Trump has said the United States would intervene on behalf of protesters, while the White House said he is willing to use military force; Iranian officials, meanwhile, have said they have the situation under control.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/MJpIs5VioJp1-Qmf6RCG3kNvl-HS9azz8jz56QEoklt8KA1tvu_kueCHPuLRjAv-99ZGTlDhN_hp0GBC-oxNJ7nXNk1l4jF2TJ2Ip--os5jmce9IPBuTypMlARZ8cj15XenFv7h-9nKVIi_9QUE-woSfQ5ruld_aB1eVH8oxE3-c8ex0kNmLMljvTQ2wxP-zHak3a0uL2AtDpQ68e3lo3kuZzq6UGHYR9E8zjsidhiW01vLiTSdG7hxKXml55bcDDLbYlQ' alt='Photo from coverage of Iran’s economy-linked protests.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Economic trigger: Time reports the rial fell to 1.48 million per U.S. dollar on Dec. 28, sparking bazaar protests by merchants who said business had become impossible.</li><li>Sanctions context: Analysts cited by Time link the economic collapse’s acceleration to the UN reimposing sanctions in September over Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons.</li><li>Nationwide spread: Within about a week, demonstrations spread across all 31 provinces, according to Time’s account of the unrest’s pace and reach.</li><li>Civil-rights anger: Time notes protests also reflect long-standing anger at state-enforced social restrictions, including dress and personal-behavior rules, and references nationwide unrest in 2022 after a young woman died in custody.</li><li>Dueling claims: Iran’s foreign minister said protests were “under total control,” while the White House described President Trump as “unafraid to use military force on Iran,” The Guardian reports.</li></ul><blockquote>Unafraid to use military force on Iran - White House (spokesperson not specified in briefing)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iranian protesters (as described by analysts/reporting): Demonstrations have shifted from economic grievances to demands for wholesale political change away from the clerical system, reflecting hardened public opinion against the state.
