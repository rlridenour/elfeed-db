<p>&#8220;The paradox is that the more analytic philosophy became dominant in the universities, the more it became removed from the concerns of the average person with philosophical interests.&#8221;<span id="more-55346"></span></p>
<p>And &#8220;it has had little impact on the general culture and on other parts of the academy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crane&#8217;s conception of analytic philosophy is somewhat historical (a la <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/georgetown.edu/prof-william-blattner/continental-analytic-philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Blattner</a>; see <a href="https://dailynous.com/2019/09/05/collingwood-contintental-analytic-divide/">this</a>, too) and <a href="https://dailynous.com/tag/externalist-history-of-philosophy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">externalist</a>&#8212;what he calls a &#8220;deflationary&#8221; account of it. Correspondingly, the story of its &#8220;institutional success,&#8221; he says, &#8220;must be largely historical, rather than philosophical.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not entirely deflationary, for those historical and contingent forces contributed to &#8220;the way analytic philosophy has developed its own distinctive way of thinking&#8221; and its &#8220;institutional success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crane thinks that overcoming analytic philosophy&#8217;s cultural isolation must involve analytic philosophers recognizing that they&#8217;ve been a part of&#8212;and hence influenced by&#8212;the broader culture all along, including broader conceptions of philosophy:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>If philosophers are to seriously address the hostility and incomprehension that they encounter, they need to start with a plausible account of their own intellectual discipline. They may tell themselves that philosophy is a technical subject-matter, with its own techniques and high standards, and in a way this is correct. But they also need to tell a story about how philosophy in this sense relates to many other things that the world has counted as philosophy.  </em></p>
<p>Schuringa&#8217;s book, Crane says, is one such story, &#8220;a serious attempt to understand why analytic philosophy confronts certain problems and questions and ignores others&#8212;where these questions come from and which contingent intellectual circumstances led to those becoming the dominant questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Analytic philosophers need to do more of this kind of work, Crane thinks, in part because it will help them better understand their own tradition, which is crucial for them getting others to see the value in their type of philosophy:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>[I]f analytic philosophers were to reflect in a more disinterested, less defensive way about their tradition, it could help them understand why philosophers of other traditions find it so obscure, and why those outside philosophy can find it so pointless&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>To convey to those on the outside why these questions [that analytic philosophers take up] matter, though, is no easy task. Analytic philosophers would need to develop both a historical sense and a better way of talking to those whom they see as “non-professionals”&#8230; [A]nalytic philosophers&#8230; have not done a good job of explaining to their critics the importance or interest of the particular problems that preoccupy them. It would be a first step in improving this situation if they could first explain these things to themselves. </em></p>
<p>This is an interesting conjecture, and I&#8217;m curious whether it is true. Will historicizing analytic philosophy actually lead critics and the disinterested to see its &#8220;importance or interest&#8221;? Are there examples of that happening?</p>
<p>One might think that such historicization would tend to have the opposite effect, that it would undercut the perceived value of analytic philosophy&#8217;s inquiries by emphasizing the arational influences on its choice of methods and subjects. Indeed, that externalist histories of analytic philosophy can be intellectually humbling for the discipline is one reason to encourage more of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps the <a href="https://dailynous.com/2022/10/25/why-the-history-of-philosophy-matters-to-philosophy-guest-post/">history of philosophy</a> can provide useful perspective here. We tend not to think less of the greats of the history of philosophy now that scholars have pointed out to us all of the social, political, institutional, and personal contingencies that played a role in them thinking about and writing what they did.</p>
<p>Analytic philosophers might nonetheless balk. We tend to understand our work in terms of justification, not causation. But perhaps this, too, is a prejudice, ingrained in us by various contingencies.</p>
<p>After all, the genetic fallacy is a fallacy no matter what led us to believe so.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/10/17/the-paradox-of-analytic-philosophys-success/">The Paradox of Analytic Philosophy’s Success</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
