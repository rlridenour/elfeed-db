<p>Paul Lukas, founder of Uni Watch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Due to a perfect storm of negative developments, I have
reluctantly come to the unfortunate conclusion that continuing to
publish Uni Watch is no longer viable. This will be the site’s
final post.</p>

<p>Yes, I’m serious. And no, this isn’t a Halloween-related prank.
Uni Watch is shutting down, for real.</p>

<p>I realize this news probably comes as a shock and that you no
doubt have lots of questions, so let’s shift into Q&amp;A mode. [...]</p>

<p><em>Will the site’s archive remain on the web?</em></p>

<p>No, unfortunately. Most of the archive — everything but the past
few days’ worth of content — has already been taken down. The
rest of the site, including this post, will be taken offline soon,
probably around next Wednesday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>26 years is a hell of a run (dating back to 1999, a few years before Uni Watch became a standalone site), but I don’t understand why sites don’t leave their archives standing when they close down. It shouldn’t cost much to keep the domain name registered and a static version of the site’s archive online.</p>

<p>Uni Watch, to me, epitomized a certain mindset from the early web. To wit, that there ought to be a blog (or two or three) <em>dedicated</em> to every esoteric interest under the sun. You want to obsess about sports team uniform designs? Uni Watch was there. For a good long stretch, there seemingly <em>was</em> a blog (or two or three) dedicated to just about everything. That’s starting to wane. New sites aren’t rising to take the place of retiring ones.</p>
