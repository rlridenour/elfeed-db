Apple is rumored to be planning a redesigned iPhone model for release in 2027, to mark the 20th anniversary of the device's launch. However, a source with a proven track record has now cast doubt on the device featuring an all-screen design.<br/>

In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter last month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-design/">planning a 20th-anniversary iPhone</a> model "without any cutouts in the display." He <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/08/ios-26-liquid-glass-20th-anniversary-iphone/">later added</a> that the device would have "extraordinarily slim bezels" around the screen, along with "curved glass sides around the entire phone, even at the edges."<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1937015059806609548">post on X today</a>, however, Counterpoint Research VP Ross Young revised his expectations for future iPhone displays. He now believes that the first iPhone with both under-screen Face ID and an under-screen front camera will be released all the way in 2030, suggesting that a truly all-screen iPhone remains a full five years away.<br/>
<br/>
At one point, Young expected an iPhone with under-screen Face ID and an under-screen front camera to launch <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1642942985976578049">as early as 2027</a>, so his current expectation of 2030 is disappointing news for Apple fans, if accurate. At the same time, it is not too shocking, as an all-screen iPhone is one of those rumors that seems to get pushed back over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman and Young both have very good track records with Apple rumors, but their timelines for an all-screen iPhone now differ, so we will have to wait and see if Gurman responds. If we go by the latest word from Young, though, the 20th-anniversary iPhone might not be the ambitious, all-screen model that Apple fans have long dreamed of.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman and Young have shared conflicting information in the past. In February 2024, Young was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled-for-now/">first to report</a> that the rumored micro-LED Apple Watch Ultra was canceled. In a since-deleted post on X, Gurman responded by telling Young that he was looking forward to wearing his micro-LED Apple Watch in a few more years. A few weeks later, Gurman relented and reported that the micro-LED Apple Watch project <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-ends-microled-apple-watch-development/">had been canceled</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/20th-anniversary-iphone/">20th-Anniversary iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/">Ross Young</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-disputed/">20th-Anniversary iPhone May Not Feature an All-Screen Design After All</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/20th-anniversary-iphone-may-not-feature-an-all-screen-design-after-all.2459508/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
