<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/23/apple-announces-applecare-one/">AppleCare One</a> is Apple's new subscription for customers to cover multiple devices with a single plan. It starts at &#36;19.99 per month for up to three products, with the ability to add more for &#36;5.99 per month for each additional device. The plan incudes all of the benefits that come with &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+, such as unlimited repairs for accidents, priority support, battery coverage, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Subscribers can freely move their devices in and out of the plan at any time. &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; One also enables users to add products they already own that are up to four years old, providing they are in good condition, extending beyond the current 60-day window to purchase &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+. When a customer trades in a covered product with Apple, it is automatically removed from their &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; One plan and replaced with the new device. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; One also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/23/applecare-with-theft-loss-for-ipad-apple-watch/">expands theft and loss protection</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Apple Watch. Previously, it was only available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; One's pricing is the same regardless of the products that are covered. Apple says that a customer who enrolls their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and Apple Watch could save up to &#36;11 per month versus enrolling in separate &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+ plans for each device. <br/>
<br/>
Customers in the United States can now sign up for <a href="https://www.apple.com/applecare/">AppleCare One</a> on their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, or Mac, or by visiting an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We also discuss the news that automakers including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/24/bmw-confirms-no-plans-to-offer-carplay-ultra/">BMW</a>, Mercedes, Audi, Volvo, Polestar, Renault, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/">General Motors</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/25/car-brands-reneged-on-apple-carplay-ultra/">will not support</a> &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Ultra. It seems to be a major retreat from Apple's 2022 announcement, which originally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/carplay-ultra-automakers/">named 14 automakers</a> as future &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Ultra partners.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Ultra goes far beyond traditional &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; by taking control of the entire dashboard experience. The system displays vehicle information like temperature, speed, and fuel levels alongside &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps, creating what Apple calls "a unified and consistent experience across all the driver's screens."<br/>
<br/>
Currently, only <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/first-look-at-carplay-ultra/">Aston Martin offers CarPlay Ultra</a> in production vehicles. Hyundai and its Kia and Genesis cars remain committed partners, while Porsche plans future support. Other originally announced brands like Ford and Nissan have provided no updates on their &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Ultra plans.<br/>
