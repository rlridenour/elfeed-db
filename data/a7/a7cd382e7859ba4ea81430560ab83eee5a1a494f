Dye&rsquo;s departure was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-03/apple-design-executive-alan-dye-poached-by-meta-in-major-coup" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed by Apple to Bloomberg</a>, with Apple CEO Tim Cook telling the publication that Steve Lemay will take over Dye&rsquo;s role:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  Steve Lemay has played a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999. He has always set an extraordinarily high bar for excellence and embodies Apple&rsquo;s culture of collaboration and creativity.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p4">Dye, who led the rollout of Apple&rsquo;s Liquid Glass design language across all of its OSes, will be in charge of hardware, software, and AI across Meta&rsquo;s product lines. Billy Sorrentino, who worked with Dye, is also leaving Apple&rsquo;s design group for Meta.</p>
<p id="p5">Dye&rsquo;s departure comes at an interesting moment for Apple and Meta. Meta, which has seen some success with its Ray-Ban smart glasses, has struggled with other consumer product projects but clearly wants to do more with AI-infused hardware. Meanwhile, Apple has had trouble infusing its software and hardware lineup with AI and has experienced a rash of departures among its AI team and retirements within its executive ranks. 2026 is shaping up to be a year of change across much of Apple.</p>
