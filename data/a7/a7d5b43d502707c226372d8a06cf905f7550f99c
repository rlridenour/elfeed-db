<blockquote>
  <p>Meta has laid off an unspecified number of employees in its
Reality Labs division, a company spokesperson confirmed. The cuts
affected teams working in Oculus Studios, Meta’s in-house games
division for Quest headsets, as well as some employees involved in
the company’s hardware efforts, according to people familiar with
the matter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/meta-lays-off-more-than-100-staff-across-reality-labs-unit?embedded-checkout=true">According to Bloomberg</a> it was “more than 100”.</p>

<p>I’m so old <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-company-name-to-meta.html">I remember</a> when Facebook renamed itself Meta because the “metaverse” was supposedly the future of the company and, so said Mark Zuckerberg, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/11/03/zuckerberg-facebook-metaverse-meta-virtual-reality-oculus/">the future of computing itself</a>. Now, when Zuck goes on Joe Rogan’s podcast and chats for three hours, the metaverse thing doesn’t come up once, <a href="https://www.happyscribe.com/public/the-joe-rogan-experience/2255-mark-zuckerberg">not even once</a>, even in passing.</p>

<p>It’s enough to <a href="https://www.threads.com/@anildash/post/DE0zWfqMdEn">make one suspect</a> Zuck isn’t a straight shooter.</p>
