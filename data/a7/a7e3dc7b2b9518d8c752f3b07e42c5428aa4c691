<p>A late-night fire at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in the resort village of Arpora in India’s Goa state killed at least 25 people and injured several others shortly after midnight local time, according to state officials and police. Many of those who died were staff working in the basement and kitchen areas, while a smaller number were domestic and foreign tourists who had come to the busy weekend party venue. Authorities say the blaze began during a planned indoor &quot;fire show&quot; and was likely fueled as flames spread through wooden structures, sending thick smoke through the multi-level building and causing suffocation. Goa’s chief minister has ordered a magisterial inquiry, police have opened a criminal investigation into possible safety violations at the club, and officials plan broader fire-safety audits of similar venues in the coastal state.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fwkoyWYEAxb28wkPbqIpJFswhgBpITfcb0GlhzkxFhet_8gQyXYPVeb-x3Wf7jcTsgUPph5n32KK6z36Vk4JLY22yXncy5cBaPxl_2Cr7zk9' alt='The burned remains of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, which has been sealed for investigation after a deadly fire in Goa, India, on 7 December 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Suspected ignition: Goa’s fire chief said the incident began when a fire performance inside the club ignited wooden décor, leading to rapid smoke spread through the building.</li><li>Structural concerns: A local village council official said the nightclub had previously received a demolition notice for lacking proper construction permits, but the order was later withdrawn by higher authorities.</li><li>Victim breakdown: State officials reported that the dead included at least 14 workers and four tourists, while additional employees and guests were hospitalized with burn injuries and smoke inhalation.</li><li>Government support: India’s prime minister announced federal compensation payments for families of the deceased and for those injured, in addition to assistance from the Goa state government.</li><li>Safety crackdown: Goa authorities said they will conduct fresh inspections and fire-safety audits across bars, clubs, and restaurants in tourist areas to prevent similar tragedies.</li></ul><blockquote>Today is a very painful day for all of us - Pramod Sawant</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Goa state government: The chief minister described the day as painful, announced an official inquiry to determine the cause and responsibility, and promised state compensation for victims’ families.
