</ul><h1>Not Fun</h1><p>So, the utility of one of these things is unquestionable.</p>
<p>Hey, are you a little hot? No problem! It has a fan.</p>
<p>Hey, need some light to see? No problem! It has a little light on it.</p>
<p>Hey, is your phone running low on power? No problem! It’s also a power bank.</p>
<p>What is also unquestionable is that these things are no fun. In each of the above paragraphs, we said, “No problem!” But the truth is, if you need this thing’s three functions all at once, that means you’re hot, you’re in the dark, and your phone is dying.</p>
<p>Which is a problem.</p>
<p>Like, maybe your car’s broken on the side of the road on one of those hot summer nights when the sun goes down but the temperature doesn’t. So you’re in the dark trying to read your manual by moonlight, sweating like crazy, until you decide: fuck it, you’re calling a tow truck. Which, unsurprisingly, is going to take forever to get there. And sure, you can entertain yourself with your phone, but what if its battery starts to die? And what if you need to make a call for help?</p>
<p>Or, maybe there’s a power outage in the summer. Sure, you need a little more light than this thing can provide probably (so it’s good you bought all those lanterns from us; you can never have too many, right?!?!) and sure you probably want a bit more juice too (so it’s a good thing you bought one of those big battery things we sold). But maybe, when it gets dark and the kids are in bed, you just need a little alone time away from your family with a light, a little power for your phone, and a soft breeze.</p>
<p>Or, maybe you’re camping.</p>
<p>Our point is: these three scenarios sound like hell. But they’ll <em>feel</em> a smidge less like hell if you’ve got these.</p>
<p>And yet, once again, ‘a little less hellish’ is not exactly a <em>fun</em> pitch.</p>
<p>So please, if you have any suggestions for how these could be put to use in a fun way, do let us know in the comments.</p>
<p>Otherwise, buy them. They’re pretty useful.</p>
