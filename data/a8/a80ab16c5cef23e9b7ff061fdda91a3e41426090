<p>Because apparently I’m just doing “<a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2025/03/how-make3-built-severances-woemeter/">fun <em>Severance</em> tidbits</a>” now, here’s <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/why-mark-in-severance-drives-a-1997-volvo-and-more-answers-from-the-shows-car-coordinators">a piece by Nico DeMattia at The Drive</a> about something I’d found myself wondering while watching the show: why are all the cars on <em>Severance</em> old?</p>
<p>The piece is less about in-show canon than it is about the production: why they chose certain models and how they went about actually sourcing them. It’s interesting stuff if you enjoy behind-the-scenes stuff, and once again demonstrates how much thought and care goes into everything you see on the show.</p>
