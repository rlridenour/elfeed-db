<p>Nigerian authorities have secured the release of 100 children who were abducted by gunmen in late November from St Mary’s co-educational Catholic boarding school in Niger state, one of several mass school kidnappings that have hit the country in recent years. Local broadcaster Channels Television and a United Nations source said the group, made up of schoolchildren, is expected to be handed over to local government officials in Niger state, with some reports indicating the handover is planned for Monday, December 9. The students were taken along with staff when armed attackers stormed the rural school in Papiri village, Agwara local government area, highlighting persistent insecurity in north-central Nigeria where armed groups frequently kidnap for ransom. Officials and UN sources say more than 160 other students and staff are still believed to be in captivity, and authorities have not yet provided details on their condition or on any ongoing rescue or negotiation efforts. Even as families celebrate the imminent reunions with the freed children, the incident underlines the continuing challenge for Nigeria’s federal and state governments as they seek to protect schools and prevent further mass abductions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qXM8K_hv6UXEDh6eHrzwYcqQEcyL_sMANs9X6vCmi_lCTDCSDrAvzCiJCupddxCfaYkC1AKhu8YVQxG5eWguOoeD4B3N9pzUI6qdJ5XlDZgMlak1rVkYBs8yWIuTKl4S-pf2TYqqicsR5SVHCQzBde3wYI2fvLdw4_TOTcgJp0E9pAW1RDox1LWq3w9bHnX4-c59lTxphDF0z3_gA4NLC6br31L2OjtY381huytnABC4ZzENbI1bZGBX-jQ8VClcgjH9hePEJxWkEJROq5kaVALy' alt='A student walks through St Mary’s School in Niger state days after the mass abduction, as the community awaits the return of freed pupils.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of abduction: Gunmen seized a total of 315 people, including pupils and staff, when they raided St Mary’s co-educational Catholic boarding school in late November, making it one of the country’s larger recent school kidnappings.</li><li>Remaining hostages: Reports from UN and media sources indicate that more than 160 individuals, including at least 153 students and a dozen teachers, are still being held by the abductors, with their whereabouts and health unknown.</li><li>Location and community: The school is located in Papiri, a community in Agwara local government area of Niger state in north-central Nigeria, where residents have faced repeated attacks by armed groups in recent months.</li><li>Pattern of mass kidnappings: The incident forms part of a broader wave of mass abductions at schools across northern and central Nigeria in recent years, echoing high-profile cases like the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping in 2014 and putting renewed pressure on security services.</li><li>Planned handover process: According to a United Nations source cited by multiple outlets, the freed group will first be received by local officials in Niger state before any medical checks or reunions with families are arranged, though the exact procedures and timing have not been fully disclosed.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Niger state authorities: State officials, cited through local media and UN channels, have emphasized that they worked with federal security agencies and community leaders to secure the children’s release, while declining to give operational details or confirm whether any ransom was paid.
