With the Apple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3, Apple announced support for a new Sleep Score feature that's designed to provide you with an actionable overview of your sleep quality. <br/>

It turns out that Sleep Score is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a> feature, so it is also available on older Apple Watch models. If you have the &zwnj;watchOS 26&zwnj; release candidate installed, you can see your Sleep Score in the Health app already.<br/>
<br/>
Open up the Health app, choose the Sleep category from the Search interface, and tap on Sleep Score to see your personalized readout. <br/>
<br/>
Apple will rate your sleep as Excellent, High, OK, Low, or Very Low. Scores are calculated based on sleep duration, the time you went to bed, and how many times your sleep was interrupted during the night. Duration is worth 50 points, bedtime is worth 30 points, and interruptions is worth 20 points. Points are deducted for low sleep times, a late bedtime, or multiple sleep interruptions. <br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, an "Excellent" score means that your body and mind have received the rest and restorative sleep needed for the day. High means you got the sleep you need, even though you might not have slept perfectly. OK means you probably didn't get all the sleep you need, while Low means that you didn't get enough time to rest and restore. Very Low means you didn't get enough sleep and your rest level was low enough that it can have a mental and physical impact over time. <br/>
<br/>
Sleep Score is calculated from sleep data collected by the Apple Watch during sleep, or from a third-party device that reports results to the Health app. You technically don't need an Apple Watch to get a Sleep Score, but you do need some kind of device that records sleep and logs the results in the Health app. <br/>

&zwnj;watchOS 26&zwnj; with the Sleep Score, Liquid Glass, and other features will launch to the public on Monday, September 15. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/10/watchos-26-sleep-score/">You Don&#039;t Need the Apple Watch Series 11 to Get Your Sleep Score</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-dont-need-the-apple-watch-series-11-to-get-your-sleep-score.2465232/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
