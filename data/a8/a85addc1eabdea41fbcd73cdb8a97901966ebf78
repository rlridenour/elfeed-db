<p>In the latest turmoil inside Britain’s governing Labour Party, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has again rejected calls to resign over his decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as the UK’s ambassador to the United States — an appointment under renewed scrutiny because of Mandelson’s past links to the late Jeffrey Epstein. The row escalated Monday when Anas Sarwar, leader of Scottish Labour, publicly urged Starmer to step aside, and two senior Downing Street aides resigned in quick succession, sharpening questions about the government’s judgment and stability. On Tuesday, Starmer told ministers his government was “strong and united” and said he would not “walk away,” as allies moved to close ranks and head off an immediate leadership challenge. Several outlets say he has bought short-term breathing space but remains politically weakened, with attention also turning to possible successors if pressure builds again.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eEbTGJsinzmDrDsey8QQPhG9JT0JVVDKqPHb6WxhUr7rc1cQ_eFvp3LmgEFoCWV9N4UTc_ofemdy57eaOz3Cr79eJmrGb7zqXeA5WT7tzg2cGd-ptmxKklh9OwyxqUWPMm69B3thc_yeepQGDAkA7lNaFMPvR0nqgi4L4Z8Itll3AfMXqJ_8jOYz-PW0WLS4ZJKMuTKeWfIlnSiVE9PgnSbiEmFdgdAdgD8' alt='UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amid leadership pressure over his US envoy appointment.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Aides resign: Downing Street communications chief Tim Allan said he would quit to make way for a new team to support the prime minister, a day after Starmer’s closest aide Morgan McSweeney stepped down — resignations seen as part of the fallout from the Mandelson appointment.</li><li>Sarwar’s warning: At a news conference in Glasgow, Sarwar said it was “with a heavy heart” that he concluded “the distraction needs to end and the leadership in Downing Street has to change.” He added there had been “too many mistakes,” as Scottish Labour sources debated the timing and risks of his intervention.</li><li>Allies rally: Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said Labour lawmakers agreed to unite behind Starmer.
