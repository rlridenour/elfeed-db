<p>I started an Org mode document today. I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-x C-e # default</code> to
add a default set of options, title, date, author, and email. While I
like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#+DATE</code>, I <em>don’t</em> like that I forget to update it as I update
the rest of the file, likely at a later date. I said to myself “Oh,
there must be a way to do this automatically.”</p>

<p>I asked Google search, and the AI Overview pointed me to the Emacs
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">time-stamp</code> package. Doing a bit of research in the Emacs info pages
showed me that the rest of Google’s answer was actually pretty good.
One thing it assumes is that I want the same configuration everywhere
for this. No, I don’t. I only want this in some files, and even only
in some Org files. “Section 20.3.6.2 Forcing Time Stamps for One File”
on the Emacs info shows a nice way to use file local variables to
accomplish what I want. Here’s what I ended up with.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-org" data-lang="org"># Local Variables:
# time-stamp-start: "^#\\+date: "
# time-stamp-end: "$"
# time-stamp-format: "&lt;%Y-%02m-%02d %a&gt;"
# eval: (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'time-stamp nil t)
# End:</code></pre></figure>

<p>I verified it works by changing my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#+date</code> to something else, and
when I saved the file, it changed it to my preferred format.</p>
