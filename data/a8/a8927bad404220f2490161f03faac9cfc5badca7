<p>There are a lot of events in email messages that have always been easy to get into Fantastical (or any other calendar app) because they include an ICS file attachment. Like when I book a flight — I always get an email with an ICS attachment containing the flight details, and I just open that in Fantastical to import it. Forwarding that email to Fantastical would take longer than just opening the attachment. But what about a casual email from a friend or family member that doesn’t come with an attachment?</p>

<p>Here’s an example email I sent to myself from a sort of burner account I have for testing and for doing things like this.</p>

<pre><code>From: Heywood Floyd &lt;heywood••••••••@icloud.com&gt;  
Subject: Party for Hal on Saturday  
Date: June 3, 2025 at 1:22:45 PM EDT  
To: John Gruber &lt;••••••••@daringfireball.net&gt;  

Party at my house is on this Saturday, 12-3 or so.
You don’t have to bring anything.
</code></pre>

<p>That was the entire email, which I deliberately wrote in a very casual way (e.g. “this Saturday” instead of an actual date, and “12-3” as the time, without an explicit “pm”). Forwarded to Fantastical’s new event detection address, well under a minute later I got the following suggested event notification from Fantastical on my Mac:</p>

<pre><code>Title: Party for Hal at Heywood Floyd's house  
Location: Heywood Floyd's house  
Date: 7 June 2025, 12:00pm – 3:00pm  
Note: "You don't have to bring anything."
</code></pre>

<p>Also included in the Note field was a link to the original message in Mail.</p>

<p>In Apple Mail, Siri also suggested an event from the original email. After clicking “Add”, that event had the following details:</p>

<pre><code>Title: Party with Floyd  
Location: «empty»  
Date: 7 June 2025, 12:00pm – 3:00pm  
Note: «empty»
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing in Siri’s auto-detected event was wrong. Both got the date and time right. Siri’s title is fine — in real life, I’d know what that meant. But Fantastical’s title is perfect — it’s a party <em>for</em> Hal, <em>at</em> Heywood’s house. And Siri doesn’t include anything in the Note field, not even a link back to the original message, so it would be up to my own memory to remember where the party was.</p>

<p>To be clear, Fantastical doesn’t just add these events to your calendar. It shows them as suggestions, and there’s a “Preview” button in addition to “Add”. I’ll still preview before adding, but using this service does seem like a decent timesaver for creating new events from casual emails.</p>
