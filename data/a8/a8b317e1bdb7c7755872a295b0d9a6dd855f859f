Apple last week added iPad Air models with the M2 chip to its <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/ipad/ipad-air">refurbished store in the UK</a>, for the first time since the device was released in May 2024.<br/>

As usual, the refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15% to 20% compared to Apple's original pricing for the equivalent brand-new models. For example, the 13-inch iPad Air with the M2 chip, 128GB of storage, and Wi-Fi only is <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/FV273ZN/A/Refurbished-13-inch-iPad-Air-M2-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray">currently available for £639</a>, compared to £799 when it was first released last year.<br/>
<br/>
For now, availability is limited to the UK, but inventory should expand to the U.S. and other countries over the next several weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its refurbished iPads include a new battery and outer shell, a new white box, and all manuals and accessories, including a USB-C charging cable. Apple says it puts refurbished devices through a "thorough cleaning process and inspection," and it performs full functionality testing to ensure that no defective units are sold.<br/>
<br/>
All refurbished iPads are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and 14-day return policy, and AppleCare+ coverage is available.<br/>
<br/>
While some savings can be had here, better <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-deals/">iPad deals are often available through Amazon</a>.<br/>
