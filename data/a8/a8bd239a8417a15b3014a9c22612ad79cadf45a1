While the Vimeo app was missing from the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, Vimeo users had to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> from the Vimeo app on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> to watch videos on a bigger display.
