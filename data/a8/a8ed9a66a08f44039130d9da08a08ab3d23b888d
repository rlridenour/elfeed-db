<p>President Trump signed an executive order ending U.S. support for 66 international organizations, including 31 linked to the United Nations, saying they conflict with U.S. national interests, security, economic prosperity, or sovereignty. The list includes climate- and environment-focused bodies and the U.N. treaty framework that underpins global climate negotiations, drawing concern from diplomats and climate experts about reduced multilateral cooperation. The United Nations said it had not received formal notification and emphasized that many U.S. payments are assessed (mandatory), as the U.S. is the largest contributor to the UN regular budget.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/9MsptDLu4kZbONVtoa849-0i-A9qOfp8rQCrnZPeyFDobwj2HHwr6c5-u1MctTtQeHb9rXvcrdGiXnwrkf1BgbcC4cux50NPqy1_EBL_1s8kItkR2wMkUCfz22GjYVV-a2XWxVq4N4M28pNaIlskQsj6EzF9g34XZDc-XULaWcsjjv90p0dDGY5oiOTsaxdqbpL4hs54l7VZyo_U8RQbZqevr3O-JwByJmxCuOu2zRjZgCXi8HqGM2sKPA' alt='President Donald Trump signs an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from dozens of international organisations.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Mandatory dues: UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said assessed contributions are a legal obligation under the UN Charter, and the UN put U.S. arrears at about $1.5 billion after no regular-budget payment last year.</li><li>Budget context: Dujarric noted the UN regular budget for 2026 is $3.45 billion, covering political, humanitarian, disarmament, economic and social affairs, and communications work.</li><li>Treaty mechanics: UN officials said withdrawals from treaty-based organizations on the list would require formal letters, and the UN will continue implementing mandates approved by member states.</li><li>Climate outlier: Climate-policy specialists quoted by Time said leaving the UNFCCC sends a negative signal internationally and could leave the U.S. further behind countries positioning themselves around clean-energy growth.</li><li>Scope of exits: The withdrawal list includes bodies tied to gender equality and women’s empowerment alongside climate-related entities, according to reporting on the executive order and the organizations named.</li></ul><blockquote>Assessed contributions to the United Nations regular budget and peacekeeping budget, as approved by the General Assembly, are a legal obligation under the UN Charter for all member states, including the United States - Stéphane Dujarric</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House / President Trump: The administration says the targeted entities operate contrary to U.S. national interests, security, economic prosperity, or sovereignty.
