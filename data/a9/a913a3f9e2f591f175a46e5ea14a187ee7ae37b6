<p>Occasionally, by coincidence, the gaps between words on a page of printed text will become aligned, producing &#8220;rivers&#8221; of white space that descend across multiple lines. These occur most commonly when the font is monospaced and justification is full. Because they&#8217;re distracting, these artifacts are generally discouraged; typographers sometimes view a printed page upside down in order to spot them.</p>
<p>In ordinary text long rivers are unlikely, but in 1988 Mark Isaak <a href="https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3337&#038;context=wordways">found</a> the 12-line example above on <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mE6BFXd6ppsC&#038;pg=PA277">page 277</a> of the Harvard Classics edition of Darwin&#8217;s <em>The Voyage of the Beagle</em> (squint to see it).</p>
<p>Fritzi Striebel offered a small collection of unusual rivers at the end of <a href="https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3118&#038;context=wordways">this article</a> in the <a href="https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/vol19/iss2/">May 1986 issue</a> of <a href="https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/"><em>Word Ways</em></a>.</p>
