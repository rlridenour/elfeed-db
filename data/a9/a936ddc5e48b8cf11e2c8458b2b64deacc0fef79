Apple first introduced iPhone 15 models in Europe back in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/apple-begins-selling-refurb-iphone-15-europe/">January</a>, while the models were added to Apple's refurb stores in the U.S. and Canada <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/refurbished-iphone-15-us-store/">this week</a>. Archived webpage snapshots indicate the iPhone 15 models were added to the regional UK online store sometime around late April.<br/>

Apple's refurbished iPhones are unlocked, meaning they work with any carrier. Each device comes with a brand-new battery, a fresh outer shell, and a new USB-C cable—making them virtually indistinguishable from brand-new models. Refurbished iPhones also include Apple's standard one-year warranty, with the option to add AppleCare+ for extended coverage.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/07/refurbished-iphone-15-models-apple-online-store-uk/">Refurb iPhone 15 Models Now Available From Apple&#039;s UK Online Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/refurb-iphone-15-models-now-available-from-apples-uk-online-store.2456650/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
