<p>A well-known Emacs performance optimization advice is to boost the garbage collector
threshold (so GC collections happen less frequently). That’s something I’ve had in
my Emacs config for ages:</p>

<div class="language-emacs-lisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; reduce the frequency of garbage collection by making it happen on</span>
<span class="c1">;; each 50MB of allocated data (the default is on every 0.76MB)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">gc-cons-threshold</span> <span class="mi">50000000</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Probably I should increase it to 100MB+ these days, given the proliferation of more resource-hungry
tooling (e.g. LSP). On the other hand there are also some counter arguments to consider
when it comes to setting a high GC threshold:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The GC threshold setting after init is too high, IMNSHO, and its value seems arbitrary.</p>

  <p>If the OP thinks that Emacs will GC as soon as it allocates 100 MiB, then
that’s a grave mistake! What really happens is the first time Emacs considers
doing GC, if at that time more than 100 MiB have been allocated for Lisp
objects, Emacs will GC. And since neither Lisp programs nor the user have any
control on how soon Emacs will decide to check whether GC is needed, the
actual amount of memory by the time Emacs checks could be many times the value
of the threshold.</p>

  <p>My advice is to spend some time measuring the effect of increased GC threshold
on operations that you care about and that take a long enough time to annoy,
and use the lowest threshold value which produces a tangible
improvement. Start with the default value, then enlarge it by a factor of 2
until you see only insignificant speedups. I would not expect the value you
arrive at to be as high as 100 MiB.</p>

<p>One thing that’s not so common knowledge is that removing the GC limits during Emacs startup
might improve the speedup quite a lot (the actual results will be highly dependent on your setup).
Here’s what you need to do - just add the following bit to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">early-init.el</code>:</p>

<div class="language-emacs-lisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; Temporarily increase GC threshold during startup</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">gc-cons-threshold</span> <span class="nv">most-positive-fixnum</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">;; Restore to normal value after startup (e.g. 50MB)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'emacs-startup-hook</span>
          <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">gc-cons-threshold</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">*</span> <span class="mi">50</span> <span class="mi">1024</span> <span class="mi">1024</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">most-positive-fixnum</code> is a neat constant that represents the biggest positive
integer that Emacs can handle. There’s also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">most-negative-fixnum</code> that you might
find handy in some cases.</p>

<p>As for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">early-init.el</code> - it was introduced in version 27 and is executed before
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init.el</code>. Its primary purpose is to allow users to configure settings that need
to take effect early in the startup process, such as disabling GUI elements or
optimizing performance. This file is loaded before the package system and GUI
initialization, giving it a unique role in customizing Emacs startup behavior.</p>

<p>Here are some other settings that people like to tweak in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">early-init.el</code>:</p>

<div class="language-emacs-lisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; Disable toolbars, menus, and other visual elements for faster startup:</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">menu-bar-mode</span> <span class="mi">-1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">tool-bar-mode</span> <span class="mi">-1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">scroll-bar-mode</span> <span class="mi">-1</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">inhibit-startup-screen</span> <span class="no">t</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">;; Load themes early to avoid flickering during startup (you need a built-in theme, though)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">load-theme</span> <span class="ss">'modus-operandi</span> <span class="no">t</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">;; tweak native compilation settings</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">native-comp-speed</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope you get the idea! If you have any other tips on speeding up the Emacs
startup time, I’d love to hear them!</p>

<p>That’s all I have for you today. Keep hacking!</p>
