<p>President Trump attended a ceremonial signing of an expanded ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia at the 47th ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 26, 2025, where leaders agreed to withdraw heavy weapons and release prisoners to reduce border tensions . The pact, overseen by Malaysia’s hosts, calls for demining, the removal of heavy artillery and a statement reaffirming both sides&#x27; commitment to refrain from the threat or use of force . The agreement follows deadly clashes in July that killed more than 40 people and forced hundreds of thousands to flee border areas, and comes as President Trump uses his Asia trip to press trade and minerals deals alongside diplomatic efforts .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wdPYSPurW-i5pmmcxRlbFsqrJbab4f2UxNL2rfT-9JF6a9Vq7hO4tDR07q45uZjmA1M0IYvbACxx5X2w_UmPLtM2Ty3itYXMaUhrb4zTyiL_' alt='(From L to R) Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim applauds as Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet, Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and US President Donald Trump hold up documents during the ceremonial signing of a ceasefire agreement on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 26, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Malaysia&#x27;s role: Malaysia helped broker earlier talks and the latest declaration includes plans for regional observers in conflict areas to help monitor the truce .</li><li>July escalation: The July clashes that produced the first ceasefire began after a long-standing, colonial‑era border dispute and lasted several days, displacing large numbers of civilians .</li><li>Political gestures: Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet publicly praised the accord and said he had nominated President Trump for next year’s Nobel Peace Prize following the signing .</li><li>Summit context: The ceremony took place during the ASEAN summit that also formally admitted East Timor as the bloc’s newest member, marking the region’s first expansion since the 1990s .</li></ul><blockquote>This is a momentous day for all of the people of Southeast Asia, as we sign a historic agreement to end the military conflict between Cambodia and Thailand - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He said he helped broker the truce, called the signing a &#x27;momentous day&#x27; and said he also struck trade and critical‑minerals agreements with the two countries during his visit .
