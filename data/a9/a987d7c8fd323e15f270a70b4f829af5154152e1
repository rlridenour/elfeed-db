<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper">MacWhisper</a> on the back end for a lot of the content I publish here at MacSparky, and I’ve been very happy with the results.</p>



<p>In a lot of ways, Artificial Intelligence is a mixed bag, but when it comes to voice-to-text transcription, it’s a pure win. The ability to quickly and accurately convert spoken words into text saves me time and improves my workflow.</p>
