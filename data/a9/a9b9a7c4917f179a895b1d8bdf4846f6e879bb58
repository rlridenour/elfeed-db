<p>Iranian state media released its first official toll from nationwide protests that began in late December, saying 3,117 people were killed, including 2,427 civilians and members of the security forces. Rights monitors and witnesses dispute the scale and say many more deaths may have occurred, citing verification challenges during a communications blackout and reports that bystanders were also among those killed. Separately, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi issued what several outlets described as his most direct warning to the United States, saying Iran would retaliate if attacked again, as Washington blamed the unrest on government mismanagement rather than foreign instigation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/IC-ZENXQ9ct4dxC2Zp2gAyDPQ7tIRvjC48B9oUkh3--OMQSEYra9u2GGjqKlJ3x6Q9PU_XetFjsi3ljReahuOHaJr9hiG2zA6YqXRiiiNjvUJUwVCLEB40W4xwnPrj9ZiPPhnC4YmK7sGtS88KpP7-OtjRqZ5b402JpSmmkzSpGDHG-4tD-2R1LFwyeHG5HQiyzXcpjrH1vmhPtfKdns1w0t_45rFUDksV7XuP9HoilPTRbDhiAxdYvYfQmEesbSnde0reMEHmggx1EAXA' alt='An Iranian flag on the Beheshti Mosque, shown during a foreign media tour in Tehran on Jan. 21, 2026, after damage during recent protests.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Internet blackout: Human rights groups and journalists said the communications shutdown has constrained independent verification of deaths and other claims, complicating efforts to assess the violence.</li><li>Who was hit: Witness accounts described fatalities extending beyond protesters to include bystanders, adding to concerns about indiscriminate harm during the crackdown.</li><li>Activist methodology: HRANA said it builds death estimates by collecting reports from the ground and contacting mortuaries and hospitals, and it reported thousands of confirmed deaths with additional cases under review.</li><li>U.S. framing: U.S. officials said the demonstrations reflected the Iranian leadership’s mismanagement and rejected Tehran’s claims that foreign actors caused the unrest.</li><li>Protest drivers: Reports said protests and strikes were initially fueled by economic grievances before turning into a broader movement challenging Iran’s clerical leadership.</li></ul><blockquote>Firing back with everything we have if we come under renewed attack. - Abbas Araghchi</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iranian government: Iran’s Interior Ministry and the Martyrs Foundation reported 3,117 deaths from the unrest and Iran’s foreign minister warned the United States that Iran would retaliate if attacked.
