<p>Apple Developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, apps on the App Store are provided Store Services Tier
2, the complete suite of all capabilities designed to maximize
visibility, engagement, growth, and operational efficiency.
Developers with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-payment-options-on-the-app-store-in-the-eu/">apps on the App Store in the EU</a> that
communicate and promote offers for digital goods and services can
choose to move their apps to only use Store Services Tier 1 and
pay a reduced store services fee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What follows is a long chart, making clear which features are excluded from Tier 1.</p>

<p>Like I wrote in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/apple_app_store_policy_updates_dma">my larger piece on Apple’s new DMA compliance plans</a>, I don’t think Tier 1 is intended to be a feasible choice for any mainstream apps or games. The whole thing is just a way to assert that 8 percent of the commission developers pay is justified by various features of the App Store itself.</p>
