  <p>Mistakes are a part of life.</p>

<p>They’re not a great part, but when viewed “correctly”, they’re an
opportunity.</p>

<p>Well, we have three opportunities, brought to our attention by a
security researcher. They’re security vulnerabilities that have
been in SuperDuper! since the very first version, released almost
22 years ago.</p>

<p>Today, we’re releasing fixes for the current release (the
SuperDuper! v3.20 Beta is already fixed), a discussion of the
problems, and the steps users can take to mitigate the issues if
they cannot install the update.</p>

<p>We don’t know of any bad actors making use of these exploits as of
this post.</p>
