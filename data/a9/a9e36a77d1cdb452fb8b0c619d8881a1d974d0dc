The Emacs Cat, like me, is a heavy Org mode user. He uses it for note taking, maintaining his personal knowledge base, agenda management, and blogging. He recently decided to <a href="https://olddeuteronomy.github.io/post/emacs-org-config/">share his org mode configuration</a>. It&rsquo;s worth taking a look at.
</p>
<p>
The thing about Org mode is that it&rsquo;s a huge app with lots of functionality and plenty of knobs that can be tuned to make it behave exactly as you want it to. So even if you&rsquo;re a heavy user, it&rsquo;s very possible that there&rsquo;s a knob that you didn&rsquo;t know about that will improve your workflow.
</p>
<p>
One way of discovering those knobs—and other functionality—is to read other people&rsquo;s configurations. That&rsquo;s why The Cat&rsquo;s sharing of his configuration is so useful. It let&rsquo;s us discover things that we didn&rsquo;t know about that might be useful in our own workflows.

<p>
For example, there&rsquo;s a variable, <code>org-return-follows-link</code>, that enables clicking on a link to open it in your browser. I generally use <code>org-open-at-point</code>, bound to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd>, for this. It&rsquo;s a bit more general but it&rsquo;s still nice to have another, simple way of following a link.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of nice suggestions in the Cat&rsquo;s configuration so it&rsquo;s definitely worth your while to spend a couple of minutes reading it.
