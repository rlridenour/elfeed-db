<p>In 2017, historian Timothy Snyder wrote the concise book <em><a href="https://timothysnyder.org/on-tyranny/">On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century</a>, </em>which went on to become a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller. A historian of fascism (then at <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2025/04/04/snyder-on-leaving-yale/">Yale</a>, now at <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/person/timothy-snyder">U. Toronto</a>), Snyder wanted to offer Americans a useful guide for resisting the country’s drift towards authoritarianism. It was handy then and even handier now–especially as the feds bear down on different institutions undergirding American civil society. Law firms, universities, corporations, media outlets–they’re all getting squeezed, and many have already violated the first of Snyder’s 20 lessons: “Do not obey in advance.” Above, you can hear actor John Lithgow read a condensed version of Snyder’s lessons. You can order <a href="https://timothysnyder.org/on-tyranny/">a copy of his book online</a>, or <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2022/09/historian-timothy-snyder-presents-20-lessons-for-defending-democracy-against-tyranny.html">explore here a related video series that Snyder produced a few years back</a>.
