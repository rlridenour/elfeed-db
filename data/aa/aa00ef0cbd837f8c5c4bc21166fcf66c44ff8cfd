<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Multiple men have remained in senior roles at Oxford for months or years after allegations of sexual misconduct emerged against them, Bloomberg found in a nine-month investigation based on interviews with almost 50 people as well as documents and other records.</em></p>
<p>Regarding <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/people/john-tasioulas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tasioulas</a>, Griffiths reports:</p>
<p class="ArticleBodyText_articleBodyContent__17wqE typography_articleBody__3UcBa" style="padding-left: 40px;" data-component="paragraph"><em>Oxford had been investigating harassment allegations against Tasioulas since April, according to the people and documents reviewed by Bloomberg. Senior figures from the institute, set up about five years ago to examine the complex moral questions thrown up by artificial intelligence, told colleagues that a change of leadership would mark a different tone, according to some of the people&#8230;</em></p>
<p class="ArticleBodyText_articleBodyContent__17wqE typography_articleBody__3UcBa" style="padding-left: 40px;" data-component="paragraph"><em>Women who gave evidence in the investigations saw the outcomes as significant victories.</em></p>
<p class="ArticleBodyText_articleBodyContent__17wqE typography_articleBody__3UcBa" style="padding-left: 40px;" data-component="paragraph"><em>But Oxford’s overall record of handling other harassment allegations over the years has been more checkered, people familiar with the situation said&#8230; </em></p>
<p data-component="paragraph">That said, &#8220;Women involved in the Tasioulas investigation felt it was handled well.&#8221;</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">However, the article takes as support for its claim that &#8220;Oxford’s collegiate system and complaints processes make it hard to hold sexual predators to account&#8221; that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;" data-component="paragraph"><em>While Tasioulas was under investigation and suspended from his job at the AI ethics institute, he continued to go to dinners and other events at Balliol, the college he was attached to, according to people who also attended.</em></p>
<p>The Bloomberg article does not state what the specific allegations against Tasioulas are, nor does it share the findings of the university&#8217;s internal investigation of those allegations.</p>
<p>While the article reports that Tasioulas resigned from his position at the Institute for Ethics in AI, it does not mention whether he has retained his appointment as a member of the university&#8217;s <a href="https://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/faculty-members?filter-421-membership-2428736=93346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">philosophy faculty</a>. He is no longer listed among the philosophy faculty, nor at Balliol College, with which he had been affiliated. An email to him received an auto-reply stating &#8220;This email address is no longer in use&#8221;. [see Update 2, below]

<p><strong>UPDATE 4 </strong>(12/3/25): <em>The Times</em> <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/education/article/oxford-university-third-academic-resign-misconduct-claims-6cwwsp87h" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>:</p>
<p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Tasioulas, 60, resigned in September as the inaugural director of Oxford’s Institute of Ethics in AI, which was set up in 2020 to “shape innovation and enhance global public debate”. The Times has seen documents confirming that he was the subject of an internal investigation under the university’s harassment policy. </em><em>The investigation began in April<span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"> and was looking at allegations of aggressive and bullying behaviour as well as harassment. Its findings have not been made public and Tasioulas has written on social media that he has been the target of “false allegations”.</span></em></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 3 </strong>(11/22/25): On Friday, Tasioulas <a href="https://x.com/JTasioulas/status/1991825728095031618" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X (formerly Twitter): &#8220;A recent Bloomberg article referred to false allegations made against me. I am currently pursuing legal remedies in relation to this unfortunate matter and so will not comment further.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: A reader draws my attention to a <a href="https://x.com/JTasioulas/status/1986180790720602395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> from Tasioulas on November 5th where he notes, in regard to a caption on a video in which he is referred to as a professor at Oxford, &#8220;the captions in this video are out of date as I have now left Oxford.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>: The article also mentions another case concerning philosophy, but presents it in a way that may give readers a mistaken impression of what was found to have happened. Griffiths writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The experiences described to Bloomberg are particularly disappointing to those who have previously hoped for significant changes in Oxford’s approach. In June 2013, an inquest into the suicide of philosophy student Charlotte Coursier heard she received “crazed and rambling” emails from a male academic with whom she’d had a relationship. Coursier’s death prompted 135 current and former students to write to the university’s leadership calling on it to use its powers to more effectively investigate harassment allegations and to improve its processes for the future. Many people who spoke to Bloomberg felt that Oxford had not gone far enough.</em></p>
<p>However, the male academic in that case, who had initially been dismissed from his position at Oxford, was <a href="https://dailynous.com/2014/08/02/ketland-reinstated-at-oxford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later reinstated by the university</a> after an external judge ruled that the university had erred in the judgment that led to his dismissal. So while the case may perhaps serve as an example illustrating a need for the university &#8220;to more effectively investigate harassment allegations and to improve its processes for the future,&#8221; it does not seem to be a case in which Oxford &#8220;had not gone far enough&#8221; in its attempts to rout out harassment. <strong>Note that this update is not a defense of anyone&#8217;s behavior in any of these cases, nor an attempt to show that the overall thesis of Griffith&#8217;s article is mistaken. It&#8217;s simply a clarification of some facts in a case mentioned in Griffith&#8217;s article.</strong></p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/11/19/sexual-harassment-investigations-at-oxford/">Sexual Harassment Investigations at Oxford (updated)</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
