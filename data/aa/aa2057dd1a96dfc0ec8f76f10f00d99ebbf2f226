<p>Public broadcasters in Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands and Slovenia have announced they will not take part in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest after the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) confirmed Israel will be allowed to compete in Vienna next May despite the ongoing war in Gaza. The four broadcasters argued that continuing alongside Israel would undermine the contest’s claim to political neutrality, citing the scale of civilian suffering in Gaza and alleging that Israel has used Eurovision for political messaging. The EBU said its general assembly saw a &quot;large majority&quot; of members back newly tightened rules on voting and neutrality and concluded there was no need to hold a specific vote on Israel’s participation, allowing the contest to proceed with &quot;additional safeguards&quot; in place. Israel rejects accusations linked to the war and says it is facing a broader campaign to delegitimize it, while the dispute has reignited a long-running debate over how far cultural events like Eurovision can or should stay separate from international conflicts.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/x8uCLul0pY7HSt6jktdp98Xdv1S0pyeW0mSZKaiAtGavzR0ONrbj-k63ZIpuk8dRUd6UyWH8k7FEWhVzhZR-ltBb2DQxMpbCK0vDZIg2ltW--gwdp3sP1TmNM6YPHBwD8-HWtl__BBv2DQChkB2ah5Liv-sTFs0XPxw0pQdo3tdGjsDTixMiuwN6NhD55aL00G59Io239SFKrKNT0ComrTqQNCAFdn1wAHs1MtXIgACL8UO-t_q10kuwutviES6I2TuiIwfXGU-GrW1OzQ' alt='A photographer captures images inside Vienna&#x27;s Wiener Stadthalle, the venue for the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Neutrality reforms: The EBU said it had adopted stricter voting and neutrality rules, including measures meant to reinforce trust after allegations that Israel benefited from manipulated voting in the previous contest.</li><li>Broadcasters’ wording: Spain’s RTVE said the Gaza situation and Israel’s use of Eurovision for political purposes made it &quot;increasingly difficult&quot; to keep the event neutral, while Ireland’s RTÉ called participation &quot;unconscionable&quot; given ongoing civilian suffering.</li><li>Iceland’s position: Iceland’s public broadcaster stated it was reassessing its involvement and considering whether to join the boycott, indicating that further withdrawals could still follow.</li><li>Russia and Belarus contrast: Several reports noted that Russia remains barred from Eurovision over the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, even as Russian and Belarusian athletes were recently cleared to compete as neutrals at the next Winter Olympics, underscoring differing approaches across cultural and sporting arenas.</li><li>Long-running tensions: Coverage highlighted that Eurovision has repeatedly faced political disputes around Israel’s entries since the 1970s, with past controversies over lyrics, staging and calls for boycotts whenever regional conflicts intensified.</li></ul><blockquote>Culture unites, but not at any price - Dutch broadcasting executive (AVROTROS)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Broadcasting Union (EBU): The EBU said there was &quot;clear support&quot; among its members for the reforms it introduced to &quot;reinforce trust and protect neutrality&quot; and that a specific vote on Israel’s participation was therefore unnecessary.
