<p>When you are self-employed, you need to be very well organized. There is never anybody looking over your shoulder, reminding you of everything on your to-do list. You don’t have a project manager reminding you of every step in your big projects. I use <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> in Emacs to manage all of my tasks, to-do lists, and projects.

<p>Many people have already <a href="https://www.badykov.com/emacs/be-productive-with-org-mode/">written about</a> <a href="https://medium.com/emacs/how-i-tackle-projects-with-org-mode-ee5d6b08f41">why Org-mode</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.5555/1344170.1344179">is a good choice</a> <a href="https://karl-voit.at/orgmode/">for this</a>, so I am not going to. I will just mention that many years ago, perhaps around 2007, I read <a href="https://amzn.to/3YgIo6j"><em>Getting Things Done</em> by David Allen</a> and got inspired to implement something like it in Org-mode. The system has slowly evolved over the years, but it has also become unweildy.</p>

<p>For the past few years, I had been tagging my tasks with the states <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TODO</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEXT</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DONE</code>, primarily. I had some extra states sitting around for things that got canceled or delegated, and at some point I added a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WAITING</code> tag for when I needed somebody else to finish something, first. But the problem was, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TODO</code> items really piled up. They became uncomfortable to sort through.</p>

<p>Inspired by a <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/10/shuffling-my-org-mode-unscheduled-tasks/">blog post by Sacha Chua</a> earlier this week, I cleaned up my to-do states. I added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STARTED</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SOMEDAY</code>, then went through the big list of outstanding items and re-evaluated their proper states. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SOMEDAY</code> won in 80% of cases, which really cleaned up the list. Now I can begin my day with a custom agenda command that looks for just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEXT</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STARTED</code> tasks, so I know what is most important. And I can end my day looking at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TODO</code> tasks to see if any should be switched to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEXT</code>.</p>

<p>Here is what my configuration looks like now. First, I configure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-todo-keywords</code> to handle the various states that my to-do items need. I am hoping that someday I’ll pare this down, but for now, this works.</p>

<div class="language-emacs-lisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-todo-keywords</span> 
      <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nc">sequence</span> <span class="s">"TODO(t)"</span> <span class="s">"NEXT(n)"</span> <span class="s">"STARTED(s!)"</span> <span class="s">"WAITING(w@/!)"</span> <span class="s">"|"</span> <span class="s">"DONE(d!)"</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="nc">sequence</span> <span class="s">"SOMEDAY(o)"</span> <span class="s">"|"</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="nc">sequence</span> <span class="s">"|"</span> <span class="s">"DELEGATED(g@/!)"</span> <span class="s">"CANCELLED(c!)"</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I then added a “daily driver” command to my agenda to let me see the most important tasks today. This would probably be a good place for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add-to-list</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setq</code>, but it’s just an example!</p>

<div class="language-emacs-lisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-agenda-custom-commands</span>
      <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s">"n"</span> <span class="s">"Next tasks"</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">todo</span> <span class="s">"STARTED"</span><span class="p">)</span>
                           <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">todo</span> <span class="s">"NEXT"</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, after Sacha suggested it in a post on Mastodon, I configured to-do items to automatically switch to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">STARTED</code> state when I clock-in to them.</p>

<div class="language-emacs-lisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-clock-in-switch-to-state</span> <span class="s">"STARTED"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, I have been playing around with configuring <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-stuck-projects</code> to be more useful. I tag all of my projects with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@project</code> tag, and then have my to-do entries underneath them as keywords. I do not think that this works as intended yet. I don’t think I will be able to figure out the proper settings here until I have another stuck project; let’s hope that never happens, and I never need this report.</p>

<div class="language-emacs-lisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-stuck-projects</span> <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"+@project/-DONE-SOMEDAY"</span>
                          <span class="c1">;; Keywords to identify non-stuck projects</span>
                          <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"TODO"</span> <span class="s">"NEXT"</span> <span class="s">"STARTED"</span><span class="p">)</span>
                          <span class="c1">;; Keywords to identify stuck projects.</span>
                          <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"WAITING"</span><span class="p">)</span>
                          <span class="s">""</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only lesson that I can really hope to share with you, dear reader, is that it is a good idea to examine your task management system regularly to fine-tune it to your needs. What I have noticed is that I can come up with great task management plans, but the implementation rarely survives contact with the real world.</p>

<p>If, upon reading this, you have questions or suggestions, especially for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-stuck-projects</code>, I would love to hear about it in the comments, or <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@pymander">on Mastodon</a>. Thank you for reading!</p>
