<p>From the conference website:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span class="w-text-block w-text-left "><span class="w-text-content">During existential moments in human history, philosophy has served as a refuge, a place of retreat that connects reflection across centuries, whatever the conditions. To practice philosophy in moments of crisis is to connect with our common humanity. </span></span></em></p>
<p>This is an in-person conference. You can learn more about it <a href="https://university.kse.ua/events/existential-questions-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
