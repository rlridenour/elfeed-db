<p>Back in July, I was lucky enough to have my friend Louie Mantia <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428">on The Talk Show</a> to talk about Liquid Glass and (as I wrote in the show notes) “the worrisome state of Apple’s UI design overall”. This was probably my favorite episode of the show all year, and I think it holds up extremely well now that we’re all using Liquid Glass, across Apple’s platforms, in release versions.</p>

<p>Included in the show notes was a link to Mantia’s essay making his case against Dye’s decade-long stint leading Apple’s UI design teams, “<a href="https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html">A Responsibility to the Industry</a>”, which began thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Firstly, I maintain that it makes absolutely no sense that Alan
Dye has the power he has, because he simply has no taste. But
what’s worse is that he wields that power so clumsily, so
carelessly. And because it goes unchallenged, unchecked by someone
higher than him, the entire industry suffers the consequences.</p>

  <p>And good riddance!!</p>
