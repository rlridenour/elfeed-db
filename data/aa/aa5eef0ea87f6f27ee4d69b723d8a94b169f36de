<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has removed his powerful chief of staff Andriy Yermak, who had served as his main political enforcer in Kyiv and a lead negotiator in wartime talks with Russia and Western partners. Yermak’s departure follows an anticorruption raid targeting associates in his orbit and growing domestic criticism over alleged graft and centralization of power in the presidential office. European officials are concerned that losing a familiar counterpart in Kyiv could slow delicate peace discussions and coordination on aid, while some voices in Russia and the West argue the shake‑up might open space for a different approach to negotiations. The Trump administration in Washington is portrayed by European media as ready to use the transition to push its own priorities on the conflict, adding a new layer of great‑power politics to Ukraine’s internal reshuffle.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ioGzn58barkdDUM6MAOS81o85j4SOmx5uLu1j-Ww6FUSjQ9ctr-E8e_hrsb_GQv2sA0GY6mqBm_MmzjXzCkG4tmgkGS42wDg8_eoU7Y037iVmdvmZhGr_t3Us4Sgki-ndL4SuN03eyNOQ_S-VujPwjQISQwZkZnIaMsXZzNqTRG6cPE8__hZlIlOtn1iXfJQAnCN6UvFtR8pCQ' alt='A Ukrainian soldier in the eastern Donbas region, where decisions made by President Zelensky’s office, including those once shaped by Andriy Yermak, directly affect front-line realities.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Yermak’s rise: A former film producer and lawyer, Andriy Yermak first met Volodymyr Zelensky in 2011 during the president’s television career and later became his gatekeeper in government, overseeing access, messaging, and many key appointments in the presidential administration.</li><li>Anticorruption trigger: The immediate backdrop to Yermak’s exit was an operation by Ukraine’s anticorruption bodies targeting people close to him, which opposition figures seized on as evidence of deeper governance problems in the presidential office.</li><li>European unease: European Union diplomats viewed Yermak as their primary channel for discussing security assistance and peace frameworks with Kyiv, and now worry that building trust with a new counterpart could slow already fragile diplomatic efforts.</li><li>US opportunity: Analysts in Europe say President Trump’s administration appears ready to exploit the leadership vacuum around Zelensky to press harder for its preferred peace terms and burden‑sharing arrangements among allies.</li><li>Peace‑process uncertainty: With Yermak gone, Ukraine must quickly appoint new figures to handle both internal discipline and external talks, raising questions about whether Kyiv will adjust its stance on territorial concessions or ceasefire sequencing in any future negotiations.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukrainian presidency allies: Supporters of Zelensky’s decision frame the move as a necessary step to respond to corruption allegations and refresh the wartime leadership team while keeping overall strategic goals unchanged.
