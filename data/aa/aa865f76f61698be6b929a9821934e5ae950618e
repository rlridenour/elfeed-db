<p>I often think about how to write effective alt text because I&rsquo;ve been working on
getting better at writing alt text for the comics I post on Mastodon.
I just found this article I really enjoyed <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2024/05/my-approach-to-alt-text.html">on writing alt text from Adrian Roselli</a></p>
<p>It has a lot of great links to other perspectives on alt text, and it closes
with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing alternative text is not a technical exercise (at least, not beyond
basic WCAG conformance); it is copywriting tailored to your audience and
constraints</p>
</blockquote>
