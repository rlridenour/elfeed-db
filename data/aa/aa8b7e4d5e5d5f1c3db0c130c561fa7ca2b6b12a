<p>I am currently polishing up my web page and I am now focussing on the little annoying formatting / alignment issues.</p>
<p>One of these is involving a default shortcode called <code>{&lt; youtube &gt;}</code></p>
<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: I deliberately missed off second brace as I am writing this in org!)</p>
<p>Anyways, I have the following markdown:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>{&lt; youtube IDK-4lhQ-sE &gt;}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>A gradual fading version of a portrait I did for my girlfriends
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>parents.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Using ArtRage and Infinite Painter on various drawing tablets
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which produces the following displayed html:</p>
<figure><img src="https://emacs.dyerdwelling.family/ox-hugo/2022-09-01_11-02.jpg" width="100%">
</figure>

<p>Note how the text starts right after the youtube video even though the markdown includes a carriage return.</p>
<p>So the first potential fix is to add a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> just after the shortcode, which in fact does work, however there is one catch.  The markdown file is just one of hundreds I have generated from my youtube channel.  If I add this then I will have to apply it to all videos.</p>
<p>I maintain a list of my youtube videos in a single org file and technically it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to emacs macro / grep / replace my way through it, however I don&rsquo;t like this idea too much as I don&rsquo;t really want to be mixing html with a markdown file.</p>
<p>So on to plan B.</p>
<p>With a little investigation I can see that the video is embedded in an iframe.  This presents the possibility of a quick and dirty fix that may have repercussions down the line.</p>
<p>Lets add in a little css:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">iframe {
    padding: 0rem 0rem 1rem 0rem;
    margin: 0rem 0rem 0rem 0rem;
}
</code></pre><p>I have just applied a little padding to the bottom of the iframe!  I thought I would include <code>margin</code> also just in case I wanted to do it that way in the future.  Right lets see what this looks like now:</p>

<p>yup that will do nicely!</p>
<p>for now&hellip;</p>
