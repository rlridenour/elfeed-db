<p>You chose Fastmail because you care about your privacy. You understand why independent providers matter. But there’s a crucial piece of the privacy puzzle that often gets overlooked: your search engine.</p><p>Every time you search the web, you share what you’re curious about, what problems you’re solving, what health symptoms you want to understand, what you’re shopping for, and what matters to you. For many of us, that search bar is the gateway to everything we do online. So why hand that data over to companies whose business model depends on tracking you?</p><h2 id="the-search-problem" tabindex="-1"><strong>The ‘search’ problem</strong></h2><p>Even with the most private browser, if you’re using a search engine that tracks you, you’re still handing over valuable data about your interests, location, and browsing patterns.</p><p>Traditional search engines make money by:</p><ul> <li>Tracking your search history to build detailed profiles</li> <li>Following you across the web to see which results you click</li> <li>Selling your data to advertisers who use it for targeted campaigns</li> <li>Combining your search behavior with other services to create comprehensive profiles about you</li> </ul><p>It’s the same surveillance model we’ve been helping you escape by moving away from other commercial service providers.</p><h2 id="then-there-s-kagi-search-that-works-for-you" tabindex="-1"><strong>Then there’s Kagi: Search that works for you</strong></h2><p>We’re excited to share that Fastmail has joined Kagi’s “Friends of Kagi” program — a collection of privacy-first companies that share our values and commitment to putting customers first.</p><p>Kagi (pronounced KAH-gee) is a paid search engine that delivers high-quality results without tracking, profiling, or advertising. Like Fastmail, they’re user-funded with no external shareholders pushing for data monetization.</p><h3 id="what-makes-kagi-different" tabindex="-1"><strong>What makes Kagi different?</strong></h3><ul> <li><strong>No tracking</strong>: Kagi doesn’t track your searches, IP address, or browsing behavior. They don’t build profiles or share data with third parties.</li> <li><strong>Better results</strong>: Without the need to maximize ad clicks, Kagi focuses on giving you the best answer quickly. You can customize which sites you see more or less of.</li> <li><strong>Ad-free</strong>: No sponsored results competing with actual answers. Just the information you’re looking for.</li> <li><strong>Privacy by business model</strong>: Just like Fastmail, you pay for the service, and they work for you. No split loyalties.</li> </ul><h3 id="completing-your-privacy-stack" tabindex="-1"><strong>Completing your privacy stack</strong></h3><p>If you’ve already switched to Fastmail and a private browser, adding Kagi creates a powerful privacy stack:</p><ol> <li><strong>Private email</strong> (Fastmail): Protects your communications and blocks tracking pixels</li> <li><strong>Private browser</strong> (Vivaldi, Firefox, Brave, or Safari): Limits cookies, fingerprinting, and tracking</li> <li><strong>Private search</strong> (Kagi): Keeps your queries and interests confidential</li> </ol><h2 id="how-it-works" tabindex="-1"><strong>How it works</strong></h2><p>Kagi is a search engine, not a browser. You can use Kagi with any browser you prefer. Simply set Kagi as your default search engine, and when you type a search into your browser’s address bar, it sends that search to Kagi — all without tracking you.</p><h2 id="ready-to-build-your-privacy-stack" tabindex="-1"><strong>Ready to build your privacy stack?</strong></h2><ol> <li>Switch to Fastmail for private, ad-free email</li> <li>Choose a privacy-focused browser</li> <li>Change your default search to Kagi</li> <li>Use browser extensions like Privacy Badger for additional protection</li> </ol><h2 id="final-thoughts" tabindex="-1"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2><p>Privacy isn’t about having something to hide — it’s about having the right to control your own information. By choosing Fastmail, a private browser, and now Kagi, you’re building a digital environment where you’re in control. Where companies serve you rather than the other way around. Where your data stays yours.</p><p>That’s the internet we believe in, and we’re proud to partner with companies like Kagi who share that vision.</p><h2 id="special-offer-for-fastmail-customers" tabindex="-1"><strong>Special offer for Fastmail customers</strong></h2><p>As part of our “Friends of Kagi” partnership, Fastmail customers will get the first 3 months free on the Kagi Professional plan using this <a href="https://kagi.com/p/FASTMAIL8057F5C568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>.</p>
