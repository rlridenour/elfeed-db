        <p>Over the past few years, I've developed a running habit, lost 35 lbs, and, after this weekend, will have run three marathons within 18 months.</p>
<p>As I'm getting organised ahead of the race, I thought I'd write up a few (meandering) notes encompassing my (1) training journey, (2) tools, (3) gear, and (4) recommendations for getting started.</p>

<h1 id="1.-training" tabindex="-1">1. Training</h1>
<h2 id="2021%3A-14.98-miles" tabindex="-1">2021: 14.98 miles</h2>
<p>In 2021, shortly after the birth of our son, I decided to get my act together and start exercising.</p>
<p>I had been weighing in regularly through the pandemic, but, in context of the moment, the increase in weight just hadn't registered as it would normally. That all changed when we got home from the hospital. It turned out I'd gained roughly 30 lbs.</p>
<p>For any Bonanza! (even Bionic) listeners, you'll know I've had a certain inclination toward faddish tools to improve my health. So it will come as no surprise that I sought something in that vein.</p>
<p>At the recommendation of a friend, I came across <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/c25k-5k-running-coach-map/id485971733">C25K</a> (i.e., Couch to 5K), which, despite the name, is actually a really solid training program to start running. You run a little, walk a little a few days a week and slowly build to the point you can run a 5K (i.e., 3.1 miles).</p>
<p>I got started, but made the error — as I'd done with previous daliances with running — of going too quickly.</p>
<p>I felt a sense of urgency to lose the weight and, given those short bursts of running, I wanted to make it count. So I'd run hard for those short segments. And, to make things worse, I started to do the C25K sessions — or approximate my own — on additional days.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, I ended up with shin splints and all sorts of other aches and pains.</p>
<p>Rather than just address the problem — running too much (and too fast) too early — I bought some better running shoes. I'd heard good things about Hoka from friends and colleagues, so bought some Hoka Arahi 5 shoes.</p>
<p>While the Arahi 5 were <em>fine</em>, they are stability shoes. Meaning, if your feet have any sort of pronation — under or over — stability shoes help keep your feet, ankles, and legs in the right position.</p>
<p>For people starting out, the wisdom goes to visit a running shop and get their recommendation. I won't necessarily dissuade you from doing so — you should certainly confirm you're wearing the right shoe size at a minimum (I wasn't) —  but, in my case, the stability route was just flat wrong for me. Studies increasingly indicate that pronation is natural and, within reason, you shouldn't necessarily overcompensate for it.</p>
<p>Hoka are also known for their max cushion shoes, but stability shoes tend to be more rigid. (The mushy cushion would be counter to the stability objective.) So the Arahi 5 ended up just worsening my leg problems and, shortly after, I stopped running.</p>
<h2 id="2022%3A-491.74-miles" tabindex="-1">2022: 491.74 miles</h2>
<p>Coming into 2022, my weight had worsened and I was motivated to get into better shape.</p>
<p>Again, I reached for a fad. I signed up for <a href="https://www.future.co/">Future</a>, which offers less expensive access to personal training. I was assigned a trainer and she helped me build out a program, which included a balance of running, Future's weight classes, and even some Peloton cycling.</p>
<p>It was fine! But it wasn't for me and, by February or March, I churned out.</p>
<p>Despite failing to stick, Future did help me get running a bit again. I was getting out about 15 miles per month. Low. I tried a few different apps and, from memory, flirted with C25K again.</p>
<p>My breakthrough was in May 2022. I had re-downloaded the <a href="https://www.nike.com/gb/nrc-app">Nike Running Club (NRC) app</a> and stumbled across their training programs and guided runs.</p>
<p>My wife, Emily, had talked a lot about enjoying some of Peloton's guided walks/runs. And, based on a preview or two, I liked the sound of Coach Bennett, Nike's Global Running Head Coach.</p>
<p>You put on your music and, as you run, Coach Bennett chimes in over the top to walk you through your run.</p>
<p>While some of the content is a little cheesy — and Coach Bennett is almost uncomfortably close to being a real life Ted Lasso — I can say without a doubt that those guided runs were the key to getting me into a consistent running habit.</p>
<p>A lot of the content is good. The training programs too. But it was a simple message that changed everything for me: slow down.</p>
<p>In my head, running had always been entwined with a goal of going fast. You're running! Run! There are myriad adages to the contrary — it's a marathon not a sprint, etc. — but I'd simply never really considered it.</p>
<p>Once I did, my experience radically changed. Running became something more meditative and soothing.</p>
<p>I grappled with shin splints and other maladies for a bit, but my body adjusted. I ran 19 miles in May, 43 miles in June, 52 miles in July, 68 miles in August and September, and 76 miles in October.</p>
<p>Somewhere in that stretch, I signed up for my first race. Just a 5K. I wanted to have something to work toward. (Another concept that has stuck over the years.) But I came down with Covid and missed the race that summer.</p>
<p>To make up for it, I signed up for a 10K in October 2022. I set a target of 60 minutes, but ended up finishing it in 56 minutes with a pace of 9:09/mile.</p>
<p>That's not particularly fast! But, considering where I'd been, it felt like lightspeed.</p>
<h2 id="2023%3A-825.95-miles" tabindex="-1">2023: 825.95 miles</h2>
<p>In 2023, I started to push for more material distance.</p>
<p>I ran my first half marathon in July 2023 in Dallas. For anyone who has lived in/around Dallas in July, you'll know that probably wasn't the best idea. But it was a formative experience.</p>
<p>I ran it in 2 hours 27 minutes. I had tried 'fueling' in training — with Clif Bloks — but had my understanding of them all wrong. I went out too fast. I cramped. I got sunburned. A tough day.</p>
<p>Around this point, I gave up on the NRC guided runs and programs. Instead, I started to use my own spreadsheets to track my training and pursue various plans.</p>
<p>And, around the same time, I signed up for the 2023 BMW Dallas Marathon on a whim.</p>
<p>...And then I was offered a position at the 2024 TCS London Marathon, which I also accepted.</p>
<p>I ended up on a 32-34 week training program ahead of London.</p>
<p>Training for a marathon takes about 16-17 weeks (assuming you have a relative baseline). With Dallas in December and London in April, it worked out that I'd have a week off after Dallas and then build once again.</p>
<p>I signed up for a few half marathons in between and started to make a lot of progress. In November 2023, I finished the Toyota Music Factory Half Marathon in just over 2 hours — almost a 30 minute improvement over July.</p>
<p>I went into the Dallas Marathon with the general goal of <em>finishing</em>. And I did! But it wasn't pretty.</p>
<p>I'd run much of the course during my training and felt confident, but had misunderstood a key 10 mile stretch around White Rock Lake. I'd assumed it was on a flat running trail — where I'd done most of my training — but it was actually in the surrounding neighbourhoods. And those were shockingly hilly. (Considering Dallas is otherwise flat and geographically bereft of anything interesting.)</p>
<p>I had graduated from my Hokas by this point — albeit with another pair of Arahis in between — and branched out into some other brands. But I had little-to-no proper understanding of the &quot;right&quot; shoes for the job.</p>
<p>I ran in the Saucony Endorphin Shift 3. By all accounts, a very mediocre pair of shoes. I'd run most of my training in them, so they probably had about 250 miles on them at the time of the race and, by mile 15, it started to show.</p>
<p>I finished in 4:59:51. Like with my summer 13.1, I had cramp problems and all sorts of other issues. Still, I was pleased to have done it.</p>
<h2 id="2024%3A-986.34-miles" tabindex="-1">2024: 986.34 miles</h2>
<p>After struggling through the Dallas Marathon, I decided to make some changes to strategy.</p>
<p>I decided to have a proper rotation of shoes. I opted for New Balance 1080v13 as my daily, Saucony Endorphin Speed 3 as my tempo, and the New Balance SC Trainer V2 for long runs. And, later, I bought some New Balance SC Elite V4 for race day.</p>
<p>I also decided to cutback on alcohol. I was in the habit of having a glass or two of wine most evenings and felt it may've been holding me back.</p>
<p>In the ensuing weeks, I improved in most areas. I got much faster, my sleep improved, and so on.</p>
<p>I ran the Too Cold to Hold Half Marathon in Dallas in January 2024 and cruised to a 1 hour 56 minute finish. No cramp or otherwise.</p>
<p>I was going through a lot at the time. My aunt, uncle, and cousin died in a house fire, my mother-in-law was hospitalised, and, simultaneously, my company was shutting down. I honestly don't know how I would've coped if I wasn't running.</p>
<p>I ran London in April and finished with a time of 4:14:41. Roughly a 45 minute improvement over Dallas a few months prior.</p>
<p>I hoped to come close to 4 hours, but just couldn't quite get there.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, I continued running regularly and tried to hit 1,000 miles for the year. I came close! But just short.</p>
<h2 id="2025%3A-350-miles-(so-far)" tabindex="-1">2025: 350 miles (so far)</h2>
<p>I don't know exactly what to expect this weekend.</p>
<p>Both my mother-in-law and father-in-law passed away unexpectedly — within a few days of each other — in February. I was on parental duty, which meant marathon training took a backseat.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it's probably for the best. I was running half-injured and needed a reset.</p>
<p>I've hit the long runs in my training. And I've done <em>a lot</em> more hill work since we moved to the UK. I also got a new 13.1 PR in February of 1:54 or so.</p>
<p>So is there a chance I'll improve on last year, despite the diminished training? Not sure! I'm going into the race looser and with less pressure. I'll see how I feel on the day.</p>
<p>After this race, I'm going to focus on improving my 13.1 time. I'd love to get to 1:45 or so. My next 13.1 race is in September.</p>
<p>...I also just entered the 2026 London Marathon ballot while drafting this.</p>
<h1 id="2.-tools" tabindex="-1">2. Tools</h1>
<h2 id="apple-watch-ultra-%26-airpods-pro" tabindex="-1">Apple Watch Ultra &amp; AirPods Pro</h2>
<p>I bought an Apple Watch Ultra when it was first released. I remember being a little embarrassed at the time, but I was aiming for my first marathon and my older watch — maybe a Series 6? — just didn't have sufficient battery life.</p>
<p>I tend to run without my phone, so tether AirPods Pro to my Watch. It has served me well throughout all the miles I've run over the past few years.</p>
<p>I still run with the original Apple Watch Ultra. It's held up fine, but the battery has degraded. I'm looking forward to the Apple Watch Ultra 3 later this year.</p>
<p>I should also note that I wear my Apple Watch to sleep. I've found it to be helpful in keeping track and mapping it out alongside the running, weigh, etc. trends. I've dabbled with a few apps for parsing the sleep data separately — Autosleep, Rise, etc. — but none have stuck.</p>
<h2 id="data%3A-tempo" tabindex="-1">Data: Tempo</h2>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tempo-run-log-insights/id1106746589">Tempo</a> is a wonderful indie running app.</p>
<p>It piggy-backs off your Health/Workout data to provide a broad variety of helpful insights into your running. You can also use it to build training plans and schedule particular runs.</p>
<p>I setup a new week of runs every Monday.</p>
<p>I also use the tags to track the mileage I have in each shoe in my rotation.</p>
<h2 id="planning%3A-calendar-hack" tabindex="-1">Planning: Calendar Hack</h2>
<p>After developing a running habit with NRC, I transitioned to building my own plans.</p>
<p>To do so, I stumbled across <a href="https://www.defy.org/hacks/calendarhack/">Calendar Hack</a>. It's a simple tool that allows you to input a target race date — anything from 5K upward — and select from a variety of well-known training philosophies.</p>
<p>It'll pump out a simple weekly training plan, which you can then export and follow however you choose.</p>
<p>I followed a version of Hal Hidgon's Novice and Intermediate plans for Dallas and London. I can't recall what I built this London training block around, but probably something similar.</p>
<h2 id="nutrition%3A-foodnoms-%26-reframe" tabindex="-1">Nutrition: Foodnoms &amp; Reframe</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.reframeapp.com/">Reframe</a> every day for a year to track my alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>I wasn't a heavy drinker, but it was just somewhat of a passive habit. Reframe helped me become far more mindful about it and, as a result, I started to drink less regularly.</p>
<p>I also got into a habit of using <a href="https://foodnoms.com/">Foodnoms</a> for calorie tracking. It's a great native iOS app with tasteful AI features. I'm not closely monitoring my diet, but I really enjoy using the app and have continued to use it daily for most of the past two years.</p>
<h2 id="logging%2Ftracking%3A-obsidian-%26-numbers" tabindex="-1">Logging/Tracking: Obsidian &amp; Numbers</h2>
<p>I've built out a daily template in <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, which I use for journaling, run tracking, and the like. I know its superpower is cross-linking, but, honestly, I use it as a powerful journaling tool and means to plan yearly goals.</p>
<p>I write daily notes, as well as monthly recaps to map to my objectives for the year. And then I wrap-up with yearly notes and always work through <a href="https://stephango.com/40-questions">Friend of The Blog Stephan's 40 Questions list</a>.</p>
<p>It's not running-specific, but I have to say that it's been a key component of me becoming more consistent with running.</p>
<p>More running and health specific, I track all of my running in a Numbers sheet, which I keep synced via iCloud across my devices. I previously used Google Sheets, but have preferred using Numbers.</p>
<p>It's all duplicative of the data in Health.app, Tempo, etc., but I find it very useful to go through the manual effort of writing it out and keeping track.</p>
<h2 id="misc." tabindex="-1">Misc.</h2>
<ul>
<li>I use <a href="https://onthegomap.com/#/create">onthegomap.com</a> to plan my long runs.</li>
<li>I use Strava's <a href="https://www.strava.com/running-pace-calculator">basic pace tool</a> to plan targets.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="3.-gear" tabindex="-1">3. Gear</h1>
<h2 id="shoes" tabindex="-1">Shoes</h2>
<p>This is obviously an extraordinarily subjective thing, but my current shoe rotation is all New Balance:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Balance Rebel V4 for basic/tempo runs.</li>
<li>New Balance More V4 for daily/recovery runs.</li>
<li>New Balance SC Trainer V2 for longer runs.</li>
<li>New Balance SC Elite V4 for races.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have stuck with New Balance as my go-to, as they are much friendlier for wide feet. I also love the aesthetic of their current line — like the SC Elite and the SC Trainer.</p>
<p>If you're wanting to learn a little more, I'm a fan of <a href="https://believeintherun.com/">Believe In The Run</a>. They put together great reviews, covering a broad variety of runners, body shapes, styles, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="clothing" tabindex="-1">Clothing</h2>
<p>I'll be running the marathon this weekend in all <a href="https://banditrunning.com">Bandit</a> gear and a <a href="https://cieleathletics.com/collections/go-fit">Ciele GOCap</a>.</p>
<p>On the former, Bandit are <em>the</em> challenger brand in the running space. (And great people too.) Some of the style skews too young for me, but the functionality is top notch. You can tell it's all designed by people who really care about running.</p>
<p>A lot of Bandit's products are great, but their <a href="https://banditrunning.com/products/vento%E2%84%A2-5-mens-training-short?variant=43593134375062">Vento shorts</a> are the best I've come across. I only got them a few weeks ago, but am kicking myself I hadn't tried them sooner. They're not 'race' friendly shorts, per se, but I'll be wearing them for the marathon this weekend.</p>
<p>On the latter, <a href="https://cieleathletics.com/">Ciele</a> make the best running hats. Full stop. End of. They're lightweight, machine washable, and look great.</p>
<p>In terms of others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of my running tees are Lululemon. They're a relaxed fit with a thicker fabric, which I don't believe they make any more.</li>
<li>Socks are important. I have some 'nicer' Balega socks, but find them a bit too thick. I often run in some basic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Multi-Pack-Ventilating-Comfort-Performance/dp/B08ZDPWYH8?sr=8-1">Saucony quarter socks</a>.</li>
<li>I like Tracksmith's <a href="https://www.tracksmith.com/products/m-session-shorts?sku=MB323401RB">Session shorts</a>, but struggle with the lack of storage/pockets. I'll reach for them when I'm <em>just</em> going for a run, but can't wear them, say, to drop off my son at school and then go for a run.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fueling-%26-hydration" tabindex="-1">Fueling &amp; Hydration</h2>
<p>When I first got started, I ran with Clif Bloks. I'd take one cube per mile. I've later learned this was likely insufficient fueling for my body composition.</p>
<p>These days, I use <a href="https://www.maurten.com/">Maurten</a>'s Gel 100 and Caf 100. I was a little wary of using actual gels, but have <em>loved</em> them. Easy on the stomach.</p>
<p>The downside, though, is that they don't have any electrolytes/sodium. For this weekend, I'm going to be bringing some salt tablets/capsules to consume every so often.</p>
<p>For longer training runs, I've used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MSZ5QYF">Osprey hydration pack</a> since 2023. The original bladder recently ruptured, but it was easy/inexpensive to find a replacement.</p>
<p>For shorter, I have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SJHK5LV?amp=">handheld bottle</a>.</p>
<p>I tried various belts and other tools, but found most of them to be awful. You may have a different experience.</p>
<h2 id="misc.-1" tabindex="-1">Misc.</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have a <a href="https://www.withings.com/uk/en/body-smart">Withings scale</a>. It's good.</li>
<li>I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nuun-Hydration-Electrolyte-Essential-Electrolytes/dp/B019GU4J56?sr=8-1">Nuun hydration tablets</a> for recovery.</li>
<li>I bought one of these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015D9VG14">gimmicky stretching tools</a>, but have actually found it to be quite helpful.</li>
<li>Chafing is a thing! I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Body-Glide-Original-Anti-Chafe-2-5oz/dp/B0779P1SBH?sr=8-1">this on my legs</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NipStrips-Solution-Distance-Adhesives-Guaranteed/dp/B00ELS0D7C?sr=8-1">wear these on my nipples</a> during long runs.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="4.-recommendations" tabindex="-1">4. Recommendations</h1>
<p>If you are considering running, a few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buy a decent pair of shoes</strong>. It'll make a world of difference. There's a lot of jargon out there and, at running shops, it seems likely you'll be pushed toward some stability shoes. Personally, I'd suggest a pair of shoes that could be described as being good for &quot;daily runs&quot; and &quot;neutral feet.&quot; Something like the <a href="https://www.newbalance.com/pd/fresh-foam-x-1080v14/M1080V14-47512-PMG-NA.html?dwvar_M1080V14-47512-PMG-NA_style=M1080L14">New Balance 1080 line</a>. They're relatively stable, soft, and versatile. It may be that you <em>need</em> stability shoes, but, for me, I fit all the criteria for stability shoes but have done much better in neutral shoes and building a stretching habit. A lot of undiagnosed issues have become much better as a result.</li>
<li><strong>Relatedly, make sure you get the right size shoe</strong>. This is embarrassing, but running helped me discover that I'd been wearing the wrong shoe size for most of my adult life. I had been buying US 9 shoes, but, turns out, I need to have 10-11.</li>
<li><strong>Run slowly</strong>. If you're anything like me, you'll be inclined to go fast. Burn as many calories as possible! But you'll be much better served by going consistently and slowly. Once you break through certain distance thresholds, it'll do a great service to your mental capabilities as a runner. You'll find yourself running those distances much more quickly in no time.</li>
<li><strong>Stretch</strong>. I got to this one much too late. But building a regular stretching habit will make an enormous difference to your running and general wellbeing. (Obvious, I know.)</li>
<li><strong>Sign up for a race (or a run club)</strong>. I've found it to be very helpful to have a race to work toward. I've generally always got two races on the calendar. After the 2025 marathon, I'm running the 'Big Half' later this year in London. I've never joined or participated in a run club. I prefer to run alone. But it's clearly a phenomenal way to meet people and train for longer distances, so would recommend it if you're inclined. If you're not, try an NRC guided run. Or work with a coach to help you get going.</li>
<li><strong>Don't expect to lose weight</strong>. I lost a lot initially and have remained roughly stable since. But, when you start running longer distances, you'll get <em>hungry</em>. The upside is that you can eat awfully and get away with it. The downside is that, if you're hoping to lose weight, it's not straightforward.</li>
<li><strong>Track the metrics. Or don't.</strong> Personally, I find it very motivating to dig into granular detail. Keeping track and monitoring trends has kept me really motivated. But I could totally see how it could play out differently. Do what's right for you.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="5.-conclusion" tabindex="-1">5. Conclusion</h1>
<p>This post is a mess, but I hope it's helpful to someone.</p>
<p>As someone who has never had a 'thing,' I'm so glad to have found running, albeit a little late.</p>
<p>I love the physical aspect, but the greatest gain has been mental. It's given me time and space to parse a lot of challenging things over the past few years. It's also helped me learn our new surroundings in the UK. And it's been a great way to connect with people.</p>
<p>Across both marathons, I've raised about £5,000 for the Jesuit Refugee Service and, this year, Children With Cancer. That's a good thing too.</p>
<p>It even helped with my relationship with my father-in-law. We always got along, but he — like me — discovered running in his mid-to-late thirties. (Unlike me, he went on to run over a dozen marathons and racked up a PR of 2:45 or so.)</p>
<p>He passed away in February unexpectedly. My mother-in-law a few days later. The last time I spoke to him was after setting a PR at the Farnborough Half Marathon, just a couple of days before his death.</p>
<p>He was always excited to talk about it. On my <a href="https://2025tcslondonmarathon.enthuse.com/pf/matt-alexander">marathon fundraise page</a>, you can even see an (anonymous) comment from him looking forward to discussing my 2025 result.</p>
<p>We won't have the chance, but he'll certainly be on my mind this weekend.</p>
<p>Anyway, you should go for a run! You might like it. You certainly won't feel worse for having tried.</p>
