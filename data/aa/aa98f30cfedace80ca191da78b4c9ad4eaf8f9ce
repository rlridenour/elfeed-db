<li>A glowing orb that can do <em>all</em> the colors</li>
<li>Control it with its app, Alexa, or Google Assistant</li>
<li>The perfect nightlight</li>
<li>Is it available in Georgia Red: Buddy, what about “<em>all</em> the colors” do you not understand?</li>
</ul><h1>Glow Your Own Way</h1><p>Looking through the product photos and videos for this BlissLights smart lamp, we came across one that, frankly, concerned us:</p>
<p><img height="970" src="https://d2b8wt72ktn9a2.cloudfront.net/mediocre/image/upload/v1750428391/eu8tzniqazygwdekytpb.png" width="1514" /></p>
<p>Now, you have to understand, this is a fundamentally different kind of BlissLights product than previous ones we’ve sold. In the past, we’ve offered an array of their projectors, whereas this is more of a nightlight. There’s no light show, is what we’re saying, only a soothing aura.</p>
<p>And yet, one of the charming things about BlissLights’ stuff is that much of it is plug-and-play. Turn it on, it makes cool light. Turn it off, it doesn’t. That’s all there is to it.</p>
<p>But this product, as shown in the above photo, can be controlled with an <em>app</em>. Or with <em>Alexa</em> or <em>Google Assistant</em>. It’s <em>smart</em>. It can be put on a <em>schedule</em>. You can use your <em>phone</em> to make it do <em>cool effects</em>.</p>
<p>Sure, all that’s neat and stuff, but it makes you wonder: is this a step towards something stupid? Are they gonna shove a bluetooth speaker in these things next? Or an essential oil diffuser?</p>
<p>Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p>For now, though, at least they’ve kept it simple <em>enough</em>. There’s an app and settings and all that. But it really is just a cool orb that glows in different colors.</p>
<p>And yet… pairing one of these with an essential oil diffuser wouldn’t be the <em>worst</em> thing, would it?</p>
<p>Ugh! We’re turning into what we hate!</p>
<p>Buy this cool nightlight thing if you want it.</p>
