<h2>How to Use Audio Sharing on iPhone and iPad</h2><br/>
Depending on the headphone model, there may be minor differences in the setup process of sharing audio, but they shouldn't diverge too much from the way of doing it with AirPods, which goes like this.<br/>
 <ol><li>With your AirPods connected and in your ears, start playing audio on your iPhone or iPad. </li><br/>
<li>If you have the Music app open and showing the media playback controls, tap your AirPods at the bottom of the screen. Alternatively, swipe down for <strong>Control Center</strong>, then in the audio playback controls panel, tap the icon in the top-right corner representing your connected AirPods.<br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Share Audio...</strong> below the playback controls. <br/>

<li>You should see a prompt on your device's screen offering to Share Audio. Now, bring your friend's AirPods, inside their case, close to your device, and flip the lid open. </li><br/>
<li>When your friend's AirPods are detected, tap <strong>Share Audio</strong>. <br/>

<li>Hold the button on the back of the AirPods charging case if requested.</li><br/>
<li>When you've successfully connected, the iPhone or iPad hosting the audio controls the volume level on both pairs of headphones, but both people listening can also use any headphone controls they may have to change volume independently.<br/>
