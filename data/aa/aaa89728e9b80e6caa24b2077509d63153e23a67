<p>David Heinemeier Hansson (last week):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to their fight for Fortnite, app developers everywhere are
now allowed to link out of apps to their own web-based payment
system in the US store (but, sadly, nowhere else yet).</p>

<p>This is all we ever wanted from Apple: to have a way to distribute
our iPhone apps and keep the customer relationship by billing
directly. The 30% toll gets all the attention, and it is
ludicrously egregious, but to us, it’s just as much about
<a href="https://www.hey.com/apple/iap/">retaining that direct customer relationship</a>, so we can help
folks with refunds, so they don’t tie their billing for a
multi-platform email system to a single manufacturer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/19/judge-pressures-apple-to-approve-fortnite-or-return-to-court/">Here’s Sarah Perez at TechCrunch</a>, the day prior to DHH’s announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Following the decision, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/apple-changes-us-app-store-rules-to-let-apps-redirect-users-to-their-own-websites-for-payments/">updated</a> its App Store
policies for the U.S., and apps, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/apple-approves-spotify-app-update-that-allows-u-s-users-to-access-pricing-info-external-payment-links/">Spotify</a>, Amazon
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/amazon-kindles-ios-app-adds-new-get-book-button-following-apple-payments-ruling/">Kindle</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/patreons-app-can-now-accept-web-payments-after-u-s-app-store-changes/">Patreon</a> quickly rolled out new versions
of their apps to take advantage of the new functionality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of these apps were using Apple’s in-app payments. Users simply couldn’t sign up for paid tiers (or in Kindle’s case, buy books) from inside the apps. This is a win for users, and Apple won’t lose a cent from commissions from any of these apps.</p>
