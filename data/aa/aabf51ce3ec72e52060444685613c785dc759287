Apple calls this feature "Music pins," and it'll let you pin playlists, albums, and artists at the top of your Library tab.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; is also gaining lyrics translation and lyrics pronunciation, so that it's easier to listen to and appreciate music from all over the world.<br/>
