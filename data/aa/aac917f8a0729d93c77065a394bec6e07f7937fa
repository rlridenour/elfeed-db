<li>Finally, chalk that you can drink!</li>
<li>Wait, no, you can’t drink it</li>
<li>You can draw with it</li>
<li>Easy to clean with some surface cleaner and a cloth</li>

</ul><h1>Back To The Drawing Board</h1><p>Everyone, get pumped. To get a few pumps. Of that sweet, sweet syrup. <a href="https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte-psl-returns-august-26/">From the mouth of the green mermaid herself</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PSL fans can mark their calendars for the unofficial start of fall on August 26 when the iconic Pumpkin Spice Latte, made with real pumpkin, will return to Starbucks coffeehouses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, yes. The end of August, just when we’re all excited for fall flavors. Nothing like warming spices and squash when it’s about 92 degrees in the shade.</p>
<p>But more problematic than the timing is the cost.</p>
<p>I was recently enticed by the sign next to my grocery store Starbucks advertising something called an horchata oatmilk shaken espresso. Given that I love both horchata and espresso, I decided to treat myself while I shopped and ordered a grande, using a $5 gift card I had to pay.</p>
<p>And then I used my debit card to pay for the remaining TWO DOLLAR BALANCE, because this was, apparently, a 7-dollar cup of sweet coffee.</p>
<p>Ridiculous, right?!</p>
<p>Especially because you can make your own pumpkin spice lattes at home. All you need is a way to make espresso, some milk (oat or otherwise), and maybe a good pumpkin spice syrup, such as this one that people like from <a href="https://abeautifulmess.com/psl-syrup/">A Beautiful Mess</a>.</p>
<p>But the one thing you probably don’t have at your house?</p>
<p>The intricate chalkboard art of, like, a cornucopia or something.</p>
<p>Luckily, we can help. With this set of liquid chalk markers.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been to an overpriced chain supermarket or an overpriced chain coffee shop and wondered, <em>How did they manage to draw such a beautiful picture using only chalk</em>?, the answer is: these things.</p>
<p>They allow you to draw and write easily on chalkboard surfaces and can be erased without issue using a bit of surface cleaner and a cloth.</p>
<p>Obviously, we’re being a bit tongue-in-cheek about making your own Starbucks at home to save money during PSL season. But these things are pretty cool.</p>
<p>So buy them, maybe?</p>
