Disney is eliminating the standalone Hulu app, reports <em><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/hulu-app-phased-out-disney-plus-fully-integrating-1236480450/">Variety</a></em>. Rather than separate Hulu and Disney+ apps, Disney plans to offer a unified streaming app that includes both services.<br/>

The new app will debut in 2026, and while it will include both Disney+ and Hulu, customers will still able to buy standalone subscriptions to each service.<br/>
<br/>
"The company is taking major steps forward in streaming with the upcoming launch of ESPN's direct-to-consumer service, our just-announced plans with the NFL, and our forthcoming integration of Hulu into Disney+, creating a truly differentiated streaming proposition that harnesses the highest-caliber brands and franchises, general entertainment, family programming, news, and industry-leading sports content," Disney CEO Bob Iger said of the plan during the company's third quarter earnings call.<br/>
<br/>
Iger claims the combined app will provide an "improved consumer experience" and new opportunities for advertising revenue.<br/>
<br/>
Disney+ and Hulu have a combined 183 million paid subscriptions, up 2.6 million since last quarter.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/">Disney Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/">Hulu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/disney-merging-disney-plus-hulu/">Disney is Nixing the Standalone Hulu App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-is-nixing-the-standalone-hulu-app.2462905/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
