Google recently came out with the Pixel 9a, a mid-tier Android smartphone that rivals the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> that Apple released earlier this year. We picked up a Pixel 9a to see how Google's lower-cost option compares to Apple's more affordable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>

<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="What the iPhone 16e SHOULD Be (Google Pixel 9a vs iPhone 16e)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dd7tGoQ-XdY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The Pixel 9a joins the flagship Pixel 9 and 9 Pro smartphones that Google released last year, much like Apple added the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup. The Pixel 9a is priced starting at &#36;499, so it's &#36;100 cheaper than the &#36;599 starting price of the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; and the Pixel 9a don't look all that different, and both feature a minimal design with aluminum frames, a matte back, and a smaller camera setup than the flagship smartphones. The Pixel 9a has a plastic back instead of a glass back, so it's a little less premium but more durable.<br/>
<br/>
While the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; has a protruding single-lens rear camera, the Pixel 9a has an almost flush camera bump with two lenses instead of just one. There's a standard 48-megapixel wide-angle lens, and a 13-megapixel ultrawide lens, while the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is limited to a 48-megapixel wide lens. The Pixel 9a and the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; both take solid images, and it's tough to tell the difference between them in most situations.<br/>
<br/>
Google wins out when it comes to portrait mode images because of the better depth of field and the people limitation on the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, but Apple wins for video because the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has some of the best video stabilization features available in a smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
As for display, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; has thinner bezels and a higher resolution, but the Pixel 9a has 120Hz refresh rate support and an always-on display, features you won't get with the 16e. Android smartphone makers still can't match <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> even after all this time, so the Pixel 9a also has a fingerprint sensor.<br/>
<br/>
You're probably not going to run into performance issues with either smartphone, though the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; may be better at high-performance games. The Pixel 9a unsurprisingly outperforms the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; when it comes to AI, because Apple's AI features are just so far behind. Gemini is better than <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Pixel Studio beats <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>. Google does better at object removal in photos, and there are useful features for choosing the best image, adding people to a photo, and more.<br/>
