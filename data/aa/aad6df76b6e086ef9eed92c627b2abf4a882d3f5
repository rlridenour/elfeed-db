<p>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with AI tools for a while now, and I&#8217;ve settled on Claude as my primary assistant. After spending time with ChatGPT, Gemini, and others, <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> just feels right to me.</p>



<p>What draws me to Claude is how the conversation flows. When I&#8217;m working through a problem or trying to get something done, the responses feel natural and aligned with what I&#8217;m actually trying to accomplish.</p>



<p>The company behind Claude, Anthropic, seems focused on building AI that handles the busy work so you can focus on the creative stuff. That&#8217;s exactly the use case I care about.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not interested in AI that writes my blog posts or creates my presentations. I want AI that handles the tedious tasks that eat up my day. Claude gets that distinction, and it shows in how they&#8217;re building the product.</p>
