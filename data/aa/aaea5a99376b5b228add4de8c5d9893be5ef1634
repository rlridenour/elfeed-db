So sometimes I need to join a few lines by a separator while I&#39;m coding, for example, turn the below lines,</p>
<div class="src src-text">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">foo
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">bar
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">baz</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
into <code class="verbatim">foo + bar + baz</code>. (This is a silly example, I will update if I come up with a better one :-P )</p>
<p>
When I was in a rush in the past, I usually baked a keyboard macro temporarily and then applied it to achieve this goal, thought reliable, it&#39;s a little bit cumbersome to record it. So I wonder maybe it would be a good idea to have a command for it.</p>
