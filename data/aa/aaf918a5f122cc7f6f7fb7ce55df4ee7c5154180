<p>Given current events, the importance of having a shared and testable truth is arguably the only thing that matters these days. A time-honored practice to reaching such truth is to write and distribute documentation with good references.</p>
<p>Emacs has long had support for BibTeX, <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1987/6006.html#:~:text=http://www2.eecs.berkeley,and%20a%20draft%20making%20facility.">going as far back as 1987</a>. <a href="https://bibtex.eu">BibTeX</a> is both a bibliography processor for <a href="https://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a> documents and more importantly, a database schema for bibliographic data. The significance of the latter allows for using a BibTeX database for contexts outside of LaTeX.</p>
<p>BibTeX organizes bibliographic data into a collection of records (or entries) that are stored in a plain-text file (multiple files are also supported). This plain-text file is identified using a “.bib” suffix and is treated as a database. Any plain-text editor can edit a BibTeX file. This can be seen, especially with 2025 eyes, as a virtue or an anathema. Because the BibTeX database is just a plain-text file, schema enforcement ultimately rests upon the user editing the file.</p>
<p>The Emacs built-in package <code>bibtex</code> tries to help shoulder this schema enforcement by providing commands for both navigating and editing BibTeX data structures (entries and the fields within an entry). In this way, <code>bibtex</code> tries to provide the user a quasi-“form-based” interface to editing a BibTeX file.</p>
<p>Like many other Emacs modes, I find the commands for <code>bibtex-mode</code> to be difficult to both discover and recall. I also find <code>bibtex-mode</code> to not be opinionated enough in trying to provide a form-based experience.</p>
<p>To address this, I’m happy to announce the latest <a href="https://melpa.org/#/casual">Casual</a> addition: support for <a href="https://kickingvegas.github.io/casual/BibTeX.html">BibTeX</a>.</p>

<p>Casual BibTeX organizes <code>bibtex</code> commands into a Transient menu. The bindings remap conventional Emacs navigation bindings for field or entry navigation. Casual BibTeX holds the strong opinion that creation, update, or deletion of either an entry or a field should be done via commands dedicated for those respective operations. Using manual editing of the BibTeX file to achieve the same end is discouraged.</p>
<p>If you are invested in Org, knowing how to work with BibTeX has great benefit as Org has <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Citation-handling.html#Citation-handling">extensive citation support</a> for it.</p>
<p>Casual BibTeX is now available in the <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/releases/tag/2.9.0">v2.9.0 update of Casual</a> on <a href="https://melpa.org/#/casual">MELPA</a>. Learn more about Casual BibTeX in its <a href="https://kickingvegas.github.io/casual/BibTeX.html">documentation</a>.</p>
