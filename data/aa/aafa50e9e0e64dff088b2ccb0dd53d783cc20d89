<p>President Trump said he may approve supplying long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine if Russia does not end its war, making any transfer conditional on Moscow’s actions [thehindu.com#1][bbc.com#1][lemonde.fr#1]. His remarks followed a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky, who described the conversation as &quot;very productive&quot; and said it focused on strengthening Ukraine’s air defense, resilience, and long-range capabilities [dw.com#1][lemonde.fr#1]. The discussion came after Russian attacks on Ukraine’s power grid overnight, part of an ongoing campaign to degrade energy infrastructure before winter [pbs.org#1]. The Kremlin has previously warned that U.S. deliveries of long-range missiles would seriously damage relations and represent a major escalation, and RT reported Trump acknowledged such a shipment would be a &quot;step of aggression&quot; toward Russia [thehindu.com#1][rferl.org#1][rt.com#1]. Kyiv, for its part, has said any Tomahawks would be used only for military targets, and Trump has asked to understand how Ukraine would use them before approving a transfer [straitstimes.com#1][ndtv.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Pt3xAUpoWTnhVEoabzFlSzAduGaLCB0IM7SbXWpQpMNZwg2R_IMrdU7siqKJZ02ytTSdSAzeRT7sfxF3k98TmmlRMx9NIHVZtWMhvJK1wHD70UBG5AY6XRXrb2ylUnLiwO77uHr1M7TbcjbKOQ7xxZmkoekeY-GXq5c4qor49Ntz1wc2YPuAeo0O2eWZ0IKJXZn0cFSjEV1NCDPvKRLlgobBHWNOerCXJaTf0wd7pTVizo2Tgq6M-8TWwLNR-TPjvfQF9mFyaA7HhTrgJEJTxJqepzcQBZdjAXj4JPD_ahcG--ASCGQ' alt='A dummy Tomahawk land attack missile is seen onboard HMS Artful at Barrow-in-Furness shipyard in northern England, March 13, 2014.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Conditional delivery: Trump linked any Tomahawk shipment to Russia ending or &quot;settling&quot; the war, saying he may approve them if the conflict continues [thehindu.com#1][bbc.com#1][lemonde.fr#1].</li><li>Leaders’ call: Zelensky called his conversation with Trump &quot;very productive&quot; and highlighted plans to bolster air defenses, resilience, and long-range capabilities [dw.com#1][lemonde.fr#1].</li><li>Kremlin warning: Putin has warned that supplying long-range missiles would seriously damage U.S.-Russia relations and be a major escalation [thehindu.com#1][rferl.org#1].</li><li>Usage assurances: Zelensky said Ukraine would use any Tomahawks only for military purposes, while Trump has asked Kyiv to explain planned use before approval [straitstimes.com#1][ndtv.com#1].</li><li>Conflict context: Trump’s comments came after overnight Russian strikes on Ukraine’s power grid aimed at crippling energy infrastructure ahead of winter [pbs.org#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States (President Trump): He signaled he may approve Tomahawk transfers to Ukraine if Russia continues the war, tying the decision to Moscow’s actions.
