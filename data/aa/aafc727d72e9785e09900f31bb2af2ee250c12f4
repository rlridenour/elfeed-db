<li>99 tasty little bars</li>
<li>A perfectly disappointing trick-or-treating snack</li>
<li>We don’t have many left</li>
<li>Best By 1/24/26 or 3/6/26 (your choice, for a price)</li>
<li>What does KIND stand for: Kinda Interesting Natural Delights</li>
</ul><h1>Supply and Demand</h1><p>So, let’s just get the facts straight:</p>
<p><strong>Fact The First</strong></p>
<p>We sold these earlier this month.</p>
<p><strong>Fact The Second</strong></p>
<p>In the copy for that sale, we stressed that these things were just okay. Like, not amazing, not terrible, a totally fine thing to put into your face when you’re feeling a little peckish.</p>
<p><strong>Fact the Third</strong></p>
<p>Despite the first two facts, we’ve upped the price by 5 bucks this time around.</p>
<p>So… what gives?</p>
<p>Did some new, better reviews come in?</p>
<p>Actually, yeah. They did. And that might’ve been our doing. Perhaps we undersold the bars so much last time that people felt it was their duty to speak up on KIND’s behalf.</p>
<p>Such as <a href="/@tommytoad0">@tommytoad0</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I bought these here before and they lasted me a long long time. I would take one to my almost daily medical treatments. Even long after their “expiration” they were totally fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="/@kuoh">@kuoh</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My peanut butter bars arrived today and sat in the sun for a few hours, promptly melting the chocolate chips. They were very soft, but still tasted great, my only regret was not ordering more than 1. These will be great to replenish my emergency office snacks stash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, even with a bit of melt, they tasted “great”? What an amazing turn!</p>
<p>But, actually, the reviews have nothing to do with the $5 increase. No, our reason for cranking up the price: we sold a fuck ton of these things last time. Like 3,148 units. Plus, an additional 3,344 on Morningsave. And that means, we don’t have too many left.</p>
<p>Hence, the price jack is an example of a very advanced-level business concept known as ‘supply and demand,’ which is something we all learned about at Harvard Business School, the college that everyone who works at Meh went to.</p>
<p>In short: don’t hate the player, hate the game.</p>
<p>But also, it’s still 99 bars for $25. In other words: the best price you’re going to find just about anywhere.  And still the best price if you choose to pay $5 more for the later-dated batch.</p>
<p>Will you bow down at the altar of capitalism? Or will you punish us for this blatant act of price-gouging?</p>
<p>Tell us with your dollars.</p>
