<p>In honor of the occasion, I invite those who have authored or edited an open access book in philosophy to share it in the comments here, with a link to where it is available.</p>
<p>Open Access Week is organized by <a href="https://sparcopen.org/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SPARC</a>, a nonprofit advocacy organization that supports open systems for research. According to them, the week</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>is an opportunity for the academic and research community to continue to learn about the potential benefits of Open Access, to share what they’ve learned with colleagues, and to help inspire wider participation in helping to make Open Access a new norm in scholarship and research.</em></p>
<p>So, authors and editors, list your open access books. Reflections on the experience and effects of publishing an open access book are welcome, too.</p>
