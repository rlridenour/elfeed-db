The hub is similar in size to a hockey puck, and it includes a magnet so it can be attached to the back of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or to a magnetic <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> case. Along with a USB-C port that offers up to 100W of passthrough charging, Satechi's adapter has the following ports:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>HDMI 4K/60Hz</li><br/>
 	<li>USB-A (5Gb/s)</li><br/>
 	<li>USB-A (5Gb/s)</li><br/>
 	<li>SD card reader (up to 104MB/s, up to 2TB)</li><br/>
 	<li>microSD card reader (up to 104MB/s, up to 2TB)</li><br/>
 	<li>Gigabit Ethernet</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
With the magnetic connection, the adapter can be connected to the back of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and used to access storage on an SD card or connected USB-A storage device. The adapter is compatible with iPhones, iPads, Macs, PCs, Android devices, and more.<br/>

For devices that don't have an included magnet, there is an adhesive ring to attach the adapter to the product, keeping it out of the way. Satechi includes a braided USB-C cable that wraps around the adapter.<br/>
