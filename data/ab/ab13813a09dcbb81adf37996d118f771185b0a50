Brian Hogan has <a href="https://newsletter.bphogan.com/archive/issue-45-markdown-is-holding-you-back/">a post</a> that I, at least, find provocative. His thesis is that Markdown—and by extension, Org-mode—are holding you back because they&rsquo;re not semantic. That&rsquo;s true, in a way, I guess, but both Markdown and Org-mode are <i>Markup languages</i>. That means they&rsquo;re concerned with producing publishable content: they consider what things look like on the printed page or the screen.
</p>
<p>
They are, in their way, semantic languages in that they specify what grammatical object is being described. Markdown, and especially Org, can use that information to display the item in a manner appropriate for the output target. Of course, Hogan wants a stronger sense of semantic where the markup describes higher order meanings such as &ldquo;step in a process&rdquo; instead of simply &ldquo;a bullet item&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that that always ends in tears. It ends, in short, in abominations like XML. XML is, in fact, what Hogan really wants but even he knows it&rsquo;s a horrible solution beloved by exactly no one. Still, he says, it&rsquo;s necessary because otherwise it&rsquo;s too hard for AI agents and the like to discern the meaning of the markup.
</p>
<p>
Forgive me for saying that that&rsquo;s not my problem. My problem is producing a nice looking document that human beings can read, understand, and enjoy. If AI companies want to get rich by training their AI agents on my content, it&rsquo;s certainly not incumbent on me to make their job easier.
</p>
<p>
And by the way, why doesn&rsquo;t Hogan mention Org-mode. It does, after all, meet a lot of his requirements, have a single definition, and allows the easy—for some definitions of easy—specification of backends that can be semantically aware.
</p>
<p>
So, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines">Betteridge&rsquo;s Law of Headlines</a> insists, no, Markdown is not holding us back. I understand Hogan&rsquo;s views to the contrary and I certainly don&rsquo;t accuse him of bad faith but I fail to see how Markdown or Org-mode is holding us back in any meaningful way.</p>
