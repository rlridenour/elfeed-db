<p>Learned today (thanks to <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/">Simon Tatham</a>) that there are 2 different ways the mouse&rsquo;s scroll wheel can work in the terminal:</p>
<ol>
<li>if the application (like <code>less</code>) enables the alternate screen buffer, then scroll events are <code>ESC O A</code> or <code>ESC O B</code> (like pressing the up and down keys)</li>
<li>if mouse reporting is on, scroll events are reported to the program like other mouse events, as button press 4/5, with the coordinates of where your mouse was included</li>
</ol>
<p>(as well as the default where your terminal emulator will just scroll the terminal window without telling the program that you&rsquo;re scrolling)</p>
<p>This makes sense in retrospect because:</p>
<p>a) I&rsquo;ve noticed that some TUI programs (like lazygit) have multiple areas and you can scroll each area independently with the mouse, which &ldquo;feels&rsquo; like it would have to use mouse reporting&rdquo; (and it does)
a) it felt weird to me that <code>less</code> would support mouse reporting and indeed it doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is that useful in practice but it&rsquo;s kind of interesting that
sometimes the scroll wheel is just another way to press arrow keys really fast
and sometimes it acts more like a GUI scroll wheel.</p>
