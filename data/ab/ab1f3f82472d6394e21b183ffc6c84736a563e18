<blockquote>
  <p>While Verizon had a good few months, with the last major outage
occurring in <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/live/verizon-october-outage-live-blog">October 2024</a>, it seems that the popular
United States wireless carrier is having some issues. So, if
you’re on Verizon and seeing ‘SOS’ in place of network bars,
you’re not alone.</p>

<p>Countless users have taken to social platforms like X (formerly
Twitter) and Threads to shout issues, but reported problems with
Verizon have spiked on Down Detector to over 46,000.</p>

<p>This outage matters, because I’m on Verizon and my phone hasn’t had a signal for two hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/TMobile/status/2011520811035750711">T-Mobile, on Twitter/X</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>T-Mobile’s network is keeping our customers connected, and we’ve
confirmed that our network is operating normally and as expected.
However due to Verizon’s reported outage, our customers may not be
able to reach someone with Verizon service at this time.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/ATT/status/2011528734898294969">AT&amp;T, in such a hurry to pile on that their punctuation was slapdash</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our network? Solid. If you’re experiencing issues, it’s not
us.....it’s the other guys. Some things are just out of our hands!
- BUT if you’re interested in giving us a try — https://att.com/wireless/free-trial/</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Full point awarded to T-Mobile for the better, colder, burn.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Service returned for me around 5pm, but <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/live/verizon-outage-january-2026">the outage wasn’t completely resolved until 10pm ET</a>. Yikes.</p>
