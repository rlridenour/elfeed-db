Ruoming Pang, who manages Apple's foundation models team, is moving from Apple to Meta. He was in charge of a team with approximately 100 employees that work on Apple's large language models. Models developed by Pang's team are used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features like email summaries, Priority Notifications, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>.<br/>

Meta lured Pang with a deal worth tens of millions of dollars per year. Meta has also scooped up AI experts from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Scale AI.<br/>

Rumors suggest that Apple has been considering relying on technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/">from Anthropic or OpenAI</a> for a future LLM version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, rather than using the models it has been working on. Those discussions have reportedly impacted the morale of the foundation models team that Pang is leaving. Other engineers on the team are also mulling offers from other companies.<br/>

Apple's AI efforts are now being overseen by Apple's software chief Craig Federighi and Mike Rockwell, who led Vision Pro development.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/apple-ai-executive-leaves-for-meta/">Apple Loses Key AI Executive to Meta&#039;s Multimillion-Dollar Hiring Spree</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-loses-key-ai-executive-to-metas-multimillion-dollar-hiring-spree.2461158/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
