<p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, this year’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate, surfaced publicly in Oslo after more than a year in hiding and a secret journey out of Venezuela despite a long‑standing travel ban. She arrived too late for Wednesday’s Nobel ceremony, where her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado, accepted the prize and delivered a speech condemning what they described as &quot;state terrorism&quot; and rights abuses under President Nicolás Maduro while insisting that democracy is essential for peace. Emerging onto a hotel balcony in central Oslo in the early hours of Thursday, Machado waved, sang Venezuela’s national anthem with supporters and thanked unnamed people who she said had risked their lives to help her reach Norway. She has vowed to return to Venezuela and pledged that the country &quot;will be free,&quot; even as Maduro’s government has warned she could be arrested and labelled a fugitive if she goes back. The award and her trip have energized many Venezuelans who see the prize as international recognition of their struggle, though some opposition figures and citizens worry that her departure from the country may weaken her on-the-ground leadership or expose her to greater legal risk.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/nDz8D-T3MQpMkbdbOhTuB9gbw8-II2QU7lc38ovSv5HEv6vVqYI6Dh74jVZ25Q4PmpNEjIdPVZX6MpbMGNq4k2o-Jz-f-ny9j1RAkBXN4nyz' alt='Nobel peace laureate María Corina Machado greets supporters from the balcony of the Grand Hotel in Oslo after arriving from Venezuela.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Secret sea escape: Several outlets report that Machado slipped out of Venezuela by boat on a journey the Nobel Institute described as involving &quot;extreme danger,&quot; though specific details remain undisclosed to protect those who helped her leave.</li><li>Daughter’s message: At Oslo City Hall, Ana Corina Sosa read her mother’s acceptance speech, insisting that her mother &quot;will never give up&quot; on a free Venezuela and portraying the Nobel as recognition for millions of Venezuelans seeking democratic change.</li><li>Nobel committee’s rationale: The Norwegian Nobel Committee said it chose Machado for her &quot;tireless work in promoting the democratic rights of the Venezuelan people&quot; and her efforts for a peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.</li><li>Mixed reaction at home: Some Venezuelans praised Machado’s trip as a way to amplify their cause internationally, while others feared that leaving the country could distance her from everyday struggles or provide the government with a pretext to brand her a fugitive.</li><li>Risk of arrest: Caracas authorities have signalled that Machado violated a decade‑long travel ban and could face arrest if she returns, a step analysts say the government has so far avoided because detaining a Nobel laureate would carry heavy symbolic costs.</li></ul><blockquote>I am hopeful Venezuela will be free. - María Corina Machado</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>María Corina Machado: Machado has vowed to try to return to Venezuela and said she wants to end what she calls the &quot;tyranny&quot; in her country while insisting that Venezuela &quot;will be free.&quot;.
