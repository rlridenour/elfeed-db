<p>Last week I wrote about avoiding social media, and I got a lot of responses. But several of you pointed out that your real problem isn&#8217;t Twitter-type apps or Instagram. It&#8217;s YouTube.</p>



<p>You go there to watch one video about fixing your bike tire, and three hours later you&#8217;re watching someone restore a 1987 Nintendo. I get it. YouTube is sneaky that way.</p>



<p>So here&#8217;s what works for me.</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Create a watch list.</strong> YouTube lets you save videos to custom playlists. When you stumble across something interesting, don&#8217;t watch it. Just add it to your watch list and close the tab.</li>



<li><strong>Schedule your YouTube time.</strong> Pick a specific block in your week. Mine&#8217;s Friday afternoons. When that time comes, open YouTube and go straight to your watch list. No homepage. No recommendations feed. Just your list.</li>



<li><strong>Use the algorithm, but on your terms.</strong> I actually like YouTube&#8217;s recommendations. They surface videos I wouldn&#8217;t find otherwise. The trick is treating them like suggestions, not commands. See something interesting? Add it to the list. Move on.</li>



<li><strong>Curate ruthlessly.</strong> Before I start watching, I scan my list and delete anything that doesn&#8217;t grab me anymore. What seemed interesting on Tuesday might feel skippable by Friday. That&#8217;s fine.</li>
</ol>



<p>This is time boxing in action. You&#8217;re not eliminating YouTube. You&#8217;re just deciding when and what to watch before you start watching. It turns passive consumption into an active choice.</p>



<p>Does it eliminate the temptation completely? No. Sometimes I still fall down a rabbit hole. But having a system makes those slip-ups rare instead of routine.</p>



<p>The key insight is that YouTube isn&#8217;t the problem. The infinite feed is. Your watch list gives you the benefits of YouTube without the trap of endless autoplay.</p>



<p>Give it a try for a week and see what happens.</p>
