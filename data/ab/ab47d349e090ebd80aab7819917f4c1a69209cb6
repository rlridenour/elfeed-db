Do you feel overwhelmed with a head full of thoughts without time to think about useful things? It is time to clear your head.</p>
<p>
Preparation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have pencil and paper ready.</li>
<li>Make sure you&#39;re in a quiet place without danger to be disturbed before reading on.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a simple yet powerful way to get all those plans and ideas that are buzzing around in your brain all day long under control. These thoughts are constantly distracting you, preventing you from making short- and long-term plans.</p>
<p>
The truth is: they can&#39;t help it, it&#39;s you that haven&#39;t decided anything about them that will make them keep nagging you. What you need is a reliable external system to get them out of your head.</p>
<p>
One of these systems is David Allen&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> (GTD) system. But it takes at least a month to read the book and start making this method our own. We don&#39;t have that long right now.</p>
<p>
There a huge issues with all those loose ends circling both in your head and heading your direction from the outside world. You will be reminded of the stupidest things at the least expected moment. Even worse: don&#39;t do anything about them, and they will finally just disappear. Too bad, because while most ideas have no future value, some of them are real gems. One of them might even change the world. </p>
<p>
So make sure you do something with those gems! How? Read on!</p>

Clear Your head: Start Writing
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Grab that pen and paper that have so patiently been waiting next to you (or even better, use <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/getting-things-done-with-emacs/">Emacs Org Mode</a>). During the next ten minutes, you will start to write down everything that&#39;s in your head. Try not to <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/myth-of-multitasking/">multitask</a> but fully focus your attention non the list.</p>
<p>
This exercise will range from small actions that need immediate attention up to big future projects whose impact you cannot yet even fathom. It doesn&#39;t matter what it is, once it&#39;s written down it will be out of your head. Things you might encounter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cleaning up the backyard</li>
<li>Find a good school for my kid</li>
<li>Improve my job skills</li>
<li>Learn how to use <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/publishing-with-org-mode-export/">Emacs instead of Word for writing ebooks</a></li>
<li>Write an ebook about … (fill in your speciality)</li>
<li>Update your daily administration</li>
<li>Empty your e-mail inbox</li>
<li>Prepare presentation for quarterly meeting next week</li>
<li>Get XYZ project back on track with Isaac and Charlie</li>
<li>And so on, and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&#39;t spend any time thinking about those weird things you&#39;re jotting down. What you&#39;re going to do with them later is irrelevant now. By the way, did you notice that most things on the list above, apart from items 6 and 7, are bigger things than just one action? In GTD-speak they&#39;re called projects, all “desired outcomes that take more than one action to complete” or goals. Goals are good, but can not be acted on immediately. They need to be made more specific and normally follow the route from defining projects first and actions later.</p>
<p>
Now start writing. Take your time and keep writing, until your head is empty. If ten minutes of frantic writing is not enough, hold on. Later you&#39;ll thank yourself! OK, there we go, I&#39;m waiting for you …</p>
<p>
Ready? When everything went according to plan, you now have an impressive list in front of you. Full of actionable items, projects and the more fuzzy goals. With less than 30 points you either have an extremely laid back life or cheated. In the latter case: maybe write a little more? Until the number approaches 50 or even 100 you&#39;re probably not done yet. This only works if your head is clear of every loose end you will know when you&#39;re done.</p>
<p>
What you have achieved now is that everything is in a trusted system outside your head. Now it comes down to the most important thing: <em>doing</em> something with this information. First look at things that can be done in one step: your actions. These go on an action list, to be done the moment you are ready for them. The rest of your items are either projects or goals. Put them on two separate lists, and keep them current. In the future, these lists make it easier for you to focus on what&#39;s requiring your attention now (projects) and to check whether your actions are in line with where you&#39;re heading in life and work.</p>

Getting Things Done—Bonus Tip
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Overwhelmed by a huge project list? Do not shoot the messenger! ;-) this is all your stuff. Who says you are required to complete the entire list? Take a critical look at the projects that don&#39;t give energy and that you can eliminate without risk of getting in trouble. Be honest, there&#39;s more to be deleted than you think. You are your judge.</p>
<p>
A waste of time, all this list making? On the contrary! You have found a way to get those loose ends out of your head. This will give a tremendous amount of energy and focus. From now on you&#39;re doing only things that are important to YOU. It&#39;s hard to come up with a better time saver than that, I&#39;d say.</p>
<p>
Good luck clearing your head. Did it work? Share your experiences below.</p>
