Sometimes it seems <br></br>
like the world <br></br>
is filled <br></br>
with a darkness <br></br>
that threatens <br></br>
to shatter our lives <br></br>
and destroy all hope,
</p>

 <p>
but as our eyes <br></br>
are opened in worship <br></br>
we see that this darkness <br></br>
is but a shadow that flees <br></br>
as the light of Christ <br></br>
comes into the world.
</p>

 <p>
May your light shine upon us, <br></br>
may it shine in us, <br></br>
may it shine through us.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
