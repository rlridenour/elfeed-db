<p>Italian officials are seeking clarification after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel were reported to be joining security efforts tied to the U.S. Olympic delegation at the Milan-Cortina Winter Games in early February. U.S. officials said the ICE presence would not involve immigration enforcement in Italy and would instead support risk-vetting and protective work alongside the U.S. State Department and Italian authorities. The episode has triggered a public debate in Italy, with some leaders strongly objecting because of ICE’s recent conduct in the United States, while others argue the agents’ role is narrow and largely behind the scenes.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Z2PHo3lCuX-5J1wD4_eFaMH53t3ymPx1tvypcoxxWaWDqX8hzpQyOEYvuEkeNYNE_CNe2As16HjHqcfZkMZwJ38RNnId-LyNhXJTljyphpoKFy4xG6zXHRWkpNnBNruNRyxj2BdixkvkSmKLrfR5X33die0fIyZbnM3qmeCa8JwznScd1e6JDObyP42VyMoaebNoDxzE7dp8-Rw8Ge2OWkB485uTTjjngvZ-3jr_P2QV1h2Gg3W1tRi-LiLIq_6svyy2ET8yXUSz0DjSwafK3g_aSZNeU8GZb1ovbWOyqPHxxNy7YytF9ppFHogenGZmTdMWT5ygNF9pj8g-L1QDkqbxnESbPMhHkxQTXpG0HELXN3xGy8dBh-HLJsP6A6oQy_GD6pYiweTep4hLwMfYAcwOPqy3PJiylRpIqL5YFq_UCMzKWMDMhCS-r12BLdT8paYmbJWhAM30vu_w6TzRV8IAMYUOuds2fA2MOsS0zjGVOw' alt='Reporting on U.S. ICE personnel supporting security tied to the U.S. delegation at the Milan-Cortina Games.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Italian limits: Italy’s interior minister said U.S. federal agents would operate only within U.S. “diplomatic premises,” as Rome sought to calm domestic concerns over sovereignty and policing.</li><li>Security scope: DHS said ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations unit would help vet and mitigate threats from transnational criminal organizations, with all on-the-ground security remaining under Italian authority.</li><li>Local outrage: Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala publicly condemned ICE’s involvement, saying the agency was “not welcome in Milan,” reflecting anger among some current and former Italian leaders.</li><li>US context: NPR linked Italian objections to anger over a recent Minneapolis incident involving ICE agents, which has heightened scrutiny of the agency’s tactics back home.</li><li>Past precedents: U.S. federal agents have participated in security roles at previous Olympic Games, a point cited by officials portraying the deployment as routine support for delegations.</li></ul><blockquote>Obviously, ICE does not conduct immigration enforcement operations in foreign countries - Tricia McLaughlin</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Italian government (interior ministry): Italy says the U.S. agents’ work will be confined to U.S. diplomatic premises rather than street-level policing.
