<p>Preliminary results from Honduras’ presidential election show conservative National Party candidate Nasry “Tito” Asfura with a narrow advantage over rival Salvador Nasralla as authorities tally a partial count of ballots cast on Sunday. The National Electoral Council reported that Asfura holds just over 40% support with votes from a little more than four in ten polling stations processed, indicating a close contest in a polarized political climate. The race has drawn unusual attention abroad after President Trump publicly endorsed Asfura days before the vote and warned that the United States could cut financial aid to Honduras if his preferred candidate lost. Trump also said he would pardon former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who is serving a lengthy prison sentence in the US on drug trafficking charges, injecting US–Honduras relations and questions about corruption and sovereignty into the campaign’s final stretch.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/M06kL8ti7c-0inPg59_tDY3sIOHHPXxdiXK9nMYaESAZ5wNAqLH4lFayOC7BexA8c9cpIQtYpDqOCMKI8HKVfqya9V40MQVF6WmoSa5AMRvonbQx8-Jy35wCkAFnUZ5dUol0-Lu7iMvi3BLzqBZTN_kmkxTzNHvcpqC2Iz5TYo52shb0yjPqkdIfGm_uqvDTg41oGXEezm4JjieUbHzVO_VDQUXHtkYEITeLVD8' alt='Presidential candidate Nasry Asfura speaks to supporters in Tegucigalpa as early results show him narrowly ahead.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Two conservatives leading: Preliminary tallies show both Asfura of the National Party and TV host-turned-politician Salvador Nasralla, running with a different party banner, ahead of other contenders, signaling that Honduran voters may return a right-leaning government after a period of leftist leadership.</li><li>Election marked by distrust: Local and international coverage describes the vote as taking place amid deep public skepticism of institutions and strong political polarization, with the electoral authority emphasizing that results remain partial while final tallies are verified.</li><li>US aid as leverage: Reports note that President Trump’s suggestion of cutting US assistance if Asfura loses has turned development and security aid into a central electoral issue, raising debate in Honduras over external pressure versus national decision-making.</li><li>Pro-Israel party stance: Asfura’s National Party has maintained a strongly pro-Israel foreign policy in recent years, a point highlighted in Israeli press as one reason the race is closely watched in Jerusalem.</li><li>Potential volatility concerns: Analysts quoted in some reports warn that the combination of a tight margin, lingering distrust from past Honduran elections, and high international visibility could make the post-election period sensitive, even as authorities urge calm while counting concludes.</li></ul><blockquote>Hondurans are choosing their future in a context of great polarization and uncertainty - Unnamed analyst quoted by El País</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Nasry &quot;Tito&quot; Asfura: Asfura has campaigned as a businessman-style manager focused on stability and employment, positioning himself as a continuity figure for conservative voters while promising to address crime and economic hardship..
