<blockquote>
  <p>Earlier in their presidency, Denmark had revived a controversial
provision in the draft law that would mean online platforms — such as messaging apps — could be served with mandatory CSAM
detection orders, including services protected by end-to-end
encryption. However opposition from several other EU countries
derailed any agreement in the Council.</p>

<p>Today, Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard told local press
that the Council presidency would move away from mandatory
detection orders — and instead support CSAM detections remaining
voluntary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sanity prevails.</p>
