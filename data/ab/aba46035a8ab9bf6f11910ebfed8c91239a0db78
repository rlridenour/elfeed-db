<p>Charles Craik of Weston-super-Mare received this enigmatic postcard from a friend in 1901 and sent it on to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/StrandVolume22/page/n117/mode/2up?view=theater"><em>Strand</em></a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>
I think it rather cleverly done, and it took me some time before I could understand its meaning.</p>
<p>The principal message is on the big island in the centre of the map &#8212; an invitation to meet the sender at a café, with the day. The name of the island below on the left-hand side is at once translated, &#8216;If so, do.&#8217; The names of the land at the bottom of the map are meant for &#8216;Same time and place as before&#8217; and &#8216;Don&#8217;t let anything hinder you&#8217; respectively.</p>
<p>The following is a translation beginning at the top and working to the right: &#8216;Straights of cash. If you don&#8217;t come, all sorts of ills befall you. Come early. Let me know if you can come or not. I say, there&#8217;s a peculiar thing! You&#8217;re getting it by degrees. Can&#8217;t you see? Bay rhum. Get your hair cut! Deuced bad straights. See you later. Don&#8217;t you see? Devil take you. You are a merry cus! Good old flipper. Love to all. Oh! Tut, tut. R.S.V.P. Yours ever, Guy.&#8217;
