<p>A US military operation in Venezuela on Jan. 3 resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, an action that analysts and commentators say also aimed to send a deterrent message to China about US influence in the Western Hemisphere. Several accounts frame the raid as a setback for Beijing’s interests and prestige in Latin America and as a demonstration of Washington’s ability to disrupt Chinese strategic ambitions in the region. A different view argues that China’s position in Latin America is grounded less in diplomacy and more in trade ties and economic dependence, which military or diplomatic pressure may not undo quickly.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/aVtz3kLeYPiY1oQ7vpZxpZ-J03HOSf6TlLahDTKT8-J9YznfOS6jq6uPGii978OmLMRbd1OpUkDnLrKmVp8lRCmngpE4xDNXUkauXW69mhb-y2Q12vXD9wdkMYwIxwQ37tTyrxnDrsmtAnq4CRtRCRfO2SBi9xWdp5z_CL6UNyEZ997A5dd66UfY6sWqim_orG8Y' alt='US President Donald Trump welcomes Argentine President Javier Milei at the White House on Oct. 14, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Western Hemisphere signal: One explanation offered is that President Trump sought to reinforce a &quot;stay away from the Americas&quot; message to Beijing through the Venezuela operation, treating it as part of broader US-China competition beyond Asia and Europe.</li><li>Trade as leverage: An opposing analysis says China’s influence in Latin America primarily runs through commerce—deepening dependencies created by trade—making it harder for Washington to &quot;drive China out&quot; using pressure alone.</li><li>Prestige and interests: Another account describes the raid as damaging to China’s regional &quot;interests and prestige,&quot; suggesting reputational consequences in addition to any immediate political fallout inside Venezuela.</li><li>Influence limits: One commentary argues the Maduro capture highlights limits to Beijing’s long-term influence in Latin America and underscores Washington’s capacity to counter Chinese strategic ambitions in the region.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US-aligned strategic framing: The Venezuela raid and Maduro’s capture served as a warning to China to keep away from the Americas and showcased Washington’s willingness to use force to protect its regional dominance.
