<p>A video shared on President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account included an apparently AI-generated clip that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as primates—imagery widely condemned as racist. The post was later removed after backlash. The White House later said a staffer had “erroneously” posted the video, after press secretary Karoline Leavitt first dismissed the criticism as “fake outrage” and framed the content as an internet meme. Asked about the post, Trump said he had directed aides to share the video but hadn’t seen the segment with the racist depiction. He declined to apologize. The episode drew criticism from both parties, including prominent Republicans such as Sen. Tim Scott and Sen. Roger Wicker. Democratic leaders, along with former Vice President Kamala Harris, also condemned the post and the White House’s explanation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/FjhHlUzTwx5BGyDRWx6UtAlerfeYfDALzqjmFn_GhgpzA1Es_8itBVmvfFrpsXFn8Q-G4YiP2s0zie-76cjT8tIzEb87lOxMFcy85I3zyCm4tOSI3lDD-TFKjz9yAbGbVWqBJ_WKqCUP18jDR3XoyqShySk_9QRvFBYmzr367ygc43G6' alt='Donald Trump and Barack Obama speak at Jimmy Carter’s state funeral in Washington in January 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>What was shared (more detail): Reports said the post boosted election-fraud and voting-machine conspiracy claims, then ended with a jungle sequence showing the Obamas’ faces superimposed on primates bobbing to “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”.</li><li>Republican reaction (more specific): Sen.
