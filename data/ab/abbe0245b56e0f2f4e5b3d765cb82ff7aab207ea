<br/>
Starting with iOS 26, the Powerbeats Pro 2's heart rate monitoring feature will work with Apple's Fitness app on the iPhone, according to a Beats spokesperson. With the earbuds, you will be able to track your heart rate and calories burned across 50 different workout types in the Fitness app, with no Apple Watch required for this.<br/>

Apple Fitness+ subscribers with Powerbeats Pro 2 will be able to view real-time performance metrics directly on their iPhone, such as heart rate, calories burned, and the Burn Bar, without wearing an Apple Watch.<br/>

<li>Powerbeats Pro 2 count steps taken when your iPhone is not on you.</li><br/>
<li>Powerbeats Pro 2 and Apple Watch can simultaneously provide heart rate data.</li><br/>
<li>Siri Interactions on Powerbeats Pro 2 will let you nod your head yes, or shake your head no, when Siri asks if you want to answer an incoming call, hear a text message, manage notifications, and more.</li><br/>
<li>A new algorithm offers faster heart rate reading.</li><br/>
<li>A notification will prompt you to potentially improve the fit of your Powerbeats Pro 2 to improve heart rate reading.</li></ul>The latter two improvements will extend to Android.<br/>
