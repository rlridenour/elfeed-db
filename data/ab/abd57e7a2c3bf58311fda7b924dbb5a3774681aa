<p>Alexandra Steigrad, reporting for The New York Post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new publication will be headquartered in Los Angeles and
feature a robust staff of editors, reporters and photographers
dedicated to covering news, entertainment, politics, culture,
sports and business — all with a distinctly California
perspective.</p>

<p>The California Post will be supported by the team in New York
providing national and international news. The content will appear
in a daily print edition and will have its own dedicated homepage
for Californians with stories being published across multiple
other platforms, including video, audio and social media.</p>
