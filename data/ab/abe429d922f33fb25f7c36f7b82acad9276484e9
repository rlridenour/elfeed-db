One liner with ghostscript GS to make your pdf much smaller. Options for PDFSETTINGS are (in rank of output quality):
 /prepress /ebook /screen  gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=compressed_PDF_file.pdf input_PDF_file.pdf En Masse Compression: 972M -&gt; 457M I applied this with a script upon my 972M directory of hundreds of research pdfs, and the end result was less than half the size (457M). I converted each PDF to text, which is useful for most of them, and then moved each PDF to an &ldquo;uncompressed&rdquo; directory, then compressed that uncompressed/FILE.
