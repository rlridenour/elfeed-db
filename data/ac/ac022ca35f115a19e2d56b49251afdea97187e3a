<p>Claudette Colvin, a US civil rights pioneer whose teenage act of resistance helped challenge segregation, has died at age 86, according to announcements cited by multiple outlets. Colvin was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white passenger in 1955—months before Rosa Parks’s better-known protest. In later years, she succeeded in having her juvenile arrest record expunged, a step supporters described as long-overdue recognition of her role in history.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lLl3oAs7AkJzc1BUDxtoQPEGoByqzjX3-Y4hm2y-ZY2SZvbZTGAiOo9WnjzR6n_Op9edJ9YpWzGll3bPNXmbqou2TyvF0Gth6QQoDpxWyXDfsCDlOAz9bsIzxHslHIYx9BY2ib8PpeYGf1JNcIQhzOGLaG8vDG-z1Bz_E2_T9pmCzMZE7OwjiOOg5U6YUvCN1FhY-vHqJ-Yy4YxiwlGNpxncDgqioytxAZwKq8XB0rgZhw2DH2J-tW9vGA' alt='Claudette Colvin sits for a portrait in New York on February 5, 2009.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Aged 15: Colvin was 15 when she was taken into custody after the bus incident, highlighting how youth played a direct role in early civil rights challenges.</li><li>Classroom context: Le Monde reports Colvin had been studying Black history in school on March 2, 1955, before the confrontation on the bus.</li><li>Legacy framing: Her foundation said she left a legacy of courage that helped change American history.</li><li>Her own words: DW notes Colvin later described her resolve with the line: &quot;History had me glued to that seat&quot;.</li><li>Modern remembrance: Al Jazeera described Colvin as an &quot;unsung&quot; pioneer whose arrest helped ignite the modern civil rights movement.</li></ul><blockquote>History had me glued to that seat - Claudette Colvin</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Claudette Colvin’s foundation: The foundation said Colvin’s 1955 stand left a lasting legacy that helped reshape US history.
