<p id="p2">Tomorrow is Apple&rsquo;s big day, but today is ours. We&rsquo;re pleased to introduce you to a brand new podcast, and more of one of your favorite shows.</p>
<h2 id="first-last-everything"><a href="https://macstories.net/podcasts/first-last-everything" rel="noopener noreferrer">First, Last, Everything</a></h2>

<p id="p4"><a href="https://macstories.net/podcasts/first-last-everything" rel="noopener noreferrer">First, Last, Everything</a> is a brand new MacStories podcast that explores people&rsquo;s relationships with the technology that has shaped their lives. Each week, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/author/jonathan/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Reed</a> &ndash; who is a regular contributor to MacStories Weekly, our Club community manager on Discord, and the author of our annual watchOS reviews and other stories &ndash; gets to know a guest through three pieces of tech:</p>
<ul id="ul5"><li>the one that first inspired them,</li>
<li>their latest obsession, and </li>
<li>the thing that&rsquo;s meant everything to them.</li>
</ul><p id="p6">From apps and computers to weird gadgets and more, Jonathan and listeners get to know someone from the unique perspective of the technology they love. Plus, in each episode, Jonathan shares an aside about a bit of technology you may have never heard of during the &lsquo;Something&rsquo; segment.</p>
<p id="p7">Jonathan is a great interviewer and has a fantastic slate of guests lined up for season one of First, Last, Everything. You&rsquo;ll hear new perspectives from familiar voices as well as brand new ones. Gadgets are fun, but it&rsquo;s the people who use them that bring them to life through their stories. If you&rsquo;re curious about technology, how others use it, and how new perspectives could inform your tech use, First, Last, Everything is your kind of show.</p>
<p id="p8">First, Last, Everything is a seasonal podcast, with new episodes releasing every Tuesday throughout the season. Season one includes eight episodes that will take the show well into the fall. Then, after a brief break, the podcast will be back with a new slate of interviews.</p>
<p id="p9">As someone who cares a lot about the human side of technology, I&rsquo;m absolutely in love with this show. Federico and I dabbled with <a href="https://dialogpodcast.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">a similar concept</a> years ago, so I&rsquo;m really happy to see Jonathan putting his own spin on the idea and bringing together such a great lineup of guests that I&rsquo;d love to spoil for everyone but will keep as a surprise.</p>
<p id="p10">You can listen to the first episode with YouTuber Tom Hitchins, whom, coincidentally, Federico and I hung out with a lot at WWDC this year, today. You can find Tom on his YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ByteReview" rel="noopener noreferrer">Byte Review</a>, or his website, <a href="https://kirokustudio.co.uk" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiroku.co.uk</a>, where he&rsquo;s making calm, aesthetic videos about Apple products, creating wallpapers and Lightroom presets, and selling stickers and other great products. I think you&rsquo;ll love the interview.</p>
<p id="p11">As we&rsquo;re fond of saying, you can get First, Last, Everything wherever you get your podcasts. The show is still rolling out across the Internet, so it may show up in some places before others, but you can always visit <a href="macstories.net/podcasts/first-last-everything" rel="noopener noreferrer">macstories.net/podcasts/first-last-everything</a> for links to the show on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Pocket Casts, Spotify, and good, old-fashioned RSS. Plus, you can follow the show on <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@flepodcast" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/flepodcast.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a>.</p>

<p id="p14">We&rsquo;re equally excited to bring you <a href="https://macstories.memberful.com/checkout?plan=138191" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cozy Zone</a>, a members-only extension of Comfort Zone hosted by <a href="https://www.macstories.net/?author=52" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Birchler</a>, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/author/nileane/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nil&eacute;ane</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Lawley</a>. It was a no-brainer to add Comfort Zone to MacStories, and the reaction from listeners has been beyond our expectations. It&rsquo;s the perfect blend of information and entertainment sprinkled with the hosts&rsquo; weird obsessions.</p>
<p id="p15">In each weekly bonus episode of Comfort Zone, Matt, Nil&eacute;ane, and Chris invite listeners to join them in the Cozy Zone, where they&rsquo;ll cover extra topics, invent wilder challenges and games, and share all their great (and not-so-great) takes on tech. The show is an excellent way to get to know the hosts better and participate in the fun you already enjoy on Comfort Zone. Here&rsquo;s the trailer.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper" id="div16"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Welcome to Cozy Zone (It&rsquo;s Comfort Zone, but Cozier.)" width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nE-3QSO98TM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p id="p17">The first episode of Cozy Zone is being released publicly so everyone can get a taste of it right now. You&rsquo;ll find it today in the <a href="https://feeds.libsyn.com/531557/rss" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comfort Zone feed</a> and on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDSpdP6G2mHuQfDP4-fM8XQxLYmc90xNi" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>. Going forward, Cozy Zone will be audio-only for now, but if we hear from enough listeners who want it, we&rsquo;ll work on making video versions a regular option, too. The first episode is available to watch here:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper" id="div18"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Cozy Zone, Episode 1: Defend Your Desk (Bonus Episode)" width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmiKtHCCX4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p id="p19">Episode 1 of Cozy Zone is available in the Comfort Zone audio-only podcast feeds too.</p>
<p id="p20">You can get cozy with the Comfort Zone crew for just <a href="https://macstories.memberful.com/checkout?plan=138191" rel="noopener noreferrer">$5/month</a> or <a href="https://macstories.memberful.com/checkout?plan=138195" rel="noopener noreferrer">$50/year</a>, which not only makes the bonus episodes possible, but supports Comfort Zone, too. The gang has already recorded the first few episodes, and they&rsquo;re great. We think you&rsquo;ll love them as well. To keep up with Cozy Zone, be sure to follow the existing Comfort Zone accounts on <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@comfortzone" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/comfortzone.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p id="p21">Finally, thanks to everyone who reads MacStories and listens to our shows. It means a lot to us. We have no shortage of ideas of ways we can make MacStories even better than it was yesterday or is today, but without you all reading, listening, and spreading the word about what we do to your friends and family, it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible. The MacStories community is strong and the kind of foundation that has allowed us to weather fundamental shifts in the online media world. Thank you for all you&rsquo;ve done and continue to do for MacStories.</p>
