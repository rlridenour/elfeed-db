<p>If you pay any attention at all to the Apple-centric web, you saw an explosion of links yesterday to <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/">this article</a> by Nikita Prokopov, which rightly eviscerates the proliferation of menu icons in macOS 26. I may write up my thoughts on menu icons in a future post (short version: they don’t belong), but today I have something else on my mind. Like Prokopov’s post, it addresses the question, “Why the fuck has Apple forgotten the UI principles it knew forty years ago?”</p>
<p>If you’re using CarPlay and ask for directions, you’ll see a screen that looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="CarPlay with alternate routes in Maps" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2026/20260106-CarPlay%20with%20alternate%20routes%20in%20Maps.png" title="CarPlay with alternate routes in Maps" width="100%"/></p>
<p>That the default route’s Go button is gray while the alternates are green is a stupidity addressed by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sageolson/115574876728650307">Sage Olson</a> and <a href="https://duck.haus/@joesteel">Joe Rosensteel</a><sup id="fnref:toot"><a href="#fn:toot" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, so I won’t bother.</p>
<p>What I will address is that whichever route you choose, you have to tap its Go button. Even though the full description of each route looks like a button, the only part that’s tappable is the part that looks like a button inside another button.</p>
<p>Is this just as stupid as having a dull color as the default and a bright color as the alternate? Yes. And Apple has known that descriptions should be click/tap targets since the very beginning of the Mac. Here, courtesy of <a href="https://infinitemac.org/1984/System%201.0">Infinite Mac</a>, is MacWrite 1.0 running on a simulation of an original Macintosh.</p>
<p><img alt="MacWrite Find window in Infinite Mac" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2026/20260106-MacWrite%20Find%20window%20in%20Infinite%20Mac.png" title="MacWrite Find window in Infinite Mac" width="100%"/></p>
<p>I’ve brought up the Find window. It’s currently set to do a Whole Word search, but I can switch to a Partial Word search by clicking on the Partial Word radio button <em>or anywhere on that button’s label</em>. Even with a label that doesn’t look like a button, Apple knew it would be helpful to select the radio button if I clicked on its label. After all, what else could I possibly mean if I clicked on the word Partial?</p>
<p>Apple understood this in 1984. But now, in 2026, if I’m driving and ask Siri for directions to <a href="https://dnr.illinois.gov/parks/park.starvedrock.html">Starved Rock State Park</a>, CarPlay doesn’t understand what I mean if I tap in the middle of either of those large gray buttons-that-aren’t-buttons.</p>
<p>Why, you may ask, would I even consider tapping outside the Go button? <em>Because Apple has trained me for forty years to expect that I can tap on its label.</em></p>
