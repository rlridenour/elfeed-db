Álvaro Ramírez <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-elevator-pitch">has weighed in on</a> the <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/08/01/emacs-carnival-2025-08-your-elevator-pitch-for-emacs/">Emacs Elevator Pitch challenge</a>. Like <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13191">Randy Ridenour&rsquo;s response</a>, Ramírez captures the spirit of the challenge perfectly. His answer is, to be sure, much longer than Ridenour&rsquo;s but it&rsquo;s easy to imagine it actually being delivered in an elevator.

Ramírez begins by saying that although Emacs seems like just an editor, it is, in fact, a portal to a world where everything works the way you want it to. He goes on to illustrate his point by presenting a long list of many of the things he&rsquo;s done with Emacs. It&rsquo;s a lengthy list. Just barely short enough to fit in a multi-floor elevator ride.

One of the things I liked about his list was that most of the items contained a link to the blog post that described that particular feature and how he implemented it. If you&rsquo;re interested in small projects that leverage Emacs to accomplish some nominally non-editing function, Ramírez&rsquo;s post serves as in index into those he&rsquo;s done.

Finally, at the end of his post, Ramírez injects a bit of humor that neatly captures the absurdity of trying to make a case for Emacs in the time span of an elevator ride. Still, the challenge is interesting because it forces you to distill your reasons for loving Emacs to its essence.
