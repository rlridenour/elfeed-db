<p>It usually arrives out of nowhere. A person claiming to work for a domain registration center or network authority says another company wants to register your brand name as several .cn domains &#8211; maybe example.cn, example.com.cn, example.net.cn, and so on.</p>



<span id="more-8353"></span>



<p><em>They make it sound urgent, official, and protective:</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;We have received an application from another company to register your brand as their domain name. Please confirm whether this company is related to you.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A few days later, another message may follow &#8211; supposedly from that other company, insisting they will go ahead unless you stop them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s really happening</h2>



<p><strong>It&#8217;s a coordinated scam.</strong><br>The senders pretend to be a Chinese registrar or business contact, but they&#8217;re not connected to any legitimate organization. Their goal is simple:<br>to make you anxious enough to buy .cn domains through them at a high markup.</p>



<p>They sometimes use <strong>real company names</strong> and addresses to look credible, but they have nothing to do with the actual businesses they mention.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Red flags to recognize</h2>



<p>There is no global approval process for .cn domains. Anyone can register one through a real registrar.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Internet keyword&#8221;</em> is an outdated concept that no real service uses anymore.</p>



<p>The language is always urgent: &#8220;This is very important,&#8221; &#8220;Please forward to your CEO,&#8221; &#8220;We are waiting for your approval.&#8221;</p>



<p>The emails usually come from non-official domains or generic addresses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to do</h2>



<p><strong>Do not reply.</strong> Any response confirms your address is active.</p>



<p>Mark it as spam or phishing.</p>



<p>If you actually want the .cn domains, register them yourself through a known registrar such as Gandi, Namecheap, Alibaba Cloud, or Tencent Cloud.</p>



<p>No one can take your main domain. Your .com, .net, or .org address is unaffected.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why this scam still works</h2>



<p>It plays on fear &#8211; the fear of losing your name or brand. The email feels official enough to make a small company owner react quickly. But domain ownership doesn&#8217;t work that way. There&#8217;s no approval process, and no registrar will ever email you asking for permission about a name you don&#8217;t own.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The takeaway</h2>



<p>If someone contacts you claiming another company wants to register your .cn domain, relax.<br>It&#8217;s not a threat &#8211; it&#8217;s a sales trick. Ignore it, mark it as spam, and carry on building your site.</p>
