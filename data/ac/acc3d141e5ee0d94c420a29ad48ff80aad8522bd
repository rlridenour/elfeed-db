The Gemini app has been compatible with both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; since it launched, but until the latest update, using it on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; showed an iPhone-sized interface. The latest version of Gemini adds &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; optimization, plus it includes an option to add a Gemini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> widget, and integration with Google <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>.<blockquote>What's New<br/>
- Gemini now has a full-screen, optimized iPad app<br/>
- Gemini can now be added as a homescreen widget<br/>
- Gemini can now connect with your Google Photos library<br/>
- UI improvements and bug fixes</blockquote>The Gemini app for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; allows users to access Google Gemini AI. Gemini connects to Google apps like Search, YouTube, Gmail, and Google Maps, plus it has research capabilities, the ability to generate images, study tools, and an option for brainstorming ideas.<br/>

Gemini is free to use, but Gemini Advanced, a more capable version of Gemini, requires a Google One AI Premium subscription. Google One AI Premium is priced at &#36;19.99 per month, which is competitive with similar plans from Anthropic and OpenAI.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gemini/">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/07/google-gemini-app-gets-ipad-optimization/">Google Gemini App Gets iPad Optimization</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-gemini-app-gets-ipad-optimization.2456686/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
