<p>The cardiologist explained the test results to me.
The stress test was excellent, no surprise there. With low blood pressure and a healthy heart, I can keep running and exercising.</p>

<p>My Carotid Artery Doppler Exam though (ultrasound scan for the arteries in the neck) was a different story. If I didn&rsquo;t have a family history, I can imagine he&rsquo;d maybe say that we&rsquo;ll watch it before we start with medication.</p>

<p>But I do have a family history, and the plaque is there. I was expecting this with my last blood test results. So medicine it is.</p>

<p>My feelings are mixed. There&rsquo;s worry and some sadness, but I prefer it over stupid (and dangerous) ignorance. A sense of commitment and responsibility toward my exercise routine. There&rsquo;s also a sense of purpose I need to explore, to see where it leads and from where.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already given up cheese, and I can&rsquo;t remember how many years ago I gave up milk. Chicken and fish are probably next (I have given up other meat a long time ago).</p>

<p>The real challenge, I think, is to find something to eat in restaurants and in social settings. But this NYC, home to many vegans. One more won&rsquo;t make much of a difference.</p>
