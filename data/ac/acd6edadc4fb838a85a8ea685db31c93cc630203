JTR over at <a href="https://taonaw.com">The Art Of Not Asking Why</a> has a <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/11/17/104334.html">useful reminder</a> about something that I, at least, always forget about: <code>org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift</code>. The idea is that you have something scheduled on a certain day but want to repeat that event regularly. You can add a <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Repeated-tasks.html#index-repeated-tasks">repeater</a> to the entry that will repeat it at fixed intervals. For example, if you have a weekly meeting on Friday at 10 AM you can add an entry for that meeting and the repeater <code>+1w</code> and the task will appear every Friday.
</p>
<p>
You can also clone an entry a given number of times. For example, suppose you have a class everyday at 8 AM for 3 days. You can make an entry for the first day and then use <code>org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift</code> to add two more entries on subsequent days.
</p>
<p>
Scheduling events with Org mode really is a lot more flexible than you might imagine. The <code>org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift</code> function is an example. You can take an existing entry and clone it any number of times at any given fixed interval. It&rsquo;s <i>much</i> easier than trying to do this by hand.
</p>
<p>
There are, of course, some nuances so be sure to take a look at the Docstring for the function.</p>
