<p>President Trump said the United States is sending an “armada” of ships toward the Middle East “just in case,” while saying he would prefer not to use force as Washington monitors Iran amid widespread unrest. A senior Iranian official warned that Iran would treat any attack—no matter how limited—as an “all-out war” and said the country is on high alert as additional US military assets, including a carrier strike group, are expected in the region. The reporting highlights sharply different accounts of the unrest’s human toll, with activists cited by The Guardian putting deaths at 5,002, while Iranian official figures cited by RT say more than 3,000 have been killed, including nearly 700 people the government labels “terrorists”.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/VQGM_ucV4rbLkzHJ_kfxXSnVUkksvWkoaARnnuPygh42G6KaTKJ3xRD9I5Hp2ZUa4SRnLmHkHApqBl-gXk3mJp53JIDU4YrRlTUrDOF7yfXX' alt='An Iranian flag is pictured near a missile during a military drill in Iran (Reuters file photo, October 2020).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Davos context: President Trump made the comments aboard Air Force One while returning from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</li><li>Warning details: The Iranian official said Tehran views the US buildup as a sovereignty issue and declined to spell out what retaliation would look like if Iran were attacked.</li><li>Nuclear emphasis: President Trump paired the naval warning with renewed cautions to Tehran about restarting its nuclear program and about the treatment of protesters.</li><li>Airline disruptions: Amid heightened regional tensions, Air France suspended service to Dubai and KLM halted Middle East flights, according to Dawn’s report.</li><li>Pentagon unknowns: RT reported the Pentagon had not confirmed President Trump’s description of fleet movements at the time of publication.</li></ul><blockquote>We have a lot of ships going that direction, just in case. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US President Donald Trump: Says the US is sending many ships toward the region as a precaution while stressing he would rather avoid action.
