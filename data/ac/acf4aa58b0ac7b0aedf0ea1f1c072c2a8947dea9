<p>The incident I&rsquo;m about to tell you about happened a few weeks ago, but life is busy, so I&rsquo;ve only just got around to writing about it. Prepare yourself for The Tale of the Train Seat Incident!</p>
<p>I get the train to and from work these days because of the whole ME, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/no-bounce-in-my-bungee/">lack of bounce in bungee</a> situation. On this occasion, I was returning from work on a busy train, and ended up in the section of the carriage intended for wheelchairs, pushchairs and so on. There are foldable seats (like cinema seats but less comfortable) on either side to accommodate people sitting in them with a pushchair, or they can remain folded up for people to park their wheelchairs in the space. The seats are attached to the carriage wall on either side, so occupants travel sideways, looking out of the opposite window. I&rsquo;m not keen on this, but on a busy train, any seat is better than none.</p>
<p>A woman with a large pushchair was on one side, and I (with a few others) was sitting on the other side. There was a baby in the pushchair. He was about 9 months old I think, but I&rsquo;m bad at guessing the age of babies. He was leafing through what I think is called a &lsquo;busy book&rsquo; or &lsquo;quiet book&rsquo;. The pages were made of fabric, and the one he was focusing on was covered with colourful ribbons which you could weave together and then fasten down with poppers (snaps for my North American readers). He was giggling happily to himself about the hilarious poppers. Fair play to him, it looked like an entertaining book, and I was slightly jealous that he had ribbons to weave and secure down with poppers and I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>His enthusiastic book jiggling dislodged a teddy from his pushchair, which fell on the floor on the side furthest from his mother and nearest to me. I don&rsquo;t think she saw it go, and she couldn&rsquo;t have reached it anyway as she was blocked in by the pushchair. So I bobbed up out of my seat, scooped up the teddy and handed it back to her, before sitting down again.</p>

<p><em>Attentive readers, I am sure that you are way ahead of me here and can &mdash; like poor, un-listened-to Cassandra before you &mdash; foresee the terrible catastrophe that is about to occur.</em></p>

<p>I was only a pace away from my seat so stepped back, sat down, and&hellip; to my genuine surprise found myself slipping past the now folded-up seat back and landing heavily with my butt on the train floor. As my neighbour in these treacherous seats helped to haul me back up again, and I picked up what was left of my dignity from the floor, I thought to myself, &ldquo;At least I&rsquo;ll have given the little lad a good laugh.&rdquo; This whole situation seemed to me to be premium physical comedy/pratfall material of the kind that kids generally love. Someone falling unexpectedly on their backside? Comedy gold.</p>
<p>I was therefore disconcerted to be met with the most serious and disapproving stare I think I have ever seen in one so young. It&rsquo;s an expression that I find hard to describe precisely even now, but if I had to sum it up in two words it would be: ABSOLUTELY NOT.</p>
<p>Obviously, when one has witnessed such a shocking breach of decorum, one cannot simply resume one&rsquo;s perusal of one&rsquo;s busy book, so for the rest of the journey (which wasn&rsquo;t long, but felt like eternity), every time I looked up, he was still staring directly at me with exactly the same expression. I have rarely felt so relieved to get off a train.</p>
