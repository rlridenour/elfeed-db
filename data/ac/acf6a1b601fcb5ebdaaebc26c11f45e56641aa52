<blockquote>
  <p>But far less recognized is that Drexel made the very bold decision
of committing all students to purchase a previously unreleased and
untested computer from Apple. This was, of course, the Macintosh
(introduced in January 1984), which was unlike any previous
computer. Drexel’s commitment to the Mac was also of great benefit
to Apple, helping to legitimize this brand-new platform, which
helped make the Mac a successful product that continues to thrive
in education 40 years later.</p>

<p>This entire initiative, called the Drexel Microcomputer Project,
was captured in a 1-hour documentary filmed by David Jones, Dean
of the Pennoni Honors College from 2008 to 2014. The film
premiered at Drexel in 1985.</p>

<p>I was very fortunate not only to know Dave Jones (who <a href="https://drexel.edu/news/archive/2018/October/Sad-News-on-the-Passing-of-Former-Dean-Dave-Jones">died in 2018</a>) but to have him as a professor for several film criticism courses (one on westerns, and another on the works of Alfred Hitchcock). I was a computer science major, not a film major, but Jones didn’t care. He was also familiar with — dare I say, a fan of — my column in <a href="https://www.thetriangle.org/">The Triangle</a>, Drexel’s student newspaper. He took me to lunch my senior year and encouraged me to pursue writing as a career. He was a great teacher: thoughtful, kind, insightful, open-minded, and deeply knowledgeable.</p>

<p>I saw a screening of <em>Going National</em> back in 2011, and sat on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-vCnurOBf8">a panel discussion with Jones to talk about it</a>. It’s a good documentary, and he really captured the feel of Drexel’s campus at the time. It is a very <em>’80s</em> movie. It was gratifying that I got to tell him, then, that his advice to me back in 1996 had worked out pretty well.</p>
