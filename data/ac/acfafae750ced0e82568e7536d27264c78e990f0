For years my workflow has centered in org-agenda and I would go from one clocked item to the next. For instance, I would be clocked into my &ldquo;Emails&rdquo; task, which never closes, and then eventually move down in the agenda to &ldquo;Task B&rdquo;. Then I hit C-x TAB to clock in. It correctly queries for a comment on the task I&rsquo;m leaving but no longer clocks me in to the new task as I&rsquo;d asked.
