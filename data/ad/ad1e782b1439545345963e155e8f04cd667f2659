iOS 26.4 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/">expected to introduce a revamped version of Siri</a> powered by Apple Intelligence, but not everyone is satisfied with how well it works.<br/>
<br/>

In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-19/apple-m5-ipad-pro-vision-pro-macbook-pro-impressions-review-touch-screen-mac-mgxnn1w8"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said some of Apple's software engineers have "concerns" about the overhauled Siri's performance. However, he did not provide any specific details about the shortcomings.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26.4 will likely be released in March or April, so Apple still has around five to six months to improve any lingering issues with the voice assistant.<br/>
<br/>
When it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">first previewed the new Siri</a> at WWDC 2024, Apple said it would have three main capabilities: on-screen awareness, personal context, and in-app controls. For example, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans, based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.<br/>
<br/>
The new Siri was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-powered-siri/">initially expected to debut with iOS 18.4</a> last year, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">Apple delayed it</a>. In July, Apple CEO Tim Cook said his company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/tim-cook-shares-personalized-siri-update/">was making "good progress"</a> on the more personalized Siri, and he said the features were on track to launch next year. However, if issues persist, then even an iOS 26.4 launch might not be guaranteed.<br/>
