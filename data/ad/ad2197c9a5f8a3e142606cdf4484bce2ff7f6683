Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro will have a starting price that is &#36;50 more than the iPhone 16 Pro but it will come with a minimum 256GB of storage, doubling the base capacity compared to last year's model. The information comes from Chinese leaker Instant Digital, <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PFCi1stYT">posting on Weibo</a>. The account, which has 1.5 million followers, has now made the claim three separate times in recent weeks.<br/>

Currently, the iPhone 16 Pro starts at 128GB storage for &#36;999, while the 256GB version costs &#36;1,099. By contrast, the larger iPhone 16 Pro Max already begins at 256GB for &#36;1,199. Both Pro models offer up to 1TB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
Before the launch of the iPhone 15 series in 2023, there were rumors that the iPhone 15 Pro Max would drop the 128GB tier and start at &#36;1,199, up from &#36;1,099 for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The rumor proved accurate, but only because Apple eliminated the lower storage option, effectively raising the entry price.<br/>
<br/>
Apple may be preparing a similar shift for the iPhone 17 Pro. A new 256GB base model could be priced at &#36;1,049, replacing the 128GB model at &#36;999. Rather than a straightforward &#36;50 price hike, this move could be perceived by customers as better value, offering more storage for only a modest increase – and simplifying the lineup in the process.<br/>
<br/>
In July, Jefferies <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/30/iphone-17-price-increase-expected/">reported</a> that Apple plans to raise prices across the iPhone 17 lineup by &#36;50, citing higher component costs and tariffs related to China. Instant Digital echoed this expectation in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/will-iphone-17-pro-start-at-256gb-storage/">previous post</a>. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/apple-considering-price-increases-iphone-17/">reported</a> that Apple is considering raising prices for its upcoming ‌iPhone 17‌ models.<br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital has shared accurate Apple information before, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">Yellow iPhone 14 launch</a>, iPhone 15's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/">frosted glass back</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/">spatial video</a> on iPhone 15 Pro, M4 iPad Pro's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-to-gain-matte-option/">nano-texture display</a>, and iPhone 16 Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-16-pro-battery-capacities/">battery specs</a>. Their claims are therefore worth taking seriously.<br/>
