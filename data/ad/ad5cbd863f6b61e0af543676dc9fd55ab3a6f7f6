I am obsessed with autocompletion in shell mode. Running a shell in shell-mode instead of a terminal emulator has so many advantages. You can treat the whole buffer just like a normal Emacs buffer. You can copy and paste and edit the line normally. You can hook it into native Emacs functionality. You can even display images!
However there is one big disadvantage. You lose access to the state the shell.
