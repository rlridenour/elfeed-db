<p>Syria’s government announced an immediate ceasefire deal with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) after roughly two weeks of clashes and rapid government advances in contested northeastern areas. The agreement includes integrating the SDF into state institutions and the Syrian army, a move the government says helps reassert state control across most of the country. Reports describe administrative and military handovers that would shift key areas and resources—along with responsibilities like managing Islamic State detainees—to Damascus, while talks between Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and SDF leader Mazloum Abdi were expected to follow.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/nYSiDA7DwcnLbt1fT7Pt5XSYwILSariBnAHt5u3E5PFTczMzsVPdLVCl0hiQcMSwx5UEaGAknKeaTO4dB7E0eXVGCzMBLxDoxDvbKu6f1bwC' alt='A young man takes a selfie with members of the Syrian army following the withdrawal of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in Tabqa, Syria, January 18. — Reuters' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Euphrates lines: The deal calls for SDF forces to withdraw to the east of the Euphrates, while Damascus assumes authority in governorates including Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, according to reports citing Syrian state media.</li><li>Local governance: Provisions include reinstating existing civil employees through decrees and creating security arrangements such as a local police force tied to the interior ministry and a security force drawn from local residents.</li><li>Rights pledges: RT reported that President al-Sharaa pledged to respect Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights and address legal issues tied to Kurds’ status and property as part of the settlement.</li><li>Regional politics: RT said the agreement was viewed as aligning with Turkish concerns, describing Ankara’s view of the SDF as linked to the PKK and reporting that the SDF agreed to expel PKK elements from Syria.</li><li>Public mood: Al Jazeera showed Syrians celebrating after the ceasefire announcement halted the latest round of deadly fighting, signaling public relief at a pause in violence.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Syrian government (President Ahmed al-Sharaa): The government presented the ceasefire and integration as a way for the Syrian state to reassert control over most areas and framed it as beneficial for the country as a whole.
