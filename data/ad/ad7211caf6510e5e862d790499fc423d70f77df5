<p>A note sent by Mark Twain&#8217;s American traveling companion to his French landlord, 1867:</p>
<blockquote><p>
PARIS, le 7 Juillet. Monsieur le Landlord &#8212; Sir: Pourquoi don&#8217;t you mettez some savon in your bed-chambers? Est-ce que vous pensez I will steal it? La nuit passee you charged me pour deux chandelles when I only had one; hier vous avez charged me avec glace when I had none at all; tout les jours you are coming some fresh game or other on me, mais vous ne pouvez pas play this savon dodge on me twice. Savon is a necessary de la vie to any body but a Frenchman, et je l&#8217;aurai hors de cet hotel or make trouble. You hear me. Allons.                BLUCHER.
</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I remonstrated against the sending of this note, because it was so mixed up that the landlord would never be able to make head or tail of it; but Blucher said he guessed the old man could read the French of it and average the rest.&#8221;</p>
