<p>Emily Kennard and Margaret Manto, reporting last week for NOTUS (“News of The United States” — a seriously good up-and-coming national affairs publication):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says his “Make America
Healthy Again” Commission report harnesses “gold-standard”
science, citing more than 500 studies and other sources to back up
its claims. Those citations, though, are rife with errors, from
broken links to misstated conclusions.</p>

<p>Seven of the cited sources don’t appear to exist at all.</p>
</blockquote>
