<p>In the latest development in the Greenland dispute, President Trump said the U.S. will impose new import tariffs on eight European NATO countries that oppose his push for the United States to acquire Greenland. The plan sets a 10% tariff starting February 1, with a rise to 25% slated for June 1, and Trump said the measures would stay until a “complete and total purchase” is achieved. European leaders called the threat unacceptable and warned it could harm transatlantic ties, while stressing Denmark’s sovereignty over Greenland and pointing to NATO as the forum to handle Arctic security concerns.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/jmjtPybkjvFRzAzV4mAjyoykishW7ighd-7Spd4ocfy2dWEa0H2-1T9Fp3mtAwiG616u8yJpXKnhRjULJxFYwUqs3p2nnC3zHCDRtjgP' alt='Demonstrators wave Greenlandic flags at a rally in Copenhagen protesting US threats over Greenland.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>EU coordination: EU ambassadors were called into emergency talks on Sunday to coordinate a joint response, with European Council President António Costa saying he was working on an EU-wide approach.</li><li>Diplomacy channel: A high-level White House meeting involving Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Danish officials ended with an agreement to keep searching for a compromise, but did not resolve the dispute.</li><li>Greenland protests: Thousands rallied in Nuuk and in Denmark under “Hands Off Greenland” slogans, with chants including “Greenland is not for sale” and “Make America Go Away,” reflecting public opposition to a sale.</li><li>Trade talks paused: The EU paused negotiations on a proposed EU–US trade pact after Trump linked the new tariffs to Greenland, raising uncertainty around last year’s transatlantic trade truce.</li><li>NATO troop move: European countries sent small military contingents to Greenland at Denmark’s request, described as exercises or support missions intended to show NATO can address Arctic security without changing sovereignty.</li></ul><blockquote>We must open markets, not close them.
