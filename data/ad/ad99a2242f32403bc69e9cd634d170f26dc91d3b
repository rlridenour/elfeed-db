<p>Incumbent Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani&#x27;s Reconstruction and Development coalition claimed victory after Iraq&#x27;s general election, with preliminary counts showing his candidate list topped the vote with more than 1.3 million ballots and a clear lead over other lists; seat allocations will be announced later. The vote took place on 11 November and the Independent High Electoral Commission reported nationwide turnout of roughly 12 million people — about 56% of eligible voters — despite calls from influential cleric Moqtada Sadr to boycott the poll. Supporters gathered in Baghdad&#x27;s Tahrir Square to celebrate the early results, while analysts note Sudani still faces the political task of building a cross-sectarian coalition and balancing Iraq&#x27;s relationships with both Iran and the United States.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/aQiZk-2ycq2-jggujpt8KCLgpAuDFSI7MsGRP5hlgrp_m087yd1d7FzslreZOCD1ALPRxvagcEAGsQBFCSsOdwY8yrYldkmjIwCCIhNDJI4h' alt='Iraqi riot police walk past a screen displaying a portrait of Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani during supporters&#x27; celebrations after preliminary election results were announced in Baghdad on November 12, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Baghdad seat snapshot: In Baghdad the commission&#x27;s preliminary distribution gave Reconstruction and Development 15 of 69 seats, with the Progress (Taqaddum) party and State of Law winning about 10 and 8 seats respectively, underlining a fragmented map across provinces.</li><li>Large candidate field: A total of 7,743 candidates contested the election, including 2,247 women, demonstrating broad participation across Iraq&#x27;s political landscape.</li><li>Reported lead varies: Media reports show different margins in preliminary figures — some counts put Sudani&#x27;s list roughly 370,000 votes ahead while others report a smaller gap (about 217,500), highlighting why final seat allocations are important for government formation.</li><li>Youth turnout note: Observers noted high participation among younger voters in several provinces, a factor parties say shaped results and could pressure new leaders to address jobs and services.</li></ul><blockquote>Our coalition, ‘Reconstruction and Development’, is first - Mohammed Shia al-Sudani</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Mohammed Shia al-Sudani: Sudani congratulated Iraqis on his coalition winning first place and thanked voters for their support, casting the result as a national achievement and claiming a decisive lead in preliminary counts.
