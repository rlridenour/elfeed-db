<li>An immersion blender from one of the best blender brands in the game</li>
<li>Attachments include the blender blade, a 32oz jar for making smoothies, a chopper, and a whisk</li>
<li>Use it to make some soup</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: Actually, it could!</li>
</ul><h1>Break it Down</h1><p>So, let’s just get right to it: Vitamix is a good blender brand. Maybe the best blender brand. And I’m not being hyperbolic. Googling “best blender,” I checked about five articles, and a Vitamix was the first or second-ranked blender in just about every one.</p>
<p>What we have here is not a full-sized blender. It’s an immersion blender with a bunch of nice attachments. You can use it to blend up a smoothie in its 32oz blender jar, process stuff with the chopper, or just attach the blades to puree right in the pot.</p>
<p>Will it do as thorough a job as the full-sized Vitamix offerings they list in those above mentioned articles? Probably not.</p>
<p>But also, it won’t be as cumbersome.</p>
<p>That’s why I love having a solid immersion blender/hand mixer/chopper: for those small yet important kitchen jobs. Like when you want to whip up a few egg whites but don’t want to haul out the huge KitchenAid and find the right attachment. Or when you just need a coarse chop on an onion, a carrot, and some celery, because it’s going to simmer in a sauce that’ll be blended later.</p>
<p>Or when you’re making ‘white chicken chili’ from <a href="https://www.cookingclassy.com/white-chicken-chili/">this recipe</a>, which asks you to puree some (but not all) of the beans to thicken it a little bit. You don’t want to be lugging out a huge food processor and dirtying all the parts just for that!</p>
<p>But, friends, I saved this example to emphasize something important: we currently find ourselves, at this very moment, at the height of soup season. And this Vitamix immersion blender would be an excellent addition to your arsenal of soup-making tools.</p>
<p>Now, if you need to get in a soup-making mood, we recommend playing some good soup music. You know, something made by one of those famed soup-related musical acts, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minestroney Toni Tone</li>
<li>Chicken KoЯn Chowder</li>
<li>David Lee Broth</li>
<li>Panic! At the Bisque-o</li>
<li>Boyz II Ra-Men</li>
<li>Tom (Kha Gai) Waits</li>
<li>Poz-Hole</li>
<li>System of pho Down</li>
<li>GazpachDjo</li>
<li>Beef &amp; Barley Rae Jepson</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, I’m pretty proud of these terrible puns. And you’ll be pretty proud of the various things you make using your Vitamix immersion blender!</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m pretty sure I caught all the times my spellcheck tried to change Vitamix to Vitamin, but if I missed any, let me know in the comments.</p>
