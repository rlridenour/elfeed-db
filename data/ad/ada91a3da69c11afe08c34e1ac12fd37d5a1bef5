<p>As a New York City subway rider, I am constantly exposed to public health posters. More often than not these feature a photo of a wholesome-looking teen whose sober expression is meant to convey hindsight regret at having taken up drugs, dropped out of school, or forgone condoms. They’re well-intended, but boring. I can’t imagine I’d feel differently were I a member of the target demographic. <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MIwuRuGor_o/Trn6lfJhSqI/AAAAAAAAENA/mH0Kk2dvSFw/s1600/zoocotti-ville%2B001.jpg">The Chelsea Mini Storage ads’ saucy regional humor</a> is far more entertaining, as is the train wreck design approach favored by the ubiquitous <a href="http://bleedingedge.pynchonwiki.com/wiki/images/4/42/Dr_Zizmor_Subway_Ad.jpeg">Dr. Jonathan Zizmor.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Public health posters were able to convey their designated horrors far more memorably before photos became the graphical norm. Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí’s</a>&nbsp;sketch (below) and final contribution (top) to the WWII-era anti-venereal disease campaign.</p>

<p>Which image would cause you to steer clear of the red light district, were you a young soldier on the make?</p>
<p>A portrait of a glum fellow soldier (“If I’d only known then…”)?</p>
<p>Or a grinning green death’s head, whose choppers double as the frankly exposed thighs of two faceless, loose-breasted ladies?</p>
<p>Created in 1941, Dalí’s nightmare vision eschewed the sort of manly, militaristic slogan that retroactively ramps up the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180801103943/http://mentalfloss.com/article/30232/18-delightfully-artistic-vintage-std-posters">kitsch value of its ilk</a>. Its message is clear enough without:</p>
<p><em>Stick it in—we’ll bite it off!</em></p>
<p>(Thanks to blogger Rebecca M. Bender for pointing out the composition’s resemblance to the vagina dentata.)</p>
<p>As a feminist, I’m not crazy about depictions of women as pestilential, one-way deathtraps, but I concede that, in this instance, subverting the girlie pin up’s explicitly physical pleasures might well have had the desired effect on horny enlisted men.</p>
<p>A decade later Dalí would collaborate with photographer Philippe Halsman on <a href="https://www.artnet.com/auctions/artists/philippe-halsman/in-voluptas-mors-dal%C3%AD">“In Voluptas Mors,”</a>&nbsp;stacking seven nude models like cheerleaders to form a peacetime skull that’s far less threatening to the male figure in the lower left corner (in this instance, the very dapper Dalí himself).</p>
