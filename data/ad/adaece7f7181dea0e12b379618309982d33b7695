<p>I <a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/115929016469043717">asked for advice about upgrading Django on Mastodon yesterday</a>
and people shared a couple of links I want to remember for the next time I want
to upgrade. (a big part of the reason I started this TIL blog is that I have no system for saving bookmarks other than to publish them to this blog :))</p>
<ul>
<li>Adam Johnson&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/django-upgrade">django-upgrade</a> to automatically upgrade Django project code, as well as his <a href="https://adamj.eu/tech/2025/12/03/django-whats-new-6.0/">what&rsquo;s new in Django posts</a></li>
<li>Django&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/releases/6.0/#backwards-incompatible-changes-in-6-0">official release notes</a>, specifically the section on backwards incompatible changes</li>
<li>Django&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions">list of LTS releases</a></li>
</ul>
