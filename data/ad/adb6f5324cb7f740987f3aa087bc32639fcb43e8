AltStore today <a href="https://rileytestut.com/blog/2025/10/07/evolving-altstore-pal/">announced</a> plans to make its iPhone app available in Australia, Brazil, and Japan later this year, followed by the UK next year.<br/>

AltStore is also gaining "Fediverse" support, via the ActivityPub protocol.<br/>
<br/>
AltStore provides iPhone users with an alternative to Apple's built-in App Store, and it even offers some apps that would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/03/eu-altstore-porn-app/">violate Apple's App Review Guidelines</a>.<br/>
<br/>
AltStore first launched on the iPhone <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/altstore-eu-alternative-app-marketplace/">in the EU last year</a>, after the Digital Markets Act required Apple to allow alternative app stores. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/11/epic-games-apple-australia-ruling/">Australia</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/fortnite-epic-games-brazil/">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/japan-passes-law-to-allow-third-party-app-stores/">Japan</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/28/apple-warns-uk-feature-delays-cma-rules/">UK</a> are working to implement similar regulations, which would pave the way for AltStore to launch in those countries as well. However, the exact timing could shift.<br/>
<br/>
Alternative app stores have been supported on the iPhone and iPad in the EU since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/apple-releases-ios-17-4/">iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 were released</a> in April 2024. AltStore and other alternative app stores can be installed on these devices via Safari or another web browser.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to announce or implement support for alternative app stores in Australia, Brazil, Japan, and the UK, as regulations in those countries are still being finalized and/or have yet to be enforced. AltStore has simply announced its plans early.<br/>

In the U.S., the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-sued-by-us-department-of-justice/">filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple</a> last year, but the case is ongoing and alternative app stores on the iPhone remain unsupported there.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/altstore/">AltStore</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/07/altstore-on-iphone-more-countries-plan/">AltStore Plans to Launch iPhone App in Three More Countries This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/altstore-plans-to-launch-iphone-app-in-three-more-countries-this-year.2468643/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
