</ul><h1>The Key To Efficiency</h1><p>Life, amirite?</p>
<p>It’s always go-go-go. Every day, you wake up, you get ready, you get out the door for work or settle into your home office. Then it’s one thing after another until you clock out, at which point, you’ve got dinner to think about, then some unwind time, then sleep, then it starts all over again.</p>
<p>But it’s important to slow down once in a while, to really assess things, to answer some of life’s pressing questions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you really want, personally and professionally?</li>
</ul>
<p>And…</p>
<ul>
<li>When have you been your happiest, and why?</li>
</ul>
<p>And also…</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the fuck did all these keys come from?</li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously, you could be self-employed, no office to go into, living in a bungalow with a single door that leads in or out, and somehow, next to that door, there will be a bowl. And in that bowl, there’ll be, like, 40 keys.</p>
<p>One to your house. One to your parents’ house. A few for friends’ houses, in the event of cat-sitting needs. Your bike lock key. The key to the padlock on the shed. The key to another padlock. The key that the strange old man on the train pressed into your hand one day and said, “You have been chosen to unlock the door holding all of humanity back.”</p>
<p>You know, just a whole bunch of totally normal keys.</p>
<p>And again, this is the best-case scenario. If you’re not WFH, you’ll have work keys to deal with. And you probably use each of them once every three months, but you need to have them, just in case.</p>
<p>What we’re saying is that every one of us is constantly walking around like the nightwatchman from an old-timey movie with a big old wad of jinglers.</p>
<p>But we don’t have to be. Because they make key organizers. Like the ones we’re selling today.</p>
<p>These things won’t take up much more pocket space than a stick of lip balm, and yet each one can hold up to 8 keys. Plus, they come in gift boxes. So you can keep one for yourself and gift one if you want.</p>
<p>Point is, they’ll keep your keys organized. Which is nice.</p>
<p>So buy them and keep your keys organized.</p>
