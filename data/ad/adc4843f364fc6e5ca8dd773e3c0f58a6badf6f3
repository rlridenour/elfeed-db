 
          <p>I bought some more expensive looking Nintendo switch game cartridges. I blame <a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/">Joel</a>&rsquo;s convincing who manages to bypass my already weak resistance to these kinds of messages. This, combined with a diminishing amount of time available to put into gaming, results into my physical backlog being larger than ever before. It&rsquo;s been three years since I wrote part III and I have more thoughts so here we go.</p>
<p>Perhaps read <a href="/post/2021/02/the-insanity-of-retro-game-collecting/">Part I</a>, <a href="/post/2021/05/re-is-collecting-physical-games-worth-it">Part II</a>, and <a href="/post/2022/10/is-collecting-physical-games-worth-it-part-iii/">Part III</a> first.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about pricing. In part III, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder whether or not I should give up this ridiculousness. Instead, I could buy three games instead of one, and send the money where it belongs: the developers. [&hellip;]</p></blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that the price point of a physical game is much higher than that of a digital one. In general, digital versions cost about <code>50%</code> less&mdash;without taking the frequent sales into account that for some reason never happens for physical counterparts. In part III, I discovered that including taxes, physical games cost about <code>2.7</code> times more! Outrageous!</p>
<p>Or is it? It&rsquo;s not! Wait, what? I decided to keep part IV a positive one and have changed my mind since complaining about the price. The higher price comes with a few advantages, hear me out.</p>
<p>First, if something is more expensive, it takes more of a deliberate action to buy it. You don&rsquo;t blindly press the <em>add to cart</em> and <em>check out</em> buttons: you first contemplate whether it&rsquo;s worth it. Is this game really something I&rsquo;m willing to pour time into? Should I really get this version considering my backlog already has three too long jRPGs on it? Instead of buying three games on sale in the eShop, you can only buy one so you better make that choice count.</p>
<p>Also, precisely because of that deliberate action, I find that actually playing and finishing these games is easier. If you&rsquo;ve paid that much for a game, you better pour that time into it, otherwise it&rsquo;s money wasted. Chances are much lower of buying a total bust as you&rsquo;ll be more thoroughly researching instead of recklessly buying. In the end, I end up enjoying these games more because I feel the need to spend more time with them. And that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Third, that price has never really gone up. A typical Limited Run Game costs <code>€35</code>&mdash;including shipping and taxes, that&rsquo;s almost <code>€60</code>. Sixty is the about same amount I paid for a brand new copy of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> in 2004 and it is about the same amount I paid for a brand new copy of the 2024 <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> remake on the Switch last year. When taking <a href="https://www.inflationtool.com/euro-belgium?amount=60&amp;year1=2004&amp;year2=2024&amp;frequency=yearly">inflation into account</a>, that should have been <code>€96,97</code> instead, an increase of <code>61%</code>.</p>
<p>Observe the following graph depicting a very imprecise history of video game pricing from 1985 (NES) to now. The blue top line is the actual value adjusted for inflation, the red bottom line is the sticker price.</p>

<p>Yes, in the early nineties, cartridge gaming was expensive, although there were many exceptions. Most Mega Drive carts we bought were new and on sale, never reaching <code>€50</code> or their Belgian Francs equivalent. We transitioned to <a href="/post/2025/10/i-owe-warez-for-properly-discovering-crpgs/">pirating PC games</a> when those N64 carts became even more expensive. But the biggest takeaway from that graph is the flatline from 2000-ish to just before 2023: relatively speaking, the full price of a physical video game has been stable for more than twenty years.</p>
<p>That means <code>€60</code> for a console game<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and <code>€40</code> for the GB(A)/(3)DS counterpart acts as my golden reference point. Convenient then, that limited physical edition releases of Switch games also aim for that range if you include shipping and taxes. This is the reason why I will be totally fine by paying the &ldquo;full price&rdquo; for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> when the digital counterpart is only <code>€10</code>. Ridiculously cheap, by the way, as this is a slap in the face for other indie studios that struggle to get attention, but that&rsquo;s an entirely different matter.</p>
<p>Sixty &ldquo;bucks&rdquo;&mdash;can I say <em>bucks</em> when I&rsquo;m in the Euro zone?&mdash;is perfectly reasonable to put down in exchange for deliberate action. Deliberate action that finally got me to sit down and finish the <a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/games/switch/rise-of-the-triad-ludicrous-edition/">Rise of the Triad: The Dark War</a> campaign while back in 1994 I didn&rsquo;t even make it to the fourth level of the shareware episode, even though I admired the game.</p>
<p>If you still find that hard to stomach, consider this: that Steam copy of your game can be retracted at any time. You&rsquo;re basically just loaning it even though you&rsquo;ve paid for it. This has happened before and will happen again. Meanwhile, I can sit back, relax, and laugh, clinging onto all my physical stuff that slowly but surely takes over the house, like a <em>Creature of the Night</em>.</p>
<p>Even though that might be a slight exaggeration, there&rsquo;s another graph that we can easily imagine if we think about value over time as an investment. I know it sounds ridiculous to think of buying games as an investment, and it is, even though many collectors treat it as such. There will be a point when Nintendo Switch games will no longer be produced, and it doesn&rsquo;t take more than a few months for a price to go up according to websites like <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/">pricecharting.com</a>. That is, this graph is the opposite of the above one: your Limited Run Game copy will become more sought after, but the devaluation of money will keep that investment more or less constant&mdash;depending on the game, amount of copies, et cetera.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, your digital copy will be worth <em>nada</em> simply because you can&rsquo;t get rid of it as you never really owned it in the first place.</p>
<p>To conclude, I wrote another thousand words to confirm what I already said in <a href="/post/2021/05/re-is-collecting-physical-games-worth-it/">part II</a> four years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Physical games are usually more expensive. And that’s an advantage. Why? Because the more money I spent on a game, the more conscious the decision will be.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh well. At least the graph is a nice touch, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
