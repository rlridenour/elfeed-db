<p>William Stokes&#8217; <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8Chy0AEACAAJ"><em>Pictorial Multiplication Table</em></a> of 1866 promised to teach multiplication facts to a child of average ability in less than half an hour. It did this by representing each digit with an object:</p>

<p>A TREE means 1, from one trunk springs.<br />
A BIRD means 2, it has two wings.<br />
A BOAT is 3, three sails are shown.<br />
ANIMALS 4, four legs they own.<br />
A MAN means 5, five fingers he.<br />
A HOUSE means 6, six windows see.<br />
A CHURCH means 7, not windows less.<br />
A LADY 8, see eight-flounced dress.<br />
A BRIDGE is 9, nine lamps are found.<br />
A BOY means 0, see hoop so round.</p>
<p>Now each fact can be represented by a picture. Here&#8217;s the &#8220;twice&#8221; table:</p>

<p>These are the products of 2 with the first 12 integers, in order. The second box, representing 2 &#215; 2, depicts a dog, which is an ANIMAL with 4 legs, so 2 &#215; 2 is 4. The sixth box, representing 2 &#215; 6, depicts a TREE and a BIRD, so 2 &#215; 6 = 12. And so on. The first box, which covers the fact that 2 &#215; 1 = 2, is omitted because we&#8217;ve already mastered the fact that 1 &#215; 2 = 2 (in the &#8220;once&#8221; table). The 10th and 11th boxes are blank because multiplication by 10 and 11 are considered so easy that no mnemonic is needed.</p>
<p>How can we remember the &#8220;twice&#8221; table itself? Stokes provides a verbal rhyme that sums it up:</p>
<p><em>Twice</em> &#8212; Dog, Cot, Reader, Nest, and Bird flying;<br />
Giraffe, Inn, Shower, and Camel dying.</p>
<p>In this way a student can master every fact up to 12 &#215; 12 by memorizing 59 simple pictures (and 12 rhymes). How well this worked, and whether the images could be carried accurately in one&#8217;s head through a lifetime, is less clear.</p>
