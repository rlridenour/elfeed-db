Eli Zaretskii <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2025-08/msg00493.html">writes</a> that Emacs 30.2 has been released and is ready for download. It&rsquo;s a bug fix release but still worth installing. As usual, I built mine from source. I had a bit of difficulty downloading the tar and signature files because the mirrors hadn&rsquo;t yet updated. By the time you read this, the mirrors should be up to date.

I&rsquo;m writing this in Emacs-30.2 and haven&rsquo;t experienced any problems. Once I got everything downloaded, the compile and install experienced no problems.

As usual, I want to express my thanks to Eli and all the other devs who selflessly contribute their time and efforts to keep Emacs the best in class editor. These guys are heroes and if you ever find yourself in the same bar as one of them, drinks should be on you.</p>
