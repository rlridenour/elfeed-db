<p>The US government has temporarily paused all immigration applications, including green cards and citizenship naturalizations, for people from 19 non‑European countries that have already faced travel restrictions since June, citing national security and public safety concerns after an attack on National Guard members in Washington last week. The memorandum applies to applicants from countries such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Sudan, Eritrea, Burma (Myanmar), Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and several others that were previously subject to either full or partial entry suspensions, now extending limits from visa issuance at consulates to the processing of long‑term status in the US itself. Officials frame the move as a tightening of security vetting for legal immigration, while civil liberties advocates and migration experts warn it could leave thousands of lawful applicants in limbo and further separate families who had already cleared earlier stages of US checks. The step also underscores President Trump’s broader strategy of reshaping not only irregular but also legal immigration pathways, while attributing perceived security risks to policy shifts under former president Joe Biden.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/i-OLohb8hr0R0EE5Dv0L3z1X0g316jagIn_0IrWgIG0_xo5-bJy6qDRLm2wMK00y3eAumPdN3EMWAjuomPEJw4y93kpzj-hUppbzU0eAKM_ad74ZaEXC-plDASdnAor8TuXFKmJnEUP8wqADTo3ObYX7pI2rFeLwXrKFTjGCofzpahMHFEswgem4mdFU7xZ4_vOMA3QF6BLayNThe5IjQ9ydGXAHAszd_vcg9OU58eQTo9zLyQis-3xOVbL3yhzWNfkBCN5bJa9Klzz2QQ' alt='President Trump attends a cabinet meeting at the White House as his administration announces a pause in immigration processing for 19 countries.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Countries affected: The paused processing covers applicants from 19 states, including Afghanistan, Yemen, Haiti, Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Libya, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Venezuela, all of which were already on a US travel‑restriction list announced in June.</li><li>Scope of freeze: The memorandum halts adjudication of a wide range of benefits—such as lawful permanent residence, naturalization, and other immigration requests—rather than focusing only on temporary visitor visas, representing a significant expansion of earlier entry bans.</li><li>Triggering incident: The policy cites as context a shooting attack on US National Guard members in Washington in which an Afghan man was arrested as a suspect, an incident that left one guard member dead and another critically injured.</li><li>Ceremonies canceled: Citizenship oath ceremonies for eligible migrants from the 19 countries have been canceled under the pause, even for people who had already completed most of the naturalization process.</li><li>Critics&#x27; concerns: Rights groups and legal experts quoted in coverage say the step could create prolonged uncertainty for refugees, family‑reunification applicants and long‑term residents who have been living and working legally in the US while awaiting final decisions.</li></ul><blockquote>The pause applies to people from 19 countries that were already subjected to a partial travel ban in June, placing further restrictions on immigration – a core feature of Donald Trump’s political platform. - The Guardian staff (news report wording)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: Officials describe the move as a security‑driven pause designed to tighten national security screenings for immigrants from countries already identified as higher‑risk earlier this year.
