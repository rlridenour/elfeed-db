<p>The New York Times’s DealBook newsletter published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/business/dealbook/cook-apple-trump.html?unlocked_article_code=1.KU8.isxi.V2s-5nvEGGpU&amp;smid=url-share">a smart piece about how Tim Cook might placate Donald Trump</a> regarding his insistence that the iPhone be made in America when it can’t actually be, anytime soon if ever:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Cook could announce plans to begin assembling some iPhones in the U.S. within three years, and lay out a detailed road map to make more of them… That would give Trump a tangible win: Apple devices would effectively say, “Assembled in the USA.”…</p>
<p>  The analogy in manufacturing, often made by industry experts, is that “American-made” often means “American-assembled,” using global components. This is a crucial distinction and, depending on Trump’s mood, a palatable one.
</p></blockquote>
<p>“Depending on Trump’s mood” is doing a lot of work there, but yes, if you can’t make iPhones in the U.S., can you perhaps come up with a program to create U.S. factory jobs for last-stage assembly that would allow the White House to declare victory?</p>
<p>On top of that, perhaps the smart move is for Apple to also announce an investment in getting U.S. workers up to speed so that more manufacturing can be brought home:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Apple could also announce a public-private partnership to invest in skilled workers in the U.S…. “Manufacturing costs and skilled labor to produce the iPhone are the real obstacles. It’s not just a Trump threat and a snap of the fingers that’s going to make this happen,” [Wedbush Securities analyst Dan] Ives said. “The U.S. government needs to play a role to make this herculean strategic move a reality.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>If we accept that Apple can’t make iPhones in the U.S. anytime soon (and every expert agrees that it’s impossible), this sounds like a reasonable way forward. But if the President of the United States refuses to accept that reality, it’s unclear if there’s any move Tim Cook can make that will satisfy him.</p>
