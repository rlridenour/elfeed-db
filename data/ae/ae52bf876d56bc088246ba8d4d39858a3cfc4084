<p>Until the end of his life, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> (1934–1996) continued doing what he did all along — popularizing science and “enthusiastically conveying the wonders of the universe to millions of people on television and in books.” Whenever Sagan appeared on <em>The Tonight Show</em> with Johnny Carson during the 70s and 80s, his goal was to connect with everyday Americans — people who didn’t subscribe to <em><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/">Scientific American</a>&nbsp;— </em>and&nbsp;increase the public’s understanding and appreciation of science.</p>
<p>At the end of his life, Sagan still cared deeply about where science stood in the public imagination. But while losing a battle with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/myelodysplastic/Patient/page1">myelodysplasia</a>, Sagan also sensed that scientific thinking was losing ground in America, and even more ominously within the chambers of the Newt Gingrich-led Congress.</p>

<p>During his final&nbsp;interview, aired on May 27, 1996,&nbsp;Sagan issued a strong&nbsp;warning, telling Charlie Rose:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve arranged a society on science and technology in which nobody understands anything about science and technology, and this combustible mixture of ignorance and power sooner or later is going to blow up in our faces. I mean, who is running the science and technology in a democracy if the people don’t know anything about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>And he also went on to add:</p>
<blockquote><p>And the second reason that I’m worried about this is that science is more than a body of knowledge. It’s a way of thinking. A way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then we’re up for grabs for the next charlatan political or religious who comes ambling along.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nearly 30 years later, we have reached that point. Under the second Trump administration, DOGE has rushed to dismantle the scientific infrastructure of our government, haphazardly cutting the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and NASA. Next, they’re going after our leading research universities, intentionally weakening the research engine that has fueled the growth of American corporations—and the overall American economy—since World War II. And they’re replacing scientific leaders with charlatans like RFK Jr. who dabble in the very pseudoscience that Sagan warned us about. Needless to say, our competitors aren’t making the same mistakes. Few serious governments are stupid enough to cut off their nose to spite their face.</p>
