  <p>That same process is happening now with stupid people. They’re

<p>How individual stupid Americans are becoming the collective,
self-aware group of Stupid-Americans is a great idea for a lot of
very fancy journalism I’m sure. It’s probably got something to do
with the internet, where stupid people can find and repeat stupid
things to each other over and over and over again.</p>

<p>I believe it has a <em>lot</em> to do with the Internet, which has functioned as a terribly efficient sorting machine. It used to be that there were conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans. Both political parties were, effectively, shades of purple. Now we’ve sorted ourselves, and the result is the palpable increase in polarization. Low-IQ stupidity might still be spread across both sides of the political aisle, but willful ignorance — the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/11/30/asimov-cult-of-ignorance">dogmatic cultish belief</a> that loudmouths’ opinions are on equal ground with facts and evidence presented by informed experts — is the entire basis of the MAGA movement. A regular stupid person might say, “Well, I don’t know anything about vaccines, so I better listen to my doctor, who is highly educated and well-informed on the subject.” An out-and-proud Stupid-American says “I don’t know anything about vaccines either, so I’m going to listen to a kook who admits that a worm ate part of his brain, because I can’t understand the science but I <em>can</em> understand conspiracy theories.”</p>

  <p>If written language survives the next six weeks, we’ll be writing
about Donald Trump for a thousand years. But whatever else there
is to say, the most important thing about Donald Trump, the thing
that is obvious from watching him speak for just 14 seconds, is
that he is profoundly stupid. Whatever it is that he might be
talking about or doing at any given moment, it’s clear that while
he has a reptilian instinct for reading and stoking conflict, he
has no real idea what’s going on and he doesn’t really care to.
Stupid is what he is <em>and</em> where he comes from. It is his mind and
his soul. Catholic was what JFK was. Gay was what Harvey Milk was.
Stupid is <em>who</em> Donald Trump is.</p>

<p>And that’s what they love most, the Stupid-American voters.</p>

<p>Remember that sentence you heard at the beginning of all this in
2016? “He’s just saying what everybody is thinking.”</p>

<p>But see, not everybody was thinking that Hillary Clinton was an
alien, that global warming was a Chinese hoax and that what
America needed most of all was a plywood wall stretching from
Texas to California. Only the stupid people were. And suddenly, in
an instant, the most powerful man on earth was thinking just like
them. With his clueless smirk and unstoppable rise, he turned
people whose stupidity made them feel like nobody into people who
felt like everybody.</p>

<p>That’s why he’ll never lose them. Because it was never about what
he did or didn’t do. All that stuff is very confusing and the
Stupid-American community isn’t interested in the details. They
love him for who he is, which is one of them, and because he shows
them every day that Stupid-Americans can reach the social
mountaintop.</p>
