The second beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> hints at the existence of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a new display size, perhaps the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> that's expected this fall.<br/>

<em><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2825036/ios-26-beta-2-seemingly-confirms-the-existence-of-the-ultra-thin-iphone-17-air.html">Macworld</a></em> found a version of the classic iOS clownfish wallpaper with a "420x912@3x" resolution, which translates to a 1260 x 2736 resolution. That does not match the resolution of any &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that's available now, but it is similar in size to what we're expecting for the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple analyst <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/關於2h25新款iphone-17產品組合與超薄iphone-17的預測與分析-predictions-and-analysis-of-the-2h25-new-iphone-17-1528d0772610">Ming-Chi Kuo suggested</a> Apple's new ultra slim <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> model would feature a 6.6-inch display with a resolution of approximately 1260 x 2740, which is close to what was found in the beta.<br/>
<br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models set to come out in September with &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; pre-installed, it seems likely that the wallpaper is designed for the all-new device that Apple plans or release this year.<br/>
<br/>
With a 6.6-inch display size, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will be smaller than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> Max and larger than the standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. It will have a super thin chassis, which rumors suggest could measure in at around 5.5mm. Other rumored features include Apple's C1 modem and a single-lens rear camera.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/ios-26-beta-2-iphone-17-air/">Signs of iPhone 17 Air Spotted in iOS 26 Beta 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/signs-of-iphone-17-air-spotted-in-ios-26-beta-2.2459545/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
