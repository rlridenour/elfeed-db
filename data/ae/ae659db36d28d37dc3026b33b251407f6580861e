<p>A fire tore through a seven‑storey office building in central Jakarta around midday on Tuesday, killing at least 22 people as many employees were on their lunch break, Indonesian police and emergency officials said. The blaze is believed to have started on the first floor before spreading upward, sending thick black smoke into the air and forcing workers to flee, with some climbing down ladders to escape. Firefighters deployed roughly 100 personnel and multiple fire engines to contain the flames and rescue people trapped inside the building. Authorities have opened an investigation into the cause of the fire and are working to identify the victims while supporting injured survivors and their families.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/v7tPTe2_1pVJeAaWu74X84-Ng_9ofKj7CTLkU1Rc-za4XiOiR07wf40FMdOljtiiToehOIaVHHD3KI2dLoKFTLQhxSDFHb2DAYGmyAo-u0D2rN7t7B1MyFCN9Pse1AjgLoF7etdazUErJB-A8AWfyCrWlw-azRt2fx7abZdL1g' alt='Rescue workers and fire engines at the site of the office building fire in central Jakarta.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Rescue efforts: Emergency responders evacuated at least 19 people alive from the building, including some who were unconscious, while battling intense heat and heavy smoke.</li><li>Casualty details: Among the confirmed dead were office employees, security staff, cleaning workers, and at least one pregnant woman, according to police statements cited by local media.</li><li>Time and location: The fire broke out shortly after midday in the Kemayoran area of Central Jakarta, a dense commercial and residential neighborhood with many low‑ and mid‑rise office blocks.</li><li>Visible damage: Flames and thick black smoke were seen pouring from several floors, scorching the building’s facade and shattering windows as nearby streets were cordoned off.</li><li>Official response: Jakarta’s police and fire departments said they would review building safety compliance and fire protection systems at the site as part of the ongoing investigation.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Jakarta fire department: Fire officials described deploying dozens of trucks and crews to the scene and said the fire was brought under control after an intensive operation lasting several hours.
