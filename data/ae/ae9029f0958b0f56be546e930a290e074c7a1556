<p id="p2">Not long ago, Isaac Marovitz, the developer behind Whisky, the open source WINE front-end that made it easy to play Windows games on a Mac, <a href="https://docs.getwhisky.app/maintenance-notice" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the project had come to an end. Whisky is how <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/i-tried-to-run-cities-skylines-2-on-my-m2-macbook-air-via-apples-game-porting-toolkit-and-i-discovered-a-great-app-instead/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nil&eacute;ane got Cities: Skylines 2 running</a> on an M2 MacBook Air in 2023, and the project was well-regarded in the gaming community for its ease of use. In shutting down the project, Marovitz encouraged Whisky users to move to <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/store/" rel="noopener noreferrer">CrossOver</a>, a paid app by CodeWeavers.</p>
<p id="p3">In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/teen-coder-shuts-down-open-source-mac-app-whisky-citing-harm-to-paid-apps/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Ars Technica&rsquo;s Kevin Purdy</a>, Marovitz said:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  &ldquo;I am 18, yes, and attending Northeastern University, so it&rsquo;s always a balancing act between my school work and dev work,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://isaacmarovitz.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaac Marovitz</a>&nbsp;wrote to Ars. The Whisky project has &ldquo;been more or less in this state for a few months, I posted the notice mostly to clarify and formally announce it,&rdquo; Marovitz said, having received &ldquo;a lot of questions&rdquo; about the project status.

<p id="p5"><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/teen-coder-shuts-down-open-source-mac-app-whisky-citing-harm-to-paid-apps/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As Purdy explained for Ars Technica</a>, Marovitz also became concerned that his free project threatened CrossOver, and by extension, WINE itself. Last week, <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/jramey/2025/4/18/whisky-s-legacy-and-the-spirit-it-leaves-behind" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeWeavers&rsquo; CEO wrote about the shutdown</a>, to acknowledge Marovitz&rsquo;s work and commend his desire to protect the WINE project.</p>
<p id="p6">It&rsquo;s always a shame to see a project as popular and polished as Whisky discontinued. Some gamers may not like that CrossOver is a paid product, but I&rsquo;m glad that there&rsquo;s an alternative for those who want it.</p>
<p id="p7">To me though, the popularity and fragility of projects like Whisky highlight that a better solution would be for Apple to open its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/games/game-porting-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Porting Toolkit</a> to users. The Game Porting Toolkit is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/" rel="noopener noreferrer">built on CrossOver&rsquo;s open source code</a>. However, unlike the CrossOver app sold to gamers, Apple&rsquo;s Game Porting Toolkit is meant for developers who want to move a game from Windows to Mac. It&rsquo;s not impossible for gamers to use, but it&rsquo;s not easy either. I&rsquo;m <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/02/to-embrace-gaming-apple-needs-to-level-up-its-game-porting-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer">not the first</a> to suggest this, and <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/how-apple-maybe-moves-the-needle-on-mac-gaming/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve has demonstrated</a> both the technical and commercial viability of such an approach with Proton, but as WWDC approaches, a user-facing Game Porting Toolkit is near the top of my macOS 16 wish list.</p>
