iOS 27 will no longer include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/apple-health-plus-rumored-to-launch-next-year/">long-rumored feature</a> known as Apple Health+ inside Apple, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/apple-is-scaling-back-plans-for-new-ai-based-health-coach-service"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

Apple Health+ was supposed to be a virtual health coach that could give users AI-powered health recommendations in the Apple Health app, based on their personal health data, the report said. The feature would have provided users with detailed health reports, videos that explained medical conditions and offered wellness tips, and more.<br/>
<br/>
"The major new service would have combined new surveys and health assessments with data from Apple Watches and external lab reports," the report added.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if Apple Health+ would have been a paid subscription service.<br/>
<br/>
The feature is being scaled back instead of outright canceled. The report said some of the components of Apple Health+, such as suggestions based on existing Health app data, will be "repurposed and introduced as early as this year."<br/>
<br/>
Apple Health+ was initially rumored to be an iOS 26 feature, so it was seemingly in development for a long time. But now, only bits and pieces of it will launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's services chief Eddy Cue is apparently "considering changes" to Apple Fitness+ as well, but the report did not provide any specific details.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-health/">Apple Health</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-27/">iOS 27</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/apple-reportedly-scales-back-ios-27-feature/">Apple Reportedly Scaling Back This Long-Rumored iOS 27 Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-scaling-back-this-long-rumored-ios-27-feature.2477256/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
