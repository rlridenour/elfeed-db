<p>Tom Ellison, at McSweeney’s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How are my competitors doing, the ones you all insisted students use instead of me? That’s right, they were supposed to go to the <em>American Journal of Social Sciences, Powered by OpenAI</em>. Or museums, like the Smithsonian’s Charlie Kirk Shrine to American Greatness. I guess they can still count on credible journalism, once they get past the paywall for <em>Palantir Presents: The Washington Post</em>, so they read the Pulitzer-Bezos Prize–winning work of coeditors-in-chief Bari Weiss and Grok.</p>
