  <dt><a href="https://iloveapiano.app/">I Love a Piano</a></dt>
  <dd>I met Max Mellman at Macstock and we became fast friends. His first app is a piano synth with multiple on-screen scrollable keyboards, different piano sounds, and a built in music player with fine scrubbing for learning along with your favorite music.</dd>

  <dd>A book from my friend Michael D.J. Eisenberg ((The Tech-Savvy Lawyer): The Lawyer&rsquo;s Guide to Podcasting: Building Your Brand, Audience, Tech Stack, and Expertise!</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/rhsev/mi.lan">rhsev/mi.lan:</a></dt>
  <dd>A lightweight URL bridge for macOS automation, and a companion for <a href="https://github.com/rhsev/dy.lan">dy.lan</a>, which I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2026/01/27/a-url-router-that-turns-your-local-network-into-a-workflow-engine/">wrote about last week</a>.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vimari/id1480933944?mt=12">‎Vimari App - App Store</a></dt>
  <dd>A port of Vimium for Safari. Vimium is one of my favorite extensions on Chrome and Firefox, and I&rsquo;d always missed it on Safari, not realizing someone had already ported it.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/linkthing/id1666031776">‎LinkThing</a></dt>
  <dd>Not perfect, but if you need to view and search your linkding bookmarks, this runs on all Apple platforms and does the trick.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot">moltbot/moltbot: Your own personal AI assistant.</a></dt>
  <dd>A personal chatbot assistant for any OS and any platform. I think this is what I&rsquo;m going to do with one of the 2012 Mac minis I picked up for $25.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown">Gas Town - multi-agent workspace manager</a></dt>
  <dd>We talked about this at some length on the <a href="https://overtiredpod.com/ep/442/">last Overtired</a>. Run multiple AI coding agents simultaneously with lots of useful features. Not cheap to implement fully, but powerful.</dd>

    <p>From a Palestinian-Australian developer and supported by Tech for Palestine, a solid looking alternative to Instagram that allows text updates and no shadow banning/censorship. Right now it&rsquo;s mostly my source for news from Gaza, but I&rsquo;m curious to see how it grows. They&rsquo;ve already hit limitations of scale and are updating rapidly.</p>
