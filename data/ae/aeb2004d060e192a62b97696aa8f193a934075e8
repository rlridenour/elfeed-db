<p>It’s time once again for the annual Relay St. Jude Fundraiser.</p>



<p>St. Jude isn&#8217;t just a hospital—it&#8217;s a beacon of hope for families facing the unimaginable. They&#8217;re leading the global effort to understand, treat, and defeat childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Their groundbreaking research doesn&#8217;t just help the children within their walls; it benefits kids worldwide who will never set foot on their campus.</p>



<p>And don’t forget,&nbsp;<strong>No family ever receives a bill.</strong>&nbsp;Not for treatment, travel, housing, or food. When your child is fighting for their life, the last thing you should worry about is whether you can afford to save them. St. Jude ensures that no child is denied treatment based on race, religion, or a family&#8217;s ability to pay.</p>



<p>This philosophy isn&#8217;t just noble—it&#8217;s expensive. That&#8217;s where we come in.</p>



<p>Since 2019, our corner of the internet—the Relay FM community—has raised over $4 million for St. Jude. That&#8217;s not a typo. Four million dollars from podcast listeners and tech enthusiasts who understand that some things matter more than the latest Apple announcement or productivity hack.</p>
