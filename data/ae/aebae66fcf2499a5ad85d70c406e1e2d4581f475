<p>Something I learned today from a coworker: if you turn your monitor sideways, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering">subpixel anti-aliasing</a> gets completely broken. This isn&rsquo;t as much of an issue on today&rsquo;s high-dpi displays, but for anything lower than a 4k screen, the effect can be noticeable.</p>
<p>Just a little interesting thing I learned today. Thanks to my good, knowledgeable friend and coworker Jonner Steck!</p>
<p>Also, while we&rsquo;re on the topic of font rendering, I&rsquo;ve updated <a href="https://codeberg.org/ashton314/iosevka-output">Iosevka Output</a> to more closely match Input Mono: the cross-bar on the <code>f</code> now lines up nicely with the x-height. However, I kept the hook on the <code>f</code> open; I think it&rsquo;s more legible than Input in that regard. I&rsquo;ve finally switched over from preferring Input and seeing Iosevka as weird, to now seeing my custom font as the familiar, good-looking one and the Input, though still very good-looking, is a little less familiar.</p>
