<p>Last time I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/11/28/a-health-update/">wrote about my health</a>, I had an inkling of what was going on with me, and now I have some diagnoses to work with. Thanks to my readers for their support as I grapple with my health changes.</p>

<p>I knew I had some form of <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6004-dysautonomia" title="What It Is, Symptoms, Types &amp; Treatment">dysautonomia</a>, but I was having trouble finding a doctor who was curious enough about my various symptoms<sup id="fnref:symptoms"><a href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:symptoms" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to give me a diagnosis. I finally found what I needed through the <a href="https://www.eds.clinic/" title="The EDS Clinic:Medical Care for Ehlers Danlos Syndrome"><abbr title="Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome">EDS</abbr> Clinic</a>, with a hat tip to <a href="https://terra.incognita.net/@blackqueeriroh">Bryan Guffey</a> for pointing me there.</p>

<p>It was a Telehealth appointment, which allowed for visual tests like mobility and basic orthostatic tests, but lacked blood work, so some of these are initial diagnoses that could change. Just that morning I&rsquo;d had an orthostatic pulse and blood pressure reading at Gundersen Health, so I was armed with the numbers and observations from that. I came out of it with diagnoses of:</p>

<ul class="abbr_desc">
  <li><a href="https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-hsd/" title="The Ehlers Danlos Society"><abbr title="Hypermobile Spectrum Disorder">HSD</abbr></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16560-postural-orthostatic-tachycardia-syndrome-pots" title="Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis &amp; Treatment"><abbr title="Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome">POTS</abbr></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/mast-cell-activation-syndrome" title="Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)"><abbr title="Mast Cell Activation Syndrome">MCAS</abbr></a></li>
  <li>And likely <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-outlet-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353988" title="Thoracic outlet syndrome-Symptoms and causes"><abbr title="Thoracic Outlet Syndrome">TOS</abbr></a></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these are surprises &mdash; I had done extensive research on autonomic disorders and knew where my symptoms fit (and where they didn&rsquo;t). Thanks to a growing database in <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink" title="DEVONthink, professional document and ...">DEVONthink</a> and some research help from my partner, I had a cross-referenced list of symptoms and possible correlations ready to go. I&rsquo;ve found that with rare diseases &mdash; especially ones that don&rsquo;t show up in blood work or show up with results that are individually explicable in other ways &mdash; it&rsquo;s best to show up armed with as much information as possible. Thankfully, because the clinic specialized in <abbr title="Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome">EDS</abbr>, the physician was ready to listen and fully versed in the various disorders and syndromes comprising dysautonomia.</p>

<p>So now that I have some diagnoses, I&rsquo;ve started treatment, and things have improved markedly. Some interventions &mdash; like increasing water and salt intake and applying abdominal compression &mdash; are easy and have already improved my <abbr title="Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome">POTS</abbr> symptoms, which include dizziness and syncope (passing out) when standing up. I&rsquo;m more functional than I have been in six months. And I&rsquo;ve started medications, both over the counter and prescription, which have started to help symptoms like constant dizziness (even when seated or prone) and skin burning. I&rsquo;m still dizzy as I write this, and some of these interventions might take a while, but things are getting better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll follow up with some blood work, and I need to find <abbr title="Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome">EDS</abbr>-aware physical therapists, but I have referrals and orders for all of that. It&rsquo;s such a relief to be making forward progress. I&rsquo;ve communicated with people with similar diagnoses who&rsquo;ve told me that it took two or more years (in one case six) to get a diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve joked that my current title is:</p>

<p>Brett Terpstra <em><abbr title="Minneapolis College of Art and Design">BFA</abbr>, <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr>, <abbr title="Substance Use Disorder">SUD</abbr>, <abbr title="Bipolar Disorder">BD</abbr>, <abbr title="Religious Trauma Syndrome">RTS</abbr>, <abbr title="Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder">CPTSD</abbr>, <abbr title="Hypermobile Spectrum Disorder">HSD</abbr>, <abbr title="Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome">POTS</abbr>, <abbr title="Mast Cell Activation Syndrome">MCAS</abbr>, <abbr title="Thoracic Outlet Syndrome">TOS</abbr></em></p>

<p>Which is quite a Scrabble board, but it looks more impressive than just having an &ldquo;MD&rdquo; after your name, right? I only went to college for four years, but I&rsquo;ve gathered a lot of letters since then (and none of them great).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so thankful for my community &mdash; from readers here to Facebook to Mastodon to real life friends and family &mdash; and the leg up I got by sharing openly and receiving information from them. I know that I might be risking some privacy by sharing too much, but the benefits have been great thus far. I never would have gotten to this point without help. I have further to go, but I feel like I&rsquo;ve cleared some major hurdles at this point.</p>

<p>And seriously, I need to write about <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink" title="DEVONthink, professional document and ...">DEVONthink</a> and how useful it was in all of this. I&rsquo;m hesitant because I have so much more to learn about it, but the more I talk about it and hear from other people, the more I realize that so many users are in the same boat: using it for specific reasons but feeling like they&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface of its capabilities. So I&rsquo;ll probably write about the subset of features I&rsquo;ve used for this specific research, rather than write <a href="https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/devonthink-3/">a whole book about it</a><sup id="fnref:tc"><a href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:tc" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Stay tuned.</p>
