<p>President Trump said he has an &quot;obligation&quot; to sue the BBC over how a Panorama documentary edited his Jan. 6 speech and has threatened legal action for at least $1 billion, accusing the broadcaster of misleading the public. The row follows a leaked internal memo and fierce public scrutiny that have contributed to the resignations of BBC director-general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness, and prompted Davie to rally staff to defend public-service journalism. Legal commentators say suing a major international public broadcaster raises complex jurisdictional and defamation hurdles, and the dispute has become a flashpoint in wider debates about trust in the BBC.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SeJ2idVL_3VQ_z72cXdCf4blO7JR40vBGYcmRKeKaWPG0LI74g7KWqBty4PeNwBVQ7QBWiiGF8LiKKRZ8K-MdKqXd2abPWXiY__sO5HWRAD1FRKgv56DIe8ssRKSDLgWFrerzLtbufgeSMKYPv6FVjZk9MsDf5DUE-qsQq4Y2e5XHzczlpyyldrRGl36z9AvHjAdS1Z-F49xLZYHlt3XgR--nHyeYQ' alt='President Trump speaking to a large crowd near the White House on Jan. 6, 2021.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Retraction demand: Trump&#x27;s lawyers gave the BBC a deadline to retract the documentary by Friday or face a lawsuit for &quot;no less&quot; than $1 billion, alleging the programme spliced together remarks that were more than 50 minutes apart.</li><li>Where to sue: His legal team has signalled a plan to file in Florida — where the president lists legal residency — a choice that raises questions about US jurisdiction over a UK public broadcaster.</li><li>Internal memo fallout: A leaked internal memo by a former BBC adviser accused editorial failings on coverage of Mr Trump and the Gaza conflict, escalating political pressure on the broadcaster&#x27;s leadership.</li><li>Public trust numbers: A snap YouGov poll cited after the resignations found roughly one-third of Britons believe the BBC displays a left‑wing bias, underscoring trust challenges facing the corporation.</li></ul><blockquote>We have made some mistakes that have cost us - Tim Davie</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He says he has an &quot;obligation&quot; to sue the BBC and has accused the broadcaster of defrauding the public by how it edited his remarks.
