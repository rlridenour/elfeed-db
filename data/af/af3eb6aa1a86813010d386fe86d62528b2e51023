is expanded with more functionality. I will update the manual accordingly.</p>

<hr />

<p>Today I wrote the initial version of the new optional extension
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence.el</code>, which is part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> package (current
development version is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.2.0-dev</code>). It provides commands to create
“sequence notes”, i.e. notes that have an inherent structure of
parent, child, or sibling. A sequence is expressed numerically, such
as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> being a parent, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1=1</code> the first child thereof, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1=2</code> the
sibling of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1=1</code> and child of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>In technical terms, this new extension leverages the optional
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGNATURE</code> file name component, per the Denote file-naming scheme
(read the manual, which is the source of truth—I write it for you).
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence.el</code> streamlines the creation of signatures to conform
with the aforementioned sequencing (in general, the signature file
name component is a free-form field that users can employ in any
workflow they want).</p>

<p>The new code is available on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequence-notes-extension</code> branch:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/tree/sequence-notes-extension">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/tree/sequence-notes-extension</a>.
Depending on when you read this, the branch may no longer exist as the
code is merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>.</p>

<p>Those of you who use Denote for your zettelkasten, please give
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence.el</code> a try. If it covers your use-case, let me know
what else you want to see as a feature. If it does not conform with
your requirements, please tell me if we can do something to make it
work for you.</p>

<p>The commands we provide as of this writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code>, which creates a new sequence note of type parent,
sibling, or child.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-new-parent</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-new-sibling</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-new-child</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is Denote</h2>

<p>Denote implements an efficient file-naming scheme that makes it easy
to retrieve files by their name. This is done by creating new files
(“notes”), or by renaming existing ones. For new files, Denote
supports any text format, with Org, Markdown, and plain text being
covered out-of-the-box. For renaming files, any file is supported
(e.g. I use Denote for all my videos).</p>

<p>As such, Denote is open-ended in terms of workflow. It is not just a
note-taking package, let alone one that is limited a specific
methodology, such as zettelkasten. Still, Denote can excel in those
use-cases, among others.</p>
