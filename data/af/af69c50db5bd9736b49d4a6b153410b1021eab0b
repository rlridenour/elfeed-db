The Premium Plus plan that features limited ads in live programming is also increasing in price from &#36;13.99 to &#36;16.99. Yearly pricing for the Premium plan will be &#36;110, and the Premium Plus yearly price will be &#36;170.<br/>
<br/>
This is the third price increase that Peacock has introduced in the last three years, and <em>Variety</em> claims that NBCUniversal executives believe that the service is underpriced compared to competing streaming services.<br/>
<br/>
At &#36;11 per month, Peacock's ad-supported tier will be more expensive than ad-supported options from Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and Paramount+. Peacock is testing a lower-priced "Select" plan that features NBC and Bravo current seasons and a limited number of library titles. The plan will be priced at &#36;7.99 per month.<br/>

While price increases will hit new subscribers on July 23, existing subscribers can expect to have to pay the higher fees starting after August 22 depending on their next billing date.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/peacock/">Peacock</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/peacock-price-increase/">Peacock Streaming Service Gets &#36;3 Price Hike</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/peacock-streaming-service-gets-3-price-hike.2461743/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
