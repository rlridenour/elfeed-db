Problem Every time I put my cursor in code with an error, or even while i&rsquo;m typing something that is as yet unfinished, I have a new buffer pop up &ldquo;Flycheck Error Messages&rdquo;, which then disappears again when I have finished typing. I can&rsquo;t find a relevant setting. How do I stop this disruption, maybe only having error messages in the modeline?
Answer The following variable controls whether the new buffers occupy a new window or, as I desired, can be just in the minibuffer.
