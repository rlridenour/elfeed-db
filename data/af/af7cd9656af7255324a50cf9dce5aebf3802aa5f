<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Affirming that I am not beholden to a blog posting schedule; and that others also recognize the joy of writing when the spirit moves them.
</p>
        <p>I have been a bit quite; in part because I’ve been focusing on migrating to
<span><a href="https://linux.org/">Linux</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Linux”" title="Other site-wide references of “Linux”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-LINUX">&#128214;</a></small>
.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> See Hello from Linux.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>And with that migration wrapping up, I started catching up on my <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" title="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-RSS">&#128214;</a></small>
.  The
following popped up and it made me think:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite" cite="https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-renewal">

I started the year with the secret goal of posting on this blog daily. And I
managed to do that in January only to discover that posting daily isn’t fun and
was making me hate the whole experience.

<p>In <time datetime="2024" title="2024">2024</time> I started the year with an energy for the <code>#Lore24</code> challenge.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> <a href="https://takeonrules.com/tags/lore24/">See my posts tagged #Lore24</a>.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
  Yet that
quickly waned; as I knew it would.</p>
<p>Why?  Because I have structured my blog to follow my energy; not some temporal
construct.  When I first started my blog, I was working in a Marketing and
Communications department.</p>
<p>The director encouraged us to write and added, “You need to publish on a
schedule.”  When I started my blog I followed that advice for a month or so.</p>
<p>But found that publishing to a schedule meant treating my blog as an
obligation…something I needed to feed.  And I didn’t like that relationship.  So
I re-oriented and write and publish when “the spirit moves me.”</p>
<p>Yet I continue to embark on challenges…knowing that I won’t complete them but
instead treat these as a bit of exploration.</p>
<p>Later, Manuel writes:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

Over the past few weeks, I realized that this space I built for myself is more
important than I realized for my mental sanity.

<p>Very much this!</p>
