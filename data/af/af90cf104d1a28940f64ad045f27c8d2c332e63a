That said, one thing I’m finding interesting is that I see people falling into
two main camps for the most part. On one side are those who value output and
outcome, and how to get there doesn’t seem to matter a lot to them. And on the
other are the people who value the process over the result, those who care more
about how you get to something and what you learn along the way.

<h2 id="gray-haired-guy">Gray Haired Guy</h2>
<p>I’m of a generation in which my fellow Gen X-ers might have had a home computer;
something with 64 <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte">Kilobytes</a></span> (<abbr title="Kilobytes">kBs</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Kilobytes”" title="Other site-wide references of “Kilobytes”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-KB">&#128214;</a></small>)
 of memory.  The machine I’m writing on now has 96 <span>Gigabytes</span> (<abbr title="Gigabytes">GBs</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Gigabytes”" title="Other site-wide references of “Gigabytes”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GB">&#128214;</a></small>)
 of
memory; that is 7 orders of magnitude more.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> A personal strategy from years of computer use and efforts to ensure the
greatest lifetime of the computer has been: get the most memory available.  I
have done that with this machine.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>In that bygone era, there were computer magazines that would distribute programs
printed on the page.  If the program sounded interesting, you might transcribe
it into your computer and then run it.  Hopefully you had a means of saving that
to some kind of floppy drive, so you wouldn’t need to type it again.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of what would provide me with affordable access to the
machine(s) that I use for my career.  I’m a software engineer, and in having
access to these computing machines outside of my employer, I am able to explore
the process of using a computer; that is telling it what to do.</p>
<p>I have, if you will, been able to seize the means of production.  Which, per
Manuel’s post, which places me further along the “how you get to something and
what you learn along the way” path.</p>
<h2 id="the-fog-of-war">The Fog of War</h2>
<p>There is a tremendous effort happening to (re)capture those means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obfuscate the underlying capabilities of the computer through interface design.</li>
<li>Chatter about scale; as though all computing problems are a matter of serving
billions of requests per second, and needing telemetry throughout that
process.</li>
<li>Philosophical statements such as “working code wins.”</li>
<li>Moving towards the “cloud”; that is “make it the problem of someone else (<em>but
now remain beholden to someone else to resolve your problems</em>).”</li>
</ul>
<p>Were I moving towards the “value output and outcome” pole, these enclosing
strategies (and I’m sure there are many more) might not be an issue.</p>
<p>I read the “output and outcome” focus as an echo of the phrase: the ends justify
the means.</p>
<h2 id="to-start-a-fire">To Start a Fire</h2>
<p>I recently watched a television show where it was clear that the person trying
to light a fire was fully dependent on the abundance of lighter fluid.  They
eventually started a fire from the small split logs, only through sustained
application of lighter fluid.</p>
<p>Myself, I’ve started enough fires to know that you gather bits of dry brush;
using that as what will be the heart of the fire.  Then place twigs as the rib
cage of that heart.  The twigs creating a cone.  Then you bring flame and a
gentle breath to stoke the embers.</p>
<p>And at the moment the fire catches, you add small bits of fuel until the twigs
catch.  Then you add larger twigs.</p>
<p>I’m by no means an expert at this, but feel that the process is important.  I
need less captured-by-other-people material to start a fire.</p>
<p>In this scenario, I understand more details of the process of starting a fire.
And would wager that my fire starting skills are more durable than the person on
TV.</p>
<h2 id="predictive-generation">Predictive Generation</h2>

, or more appropriately an <span>Large Language Model</span> (<abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Large Language Model”" title="Other site-wide references of “Large Language Model”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-LLM">&#128214;</a></small>)
, is a predictive engine.  I throw at it a bunch
of words, in which the order and specific words are akin to a randomizing
seed.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> In words provided is only part of that interactions random seed.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
 And the <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>
 uses that randomization to plot a course through a word
ocean.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> Well, a symbol ocean, in which a symbol might be a string of words or a
chunk of code.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>

</p>
<p>And in no time, out comes a response.  How did it get there?  Does it matter
if we are of that outcome oriented mindset?  And what are the knock-on affects
of this outcome orientation…for me, for you, for my children, for my neighbor,
for our neighborhood, for our planet?</p>
<p>Because these outcome accelerants do use tremendous time; namely in consuming
vast amounts of stored energy from time past; and that heat of yesteryear is
itself cooled by the melt of glaciers either now or those found in our
reservoirs once fed by a prior ice age.</p>
<p>Inflaming our future, by burning and spilling our past, generating a disposable
and cheapened present moment.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I know I don’t want to get better at not knowing how to do things.  And I look
at the computering skills I’ve developed, and would prefer to not slide into a
need to lease/rent the tools, and even mental processes, that I use.  I also
do not want participate in this particular exercise of tossing accelerant on our
plant and lighting a match.</p>
<p>And looking to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy effect</a>; the knowledge and skills that I’ve already
gained are likely to be more useful than the knowledge of “prompt engineering.”
Especially considering that prompt engineering is learning how to “use the
company’s machine.”</p>
<p>Re-framing, I find a greater general durability in developing processes, knowing
how they contribute towards the outcome, then adjust the process.  It is this
introspection that I value.  And look to the outcome as a byproduct of what I
value.</p>
