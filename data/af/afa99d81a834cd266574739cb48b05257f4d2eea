<p>The cloud is an invisible cage.<br>A soft leash.<br>Wrapped in convenience. Masked as innovation.</p>



<p>Prices are high &#8211; yet you&#8217;re not the customer.<br>You&#8217;re the product.<br>Your data is kidnapped, repackaged, and shared.<br>Papers, please? Already printed.</p>

<p>Ghost Ops demand silence.<br>No ads. No pings. No leaks.<br>A system that breathes locally.<br>Watched only by its Operator.</p>



<p>Self-hosting doesn&#8217;t demand a bunker or supercomputers in the basement.<br>A Raspberry Pi on a desk is enough.<br>External disks hold the memory. Encrypted. Redundant.<br>Cold when not in use.</p>



<p>Internet-facing services are few.<br>Only what&#8217;s needed.<br>And even then, shielded.</p>



<p>A cheap VPS stands as the front line &#8211;<br>A reverse proxy.<br>No home IPs. No open trails.<br>The tunnel runs quiet.<br>VPN wraps the noise.</p>



<p>Ghosts don&#8217;t leave footsteps.<br>They don&#8217;t ask permission.<br>They build their own shelter in the noise and vanish.</p>

<p>This stack is not a rulebook. It&#8217;s a compass.<br>Ghosts don&#8217;t copy systems. They shape them to their silence.<br>Start small. Stay lean. Stay local.<br>When in doubt &#8211; pull the plug, back up, rebuild.<br>You are the system now.</p>
