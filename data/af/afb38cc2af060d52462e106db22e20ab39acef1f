Now through July 7, customers who apply for an Apple Card will receive &#36;100 in extra Daily Cash when they spend &#36;500 or more within the first 60 days of opening the account. You must apply for the Apple Card <a href="https://learn.applecard.apple/offer">via the offer page</a> to be eligible for the bonus.<br/>
<br/>
The bonus is provided in addition to any regular Daily Cash that is earned. When paying with the Apple Card via Apple Pay, you can receive 3% back on purchases from Apple, Nike, Uber, Walgreens, and select other merchants in the U.S., and 2% back on all other purchases. When paying with the physical Apple Card, Daily Cash is limited to 1%.<br/>

It is common for credit cards to offer sign-up bonuses tied to minimum spending requirements, and there have been several Apple Card offers over the years.<br/>

Launched in 2019, Apple's credit card remains available in the U.S. only. The card can be managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, with key benefits including color-coded spending summaries, no fees, and Daily Cash cash back paid out daily.
