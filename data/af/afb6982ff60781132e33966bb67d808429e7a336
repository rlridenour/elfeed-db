<p>In the latest diplomatic push to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, US special envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow on Tuesday to present a revised American peace proposal to President Vladimir Putin, with the White House saying it is “very optimistic” about the chances of a deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the updated plan being circulated between Kyiv, Moscow and Washington “looks better” than an earlier version, but stressed that questions over control of Ukrainian territory remain the most difficult part of the negotiations. Russia continues to demand recognition of its control over multiple Ukrainian regions, while Kyiv insists on security guarantees, sovereignty and territorial integrity, raising fears among some European leaders that Ukraine could come under pressure to accept territorial concessions. As Witkoff shuttles between the parties, European governments are publicly rallying behind Zelenskyy, and Ukraine’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov has described recent US‑Ukrainian talks as having made “significant progress” even though several key issues are still unresolved.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/XS8h84atyU_XvFPsZX3Yi7mmrpea_yshjFGT59e0c5RFTQBrXcjq77Vga2QzAVgB36xlM5zhTgbEEwUBu4E6Mf6wG6MrxheifwzbA2AG1hzgjf_SdCbvuADcOMTgchOwqjeY6h_7C1Ni3lO3UNsU1vd9oSGoFYnkeTSpr3vtGw1MseWH-tDO2OHJeB9tk__1t64RjvKffvfmhkqD6v0' alt='US special envoy Steve Witkoff, appointed by President Trump, speaks to reporters at the White House ahead of his trip to Moscow for Ukraine peace talks.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>US role: President Trump has tasked real estate investor Steve Witkoff as his special envoy, and he previously held two days of discussions with Ukrainian officials in Florida before heading to Moscow with the latest version of the American proposal.</li><li>Russian demands: Maps circulating among negotiators show that President Putin seeks international acceptance of Russian control over five Ukrainian regions, including areas in the Donbas and southern Ukraine, as part of his red lines for any settlement.</li><li>Ukrainian priorities: Zelenskyy has underlined that Ukraine’s key conditions include long‑term security guarantees, restoration of sovereignty and protection of internationally recognized borders, and that Russia must not gain benefits from its military action.</li><li>European concerns: EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and other European leaders have warned that direct US‑Russia talks risk shifting pressure onto Kyiv, and they emphasize that Russia started and continues the war with attacks on civilians and infrastructure.</li><li>Next political steps: Zelenskyy has said he expects to discuss “key issues” directly with President Trump after Witkoff returns from Moscow, following his own consultations in Paris and other European capitals.</li></ul><blockquote>The territorial issue is the most difficult. - Volodymyr Zelenskyy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukrainian government: Zelenskyy says the redrafted US peace plan “looks better” than the initial 28‑point version but reiterates that questions over Ukrainian territory and sovereignty remain the hardest part of the talks.
