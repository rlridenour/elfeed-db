</ul><h1>Try One</h1><p>Are hoverboards cool?</p>
<p>Or are they uncool?</p>
<p>Or have they gotten <em>so</em> uncool that now they are, against all odds, very cool in an ironic way?</p>
<p>We don’t know. All we know is that we’re selling one for about 80 bucks, which is a hundred dollars cheaper than you’ll get it on Amazon. Seriously, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hover-1-Electric-Hoverboard-Lasting-Battery/dp/B01IDU4TDW?th=1&tag=mehdown-20">go check</a>. Oh, and while you’re there, maybe read some reviews, because they’re pretty impressive. We’re talking an average rating of 4.1 out of 5, based on almost 4000 reviews.</p>
<p>What we are saying is that this thing is good, and people like it.</p>
<p>But, despite this, it falls into one of the riskier types of products for us to sell.</p>
<p>There are our mainstays, like snacks and cheap gadgets. Maybe you love them, maybe you don’t. But they’re priced right, so that even if you hate them, you’re not too put out.</p>
<p>Then there are smaller, practical products: power banks, lanterns, handheld vacuums, et cetera. Exciting? No. But if you buy them, you’re almost definitely going to get some use out of them.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we’ve got our more expensive stuff: those big battery generators, a nice vacuum, fancy earbuds, Danish speakers. Sure, while cheaper here than anywhere else, these things are not usually priced at ‘aw, hell, why not?!’ impulse buy prices. But you at least <em>sort of</em> know what you’re going to get. You might not have had an upright Shark or a pair of Beats before, but you have had vacuums and you have had headphones.</p>
<p>This, on the other hand? It’s a great deal, but it’s still 80 bucks. If you’ve never used a hoverboard before, you’ll basically be going in blind.</p>
<p>And yet, there’s also something fun there, right? Like, you could order the best earbuds ever, and all you’ll think is, <em>It’s going to be cool to listen to the same stuff I always listen to but with better sound.</em> Whereas this hoverboard presents an entirely new experience. Sure, you might not like it, but what if you <em>love</em> it? What if you discover this is the way you’ve always wanted to move, you just were never given a chance to realize it? And you could save more than a hundred dollars in the process? Wouldn’t that be rad?</p>
<p>In conclusion: please buy a hoverboard.</p>
