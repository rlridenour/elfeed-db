<p>Nicole Mitchell of the Glasgow Times <a href="https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/scottish-news/25446320.glasgow-residents-complain-excessive-noise-filming/">reports about a commercial shoot in late August</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Concerns have been raised about “excessive noise” during a recent commercial film shoot. </p>
<p>  <a href="https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/topics/merchant-city/">Merchant City</a> and Trongate Community Council (MCTCC) say they received a complaint from a local resident about the noise and “other disruption” during filming which took place on Cochrane Street from Saturday, August 23 to Wednesday, August 27. </p>
<p>  It’s understood the filming was for an Apple advert. A video taken of the shoot and shared by the Glasgow Times showed one actor ‘floating’ down from the roof of a building.

<p>Hmm. An Apple advertisement featuring an actor floating down from the roof while using their iPhone? Seems like that might be promoting a very light iPhone of some sort.</p>
<p>I suppose we’ll find out <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">sooner or later</a>. (<strong>Update</strong>: Yep, it’s the iPhone Air all right.)</p>
