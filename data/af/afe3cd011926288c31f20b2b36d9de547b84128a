If you are planning to head to the Apple Park Visitor Center this month, be aware that the rooftop terrace will be temporarily closed.<br/>

Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/appleparkvisitorcenter/">says</a> the rooftop terrace will be receiving some unspecified "improvements," and it will be closed until Monday, September 1 as a result.<br/>
<br/>
The notice was added to the Apple Park Visitor Center page within the past 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
When open, the rooftop terrace offers a partial view of Apple Park, and there are tables and chairs for sitting around. It can be reached via stairs or an elevator, and there is also a bathroom on that level. It is unclear what changes are planned.<br/>
<br/>
Tourists headed to the Apple Park Visitor Center still have plenty to do. They can try out the latest Apple products, purchase Apple merchandise, grab a coffee at the on-site Caffè Macs, view a 3D model of the Apple Park campus, get creative with free "Today at Apple" sessions, and stroll through the adjacent <a href="https://mirage.place/">"Mirage" public art installation</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Park Visitor Center opened in November 2017. It is located directly across the street from Apple Park, in Cupertino, California.<br/>
