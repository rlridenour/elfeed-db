Apple's two-generations-away iPhone 18 Pro models will likely feature under-screen Face ID, according <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles">to <em>The Information</em></a>.<br/>

The paywalled report today cited a source who said the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max will have only a small hole in top-left corner of the screen, to accommodate the front-facing camera, with all Face ID hardware moved under the screen.<br/>
<br/>
With under-screen Face ID, the report said the iPhone 18 Pro models would no longer have a pill-shaped cutout at the top of the screen. However, it is unclear if that means the Dynamic Island feature would be discontinued.<br/>
