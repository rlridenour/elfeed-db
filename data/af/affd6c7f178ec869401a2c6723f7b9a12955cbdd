<p>Nine minutes, short and sweet. I watched the whole thing and loved it. If it had been pre-recorded, I bet I wouldn’t have gotten more than two or three minutes into it, even though the video would have been more polished. There’s just something compelling about a live demo, even when you’re watching on YouTube.</p>

<p>(The new PencilVac looks cool too, but it seems too good to be true. I’ll be interested to hear from reviewers whether it, uh, actually sucks or kinda sucks.)</p>
