New <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> lead Mike Rockwell is overhauling the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; management team in order to step up development on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-22/apple-s-new-siri-chief-mike-rockwell-overhauls-management-to-start-turnaround">Bloomberg</a></em>. He is demoting or replacing the managers who previously worked on &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; after the &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features demonstrated at WWDC 2024 failed to launch as expected.<br/>

Rockwell, who worked on the Vision Pro software, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/">took over the Siri team</a> in March, with former &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; chief John Giannandrea being reassigned to artificial intelligence research. Rockwell is replacing &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; managers with members of the Vision Pro software group, while also restructuring &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; teams that handle speech, understanding, performance, and user experience.<br/>
<br/>
Longtime Vision Pro engineering lead Ranjit Desai will oversee &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; engineering, including the platform and systems groups. Vision Pro senior director Olivier Gutknecht will lead the team that designs the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; user experience, and Vision Pro engineering director Nate Begeman and Core OS senior director Tom Duffy will work on &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s underlying architecture.<br/>
<br/>
Employees were told that the management overhaul would help Apple reach its &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; development goals, as the additions to the team are considered some of Apple's top software engineering talent, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>.<br/>
<br/>
Rockwell is still overseeing the development of visionOS while he works on &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, while the Vision Pro hardware team continues to report to John Ternus. Teams that were led by the executives moving to the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; team will be overseen by Geoff Stahl, who has worked for Rockwell for years.<br/>
<br/>
Under Rockwell's lead, Apple is rearchitecting &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to use an LLM-based system that will streamline the personal assistant's underlying technology and outward-facing capabilities. To ensure that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s planned functionality for integrating more extensively with apps is ready to go on time, Apple plans to work with third-party app developers.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/siri-management-team-overhaul/">Siri Management Team Gets Overhaul After Apple Intelligence Failure</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/siri-management-team-gets-overhaul-after-apple-intelligence-failure.2455772/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
