Charles Choi has posted a tip mostly, he says, as a reminder to his future self. It&rsquo;s about <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/sorting-strings-in-a-line-in-emacs.html">how to sort strings on a single Emacs line</a>. At first blush that may not seem all that useful but a moment&rsquo;s thought will bring to mind all sorts of situations where it&rsquo;s just what you need.
</p>
<p>
The secret sauce is <code>sort-regexp-fields</code>, which actually sorts a region whether or not it&rsquo;s on a single line. When called interactively, you will need to supply two regexes. The first is used to identify the record and the second to identify the key of that record.
</p>
<p>
If you specify a match field in the record regex, you can use a match number (<code>\n</code>) for the key regex. If the key is the whole field, you can use <code>\&amp;</code>.
</p>
<p>
Choi has an example that shows how to sort quote-delimited strings on a single line and the documentation has an example of sorting lines by the first word that starts with <code>f</code>. The documentation example shows how powerful the method really is.
</p>
<p>
In any event, this post is partially a reminder to future me and you should bookmark Choi&rsquo;s post to remind yourself how to do it. It&rsquo;s another one of those things that you don&rsquo;t need very often but when you do, you&rsquo;ll be really glad to have a reminder of how to do it.</p>
