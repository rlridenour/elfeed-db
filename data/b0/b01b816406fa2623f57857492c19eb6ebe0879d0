</ul><h1>Two-Packs of Horror: An April Fools’ Meh-rathon</h1><p><strong>Josh’s pitch</strong></p>
<p>At the slumber party, the girls gave Cassie a Bluetooth speaker disguised as a cute purse. They couldn’t wait to blast fart sounds from it from their phones for some silly April fun.</p>
<p>As Cassie hid in the laundry room after seeing the knife-wielding maniac slip through the door, she squeezed the purse tightly. She just needed to stay silent.</p>
<p>See how that goes in… <em>April Fools</em>!</p>
<p><strong>Sean’s pitch</strong></p>
<p>Kimmy is so offended by the April Fools’ Day prank that she grabs her Make Lemonade Fuzzy Purse Bluetooth Speaker and leaves school immediately.</p>
<p>Or, she thinks it’s her Make Lemonade Fuzzy Purse Bluetooth Speaker.</p>
<p>Only, why is it growling? Is this <em>another</em> prank? Or something much worse?</p>
<p>Find out in… <em>April Fools</em>!</p>

<p><em>We can all agree, April Fools’ Day is awful on the internet. So we decided, why not make April Fools’ Day more like Halloween? It’s simple. All day long, we’ve got two-packs of products and two pitches for April-Fools’-Day-themed horror movies based on said products. So stick around for great deals and, frankly, terrible movie ideas.</em></p>
