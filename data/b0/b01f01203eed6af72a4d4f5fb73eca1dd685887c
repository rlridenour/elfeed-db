<p>Magyar, which is spoken and written in Hungary, ranks among the hardest European languages to learn. (The <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2017/11/a-map-showing-how-much-time-it-takes-to-learn-foreign-languages-from-easiest-to-hardest.html">U.S.&nbsp;Foreign Service Institute</a> puts it in the second-to-highest level, accompanied by the dreaded asterisk labeling it as “usually more difficult than other languages in the same category.”) But once you master its vowel harmony system, its definite and indefinite conjugation, and its&nbsp;eighteen grammatical cases, among other notorious features,&nbsp;you can finally enjoy the work of writers like Nobel Laureates Imre Kertész and László Krasznahorkai in the original. Alas,&nbsp;no degree of mastery will be much help if you want to understand a much older — and, in its way, much more notorious — Hungarian text, the Rohonc Codex.</p>

<p>“Little is known about this book before it was bequeathed to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1838,” <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2021/07/20/fascinated-by-the-voynich-manuscript-here-are-some-other-mysterious-texts-you-can-decode">writes <em>The Art Newspaper</em>’s Garry Shaw</a>. “Its 448 pages bear illustrations covering Biblical themes and an as yet unreadable text, written using around 150 different symbols.”</p>

<p><a href="https://real-ms.mtak.hu/80/6/Rohonci_Codex_K_114cs.pdf">Download this PDF scan of the Rohonc Codex</a>, and you can behold for yourself both its often charmingly simple medieval-style illustrations — many of which exhibit a mixture of Christian, Pagan, and Muslim symbolism — and the fiendishly regular-looking script against which generations of would-be decipherers have banged their heads. Here in the twenty-twenties, perhaps artificial intelligence can do its part, as has been attempted with the <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2025/01/explore-a-digitized-edition-of-the-voynich-manuscript-the-worlds-most-mysterious-book.html">Voynich Manuscript</a>, to build upon earlier analyses. One of those, conducted in the early nineteen-seventies, determined that, whatever the language in which the Rohonc Codex was written, it shows no traces of case endings. To enthusiasts of bizarre manuscripts, that discovery probably means little, but to students of Magyar, nothing could come as a greater relief.</p>
