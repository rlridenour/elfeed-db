<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, a license ($36 value) for <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a>. That&rsquo;s right, another chance at Keyboard Maestro! Keyboard Maestro is an insanely powerful app for automation on your Mac that no power user should be without. It can automate literally everything. Power users will love it, but everyday users can greatly benefit from the shortcuts and triggers that Keyboard Maestro offers with a simple drag-and-drop configuration.</p>

Let Keyboard Maestro help make your Mac life more pleasant and efficient. With so many possible actions that you can combine together, including flow control, conditions and looping actions, you can automate almost any task, from the trivial to very complex multi-application reporting systems.</p>
