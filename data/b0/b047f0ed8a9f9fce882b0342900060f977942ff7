<p>The United States announced an additional $6 million in humanitarian aid for Cuba as the island faces worsening fuel shortages and blackouts, even as Washington also steps up efforts to block oil shipments to Cuba. Cuba’s President Miguel Díaz-Canel accused the U.S. of imposing an “energy blockade,” and said his government will roll out a contingency plan—including rationing measures—in the coming week to manage the shortage. He said Cuba is willing to engage in dialogue with the United States, but only “without pressure” and without interference in Cuba’s internal affairs.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/5vCWWWZwpWfvJix0dA-aGra1ltbyy-Nj0o3de9BunEFn6m4CW4f9VUxy8yBBke4HvLts_6-jDvdNLfuvGEnjB-ZNui8PGgX5yr77t8XWULxOJO_xjXTJ1VJWI8xrgeebPJGgHqTSsiVR6iB2lVcp_IshPt6Mh4NsGxedn1h2IfafSF-JpXZaGfbjG1czHyTVITaLYZKaVvk' alt='Cuba faces persistent power outages amid fuel shortages and rising US-Cuba tensions.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Aid focus: U.S. officials said the new funding is humanitarian support as Cuba continues recovering from Hurricane Melissa’s impacts in the eastern regions.</li><li>Two-faced claim: Cuba’s deputy foreign minister Carlos Fernández de Cossío called Washington’s stance—offering aid while tightening fuel pressure—“two-faced”.</li><li>Tariff threat: Mexican officials are exploring ways to supply fuel to Cuba without triggering threatened U.S. tariffs aimed at countries that provide oil to the island, according to sources.</li><li>Local hardship: Reporting from a small Cuban coastal town describes residents still dealing with repeated outages despite being surrounded by energy infrastructure—oil production and a large thermoelectric plant—underscoring bottlenecks beyond generation capacity.</li><li>Rhetoric rising: President Trump has publicly threatened to cut off Cuba’s access to oil and urged Cuba to reach a deal with Washington.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Cuban government (Miguel Díaz-Canel): Díaz-Canel accused the U.S. of running “intense media campaigns of slander, hatred and psychological warfare” against Cuba, and said any talks must be on respectful terms.
