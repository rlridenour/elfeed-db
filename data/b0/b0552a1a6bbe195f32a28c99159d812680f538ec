Apple Music could get more visual flair in iOS 26 with full-screen animated artwork coming to the Lock Screen, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>.<br/>

The rumored feature would expand on recent changes to the Lock Screen's Now Playing view. Currently, maximized album artwork from the Now Playing widget tints the entire interface, creating a more immersive experience when controlling music playback.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 appears set to take that concept further by introducing animated artwork that fills the entire Lock Screen, making album covers and other visuals more dynamic and engaging.<br/>
<br/>
The new iOS 26 features are expected to be unveiled at the WWDC keynote event on Monday, June 9. It starts at 10:00 a.m. and while Apple will livestream it, if you can't watch, you can follow along here on MacRumors.com or on our <a href="https://x.com/macrumorslive">MacRumorsLive X account</a>.
