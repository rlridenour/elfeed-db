He says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>There’s no lever, no bystanders, and no tracks&#8212;just a mosquito net between a child and a parasite. Bed nets stop malaria; malaria stops lives; you stop reading this and donate some bed nets. Consequentialists and deontologists approve, virtue ethicists call it a habit worth cultivating, skeptics shrug and donate anyway.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Every year, philosophy departments around the world enter a friendly &#8216;competition&#8217; to raise money for bed nets that protect people from malaria. Malaria kills more than a thousand children each day. These deaths are as unnecessary as they are tragic. So, every year during the festive season, philosophers put ethical quarrels, exotic thought experiments, and devastating objections aside for a minute to pitch in for those less fortunate than them.</em></p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You can access the fundraiser <strong><a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/FundraiserGroup.aspx?FundraiserID=9418">here</a></strong>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Sharing the fundraiser via social media, mailing lists, or other means is highly encouraged!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>All donations are tax-deductible, and 100% of donations go to the purchase of long-lasting insecticidal bed nets. Long-lasting insecticidal nets cost around $2 and provide effective protection to the households that receive them.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The Against Malaria Foundation has an excellent track record in distributing such bed nets. In the last 19 years, the 250 million nets they funded and distributed protected 450 million people. It is <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fkft56o8Md2HmjSP7/amf-reflecting-on-2023-and-looking-ahead-to-2024#Impact">estimated</a> that this translates to roughly 185,000 deaths prevented, and 100 to 185 million cases of malaria averted. It is also estimated to have led to an improvement of US$6.5 billion in local economies since malaria is a crucial factor in reducing the productivity of those it affects. AMF has been rated as a top charity by <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf">GiveWell</a>, a charity evaluator, each year since 2009.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/FundraiserGroup.aspx?FundraiserID=9189">Previous editions of</a> this heated competition funded 28.853 bednets and had Oxford (2022), Michigan (2023) and Delaware (2024) be declared winners.</em></p>
