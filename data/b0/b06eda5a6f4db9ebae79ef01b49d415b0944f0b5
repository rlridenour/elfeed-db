         <p>At 11:00 AM Europe/Athens, I will start streaming my work on some of
the Emacs packages I have authored and maintain. I will engage with
the chat, if there are any comments, but my focus will be on the code.</p>

<p>The packages I plan to cover are denote, denote-org, denote-sequence,
doric-themes. Depending on how it goes, I will work on more of my
packages.</p>

<p><strong>The video will be recorded and can be watched later.</strong></p>
