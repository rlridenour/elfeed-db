<p>One of the missing pieces about databases for me has been what to use for
backups. I recently decided to go with <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a> and it seems to be working okay so far.</p>
<p>My backup script looks somethnig like this. It pings <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">healthchecks.io</a> when it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 /data/requests.sqlite &quot;VACUUM INTO '/tmp/requests.sqlite'&quot;
gzip /tmp/requests.sqlite

restic -r s3://s3.amazonaws.com/MY_BUCKET/ backup /tmp/requests.sqlite.gz 
restic -r s3://s3.amazonaws.com/MY_BUCKET/ forget -l 7 -H 12 -d 2 -w 2 -m 2 -y 2
restic -r s3://s3.amazonaws.com/MY_BUCKET/ prune
curl https://hc-ping.com/ID
</code></pre>
