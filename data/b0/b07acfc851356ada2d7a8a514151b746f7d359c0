<p>When I went to the bookstore and picked up <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781472281067">Dawn</a> by Octavia E. Butler 📚, I didn&rsquo;t know who she was, or, more likely, I forgot. I was looking for something a bit sci-fi after my previous <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593298909">semi-scientific Owl book</a>. Dawn, which I saw was about a dystopian future involving aliens from the book cover, seemed intriguing.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; I was wrong. Every episode seems to be like a dialogue between the main character and one of her alien abdoctors, and they are all pretty much the same. I get that there&rsquo;s a point to be made here, perhaps, but it got old fast. I&rsquo;m learning to appreciate books that invite me to read them and dread those that I put away in favor of my RSS feeds.</p>
