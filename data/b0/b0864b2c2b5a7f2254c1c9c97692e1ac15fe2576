<p>A bus carrying Indian Umrah pilgrims collided with a diesel tanker near Medina in the early hours of Monday, killing dozens and leaving a single reported survivor, Indian officials said; Indian counts range from 42 to 45 dead across reports. Many of the travellers were reported to be from Hyderabad, and India’s embassy in Riyadh and consulate in Jeddah are coordinating with Saudi authorities to assist victims’ families and carry out last rites for those who died, Indian officials said. The crash has reopened concerns about road safety for pilgrims in Saudi Arabia, which has seen previous deadly pilgrim transport accidents and retains a high road-fatality rate by U.N. measures.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ruK_YHvf5pfjWXUF5Fl4zX19WHVhp81G4SzZ-bSXJJBgJRykMneZ_tXKSBDFD-4g4evbyCjDdNm-TqBMxIjqBBijvbWTEmmfth5Qwu-SloeKYVR7wXkBhbsBK8lmCvrYVcrR9XYFSqUQIOEDwVDNEdvB6iKp6z7pa_xdF1zZb6OVncGSi0Lc_rx7UJA' alt='Family members of the victims of a bus crash in Saudi Arabia mourned in Hyderabad, India, home to many of the passengers, on Monday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Group origin: Authorities and local officials said a large share of the passengers came from Hyderabad, prompting intense local grief and official updates from that city’s police commissioner</li><li>Government response: Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted condolences and New Delhi said its embassy and consulate were providing consular support and liaising with Saudi authorities on the ground</li><li>Reporting discrepancies: Initial media counts varied—some outlets reported at least 42 deaths while others listed 45—reflecting rapidly changing tallies from Indian officials and local sources</li><li>Safety context: Transporting worshippers between holy sites has repeatedly posed risks in Saudi Arabia; a 2023 collision that caused a bus to burst into flames killed about 20 people and raised safety concerns</li></ul><blockquote>Deeply saddened by the accident in Medina involving Indian nationals.
