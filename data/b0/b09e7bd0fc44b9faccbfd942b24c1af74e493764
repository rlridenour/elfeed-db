<blockquote>
  <p>Nine-inning games during the 2025 season have, on average, clocked
in at 2 hours, 38 minutes through Thursday, marking the third
straight season in which the average game time was 2:40 or
shorter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regular Season nine-inning @MLB games of three hours and thirty
minutes (3:30) or longer:</p>

<ul>
<li>2021: 391</li>
<li>2022: 232</li>
<li>2023: 9</li>
<li>2024: 7</li>
<li>2025: 3 (through 9/25)</li>

<p>The trend marks the first time since 1983-85 that the average
nine-inning game time was 2:40 or shorter in three consecutive
seasons. The average nine-inning game time was 2:36 last season
and 2:40 in 2023.</p>

<p>I disagree with many of MLB’s recent rules changes (e.g. the 10th-inning “Manfred Man” ghost runners), but the pitch clock and limit on mound visits have been unambiguous changes for the better. They don’t make the game feel hurried at all, but prior to the pitch clock, the game often felt ponderous.</p>
