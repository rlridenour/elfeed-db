<p>A National Security Council memorandum issued Friday bars credentialed reporters from entering a West Wing office called &quot;Upper Press&quot; without a prior appointment, a change that takes effect immediately and affects the area adjacent to the Oval Office where the press secretary works . The White House framed the move as necessary to protect &quot;sensitive material,&quot; while Communications Director Steven Cheung said reporters had been &quot;ambushing&quot; officials and secretly recording conversations, claims the administration says justify the restriction . Reporters will still have access to other press areas, and the decision comes amid a wider pattern of access rules from the administration, including recent Pentagon policies some outlets refused to sign .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/P-LSI_kcw9w0VBrfnQTkGRB1ImeMZPeCvVFpEfnhrCfqC9AFWiDJcNphjIqeSwh62hcFv3rDx-mOWTmICa0e55EEU3088D5wBaYGfMRrHfX2' alt='White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt takes questions from reporters during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, DC on October 23, 2025. — Reuters' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Specific room: The order targets Room 140 in the West Wing, commonly called &quot;Upper Press,&quot; which sits close to the Oval Office and houses senior communications staff .</li><li>Appointment rule: Under the new policy, reporters must set an appointment to approach press secretary staff in Upper Press rather than freely visiting the space to seek comment .</li><li>NSC rationale: The memorandum cites recent structural changes to the National Security Council and the need to prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive material as reasons for the restriction .</li><li>Media pushback: The move is part of a broader set of access policies this month — the Pentagon issued new media rules earlier that at least one major outlet, AFP, refused to sign ; outlets and journalists have described this White House step as a further tightening of press access .</li></ul><blockquote>This memorandum directs the prohibition of press passholders from accessing … ‘Upper Press,’ which is situated adjacent to the Oval Office, without an appointment, - White House memorandum</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House communications officials: Officials said the restriction protects sensitive material and defended the change by saying reporters had been &#x27;ambushing&#x27; cabinet secretaries and secretly recording, which they argued necessitated appointment-only access .
