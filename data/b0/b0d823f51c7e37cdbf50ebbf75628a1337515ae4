<p>Dr. Vacek was given the award in recognition of her work on responsibility and artificial intelligence, which has focused on responsibility not merely for harms and problems caused by AI or its use, but also for successful, beneficial, creative, or otherwise praiseworthy developments, uses, or effects of AI.

<p>Dr. Vacek is the first philosopher to win the award. Most of the nominees for it, since its creation in 2019, have worked in the sciences.</p>
<p>The award includes a prize of 10,000 euros.</p>
