<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said he wants France to fast-track legislation that would ban children under 15 from using social media, aiming for it to take effect by September, when the next school year begins. He framed the move as a child-protection measure tied to concerns about heavy teen smartphone use and potential harms to young people’s development and well-being. The proposal would put France among the countries actively weighing stricter age limits for online platforms, as the UK government has also signaled it may consider similar restrictions for young teenagers.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/9dHeewdtXXJpW3N6RnD0ElKxz8otS1aBAhCPhtL-9rhcyTPwhWqeSfextr4V-RqLglqqZqTbHpPPuQxN9ITOg3rP1QRiPXy5-Y6cIGkP4u5IR341DfTxM97z1x4c741jMyb7ymCr9yCUwEwI4c0m1lQ8o49qLRWFtEe4ymljhQ' alt='French President Emmanuel Macron, as France debates under-15 social media rules.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Fast-track process: Macron said he asked the government to use an accelerated legislative procedure so the bill can move quickly and reach a Senate vote in time for September implementation.</li><li>Usage concerns: France’s health watchdog has cited high daily smartphone use among teenagers, with euronews reporting that about half spend two to five hours a day on their phones.</li><li>Policy rationale: Macron linked the initiative to worries about how social media may affect children, calling for stronger guardrails for minors online rather than leaving protection solely to families.</li><li>Europe context: The Hindu noted Macron’s push came days after the British government said it would consider banning young teenagers from social media, signaling a broader European debate over age thresholds.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Emmanuel Macron (French presidency): Macron says France should move quickly to restrict under-15 access to social media, aiming for a ban to start with the next school year.
