The offer is available to new or qualified returning &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; subscribers, but it is not an option for existing &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; subscribers. New subscribers can try &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; for three months, while returning subscribers get two months of access. <br/>
<br/>
There is no minimum denomination required for the gift card purchase, and the gift card can be acquired from the Apple retail store or Apple online store. Apple gift cards from third-party retailers or new value added to an Apple Account balance are not eligible for the &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; trial. Only one trial per Apple Account is available. <br/>
<br/>
Apple will provide the bonus code immediately after gift card redemption to an Apple Account balance. An Apple Account with a payment method on file is required, and the plan will automatically renew at &#36;6.99 per month unless it is canceled. <br/>
