</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A brief reflection on a #poetry #handbook that I just read.
</p>
        <p>I’ve been reading more poetry, and scratching out efforts at poetry.  <time datetime="2026-02-10" title="2026-02-10">Today</time> I
finished reading <cite data-id="a-poetry-handbook-by-mary-oliver">A Poetry Handbook</cite> by Mary Oliver.  A compact guide into the
writing and reading poetry; describing the basics, presenting a few examples,
and most importantly giving bits of advice.</p>
<ol>
<li>If one must choose between reading poetry and attending a workshop, choose
reading.  (Though consider a workshop)</li>
<li>A poem must be complete; that is it contains all that it must and is atomic,
though may reference/allude to other things.</li>
<li>The process of writing a poem is vulnerable to interruptions; flow state is a
good thing.</li>
<li>Revise and revisit.</li>
</ol>
<p>In reading, I haven’t gotten beyond subvocalization.  That is I say “in my mind”
the words I’m reading.  This, I think, helps in my read of poetry.  Because I
can almost imagine the breaths.  But subvocalizing poems, when I have the option
to read aloud, does a disservice.  I don’t feel the flip of my tongue, nor the
breath leaving.</p>
<p>Mary Oliver’s <cite data-id="a-poetry-handbook-by-mary-oliver">A Poetry Handbook</cite> provides this and more, delving into
philosophy.  I read the following and my mind cracked open:</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="literature-is-the-apparatus-through-which-the-world">
<p>
Literature is the apparatus through which the world tries to keep intact its
important ideas and feelings.
</p>
<footer>&#8213;Mary Oliver, <cite>A Poetry Handbook</cite></footer></blockquote>
<p>Yes, this definition of literature excludes the reality of oral tradition, which
I think is unfortunate.  But a quick substitution of “story” for “literature”
and we hit at the heart of things.  And by cracked open, I read that passage as
putting words to a known truth.</p>
<p>We write, narrate, and tell tales to convey that which we find important.  And
the act of re-telling and reading and listening is engaging in that
“preservation.”</p>
<p>Poetry is my present fascination, wrestling with the sound, shape, and shadow of
words.  The books that bind these poems I keep close, filling the cherry
bookshelf made by my father.  Throughout the days, I pull a book out, thumb to a
random page, and read a poem or three.  With 7 or so linear feet of poetry, I
find this to be a wonderful and sustaining grazing.</p>
