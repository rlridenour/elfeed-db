<p>An inquisitive ant sets out from point A at a bottom vertex of the 1 × 1 × 2 box shown above. Of all the possible destinations it might seek in a direct route along the surface of the box, which one requires the longest journey?</p>
<p>Intuitively we might think it&#8217;s point B, the farthest vertex on the box roof. But Japanese mathematician Yoshiyuki Kotani discovered that the longest journey actually ends one-fourth of the way along the rooftop diagonal that ends at point B.</p>
<p>This can be seen by &#8220;unfolding&#8221; the box into a flat diagram, where four different paths can be traced from A to that point. The Pythagorean theorem shows that all four paths have the same length, 2.850&#8230;, which is about 0.022 longer than the shortest path to B.</p>
