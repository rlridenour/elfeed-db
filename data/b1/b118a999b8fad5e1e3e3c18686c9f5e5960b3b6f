<p>Hong Kong’s High Court sentenced pro-democracy campaigner and former media tycoon Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison on Monday. The court convicted him in December on two counts of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and one count tied to publishing seditious materials linked to his Apple Daily newspaper and the 2019 unrest. Several other defendants linked to Apple Daily and the pro-democracy movement also received lengthy prison terms, with some reports noting sentences of more than 10 years for eight others. The sentence drew sharp criticism from some Western governments. Beijing and mainland-linked voices, meanwhile, framed the case as law enforcement under China’s national security framework and urged foreign governments not to weigh in. Lai’s family has appealed to President Donald Trump and other international leaders to press Beijing, as the case renews attention on legal rights, press freedom, and the longer-term direction of Hong Kong’s institutions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/1g9oYXzUR3wd_cfUr8aZKHPnxoVBt68YxNyOBVmRg-iKAhTSvZB5GXeshFLzn33SEi6R2OiVYV7yJWOlerVIu99YmjkEM9dZrc0n-j1dNKAwN82b8WMAMySCtxwpGNG0Mbzd3Z9DGZweSdUtmZPfI7hCKcNNUc2xzBvRwEaZBqHRc8XS4FnHWAZE9FwuyTGcTxGPxjoR59d8-RFOjw_wl5NctlnczZ4v2LeV8VWZGs_vHeACUQ' alt='Jimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 2020.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Harshest sentence: Multiple outlets described the punishment as the toughest or longest sentence yet under Hong Kong’s Beijing-imposed national security framework.</li><li>Court’s reasoning: Judges said Lai was “no doubt the mastermind of all three conspiracies charged,” and argued that this warranted a heavier sentence.</li><li>Health concerns: Lai’s family called the sentence “heartbreakingly cruel” given his declining health, and said they fear he could die in prison.</li><li>Foreign push: Lai’s children pointed to the prospect of a President Donald Trump visit to Beijing as a moment when other leaders could press China to free him.</li><li>Beijing’s message: Mainland Chinese authorities called the sentencing a “powerful declaration” that severe punishment awaits challenges to the law.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United Kingdom (Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper): Cooper said Lai had been jailed “for exercising his right to freedom of expression” and called for his release “on humanitarian grounds.” (<a href='https://theweek.com/crime/hong-kong-sentences-jimmy-lai-20-years'>The Week</a>)</li><li>China’s Foreign Ministry (Lin Jian): Lin said the case was “purely an internal affair” and urged other countries to “refrain from making irresponsible remarks.” (<a href='https://www.rt.com/news/632224-hong-kong-china-jimmy-lai/'>RT</a>)</li><li>Jimmy Lai’s family: His relatives have publicly appealed to President Donald Trump and other international leaders to pressure Beijing to free him.
