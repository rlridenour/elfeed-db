<p>&lsquo;Inspired by StreetLife’s research and findings, this collective of 12 local artists are mounting a celebratory closing exhibition for the Project. Their mixed media show is a creative response to Coney Street past, present and future and will include visual art, photography, 3D pieces, projections, music and poetry. The opening evening will feature a live performance by York architect, poet &amp; musician Thomas Pearson.
No booking is necessary. Please note that access to the exhibition space is by one set of stairs.&rsquo;</p>
