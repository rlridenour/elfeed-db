<p>I just did some quick-and-dirty benchmarking, using FSet's test suite.&nbsp; It was not designed as a benchmark, but I think it still gives a useful rough indication of how well FSet runs on different platforms.</p><p>These tests were all run on an Intel Xeon "Ivy Bridge" except the first one, which was on an Apple M2 MacBook Pro.&nbsp; Values are the time to run 100 iterations of the test suite; smaller is better.</p><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Inconsolata;">&nbsp; SBCL 2.5.3 on M2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.9</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Inconsolata;">&nbsp; SBCL 2.5.3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.8</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Inconsolata;">&nbsp; LispWorks 8.0.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5.8&nbsp; (Personal Edition, but I doubt that matters)</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Inconsolata;">&nbsp; CCL 1.13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13.3&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Inconsolata;">&nbsp; Franz Allegro 11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15.7</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Inconsolata;">&nbsp; ECL 24.5.10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;58.1</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Inconsolata;">&nbsp; CLASP 2.5.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;79.4</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Inconsolata;">&nbsp; ABCL 1.9.2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 85.3</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Inconsolata;">&nbsp;</span></div><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Yikes!&nbsp; Ignoring the M2 number, that's a factor of 30 &mdash; a very wide range.&nbsp; I don't think the test is entirely fair, because I develop on SBCL and haven't put any effort into optimizing for other platforms.&nbsp; I suspect the CCL and Allegro times could be improved somewhat.&nbsp; The poor performance of ECL and CLASP surprises me; FSet spends most of its time doing ordinary struct and simple-vector accesses, which I would think would translate well into C.&nbsp; Maybe they're still doing a lot of type- and bounds-checking, even though I've requested safety 0?</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">As for ABCL, I think it's a remarkable achievement that it is compatible enough to run FSet at all; I can't fault it for not being a speed demon.&nbsp; My guess is that the biggest gains to be had here would be from improving ABCL itself, rather than tweaking FSet.</span></p>
