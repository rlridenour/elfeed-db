<p>I didn’t want <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117267">this one</a> to pass unremarked upon, especially given that Stephen Hackett <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/536">recently discussed this issue on Connected</a>: Apple has finally unveiled a tool to merge Apple Accounts:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  You can choose to migrate apps, music, and other content you’ve purchased from Apple on a secondary Apple Account to a primary Apple Account. The secondary Apple Account might be an account that’s used only for purchases. You’ll need access to the primary email address or phone number and password for both accounts, and neither account should be shared with anyone else. Learn more about <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117294">how to migrate purchases</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a surprising number of people out there—Stephen Hackett and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/11/about-migrating-apple-account-purchases-between-accounts">John Gruber among them</a>—who ended up collecting a lot of iTunes and App Store purchases under one account, while separately using a different account for everything else.</p>
<p>In Stephen’s case, this led to a weird situation where he had issues purchasing extra storage for his iCloud family account. (His solution was to add his older account to his iCloud family.)</p>
<p>Presumably in order to protect from shenanigans, Apple says that the transferred-from accounts “can no longer be used for Media &amp; Purchases” after the transfer is complete.</p>
