<p>We&#8217;ve spent a lot of time tweaking this calendar over the years to get it just right. Here are some of the features I love:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It starts on Monday, as a proper calendar should.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s big at 25 inches by 36 inches. This isn&#8217;t one of those calendars you have to squint at. </li>



<li>The year-at-a-glance view is invaluable. Over the years, this calendar on my wall has gotten me out of a lot of pickles as I look at the calendar to see just how busy I am before I say yes to another commitment. There&#8217;s something about seeing three weeks of wall-to-wall appointments that makes saying no much easier.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s designed with no gaps between the months. The philosophy is simple: we think in weeks, not months. This calendar presents 52 weeks as a continuous flow, which makes it easy to see the distance between any two dates and plan across months without artificial boundaries.</li>



<li>You can write on it with dry-erase or wet-erase markers. I&#8217;ve tried both, and they both work great. The dry-erase is better if you&#8217;re constantly adjusting things, while wet-erase stays put better for long-term commitments.</li>



<li>It&#8217;s two calendars in one. Flip it over and you get a different orientation. One side is portrait, the other landscape. I keep mine in landscape above my desk, but you can hang it vertically on a door if that works better for your space.</li>



<li>The quarterly shading is genius. The calendar breaks the year into four quarters with background shading, making it easy to set quarterly goals and see reset points throughout the year. Buffer weeks are built in so you can review what worked, celebrate wins, and adjust course if needed.</li>



<li>The habit tracking system at the bottom lets you create your own color-coded system. Each day has space to track up to four habits, and it shows you how many days are left in the quarter to keep you honest.</li>
</ul>



<p>It&#8217;s beautiful. This matters more than you might think. When your productivity tool looks good, you actually want to use it. Attraction breeds commitment.</p>



<p>You can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.neuyear.net/products/focused?_pos=1&amp;_sid=4030c2fa0&amp;_ss=r">buy it now</a>. Mine is already on order.</p>
