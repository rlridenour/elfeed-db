<p>Watching videos on Youtube I&rsquo;ve noticed I influenced a lot by paying
attention to a video rating.
For example if rating is negative I initially treat a video as unprofessional or even stupid.</p>
<p>I tried to ignore a video rating but it&rsquo;s pretty hard so I decided to build a browser extension that should hide the rating.</p>
<p>So meet <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-hide-opinion/">Youtube hide Opinion</a>
the Firefox extension.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://codelearn.me/assets/img/hide-opinion1.png"><img alt="fun first" src="https://codelearn.me/assets/img/hide-opinion1.png" width="550px"/></a></p>
<p>As you can see you still can up/down vote a video but you don&rsquo;t see it&rsquo;s rating.</p>
<p>The extension also supports <strong>Enhancer for YouTube</strong>.</p>
<p>P.S.
Some time ago I also published this extension to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-hide-opinion/kmagnigdjocidngajmobbifcngjoejkm">Google&rsquo;s WebStore</a></p>
