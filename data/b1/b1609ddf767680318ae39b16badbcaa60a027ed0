<p>Two things I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t know earlier:</p>
<ol>
<li>strace&rsquo;s official logo is an <a href="https://strace.io/">adorable ostrich</a></li>
<li>If you pass <code>--tips</code> to strace, it&rsquo;ll give you an ASCII-art ostrich with a
speech bubble with an strace tip, like this: (via <a href="https://jade.fyi/">jade</a>)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  ______________________________________________         ____  
 | You can use -o|COMMAND to redirect strace's  |      |-. .-.|
 | output to COMMAND.  This may be useful       \      (_@)(_@)
 | in cases when there is a redirection          \     .---_  \
 | in place for the traced program.  Don't       _\   /..   \_/
 | forget to escape the pipe character, though, /     |__.-^ /
 | as it is usually interpreted by the shell.   |         }  |
