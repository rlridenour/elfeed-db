<p>The Pentagon announced on Friday that the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group will deploy to the Caribbean to bolster U.S. capacity to detect, monitor and disrupt illicit drug-related activity, a major escalation in Washington’s counter‑narcotics campaign . The deployment follows a rapid series of U.S. strikes against suspected drug‑smuggling boats that began in early September; media tallies say those operations have included ten strikes that resulted in dozens of deaths, including a recent attack that killed six people in international waters . The administration says the moves aim to degrade transnational criminal organizations; President Trump has also signaled he does not believe he needs congressional authorization for further action and warned that strikes on land could follow .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/-_SyGSWaeZXm2XZFnztX1ItvpsgFHNrZUhUQD2nI2FTPnftD2HoUJzEuJkHwX9A-Z16WoNubq37_tcGGQjJbclw5tTUQuzrNqT5papxi2twaWEW-rn8DdaJMhKfr1Jfcn66bLiR3Rg0KOMrjCwMd-jbUn_9HP9yMliSlQUA3D4jSBkTX6EgDOSfapUeE5yxNmrq2aPoKtIa83ZQED0eabvCQAuVaRIWkX2TU9K67Hu83VZ6XeKqD6PmjdKUxFUc-Xxr34xqleClR0-6J7Q' alt='FILE PHOTO: The USS Gerald R.
