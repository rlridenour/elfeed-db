Theena Kumaragurunathan, a filmmaker, photographer, and writer, has an <a href="https://itsfoss.com/emacs-the-ux-ideal/">interesting post on using Emacs for writing science fiction</a>. There&rsquo;s nothing new about that, if course. Several well known SF authors use Emacs. Kumaragurunathan&rsquo;s post is interesting for two reasons:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The story of his journey from using a word processor, to a customized Vim/NeoVim editing environment, and finally to a happy Emacs user.</li>
<li>His use of Emacs as a model for his &ldquo;Brain Computer Interface&rdquo;, a central part of his story.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The brain computer interface (BCI) is how the technical elite communicate with a sentient AI 500 years in the future. The BCI is more complicated and featureful than that described in Niven and Pournelle&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_Fealty_%28novel%29">Oath of Fealty</a>. Instead of dealing with buffers, it deals with thought patterns and, as with Emacs buffers, they can  be manipulated in various ways by a programming language built into the BCI.
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s an interesting concept but for those of us in 2026, the real value of Kumaragurunathan&rsquo;s post is his journey from word processors to Emacs. The journey is one of a quest to control his writing environment. Many Irreal readers will relate even if they have to substitute &ldquo;programming environment&rdquo; for &ldquo;writing environment&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Kumaragurunathan is promising a followup post in which he will discuss his Emacs workflow and how he uses it for writing fiction, research notes, film scripts, and even for programming. I&rsquo;m looking forward to it.</p>
