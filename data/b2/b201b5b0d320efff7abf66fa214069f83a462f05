I hardly ever write directly in HTML anymore. For a long time my only use was adding links and emphasis markup in WordPress comments but Disqus no longer accepts HTML so even that use has atrophied. Nevertheless, the need sometimes arises to insert a bit of raw HTML and that&rsquo;s where Charles Choi&rsquo;s latest Casual app, <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/announcing-casual-html-css.html">Casual HTML &amp; CSS</a> comes in.
</p>
<p>
The less you use HTML, the less likely you are to remember the details of its XML-like syntax, so a menu driven aid like Casual can be a real help. Choi&rsquo;s Casual HTML &amp; CSS leverages the builtin Emacs HTML and CSS modes so what you get is menu driven versions of HTML mode and CSS mode.

<p>
Because of the type of my work, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve even written a single character of CSS mode although I can read and understand it but I&rsquo;m sure there are lots of occasional CSS users who could benefit from Choi&rsquo;s app.

If you&rsquo;re a user of the Casual App Suite, you&rsquo;ll get Casual HTML &amp; CSS automatically on your next package update and you&rsquo;ll only need to enable it. There are a lot of useful apps in the suite so if you don&rsquo;t already have it installed, you might want to consider doing so.</p>
