The supply of water and sanitation in urban areas has historically been dominated by public investments. Aqueducts in ancient Rome and other major cities in the empire we funded by public money. Nineteenth-century London started water privatisation made a significant public investment in a sewer system to rid the city of the 200,000 cesspools that caused many diseases that plagued the city (Cadbury 2003).</p>
<p>
These developments eventually led to the establishment of fully vertically integrated government-owned monopolies in water and sanitation services. These monopolistic service providers have repeatedly been criticised for being inefficient and lacking <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/marketing/balanced-centricity/">customer focus</a> (Deichmann and Lall 2007). The past two decades, there has been a gradual transition of ownership of utility companies from public to private ownership. Private corporations are now actors in about half the countries of the world in some fundamental dimension of service delivery in the utility sector. This trend is increasing and is currently extending to the water and sanitation sectors (Estache et al. 2005).</p>
<p>
This paper discusses the rationale behind the recent wave of water privatisation in water and sanitation service provision. This is done with specific reference to service quality. The water and sanitation supply chain are examined to determine likely points of entry for competitive privatisation. It is proposed that the provision of retail services is an area in which market forces can be used to improve service to customers. A review of effects of privatisation on service quality is presented, based on extant literature on the topic and literature on service marketing theory.</p>
<p>
A conceptual model is presented to facilitate further research on the mechanisms that influence customer satisfaction due to ownership structure. It is argued that <em>managerial behaviour</em> is dependent upon ownership structure and a major determinant of the level of service quality.</p>

The Case for Water Privatisation
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>One of the often cited reasons that water distribution networks are in public control is because they are considered a natural monopoly (DiLorenzo 1996). A natural monopoly occurs when, &#34;due to the economies of scale of a particular industry, the maximum efficiency of production and distribution is realised through a single supplier&#34; (DiLorenzo 1996:
43).</p>
<p>
The high level of investment required to construct water distribution and sanitation networks creates a natural barrier to entry for more than one firm to operate in the same geographic area. Natural monopolies are considered unsuitable for a competitive market because of the duplication of facilities required to service individual customers in the same area (Hart et al. 1997). Natural monopolies exist in most markets for networked services, such as telecommunication, transport (particularly rail and harbours), electricity, gas and water supply (DiLorenzo 1996).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;The most important single central fact about a free market is that no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit.&#34;</p>
<p>
<a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/milton-friedman-corporate-social-responsibility/">Milton Friedman</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Natural monopolies in water and sanitation services are also widespread because of the so-called diamond-water paradox, expressed by Adam Smith as the <em>Paradox of Value</em> (Robertson and Taylor 1957). This is the assertion that some commodities without value in use, such as diamonds, have a high value in exchange and vice versa, water has a high use value, but demands a low price (Levy 1982). Although water is more critical to survival than diamonds, this is not reflected in pricing.</p>
<p>
Water is used for many purposes and in the case of reticulated water
supply, the same water is used for drinking, hygiene, gardens and as a
transport medium for waste. Economic theory suggests that the price of a
product is determined by its marginal utility, i.e. its least important
use to a person (Levy 1982). In the case of water, this is reflected in
the difference in price between tap water and bottled water. Consumers
in Australia are willing to pay more than 1000 times the price of tap
water for a bottle of drinking water, although the quality is
essentially the same.</p>
<p>
The low value of reticulated water implies that providing this type of
service generates very low margins for the investor. Significant amounts
of assets are required to deliver this service to a customer, but the
price that can be commanded is very little. This makes reticulated water
and sanitation supply particularly economically uninteresting for
private suppliers and is thus dominated by monopolistic publicly owned
service providers.</p>
<p>
Because of the natural monopoly characteristics of water and sanitation
services, privatisation has seen some monopolistic segments in the
industry transferred to private operators (Estache et al. 2005). One
means by which governments attempt to negate the disadvantages of
monopolised state-owned service providers is through regulation.
Regulation usually takes the form of market mimicking regimes in which
service providers compete with each other through performance
benchmarking. In this system, utilities are &#34;forced to compete with a
shadow-firm whose performance is determined by average or best practice
in the industry&#34; (Braadbaart 2007: 680).</p>
<p>
Research in the Netherlands shows that this type of benchmarking
enhances economic performance. There is a clear case for yardstick
competition (Estache et al. 2005; Tupper and Resende 2004). Yardstick
competition is, however, not a sine qua non for performance enhancement.
Also, collaborative rather than competitive, benchmarking has a positive
effect on utility performance (Braadbaart 2007). Regulation is
appropriate if firms have incentives to reduce costs and minimise the
level of service provision. The incentive to reduce cost is considered a
potential negative consequence of privatisation (Fumagalli et al. 2007).
Partly privatised utilities subject to service quality regulation
maintain incentives towards high levels of quality (Fumagalli et al.
2007).</p>

Status of Water privatisation in the World
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Most water and sanitation service are currently provided by publicly
owned organisations (Deichmann and Lall 2007; Estache et al. 2005).
However, in several countries around the world different modes and
levels of privatisation of water and sanitation services have been
implemented. The privatisation of state-owned utility service providers
has been most prominent in developing countries because the opportunity
cost of maintaining government-owned enterprises over private ownership
is higher than in developed countries (Deichmann and Lall 2007).</p>

<p>
The privatisation of state-owned utility providers is partially driven
by the World Bank. The privatisation conditions of reforms funded by the
World Bank is the privatisation of formerly state-owned enterprises
(Tsamenyi et al. 2008). Water privatisation is, however, a broad
sweeping term that can encompass a range of different models in
different parts of the supply chain, which is discussed in more detail
below. Broadly speaking, privatisation is part of the supply chain of
water and sanitation supply in around 35% of the countries of the
developed world and 80% of the countries in the developing world.</p>
<p>
Estimates show that nearly half of the urban population in African
nations rely on private providers for water service (Auriol and Picard
2008). Research on the efficiency of private operators in this continent
shows that they are more cost-efficient and that corruption reduces
efficiency and matters more than ownership. However, no significant
difference between public and private operators is found once
environmental factors have been accounted for (Estache et al. 2005).</p>
<p>
In 1989, Argentina initiated a process of privatising infrastructure
services, including water and sanitation (Chisari et al. 1999). Services
were privatised because of a need to alleviate the financial burden
imposed by public utilities. Before services were privatised, the
existing organisations were vertically disintegrated. In the water
sector, competition has been introduced through a bidding process.
Between 1993 and 1994, privatisation of water distribution resulted in a
4.9% reduction in inputs purchased as a share of total sales. The size
of the population served per staff member decreased by 27.6%, i.e. the
total number of employees increased.</p>
<p>
Water efficiency, measured as distribution losses, improved over this
period. Lastly, the cost of water to consumers grew by 5.5 %. Overall,
privatisation of utilities in Argentina has increased labour
productivity, but higher cost for customers, while lowering cost for the
utility providers (Chisari et al. 1999). In Brazil, it was found that
there is no significant difference between public and private operators
regarding their productivity (Estache et al. 2005).</p>
<p>
In 1989, the government sold ten publicly owned water/sanitation
companies in England and Wales and established a new, independent sector
regulator (van den Berg 1997). The regulator controls both water and
sanitation utilities with the aim to protect customers&#39; interests
(Seppälä et al. 2004).</p>
<p>
Water and sanitation service provision in the Australian state of
Victoria is fully in public hands, with many activities outsourced to
private partners. All state-owned service providers are regulated by the
Essential Services Commission. The Victorian government is currently
investigating means to increase private participation in the provision
of water and sanitation services through so-called Third Party Access
(Essential Services Commission 2009).</p>

General Arguments for Water Privatisation
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The public ownership model has been criticised because of a perception
that services provided by these institutions are often inadequate and
few utilities are able to recover the full cost as pricing is often
politically motivated (Deichmann and Lall 2007). The general argument
against public ownership of utility service providers is that public
services lack Adam Smith&#39;s &#39;invisible hand&#39; to guide resource allocation
based on consumer preferences (Andreassen 1994). The regulator for water
and sewerage services in Victoria, Australia has expressed the
anticipated advantages of privatisation succinctly (Essential Services
Commission 2009: 9, emphasis added):</p>
<ul>
<li>More efficient allocation of resources (allocative efficiency);</li>
<li>Efficiency and productivity improvements, leading to lower costs of
providing products and/or services from existing input sources,
processes and technologies (productive efficiency);</li>
<li>Longer term efficiency and productivity improvements, with lower costs
and improved service quality arising from new and improved input
sources, processes and technologies (dynamic efficiency) and;</li>
<li>Greater customer choice, with innovative offerings of products and/or
services that better reflect customer needs and preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>DiLorenzo (1996) argues that the often proclaimed natural monopolies in
utility services are an economic fiction and their development was an
ex-post rationale for government intervention. There is, according to
DiLorenzo (1996), no evidence that a natural monopoly, i.e. one firm
achieving lower long-run average total cost than other companies, in the
industry thereby establishing a permanent monopoly, ever existed. The
existence of economies of scale in water and other public utilities does
not necessitate a monopoly because competitive and market forces will
naturally regulate an industry (DiLorenzo 1996).</p>
<p>
Hart et al. (1997) point out that private suppliers deliver public
services at a lower cost than public providers. Public ownership of
utilities is generally viewed as generating inefficiencies because of
soft budget constraints as governments will subsidise money-losing
ventures. Empirical data from the United States shows that publicly
owned water utilities had higher costs than their privately owned
counterparts (Estache and Rossi 2002). The transfer from public to
private ownership is thus often advocated as a solution for the poor
economic performance of utility companies (Auriol and Picard 2008). The
economic arguments over efficiency in relation to ownership are,
however, not conclusive as some research indicates that there are no
statistically significant differences in efficiency between water
corporations, regardless of their ownership structure (Bakker 2007;
Estache and Rossi 2002).</p>
<p>
Economic theory suggests that a privately owned monopolist will
over-invest in cost reduction if the quality of their service is not
regulated (Hart et al. 1997). This decrease in investment can have
negative consequences on service quality as investment and service
quality are closely related to the provision of utilities. Although it
can be shown that both private and public monopolists are equally likely
to under-invest in quality enhancements, publicly owned utility
providers will deliver a higher quality because there is no managerial
incentive to reduce cost (Fumagalli et al. 2007; Hart et al. 1997).</p>
<p>
The case for government-owned service provision is generally stronger
when cost reductions are likely to reduce service quality, when quality
innovations are unimportant, and when corruption in government
procurement is a severe problem (Hart et al. 1997). In contrast, the
case for water privatisation is stronger when quality reducing cost
reductions can be controlled through regulation or by competition (Hart
et al. 1997).</p>
<p>
Initiatives to privatise state-owned enterprises are often based on the
assumption that in private industry, managers have greater freedom to
set a corporate strategy and raise capital as is the case in publicly
owned organisations (Andreassen 1994; Fumagalli et al. 2007). Water
corporations require incentives to act in the public interest and to
ensure that managerial behaviour is disciplined. These incentives can be
provided through the introduction of competition (Andreassen 1994;
Deichmann and Lall 2007; Fumagalli et al. 2007).</p>
<p>
Services delivered by publicly owned institutions are often considered
inadequate, few utilities are able to recover full cost and pricing is
politically motivated (Deichmann and Lall 2007). One of the main issues
identified by proponents of increased private business involvement in
the provision of utilities is that publicly owned services are not
subject to market forces (Fumagalli et al. 2007). Porter (1990) claims
on a macroeconomic level that corporate strategy, industry structure and
rivalry and demanding customers will stimulate service providers to
focus on the market.</p>
<p>
To offer a high level of utility, the public sector must be more
marketed oriented, i.e. supply more differentiated services (Andreassen
1994). Privatised energy companies are improving their market position
by being more customer oriented and focusing on
<a href="https://lucidmanager.org/marketing/water-utility-branding/">branding</a> in response to increased competition (Hartmann and Ibáñez 2007). The
principal objective of a Marketing Orientation is to provide a long-term
profit focus through three behavioural components (Narver and Slater
1990):</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer orientation: Understanding customer&#39;s needs to be able to
create superior value;</li>
<li>Competitor orientation: Understanding the short and long-term
strengths and weaknesses of competitors; and</li>
<li>Interfunctional coordination: Leveraging collective resources to
create value.</li>
</ul>
<p>There has been strong opposition to the introduction of market forces in
water supply. The main argument being that water should be considered a
human right and not as a tradeable commodity. Water is regarded as a
human right as it is not substitutable and intrinsically linked with
other human rights, such as the right to life (Bakker 2007). These
arguments do, however, not preclude commercialisation of water supply
services because many other human rights are underpinned also by private
business involvement, e.g. the right to life and the food industry.
Another line of thought used to argue against commercial influences in
the supply of water is environmentally grounded.</p>
<p>
Private companies are answerable to shareholders that seek profit
maximisation and will thus not be able to provide long-term sustainable
water supply solutions (Bakker 2007). However, market forces in water
services use the scarcity of water as a starting point and enforce that
it must be priced at the full economic and environmental cost, rather
than political pricing adopted in many jurisdictions. Using market
pricing will ensure that water is allocated to its highest value use
(Bakker 2007).</p>

<h3 id="headline-4">
Types of Water Privatisation
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>There are many levels at which participation of privately owned industry
can be achieved. Bakker (2007) identified three categories of resource
management reform and seven possible means to achieve this. Property
rights can be privatised in the form of riparian rights or the sale of
water supply infrastructure to the private sector. Deregulation can
occur where, for example, the state ceases direct control over water
quality mechanisms (Bakker 2007). Organisational types of reform
opportunities exist in using private sector partnerships, where
governments purchase a service instead of an asset (Auriol and Picard
2008).</p>
<p>
The corporatisation of organisational structures is the conversion of
the business model from a local government to a publicly owned
corporation. The governance of resources can be reformed by
marketisation through the introduction of a water market and
commercialisation through the introduction of commercial principles in
water management. Lastly, (Bakker 2007) proposes decentralisation and
the subsequent introduction of community managed utility services as a
reform option. All these types of water privatisation can occur at
multiple places in the supply chain of water and sanitation services.</p>

<h2 id="headline-5">
The Water and Sanitation Service Supply Value Chain
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The supply of water and sanitation services has a circular supply chain
that is deeply connected with the natural environment (Figure 3.1).
Water is mostly sourced from rivers, groundwater, or more increasingly,
seawater. The so-called &#39;raw water&#39; can be distributed directly to
customers or treated to a higher level of quality, depending on customer
preferences. The sanitation supply chain starts with the collection and
transportation of wastewater from customers.</p>
<p>
The wastewater is treated to a suitable standard and either
reincorporated in the natural water cycle or sold to other customers
(Figure 3.1). All these activities typically occur within a single
organisation with the supply chain only being interrupted by the brief
time that the water is being used at the customer&#39;s property. The water
and sanitation industry particularly, where government-owned, is an
example of complete vertical integration. In most cases, water is
harvested or created, stored, treated, transported and retailed without
the intervention or involvement of external parties.</p>
<p>
The supply chain for water and sanitation has some characteristics in
common with that of agricultural commodities. Both water and
agricultural commodities are harvested at particular times throughout
the year that does not necessarily match up with the demands patterns of
customers. The weather also plays a critical role in determining the
total yield of the harvest. The product must be stored so that demand
and supply can be matched. In agriculture, the commodity is stored in
silos, and in the water industry, it is stored in tanks, dams, the
reticulation network and aquifers.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
Water and sanitation supply chain.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
There is a significant difference between agriculture and water supply
chains in the mechanism used to meet consumer demand from the point of
storage. Agricultural commodities are shifted in discrete units or
bundles via road, rail and marine transport. Water is most commonly
supplied continuously to the customer via pipework directly into the
customer&#39;s house. The service is provided on demand, with no need for
order placing or direct intervention from the service provider. The
supply chain for water services is entirely dissimilar to other
networked utilities, such as electricity or telecommunications in which
supply must always equal demand due to: the inability to store
electricity in any economically efficient way; and telecommunications
being a service in which supply and consumption are concurrent. The
logistical problem of water and sanitation supply is to design a
distribution network that is able to manage the diurnal demands of
customers (Smith 1999).</p>
<p>
The physical provision of water and removal of wastewater are the
tangible aspects of the service product concept. Supporting, or
auxiliary services, as defined by Grönroos (1990), are those which
supplement and add value to the core service in order to differentiate
one service provider from another. An example of a supporting service
that could be provided by a water and sanitation provider s advice on
the efficient use of water. Facilitation services are those that assist
with the delivery and consumption of the core service (Grönroos 1990).
Examples of these are information provision, order taking, billing and
payment. All these activities occur in the retail interface between the
distribution and consumption of the services (Figure 3).</p>
<p>
Vertically integrated monopolistic organisations have little need for
supporting services because there is no possibility to differentiate,
facilitation services are, however, indispensable. Supporting services
can be eliminated and mainly serve a marketing purpose (Grönroos 1990).
Due to the natural monopoly nature of water and sanitation distribution
networks, service providers are not able to differentiate on quality as
the same water or sewage flows through the same pipes. In a privatised
and marketised retail situation, providers can only compete in
supporting and facilitation services.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Privatisation of the Water and Sanitation Supply Chain
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Not all aspects of the water and sanitation supply chain display natural
monopoly characteristics and certain parts are thus suitable for
introducing privately owned service providers. Natural monopolies can be
assumed to exist in water storage (large dams), bulk water delivery and
distribution and the transport of wastewater. This leaves water
sourcing, treatment and water retailing as potentially competitive
aspects of the water supply chain. In sanitation services, the
collection and treatment of wastewater can be considered suitable for a
competitive environment (Essential Services Commission 2009). The
privatisation of individual aspects of the supply chain and the
breakdown of vertical integration will increase the number of marketing
channels in the chain (Kotler et al. 2007). The water and sanitation
marketing channel can be separated into four channels, i.e. sourcing,
treatment, distribution and retailing (Essential Services Commission
2009).</p>
<p>
As indicated by Estache et al. (2005), privatisation of aspects of the
supply chain has been implemented in a majority of the countries around
the world. This privatisation is, however, mostly limited to private
sector partnerships, whilst maintaining government control over the full
supply chain. Some aspects of the supply chain that are generally
undertaken by private partners of public organisations are the
construction of water and sewage reticulation, the operation and
maintenance of that infrastructure and in some cases ownership of water
and wastewater treatment facilities.</p>
<p>
As most water and sanitation supply organisations are currently in
vertically integrated public institutions, the entire supply chain is
within the control of one group, simplifying the marketing channel for
all involved. Vertical integration provides an environment in which the
transmission of information, money and the water itself is less
complicated than in a non vertically integrated supply chain. However,
the simplicity of this supply chain becomes more complex as a
competitive model is employed. As each marketing channel consists of
dissimilar organisations that cooperate for their common benefit, the
behaviour of each of the channel participants is not always aligned with
the common goal, leading to channel conflict (Kotler et al. 2007).
Introduction of competition in the retail interface for water and
sanitation can lead to both horizontal conflicts between competitors and
vertical conflict between channel participants.</p>
<p>
The consequences of not effectively managing the supply chain may be
significant for retailers. The Bullwhip Effect phenomenon demonstrates
that there can be significant and exaggerated fluctuations in supply in
response to demand and the information provided to suppliers (Lee et al.
1997). The consequences of these include supply gluts, insufficient
storage and, at times, insufficient supply to meet demand. Challenges in
matching supply and demand are often related to imperfections in
information transmitted from one organisation to another. By having the
retail and supply functions within the same organisation, the speed at
which this information may be transmitted, interpreted, discussed and
improved upon is faster and more effective providing an advantage to the
Government-owned retailer.</p>
<p>
The impact of this is that the private sector is likely to claim that a
level playing field does not exist and the likely result of this is the
introduction of probity arrangements to ensure that the information
provided to all retailers is substantially similar. Thus, the
consequence of introducing partial privatisation of the water and
sanitation supply chain is an increased complexity that could lead to
negative impacts for customers, unless the supply channel is aligned
through information sharing (Lee et al. 1997).</p>

<h2 id="headline-7">
Service Quality under Privatisation of Retail Services in Water and Sanitation
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Research on the effect of privatisation of water and sanitation
utilities mostly focuses on econometric modelling of macroeconomic
benefits (Estache et al. 2005; Fumagalli et al. 2007; Picazo-Tadeo et
al. 2008) and much less attention has been given to the effects on the
levels of customers service (Tsamenyi et al. 2008). Although little
research has been undertaken on the relationship between ownership and
service quality in water and sanitation services, all networked utility
services, such as electricity, gas, telecommunication, water and
sanitation can be considered analogous. Firstly, networked utility
services are considered a natural monopoly (DiLorenzo 1996) and have
traditionally been undertaken by government-owned organisations
(Deichmann and Lall 2007). There are also similarities in customer
satisfaction determinants between these services, specifically in
relation to continuity and quality of supply (Fumagalli et al. 2007;
Hartmann and Ibáñez 2007; Seppälä et al. 2004).</p>
<p>
Because of the similarities between networked utility services and the
paucity of research in the field of marketing water and sanitation
services, this review focuses on research undertaken in different areas
of utility provision, mainly electricity retailing. The model used in
this paper is static in that it does not address the transition from
public to private ownership, but compares the pre- and
post-privatisation situation.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-8">
Customer Satisfaction
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The definition of customer satisfaction is a consumer&#39;s post-purchase
evaluation of the overall service experience and is an affective
reaction. Customer satisfaction is pivotal to create a sustainable
competitive advantage, specifically in relation to customer loyalty
(Lovelock et al. 2007). Two approaches to measuring service quality most
commonly used are ex-post Customer Satisfaction Surveys or ex-ante
evaluations of customer preferences (Ferrari and Salini 2008).
Satisfaction with utility services is largely determined by actual
service levels but is also influenced by personal characteristics and by
the evaluation of services relative to that of the customer&#39;s peers
(Deichmann and Lall 2007).</p>
<p>
An often cited tool for assessing customer perceptions of service
quality is SERVQUAL (Parasuraman et al. 1988). This instrument provides
five crucial dimensions of service quality: Reliability, Assurance, Tangibles, Empathy and
Responsiveness. The main benefit of SERVQUAL is its ability to examine
different service industries such as healthcare, banking, financial
services, and education (Nyeck et al. 2007) The SERVQUAL model has also
been used in water and sanitation industry (Alegre et al. 2000; Seppälä
et al. 2004).</p>
<p>
The provision of services is usually dominated by intangibles, i.e. the
service itself is not a physical object. The intangibility of services
makes them difficult to visualise and evaluate, which highlights the
importance of tangibles in the marketing of services (Lovelock et al.
2007). Tangible aspects of water and sanitation provisions are first and
foremost any colour or odour issues related to the provided water or the
effectiveness of the sanitation. Other tangible elements of water and
sanitation service provision are, for example, the image of employees,
publication materials, local offices and so on (Parasuraman et al.
1988).</p>
<p>
The water and sanitation service provision is, however, dominated by intangible elements as the service is provided with very little interaction between the customer and the service provider. The provision of utility services, such as water and sanitation, can thus be classified as an intangible, <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/marketing/tap-water-paradoxes/">low-involvement service</a> (Lovelock 1983). Customers will, therefore, place a lower value on the tangible aspects of the end product and more value in the process of service delivery. As long as the service delivery is consistent and reliable, customers may be willing to pay a higher price (Walsch et al. 2005).</p>
<p>
Reliability is the ability of a service provider to perform the promised
service dependably and accurately (Parasuraman et al. 1988). The
importance of reliability is highlighted by the fact that any major
breakdown in utility provision usually becomes national news. Research
by Deichmann and Lall (2007) undertaken in Bangalore, India, shows that
household satisfaction with a utility&#39;s performance is directly related
to the number of hours per day water is available.</p>
<p>
The remaining three parameters in the SERVQUAL model are directly
related to the behaviour of staff. Responsiveness encompasses the
willingness of staff to help customers and provide prompt service.
Assurance is the ability of employees to inspire trust and confidence
and empathy relates to the caring and individualised attention a firm
provides to customers (Parasuraman et al. 1988).</p>
<p>
The core water and sanitation services are delivered at arm&#39;s length as
they are provided directly on the customer&#39;s premises. Supporting and
facilitating services, however, rely mostly on direct interaction
between staff of the organisation and the customer.</p>
<p>
In subsequent work, Zeithaml et al. (1993), developed a model (Figure
4.1) to assess the nature and determinants of customer expectations of
service. The conceptual model specifies three different types of service
expectations: desired service, adequate service and predicted service.
Based on this model, five potential gaps in service provision have been
identified, of which three are discussed below.</p>

ServQual Gap Model.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
<strong>Gap 1</strong> - Customer expectations and management&#39;s perception of these.</p>
<p>
The difference between the customer&#39;s expectation of service and
management&#39;s perception of these expectations is the first gap defined
by Zeithaml et al. (1993). In a publicly owned corporation, management&#39;s
perception of customer expectations are mostly not market driven, but
politically motivated, as will be discussed below.</p>
<p>
<strong>Gap 2</strong> - Establish the right service quality standards.</p>
<p>
The actual service quality standards are the second possible source of
service gaps. Public utilities are homogeneous and do not reflect
different the demand characteristics of customers (Andreassen 1994;
Seppälä et al. 2004). Andreassen (1994) discussed factors that affect
business customer satisfaction in privatised state-owned enterprises and
found that heterogeneity among the users of public services is reflected
in different demand characteristics and that consequently, various
segments of users have significantly varying levels of satisfaction. The
defining distinction between publicly and privately owned water and
sanitation service providers is that the latter is driven by market
forces and will thus be more sensitive to segmentation of their customer
service offering.</p>
<p>
<strong>Gap 3</strong> - Meeting service provision standards.</p>
<p>
As far as meeting the actual service standards, research generally
indicates that there is no distinguishing difference between privately
and publicly owned service providers (Fumagalli et al. 2007; Estache et
al. 2005). The extant research on this topic is, however, focused on
meeting the primary service standards, such as continuity and quality of
supply, ignoring the supplementary services (Picazo-Tadeo et al. 2008;
Tsamenyi et al. 2008).</p>

Customer Behaviour
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<p>An interesting aspect of utility services provision is that consumer
behaviour can affect the quality of service delivery (Fumagalli et al.
2007). In water and sanitation, this is illustrated by the imposition of
usage limitations in the form of water restrictions in
many Australian states. Loyalty is a critical aspect of customer
behaviour and a key parameter in creating a financially profitable
relationship over time (Lovelock et al. 2007) and is generally
considered a more effective business strategy than attempting to acquire
new customers as the latter is much more expensive (Hartmann and Ibáñez
2007).</p>
<p>
Due to the ubiquity of government-owned monopolies in the provision of
water and sanitation services, customer loyalty has not played a role of
importance in managerial considerations. The natural monopolistic nature
of utility services provides a large barrier to access for a competitive
market to emerge and changing providers is thus not a viable option for
the customer (Deichmann and Lall 2007). However, experience in areas
where service provision is open to competition shows that after
privatisation and the introduction of a competitive market, most
consumers will not be very willing to change (Hartmann and Ibáñez 2007).
In Germany, electricity consumers have been reluctant to exercise choice
and few private electricity customers have switched energy suppliers
(Walsch et al. 2005).</p>
<p>
According to Hart et al. (1997), a market open to consumer choice in
which the customer can assess the service quality, a privatised provider
is rewarded for quality-enhancing efforts through repeat purchase by
customers. The relationship is, however, more complicated. Several
approaches to customer loyalty have been proposed in the literature. Gee
et al. (2008) introduce the concept of polygamous customers that are
loyal to several brands. In the provision of most utility services,
polygamous purchasing behaviour cannot occur because of infrastructure
constraints and the natural monopoly, i.e. each house can only have one
water and sanitation connection. Brand switching can, however, arise in
a situation where the retail function has been privatised, as is
commonly the case in telecommunications and the energy market.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://lucidmanager.org/images/water-marketing/satisfaction-loyalty.jpg" alt="Effect of competition on the Satisfaction-Loyalty relationship" title="Effect of competition on the Satisfaction-Loyalty relationship"/>
<figcaption>
Effect of competition on the Satisfaction-Loyalty relationship (Jones and Sasser 1995: 91).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Jones and Sasser (1995) provide a model to predict the switching
behaviour of customers in a privatised water and sanitation retail
market. Common sense would dictate that the relationship between
satisfaction and loyalty is linear; the more satisfied a customer is,
the more likely they will remain loyal. The relationship is, however,
dependent upon the level of competition in the market. For water and
sanitation services in a situation of natural monopoly, either
privatised or in public hands, the relationship between customer loyalty
and satisfaction (Figure 4, top curve) is not relevant as the only
choice customers have is either to purchase or not purchase the service.
The more competitive a market becomes, the more sensitive customers will
be to switching and managing customer satisfaction will not be
sufficient to ensure customer loyalty.</p>
<p>
Walsch et al. (2005) confirmed the findings of Jones and Sasser (1995)
and found that customer satisfaction by itself did not have a
significant effect on switching intentions of customers from German
energy suppliers. The intangibility and heterogeneity of utility
services make the interpretation of brands as promised to the customer
of particular importance (Hartmann and Ibáñez 2007). The loyalty of
residential customers in the energy market depends as much on brand
image as on switching cost and satisfaction (Andreassen 1994; Hartmann
and Ibáñez 2007). The research by Walsch et al. (2005) indicated that
monetary and non-monetary switching cost, risk aversion and lack of
transparency in the market are major determinants of the high levels of
customer loyalty they found. The market for services can be segmented
into &#39;loyals&#39;, &#39;habituals&#39;, &#39;switchers&#39; and &#39;multi branders&#39;, expressed
in the Diamond of Loyalty (Lovelock et al. 2007):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Loyals</em> have the highest profit potential and have an active
preference for the brand with a strong emotional connection. They also
see a high perceived risk in switching brands.</li>
<li><em>Habituals</em> are passive loyals through inertia. They are
behaviourally, but not attitudinal loyal and are passive brand
advocates. They are susceptible to switching when there is a service
failure or through competitor&#39;s promotional deals. Their retention is
mostly based on convenience and switching costs.</li>
<li><em>Multi branders</em> have a small repertoire of service brands and
actively search based on quality and price. They have little
involvement in the brand and often seek variety for its sake.</li>
<li><em>Switchers</em> are characterised by a broad portfolio of brands and are
sensitive to price promotions and have a low perceived risk of
switching.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, service marketing theory (Jones and Sasser 1995; Lovelock et
al. 2007) and research in the retail of utilities (Hartmann and Ibáñez
2007; Walker and Johnson 2005) show that a correlation exists between
customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. There is, however, no direct
causality between satisfaction and loyalty as other confounding
variables, such as customer psychology and brand image, are at play.</p>
<p>
Given the experience in some privatised utility markets (Hartmann and
Ibáñez 2007; Walker and Johnson 2005), most customers could possibly be
classified as either Loyals or Habituals. The implications for managers
is that managing customer satisfaction will not be sufficient to
stimulate loyalty, as shown by Jones and Sasser (1995). The central
question to be asked is whether the existence of loyalty segmentation as
confirmed by Walsch et al. (2005) for electricity retail in Germany, as
exists in water and sanitation retailing.</p>

Managerial behaviour
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-3">
<p>One aspect of the relationship between ownership structure and service
quality in utility provision that has not been given much attention in
the literature is the impact of managerial behaviour on customer service
levels (Fumagalli et al. 2007). Managerial behaviour impacts on service
quality through job design, staff empowerment and development (Lovelock
et al. 2007).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although voter satisfaction is related to customer satisfaction, it is a poor proxy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A significant difference between a privately or publicly owned service
provider is the intention of the owners. In publicly owned
organisations, managers are separated from the owners, while in
privately owned organisations, the owners play a direct role in the
management of the firm through directors. The core purpose of a
privately owned corporation is to maximise the return for its
stakeholders while for publicly owned organisations the objectives are
often political (Du Plessis et al. 2005). Seppälä et al. (2004),
however, states that regardless of their ownership structure, all water
and sanitation service providers share a common purpose and management
objectives (Seppälä et al. 2004), which was defined by Alegre et al.
(2000) as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;The achievement of the highest level of consumer satisfaction and service quality in line with the prevailing regulatory framework, whilst making best use of available resources&#34;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Although it can be considered a truism that customer satisfaction is the
primary aim of both public and private organisations, the managerial
behaviour will be very different. A profit-maximising privately owned
firm will improve quality to the point where the marginal benefit to the
consumers of additional quality equals the marginal cost to the business
of increasing quality. For a politically oriented publicly owned firm,
quality improvements are often more related to the political will of the
responsible governments than to customer perception (Fumagalli et al.
2007). Although voter satisfaction is related to customer satisfaction,
it is a poor proxy.</p>
<p>
Managers of a publicly owned utility service provider are separated from
the owners and have &#39;private costs&#39; of decisions that negatively impact
on service quality, while in privately owned corporations, managers
negate private benefits, usually in the form of reduced income
(Fumagalli et al. 2007).<br>
In private industry, managers have greater freedom to set a corporate
strategy and raise capital as is the case in publicly owned
organisations (Andreassen 1994; Fumagalli et al. 2007). Managers in
privately owned corporations are disciplined, i.e. act in the best
interest of the company, through the existence of competitors
(Andreassen 1994; Deichmann and Lall 2007; Fumagalli et al. 2007). This
principle assumes that effective corporate governance is in place to
negate the Agency Problem, i.e. the problem of managers adopting
discretionary behaviours other than investments (Du Plessis et al. 2005;
Fumagalli et al. 2007).</p>
<p>
Fumagalli et al. (2007) analysed the relationship between privatisation
and service quality in the electricity industry and explored the
autonomous role of managerial behaviour. They found that a reduction in
management dominance through the larger presence of external directors
resulted in better supply quality.</p>
<p>
Improvements in performance due to privatisation or regulation can be
explained by the introduction of new management styles and techniques,
leading to increased organisational efficiency and design. Top
management signals are one of the most influential forces driving a
market organisation (Andreassen 1994).</p>

Synthesis
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The past decades, water and sanitation service providers have been
privatised in several jurisdictions around the world. The motivation for
this wave of reform is predominantly based on econometric
considerations. Evidence on the effectiveness of privatisation is mixed
but point towards there being no significant economic difference. The
research on this topic has been widely myopic of the marketing
implications of privatisation. Also, the environmental complexity and
the myriad of confounding variables, in particular, differences in
legislation around the globe, frustrate the possibility of drawing firm
conclusions.</p>

Relational model between ownership structure, customer satisfaction and behaviour.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
A review of the extant literature on the privatisation of utility
services and services marketing theory shows managerial behaviour as a
possible independent variable influencing customer satisfaction as
described in the relational model in figure 5.1.</p>
<p>
The transition from publicly- to a privately-owned provision of water
and sanitation services has been driven by a quest for improved
efficiency, demonstrated by the recent wave of water privatisation of
most networked utility services. In many countries around the world,
there is already significant private investment in the provision of
water and sanitation services, but the impact of privatisation on the
level of customer service has been widely ignored.</p>
<p>
It is argued that a change of ownership structure in the provision of
retailing services significantly improves the behaviour of managers that
are responsible for the interfunctional coordination of the service
organisation. As described in the conceptual model, this has a direct
impact on all at least three dimensions of the SERVQUAL service
provision model: Responsiveness, Assurance and Empathy. The consequent
change in service quality acts to influence customer satisfaction and in
turn altering customers&#39; loyalty behaviours.</p>
<p>
The proposed model, though based on germane secondary research, has been
developed under the assumption that networked services such as
telecommunications, transport and energy are analogous to water and
sanitation services. It is proposed that future research is undertaken
to focus on testing this model, specifically within water and sanitation
service provision. Given the upcoming changes to the contestable
provision of services in the Victorian water and sanitation sector
recommended by the Essential Services Commission, the ideal industry
environment exists to test the model. In doing so, this model may
provide insights into how the industry may transition to a free-market
model in which each of the parties involved in the transaction described
by Milton Friedman in the epigraph will receive maximum benefit.</p>
