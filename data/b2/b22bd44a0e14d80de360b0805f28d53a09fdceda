<p>A South Korean court on Wednesday sentenced former prime minister Han Duck-soo to 23 years in prison over his role in the brief martial-law attempt under then-president Yoon Suk Yeol. Judges found Han helped give procedural cover to the decree by convening a cabinet meeting, with the court describing the episode as an insurrection/rebellion. The ruling is the first criminal verdict directly tied to the 2024 crisis, and many observers see it as a sign that South Korea’s institutions are continuing to work through the episode via courts and parliament rather than force.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/aikzZpQzygEBgqvc-waIji8Sd37nYo8H6OJ6_89KSlCo_2JMfBnG3208KnWzztdPNCP7QWfgOifq2Ts3R1DgjvmStD8lNBp2IgQBqgtuinFa3ZcAbDYoe1m_D3tQsNPost0WLhREZ5JI4l8hi4zauKH2ZEpwsrW5qzZd39RdDYEa7fGCbut9o5ux-dAW4Bk_FTM' alt='Han Duck-soo, South Korea’s former prime minister, arriving at Seoul Central District Court on Wednesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Why sentence rose: The 23-year term exceeded prosecutors’ requested 15 years, with the judge saying Han failed his duty to uphold constitutional order.</li><li>Specific allegations: The court said Han appeared to encourage then-interior minister Lee Sang-min in a plan that included cutting power and water to certain news outlets, and it also convicted Han of perjury.</li><li>How it ended: Parliament overturned the martial-law declaration within hours after lawmakers convened despite an attempted security blockade, while troops did not enforce the order as protesters gathered outside.</li><li>Case bellwether: Legal experts described Han as the first former cabinet minister to receive a ruling tied to the martial-law episode, making the case a bellwether for related trials.</li><li>What’s next: Yoon’s own trial has concluded with a verdict expected February 19, and prosecutors have sought the death penalty though some observers expect life imprisonment.</li></ul><blockquote>We sentence the defendant to 23 years in prison. - Lee Jin-gwan</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Seoul Central District Court: The court said Han neglected his duty to protect constitutional order by giving procedural legitimacy to the martial-law decree during a cabinet meeting and ordered his immediate detention.
