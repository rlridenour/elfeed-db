<p>David Barnard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the podcast I talk with John about the fascinating 40-year
history of Apple’s developer relations, how almost going bankrupt
in the 1990s shaped today’s control-focused approach, and why we
might need an “App Store 3.0” reset.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/07/19/cortex-hurley-interview-with-yours-truly">another</a> fun appearance on a podcast. There’s a good transcript too, if you’re more of a reader than a listener.</p>
