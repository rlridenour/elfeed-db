<p>A few things I learned recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing libraries with <code>pip install --user</code> on Debian will override the dependencies of system Python packages</li>
<li>But this isn&rsquo;t true with Homebrew or (I believe) Fedora</li>
</ul>
<p>(I wrote a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/3f3da9a557bfff478f6f0145f1b6b52f">a quick gist</a> about my
explorations here but Python packaging is a complicated enough topic that I didn&rsquo;t
want to expand it into a whole blog post, it gave me a lot of appreciation for
the folks working on this)</p>
