<p>I love Emacs, org-mode, and Journelly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Show thumbnails in dired so you know which pictures you want to resize, no problem.</li>
<li>Resize 20 pictures with dwim by mistake because you marked ALL of them. Oops.</li>
<li>No problem: <code>dired-mark-files-regexp</code>, mark all files that end with x750, delete with one keystroke</li>
<li>Round two, mark the ones you actually want this time.</li>
<li>Move them all to the download folder with one keystroke.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then to organize all my journal entries from <code>journelly.org</code> to <code>journal.org</code>, sort them by the order in the journal, just mark them all and use org sort alphabetically. Poof, done.</p>
<p>A whole day full of notes with pictures is now organized in a way I understand, with work-related notes filed into their tasks neatly, with an org-id link connecting them to the meeting header I have tomorrow.</p>
<p>Can you be more organized than that? Show me one program that does all of that. I didn&rsquo;t pay anyone, and the software is free.</p>
