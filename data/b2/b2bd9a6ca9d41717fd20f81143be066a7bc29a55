My recent post on <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13188">Markdown Versus Org Mode</a> engendered some limited but spirited engagement so I thought it would be nice to followup by writing about a post I&rsquo;ve had sitting in a browser tab for sometime. Piotr Migdał writes that  <a href="https://p.migdal.pl/blog/2025/02/markdown-saves/#user-content-fnref-blog">If it is worth keeping, save it in Markdown</a>. The title may seem aggressively pro Markdown but the point of Migdal&rsquo;s post is to embrace plain text as your data storage medium. He just happens to use Markdown but mentions Org mode as another equally good choice.

<p>
His point is that as long as there are computers and UTF-8, your data will be safe if you store it as plain text. That&rsquo;s important because, as he says, &ldquo;If you publish something online, sooner or later, it will vanish.&rdquo; The only way to be safe is to save your data in some sort of plain text. This is consistent with my <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13171">opt-stated rule</a> not to entrust the only copy of your data to a third party.

A lot of Migdal&rsquo;s post is how he goes about this. My case is simple. I write virtually everything in Org mode that gets saved in one Org file or another or, perhaps, in my email archive. The only exception is my texts which I generally write using <a href="https://github.com/tecosaur/emacs-everywhere">emacs-everywhere</a> but don&rsquo;t bother saving. It wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to put a wrapper around emacs-everywhere to save my side of the conversation but I&rsquo;d still be missing the other side. In any event, most of my texts aren&rsquo;t worth saving.

Migdal makes a good point and his post is worth reading.</p>
