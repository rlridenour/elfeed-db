<p>So, to fix the KeePassXC issue for Zen Browser, I went the route of installing it from tarball instead of flatpak. This is not a Zen problem - it&rsquo;s an issue with how KeePassXC works, and the nature of flatpak. Automatic updates work.</p>
<p>Learned a lot of good stuff. Notes will follow.</p>
