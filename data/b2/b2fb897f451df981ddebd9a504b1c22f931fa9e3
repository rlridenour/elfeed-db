<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is traveling to China this week to pursue improved political and economic ties with Beijing, as his government looks for ways to lift Britain’s sluggish economy. The visit—set to include meetings with Chinese leaders and a brief stop in Tokyo—comes as many countries seek trade and investment with China while also trying to avoid friction with President Donald Trump’s administration in Washington. UK officials and commentators say Starmer aims to engage China without weakening coordination with close allies, while the trip also spotlights sensitive issues such as Hong Kong, the planned large Chinese embassy in London, and the case of British citizen Jimmy Lai.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JXHAQT0eZEUKsmkLFDQrKweD7p6GFNfZXlW1NlL2WNeI7DS6h4LMkq1Jvm84IGxUcXo0TjtUneGDuh2EIEblzTMXUt8ZJKuY2EWU1jqzjZX0Ht680TD6A117A_3Eh-k567VrXojqcjbKazwFWwBrQoEjUzP6lLU40QPEnbsBwIe_GiMXSDk-OpLZl8puB14QBV6NLTiSkq75qJRml_4' alt='Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, attending a meeting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2024.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Trip schedule: Chinese government statements and UK officials said Starmer will be in China from Thursday to Saturday and will make a brief stop in Tokyo.</li><li>Diplomatic first: The visit is described as the first official trip to China by a UK prime minister since 2018.</li><li>Negotiating aims: Commentary described Starmer’s goals as resetting bilateral relations, boosting trade and investment, and seeking visa and embassy reciprocity in dealings with Xi Jinping’s government.</li><li>Domestic sensitivities: UK-China frictions highlighted in coverage include debate over a large new Chinese embassy in London, tensions over Hong Kong, and Jimmy Lai’s conviction.</li><li>Wider trend: Coverage noted a broader wave of leaders going to Beijing for deals, reflecting China’s push for trade ties even as partners weigh possible U.S. reprisals.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>UK government (Starmer): Starmer has emphasized the UK sees &#x27;significant opportunities&#x27; for British businesses and has rejected the idea he is strengthening ties with China at the expense of allies.
