<p>During a cabinet meeting in Washington, President Trump said he does not want Somali immigrants in the United States, described Somali migrants in Minnesota as &quot;garbage,&quot; and urged them to return to Somalia to &quot;fix&quot; their country instead of remaining in the US. His remarks came as US media reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been instructed to ramp up immigration enforcement in Minnesota’s Twin Cities region, which is home to the largest Somali-American community in the country. The president linked his comments to a major social services fraud case in Minnesota that prosecutors say involved false billing by individuals, including Somali Americans, alleging that Somali migrants relied too heavily on the US welfare system and contributed little to the country. Somali-American leaders and allies say the language is dehumanizing and fear the rhetoric, combined with reported ICE &quot;strike teams,&quot; will stigmatize an entire community for the alleged crimes of a few and increase anxiety among both documented and undocumented residents. At the same time, community organizations and elected representatives are speaking out forcefully, using the moment to highlight Somali Americans’ civic participation and contributions to Minnesota and US public life.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/1Fyhr3ZlNQNf8snBS_uWtJl2YZ0GlkUsjsh5Rmk_xpa4COE3IUehh_pos0vkYL1rPH7SPGFG7lNouVgKYZ0KtLIs4-vlR0WBnjrfRQYOJYKvbVYOXv450F6LOL_HL1ChDoYz1Em1whFKmJftZzZlLB1p7zwm5-su79fPmF-KEn7CitrfrXRWNJF5Lfzx0Lue1B8lMboqLsZRYCatnFo23fD0ugWtXIKLiVymZTZ7P7gyy85EV3ak11rvEZQstmaXXrikQZ4zvmifdseoTGtpEqK6H0XENEEuTrT08bmKVld87J7QAHkjzhkFlf_bkKZYgoAUjWHrAgDjQnKAzyvjKjetdiYi862LBJQ4UsPiC0o4T1xDE1KS2DGCrsvwuOyug4x_MMOLA2o9mc6YhrZ9tCegHx4xf-VycIY5I0TBD14' alt='President Trump speaks during the cabinet meeting where he criticized Somali immigrants.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Planned ICE actions: Reports say ICE intends to deploy &quot;strike teams&quot; of federal immigration officers to the Minneapolis–St Paul area this week to intensify enforcement operations focused on undocumented Somali immigrants.</li><li>Fraud case backdrop: The remarks followed a Minnesota scandal in which prosecutors allege more than $1 billion was paid out for non‑existent social services through fraudulent billing, with officials saying many suspect organizations were tied to members of the Somali diaspora.</li><li>Omar’s sharp response: Representative Ilhan Omar, who was born in Somalia and represents a Minnesota district, condemned the president’s comments as racist and &quot;creepy,&quot; and said he was targeting her and her community personally.</li><li>Community outcry: Somali-American groups in Minnesota organized public statements and meetings expressing fear for community safety, arguing that the president’s language treats all Somalis as criminals and may embolden harassment.</li><li>Media framing differences: Coverage ranged from describing the remarks as a &quot;tirade&quot; or &quot;xenophobic rant&quot; to explicitly characterizing planned enforcement as an expansion of asylum restrictions and aggressive deportation efforts.</li></ul><blockquote>We don&#x27;t want them in our country - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He argued that Somalis in Minnesota had &quot;ripped off&quot; the state’s welfare system and that the US &quot;will go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country,&quot; saying they should return to Somalia and repair their homeland instead..
