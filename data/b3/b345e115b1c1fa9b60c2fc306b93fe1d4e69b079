I have an orgmode item that looks like this:
** STARTED [#A] Planning, Emails &amp; Social [48/56] &lt;2020-03-23 Mon 08:15-09:00 +1d&gt; This item is a target for my capture-from-email, so TODO items are constantly added beneath. The result is that the count always end up as [0/0] in my agenda until I manually visit the headline and do a C-c # to update it to the proper count; I&rsquo;m not sure why this is, but I would love to fix it somehow.
