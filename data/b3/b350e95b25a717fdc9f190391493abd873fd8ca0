<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  Earlier this year Synology announced that you&rsquo;d&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.synology.com/en-us/DSM/tutorial/Drive_compatibility_policies" rel="noopener noreferrer">need to use Synology-branded hard drives</a>&nbsp;in its 2025 line of &ldquo;Plus&rdquo; branded network-attached storage devices if you wanted full functionality. While you could theoretically use a non-Synology drive with the Synology DiskStation DS225+, DS425+, DS925+ and other models, you&rsquo;d be unable to create data storage pools, or use volume deduplication.

The change of direction was revealed in <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-eu/company/news/article/dsm73/Synology" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Synology press release</a> announcing DiskStation Manager 7.3, the OS that runs the company&rsquo;s Plus line of NAS hardware.</p>
<p id="p4">This is great news for Mac users who felt betrayed by Synology&rsquo;s previous announcement. However, as <a href="https://liliputing.com/synology-backtracks-and-adds-3rd-party-hard-drive-support-to-its-2025-nas-lineup-network-attached-storage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linder also points out</a> it does not change the fact that the same &ldquo;Plus&rdquo; series of 2025 NAS hardware does not include hardware-accelerated transcoding of H.264 and HEVC video, which previous models supported.</p>
