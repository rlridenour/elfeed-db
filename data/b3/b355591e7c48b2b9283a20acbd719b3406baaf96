A week and a half ago, Bozhidar Batsov stirred up a storm by claiming that <a href="https://batsov.com/articles/2025/04/07/emacs-startup-time-does-not-matter/">Emacs startup time doesn&rsquo;t matter</a>. There was much foaming at the mouth but I agreed with Batsov: Emacs startup time hardly every matters. When it does, it is in <i>very</i> special circumstances that, happily, most of us never experience.
</p>
<p>
At the end of <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12903">my post</a> on the matter, I said that if your Emacs startup time <i>is</i> lengthy, it probably indicates a problem with your configuration. Batsov apparently believes the same and in a new post <a href="https://batsov.com/articles/2025/04/17/using-use-package-the-right-way/#fnref:2">offers some advice for addressing that problem</a>.
</p>
<p>
He frames his discussion in terms of the <code>use-package</code> macro that most people use. The secret, he says, is to delay loading packages until they are needed. That makes sense because loading a single package won&rsquo;t take long but loading, say, a hundred may add significant time to your init time. By deferring the loading, you speed up Emacs&rsquo; startup time at the cost of adding a tiny delay later when you first actually need a package.

Batsov&rsquo;s suggestions are a bit complex but the TL;DR is to avoid the <code>:preface</code>, <code>:init</code>. and <code>:config</code> keywords. You should definitely read his post for the details. Ironically, <a href="https://batsov.com/articles/2025/04/17/using-use-package-the-right-way/#fn:1">he doesn&rsquo;t follow his own advice</a> because, as he says, Emacs startup time doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
