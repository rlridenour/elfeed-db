<p>In the latest development on efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, US and Ukrainian delegations meeting in Geneva say they have drafted an “updated and refined peace framework” based on President Trump’s 28‑point proposal, which now must be finalized by President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Sunday’s sessions “tremendous,” “very optimistic,” and “probably the most productive and meaningful meeting” since the start of Trump’s current term, while Ukrainian chief of staff Andriy Yermak described them as “very good progress” and a “very productive first session”. A joint US‑Ukraine statement stresses that any eventual deal must “fully uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty” and deliver a “just and lasting peace,” after the original draft drew criticism for appearing to accept Russian demands on territory, NATO, and Ukraine’s military size. European governments, who circulated their own alternative ideas after saying they were not consulted on the initial US‑Russia draft, are now working on a parallel track to influence the final text, while some US lawmakers from both parties push for tougher sanctions to keep pressure on Moscow during the talks.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/runtFKJGDlQwWQa8PKiINfQ1n522CEIziZLRUtqEnwA2chiKnSbglb3VllYFzMgEoKTprUCbRunwu792RqG1Kk3SSNAIt-2w89Wp6aNgtosENhTdasWdAISaKT1w8fBxwCgPdziIOJiMKX_w4MbGNPS6DHuHIC_9RGwp0WcbyBKF' alt='Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio brief the press after peace framework talks in Geneva.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Key draft changes: Ukrainian officials say the new version of the framework now reflects “most of Ukraine’s key priorities,” including language that any agreement must fully protect its sovereignty, after the earlier text was criticized for accepting Russian terms on territorial concessions and NATO renunciation.</li><li>European counter‑proposals: Several European states prepared their own peace outline omitting pro‑Russia provisions from the leaked US‑backed document, and are using meetings around an EU gathering to push for a united European line before further negotiations with Washington and Kyiv.</li><li>Trump’s public pressure: President Trump set a deadline later this week for Zelenskyy to accept his peace plan, complained that Ukrainian leaders showed “zero gratitude,” and said Europe was still buying Russian oil even as US weapons continued to flow to Kyiv.</li><li>Domestic US debate: US senators from both parties have questioned the plan, with some saying Rubio privately described the original draft as a Russian “wish list” (a claim the State Department denies), while others push bipartisan legislation for sweeping secondary sanctions on Russia’s trading partners to strengthen Washington’s negotiating leverage.</li><li>Ukrainian public concerns: Residents and survivors in war‑hit Ukrainian communities fear aspects of the peace plan such as proposed amnesties for Russian troops could encourage impunity and further violence, and some see territorial concessions after years of fighting as unacceptable.</li></ul><blockquote>We all continue working with partners, especially the United States, to look for compromises that will strengthen but not weaken us. - Volodymyr Zelenskyy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US government: Washington says the Geneva talks marked a “significant step forward,” with Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasizing that negotiators made a “tremendous amount of progress” on narrowing open items in the framework while insisting that any final deal needs Russia’s agreement to be durable.
