<p>As part of a flurry of posts on Daring Fireball yesterday afternoon, John Gruber said something that really seemed directed at me. It was a sort of throwaway comment in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/22/ritholtz-sorry-steve">the post about Apple Stores</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the big partners, like CompUSA, absolutely sucked at showcasing the Mac. Their demo machines were frequently broken.</p>

<p>I was the reason one of those demo machines was frequently broken.</p>
<p>It was in the early 2000s, and there was a CompUSA near my office that I visited frequently. This was during my eight-year Mac hiatus, but I was still interested in what Apple was doing. I kept tabs on the state of the hardware and on OS X to see if and when it was time for me to return from the Linux wilderness.</p>
<p>One of the Macs my local CompUSA had out on display in its Apple ghetto was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4_Cube">G4 Cube</a>. I had read somewhere that they ran hot, so one day I put my hand a few inches over the Cube to feel the convective flow rising out of the top grille. The machine immediately overheated and shut down to protect itself.</p>
<p>Let me be clear (as clear as the Cube). I didn’t put my hand <em>on</em> the grille—it was at least 3–4 inches above it. But that was enough. And from that day forward, every time I passed that Cube, I put my hand above it and caused a crash.</p>
<p>So in my own way, I was part of the success of Apple Stores.</p>
