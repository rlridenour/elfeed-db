<p>President Trump said he believes Iran wants a deal and indicated he plans to speak with Iranian leaders, while the United States moves additional naval forces toward the region. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran is open to “fair and equitable” negotiations but rejects including Iran’s defense capabilities—particularly its missile program—in any talks. Alongside the military signaling, multiple regional governments are pushing diplomacy to prevent a wider conflict. Pakistan publicly opposed any use of force and urged sustained dialogue, while Türkiye hosted Araghchi as it stepped up mediation efforts. Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have also urged de-escalation and said they will not allow their airspace or territory to be used for an attack, reflecting concerns about spillover risks for the region.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Lspjldr4GdgpXq-G3wS6IbmHhGLvGMjuc7ncPkoBrF46wi9HkHhbrdWGQn0WKXP-tXTDBaKzDYogjZ-lMcg9cHYnbWXZKzKHeQkFu5HDJFe0' alt='US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington on Jan. 30, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>US posture: US officials said the Pentagon would be ready to carry out whatever President Trump decides, as additional warships deploy to the Middle East alongside the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln.</li><li>Iran red lines: Iran signaled it would not negotiate with the US on ballistic missiles, while keeping the door open to nuclear-related talks if conducted on equal terms.</li><li>Regional mediation: Türkiye, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have engaged in diplomatic efforts to avert a confrontation, with Istanbul hosting Araghchi and Ankara presenting itself as a channel to reduce tensions.</li><li>Gulf constraints: Saudi Arabia and the UAE publicly said they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used in an attack on Iran, underscoring regional efforts to limit escalation pathways.</li><li>Energy jitters: Oil prices hovered near multi-month highs as markets weighed the risk of disruption tied to possible US action, adding to broader regional economic worries.</li></ul><blockquote>Hopefully, we’ll make a deal.
