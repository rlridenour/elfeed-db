<p>I combined elements from two recipes: <a href="https://thefoodmedic.co.uk/2020/01/3-ingredient-oatmeal-cookies/">3 Ingredient oatmeal cookies (The Food Medic)</a>, Amy's <a href="https://amyshealthybaking.com/blog/2018/01/21/banana-oatmeal-raisin-cookies/">Healthy Banana Oatmeal Raisin Cookies (Amy's Healthy Baking)</a> and added my own touches.</p>
<h2>Preheat oven</h2>
<p>Preheat the oven at 180°C.</p>
<h2>Mash bananas</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 medium ripe bananas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mash until bananas have no significant lumps.</p>
<h2>Mix most ingredients (except oats)</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter.</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon of ground cardamom.</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon of vanilla.</li>
<li>1/3 cup raisins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the peanut butter, cinnamon, cardamom, and vanilla into the mashed bananas. Mix well. Add raisins and mix a little further to spread them out.</p>
<h2>Add oats</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 3/4 cups of oats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the oats to the mix in a few rounds to ensure its evenly mixed.</p>
<h2>Flattened balls in tray</h2>
<p>Make balls, place on baking tray, and gently flatten. They'll be on the chunky side.</p>
<p><em>Note: They won't spread as much as traditional cookies.</em></p>
<h2>Bake for 15 mins</h2>
<p>Bake for about 15 minutes or until golden.</p>
<h2>Let cool off and enjoy</h2>
<p>Wait a little and nom nom nom…</p>
