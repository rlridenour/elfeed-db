A few years ago, I made a simple web app in <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Flask</a> to deal with some text processing problems from my daily work. It has two main features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature #1: generating <code class="verbatim">compile_commands.json</code> for GNU Makefile projects written in C/C++ using the output of the <code class="verbatim">make</code> command. Because, unlike CMake, the make command can&#39;t generate it.</li>
<li>Feature #2: extract text using Python regex. It&#39;s handy when I feel like sed/awk/grep&#39;s line-oriented processing isn&#39;t enough for the task at hand.</li>
</ul>
