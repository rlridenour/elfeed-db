<blockquote>
  <p>The Apple Maps EV Routing option will allow Toyota BEV users to
plan travel routes that include stops for charging. Without it,
drivers would have had to exit out of CarPlay in order to create a
route that included charging stops.</p>

<p>Apple Maps’ EV Routing feature uses real-time data from the
vehicle to guide drivers to their destinations more efficiently,
automatically suggesting charging stops when needed. The system
takes into account elevation changes and other driving conditions
to decide when a recharge is necessary. If the vehicle’s battery
level becomes too low, Apple Maps will automatically direct the
driver to the nearest compatible charging station.</p>
