<p>This is Euclid&#8217;s proof of the Pythagorean theorem &#8212; Schopenhauer called it a &#8220;brilliant piece of perversity&#8221; for its needless complexity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Erect a square on each leg of a right triangle. From the triangle&#8217;s right angle, A, draw a line parallel to BD and CE. This will intersect BC and DE perpendicularly at K and L.</li>
<li>Draw segments CF and AD, forming triangles BCF and BDA.</li>
<li>Because angles CAB and BAG are both right angles, C, A, and G are collinear.</li>
<li>Because angles CBD and FBA are both right angles, angle ABD equals angle FBC, since each is the sum of a right angle and angle ABC.</li>
<li>Since AB is equal to FB, BD is equal to BC, and angle ABD equals angle FBC, triangle ABD is congruent to triangle FBC.</li>
<li>Since A-K-L is a straight line that&#8217;s parallel to BD, rectangle BDLK has twice the area of triangle ABD, because they share base BD and have the same altitude, BK, a line perpendicular to their common base and connecting parallel lines BD and AL.</li>
<li>By similar reasoning, since C is collinear with A and G, and this line is parallel to FB, square BAGF must be twice the area of triangle FBC.</li>
<li>Therefore, rectangle BDLK has the same area as square BAGF, AB<sup>2</sup>.</li>
<li>By applying the same reasoning to the other side of the figure, it can be shown that rectangle CKLE has the same area as square ACIH, AC<sup>2</sup>.</li>
<li>Adding these two results, we get AB<sup>2</sup> + AC<sup>2</sup> = BD × BK + KL × KC.</li>
<li>Since BD = KL, BD × BK + KL × KC = BD(BK + KC) = BD × BC.</li>
<li>Therefore, since CBDE is a square, AB<sup>2</sup> + AC<sup>2</sup> = BC<sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ol>
