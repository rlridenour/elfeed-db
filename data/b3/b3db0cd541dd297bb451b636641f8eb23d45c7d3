<p>Norbert Heger <a href="https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/">gets to the bottom</a> of a problem I’ve been having lately—my inability to resize macOS Tahoe windows at their corners:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It turns out that my initial click in the window corner instinctively happens in an area where the window doesn’t respond to it. The window expects this click to happen in an area of 19 × 19 pixels, located near the window corner.</p>
<p>  If the window had no rounded corners at all, 62% of that area would lie inside the window… But due to the huge corner radius in Tahoe, most of it – about 75% – now lies outside the window.

<p>That’s right, folks, the solution to resizing the corner of a window in Tahoe is to click <em>outside the edge of the window</em>. I can’t even.</p>
