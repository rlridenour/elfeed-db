<p>In 1907, historian Reginald Hine, photographer Thomas Latchmore, and artist F.L. Griggs took a camera to Hertfordshire&#8217;s Minsden Chapel hoping to photograph the ghost of a murdered monk whose spirit was said to haunt the place. Hine published this photo in his 1929 <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.77270/page/n45/mode/2up"><em>History of Hitchin</em></a>, pointing out &#8220;the cowled apparition whose form can faintly be discerned&#8221; in the image:</p>

<p>In 1930 Latchmore admitted that the image had been a hoax, created with a double exposure; the ghostly figure may be Hine himself.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re at it: In 1963 by the Rev. Kenneth Lord took this photo in the Church of Christ the Consoler on the grounds of Newby Hall in North Yorkshire:</p>

<p>Ostensibly the figure is another ghostly monk, this one wearing a shroud over its face. If it&#8217;s not a double exposure then the figure stands as much as 9 feet tall; make your own judgment.</p>
<p>And a reader sent this image in to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/strand-1897-v-14/page/117/mode/2up"><em>Strand</em></a> in July 1897:</p>

<p>Taken at Scale Force, the Lake District&#8217;s highest waterfall, &#8220;It is a perfect representation of a stately, long-bearded old man, clothed in a flowing robe, with a crown and sceptre. &#8230; The form is perfect natural. I did not notice it until after the photo was developed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, as recently as 2006 the old man was still there:</p>
