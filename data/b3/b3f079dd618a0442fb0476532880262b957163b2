<p id="p2">Yesterday, <a href="https://youtu.be/M3w-j7Wtbvo?si=Hco8JUdpOO1qbPrB" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry published their review of the iPhone 17 Pro</a>, which as you&rsquo;d expect, focuses on the Pro model&rsquo;s gaming capabilities. Tested against iPhone 13 and 15 Pros and using a series of benchmark tests as well as real-world gameplay, Digital Foundry&rsquo;s tests revealed significant improvements in several areas, including:</p>
<ul id="ul3"><li>GPU performance;</li>
<li>Ray tracing capabilities;</li>
<li>Second-generation dynamic caching; and</li>
<li>Improved thermals.</li>
</ul><div class="media-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3w-j7Wtbvo?si=UWkvktjiU04bN2Gn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p id="p5">Benchmarks are one thing, but Digital Foundry&rsquo;s tests also revealed real-world benefits to the iPhone 17 Pro, such as:</p>
<ul id="ul6"><li>a 60% performance increase over the iPhone 15 Pro on <em>Resident Evil Village</em>,</li>
<li>the elimination of freezing and big frame rate drops in <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Mirage</em>,</li>
<li>more reliable 30 fps gameplay in <em>Death Stranding.</em></li>
</ul><p id="p7">Those are significant improvements in just two generations of the A-series chips.</p>
<p id="p8">What really caught my eye, though, was the impact of cooling. The iPhone 17 Pro uses a vapor chamber and aluminum chassis to help cool the device and keep its chips running at full speed longer. When Digital Foundry placed the 17 Pro on a desk fan, it became clear just how important that cooling is.</p>
<p id="p9">Running a benchmark stress test with air blowing across the back of the iPhone 17 Pro reduced the performance drop by roughly 50%. With those sorts of results, I expect external cooling solutions like <a href="https://amzn.to/4mURSOB" rel="noopener noreferrer">this X5s telescopic controller and FX5 Cooler combo from GameSir</a> to become a popular accessory in the coming year, so of course, I&rsquo;ve ordered one and will report back soon.</p>
