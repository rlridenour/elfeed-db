<p>In Hong Kong’s Tai Po district, authorities say at least 128 people have died after a fire ripped through the Wang Fuk Court public housing complex, in what officials describe as the city’s worst blaze in roughly seven decades. The fire began on Wednesday afternoon and spread rapidly across bamboo scaffolding and plastic mesh wrapped around multiple towers undergoing renovation, while residents report that building fire alarms did not sound as the flames grew. After more than 40 hours of work, firefighters declared the main firefighting operations over on Friday morning, but dozens remained in hospital and around 200 residents were still unaccounted for as families checked shelters and hospital lists for missing relatives. Police have arrested three leaders of the renovation contractor, Prestige Construction, on suspicion of manslaughter, alleging “grossly negligent” use of highly flammable materials as investigators and the public scrutinise whether safety rules and residents’ past complaints were ignored.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/EElD0hNWCvXujm5x-L9vzNW7wAQbrvhILn0qE2_7AxOzgy47ys_AXgIcQMAx0Bq8v6KwNuQVEPFNHYa1yvYYb7qlJA3bLIPBsKGFKhoffyCC' alt='Smoke rises from the Wang Fuk Court apartment towers in Tai Po as firefighters battle Hong Kong’s deadliest blaze in decades.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Complex conditions: The Wang Fuk Court estate contains about 2,000 flats in eight blocks housing more than 4,600 residents, many of whom were trapped because smoke and heat made stairwells impassable as the blaze spread vertically along the wrapped exterior.</li><li>Firefighter sacrifices: Among the dead was a 37‑year‑old firefighter who lost contact with his team and was later found with facial burns, while at least a dozen other firefighters were injured during the prolonged rescue operations.</li><li>Government response: Hong Kong’s chief executive ordered inspections of all public housing sites undergoing major renovation, and security officials pledged a thorough criminal probe into how construction practices and oversight may have contributed to the disaster.</li><li>Shelters and support: Authorities opened at least eight temporary shelters that have received around 900 displaced residents, where volunteers and local groups distributed food and daily necessities as families waited for news.</li><li>Residents’ complaints: Local media report that some tenants had previously raised concerns about renovation plans, blocked escape routes and fire risks around the scaffolding, prompting renewed debate over whether these warnings were adequately addressed before the incident.</li></ul><blockquote>We have reason to believe that the company’s responsible parties were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties - Eileen Chung, Hong Kong police superintendent</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Hong Kong government: Officials expressed condolences to victims’ families, promised financial assistance for the injured, and vowed a full investigation into what they describe as the deadliest urban fire since the late 1940s.
