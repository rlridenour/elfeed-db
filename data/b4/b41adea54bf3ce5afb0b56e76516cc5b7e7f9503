<p>&#8220;My experiences have led me to believe that one of the best things that men in a professional field can do for feminism is to learn to take sexual and romantic rejection well.&#8221;<span id="more-54449"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the observations of a philosopher, going by the pseudonym &#8220;Alex Rails&#8221;, in the following guest post on issues at the intersection of sexual and professional ethics.</p>
<p>That description may lead one to think this post is about sexual harassment, and in a way it is, but it is mainly a virtue-based approach to the ethics of sexual relationships and flings between people in the profession, or, in the author&#8217;s terms, what it means to be a strong or weak &#8220;player&#8221;.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the other posts in the summer series, I did not solicit this one. It came to me from a pseudonymous author, and, reading an early draft, I was initially uncertain about proceeding with it, for surely there are some readers who will think that Rails is talking about how to do something bad well. But I think that if that&#8217;s your view, then you might frame what follows as a kind of non-ideal virtue theory. Alternatively, you might think, for a few reasons, that the optimal amount of sexual flings among people in the profession is, as Rails says, &#8220;not zero,&#8221; and that the question of how to engage in this behavior, given its moral riskiness, is worthwhile.</p>
<p>I do not know Rails&#8217; identity, but a third party I&#8217;m acquainted with who does confirmed that Rails is a tenured philosopher at a good university, writing sincerely and honestly. (If you want to reach out to Rails personally, you can do so by email to <a href="mailto:alexrails313@proton.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alexrails313@proton.me</a>.)</p>
<p>Discussion is welcome, but I ask that, given the subject matter, people exercise a bit of care with their comments. The comments section is <em>not </em>the place to name &#8220;players,&#8221; be they strong or weak, otherwise discuss the sex lives of identifiable individuals. If you wish to comment using a pseudonym but you&#8217;ve commented here previously under your real name, be sure to enter <em>both a new name and a new email address</em> when you comment, so your identity is not inadvertently revealed.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">To Philosophers of Easy Virtue<br />
<strong><em>by &#8220;Alex Rails&#8221;</em></strong></h2>
<p>Some of us are secretly banging each other. You know who you are. Some of you make a sport out of it. Some of you bring condoms to conferences. Some of you read an impeccable paper and cannot help but check what the author looks like, because <em>they might be hot</em>. Since eroticism is a part of your life, it is part of how you network within your discipline. You are what I will call a <em>player</em>.</p>
<p>I am a player too. I have played some great games. Others ended quite badly. So far, I have filed two complaints for work-related sexual misconduct. One of “my victims” was forced to give up their job, due to games that involved me.</p>
<p>As well as a player, I am a moral philosopher, of the “do things that lead to flourishing”-type. After two such doomed escapades, I began to wonder whether my playerhood is contributing to my flourishing. What effect does my playerhood have on my discipline? I know that I am not the only player, and many of us struggle with these questions. As I have thought about this a lot, I wanted to share my thoughts&#8212;pseudonymously&#8212;with other players out there, and others who might care to learn more about us. This is not a confession or warning and I do not offer much in recommendations. This is a warm letter from one player to another.</p>
<h3>Philosopher Players</h3>
<p>We philosopher players are hedonists&#8212;in life, if not on paper. Some are desperate for connection, some use sex to get ahead in their careers. We are of all genders. I go for women and men, though men are generally easier to pull for me. And I attract them by defending unorthodox views with a smoky voice. In my experience, players are no less interested in philosophy than the non-players. In fact, we often burn for philosophy. For many of us, our own philosophy is intertwined with our mind and our body, and the philosophy of others often with their mind and body. A fling or romance can open a window into where someone’s philosophy comes from. Having sex can be doing philosophy. Indeed, for some of us, an ambition to philosophical greatness is a quasi-sexual desire.</p>
<p>It is not fair to ask the question “how does playerhood affect philosophy” without asking “how does philosophy affect playerhood?” We players are a rare species. And like any species, we are adapted to a hostile environment. Our environment is dominated by norms of monogamy, stigmas about sex, and solid walls of professional conduct and hierarchy. According to ideals that are usually tacit and rarely articulated, the discipline must be a clean, safe, sexless space. Many of us probably agree that this is a good thing for some contexts, like classrooms or PhD supervision. But the sexlessness norm applies in every other professional context too. To get around this, we have developed a variety of mechanisms that protect our ability to play, such as stealth, compartmentalization, brazenness, or our own versions of feminism. Most importantly, some of us have developed skill. We have become <em>skillful players</em>.</p>
<h3>Being a Skillful Player</h3>
<p>What do I mean by being skillful as a player? I am not talking about sexual technique. Nor am I talking about the ability to flirt and seduce. I mean the ability of the player to skillfully combine their games, such as conference flings, with professional conduct inside the discipline: the delicate before- and after-care of seducing another philosopher. Knowing how to do your thing without causing trouble. Knowing whom to seduce (for instance, generally speaking, seducing <em>up the hierarchy</em> is safer than seducing <em>down</em>.) Knowing how and when is important, too. One must also know how to resist the urge to brag too much or to publicize one’s flings. These discipline-specific sexual skills hang together with broader virtues that are important for having a good sex life in general. This includes self-reflection and honesty about what one wants and doesn’t want, and appropriate respect for what the other wants (say, discretion, using contraceptives, or having the consent of one’s partner). Such skills and virtues are important to maintain one’s habit of having flings&#8212;or the possibility of flings. This possibility loads philosophizing with an additional excitement. Excitement and sex are very pleasurable. Romances and flings can also be insightful, life-altering and meaningful. When philosophy is one’s vocation, a fling that happens in the context of one’s vocation can be especially meaningful, for oneself as a philosopher as well as a person. According to a poll on this site, <a href="https://dailynous.com/2014/07/25/do-you-want-to-date-a-philosopher/">many of us would prefer to date other philosophers</a>! For this reason, the ideal amount of sex that should be had within the discipline is not zero, even though stigma and norms might seem to suggest it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge with shagging other philosophers is the fact that once one has dropped the professional masks with a given person, it is hard to look at that person again with the mask on. While this is also true of forming a friendship, or even seeing someone drunk, sex can be a particularly jarring demasker because the sexual self is generally not revealed in a professional context. While there is nothing strange about revealing your <em>friendship</em> with someone at a work setting, revealing a sexual affair is <em>not done</em>, meaning you must “act normal” around each other. A skilled philosopher player knows not to throw the mask out, because the mask can still serve its purpose. A skilled player can often put the mask on again comfortably if needed, even if it is just the two of you. A skilled player can estimate when the sex-thing with someone is over and when one mask, or another, is desired again. A skilled player can take a hint.</p>
<p>As a researcher, one works in an institution and in a field. The field is hierarchical. Problematic relations can happen between a senior in one institution and a junior in another. There is no easy rule for deciding who is available to you unproblematically, and who isn’t. Having sex with someone you are work-wise entangled with, or quasi-entangled with, rips a tear into the fabric of academic conduct norms. The skilled player has needle and thread ready to mend the rip if needed and the tailor’s ability to anticipate where the fabric will or won’t stretch. It is not easy to do this, and the skill of the skilled player is a product of much effort and self-development. If that’s you, bravo!</p>
<p>One cannot be a player alone. Shaggers require shaggees. Ideally, a skilled player gets with another skilled player. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes a skilled player has the misfortune to stumble on, what I will call a <em>weak player.</em></p>
<h3>Weak Players</h3>
<p>A weak player is someone who has the desire to sleep around, and perhaps does, but does not yet possess the virtues to combine this seamlessly with their professional role. Academia has many weak players. In fact, academia systematically creates weak players. Academics, many of them bookish nerds, often lead a life of work and no play and might have few non-academic social contacts due to frequent moving around, which means less opportunities to have sex, but also fewer friends to whom one can talk about these things candidly. We tend to fuse our identity and our work, and our work is often disembodied and sexless.</p>
<p>There are many types of weak players. For instance, some find the juxtaposition of work and play so awkward that they withdraw from each other at professional events and can no longer give a talk while the other is in the room. Others cannot take romantic or sexual rejection. Some expect others to manage their feelings of rejection. Some see work-related advantages as a “labor of love” and feel entitled to intimacy after helping someone out professionally. Some assume that a casual fling must develop into a serious relationship, or that a hookup must become a regular liaison, that “once” means “always from now on at every conference” or that having sex means no longer talking about philosophy.</p>
<p>People sometimes tend to think of misbehaving sex pests in academia as ruthless Casanovas and Don Juans. In my experience, this picture is incomplete. Some of them are naïve or bewildered pityfuck-beggars. Sometimes they are aware of their unskillfulness and desperation, and revel in it. “I am not a Don Juan type! This is hard for me, please don’t cancel me!”</p>
<p>Many of these types are self-proclaimed feminist allies. But everyone is a feminist ally until they get friendzoned. My experiences have led me to believe that one of the best things that men in a professional field can do for feminism is to learn to take sexual and romantic rejection well. Sitting on committees and insisting on hiring women, citing women, making a fuss over gender balance for a conference lineup is nice. But all these things can be mere virtue signaling, if one does not take responsibility for one’s feelings of rejection. The man who obsessed over me, pestered me for intimacy at conferences and threatened my career because I declined intimacy, having accepted it in the past, is acclaimed as a feminist ally at his institution. Freeing myself of his approaches was a long and painful process. Weak players ruin the game, and they ruin careers, especially women’s careers. The skillful, strong players are not the issue, neither is the practice of sleeping around necessarily. Weak players are.</p>
<p>Weak players are not a problem in all games. If I asked to join the basketball game on my street corner, I would probably be tolerated, even though I suck at basketball. There is no risk here. However, if I followed a ski jumper into the tower, pretended I knew what I was doing, put on the skis and dropped onto the slope, I would cause an awful accident and that would be 100% on me, not the experienced ski jumper I went with, even if she had flirted and invited me along. She does not know my skill level. I should know better than to do that.</p>
<p>In our discipline we have a norm of being tolerant towards novices. We do not like it when people put down junior scholars, even if they gave a bad conference talk or wrote a crappy draft. They are here to learn, and it is the job of more senior scholars to make sure that juniors carry the discipline to the future. We take responsibility for the young ones. We give constructive feedback, we encourage, and we tolerate their mistakes. Again, here, too, there is little risk. A philosopher does not generally ruin anyone’s life by giving a bad conference talk.</p>
<p>The case of sex with colleagues, especially junior colleagues, is different. It can be high reward, but high risk. You can play, but if you don’t follow the safety protocols, you should be stopped, and fast. And, preferably, grandly and embarrassingly, so that you (or others like you) do not try without the proper experience.</p>
<h3>Are Strong Players Absolved?</h3>
<p>What I have said so far comes down to this: “I, as a strong player, am allowed to play. But weak players should practice somewhere safe first.” There are plenty of good reasons to be suspicious of a claim like this. Strong players could still cause harm with their playing. A <a href="https://dailynous.com/2018/02/28/professors-dating-harassing-students/">post from a few years ago</a> reflects on how easily an educational setting can become sexualized when lecturers let even a little bit of their sexuality seep through into the classroom. The post quotes a piece in <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/there-is-no-liberal-right-to-sex-with-students">Times Higher Education</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As highlighted by a growing body of research, “available” (usually male) faculty members advertise that fact in subtle and not-so-subtle ways in order to cast a wide net. In so doing, they hijack the learning spaces for their own purposes. In philosophy, for instance, they might let it be known in seminars and classes that they are single or party to an “open” marriage, using the example of polygamy when talking about natural rights; even arguing in favour of extramarital affairs as their illustration of utilitarian reasoning. They may be doing it unconsciously, but it in effect sexualises the learning space for everyone.</em></p>
<p>Arguably, the same goes for conferences and other academic spaces. Additionally, a strong player might stumble upon a weak player, and thereby encourage the weak player to play, which is dangerous. These risks have weighed on my conscience. I should not hurt others if I can avoid it, and I care particularly about not hurting junior scholars and women in philosophy.</p>
<p>Even a strong player risks sexualizing the field, by throwing out a subtle flirt to see if the other responds, or flirting with a willing participant in the presence of others, or even simply by emanating sexual excitement at a professional event. This risk, just like the risk of other types of trouble, is precisely why being a strong player is difficult. A strong player knows how to mitigate this risk. A strong player does not “cast a wide net” and signal their sexual availability to everyone in the discipline, especially if they are in a position of relative power. They cast a narrow net for particular people, in particular situations, that can easily be retracted safely if it is not wanted. Again, a strong player can take a hint and they are looking out for them, too. Rather than sexualizing the field as a whole, a strong player judiciously creates pockets of sexualization in areas where they are desired by all parties. It is, therefore, in the interest of the discipline that we set high standards for strong playerhood. We, strong players, must keep learning.</p>
<p>A strong player may, at times, encourage a weak player to play, for example by sleeping with someone who turns out to be a weak player or by confiding in a weak player. While the onus should be on the weak player to know that they should not play, the reality is that responsibility tends to fall on the strong players. If you are a strong player who has encountered a weak player, you might know how exhausting that can be. Some compassionate strong players, having slept with a weak player, take on the difficult and often draining task of educating weak players. “Hey, I notice that you were harsher than usual in your comments on our shared paper/ your review of my book/ etc. It made me wonder: is something bothering you?” “It would make me more comfortable if we could compartmentalize our shared work and our sexual history. Would this be possible for you?” If the weak player fails to develop, then they indeed become a risk to the whole discipline. For this reason, it is important that the strong players are able to stop weak players in their tracks, for instance by breaking off the relationship, warning others or reporting them for misconduct. A strong player must be capable of doing this too, and not succumb to pity.</p>
<p>So far, I have only spoken of strong and weak players. Of course, there is a whole range of medium and mediocre players in between. Some of them will develop into strong players. The rest is a risk. If anything, having strong players around is essential. Strong players can spot weak ones, when they play, and know how to stop the damage by educating or reporting weak players. We, strong players can also advise weaker players, should they confide in us. Academia creates weak players but we can foster strong players.</p>
<p>Having strong players is also enriching for philosophy as a whole. Many world-changing philosophical works have been informed by romances with other philosophers. Think of de Beauvoir and Sartre’s complicated romance. For Plato, philosophy was a place for <em>eros</em>. And later Platonists, like Murdoch, whose philosophy centres on love has, no doubt, been influenced by her own erotic experiences in the discipline, some of which were problematic. Missed opportunities abound, too. Most of us can think of a few philosophers who would probably have produced better work (at least in some areas) had they been better players (I won’t mention the names that come to my mind, out of respect for devotees of these frustrated men.) The guidance of <em>eros </em>has certainly enhanced my own philosophy.</p>
<p>I write this as a player, but also as a victim of sexual malpractice in the discipline. I have thrived through playerhood, and suffered through it, too. My experiences do not lead me to conclude that we ought to try to keep the discipline sexless. That would be an unattainable and undesirable aim. Rather, our attitudes about sex in the profession should be sensitive to the skillfulness of those engaging in it.</p>
<p>So, I say to you, strong players: do your thing. Enjoy yourself! If a weak player gets professionally petty on you, teach them&#8212;or if need be, torch them; you’d be performing a service to the discipline. Have fun, colleagues, but play well.</p>
