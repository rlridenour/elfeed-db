<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/">Sacha Chua</a> mentioned how <a href="https://social.sachachua.com/@sacha/statuses/01JF94JQQNNRXMTKN3Y1774TFP">cool it would be to have an Emacs video index</a> like <a href="https://www.rubyvideo.dev/topics">Ruby Video</a>. I mentioned how I had similarly considered a low-tech solution, maybe powered by plain text (bonus points for <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org mode</a> of course).</p>
<p>A little later, Sacha <a href="https://social.sachachua.com/@sacha/statuses/01JFG5T3C6E88362DRDZN9ANA6">shared a preliminary video feed dump</a>, in org! With that, I wrote the <a href="https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/113682069315989397">first experiment to render the org feed</a> and <a href="https://emacs.tv/">emacs.tv</a> was born.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/hello-emacstv/screenshot.png" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://emacs.tv/">emacs.tv</a> is merely a few days old. Powered by an org feed (rendered client-side), but we can fetch and render in all sorts of ways. <a href="https://emacs.tv/">emacs.tv</a> brings it to the web, though I'm sure we can come up with all sorts of Emacs integrations. A new major mode? Or maybe convert the org feed to rss and plug into <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">elfeed</a>?</p>
<p>This is what a feed entry looks like:</p>
