<p>This is my entry to the <a href="https://curious.port111.com/2025/11/01/emacs-carnival-december-the-people.html">December Emacs blog Carnival</a> hosted by George Jones this month:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Emacs is the most people-centric technology I’ve ever used. I’m willing to bet that’s true for others as well.</p>

  <p>Who are your “People of Emacs”?</p>

<p>Apart from a brief University stint where we used Emacs to write some C code on our SUN terminals, my first year of Emacs was shaped by three people:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://saschafast.de">Sascha Fast</a>, my pal, then-roommate and <a href="https://zettelkasten.de">Zettelkasten</a> partner in crime, who found out about <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> and just had to get me on that after a brief experimentation to manage tasks and projects in plain text. Sascha had to force me to even give it a try because I didn’t want to spend time offboarding OmniFocus for projects and TextMate for writing, and now look at me. Look. At. Me. I’m almost a radicalized GNU fanboy who considers switching the daily driver from Mac to Arch Linux.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Xah Lee for his <a href="http://xahlee.info/emacs/">Emacs Tutorial</a> – I basically learned all my Emacs Lisp baby steps thanks to his hand-curated manual and reference with examples. I gave his modal input, <a href="http://xahlee.info/emacs/misc/xah-fly-keys.html">Xah Fly Keys</a> a try and realized what you could do with key bindings in this weird editor: the single key bindings to move by word or line, and to change the case of the word at point was a huge life-saver when proof-reading Sascha’s book draft. That got me hooked. I’m still on a old version of these bindings. Then I also got into <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/ergonomic_keyboards_index.html">mechanical split-ergo keyboards</a> thanks to his website, upgrading from my Kinesis Freestyle. And during the COVID pandemic lockdown of 2020, I had a lot of fun on <a href="https://discord.gg/8ZVbKmRAGv">his Discord</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://sachachua.com/">Sacha Chua for everything on her site</a> including cool Emacs hacks, then <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a> and <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/category/emacs-news/">Emacs News</a> as the community pulse that sucked me into the weirder things you could do with Emacs. I didn’t know about movie playback and email writing before that. Thanks for this, I guess, now I’m the “everything in Emacs” weirdo :)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since then, there have been many more. Some through packages, some through writing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://protesilaos.com/">Protesilaos Stavrou</a>, whose <code>modus-themes</code> v1 won me over and kept me loyal thanks to the deuteranopia variants.</li>
  <li>Jeremy Friesen of <a href="https://takeonrules.com/tags/emacs/">Take on Rules</a> , Mickey  Petersen of <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/">masteringemacs.org</a>, Jon Snader of <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/">irreal.org</a>, for their blogs, among many others!</li>
  <li>I, uh, ‘enjoy’ more than 200 <code>use-package</code> expressions in my init file … thanks everyone for sharing your work with the world, as free/libre software, and making Emacs better for all of us.</li>
