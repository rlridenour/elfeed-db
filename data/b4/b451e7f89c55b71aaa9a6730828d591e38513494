<p>Hong Kong has begun an official multi-day mourning period after a fire at the Wang Fuk Court residential complex in Tai Po killed at least 128 people, in one of the territory’s deadliest blazes in decades. Rescue operations at the eight-block estate, which housed more than 4,600 residents, have ended, but around 200 people remain unaccounted for as disaster victim identification teams continue to search the charred buildings. Authorities say preliminary investigations indicate the fire began on protective netting on the lower floors and spread rapidly via bamboo scaffolding and highly flammable foam insulation used during ongoing renovation works, while fire alarms in all blocks had previously failed safety tests. Hong Kong’s anti‑corruption agency and police have arrested at least 11 people, including contractors and workers, as investigators examine suspected corruption, negligence, and possible safety violations linked to the renovation and fire protection systems. The tragedy has triggered a wider review of fire safety in high‑rise buildings, with experts and officials calling for tighter regulation of construction materials and maintenance oversight across the city and mainland China.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lsYRv4D--qDcY0qg5Xb5us8ytrDxODZFPZ5AO7Q1Gr5HfKGJUK9KiiQ34kSvSzmJyneCNwnfUZpuxst9psSrRkkp5Tpm347Tj670nWEJMmjx' alt='Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee and senior officials observe a silence outside government headquarters during a ceremony mourning victims of the Wang Fuk Court fire.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Citywide mourning: The government ordered national and Hong Kong flags flown at half-mast, cancelled non-essential official events, and opened condolence books at 18 locations so residents can pay respects to the victims.</li><li>Corruption inquiry: Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption detained multiple people over alleged bribery and irregularities in the Wang Fuk Court renovation contracts, an investigation running in parallel with the criminal probe into the fire’s cause.</li><li>Construction materials focus: Experts highlight polystyrene foam boards and other combustible insulation products used on building exteriors as a central regulatory concern after preliminary findings linked such materials to the blaze&#x27;s rapid vertical spread.</li><li>Future of estate: Structural engineers say it is uncertain whether the fire-damaged towers can be safely repaired or will need full redevelopment, cautioning that any decision will involve complex liability and rehousing issues for displaced residents.</li><li>National safety plan: Authorities are working on a broader plan to reduce fire risk in high-rises, including better coordination between departments overseeing building maintenance and stricter on-site supervision of renovation works.</li></ul><blockquote>Our most heartfelt thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones and with those that are now living with shock and uncertainty. - King Charles III</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Hong Kong government: Officials described the fire as the city’s worst in nearly 80 years, declared days of mourning, and pledged a thorough investigation into the cause and any regulatory failings.
