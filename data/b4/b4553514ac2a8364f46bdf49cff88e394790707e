The first <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=iphone18">benchmark results for the A19 Pro chip</a> in the iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air surfaced in the Geekbench 6 database today.<br/>

Based on these early results — which are unconfirmed — the A19 Pro chip across the Pro models and the iPhone Air appears to deliver up to 13% to 15% faster multi-core CPU performance compared to the A18 Pro chip in the iPhone 16 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
On the graphics side, the A19 Pro offers more significant improvements. Based on <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?k=v6_compute&q=iphone18">early Metal scores</a> in the Geekbench 6 database — also unconfirmed — the full 6-core GPU variant of the chip in the iPhone 17 Pro models is up to 40% faster than the A18 Pro's 6-core GPU. In the iPhone Air, the A19 Pro chip has a reduced 5-core GPU, and one early Metal score shows it as being around 15% faster than the A18 Pro's 6-core GPU.<br/>
<br/>
In its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-unveils-iphone-17-pro-and-iphone-17-pro-max/">iPhone 17 Pro press release</a>, Apple said the A19 Pro delivers up to 40% better "sustained" performance compared to the A18 Pro:<blockquote>When paired with the Apple-designed vapor chamber, A19 Pro enables iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max to deliver up to 40 percent better sustained performance than the previous generation — ideal for gaming, video editing, and running large local language models. The 6-core CPU is the fastest CPU in any smartphone, and the 6-core GPU architecture includes Neural Accelerators built into each GPU core, a larger cache, and more memory than A18 Pro.</blockquote>It is not entirely clear if that claim refers to CPU or GPU performance.<br/>
<br/>
On its <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro product page</a>, Apple provides more realistic comparisons. There, it says the A19 Pro offers up to 20% faster CPU performance compared to the two-year-old A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models. That means the A19 Pro would offer sub-20% performance gains over the A18 Pro, so the Geekbench results showing a 13% to 15% year-over-year boost in CPU performance will likely prove to be accurate.<br/>

As always, benchmark results and real-world performance are not completely analogous.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/10/iphone-17-pro-iphone-air-a19-pro-benchmarks/">iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air Benchmarks Reveal Speed of A19 Pro Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-and-iphone-air-benchmarks-reveal-speed-of-a19-pro-chip.2465175/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
