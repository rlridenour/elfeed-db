<li>Choose between two cheap but stylish vacuums</li>
<li>Both have HEPA filtration systems and strong suction</li>
<li>Very light and easy to maneuver</li>
<li>Are they Mac compatible: Unfortunately, no; if Apple ever releases a vacuum, it’ll be a long white stick and it’ll cost eight thousand dollars</li>
</ul><h1>Good Looks, Good Price</h1><p>Why should you buy one of these vacuums?</p>
<p>Because they look cool, that’s why.</p>
<p>Okay, sorry. You should buy one of these vacuums because you need a vacuum and live in the kind of home where, for whatever reason, it just makes more sense that said vacuum is of the lightweight, cordless stick vac variety.</p>
<p>These are that. They weigh next to nothing but pack considerable power. They can run for 45 to 50 minutes on one charge (or 18 or so if you run them on turbo mode) and take 4.5 to 5 hours to charge fully. Also, they’re quiet. Also, both of them have a HEPA Filtration System so they don’t kick up a bunch of BS as you clean.</p>
<p>But let’s return to our initial point, shall we?</p>
<p>They look pretty cool, don’t they?</p>
<p>And here’s why that’s a big selling point: because you can pretend they’re fancier than they are and impress your friends.</p>
<p>You’re probably saying, “But Meh! How would we do such a thing? This is clearly a budget vacuum.” To which we would say, “<em>Clearly</em> a budget vacuum? Are you sure?”</p>
<p>Truth is, <em>you</em> know these budget vacuum cleaners because <em>you</em> see them here on Meh sporting a price tag that might not even get you a fast casual dinner for three these days. But most people know roughly 2.5 vacuum brands. Definitely Dyson, probably Hoover or Oreck or one of the old school ones, and maybe Shark.</p>
<p>They don’t know MOMAX, and that’s to your advantage. Because they probably don’t know Sebo or Miele or Riccar either.</p>
<p>So, all you have to do is say something like, “Yeah, I was thinking about the Dyson, but I ultimately decided to go with the MOMAX, price be damned!” And you don’t have to specify that the damning thing about the price is that it’s roughly two hundred bucks <em>less</em> than that of a Dyson.</p>
<p>You could even pronounce it ‘mow-mah’ or something to make it sound vaguely European!</p>
<p>Okay, this is a stupid pitch, we know.</p>
<p>But the vacuums really do look cool. So get them if you want a cool-looking (and very functional) vacuum for a stupid cheap price.</p>
