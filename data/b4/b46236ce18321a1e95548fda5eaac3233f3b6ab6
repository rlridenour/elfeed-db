Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> was in Washington, D.C. today to meet with the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Accountability Act, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/apple-s-cook-presses-us-lawmakers-over-child-online-safety-laws">Bloomberg</a></em>. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1586">App Store Accountability Act</a> would require Apple to verify a person's age when an Apple Account is created using a "commercially available method or process," and get parental consent for each app that a child under 16 downloads.<br/>

Cook conveyed to lawmakers that device-level age assurance proposals should not require the collection of sensitive data like birth certificate or social security number, and that parents should be trusted to provide the age of a child when creating a child's account. Any data used for determining age should not be kept by app stores or developers, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Cook also emphasized that age assurance efforts should focus on ensuring parents creating an account are adults, plus he suggested that parents should decide whether a child's age range  is shared with developers. <br/>
<br/>
Prior to Cook's meeting with the committee, Apple's global head of privacy, Hilary Ware sent a letter expressing Apple's concerns over the legislation. The letter said that the act "could threaten the privacy of all users by forcing millions of adults to surrender their private information for the simple act of downloading an app." Ware told lawmakers that There are better proposals that help keep kids safe without requiring millions of people to turn over their personal information," touting Apple's age assurance feature that "allows a parent to share their child’s age range with an app developer, without having to share sensitive, specific information like a birthdate or government ID."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been fighting the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Accountability Act because of its privacy concerns, and because it does not want to be legally responsible for verifying user age, obtaining parental consent, or ensuring that developers follow the rules, nor does it want to collect the required documentation. <br/>
<br/>
To head off legislation, Apple has introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/apple-child-age-verification-overhaul/">new age assurance features</a>, such as simpler tools for parents to oversee children's Apple accounts, new age categories for app content, and the Declared Age Range API that provides developers with a privacy-forward way to ensure kids aren't exposed to in-app content meant for adults.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has argued that it already has extensive parental controls with Screen Time, and that the legislation would require it to collect excessive amounts of information from all users just to verify the age of children. Apple says that it could be required to collect data like a driver's license, passport, or Social Security number, which is "not in the interest of user safety or privacy."<br/>
<br/>
The House Energy and Commerce Committee will consider the bill on Thursday morning.<br/>
<br/>
Texas <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/08/app-store-changes-texas-age-verification/">recently passed</a> a similar bill, SB2420. Starting on January 1, 2026, Apple users located in Texas will need to confirm whether they are 18 years or older when creating an Apple Account. Apple will need to verify age and parental identity, and the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will need to provide additional information to parents.<br/>
