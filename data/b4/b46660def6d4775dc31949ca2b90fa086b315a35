<p>In the latest development in Minneapolis, President Trump said the federal immigration operation in Minnesota will “de-escalate” after nationwide backlash over two fatal shootings by federal agents, including the weekend killing of 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti. Trump said he wants an “honorable” investigation into Pretti’s death, while the White House reshuffled on-the-ground leadership by putting border czar Tom Homan in charge and moving Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino out of the city. The episode has widened political pressure on the administration from some Republicans, local Minnesota leaders, and parts of the business community, even as Trump reiterated confidence in Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and promoted his economic message ahead of midterm politics.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/VfgWrWPs9UkgiZi4yuknohbi8_norkLCOQm7Wf__O1fwDg0L6NSGDvm7Nup8nP1wrjGAPhsd9RwcehoymhLMX4yGNFE_MQ6cE-9r0k2Vu9ra' alt='A federal agent fires a munition toward demonstrators near the site where Alex Pretti was fatally shot in Minneapolis, Minnesota, January 24, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tactics reset: People briefed on the White House discussions said officials considered narrowing the mission toward deportations rather than broad sweeps, reducing the federal footprint, improving coordination with state and local officials, and even requiring body-worn cameras for immigration officers.</li><li>Local outreach: Tom Homan met with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and reporting described it as an effort at detente that included plans for additional talks with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.</li><li>Protocol concerns: White House aide Stephen Miller said agents may have breached “protocol,” after earlier claims by administration figures that had labeled Pretti an “assassin” were walked back in later reporting.</li><li>Gun-rights split: Trump’s remark that Pretti should not have been carrying a gun—even though he was legally armed under Minnesota law—put him at odds with some Republicans and gun-rights advocates who criticized blaming a lawful gun owner in a fatal encounter.</li><li>Corporate dissent: Some prominent tech leaders, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Apple CEO Tim Cook, joined calls for restraint and accountability, while other top Silicon Valley CEOs remained publicly quiet, reflecting a divided response in the sector.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Trump said the Minnesota operation will “de-escalate a little bit,” described Pretti’s killing as “very sad,” and said he still has confidence in Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
