Apple's software engineers are testing iOS 18.6.2, according to the <em>MacRumors</em> visitor logs, which have been a reliable indicator of upcoming iOS versions.<br/>

Yesterday, an anonymous source with a proven track record <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/another-ios-18-update-is-in-the-pipeline/">said iOS 18.6.2 was incoming</a>, but the update was not present in our logs at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, the same anonymous source claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-preparing-ios-17-5-2/">iOS 17.5.2 was in the pipeline</a>, but Apple ended up releasing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-releases-ipados-17-5-1-ipad-10/">revised iOS 17.5.1 build for the iPad 10</a>. Accordingly, the source said it was possible that iOS 18.6.2 might end up being a revised build of iOS 18.6.1, but our logs suggest that Apple is indeed planning to release iOS 18.6.2.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.6.2 will likely include bug fixes and/or security patches, and perhaps some additional enhancements to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/blood-oxygen-monitoring-returning-to-apple-watch/">redesigned Blood Oxygen feature</a> introduced on select Apple Watch models in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/apple-releases-ios-18-6-1/">with iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1</a> last week. The update will have a build number of 22G100, according to the anonymous source.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.6.1's build number is 22G90.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.6.2 should be released soon — likely this week or next week — given that evidence of the update is now showing up in multiple places.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/19/ios-18-6-2-coming-soon/">iOS 18.6.2 Update Coming Soon for iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-6-2-update-coming-soon-for-iphones.2463638/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
