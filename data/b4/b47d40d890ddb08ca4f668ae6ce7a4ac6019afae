<blockquote>
  <p>The new 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M5 chip does not include a
charger in the box in European countries, including the U.K.,
Ireland, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway,
and others, according to Apple’s online store. In the U.S. and all
other countries outside of Europe, the new MacBook Pro comes with
Apple’s 70W USB-C Power Adapter, but European customers miss out.</p>

<p>Apple has gradually stopped including chargers with many products
over the years — a decision it has attributed to its
environmental goals.</p>

<p>In this case, an Apple spokesperson <a href="https://x.com/LelloucheNico/status/1978510945224688060">told French website
Numerama’s Nicolas Lellouche</a> that the decision to not
include a charger with this particular MacBook Pro was made in
anticipation of a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202402997">European regulation</a> that will require
Apple to provide customers with the option to purchase certain
devices without a charger in the box, starting in April.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure why there’s no power adapter in the box in the UK (<a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-black-standard-display-apple-m5-chip-with-10-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-16gb-memory-512gb">I double-checked</a>). The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C_202402997">cited regulation</a> is for the EU, and the UK, rather famously, left the EU in 2020.</p>

<p>But, still, amazing stuff <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/08/apple-france-siri-opt-in-recordings">continues</a> to happen in Europe.</p>
