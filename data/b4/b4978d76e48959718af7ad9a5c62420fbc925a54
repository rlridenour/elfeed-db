First, a new Flashback Capture feature lets you recover a performance that otherwise may have been lost because you forgot to set Logic Pro to record.<br/>
<br/>
Next, there are enhancements to the Stem Splitter feature that allows you to extract stems from an audio track for vocals, bass, drums, and other instrumental parts. With today's update, Apple says Stem Splitter now supports guitar and piano, and the feature now offers even greater audio fidelity. Stem Splitter requires a Mac with an M1 chip or newer, or an iPad with an A12 Bionic chip or newer running iPadOS 18.4 or later.<br/>
<br/>
The new version of Logic Pro also includes a new Dancefloor Rush sound pack for the Mac and iPad, offering drum-and-bass sounds with over 400 dynamic loops and punchy drum kits. Two more sound packs added to the Mac app include Magnetic Imperfections with analog tape sounds, and Tosin Abasi with progressive metal guitar sounds.<br/>
<br/>
On the Mac, Logic Pro's built-in notepad now supports Apple Intelligence's Writing Tools.<br/>
