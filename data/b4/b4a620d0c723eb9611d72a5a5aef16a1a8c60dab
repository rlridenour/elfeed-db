<p>The initiative aims to promote environmental sustainability in academic philosophy by way of a network of organizers. There are MAP chapters in many departments of philosophy, and the idea is to have at least one &#8220;climate ambassador&#8221; in each chapter.</p>
<p>J.C. Ward (Wake Forest), one of MAP&#8217;s co-directors, share the following information about it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The ambassadors will have the opportunity to collaborate and to attend and organize events focused on strategies for advocating for sustainability. They will be expected to share what they have learned with their own MAP chapters and department. For example, ambassadors might attend one of the Philosophers for Sustainability virtual workshops on the APA Good Practices Guide as it relates to sustainability. Following the event, ambassadors could put on similar workshops on their campus and/or region. There are many ways to participate. We expect that this will be a dynamic group that has a significant impact on the field of philosophy.</em></p>
<p>They are looking for volunteers to become Climate Ambassadors.
