<h3 id="but-i-didnt-win">But I didn&rsquo;t win!</h3>

<p>If you didn&rsquo;t win, sorry, but <a href="https://cleanshot.com/">CleanShot X is still worth checking out</a>. This is hands down the best screenshot app there is for Mac. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.</p>

<p>By the way, CleanShot X is also available on <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a>, along with hundreds of other amazing apps. You should probably <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">get a subscription</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added one more app to the giveaway list: <a href="https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/mac/">Yoink</a>. Check back every Monday through April, 2025 for more giveaways.</p>

<p>If you want to suggest an app you&rsquo;d like to see in this series, let me know on <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/contact/">via email</a> or on <a href="https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff/">Mastodon</a>, and <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/subscribe/">join the email</a> list for notifications!</p>
