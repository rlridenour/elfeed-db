<p>Emacs ships with a perfectly functional world clock, available via <code>M-x world-clock</code>. Having said that, there are two things I wish it had:</p>
<ol>
<li>A quick way to interactively add any city (bonus points for fuzzy search).</li>
<li>An easy way to shift the time back and forth.</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I can tell, these are neither available nor possible on the built-in <code>world-clock</code> (please correct me if otherwise), so when my friend across the world recently asked me for the best time to meet, I knew this was the last nudge I needed to get this done.</p>
<p>With that, I give you <code>M-x time-zones</code> (now on <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/time-zones">GitHub</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-time-zones-mode/time-zones.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There isn't much to talk about other than <code>time-zones</code> accomplishes the above tasks very easily without resorting to writing elisp nor accessing via customize, which I seldom use.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, <code>time-zones</code> is on <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/time-zones">GitHub</a> if you'd like to give it a spin. It's super fresh, so please report any issues. Hope you like it.</p>
