<p>Blogging is one of those things I want to do more of when I don&rsquo;t have the time, and when I do have the time, I don&rsquo;t want to. The reason for that, I think, is my internal steam valve.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m bogged down with work and the day seems like a conveyor belt of meetings with just enough breaks between to squeeze in a reminder for yet another high-priority project, I need to let some of the pressure off. For me, it usually means going to do something else. If I&rsquo;m working from home, I go to the kitchen to clean up and do dishes. If I&rsquo;m at the office, I go out for a short walk and grab a snack or say hello to someone I haven&rsquo;t seen in a while.</p>
<p>I need these few minutes away from the screen to remind myself I still have a pair of legs, eyeballs that would appreciate seeing things that are more than 20 inches away from my face, and most importantly, a brain that needs to stop trying to figure out how to make sense out of everything and just be. This also means no blogging.</p>
<p>Ideally though, that would be the best time to do so: a couple of minutes to look through my RSS feeds or my saved articles to read and come up with something, or just <a href="https://taonaw.com/2024/08/10/on-this-day.html">attend to my blog</a>. But we&rsquo;ll get back to that in a minute. Let&rsquo;s talk about Jack for a second.</p>
<p>Jack seems to be in a bit of a rut recently. I can&rsquo;t find the post now (it&rsquo;s a bit challenging to follow everything the guy says everywhere), but he was talking about taking a break. Then, for his <a href="https://baty.net/posts/2025/08/25-years-of-blogging/">25th blog anniversary</a>, he said he thought about shutting down his website as a present to himself. That hit somewhere under the surface for me and made a little splash. So I went to wash some dishes. Here I was, trying to figure out how to find the time (and mostly the mental energy) to blog more, and this guy is like, &ldquo;My blog has become a simple journal. It doesn’t mean anything. I write about what I’m thinking or what I feel like sharing. That’s it&hellip; Some days I love doing it. Other days I wonder why I bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What do you <em>mean</em> why do you bother?? It&rsquo;s Blogging Jack! It&rsquo;s the cornerstone of grumpy farts like us who&hellip; don&rsquo;t know why&hellip; they even&hellip; bother&hellip;.?  Thanksalot, man! Ughh!</p>
<p>Back to me and my blogging is a steam valve. I have another release that I use often and frequently, a very close second to blogging: my <a href="https://taonaw.com/archive/?q=journelly">journal</a>. With years of writing, my blogging voice is not much different than my journal one. It&rsquo;s a slow process, but I do have more posts today on the blog that came straight out of my journal. Sure, the separation is still important; some things are just not meant for public eyes, while others are so half-assed written and riddled with typos I actually go back and edit those (yes, in my own journal, I want to be able to read it in the future if I can). But the point is, there&rsquo;s almost not a single day these days there isn&rsquo;t <em>something</em> written down. I guess that means there&rsquo;s a lot of steam building up. And that, apparently, is not a bad thing - if I attend to it the ways I mentioned.</p>
<p>We humans have a lot of thoughts. It&rsquo;s only when we wind down and relax that we can slow down enough to process them in a linear way that allows coherent ideas. Most of the time, there&rsquo;s so much going on upstairs that we can&rsquo;t connect the pieces. It&rsquo;s like chasing dry leaves in the wind. Writing things down slows us down enough to process, which in turn leads to &ldquo;ah ha!&rdquo; moments, which is why everyone you&rsquo;d ask (including your therapist probably) would tell you to keep some form of a journal, especially if you need to think things over.</p>
<p>Blogging is how we reach out for opinions. When I write in my blog, I write in my public voice, the one that is open to criticism and asking for feedback. It&rsquo;s me saying, &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ve been having these thoughts, what do you make of it?&rdquo; This is why blogging and journaling are closely related. If you think, you can journal. If you can journal, you can blog. You don&rsquo;t have to be crazy like me and go through all sorts of internal filters (but you probably do anyway) and edit your own journal entries; you can just let them out. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. I mean, have you <em>seen</em> what&rsquo;s on the internet lately? And you&rsquo;re worried about offending someone with your thoughts?</p>
<p>So, we live and we work, we have a lot going on, we need a break to slow down, we process, we write, we blog, and we invite people to start a conversation with us. One of the things I found myself doing recently is sending links to my posts to my friends/partners/family. That&rsquo;s because I have an idea processed already, a conversation I want to have, and it&rsquo;s just easy to &ldquo;here, what do you think of this,&rdquo; instead of starting to type it all up again in a chat. It&rsquo;s even typo-free. Mostly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how to be able to write more and when, but I know I want to. There&rsquo;s just so much stuff. And in a way, yeah, it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. I don&rsquo;t think bothering with a meaning is helpful for anything on a blog. I&rsquo;m not here trying to sell you on something (besides blogging in itself maybe, fine&hellip;) or get a point across to you, I&rsquo;m just chatting.</p>
