<p>Japan says Chinese J-15 fighter jets directed fire-control radar at its F-15J aircraft during two encounters over international waters southeast of Okinawa on Saturday, calling the moves dangerous and summoning China’s ambassador in protest. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi described the radar illumination as going beyond what is needed for safe flight, and ordered strengthened surveillance of surrounding airspace and seas while promising a calm but firm response. China rejects Japan’s account, accusing Japanese planes of repeatedly approaching and harassing a Chinese navy carrier group that was conducting previously announced drills near the Miyako Strait northeast of Taiwan, and has lodged its own counter‑protests. The confrontation comes amid already strained ties over Taiwan, with Beijing criticizing recent comments by Takaichi that a Chinese use of force against the self-governed island could trigger a Japanese security response under domestic law.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/HPgOPjEGDWzifXjnUH3yciFsru31UdAPPHxw-LPJ9Qk6bT_4MyiPCUXPyHrCjlxG00EbxnJuhSnaYoE62bAtaKfhKW5Jahrz8uVcZ02HrlYJkRSBXVfKUgy9ulVgoiuElNkm4oeSXPGfZFUjlEHCSUCazvffGLqKPxPzCTQR8sipWtZpuLLgDnY-2YAwUi5RQmDUDY_u' alt='China’s aircraft carrier Liaoning sailing near Okinawa during an earlier deployment, highlighting the busy air and sea corridors where Japanese and Chinese forces now operate in close proximity.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Diplomatic steps: Japan’s foreign ministry summoned China’s ambassador in Tokyo on Sunday to formally object to the radar incidents, while Beijing says it has issued its own diplomatic protests against what it calls Japan’s false narrative and provocative behavior.</li><li>Location details: Japanese officials say the encounters occurred above international waters to the southeast of Okinawa, close to key sea lanes linking the East China Sea and the wider Pacific, an area where both countries’ forces train and transit regularly.</li><li>Chinese exercises: China states its aircraft were supporting previously announced carrier exercises in the western Pacific, part of broader naval drills that included the carrier Liaoning operating near Japan’s southwestern islands.</li><li>Escalating rhetoric: Chinese foreign ministry and navy spokespeople accuse Japan of spreading and hyping up false security information for &#x27;ulterior motives&#x27;, while Japanese leaders label the alleged radar locks &#x27;extremely regrettable&#x27; and warn they raise the risk of accidents.</li><li>Regional context: Analysts note that the incident unfolds as Japan deepens security cooperation with partners like the United States around Taiwan and the East China Sea, a trend Beijing views with concern amid its own regular military activities in the same region.</li></ul><blockquote>These radar illuminations are a dangerous act that went beyond what is necessary for the safe flight of aircraft - Sanae Takaichi, prime minister of Japan</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Japan: Tokyo argues that Chinese fighter jets twice trained fire-control radar on Japanese F-15s in international airspace, calls the action unsafe, and says it will boost maritime and airspace surveillance while responding &#x27;calmly and resolutely&#x27;.
