</ul><h1>Ride On</h1><p>Last time we sold this, <a href="/@goldnectar">@goldnectar</a> asked for some guidance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone convince me why, as a mid 40s man, I don’t need this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which <a href="/@Jonas4321">@Jonas4321</a> responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can easily ride a skateboard, a unicycle, a wakeboard AND a slalom waterski, I can’t convince you not to get this. However, if any or all of these present a challenge to you, remember that the ground you ride these on is really, REALLY hard, and your first bodily point of impact when this flies out from under you will either be an easily fractured wrist or your coccyx, neither of which are easily protected by gear. Yes, this is experience talking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we don’t mean this to be discouraging. We only want to highlight a very important point: just because these can move without any pedaling or pushing off the ground doesn’t mean they can be operated without any skill. You still need decent balance.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you follow <a href="/@PooltoyWolf">@PooltoyWolf</a>’s advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These things are super fun with a go-kart attachment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/@doubltap">@doubltap</a> confirms this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…it’s really cool to ride around on! Plus, with the go-kart attachment you don’t have to worry about falling off and busting your ass!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, maybe a bit less balance required with the go-kart attachment. (But also, probably still <em>some</em> balance required.)</p>
<p>Oh, and if you’re like, “WTF is a go-kart attachment?!” <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=hover-1+go+kart+attachment&crid=P28VYSFI4T2N&sprefix=hover-1+go+kart+attachment%2Caps%2C231&ref=nb_sb_noss_2&tag=mehdown-20">It’s one of these</a>. (Though, I’ll add, I’d never heard of this before and just searched Amazon for “hover-1 go kart attachment” so if you decide to get one, do your due diligence to make sure it’s compatible.)</p>
<p>In conclusion: if you have good balance (or want to add a go-kart attachment) we give you our permission to purchase this hoverboard. And if you don’t, we still give you our permission. Just don’t send us the medical bill.</p>
