<p>Kalley Huang and Erin Woo, reporting for The Information (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3ln2ngxzqn22l">via Ed Zitron</a>, who summarized it on Bluesky):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meta Platforms over the past year asked Microsoft, Amazon and
others to help pay the costs of training Meta’s flagship large
language model, Llama, according to four people briefed on the
discussions. Meta’s overtures reflected worries about the growing
costs of its artificial intelligence development, according to two
of the people. [...]</p>

<p>Meta in particular has faced questions about the business logic
behind its AI development, given that Llama is open-source
software, freely available for anyone’s use. That makes it
difficult to turn into a business. And Meta makes money primarily
from advertising and has little experience in selling business
software.</p>

<p>While Meta held its most serious discussions with Amazon and
Microsoft, it has also discussed the idea with Databricks, IBM and
Oracle, as well as representatives from at least one Middle
Eastern investor, according to two of the people briefed on the
discussions. Meta was still in discussions with companies about
the Llama Consortium as recently as the start of this year, the
two people said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“<em>Would you consider throwing a few sacks full of</em> your <em>cash on this bonfire of</em> our <em>cash that we’ve been burning?</em>” is a hell of a pitch.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In its discussions with other companies, Meta primarily asked for
money. It also sought servers or other resources that would offset
the cost of training its models, according to two of the people
briefed on the discussions. In return for their assistance, Meta
discussed offering other companies promotion of their services
alongside Llama — for example, a Meta executive might appear at a
conference hosted by a consortium partner — or providing more
insight into the training process for the model, one of those
people said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pay a little and a Meta representative will show up at your developer conference. Pay more and a Meta rep <em>won’t</em> show up at your developer conference.</p>
