<p>Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a federal royal commission to examine antisemitism and social cohesion in the wake of the Bondi Beach mass shooting, which authorities have described as a terrorist attack. The inquiry will be led by former High Court judge Virginia Bell and will also look at the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attack and how law enforcement responds to antisemitism. The move follows sustained calls for a national inquiry, including pressure from parts of Australia’s Jewish community, and represents a shift from Albanese’s earlier resistance to a broad inquiry.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/_AL7xXIbrDO3jYM3ueLW9jDpWRhBAhshId03MgnDl8Y1-QJBj50xtJ2Uq46eNNIrFUIJqfVMJ3BN6fZkIwRU2UMeGs-LmETyisulAkAq1w5iIkMKUxkhzwDgu_YfrnVX_0D558HxgAgngnu_04A9i-hFrkbRP01jjvPtbfjPGAzUqlsPB2-PbpPQGEGJCDZnns2xmLzcBZaIiJx4lpZhlJHSDHfIHxeSSkJuR1-4CgmRwr6HX2rDwlr26A' alt='Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at a press conference announcing a royal commission into antisemitism and social cohesion.
