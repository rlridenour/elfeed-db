Germany is evaluating Apple's proposed changes to address antitrust concerns over App Tracking Transparency (ATT), reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/german-antitrust-authority-tests-apples-revised-app-tracking-rules-competition-2025-12-02/">Reuters</a></em>. Apple plans to tweak the text and formatting of the ATT consent prompt, while aiming to preserve the main privacy benefits of the feature.<br/>

Apple will add neutral consent prompts for its own services and for third-party apps, aligning the wording, content, and visual design of the messages. Apple also plans to simplify the consent process to make it easier for developers to get user permission for ad-related data processing.<br/>
<br/>
Germany is asking for feedback from publishers, media groups, and regulators to determine if Apple's changes will address complaints about the limited amount of user data available to app publishers.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/23/apple-app-tracking-transparency-europe/">Earlier this year</a>, Apple said that it might have to remove ATT from the EU. "Intense lobbying efforts in Germany, Italy and other countries in Europe may force us to withdraw this feature to the detriment of European consumers," Apple said.<br/>
<br/>
Germany first launched a probe into App Tracking Transparency in 2022 after complaints from advertisers, and in February 2025, the German Federal Cartel Office preliminarily decided that Apple abused its market power, giving itself preferential treatment. According to German regulators, Apple's restrictions made it "far more difficult" for developers to access user data relevant for advertising.<br/>
<br/>
Introduced in 2021, App Tracking Transparency lets <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users decide whether to allow apps to track their activity across other apps and websites for advertising purposes. Users can choose to allow apps to ask for permission, or turn off tracking entirely.<br/>
<br/>
ATT prevents apps from accessing the advertising identifier of Apple devices without express consumer permission, so apps can't track what users do and use that data for ad targeting. ATT has been unpopular with advertisers and data brokers, but Apple has pledged to work to convince Germany and other EU countries to allow it to continue to offer ATT to consumers.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/">App Tracking Transparency</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/germany/">Germany</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/germany-app-tracking-transparency/">Germany Considering Apple&#039;s App Tracking Transparency Changes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/germany-considering-apples-app-tracking-transparency-changes.2473976/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
