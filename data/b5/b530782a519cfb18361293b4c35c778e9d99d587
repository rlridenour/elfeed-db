It is not immediately clear what new features or changes are included in the new firmware, but we'll update this article should we find out. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware-7e508a/">been beta testing</a> the updated firmware since late January.<br/>
<br/>
Firmware updates <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/airpods-firmware-update-instructions/">can be installed</a> by putting the AirPods in Bluetooth range of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi, and then plugging them in to charge. It can take up to 30 minutes for firmware to update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your firmware version by going to Settings > Bluetooth and selecting the Info button next to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; when they are connected to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, or Mac.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-releases-airpods-firmware-7e93/">Apple Releases New Firmware for AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-firmware-for-airpods-pro-2-and-airpods-4.2454386/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
