<p>President Trump said the United States needs to “own” Greenland and warned the U.S. would act “whether they like it or not,” framing the island as vital to U.S. security in the Arctic and arguing that Russia or China could otherwise gain control there. Denmark, which has sovereignty over Greenland, rejected the idea that the territory is for sale, while Greenland’s elected leaders publicly emphasized that their future should be decided by Greenlanders. The remarks have added strain inside NATO because both the U.S. and Denmark are members, and European officials are weighing how to respond diplomatically.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/pMyq32HhLFOK_OgjKIR5JvGDEyVzZT3Jv19YVj9jahA4Ds7s3DSr2owyOg1qxqkKMrCCqoX_hGCx1sKkywgE9K128gVTWhgRbMPNcnpACGN1CqF5AWEFmcajhbM0OTXHSkXUsQX9H2KHSRjyDag5gkN-IrkHZzL4PImmrrivRll1tnqeZMOOr8EVigD0DvZTqqmeOr78vGaPMpPd' alt='Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, as Europe weighs how to respond.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Existing US role: The U.S. already operates in Greenland under a 1951 agreement that allows a U.S. military presence on the island, a point cited by critics who argue existing arrangements already cover defense cooperation.</li><li>Greenland unity: All five parties in Greenland’s parliament, Inatsisartut, issued a joint statement rejecting U.S. claims and calling on Washington to end what they described as “disdain for our country”.</li><li>Denmark warning: Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that an armed attack by the U.S. against another NATO country would mean “everything stops,” underscoring the alliance stakes of the dispute.</li><li>Europe’s approach: European officials were described as stunned that President Trump restated his Greenland ambitions after a yearlong effort to dissuade him, and some see negotiation as the best available path to reduce escalation.</li><li>NATO dilemma: Analysts quoted in Spanish daily El País argued that military action against Greenland could create an existential crisis for NATO by pitting a major ally against a smaller member state’s territory.</li></ul><blockquote>We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders - Greenland parliament parties (joint statement)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump and the White House: The U.S. should acquire Greenland for national security, with the president saying Washington will act “the easy way” or “the hard way” to prevent Russia or China gaining a foothold in the Arctic.
