<p>Australia said its ambassador to the United States, former prime minister Kevin Rudd, will leave the Washington post earlier than expected and finish up at the end of March. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese presented the change as orderly and said the US-Australia alliance would remain close, while reports noted the decision follows criticism and visible friction with President Trump. Rudd is slated to move into a new role leading the Asia Society and its China-focused analysis work, shifting him from day-to-day diplomacy to longer-term regional policy research.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SzrkYE-OySdgWBi635cWcliEklA9uavvp4udQCN_OBQpBjoIQ9NHkm4a2bkq1WipWinBUPo1J9q2h4G2YAmP01dAaLAYyVFIaXB7Un6ghhw0mgA0V3srvh-pzcBDGAm_z3H8r3egXdKKIR9uJznDyac2YaUMY3Uo9vu51Kl8I9-OKYFDECXMEHkL0U6PfaHZeIpBQch63-O-ijFsqod_g3hRfE234vw78v0We8aB6KtI9tFWyeK4FnApPw' alt='Kevin Rudd has left the bilateral relationship between the United States and Australia in good shape.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Next role: Albanese said Rudd will become global president of the Asia Society and lead its Centre for China Analysis after leaving the ambassador role.</li><li>Policy wins: Foreign Minister Penny Wong credited Rudd with helping advance the AUKUS security partnership and supporting progress on a US-Australia critical minerals arrangement.</li><li>Domestic politics: The Hindu reported Australia’s opposition had called for Rudd’s posting to end after President Trump expressed disdain for him during a televised White House meeting in October.</li><li>Bigger backdrop: ABC noted Rudd departs amid a changing strategic environment, with President Trump expected to make his first presidential visit to China in almost 10 years about a month after Rudd leaves office.</li></ul><blockquote>Australia and the ⁠United States are the closest of friends and allies, and this will never change - Anthony Albanese</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese: He announced Rudd will finish in March and said the US-Australia alliance remains enduring.
