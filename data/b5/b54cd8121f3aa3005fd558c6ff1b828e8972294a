<p>Denmark, the United States and Greenland have begun senior-level technical talks in Washington on a possible “framework” arrangement tied to Greenland and Arctic security, with Danish officials describing the first meeting as “very constructive” and expressing increased optimism about the dialogue. The discussions are framed as a way to address President Trump’s push for a bigger U.S. role on the strategically located Arctic island while stopping short of any transfer of sovereignty, which Denmark and Greenland say is not on the table. Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen have emphasized that cooperation can expand in areas like security, but they also stress “red lines” and democratic principles, with sovereignty described as non-negotiable. As the diplomatic effort widens, Denmark’s King Frederik is set to visit Greenland in February, while reporting from Greenland highlights Inuit views that the land is shared rather than owned—adding an on-the-ground perspective to a debate often discussed in strategic terms.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/BIIdOp0ipyU4P-2-1whFsynRKowzSlr6-3Xt_8fGf1Ix-RS8f_F_nuefuac4xHNaevOs_zPxbbxyE9pKVoePvmlum2-mi1y669VllHT6EGwNyP1Q95td-kwZncSqb4lWZasXk-bTYN7dchexdLgX_h_tna86q0j84tWYwCSL7ARLHwaN7mN6SAmCofGh4ZfmA-2xEsQX6Q8WoKykI6bEzL_aEFbYO05d0HC-HH7ywN8JQkvzIj9GbNpRaDJga5SH20zapR-aOQ' alt='Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, French President Emmanuel Macron and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen meet in Paris on January 28, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>EU consultations: Frederiksen’s stops in Berlin and Paris—including a lunch at the Élysée with President Emmanuel Macron and Greenland’s Nielsen—were presented as part of coordinating European thinking after Trump’s Greenland threats.</li><li>Diplomatic cables: U.S. State Department cables obtained by POLITICO describe allies’ concerns about the Greenland dispute spilling into trade tensions and broader transatlantic strains, with Finland’s foreign minister urging, “Let’s not get a divorce”.</li><li>China’s view: A U.S. Embassy Beijing cable cited in POLITICO says Chinese officials and analysts saw Trump’s Greenland push as a chance to encourage “European hedging” and amplify transatlantic frictions.</li><li>Royal visit: Denmark’s King Frederik announced a Greenland trip for February 18–20 as Denmark underscores its position that the Arctic island remains within the Danish realm.</li><li>Inuit perspective: Reporting from Kapisillit describes Inuit residents rejecting the idea of a purchasable territory, saying the Arctic land is shared rather than owned.</li></ul><blockquote>Let’s not get a divorce - Elina Valtonen</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Danish government: Denmark describes the initial senior-official meeting in Washington as “very constructive” and signals optimism about continued talks.
