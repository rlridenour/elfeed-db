<p>when is it too much? When is the line crossed where the entertainment stops being worth the commercials?</p>

<p>Good question. As a person who never cared for Football, the NFL commercial craziness never bugged me. But I hate commercials in general. My threshold is always between low and very low.  Whenever a commercial comes up, I usually just quit on the movie/show (or the streamer if I&rsquo;m watching Twitch) as soon as they come on.</p>
