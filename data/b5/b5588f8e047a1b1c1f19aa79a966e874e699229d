Apple is expected to win the rights to stream Formula 1 races on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ in the United States thanks to a &#36;150 million bid, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-f1-streaming-bidding-rights-espn-movie-2025-7"><em>Business Insider</em></a> reports.<br/>

The rights to broadcast Formula 1 in the United States are currently held by Disney's ESPN. According to sources familiar with the negotiations, Disney is apparently unwilling to match or beat Apple's offer. It pays around &#36;85 million per year for its current rights, just over half of Apple's latest bid.<br/>
<br/>
Interest from other suitors, such as Netflix, was also reportedly "muted," leaving Apple as the leading bidder for the U.S. rights to show the races. As a result, Apple is likely to have another sport to stream on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ next year, alongside Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer.<br/>

Apple's move to gain the rights to stream Formula comes amid the success of "F1: The Movie," which is Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/06/gamble-on-f1-starting-to-pay-off/">first major box office hit</a>, earning over &#36;300 million globally already. It is expected to become available on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ later in 2025.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/businessinsider-com/">Business Insider</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/14/apple-expected-to-win-rights-to-f1/">Apple Expected to Win Rights to Formula 1 With &#36;150M Bid</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expected-to-win-rights-to-formula-1-with-150m-bid.2461507/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
