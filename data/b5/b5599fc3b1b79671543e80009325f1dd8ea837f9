<p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told lawmakers he visited Jeffrey Epstein’s private Caribbean island, Little Saint James, for lunch in 2012, while pushing back on suggestions that he had a closer relationship with Epstein. The acknowledgement drew fresh scrutiny because it conflicts with Lutnick’s earlier claims that he had ended ties with Epstein years earlier. The admission came up during Senate questioning tied to Justice Department documents referenced at the hearing, and against a wider political debate over accountability connected to what several outlets describe as the “Epstein files”. Lawmakers, including from both parties, have called for Lutnick to resign, while President Trump has publicly backed him.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/2t9_wYCiJltjogNijxNLEeZsnRsP6qgF4sODgHPjRBxP72HN-ZWhYy1lnbNCwWiWNK6914QkJlZDdU_HygLPaVP1c1Rp63Uby74V0-WSf0Q4O7HcvxbHwo_2Elt1Z35N63ZXB0lRDR9wA8gbUsE7s7bs6ROSxgmVT6Dlzazy8-k7vhwyYk9EGbqqycQh8BH9Otyv9fYNb5lCZmsIZGpsXjhUt3uSaffhTBZ3GgPP5mr_L3pafzV2lixvVGXX_FqXjtPqifn3KiBACA' alt='US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick appears during coverage of Senate questioning over contacts with Jeffrey Epstein.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Hearing trigger: Lutnick confirmed the visit during Senate questioning after Justice Department documents cited at the hearing showed he had planned a trip to Epstein’s island, prompting him to address it directly.</li><li>Specific inconsistency: The 2012 island lunch clashes with Lutnick’s earlier public timeline, including past claims that he had cut ties with Epstein in 2005.</li><li>How Lutnick framed it: He described the trip as a lunch visit and said it did not reflect a close relationship, telling reporters he had “nothing to hide”.</li><li>Political fallout: The disclosure renewed calls for his resignation from lawmakers, even as President Trump continued to signal support.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Howard Lutnick: He told a Senate panel he went to Little Saint James for lunch in 2012 and played down the idea that he had a close relationship with Epstein.
