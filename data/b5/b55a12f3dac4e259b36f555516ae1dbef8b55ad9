Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-enhances-boarding-passes/">added</a> several new features for boarding passes in iOS 26. Previewed at WWDC in June, the features include Live Activities for tracking flights directly from the Lock Screen, airport terminal maps, and Find My integration for luggage tracking.<br/>
<br/>
According to the report's tipster, users must manually enable the Live Activity through the Wallet app – it doesn't activate automatically. Also, when a user shares flight status with others, they see the Live Activity, minus boarding group and seat information.<br/>
<br/>
United joins a growing list of airlines that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/11/apple-wallet-enhanced-boarding-pass-airlines/">says</a> is planning to adopt the feature. Others include Air Canada, American Airlines, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, Lufthansa, Qantas, and Virgin Australia.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/">Apple Wallet</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/06/apple-wallet-new-boarding-pass-united-airlines/">Apple Wallet&#039;s New Boarding Passes Now Supported by United Airlines</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wallets-new-boarding-passes-now-supported-by-united-airlines.2468499/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
