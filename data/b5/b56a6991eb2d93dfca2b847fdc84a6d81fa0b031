JTR over at <a href="https://taonaw.com">The Art Of Not Asking Why</a> has a post discussing his current scheme <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/11/14/handling-project-in-emacs-the.html">for handling projects in Emacs</a>. It&rsquo;s a post that discusses the problem that many of have with integrating our Org files across all our devices. JTR, like me, lives in the Apple ecosystem and needs a way of interacting with his Org files from his iPhone and iPad. The situation isn&rsquo;t any better in the Android world.

For various reasons, JTR has stopped using iCloud for his syncing. I&rsquo;m sympathetic to his complaints but doubt that any other solution would be an improvement. Servers go down and there are network problems. This happens regardless of what cloud solution you&rsquo;re using. If you&rsquo;re fortunate to work from home, you can, of course, arrange to do everything locally, which avoids many of the cloud problems.

<p>
Given these realities, JTR has settled on some procedures to ease his workflow. Oddly, most of them don&rsquo;t involve the networking aspects of his workflow. Rather, he restructured how he arranges his Org files and made all his workflows project oriented. You can read the details in his post and judge whether or not they&rsquo;ll work for you.

The takeaway is that trying to spread access to your Org files—or more generally, your Emacs files—across all your devices is a difficult problem for which there isn&rsquo;t a compelling solution. <a href="https://www.beorgapp.com/">Beorg</a> or <a href="https://xenodium.com/plain-org-for-ios">Plain Org</a> are nice apps that can help in the Apple domain and there are others for Android but they&rsquo;re not the same as being in Emacs. In the end, you may have to adjust your Emacs use in some way as JTR did.</p>
