Programming drew the idea of functions from math. Consistent with that heritage, pure functions operate purely in terms of the values they receive and the value(s) they produce. While every programming language relies upon functions to some degree, one of the trademarks of languages called &ldquo;functional&rdquo; is that they model program-flow as the passage and transformation of data from beginning to end. Though style-neutral, Javascript allows designers to implement functional design if they so choose.
