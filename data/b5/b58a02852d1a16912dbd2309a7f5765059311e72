<h2>4.7.0 on 2025-04-17</h2>

<p>This release introduces many subtle stylistic tweaks to the “tinted”,
“deuteranopia”, and “tritanopia” theme variants.</p>

<h3>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-list-colors</code> command uses a tabulated list</h3>

<p>This command and its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-list-colors-current</code> variant help
users see the colour values and semantic palette mappings defined by
the given theme. In the past, their buffer was designed in the same
spirit as that of the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list-faces-display</code>, whereas now it is
like the buffer of the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list-packages</code>. Concretely, users may
now sort by column. Do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x describe-mode</code> while in that buffer to
learn about the available commands and their respective key bindings.</p>

<h3>The “tinted” themes have slightly different colours</h3>

<p>The overall feel of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-operandi-tinted</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-vivendi-tinted</code>
themes is the same as before. Though in a side-by-side comparison between the
old and new versions reveals lots of subtle differences. The general
idea is to make the themes a bit more consistent by tweaking the
foreground values to be more harmonious in combination with their
background.</p>

<h3>The “deuteranopia” themes are more consistently blue and yellow</h3>

<p>These are the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-operandi-deuteranopia</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-vivendi-deuteranopia</code>,
which are optimised for users with red-green colour deficiency. In the
past, these themes used blue and yellow hues wherever a concept of
“success” versus “failure” had to be established. This approach is
more generalised now, to include programming syntax highlighting and
many other contexts. In short, the themes are more blue+yellow, while
retaining their original feel.</p>

<h3>The “tritanopia” themes are more consistently red and cyan</h3>

<p>As above, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-operandi-tritanopia</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-vivendi-tritanopia</code>
themes, which are optimised for users with blue-yellow colour deficiency,
use a red+cyan palette in more places. Overall, they feel like they
did before, only they are more consistent.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Extended support for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">icomplete</code> faces that are coming in Emacs
version 31.</p>
  </li>

    <p>Added support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">treemacs</code> faces, courtesy of Rahul Juliato in

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tldr</code> package.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extended support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adoc-mode</code>. Thanks to Leilei332 for the
contribution in pull request 137: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/pull/137">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/pull/137</a>.
The change is within the ~15-line limit, meaning that the author
does not need to assign copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spacious-padding</code> package, specifically the
faces it can use when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spacious-padding-subtle-mode-line</code> user
option is enabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howm</code> package.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extended support to the new faces of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transient</code> package. More
specifically, all those faces use the same colour for key bindings
because the idea of colour coding keys (e.g. light yellow means
something different than dark blue) does not work in practice when
considering accessibility. Such semantics should not be limited to
differences in colour: they should also have distinct indicators,
such as ASCII or Unicode characters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Revised the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">avy</code> package’s faces to only use one coloured
background. The multiple coloured backgrounds have been a perennial
problem for our accessibility requirements and have made the themes
needlessly more complex just to support an edge case. With this
simplified style, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">avy</code> continues to work fine: it simply is less
flamboyant. Other interfaces with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">avy</code>-like model of interaction,
such as optional extensions to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vertico</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">corfu</code> packages,
have these same changes, in the interest of consistency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Update the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meow</code> sample configuration in the manual. This package
is not directly supported at the theme level because (i) I do not
use it and (ii) it is very hard for an outsider to it to trigger the
display of all of its faces in the right context. Without seeing how
all of them look together, I cannot come up with a reliable design.
The manual offers a “good enough” approximation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadened the support of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vterm</code> faces to include the “bright”
colours, while updating those that were already covered. Thanks to
Edgar Vincent for informing me that some of the vterm faces were
changed a while ago. This was done in issue 317 on the GitLab
mirror: <a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/-/issues/317">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/-/issues/317</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Revised the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-column-title</code> face to inherit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixed-pitch</code>
face if the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-mixed-fonts</code> is non-nil. This
user option makes it possible to have a buffer with proportionately
spaced fonts (such as by enabling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">variable-pitch-mode</code>), while
keeping spacing-sensitive elements, like tables and code blocks, in a
monospaced font.</p>

    <p>Thanks to pedro-nonfree for bringing this matter to my attention in
issue 129: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/129">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/129</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simplified the helper function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes--retrieve-palette-value</code>
to make it more efficiently. Thanks to Basil L. Contovounesios for
the contribution in merge request 60 on the GitLab mirror:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/-/merge_requests/60">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/-/merge_requests/60</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reworded the minibuffer prompt of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-list-colors</code>
command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Made Ivy and IDO subdirectories and “virtual” buffers easier to tell
apart from matching text highlights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Included coverage for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auto-dim-other-buffers-hide-face</code> of the
package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">auto-dim-other-buffers</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Covered the built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abbrev-table-name</code> face.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
