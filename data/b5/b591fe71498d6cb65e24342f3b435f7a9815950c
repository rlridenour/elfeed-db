Strikes also hit the eastern city of Kharkiv, where apartment buildings caught fire and dozens were wounded, while Ukraine&#x27;s energy ministry reported emergency power outages in multiple regions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/FaedBvtBZpAbfAVL-3gSbxaSueL3usKEIufoyz_UeeW2znbkd7UwG6Xr6hSl9LWJE0X_Vq2RW1RBb7W7UJHeGsO0RdHJiDeiErkXbs4iU58RaYaBGmWLDV7htXxpgD0S1PV4Srt6sirES_2_qmjiEAOtvxqvx926wmIHoDctKnsfJBjd6U-mOXIKTew' alt='Rescue workers at the site of a strike on a residential building in Ternopil, Ukraine, on Wednesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Neighboring responses: Poland temporarily closed two airports and scrambled fighter jets, and neighbouring Romania activated air-defence measures as the barrage unfolded</li><li>Kharkiv damage: Explosive drones struck residential blocks in Kharkiv, sparking fires, forcing residents to flee and leaving dozens wounded including children, according to regional officials</li><li>Western city hits: Western Ukraine was also targeted: Lviv suffered damage to key sites though officials reported no casualties there in initial assessments</li><li>Local fatalities elsewhere: Separate overnight strikes in Kharkiv Oblast’s Berestyn reportedly killed a 17‑year‑old girl and injured others, local media reported</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine energy ministry: The attacks caused emergency power outages in a number of regions, according to the energy ministry.
