The Florida-based electronics manufacturer already produces AirPods plastic casings at its existing plant in Pune, and is now looking to increase sourcing from India through the new facility in Tiruchirappalli. The company reportedly met with Tamil Nadu's chief minister recently, although construction of the new facility has yet to start. Jabil aims to finalize its expansion plans by July.<br/>

The development is another step in Apple's ongoing strategy to diversify its supply chain beyond China amid increasing trade tensions and tariff uncertainties. The current process involves shipping AirPods casings made in India to assembly plants in China and Vietnam.<br/>
