<p>As <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2026/01/scott-galloway-shows-how-you-can-stop-government-overreach-with-a-smart-economic-strike.html">mentioned here last week,</a> Scott Galloway argued that Americans have one way to reverse the violent overreach of the federal government: launch a one-month economic strike aimed at major tech and AI companies, with the goal of reducing America’s GDP and making the markets wobble. When the markets gyrated after “Liberation Day,” President Trump immediately <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariff-pause-bond-market-bond-yield-treasury-bill/">rolled back many tariffs</a>. Now, if Americans can flex their economic muscles in February, Galloway wagers the administration will rethink whether it wants to keep arresting journalists and letting masked ICE agents shoot civilians in the streets—with impunity.</p>
<p>Today, Galloway has launched a new website, <strong><a href="https://www.resistandunsubscribe.com/">Resist and Unsubscribe</a></strong>, that provides an action plan for a monthlong strike. In the “<strong>Ground Zero</strong>” section of <strong><a href="https://www.resistandunsubscribe.com/">the site</a>,</strong> Galloway lists subscription services from America’s largest technology companies—Amazon, Meta, Google, Apple, Netflix, OpenAI, and Microsoft—and provides links that let users unsubscribe quickly. He also suggests holding off on buying new hardware and products from these companies (e.g. iPhones). <span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you use February</span> to review your subscriptions and find ones to cut, you’ll clean up your personal finances. You’ll also get the attention of the major technology companies that account for one-third of the S&amp;P 500. When the tech CEOs get “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LJmqDQVQaEA">yippy</a>,” so too will Trump.</p>
<p>In the “<strong>Blast Zone</strong>” section of <strong><a href="https://www.resistandunsubscribe.com/">Resist and Unsubscribe</a></strong>, Galloway lists consumer‑facing companies he has “identified as active enablers of ICE,” naming AT&amp;T, Comcast, Lowe’s, Marriott, and Spotify among others. He explains how these companies support ICE and recommends specific services you can cancel or avoid. Scroll down the page to see these suggestions.</p>
<p>Visit <strong><a href="https://www.resistandunsubscribe.com/">Resist and</a><a href="https://www.resistandunsubscribe.com/"> Unsubscribe</a></strong>, find some services to cancel (it’s not a large sacrifice), and spread the word. You can also find more information about the Resist and Unsubscribe movement on Galloway’s blog, “<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/resist-and-unsubscribe/">No Mercy/No Malice</a>.”</p>
