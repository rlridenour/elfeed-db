<p>You probably have heard about famous emacs <code>M-x calc</code>.
I always wanted to become a poweruser of it but never could. My needs are too simple for it, I just want to quickly add/subtract numbers.</p>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve discovered built-in <code>M-x quick-calc</code> which is perfect for what I need. It is already bound to <code>C-x * q</code>.</p>
<p>You can quickly calculate what&rsquo;s needed
and the result is going to be saved to the kill-ring. You can paste the result in place if you want by prefixing the command with <code>C-u</code>.</p>
