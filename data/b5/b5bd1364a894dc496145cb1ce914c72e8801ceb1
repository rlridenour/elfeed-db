<p>When <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2015/05/27/tragic-meaningful-life-legendary-princeton-mathematician-john-nash-dies">John Nash</a> wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.upc.edu/~ia/nash51.pdf">“Non-Cooperative Games,”</a>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13pt;">his&nbsp;Ph.D. dissertation at Princeton in 1950, the text of his thesis (</span><a style="font-size: 13pt;" href="https://www.cs.upc.edu/~ia/nash51.pdf">read it online</a><span style="font-size: 13pt;">) was brief. It ran only 26 pages. And more particularly, it was light on citations. Nash’s diss cited&nbsp;two texts:&nbsp;</span><a style="font-size: 13pt;" href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/game-theory/neumann.html" rel="nofollow">John&nbsp;von Neumann</a><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> and Oskar Morgenstern’s </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><em style="font-size: 13pt;"><a href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7802.pdf">Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</a>&nbsp;</em>(1944), which</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">&nbsp;essentially created game theory and revolutionized the field of economics; the other cited text, </span><a style="font-size: 13pt;" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/36/1/48" rel="nofollow">“Equilibrium Points in n‑Person Games,”</a><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> was an article written by Nash himself. And it laid the foundation for his dissertation, another seminal work in the development of game theory, for which Nash was awarded the </span><a style="font-size: 13pt;" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1994/nash/facts/">Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994</a><span style="font-size: 13pt;">.</span></p>
