<p>Earlier this year, I published a post about <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2025/04/play-connections/">a Shortcut I made</a> to help me c̸h̸e̸a̸t̸ play the <em>NY Times</em> Connections game on my iPhone. It’s called “Play Connections,” and it takes a screenshot, crops it to just the game grid, and saves it to Photos. I then use the highlighter tool in Photos to color in related clues before playing the game for real on the web page.</p>
<p>The Shortcut still works well, but only when the <em>Times</em> doesn’t have a stripe running across the top of the page begging me to hurry and subscribe for 75% off. The stripe pushes everything down, which offsets the cropping. For a while, I’d scroll down a bit to account for the stripe, but as the <em>Times</em> began including the stripe more and more often, I got tired of scrolling.<sup id="fnref:subscription"><a href="#fn:subscription" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> So I made a new Shortcut, “Stripe Connections,” that crops to the game grid when there’s a stripe across the top. You can <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/44b8031218a9494493e9059e33ca476d">download it</a> or make it yourself from these four steps:</p>

<p>Now I activate Siri and say either “Play Connections” or “Stripe Connections” to get the screenshot I want.</p>
