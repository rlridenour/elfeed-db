<p>This graph has 5 edges, and we&#8217;ve managed to label its vertices in a remarkable way: Each vertex bears some integer from 0 to 5, no two receive the same integer, and each edge is now uniquely identified by the absolute difference between its endpoints, such that this magnitude lies between 1 and 5 inclusive. Such a labeling is called <em>graceful</em>.</p>
<p>In 2008 Donald E. Knuth made <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContiguousUSAGraph.html">a graph representing the contiguous 48 states and the District of Columbia</a> in which each pair of states are connected if they&#8217;re joined by at least one drivable road. It turns out that this graph can be labeled gracefully.</p>
<p>And, amazingly, in 2020 T. Rokicki discovered that if you undertake an imaginary journey on Knuth&#8217;s map, starting in California and going up the Pacific coast and then along the Canadian border, you&#8217;ll visit successive vertices labeled 31, 41, 59, 26, 53, 58, 97, 93, 23, 84, 62, 64, 33, 83, and 27. These are <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GracefulPi-Way.html">the first 30 decimal digits of &#960;</a>! </p>
<p>Knuth called this a &#8220;graceful miracle.&#8221;</p>
