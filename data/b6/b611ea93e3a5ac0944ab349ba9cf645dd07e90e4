<p>Australia’s federal Senate has suspended Pauline Hanson, leader of the right‑wing One Nation party, for seven sitting days after she entered the chamber wearing a burqa as a protest against the failure of her bill to ban full-face coverings in public places. Hanson put on the garment in Parliament House in Canberra on Monday, arguing that full veils pose security risks and undermine what she describes as Australian values. A majority of senators backed a censure motion imposing one of the strongest penalties used in recent decades after she refused to apologise, saying her actions disrespected Muslim Australians and risked fuelling abuse against women and girls who wear Islamic dress. The episode has sparked a wider national conversation about religious freedom, parliamentary conduct and how Australia responds to rising far-right and extremist rhetoric, even as many politicians emphasised support for Muslim communities and social cohesion.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/tyujXnqw3AZv4a-k4S-pKdhIo1DGHnq0_F7j2A_CsX83mzVjjC5Ue5brjgVl-Z9QOiS_SFIU_7QNKV-5GIXPr4Rkqfwg72_doz_R8BL3E47GURT1QT6LrVBZWav7INZGFoxEhIOJ7276z2M5n7VqR44FqwZX5EZRiAZVPtx-Cgljjn81HtHla0h3De-Lkg' alt='Senator Pauline Hanson wearing a burqa in the Australian Senate as part of her protest against full-face coverings.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Censure details: The Senate’s censure motion bars Hanson from attending seven consecutive sitting days, a punishment described as among the harshest imposed on an Australian senator in recent decades.</li><li>Bill’s rejection: Hanson’s move followed her failure to secure debate on draft legislation seeking to prohibit full-face coverings in public spaces across Australia, which did not advance in the chamber.</li><li>Concerns for Muslim women: Independent senator Fatima Payman warned the stunt would likely embolden bullying and harassment of Muslim schoolgirls and women wearing hijabs or other Islamic dress in public.</li><li>Cross‑party criticism: Politicians from the Labor government, the Liberal–National opposition, the Greens and crossbenchers all criticised the protest as disrespectful and divisive, saying it cheapened parliamentary debate and distracted from substantive policy issues.</li><li>Extremism context: Cabinet minister Tanya Plibersek linked the incident to broader concerns about right‑wing extremism, contrasting it with recent public activity by neo‑Nazi groups outside New South Wales Parliament.</li></ul><blockquote>I don’t remember the last time someone in a burqa robbed a bank, but I do recall a couple of weeks ago that there was a queue of neo-Nazis standing outside NSW Parliament. - Tanya Plibersek</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pauline Hanson / One Nation: Hanson argued that wearing the burqa in the Senate was a deliberate protest to draw attention to her push to bar full-face coverings in public, which she frames as a security and social-integration issue rather than an attack on a particular faith.
