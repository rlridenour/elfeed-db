<blockquote>
  <p>Apple, Dell, Oracle — which rely on hardware and global supply
chains that are in the direct line of fire from tariffs — saw
their shares go into free-fall. But there was another big tech
company whose stock took a pummeling even though its core business
has little to do with hardware: Meta. [...]</p>

<p>The effect of tariffs on Meta’s ad business is simple. Many of
its small and medium-sized advertisers are from all across the
world. President Trump’s tariffs will instantly make it more
expensive for them to sell their products to customers in the
United States. [...]</p>

<p>Last year, the company disclosed that 10 percent of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/business/google-meta-temu-shein.html">its revenue in
2023 was from Chinese companies spending heavily</a> on advertising
across Facebook and Instagram, an ad blitz aimed at garnering a
foothold in lucrative Western markets.</p>

<p>Much of that growth was fueled by the explosive expansion of the
fast-fashion company Shein — which is based in Singapore but has
a supply chain that is largely in China — and the e-commerce app
Temu, a low-cost, Amazon-like company owned by the Chinese
e-commerce conglomerate Pinduoduo. Temu was estimated to have
spent $3 billion in marketing costs in 2023 alone, according to
estimates from Bernstein Research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the stock market began crumbling after Trump’s announcement Wednesday, I didn’t get why Meta was being hit so hard. Meta makes devices, but unlike Apple, that’s just a side hustle. Meta isn’t a retailer like Amazon. But Meta <em>is</em> a huge advertising destination for retailers. It’s all interconnected.</p>
