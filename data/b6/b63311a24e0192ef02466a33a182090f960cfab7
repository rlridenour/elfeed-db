<p>A minutes-long daylight heist at Paris’s Louvre saw masked thieves break in through a window, smash display cases in the Galerie d’Apollon, and flee with jewellery described by officials as of “inestimable” heritage value [reuters.com#1][washingtonpost.com#1][theguardian.com#1]. The culprits accessed the building using a basket lift/external hoist, used power tools to cut through panes, and escaped on motorbikes as authorities began compiling a detailed inventory of what was taken; no injuries were reported [pbs.org#1][time.com#1][reuters.com#1][politico.eu#1]. The museum closed for the day “for exceptional reasons” while police launched an investigation into suspected organized theft and criminal conspiracy [reuters.com#1][time.com#1]. One item — a 19th‑century crown linked to Empress Eugénie — was recovered damaged near the museum as a manhunt continued [politico.eu#1][scmp.com#1][ndtv.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JQE6C8rJYNtr8Bb4n_vx7BAx-k3ProtUy_ojB8jTjVFHVnzjiYm9fWn6ZGqIXNVZ_nvgdub6dPYHNPcAys6BB0nFu0o2lM5o9CAtiGZfZ5Z7K69fPSgca5Gh27a_PmJCe4sktNViqijcPb9JNSUnO3t8P9I8cWQoZUXteAuw9iNueXuXFZSe4virFlTcciBOMN3PVzg7wMrN06IPsV-cuv-mZHGEgXRMuf1YIyPkSEG8Sv6EJwpgE1ljMc9FJya9gZ94Cl7kBAwucmWJBg' alt='A basket lift outside the Louvre, which thieves reportedly used to reach a window during the heist.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Visitor scale: The Louvre is the world’s most visited museum, drawing 8.7 million visitors in 2024, underscoring the high-profile nature of the theft [time.com#1].</li><li>Minister response: Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez called it “a major, highly organized operation,” noting evidence of scouting and use of a disc cutter to access the jewels [time.com#1].</li><li>Security strain: The incident comes amid staff complaints that crowding and thin staffing have strained museum security, according to reporting from Paris [theglobeandmail.com#1].</li><li>Recent pattern: French outlets noted several other museums were recently targeted by burglars, highlighting potential flaws in security systems nationwide [france24.com#5].</li><li>Item inventory: Authorities are still compiling a precise list of stolen pieces, with counts differing across early reports [reuters.com#1][lemonde.fr#1][politico.eu#1].</li></ul><blockquote>A hold-up took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre Museum. - Rachida Dati</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>French Interior Ministry: Said the stolen jewellery has inestimable heritage value and that investigators are compiling a detailed list.
