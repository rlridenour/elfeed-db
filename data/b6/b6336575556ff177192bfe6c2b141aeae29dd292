<p>Chile will hold a presidential runoff on 14 December after no candidate won an outright majority in Sunday’s first round, with Jeannette Jara and José Antonio Kast advancing to the second round. Jeannette Jara, a former labour minister and candidate of the Communist Party who is aligned with the centre-left governing coalition, led the count with about 26.8 percent while José Antonio Kast, leader of the Republican Party, received roughly 23.9 percent of valid ballots. The race sets up a stark choice between the governing coalition’s left and a hard-right challenger often described as Trump-style, with public security and immigration emerging as dominant voter concerns amid a rise in murders, kidnappings and extortion over the past decade. The next president will take office for the 2026–2030 term, and the outcome will determine who succeeds President Gabriel Boric Font.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/OZ_ncbc9js-IkFaC_inqcdfFW_2C-MsYTFRqcoif2ZfVMGItBwC1neQKFLqYL8Xdug6IYq0PlO9HRCoFNgl4vwSTNbrtPmbXrUyOdQxW9b0qsB9PzanzgIBMzSkKEysATGrBytG4Xx8n8xwO5dkJ1fdzSSs7Vqyr-LymIuxJfGKSx_luSW2pXP9n02S2tbpDzvErabl4-3mV1zTmKBO8PGECagznBpqG-XENRw0' alt='Jeannette Jara and José Antonio Kast in Santiago de Chile.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Right-wing plurality: Combined right-wing forces secured majority support across the ballot in the first round, giving the conservative bloc structural leverage heading into the runoff.</li><li>Kast&#x27;s profile: José Antonio Kast is the leader of the Republican Party, a veteran lawmaker who has framed his campaign around tougher security and immigration measures and has been described in reporting as an admirer of President Trump.</li><li>Jara&#x27;s background: Jeannette Jara, 51, is a former labour minister and the Communist Party candidate of the centre-left governing coalition who won the largest single share of votes in the first round.</li><li>Security concerns: Public security dominated debate after a sharp rise in murders, kidnappings and extortion blamed in reporting on transnational gangs over the last decade.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Jeannette Jara / Communist Party: Jara ran as the main candidate tied to the governing centre-left coalition and topped the first-round count, positioning herself as the continuity candidate for the coalition in power.
