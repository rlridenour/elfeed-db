<p>What kind of gift could you suggest? Anything (so long as it costs no more than $100).</p>
<p>It could be something you have and like and think others would, too. It could be something you want for yourself. It could be something you know someone on your gift list wants.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re selected in the random drawing as the winner, you can pick a gift that would be for yourself, or for a friend or family member, for your department, or even a random stranger.</p>
<p>There have already been many great gifts suggested. But we need about 50 more suggestions over the next few days.</p>
<p>So if you haven&#8217;t done so yet, head on over to the <strong><a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/11/21/tell-us-about-a-great-holiday-gift-and-you-might-just-get-it/">Daily Nous Gift Guide Giveaway page</a></strong> and leave a comment with a gift idea.</p>
<p>And then share this post with your colleagues, friends, and students. Anyone who teaches philosophy, is a student of philosophy, writes academic philosophy, or works as staff in a philosophy department is eligible to participate.</p>
<p>Thanks, philosofriends!</p>
