A short animation accompanying Joswiak's teaser reveals a brief glimpse of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> along with the words "coming soon." The shape of the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is a V, which is the Roman numeral for 5. Joswiak also used "Mmmmm" in his caption, which is 5 Ms.<br/>

Rumors suggest that Apple is preparing to introduce its next-generation M5 chip this week, and it is set to debut in the 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;.<br/>

<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mmmmm… something powerful is coming. <a href="https://t.co/hHDYwuisJC">pic.twitter.com/hHDYwuisJC</a></p>&mdash; Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) <a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1978172574782665062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Aside from an M5 chip, the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is not expected to get any other major design changes. So far, it looks like Apple might introduce just the 14-inch M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, holding higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips until 2026. <br/>

Apple is also expected to introduce a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and Vision Pro with an M5 chip this week, and we could also potentially see new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> models. <br/>
