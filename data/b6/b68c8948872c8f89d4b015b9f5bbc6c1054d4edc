<p>A South Korean court sentenced former first lady Kim Keon Hee to 20 months in prison after convicting her of bribery tied to gifts and cash, according to multiple outlets. The ruling makes Kim the first former presidential spouse in South Korea to be convicted on a criminal charge, intensifying scrutiny of the country’s political elite and legal institutions. The verdict also lands amid broader political fallout involving her husband, former president Yoon Suk Yeol, whose 2024 declaration of martial law remains a key reference point in coverage of the couple’s political downfall.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SC8zAN3os666frqkqyfYvRlAfog7b-aGRoxEGAewe9ubvrkvZ7_lx0v-oeCbuN8xTPya6OSvAQsQbWfsnUVhSqTtteDBRI3dnzXXv59pNiAHzN-MM6Py_JZ6I0K3MG4OI6sjHibNG2qRvjSGB-wj4thTuRd53BjfUStb0paVyWYYNrfpT9GEFWusGnaok10O1pwlWX01GY0qUkOa9lywI6tjA_c' alt='Kim Keon Hee arrives for a hearing at Seoul Central District Court in September.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Restitution ordered: The court ordered Kim to return a Graff diamond necklace and repay 12.85 million won in cash, the BBC reported.</li><li>Partial acquittals: The court acquitted Kim of alleged stock manipulation and other charges, SCMP reported.</li><li>Prosecutors’ request: Prosecutors had sought a much heavier penalty, including a 15-year jail term plus a 2 billion won fine and 948 million won in forfeiture, according to SCMP.</li><li>Unification Church link: Several reports describe the bribery allegations as involving Unification Church officials seeking political favors in exchange for gifts.</li><li>Public spotlight: BBC’s profile of Kim recounts sustained scrutiny over luxury handbags and other high-end gifts tied to corruption allegations.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prosecutors: Prosecutors argued Kim’s conduct warranted a far tougher punishment than the sentence imposed, seeking lengthy imprisonment and significant financial penalties.
