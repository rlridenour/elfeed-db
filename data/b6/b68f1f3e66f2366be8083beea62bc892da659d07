Apple has big plans to improve <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> over the next few years, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and Drake Bennett</a> report.<br/>

Some Apple executives are now reportedly pushing to turn &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; into a true ChatGPT competitor. A next-generation, chatbot version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has reportedly made significant progress during testing over the past six months; some executives allegedly now see it as "on par" with recent versions of ChatGPT. Apple is also apparently discussing giving &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; the ability to access the internet to gather and synthesize data from multiple sources, just like ChatGPT.<br/>
<br/>
The report added that Apple now has artificial intelligence offices in Zurich, where employees are working on an all-new software architecture for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. This "monolithic model" is entirely built on an LLM engine that will eventually replace &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s current "hybrid" architecture that has been incoherently layered up with different functionality over many years. The new model will make &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; more conversational and better at synthesizing information.<br/>

Google's Gemini is expected to be added to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a> as an alternative to ChatGPT in &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, but Apple is also apparently in talks with Perplexity to add their AI service as another option in the future, for both &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and Safari search.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/next-gen-siri-is-on-par-with-chatgpt/">Report: Apple&#039;s Next-Gen Version of Siri Is &#039;On Par&#039; With ChatGPT</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apples-next-gen-version-of-siri-is-on-par-with-chatgpt.2457337/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
