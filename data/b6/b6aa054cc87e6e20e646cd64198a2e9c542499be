The AirPods market appears to be flatlining in the United States, but the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> later this year could boost sales, a new report claims.<br/>

According to a <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/airpods-succeed-yet-need-to-succeed">new report</a> from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), approximately 44% of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners in the United States now report owning Bluetooth earbuds, up from 41% in the previous year. Of those, 59% say they use AirPods. This represents a small gain from 57% the year before, effectively bringing the figure back to its 2023 level. This means AirPods are used by roughly 26% of all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; owners in the United States today.<br/>
<br/>
While the data reflects a recovery in Apple's share of the Bluetooth earbuds market among &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users, it does not indicate meaningful growth beyond previous highs. The size of the market is increasing slowly, and Apple is maintaining its portion, but not expanding it. <br/>
<br/>
AirPods face growing challenges from competitors including Samsung, Sony, and Bose, as well as a wide array of low-cost alternatives. Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 in September 2022, featuring the H2 chip, improved noise cancellation, enhanced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> integration, and more.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 were offered at a substantial discount during Amazon Prime Day earlier this month, with the price reduced from &#36;249 to &#36;149. Best Buy and Walmart quickly matched the pricing, despite Apple maintaining its full price on its website and in stores.<br/>
<br/>
The &#36;100 discount represented one of the steepest markdowns ever for the current-generation model. CIRP speculated that Apple and Amazon may have sought to clear out existing inventory ahead of the anticipated launch of a new model. The more likely explanation was apparently a desire to drive high-volume sales through temporary margin flexibility. <br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/airpods-pro-3-upgrades-worth-waiting-for/">AirPods Pro 3</a> are likely to be announced later this year, perhaps alongside new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch models in September. The new model is expected to feature improved ANC, enhanced sound, design tweaks, and heart rate monitoring.<br/>
<br/>
The refresh is expected to target both new customers and existing users with degrading batteries or older models. CIRP says that, as one of the most frequently reordered items on Amazon, AirPods provide Apple with an opportunity to capitalize on a faster-moving product line amid slowing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; upgrades.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirp/">CIRP</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/airpods-pro-3-to-turn-around-sales-flatline/">Report: AirPods Pro 3 Needed to Turn Around Sales Flatline</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-airpods-pro-3-needed-to-turn-around-sales-flatline.2461681/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
