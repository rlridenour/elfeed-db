<p>Venezuelan opposition figure Juan Pablo Guanipa—an ally of opposition leader María Corina Machado—was detained again in Caracas just hours after being released, the latest jolt in the country’s political standoff. Venezuela’s Public Ministry (top prosecutor’s office) said Guanipa had violated the conditions of his release and that prosecutors asked for measures including house arrest. Early official statements did not clearly say whether he was already back in government custody. The move came the same day reports said at least 35 political prisoners were freed, briefly raising hopes of a less tense climate. Guanipa’s swift return to detention—after he called for elections—highlighted how fragile any opening remains: the opposition described it as a forcible abduction, while the government framed it as enforcement of release conditions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/mhmQ7RC2McNYKID2HYtYWO_yO9FAzvRZr6JkVITIy6KxjpII13PIAzi4du71PeBZCpgOxu81ulY7a1KcF937c3Zb-rX1jbbkyLxg7aVFOZZ2g0TJ9kugMjpJJtm6-xEvlhsejIEopAjVhWRbMNdViufe607i3ITw0HIlOaJhYIttjGW-vNXWZMqoCpTet9ynq0budKsfd-LSnbT0PzEbyC6KIaAqmV9dow' alt='People gather amid reports of political prisoner releases and renewed detentions in Venezuela.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Detention context: The Guardian said Guanipa spent nearly nine months in detention before authorities freed him on Sunday.</li><li>How it happened: Reuters said heavily armed men in civilian clothing seized Guanipa in Caracas; the opposition described it as being taken by force.</li><li>What authorities sought: Prosecutors said they requested measures including house arrest, and some coverage described Guanipa as being placed under house arrest after the alleged release-condition violations.</li><li>Political message: Firstpost said opposition-aligned figures saw the rearrest as a warning to pro-reform voices, including Machado.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Venezuela’s Public Ministry/top prosecutor: Officials said they sought Guanipa’s arrest and house arrest after he violated the terms of his release, though early public statements left it unclear whether he was in custody.
