<p>Ukraine is enduring a deep mid-winter power crunch after Russian missile and drone strikes hit energy infrastructure, triggering rolling blackouts and forcing some Kyiv schools to close as temperatures dropped well below freezing. Officials and aid agencies say the outages have also undermined heating and basic services, leaving families coping day-to-day and pushing communities to rely more on backup generators and public “warming” support points. The immediate effect has been a harder winter routine for millions, while Ukraine continues repair work and tries to stabilize electricity supply under continued attack.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PLH-Iy4Cz8HpZQuBKvzl4OZBqoar_WNMNFpMG9wVzIGrmCGGQlZznv-um5ZTy3Pv0slAnbYb_PnA1cZXNPJdFSN6rLGcRS_gLwoav2EoocwDb8Tytj5pf7nug6mo-Slob709l51cJ8mdFV3LN03qykAILpT0KfBn1Qqc6krm0QY_tMH_MZnMNIChIc0GvgDAewrLCw445OU_ELiW' alt='A residential area during a power blackout this month in Kyiv.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Supply gap: Ukraine’s power system has been able to cover only about 60% of electricity demand after the latest attacks, according to reporting that cited Ukrainian energy officials.</li><li>Emergency hubs: Kyiv residents have leaned on emergency centres offering warmth, charging, and basic services during outages, according to on-the-ground reporting.</li><li>Child safety: UNICEF warned that repeated strike waves and sub-zero conditions have left many children and families in “constant survival mode,” including stretches without power for days.</li><li>Grid pressure: Reports describe repair crews and utilities working to keep the grid running while renewed strikes keep degrading generation and distribution capacity.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Kyiv city education officials: School closures and schedule changes are being used to keep children safe and learning amid unreliable electricity and heating.
