<p>From a press release from the UK’s National Drought Group this week, quoting group chair Helen Wakeham (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We are grateful to the public for following the restrictions,
where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions. Simple,
everyday choices — such as turning off a tap or <em>deleting old
emails</em> — also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand
and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To reaffirm that she did not misspeak, from a list of tips for conserving water at home, which includes legit tips like taking shorter showers and turning off the tap while brushing your teeth (<em>Sidenote: Who leaves the water running while brushing their teeth?</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Delete old emails and pictures as data centres require vast
amounts of water to cool their systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is so profoundly stupid and wrong that I don’t even know how to make fun of it. But it sure speaks to how futile it might be to hope that the UK government understands the first thing about end-to-end encryption.
