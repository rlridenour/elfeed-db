<blockquote>
  <p>There are really two separate issues at hand: Should users be allowed to make fetish content of <em>any</em> woman who is stupid enough (like me) to allow anyone to make cameos of her? And how do you stop people from making fetish content of purely AI-generated characters that aren’t cameos of real people? Does OpenAI want to stop that? Maybe OpenAI thinks it’s fine for people to make belly-flation or foot-fetish videos as long as they’re not of a real person.</p>

<p>For now, I keep going back to a thought I had early on while scrolling <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sora-videos-openai-content-moderation-celebrities-teens-boys-girls-2025-10">Sora: There’s hardly any women on here</a>, and it’s no wonder why. Women innately understand the risk of letting anyone make videos with their faces — the likelihood of something being creepy is extremely high. These fetish videos are kind of goofy — I have to admit I even cracked up a little at the centaur one — but overall, it’s an icky and somewhat menacing feeling seeing a lot of them.</p>
