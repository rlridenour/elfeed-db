<p>Mike Isaac, reporting for The New York Times, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/technology/meta-cuts-metaverse-unit.html?unlocked_article_code=1.608.XuJW.cN8SImoOdegY">Meta Weighs Cuts to Its Metaverse Unit</a>” (gift link):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meta is considering making cuts to a division in its Reality Labs
unit that works on the so-called metaverse, said three employees
with knowledge of the matter.</p>

<p>The cuts could come as soon as next month and amount to 10 to 30
percent of employees in the Metaverse unit, which works on virtual
reality headsets and a V.R.-based social network, the people said.
The numbers of potential layoffs are still in flux, they said.
Other parts of the Reality Labs division develop smart glasses,
wristbands and other wearable devices. The total number of
employees in Reality Labs could not be learned.</p>

<p>Meta does not plan to abandon building the metaverse, the people
said. Instead, executives expect to shift the savings from the
cuts into investments in its augmented reality glasses, the
people said.</p>

<p>Meta confirmed the cuts <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-plans-to-shift-spending-away-from-the-metaverse-d0ac3b7f">to the Wall Street Journal</a>, and <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/251204/p27#a251204p27">Bloomberg’s Kurt Wagner broke the news Thursday</a>.</p>

<p>I’m so old that I remember ... checks notes ... four years ago, when Facebook renamed itself Meta in late 2021 with <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">this statement</a>: “Meta’s focus will be to bring the metaverse to life and help people connect, find communities and grow businesses.” And <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/">Mark Zuckerberg, announcing the change, wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But all of our products, including our apps, now share a new
vision: to help bring the metaverse to life. And now we have a
name that reflects the breadth of what we do.</p>

<p>From now on, we will be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first. That
means that over time you won’t need a Facebook account to use our
other services. As our new brand starts showing up in our
products, I hope people around the world come to know the Meta
brand and the future we stand for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of us never fell for this metaverse nonsense. For example, I’m also old enough to remember just one year later, near the end of Joanna Stern’s on-stage interview with Craig Federighi and Greg Joswiak at a 2022 WSJ event, seven months before Vision Pro was announced (<a href="https://youtu.be/m-ugwoEOMvg?t=1770">at the 29:30 mark</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stern:</strong> You have to finish this sentence, both of you. The
metaverse is...</p>

<p><strong>Joz:</strong> A word I’ll never use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He might want to use the word now, just to make jokes.</p>

<p>Om Malik, <a href="https://blog.om.co/2025/04/28/no-gruber-this-is-why-facebook-renamed-itself/">writing in April this year</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of us are old enough to remember that the reason Mark renamed
the company is because the Facebook brand was becoming toxic, and
associated with misinformation and global-scale crap. It was
viewed as a tired, last-generation company. Meta allowed the
company to rebrand itself <a href="https://om.co/2021/10/31/facebook-is-now-meta/">as something amazing and fresh</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, yours truly, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/28/om-malik-facebook-rename">linking to Malik’s post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And so while “Meta” will never be remembered as the company that
spearheaded the metaverse — because the metaverse never was or
will be an actual thing — it’s in truth the perfect name for a
company that believes in nothing other than its own success.</p>
