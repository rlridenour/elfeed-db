Apple is planning to release a fix for an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> camera bug that causes black boxes to appear in photos. <em>CNN Underscored</em>'s Henry Casey discovered the issue <a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/iphone-air">in an iPhone Air review</a> when snapping photos at a concert.<br/>

He said that one out of every 10 images taken with the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; or the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; had "small blacked-out portions, including boxes and parts of white squiggles" that showed up from the LED board at the event.<br/>

Apple told Casey that it's an issue that can occur in "very rare cases when an LED light display is extremely bright and shining directly into the camera." Apple has a fix, and plans to release it in an upcoming software update.<br/>

Apple did not provide a timeline on when the software update might be released, but the new models are set to launch on Friday, September 19.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-17-Pro">iPhone 17 Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/apple-iphone-17-camera-glitch-fix/">Apple to Fix Camera Glitch Affecting iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-fix-camera-glitch-affecting-iphone-air-and-iphone-17-pro.2466253/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
