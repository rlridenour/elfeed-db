<p>For no reason, here&#8217;s a recipe for waffles that John Kennedy ate in the White House, &#8220;his breakfast treat for special occasions&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
1 tablespoon sugar<br />
1/2 cup butter<br />
2 egg yolks<br />
1 cup and 1 tablespoon sifted cake flour<br />
7/8 cup milk or 1 cup buttermilk<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
2 egg whites, stiffly beaten<br />
4 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p>Cream the sugar and butter. Add the egg yolks and beat. Then add the flour and milk alternately. This mixture may be kept in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. When you are ready to bake it, fold in the egg whites, and add the baking powder and salt. Bake on a waffle iron. Serves 3.
