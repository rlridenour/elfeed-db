Apple is planning to launch a "Liquid Silicone" line of cases for iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro models, according to a hit-or-miss leaker known as "<a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1953070043585040883">Majin Bu</a>."<br/>
<br/>

In a <a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-here-are-the-new-liquid-silicone-cases/">blog post today</a>, the leaker shared images of the alleged cases, with some having a ripple effect on the back near the MagSafe charging area. The cases also have multiple cutouts for attaching a lanyard, which may be sold separately.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 has a new Liquid Glass design. The leaker said the "Liquid Silicone" cases will have a "Liquid Glass effect" of some kind, but it is not entirely clear what that means.<br/>
<br/>
AirPods Pro 2 charging cases also have a cutout for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/08/airpods-pro-2-smaller-new-features/">attaching a lanyard</a>, and the iPod touch once had a built-in mechanism for attaching a lanyard.<br/>
<br/>
The cases are described as "official samples," but we are not entirely convinced that they are actually designed by Apple. Some of the cases shown look rather bulky and low quality, so some skepticism is absolutely warranted here.<br/>

Sketchy rumors about iPhone cases are nothing new, and sometimes they do turn out to be at least partially true. There was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/iphone-15-finewoven-case-rumors/">some skepticism about the "FineWoven" name</a> when it first leaked a few years ago, and the name ended up being real, so we are reporting on the "Liquid Silicone" name just in case that name happens to be the real deal.<br/>
<br/>
"Majin Bu" has a mixed track record with Apple rumors. They were most recently accurate about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ipados-19-mac-like-menu-bar-rumor/">iPadOS 26 adding a Mac-like menu bar to iPads</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple should unveil the iPhone 17 series and cases in just over a month from now, so we will not have to wait much longer for official details.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/iphone-17-liquid-silicone-cases-rumor/">Sketchy Rumor: Apple to Launch &#039;Liquid Silicone&#039; iPhone 17 Cases With Optional Lanyard</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sketchy-rumor-apple-to-launch-liquid-silicone-iphone-17-cases-with-optional-lanyard.2462866/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
