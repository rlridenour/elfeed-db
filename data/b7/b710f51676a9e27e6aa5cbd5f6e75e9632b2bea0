<p>I think I first bought OmniOutliner at version 2. I remember it came in shrink wrap at a computer store.</p>



<p>Regardless, I&#8217;ve been using the application for a long time. I&#8217;ve used it to outline countless contracts, depositions, trial examinations, MacSparky videos, books, and podcasts ever since. In my opinion, it is the best-in-class outliner for the Mac.</p>



<p>And now version 6 just dropped.</p>



<p>OmniOutliner 6 brings some welcome changes. The interface got a modernization pass, with Liquid Glass design elements that look great on current Apple hardware. There are also new Dynamic Themes that adjust automatically based on your system settings.</p>



<p>The big news for me is Omni Links. These let you create connections between documents and specific rows within outlines. If you&#8217;re the kind of person who builds complex, interconnected projects (and if you&#8217;re using OmniOutliner seriously, you probably are), this is going to matter.</p>



<p>The Omni Group also added support for querying Apple Intelligence through their Omni Automation system. I&#8217;m still exploring what this means in practice, but the ability to bring AI queries into your outlining workflow has potential.</p>



<p>For the first time, OmniOutliner is now truly universal across Mac, iPad, iPhone, and Apple Vision Pro. Same features everywhere. That&#8217;s been a long time coming.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve been on the fence about OmniOutliner, or if you&#8217;ve let your outlining practice slip, version 6 is a good reason to take another look. The Omni Group continues to make serious software for people who want to think clearly and organize their ideas.</p>
