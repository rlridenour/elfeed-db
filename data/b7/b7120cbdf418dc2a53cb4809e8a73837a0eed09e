<p>Joe Rosensteel, writing at Six Colors, regarding the demise of Apple’s Clips app:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2017/04/clips-review-creative-fun-amidst-idiosyncrasies/">not that it was completely inept</a>, but <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2017/11/clips-20-the-spiritual-successor-to-photo-booth/">it was an
aimless showcase</a> to demonstrate what Apple <em>could</em> do.
It withered over the course of eight years before it was
quietly killed.</p>

<p>At no point did it supplant iMovie for iOS as the fun, easy-breezy
video editor, which is also in a similarly stagnant state. The
only updates iMovie has received in the past year were onboarding
screens for permissions settings.</p>

<p>Why is it that Apple can make what is widely regarded as the best
video recording experience on any smartphone, but it can’t make a
good video editor for a smartphone? Is it partly because these
apps don’t have direct payments, so they can only ever be demos
for hardware and services that <em>do</em> earn money?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rosensteel is concerned about the radio silence from Apple regarding Pixelmator and Photomator, the apps (and team) that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/01/pixelmator-apple">Apple acquired a year ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course, Apple may be assembling its own mirror of the Adobe
Creative Cloud suite so that it can charge one bundle price for
access to a suite of pro apps, and maybe that’s why pricing for
everything is frozen in place, and the iPad Pro apps aren’t in
step with the Mac ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s what I hope: that Apple is somewhere near the cusp of announcing some sort of “pro apps” subscription.</p>
