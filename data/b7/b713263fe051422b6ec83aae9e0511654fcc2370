Mitch Randall’s sermon this Sunday was on loving one’s enemies, a notion that I believe is the radically distinctive concept in the ethics of Jesus. This week’s prayer:
</p>

 <p>
In this deeply divided world, <br></br>
the best we hope for is <br></br>
tolerance, <br></br>
absence of conflict, <br></br>
live and let live. <br></br></p>

 <p>
The path that we have taken <br></br>
is not the way of Jesus, <br></br>
who said, <br></br>
“Love your enemies and <br></br>
pray for those who persecute you.”
</p>

 <p>
It’s not that I don’t pray, Lord.
</p>

 <p>
I pray <br></br>
that they would get what’s coming to them, <br></br>
that they would see things my way, <br></br>
that they would realize how wrong they are.
</p>

 <p>
Teach me, Lord, <br></br>
the difference between <br></br>
“praying for” <br></br>
and merely “praying that….”
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
