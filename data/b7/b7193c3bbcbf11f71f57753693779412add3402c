<p>Back in March <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/on-tyranny">I linked to and recommended</a> Timothy Snyder’s <em><a href="https://timothysnyder.org/on-tyranny/">On Tyranny</a></em>, a cogent collection of 20 short essays. I was never a big e-book reader, both because I love printed books so much and because I welcome any respite from reading on screens of any sort. But if e-books are your thing, note that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/24/on-tyranny">Apple Books currently has it for just $2</a>. Amazon’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3UypaaG">Kindle edition is also $2</a> — and the paperback edition, which is the lovely little thing I own, <a href="https://amzn.to/4mizwHA">is an oddly but low-priced $7.31</a>.</p>
