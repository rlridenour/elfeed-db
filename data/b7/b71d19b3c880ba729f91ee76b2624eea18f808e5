<p>I've been wanting org to keep track of my daily habits for a little while. The catalyst: reading James Clear's wonderful <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> (along with plenty of lock-down inspiration).</p>
<p>As much as I live in Emacs and org mode, it just wasn't practical enough to rely on my laptop for tracking habits. I wanted less friction, so I've been experimenting with building a toy app for my needs. Naturally, org support was a strict requirement, so I could always poke at it from my beloved editor.</p>
<p>I've been using the app every day with success. The habits seem to be sticking, but equally important, it's been really fun to join the fabulous world of Emacs/Org with iOS/SwiftUI.</p>
<p>This is all very experimental[^3] and as mentioned on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ljurwx/org_habits_ios_app_want_to_try_it/">reddit</a> (follow-up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/lp62vn/org_habits_ios_app_followup_twoway_edit/">here</a>) and <a href="https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/1361034010047176705">twitter</a>, the app isn't available on the App Store. I may consider publishing if there's enough interest, but in the mean time, you can reach out and install via <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/">TestFlight</a>.</p>
<p>Send me an email address to <em>flathabits*at*xenodium.com</em> for a TestFlight invite.</p>
<h2>2021-03-12 Update: Now with iOS Files app/sync integration</h2>
<p>If you can sync your org file with your iPhone (ie. Drive/Dropbox/iCloud), and list it in the Files app, you should be able to open/edit[^4] with <em>Flat Habits</em> (that's the name now). With iOS Files integration, you should be able to sync your habits between your iPhone and your <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">funky editor</a> powering org mode[^5].</p>
