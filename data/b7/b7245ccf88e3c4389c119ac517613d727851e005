Many of Apple's announcements during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/wwdc-2025-live-coverage/">WWDC 2025 keynote</a> this week were leaked ahead of time, but there were also a few rumors that proved to be inaccurate. <br/>
<br/>

In this WWDC 2025 edition of our Rumor Report Card, we have reflected on some of the bigger hits and misses leading into Apple's annual developer conference.<br/>
<br/>
The grades that we have assigned to each rumor below are just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>A+</h2><br/>
We give full marks to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, who accurately leaked a wide range of software details ahead of WWDC 2025, including the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">naming convention for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26</a>, and so forth, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/08/ios-26-liquid-glass-20th-anniversary-iphone/">Liquid Glass design</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/ipados-19-more-like-macos/">iPads getting several Mac-like features</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-messages-and-phone-features/">several new Phone and Messages app features</a>, new preinstalled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-games-app-details/">Games</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-and-ipados-26-preview-app/">Preview apps</a> on iOS 26, live translation of calls and texts, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
<em>9to5Mac</em> also accurately leaked several details, ranging from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/ios-26-messages-app-rumors/">Messages app getting polls</a> to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/music-lock-screen-widget-animated-artwork-ios-26/">full-screen album artwork</a> option on the iPhone's Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>B</h2><br/>
Jon Prosser was first to report that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">iOS 26 would feature a new translucent design</a>. In videos on his YouTube channel Front Page Tech, he accurately leaked several iOS 26 design elements, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/ios-19-rounder-app-icons-video/">new floating tab bar within apps</a>. However, at one point he incorrectly said that Home Screen app icons <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/ios-19-rounder-app-icons-video/">would be round</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The leaker @MajinBuOfficial accurately claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ipados-19-mac-like-menu-bar-rumor/">iPadOS 26 would feature a Mac-like menu bar</a> at the top of the screen. However, he wrongly said that the menu bar might only appear when the iPad is connected to a Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>C-</h2><br/>
Ahead of the WWDC 2025 keynote, <em>9to5Mac</em> and <em>MacRumors</em> reported on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/05/homeos-trademark-filings/">homeOS trademark activity</a> that was potentially linked to Apple. homeOS could end up being the name of the operating system that powers Apple's rumored smart home hub, but neither the software platform nor the device were announced at WWDC 2025.<br/>
<br/>
homeOS very well might end up being announced in the future, but speculation that it might be unveiled at WWDC 2025 proved to be inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>F</h2><br/>
@MajinBuOfficial claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/ios-19-iphone-stage-manager-rumor/">iOS 26 would enable Stage Manager on iPhones with a USB-C port</a>, but no such feature was announced at WWDC 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/11/wwdc-2025-rumor-report-card/">WWDC 2025 Rumor Report Card: Which Leaks Were Right or Wrong?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wwdc-2025-rumor-report-card-which-leaks-were-right-or-wrong.2458740/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
