  <p>Apple silicon has been nothing but upside for the Mac, and yet
some seem bored already. In the days since Apple announced the M5,
I’ve seen and heard this sentiment more than I expected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is just another boring incremental upgrade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That 👏 is 👏 the 👏 point.</p>

<p>Back in the PowerPC and Intel days, Macs would sometimes go
<em>years</em> between meaningful spec bumps, as Apple waited on its
partners to deliver appropriate hardware for various machines.
From failing NVIDIA cards in MacBook Pros to 27-inch Intel iMacs
that ran so hot the fans were audible at all times, Mac hardware
wasn’t always what Apple wanted.</p>

<p>Consider the MacBook Air — by all accounts the most popular Mac Apple sells. There was <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2015/03/09Apple-Updates-13-inch-MacBook-Pro-with-Retina-Display-MacBook-Air/">a March 2015 update</a>, and then a <em>very</em> minor speed bump in June 2017. That June 2017 update was so insignificant that it didn’t even warrant its own press release from Apple. All it got from Apple was, at the very end of <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/06/imac-receives-major-update-featuring-more-powerful-graphics-faster-processors-thunderbolt-3-brighter-displays/">a press release</a> touting updates to the iMac, MacBook Pro, and late great 12-inch MacBook, this single sentence: “Apple today also updated the 13-inch MacBook Air with a 1.8 GHz processor.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the very end of October 2018 that Apple released a significant MacBook Air update — the first models with retina displays. For the three-and-a-half-year stretch between March 2015 and October 2018, there wasn’t a single notable MacBook Air refresh — at a time when all other Macs had gone retina. Intel’s processor offerings were so unpalatable during that stretch that Apple just didn’t update their most popular Mac model.</p>
