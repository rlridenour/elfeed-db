<p>In the latest development, Spanish investigators say they have recovered a previously unreported piece of train undercarriage near the site of Sunday night’s high-speed rail disaster near Adamuz in Córdoba province, a find experts say could help determine what happened. Separately, a Barcelona-area commuter train derailed near Gelida after a retaining wall collapsed onto the tracks, killing the train driver and injuring dozens, prompting Catalonia’s rail operator to suspend services until it is safe. Spain is mourning the back-to-back tragedies as officials broaden inquiries into track conditions and other possible factors, while emergency crews continue recovery and evidence-gathering at the southern crash site.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wrR0oEF0034AKa19da7IAFOXpbUx1C75H3C1bK5mtTExXAifG66tzxbNLRBW0vX1cdM7wZbmOpyKnKECMJP3PEvUthnm5upSRxVH7yG4IellxOHDz8Xix25L4jMN3g5G-TWnhubjcUMyx4N6sajkPPQWPgGfkaeQoGMFNCg8yLdmwzX1xJgzcjrOlLnvwLb4mSda5yiNYONrb7WyJ9ny5U5ghDeIQbSHlH-14X_acTZOEayVOn0' alt='The undercarriage of a train found near the crash site near Adamuz, Spain on Tuesday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Wheel marks: Spain’s transport minister Óscar Puente said investigators found unusual grooves on the wheels of the first five Iryo cars and also detected marks on a few trains that passed the same spot before the derailment, which could align with the reported break in the track at kilometer 318 on the Madrid–Seville line.</li><li>Wall collapse: Officials said heavy rainfall likely contributed to the collapse of a retaining wall that fell onto the tracks near Barcelona, setting off the commuter-train derailment that led to multiple serious injuries.</li><li>Strike call: Spain’s train drivers’ union called for strike action, arguing that repeated derailments reflect a “constant deterioration” of the railway and pressing for stronger safety measures and investment.</li><li>Search efforts: At the Adamuz crash scene, canine units have been deployed to help gather evidence as identification work and the removal of derailed train cars continue.</li><li>National shock: Spanish media coverage described widespread grief and anger among families and communities, alongside disruptions to daily travel as authorities work to provide answers.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Spanish Transport Ministry: Investigators are examining wheel and track marks that may indicate a track break at a specific point on the Madrid–Seville line as a key line of inquiry into the Adamuz derailment.
