         
         <p>Customised build of the Iosevka typeface, with a consistent rounded
style and overrides for almost all individual glyphs in both upright
(roman) and slanted (italic) variants. This is the successor to my
now-discontinued “Iosevka Comfy” fonts.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<p>This release includes two stylistic corrections that pertain to
Aporetic Serif and Aporetic Serif Mono.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The first change is to the slanted (italic) form of the letter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code>.
Before, it was mistakenly set to have a curved, upward-facing bottom
stroke, which would clash with the flat bottom of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l</code>. Now
the slanted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t</code> has a flat bottom as intended. The upright (roman)
variants are always flat in this regard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second change is to the letter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> in both upright and slanted
forms. Before, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> would have a top left serif, as intended, but
not a bottom right tail. The tail is a feature of other glyphs that
need to have such a style, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u</code>: it imposes a
proper rhythm together with the rest of the serif details. Now the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code>
has its missing bottom right tail, making everything consistent.</p>

    <p>[ The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> has a shorter middle leg in all the “mono” families” to
  improve readability, especially at small point sizes. The
  proportionately spaced fonts use a normal middle leg, as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m</code> is
  naturally wider there and thus is already perfectly legible. The
  other details are the same. ]</p>
  </li>
</ul>
