<blockquote>
  <p>US government funding for the world’s CVE program — the
centralized Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database of
product security flaws — ends Wednesday.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old CVE program plays a huge role in vulnerability
management. It is responsible overseeing the assignment and
organizing of unique CVE ID numbers, such as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160">CVE-2014-0160</a>
and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754">CVE-2017-5754</a>, for specific vulnerabilities, in this
case OpenSSL’s <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/04/09/heartbleed_explained/">Heartbleed</a> and Intel’s <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/">Meltdown</a>, so
that when referring to particular flaws and patches, everyone is
agreed on exactly what we’re all talking about.</p>

<p>The good news: they were ready. <a href="https://www.thecvefoundation.org/">Announcing the CVE Foundation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since its inception, the CVE Program has operated as a U.S.
government-funded initiative, with oversight and management
provided under contract. While this structure has supported the
program’s growth, it has also raised longstanding concerns among
members of the CVE Board about the sustainability and neutrality
of a globally relied-upon resource being tied to a single
government sponsor.</p>

<p>This concern has become urgent following an April 15, 2025 letter
from MITRE notifying the CVE Board that the U.S. government does
not intend to renew its contract for managing the program. While
we had hoped this day would not come, we have been preparing for
this possibility.</p>

<p>In response, a coalition of longtime, active CVE Board members
have spent the past year developing a strategy to transition CVE
to a dedicated, non-profit foundation. The new CVE Foundation will
focus solely on continuing the mission of delivering high-quality
vulnerability identification and maintaining the integrity and
availability of CVE data for defenders worldwide.</p>
