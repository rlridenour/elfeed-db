         
         <p>As part of the current development cycle of Denote, I am refining the
file prompt. It now has the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sorting:</strong> Files are sorted by last modified.</li>
  <li><strong>Grouping:</strong> Files are organised by type (remember that the Denote
file-naming scheme can be applied to any file—I do so for videos,
pictures, PDFs, …).</li>
  <li><strong>Affixating:</strong> Files have their date identifier as a prefix and
their keywords as a suffix.</li>
</ul>

<p>The file prompt is used when linking to a file, like with the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-link</code> command, or when calling the command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-open-or-create</code> (and related).</p>

<h2>The old style</h2>

<p>File names were presented as relative paths without further
modifications. This style relies on the Denote file-naming scheme to
narrow down the list by typing. For example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">202512</code> finds all files
with that in their identifier (i.e. their creation date by default),
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_emacs</code> finds all files with the given keyword, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-word</code> with that
word in their title.</p>

<h2>The new style</h2>

<p>The file names are still the same behind the scenes, but their data is
presented in a more readable way. There is no loss of functionality,
meaning that users can still match <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_keyword</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-title</code>, and the like,
per the Denote file-naming scheme.</p>

<h2>Part of development</h2>

<p>I might make further changes, though the idea is clear. Expect to get
similar features in my other packages, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal</code>.</p>

<p>For the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code> package, in particular, the file prompt it
uses shows sequences instead of identifiers as the prefix of each
file. This is because that prompt is relevant for tasks where the user
needs to know the exact sequence, such as when they create a note that
is the child of another.</p>

<p>Power users can study the functions stored in the variable
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-file-prompt-extra-metadata</code> (same idea for the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code> package: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence-file-prompt-extra-metadata</code>).</p>

<h2>About Denote</h2>

<p>Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea
that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming
scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is
about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically
streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to
link between them.</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>
