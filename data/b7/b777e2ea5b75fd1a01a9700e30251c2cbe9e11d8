<li>3 cables with 3 different magnetic attachments each: USB-C, micro-USB, and Lightning</li>
<li>They bend in the exact place where other cables break</li>
<li>Just for charging, not for data (we think)</li>
<li>Are they Mac-compatible: Buddy, they’re <em>everything</em> compatible</li>
</ul><h1>Just Useful</h1><p>What’s so special about these cables?</p>
<p>For starters, they know how to dance. Check it out:</p>

<p>Pretty killer moves, right?!</p>
<p>But seriously, this is one of those features that seems a little silly, until you actually think back and remember how many charging cables in your life have busted open at <em>that exact point</em>.</p>
<p>And that’s not the only way these things are flexible. Each one also comes with three magnetic tips: a lightning, a USB-C, and a micro-USB.</p>
<p>Look, don’t get us wrong. The old way? Of just having a basket full of, like, sixty assorted cables you had to go through whenever your ancient Kindle or your bike light needed a charge? It was fine, most of the time.</p>
<p>Were sixteen of those cables non-functional?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Did you put them back in the basket after testing them and realizing they no longer worked, thus ensuring a repeat of this process next time?</p>
<p>Also yes.</p>
<p>Still, it worked.</p>
<p>But remember, the saying from all those old infomercials isn’t, “There’s gotta be a way.” It’s, “There’s gotta be a <em>better</em> way.”</p>
<p>And that’s what this is: a 3-pack of better ways to charge different things with different ports.</p>
<p>So get them. You’ll definitely use them.</p>
