<p>We&#8217;ve all been there: you copy something important—a password, a snippet of code, that perfect turn of phrase—and then accidentally copy something else. Poof. Gone forever. It&#8217;s one of those small, daily frustrations that adds up over time.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s exactly why Quip caught my attention. It&#8217;s an AI-powered clipboard manager that remembers everything you copy, and it does it with the kind of thoughtful design that makes you wonder how you lived without it.</p>



<p>What sets Quip apart isn&#8217;t just that it stores your clipboard history (though it does that beautifully across Mac, iPhone, and iPad via iCloud sync). It&#8217;s the intelligence behind it. The app uses completely local AI to automatically clean up your clipboard—removing duplicate entries, normalizing text formatting, stripping tracking parameters from URLs, and even filtering out those random 2FA codes that would otherwise clutter your history.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been testing Quip for the past few weeks, and the &#8220;Super Shortcuts&#8221; feature alone has changed how I work. You can turn any clipboard item into a text expansion trigger. Type &#8220;sig&#8221; and your entire email signature appears. Type &#8220;bugfeedback&#8221; and that canned customer service response is ready to go. It&#8217;s like having TextExpander built right into your clipboard manager.</p>



<p>The OCR capability is particularly clever—hit ⌘⇧2 and you can capture text from presentations, locked PDFs, or even video calls. No more manually transcribing meeting notes from a shared screen.</p>



<p>Quip is built by BZG Apps, the same developer behind Unite 6 (which turns websites into native Mac apps), and you can tell they understand the Mac ecosystem. Everything feels native, from the keyboard shortcuts (all customizable) to the way it integrates with Continuity features.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re tired of losing important clipboard items or want to streamline your text expansion workflow, Quip is worth checking out. It starts at $19.99 for a standalone macOS license, with iOS and iPadOS apps included for the full ecosystem experience.</p>
