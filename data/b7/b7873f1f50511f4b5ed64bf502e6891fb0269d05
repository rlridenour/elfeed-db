<p>I saw someone online today saying they enjoyed
<a href="https://inventwithpython.com/pythongently/">Python Programming Exercises, Gently Explained</a>.</p>
<p>I went to the author&rsquo;s site and I saw that he makes all of his books
(Automate the Boring Stuff with Python and more) available for free at
<a href="https://inventwithpython.com/">https://inventwithpython.com/</a>. I&rsquo;d heard of his books many times before but I
didn&rsquo;t realize that he made them available on his site like that!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m Al Sweigart, and I write books to teach beginners to code. I put them
online for free because programming is too valuable and needs to be accessible
to all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always think it&rsquo;s so cool when authors do that, another example is Mark Dominus&rsquo;s <a href="https://hop.perl.plover.com/book/#PDF">Higher Order Perl</a></p>
