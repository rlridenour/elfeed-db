I've been feeling down lately. Most things, even computers, have seemed dull and meaningless. Maybe it's all the generative AI coverage in news that makes me have a bleak outlook on the future of technology. Waking up and seeing people hate on each other for stupid reasons on social media is also depressing. All the vile racism, hate against people who are part of the LGBT spectrum/community (or whatever the correct term is), hate against people who struggle etc. is not exactly uplifting. All of these combined turn into a torturous cacophony of hate and misery. Unsure on why I've been spending time on social media at all, but I guess my brain craved the dopamine rush that it's supposed to give. So I have been spending more time in the kitchen, and now with this weird poem of sorts. Consider it evening therapy&#x2026;
