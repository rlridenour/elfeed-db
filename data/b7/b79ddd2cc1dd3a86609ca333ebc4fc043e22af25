  <p>While we <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available/">previously announced</a> discontinuing support for all
goo.gl URLs after August 25, 2025, we’ve adjusted our approach in
order to preserve actively used links. We understand these links
are embedded in countless documents, videos, posts and more, and
we appreciate the input received.</p>

<p>Nine months ago, we redirected URLs that showed no activity in
late 2024 to a message specifying that the link would be
deactivated in August, and these are the only links targeted to be
deactivated. If you get a message that states, “This link will no
longer work in the near future”, the link won’t work after August
25 and we recommend transitioning to another URL shortener if you
haven’t already.</p>

<p>All other goo.gl links will be preserved and will continue to
function as normal. To check if your link will be retained, visit
the link today. If your link redirects you without a message, it
will continue to work.</p>

<p>Nice!</p>
