<p>    I presented <i>WAVEing at Repetitive Repetitive Repetitive Music</i> at <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/">EmacsConf 2020</a>. Video can be found at <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2020/talks/35/">this EmacsConf page</a>.</p><p>    If you enjoyed my talk, you might appreciate <a href="https://emacsnyc.org/">EmacsNYC</a>, a meetup I co-organize.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><blockquote>During quarantine, I found myself spending time with an Android app. One of the features this app has is composing music that loops endlessly. As with many things, I wondered how much better this feature would be, if only it was inside Emacs.    <br/>    <br/>    This talk explains how I made zmusic, my implementation inside Emacs, with detours through Emacs text properties, font rendering, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV"><code>WAVE</code> file format</a>, and music theory. And hopefully at the end, we'll have something worth listening to.</blockquote><h2>zmusic: Code & Presentation</h2><p>    The source can be found at <a href="https://hg.sr.ht/~zck/zmusic/">https://hg.sr.ht/~zck/zmusic/</a>.</p><p>    This presentation was performed in <a href="https://hg.sr.ht/~zck/zpresent">zpresent</a>, a presentation framework I wrote.
