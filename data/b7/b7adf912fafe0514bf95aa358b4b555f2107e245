</ul><h1>Cool It</h1><p>Jonny Pops. No, it’s not the name of a baseball player from a bygone era who somehow hit .390 despite drinking six Negronis in the dugout each game. It’s the brand name of a freezer pop maker. And today, we’re offering some of their stuff!</p>
<p>Well, actually, that’s an understatement.</p>
<p>We’re offering a 48-pack of their stuff. As in: twelve pounds of freezer pops in cherry and mixed berry flavors. For $15.</p>
<p>So, like 30 cents per pop.</p>
<p>Pretty good, right?</p>
<p>You know what else is pretty good? The ingredients.</p>
<p>There are no added sugars, artificial dyes, flavors, or any of the nine most common allergens (milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soybeans, and sesame). But, more to the point, these things are made with 100% organic fruit juice, and each one “contains ½ cup of fruit, aligning with USDA Smart Snack standards.”</p>
<p>In other words, it’s a great snack for kids!</p>
<p>The only problem? Some children possess a preternatural ability to sniff out things with real nutritional value so that they can turn up their noses at them in favor of something that’s basically an amalgamation of high fructose corn syrup, preservatives, and some food coloring.</p>
<p>So, it can be risky.</p>
<p>With all that being said, consider the snack at hand: freezer pops.</p>
<p>If it’s time to crack out the freezer pops, that means it’s hot outside. Your kids have been running around all day. They’re exhausted, they’re sun-sick, and they’re likely dehydrated to a dangerous degree. You could give them anything, and so long as it’s cold and vaguely sweet, they’ll love it.</p>
<p>Besides, who says freezer pops are only for kids? You could buy this 48-pack and enjoy all of them yourself. And hey, maybe all the real fruit in there will make them more appealing to your adult palate!</p>
<p>You know, as if grown-ups can’t enjoy sugary treats.</p>
<p>Look, the point is: it’s hot as hell outside, so buy a bunch of freezer pops for not a bunch of money.</p>
