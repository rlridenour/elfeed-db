<p>A million million spermatozoa,<br />
All of them alive;<br />
Out of their cataclysm but one poor Noah<br />
Dare hope to survive.</p>
<p>And among that billion minus one<br />
Might have chanced to be<br />
Shakespeare, another Newton, a new Donne &#8212;<br />
But the One was Me.</p>
<p>Shame to have ousted your betters thus,<br />
Taking ark while the others remained outside!<br />
Better for all of us, froward Homunculus,<br />
If you&#8217;d quietly died!</p>
<p>&#8212; Aldous Huxley</p>
