<p>At last — a bespoke plain text flashcard solution I actually <em>want</em> to use, <em>and</em> am consistently using!</p>
<p>Mine lives in Workflowy, which counts as plain text in my book because of automated daily email backups and regular manual Markdown exports. It also works in <span class="small-caps">VS</span> Code, and indeed in any app that allows folding sections <em>and</em> can remember the fold state.</p>
<p>The approach I’ve embraced is similar to the one Kyle Jones describes in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQl-6WrNNvg" target="_blank">video</a>, but without the Workflowy-only features he has integrated into his flashcards. Both Kyle and I used the advice in <a href="https://ncase.me/remember/" target="_blank">this illustrated website</a> as our starting point.</p>
<p>A full write-up is in the works, including when you might want to choose Obsidian over Workflowy, and how to get audio files from WhatsApp into Workflowy without needing to convert the file (easy, but not obvious).</p>
<p>My <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/068-markdown-flashcards-no-plugins">plugin-free one-card-per-file Obsidian method</a> still works beautifully but I’ve been oddly reluctant to engage with it on a daily basis. Perhaps because I overcomplicated the process by including a lot of unnecessary metadata? Or because it’s nice having a dedicated space for this activity?</p>
<p>Anyway, the Workflowy setup also works in Obsidian, with all cards in the one file. I love having options!</p>
<p>I’m really chuffed with this way of using flashcards because it’s hands-on, simple, portable, and it <em>works</em>. I feel more in tune with the learning process than I ever did with dedicated, locked-in flashcard apps, and can already see it helping me gain and retain knowledge over the long term.</p>
