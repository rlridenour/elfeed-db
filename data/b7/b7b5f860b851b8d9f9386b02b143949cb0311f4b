<p id="p2">Ever since <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bb.wavelengths.online" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brendon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/johnvoorhees.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">John</a>, and I started our podcast about portable gaming &ndash; <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPC: Next Portable Console</a> &ndash; last year, I knew I&rsquo;d found something special. It&rsquo;s not just that the three of us are obsessed with handhelds and portable consoles; it&rsquo;s that we work well together, and we&rsquo;re having <em>so much fun</em> doing the show every two weeks. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to do even more with a project they love?</p>
<p id="p3">So today, we&rsquo;re announcing some big changes to NPC:</p>
<ul id="ul4"><li>We&rsquo;re taking the regular show <strong>weekly</strong>, for free, for everyone!</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re introducing <strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/NextPortableConsole" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPC XL</a></strong>, a members-only version of NPC with extra content, available exclusively through our new Patreon for $5/month.</li>
<li>NPC is getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NPCNextPortableConsole" rel="noopener noreferrer">its own YouTube channel</a>. With an expansion of the show, it made sense to let it grow beyond the MacStories YouTube channel.</li>
<li>NPC is joining the (awesome) <a href="https://discord.gg/xQ7ht3V" rel="noopener noreferrer">TWG Discord server</a> with a dedicated channel for community feedback and participation.</li>
</ul><p id="p5">You can <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/NextPortableConsole" rel="noopener noreferrer">find our Patreon here</a>, and we also dropped a surprise episode of NPC today announcing the expansion of the show:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper" id="div6"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQCo1BoxyrU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></div>
<p id="p7">Now, allow me to spend a few more words on why we&rsquo;re doing this and what you can expect from becoming a patron of NPC XL.</p>

<h2 id="npc-xl-deeper-topics-just-for-patrons">NPC XL: Deeper Topics, Just for Patrons</h2>
<p id="p9">It&rsquo;s no secret that the ad market has been terrible for independent creators like us over the past year or so. Thus, we&rsquo;ve decided to follow the same approach that has worked pretty well for <a href="https://club.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Club MacStories</a> for the past decade:</p>
<p id="p10">We&rsquo;re going to work hard to provide listeners with <strong>extra content every week</strong>, and you can support us directly for doing so.</p>
<p id="p11">We have a proven track record of making this model work on a weekly basis with no interruptions. Since we launched Club MacStories in September 2015, we&rsquo;ve delivered over 450 weekly newsletters and 110 monthly ones. With NPC XL, we&rsquo;re going to follow the same approach: we&rsquo;ll produce a separate version of the show every week, and we&rsquo;ll charge for it.</p>
<p id="p12">I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the idea that &ndash; now more than ever &ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s essential to support your favorite creators whenever possible. At the same time, I know that in an increasingly competitive market filled with subscriptions, AI-generated &ldquo;blogs&rdquo; and &ldquo;podcasts&rdquo;, and hundreds of newsletters, we have to earn people&rsquo;s trust, attention, and financial contribution. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve been planning NPC XL for months, and I think we&rsquo;ve landed on something special that will be fun and useful for everyone involved.</p>
<p id="p13">Besides going weekly, the NPC you know and love is not going to change. Each week, we&rsquo;ll have our usual news recaps to make sense of the ever-changing handheld world, mini segments, and topics. The show will come out weekly on Tuesdays and be delivered both as a traditional podcast and a video on YouTube.</p>
<p id="p14">For NPC XL, we&rsquo;ll record a special segment or deep dive about a particular topic to be released alongside the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; NPC episode. NPC XL will be a separate podcast feed with separate patron-only videos. Think of it as an addendum to NPC: extra content with a business model that &ndash; with your contribution &ndash; will allow us to research more in-depth topics and tinker with even more devices.</p>

<p id="p16">For the debut episode of NPC XL, we&rsquo;ve prepared a deep dive into the magical world of PSP hardware with a historical PSP retrospective. Researching this topic has been a blast, and I can&rsquo;t wait for people to listen to it. Looking ahead at the next few months of NPC XL, we have a wide variety of special patron-only topics already in the works, and I&rsquo;m <em>very</em> excited to get to work on these.</p>
<p id="p17">If you&rsquo;ve followed the evolution of NPC and the crazy things we like to do for this show, I think you can get an idea of what to expect. After all, we&rsquo;re the same people who had a custom <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/federicos-updated-setup-is-designed-for-modular-simplicity/" rel="noopener noreferrer">eGPU</a> made and shipped from Las Vegas to Rome, acquired a handful of PSPs twenty years after the console&rsquo;s release, put <a href="https://youtu.be/bcBp7-Phl34" rel="noopener noreferrer">a cage on a Legion Go</a>, and so forth. Now, you get a chance to actively contribute to this insanity.</p>
<h2 id="see-you-on-patreon">See You on Patreon</h2>
<p id="p18">I&rsquo;m thrilled to begin this new adventure with John and Brendon. Working in the gaming industry was a childhood dream of mine, and although my life path took me in a different direction with MacStories, I feel like a part of that dream is now coming true with NPC XL.</p>
<p id="p19">We&rsquo;re doing this. I hope you&rsquo;ll <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/NextPortableConsole" rel="noopener noreferrer">join us for the ride</a>.</p>
