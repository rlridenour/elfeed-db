<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said an upcoming ruling party congress, expected in early February, will lay out “next-stage” steps to strengthen the country’s nuclear deterrent. The statements followed fresh weapons tests that South Korea said included multiple short-range ballistic missile launches toward the Sea of Japan, while North Korea described a test of an upgraded large-caliber multiple rocket launcher system. Kim framed the buildup as a response to perceived external threats and joint military activity by the United States and its allies, while signaling the congress will also address broader development priorities alongside defense. For the wider region, the immediate hope is that clearer signals—however tense—can create openings for diplomacy and reduce miscalculation as neighbors track Pyongyang’s next moves.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/vSmrxKuU33TALA1nXYEfem9cwL0DrclpHipuCOkDr3ghVyB0DLhkUp57_pbQW46mtvKMyg0-qACkLsuSuO8DEQyTlXwarPOgOSze-iorBD_cWvHwm_S2i-NIKqjccz89bf0DeNgNcb7IFpqTnHYurpo8ZzhYsuHZhGWsqmEehw' alt='File image used with ABC’s wire report on Kim’s planned congress agenda.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Test details: North Korea said rockets from the upgraded MLRS hit a target about 358.5 km offshore and highlighted a “self-steered precisely guided flight system” intended to improve accuracy.</li><li>Family appearance: Kim observed the test alongside his daughter Ju-ae, according to KCNA as cited by RT.</li><li>Seoul detection: South Korea’s military reported detecting several short-range ballistic missiles launched from north of Pyongyang toward the Sea of Japan the day before North Korea’s MLRS announcement.</li><li>Economic agenda: Ahead of the congress, Pyongyang is also expected to present a five-year development plan covering the economy as well as defense, Al Jazeera reported.</li><li>Regional timing: The test coincided with a visit to South Korea by US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby, where discussions included Seoul’s plans to build nuclear-powered submarines, according to RT.</li></ul><blockquote>This gathering &quot;will clarify the next-stage plans for further bolstering the country’s nuclear deterrence.&quot; - Kim Jong Un</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>North Korean leadership: Kim said the forthcoming party congress will set out plans to further bolster North Korea’s nuclear deterrent and framed recent tests as strengthening strategic deterrence.
