<blockquote><p>
Socrates wants to cross a river and comes to a bridge guarded by Plato. The two speak as follows:</p>
<p>Plato: &#8216;Socrates, if in the first proposition which you utter, you speak the truth, I will permit you to cross. But surely, if you speak falsely, I shall throw you into the water.&#8217;</p>
<p>Socrates: &#8216;You will throw me into the water.&#8217;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Jean Buridan posed this conundrum in his <em>Sophismata</em> in the 14th century. Like a similar paradox in <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2008/02/21/hung-jury/"><em>Don Quixote</em></a>, it seems to leave the guardian in an impossible position &#8212; whether Socrates speaks truly or falsely, it would seem, the promise cannot be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Some readers offered a wry solution: Wait until he&#8217;s crossed the bridge, and <em>then</em> throw him in.</p>
