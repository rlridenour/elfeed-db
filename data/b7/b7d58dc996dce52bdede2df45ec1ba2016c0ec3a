<p>French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a letter of intent in Paris on Monday to provide Ukraine with up to 100 French-made Rafale fighter jets and associated weaponry, with deliveries envisaged over a ten-year horizon. The broader package also covers air-defence systems, precision munitions, drones and radars, and France says part of the financing could come from a plan to use frozen Russian assets with hoped-for EU support. Some Ukrainian officials and commentators criticised the long delivery timeline and raised concerns about immediate operational needs amid a corruption scandal at home; France framed the deal as a long-term commitment to help regenerate Ukraine’s forces. Russia condemned the announcement and warned of risks, making the move a significant geopolitical signal from Paris toward Kyiv.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/-zOKPI4BwTBXHemEcFvl7ue2_KzbncaDYM29cvl-WG6R__764Oc_fAmiNz6Bat5aE8KvMzzjBEHEBxsHB2j2ZEd9cU-aRCdS58pZSdhFqf5w-aARbxAKXsO-H3HFRPm0dr-hf0V-IFvkCgI7odMUoGQpKJZ4YPezcMoK4Aj8yGUeYDFaY5kD-TeYjAczmtH5vVXYK9e1' alt='François Bayrou, top left, then the prime minister of France, with a Rafale fighter aircraft in June; France said it would sell up to 100 such jets to Ukraine.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Financing plan: French officials and others have proposed using frozen Russian assets and EU backing to help finance the purchases, a mechanism referenced by both governments and discussed in Brussels.</li><li>What’s included: Beyond jets, the agreement&#x27;s scope covers next‑generation SAMP/T air‑defence batteries, AASM Hammer precision munitions, drones and French-made radars, reflecting a layered approach to Ukraine’s air defence needs.</li><li>Domestic reaction: Some Ukrainian voices criticised the ten-year delivery horizon as too slow for battlefield needs, and the announcement comes while Kyiv faces a high-profile domestic corruption scandal that has complicated public support.</li><li>European angle: Analysts say the deal signals a shift toward European-led military support — France hopes the package will &#x27;lock&#x27; a decade-long strategic relationship and partly fill gaps left by waning US engagement.</li></ul><blockquote>A historic deal - Volodymyr Zelensky</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine (Volodymyr Zelensky): Zelensky hailed the agreement as a strategic, &quot;historic&quot; deal that will strengthen Ukraine&#x27;s defence over the long term.
