<p>Back in December, you hopefully thoroughly immersed yourself in&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.openculture.com/2016/12/the-map-of-physics.html">The Map of Physics</a></em>, an animated video–a visual aid for the&nbsp;modern age–that mapped out the field of physics, explaining all the connections between classical physics, quantum physics, and relativity.</p>
<p>You can’t do physics without math. Hence we now have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y"><em>The Map of Mathematics</em></a>. Created by&nbsp;physicist&nbsp;<a href="http://dominicwalliman.com/">Dominic Walliman</a>, this video explains “how pure mathematics and applied mathematics relate to each other and all of the sub-topics they are made from.” Watch the new video above. You can <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman/works/25095968-the-map-of-mathematics" rel="nofollow">buy a poster of the map here</a>. And you can <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/32264483720/in/dateposted-public/">download a version for educational use here</a>.</p>
