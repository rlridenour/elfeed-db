<p>Apart from <a href="https://www.openculture.com/?p=1123100">certain stretches of absence</a>, Leonardo’s <em>Mona Lisa</em> has been on display at the Louvre for 228 years and counting.&nbsp;Though created by an Italian in Italy, the painting has long since been a part of French culture.&nbsp;At some point, the reverence for<em> La Joconde</em>, as the&nbsp;<em>Mona Lisa</em> is locally known, reached such an intensity as to inspire the label <em>Jocondisme</em>. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a>, it all seems to have been a bit much.&nbsp;In 1919, he bought a postcard bearing the image of that most famous of all paintings, drew a mustache and goatee on it, and dubbed the resulting “artwork” <em>L.H.O.O.Q.</em>, whose French pronunciation&nbsp;“<em>Elle a chaud au cul</em>” translates to — as Duchamp modestly put it — “There is fire down below.”</p>

<p>A century ago, this was a highly irreverent, even blasphemous act, but also just what one might expect from the man who, a couple years earlier, <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2024/08/how-marcel-duchamp-signed-a-urinal-in-1917-redefined-art.html">signed a urinal and put it on display in a gallery.</a>&nbsp;Like the much-scrutinized <em>Fountain</em>, <em>L.H.O.O.Q.&nbsp;</em>was one of Duchamp’s “readymades,” or artistic provocations executed by modifying and re-contextualizing found objects.</p>

<p>Neither was singular: just as Duchamp signed multiple urinals, he also drew (or didn’t draw) facial hair on multiple <em>Mona Lisa&nbsp;</em>postcards. In one instance, he even gave the okay to his fellow artist&nbsp;Francis Picabia to make one for publication in his magazine in New York as, nevertheless, “par Marcel Duchamp” — though it lacked a goatee, an omission the artist corrected in his own hand some twenty years later.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wuf_GHmjxLM">the 1956 interview just above</a>, Duchamp describes <em>L.H.O.O.Q.&nbsp;</em>as a part of his “<a href="https://www.openculture.com/2016/07/dada-was-born-100-years-ago.html">Dada</a> period” (and, with characteristic modesty, “a great iconoclastic gesture on my part”). He also brings out a fake check — belonging to “no bank at all” — that he created to use at the dentist (who accepted it); and a system designed to “break the bank at Monte Carlo” (which stubbornly remained unbroken). “I believe that art is the only form of activity in which man, as a man, shows himself to be a true individual, and is capable of going beyond the animal state,” he declares. With his collision of <em>Jocondisme&nbsp;</em>and Dada, among the other unlikely juxtapositions he engineered, he showed himself to be the premier prankster of early twentieth-century art — and one whose pranks transcended amusement to inspire a scholarly industry that persists even today.</p>
