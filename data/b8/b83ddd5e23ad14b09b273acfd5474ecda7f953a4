<p>Sony, in a 2021 Instagram post, regarding the uniforms <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CT2STaKlJbM/?hl=en&amp;img_index=2">that so infatuated Steve Jobs</a> that he commissioned Miyake to design prototype vests for Apple employees to wear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The history of the relationship between the two companies dates
back to the 1980s. It was Issey Miyake whom Akio Morita, chairman
of the board at that time, requested for a uniform design which
employees take pride in with comfort year-round.</p>

<p>That’s the light nylon fabric uniform, created by the first
collaboration of Sony and ISSEY MIYAKE.</p>

<p>Featuring removable sleeves, it’s perfect for summer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second photo shows Akio Morita trying one on. See also: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C1E-z9FPnVi/">this Instagram post from SPOT Closet</a>.</p>

<p>What a find it would be for someone to uncover one of Miyake’s prototype vests for Apple.</p>
