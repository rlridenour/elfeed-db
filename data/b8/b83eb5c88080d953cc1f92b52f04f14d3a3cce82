<p>President Trump told reporters on Monday that the United States will sell F-35 stealth fighter jets to Saudi Arabia ahead of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Washington visit, a move the White House frames as deepening the defence partnership between the two countries. U.S. officials say the visit could include signing a framework for civilian nuclear cooperation as Riyadh seeks advanced technology to diversify its energy mix, but any full nuclear accord and high-end arms sale are likely to face close scrutiny from Congress. Analysts and officials warn the sale would shift regional military balance calculations and test U.S. commitments to maintain Israel’s qualitative military edge in the Middle East.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RwLYXhUSs1HzeTv7_fgUtq3NfBGijwthL0MDm_96cwrQk2CGbFQPB1VQ-uK89lgZM2EqlAJEcaTYwIi2MRNWtInDwu2wSQu9u30KRWmF1Wkdpth2pRF6eJrQ3uFs1TlU00xttTWu4XYLcPJaTsTOhELuZ6OPgynpXahEuni0a24fht7RRORUo-3f2gKDC07y1lzBvwosjiwSj3NBBHJvNTwldOpgm4b_hSXIQ3D5hLNBZdiXDrQk9I-0kqd06YzApsKspLlIqvK3qRsXyQ' alt='President Trump shakes hands with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a welcoming ceremony in Riyadh in May 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Numbers requested: Saudi Arabia has sought as many as 48 F-35 fighters, and U.S. officials say the proposal cleared a key Pentagon policy hurdle ahead of the visit</li><li>Export precedent: Washington has so far limited F-35 exports to close allies and removed Turkey from the program in 2019 after its purchase of a Russian air-defence system, setting a precedent for strict export controls</li><li>Conditions expected: Some U.S. officials and analysts expect Congress to press for conditions—such as Saudi normalization with Israel—before approving any final F-35 sale or an expanded nuclear pact</li><li>Ceremonial welcome: The crown prince’s White House visit is expected to include state-like honours—reports mention a fly-by, cannon salute and gala-style events—as part of an effort to showcase business and defence deals</li></ul><blockquote>We will be doing that.
