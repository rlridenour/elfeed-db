  <p>Alarms and timers are now harder to dismiss thanks to a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/06/ios-26-1-beta-2-makes-alarms-harder-to-accidentally-dismiss/">new
‘Slide to stop’ gesture</a>. Both alarms and timers were
updated in iOS 26 to utilize a new design with much larger
on-screen buttons than before. Now in iOS 26.1 beta 2, Apple has
replaced the ‘Stop’ button with a new sliding gesture that
requires a little more intentionality. This should make accidental
alarm dismissals more rare.</p>

<p>That’s one of several changes that caught my eye. Seems like a great idea. Another notable change: <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/ipados-26-1-beta-brings-back-slide-over-adds-microphone-adjustments/">Slide Over returns to iPadOS</a>.</p>
