<p>In 1988, traversing synonyms in the <em>Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary</em>, A. Ross Eckler found his way from TRUE to FALSE:</p>
<p>TRUE-JUST-FAIR-BEAUTIFUL-PRETTY-ARTFUL-ARTIFICIAL-SHAM-FALSE</p>
<p>He found his way back again by a different route:</p>
<p>FALSE-UNWISE-FOOLISH-SIMPLE-UNCONDITIONAL-ABSOLUTE-POSITIVE­-REAL-GENUINE-TRUE</p>
<p>He was using the dictionary&#8217;s ninth edition; see the article below for his conventions regarding qualifying synonyms. Two more examples:</p>
<p>BAD-POOR-MEAN-PENURIOUS-STINGY-CLOSE-SECRET-FURTIVE-SLY-CUNNING-CLEVER-GOOD</p>
<p>GOOD-CLEVER-CUNNING-SLY-FURTIVE-SECRET-TICKLISH-CRITICAL-ACUTE-SHARP-HARSH-ROUGH-INDELICATE-INDECOROUS-IMPROPER-INCORRECT-WRONG-SINFUL-WICKED-EVIL-BAD</p>
<p>LIGHT-BRIGHT-CLEVER-CUNNING-SLY-FURTIVE-SECRET-HIDDEN-OBSCURE-DARK</p>
<p>DARK-OBSCURE-VAGUE-VACANT-EMPTY-FOOLISH-SIMPLE-EASY-LIGHT</p>
<p>Somewhat related: Lewis Carroll invented word ladders, in which one transforms one word into another by changing one letter at a time:</p>
<p>COLD-CORD-WORD-WARD-WARM</p>
<p>Each intermediate step must itself be an English word. Donald Knuth once used a computer to find links among 5,757 common five-letter English words. 671 of these, he found, were not connected to any other word in the collection. These he dubbed &#8220;aloof&#8221; &#8212; and noted that ALOOF itself is such a word.</p>
