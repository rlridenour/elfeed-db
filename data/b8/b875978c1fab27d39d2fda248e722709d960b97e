<p>Victorian riddler (and Bishop of Winchester) Samuel Wilberforce offered this conundrum:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I have a large Box, with two lids, two caps, three established Measures, and a great number of articles a Carpenter cannot do without. &#8211; Then I have always by me a couple of good Fish, and a number of a smaller tribe, &#8211; besides two lofty Trees, fine Flowers, and the fruit of an indigenous Plant; a handsome Stag; two playful animals; and a number of a smaller and less tame Herd: &#8211; Also two Halls, or Places of Worship; some Weapons of warfare; and many Weathercocks: &#8211; The Steps of an Hotel; The House of Commons on the eve of a Dissolution; Two Students or Scholars, and some Spanish Grandees, to wait upon me.</p>
<p>All pronounce me a wonderful piece of Mechanism, but few have numbered up the strange medley of things which compose my whole.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Lewis Carroll seems to have loved it &#8212; he circulated copies to his friends and published this solution in 1866:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The Whole &#8212; is Man.</p>
<p>The Parts are as follows.</p>
<p>A large Box &#8212; The Chest.<br />
Two lids &#8212; The Eye lids.<br />
Two Caps &#8212; The Knee Caps.<br />
Three established Measures &#8212; The nails, hands and feet.<br />
A great number of articles a Carpenter cannot do without, &#8212; Nails.<br />

Two lofty Trees &#8212; The Palms (of the hands).<br />

A handsome Stag &#8212; The Heart. (Hart).<br />
