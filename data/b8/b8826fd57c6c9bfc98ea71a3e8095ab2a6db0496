<p>I have a problem with news consumption. I want to stay informed about what&#8217;s happening in the world, but I don&#8217;t want it to absorb my entire day. More importantly, I&#8217;m tired of the slant. Every major news outlet seems to have an agenda, and I find myself spending more time filtering editorial bias than actually learning what happened.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;ve been looking for a way to get a neutral, comprehensive news briefing without the time sink. That&#8217;s a tall order, but Kagi&#8217;s new product <a href="https://kite.kagi.com/about">Kagi News</a> might actually deliver on it.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Kagi, they&#8217;re the folks behind the paid search engine that doesn&#8217;t track you or show ads. I <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/809">interviewed Kagi&#8217;s founder on Mac Power Users</a> and found him to be an insightful and sincere guy. They&#8217;ve built a reputation for respecting users&#8217; time and attention, so when they launched a news app, I paid attention.</p>



<p>Kagi News takes a fundamentally different approach. Instead of an endless feed that updates constantly throughout the day, you get one comprehensive press review delivered at 12:00 UTC. That&#8217;s it. One daily briefing designed to be consumed in about five minutes.</p>



<p>The system reads thousands of community-curated RSS feeds from publications around the world and uses AI to synthesize them into digestible summaries. Each story includes a summary, highlights, key quotes, a timeline, context, and potential impact. If you want to dive deeper, there&#8217;s a one-tap link to the original source. It&#8217;s aggregation, not editorial.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been testing Kagi News and I&#8217;m cautiously optimistic. The once-daily update means I&#8217;m not constantly checking for new stories. I open the app in the morning, spend five minutes getting caught up, and move on with my day. That alone is a huge win.</p>



<p>If <strong>you</strong> want to stay informed without the doomscrolling, Kagi News is worth trying. It won&#8217;t replace in-depth reading on topics you care deeply about, but as a daily briefing to keep you generally informed, it&#8217;s solid.</p>



<p>The app is free to download and use. You can get it from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kagi-news/id6748314243">App Store</a> or access it <a href="https://kite.kagi.com/">on the web</a>.</p>
