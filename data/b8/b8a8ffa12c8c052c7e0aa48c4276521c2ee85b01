<p>When I don’t feel well I often reach for the TV remote. Nothing piqued, so I took a flyer on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_(TV_series)">Plur1bus</a>. My general disinterest in the selection explains why I accidentally played episode three first.</p>
<p>Episode three was so much better than episodes one and two. And as an introduction to the world it excelled. The spareness and pacing surprised me, more so in retrospect.</p>
