Literate Programing and snippets The Problem: orgmode literate programing is incompatible with orgmode snippets Submitted to the orgmode mailing list1 and to reddit2.
I have enjoyed using Orgmode for literate programming3 for years. I have a script that runs whenever there is a change to the file(s), retangling every tangle src block in the whole file. Just now I&rsquo;ve finally acted to encode my snippets in my literate setup. For anyone unaware, snippets (I use yasnippet4) are shortcut keystrokes that transform into more elaborate text when used.
