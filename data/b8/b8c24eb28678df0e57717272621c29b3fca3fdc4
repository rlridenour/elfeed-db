As a programmer, I know that <a href="https://www.gnu.org/s/grep/manual/grep.html">grep</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html">sed</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html">awk</a> are powerful for processing text, but they sometimes aren&#39;t that straight-forward for specific tasks, as I need to think about how to filter the lines and the columns out.</p>
<p>
So I wonder if there is a handy way to do these tasks?</p>
<p>
After using it for a while, I think using regex directly can help, so I launched a <a href="https://texttoolkit.com/re.findall">re.findall service</a> building on top of Python <code class="verbatim">re.findall</code> API.</p>
