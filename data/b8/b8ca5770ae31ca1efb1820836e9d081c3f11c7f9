<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has, for now, headed off a Labour Party push to remove him after a fast-moving crisis sparked by renewed scrutiny of Jeffrey Epstein’s links with Peter Mandelson. The revelations have also reignited criticism of Starmer’s decision to appoint Mandelson as ambassador to the United States despite Mandelson’s past relationship with Epstein. Two senior members of Starmer’s team resigned amid the fallout, but Cabinet ministers urged unity and Starmer kept enough support to avoid an immediate leadership challenge. Polling commissioned by POLITICO suggests his standing with the public is still fragile: 52% of respondents said he should resign, while 19% said he should stay but that his advisers should go.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/kY5-7sMSxfTIgBg-hBEN1WmDvWmjCjasXHrCnyPc95NWnhjGUvAxO2bNrjXfSPtcUmnOAC3evSWkuZqb1TaXBAU-b7jofPsZKlemCQGFrZeg_gOAtEWeL-n5H9-a-EBjZRFwF0Ucypipch5ZReNdpGAsL-Ad-9sld2hyh6x2cwkxv45N7N5Ryl3nfpjTQnHvvP_Bet0' alt='UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer pictured during the political fallout over the Epstein-linked controversy.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Beyond Mandelson: Among those who wanted resignations, 47% said they had reasons beyond the Mandelson scandal for wanting a change in leadership.</li><li>Cabinet backstop: POLITICO reported Starmer’s Cabinet quickly rallied behind him, narrowing the room for a coordinated attempt to force him out.</li><li>A wider peril: Firstpost argued the Epstein fallout could become Starmer’s “Truss moment,” framing it as a fight for survival amid a deepening cost-of-living crunch and growing fractures inside No. 10.</li><li>Sarwar ‘going it alone’: POLITICO said Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar’s public call for Starmer to resign did not immediately bring other senior figures with him, draining momentum from an ouster bid.</li><li>Media scrutiny: Novara Media described Starmer as seeking MPs’ forgiveness as pressure continued, reflecting anger among parts of the party and the activist base.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Keir Starmer: Starmer said he would not resign, arguing that staying in office means honoring the mandate he received, after days of scrutiny over Mandelson’s past links to Epstein.
