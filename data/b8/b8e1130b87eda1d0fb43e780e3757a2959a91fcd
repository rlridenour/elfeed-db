<br/>
Shoppers should note that this sale is focused on colors of the Braided Solo Loop and Solo Loop that Apple has stopped selling, and it doesn't include any of the new band colors. That being said, all of the bands in this sale are in new condition.<br/>
<br/>
The entire sale is focused on Solo Loop and Braided Solo Loop Apple Watch bands, so you'll need to know the size that works best for you before you buy. Apple has a measurement tool <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MFTL4AM/A/40mm-neon-yellow-solo-loop-size-0">on its website</a> that you can use to determine your exact size.<br/>
