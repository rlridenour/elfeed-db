<blockquote>
  <p>In 2009, Apple sold more iPhones than it did in 2007 and 2008
combined. In 2010, Apple sold more iPhones than it did in 2007,
2008, and 2009 combined. Last year, Apple sold 93.1 million
iPhones, slightly more than it did in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010
combined. The <a href="https://www.mattrichman.net/another-way-of-looking-at-iphone-sales/">pattern</a> continued.</p>

<p>I referenced this old post <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/14/meta-claims-glasses-surging">earlier today</a>, attempting to put into context Meta’s “leak” that they’ve got <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/185832/donald-trump-roasted-concepts-plan">concepts of a plan</a> to ramp Meta Glasses production up to 20 million units per year. It’s easy to forget — or if you’re young enough, to just accept as history — just how astonishing the growth of the iPhone was in its early years. Every year wasn’t just bigger than the previous year — it was bigger than all previous years combined. Year after year. That pattern only ended after Apple had run out of new countries, new carriers, and new customers to introduce it to.</p>

<p>There’s never been a product like it before, and quite possibly never will be again. In January 2007 no one had ever even seen a device like an iPhone. By 2015 or so, almost everyone in the world who could afford one either had an iPhone or they had an Android phone that looked and worked like an iPhone.</p>
