Despite the ongoing focus in the industry on generative artificial intelligence, Apple is reportedly planning to debut a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">complete visual redesign</a> of its platforms as "the highlight of the show" at WWDC. The updated design language includes translucent interface elements and menus that echo the visual style of visionOS. While the new design was rumored for iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16, it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/26/tvos-19-watchos-12-design-changes-rumor/">now expected</a> to extend to tvOS 19 and watchOS 12 too. The changes mark the most comprehensive cross-platform visual update since the introduction of iOS 7 in 2013.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also apparently shifting its software versioning system from sequential numbers to a year-based format, similar to how car manufacturers label vehicle model years. Instead of releasing iOS 19 and macOS 16, Apple will debut <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS 26</a>, along with iPadOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">reports</a> that this change is intended to reduce confusion for users and developers by aligning version numbers across platforms and matching them to the upcoming calendar year.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to these design and branding changes, Apple is said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/apple-ios-19-gaming-app/">developing a new standalone gaming app</a> that will be introduced at WWDC. The app is intended to replace Game Center and will offer a unified platform for launching games, tracking achievements, social features, viewing leaderboards, and accessing editorial content. The app is purportedly designed to support both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> titles and third-party games currently distributed through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. On macOS, the app will also be able to detect and organize games installed outside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-app-store/">Mac App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The gaming app represents Apple's most overt emphasis on gaming infrastructure since the launch of &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; in 2019. While Apple has historically treated Game Center as a background service rather than a user-facing platform, this new app appears to be aimed at making game discovery and engagement more prominent across devices. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.<br/>
