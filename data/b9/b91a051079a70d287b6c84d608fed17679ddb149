<blockquote><p>
The Moscow Radio announced that five million Russians filed past Josef Stalin&#8217;s bier in 72 hours. That means, according to the calculations of Frank Baker, a Mangum, Okla., accountant, that the mourners, two abreast, three and one third feet apart, ran past the bier at 22 miles an hour. Twenty-two miles an hour is 9.3 seconds a hundred yards, which is the world&#8217;s record for the 100-yard dash &#8212; heretofore recorded only by America&#8217;s Mel Patton.
