<p>A Bangladeshi tribunal on November 17, 2025, sentenced former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to death in absentia after finding her guilty of crimes against humanity for a violent crackdown on a student-led uprising that toppled her government last year. Hasina has been living in self-exile in India since fleeing Bangladesh in August last year, and Dhaka has urged New Delhi to extradite her — a request that analysts say will test bilateral ties. The U.N. said the verdict was an important step for victims but expressed regret over the imposition of the death penalty. The sentence could reshape Bangladesh’s political landscape ahead of elections scheduled for February 2026, according to regional commentators.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/1pirCHGi_SXvx8No_Lvg9GFBxxQjSokISILj4daryN655hZn6iq8AG64sClZHOW4WYJzN4eECv7yBS07KgYFv8jmW921TPyobas1GAV4YL0bW75SrED2Xncnik7MuJO5Kcx8U9Fyg5CLAKW5OBLiiPKJPnN9_FNALdXCmBds_pAiCON_rK0H9kb9N68wZTY4nVrcpip1CiAoaa069kwDieGEiZuIH_vy' alt='Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s former prime minister, in Dhaka last year.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Reported casualties: Sources reporting on last year’s crackdown say as many as 1,400 people died during the unrest that followed the student protests.</li><li>Co-defendants: The tribunal also sentenced Hasina’s former home minister, Asaduzzaman Khan, to death in absentia alongside her, according to wire reports.</li><li>Extradition hurdles: Legal experts note India can refuse extradition requests when a death sentence is involved and that New Delhi’s close political ties with Hasina complicate any forced return.</li><li>Political implications: Observers warn the verdict may alter campaigning and party dynamics ahead of February 2026 elections by deepening divisions and changing opposition strategy.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Bangladesh interim government: Dhaka has urged India to extradite Hasina to face the sentence in Bangladesh, calling for accountability after last year’s crackdown.
