<p id="p2">While most of the new features announced at WWDC today are coming to Apple&rsquo;s major OSes, the AirPods weren&rsquo;t completely left out of the fun. Today, <a href="https://nr.apple.com/Dt5e4N9xk3" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple revealed a couple of enhancements</a> coming to the AirPods line this fall.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://longplay.rocks" rel="noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer">Longplay:</a></strong> The home for your albums. Now on iOS, coming soon to macOS. Get Early Access.</p>
</aside><p id="p4">First up is a new camera remote feature. Users will soon be able to take a photo or start a video recording in the Camera app and compatible third-party apps on the iPhone and iPad by pressing and holding on the stem of their AirPods. If a video is already being recorded, a press-and-hold gesture will end the recording. This will be a nice replacement for the camera timer when you&rsquo;re taking a group photo, and it will also come in handy for many online creators.</p>

<p id="p6">The other big addition to AirPods this fall will be what Apple calls &ldquo;studio-quality audio recording.&rdquo; The company has improved the quality of audio recordings as well as call quality on H2-powered AirPods, saying that this enhancement combined with Voice Isolation makes the AirPods a tool that can be used by podcasters, musicians, and interviewers.</p>
<p id="p7">I&rsquo;m interested to see how these features fit into my workflows in practice. Starting a video with my AirPods Pro is something I could definitely see myself doing, and even if I don&rsquo;t end up recording a podcast with them, I&rsquo;ll never complain about better voice quality.</p>
<p id="p8">These new features will be available for AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and AirPods Pro 2 this fall, with a public beta starting next month.</p>
