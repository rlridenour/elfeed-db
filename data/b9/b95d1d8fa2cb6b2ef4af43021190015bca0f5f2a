Apple Umeda has an Apple Pickup station for in-store pickup of online orders, plus a Genius Bar with varied table and seat heights for improved accessibility.<br/>
<br/>
Umeda is a busy mixed-use district of Osaka, with two major train stations, shops, restaurants, and more. Apple's store is in the Grand Front shopping mall.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shared more details about the Umeda store <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/24/apple-opening-new-store-in-osaka-japan/">in a press release</a> this week.<br/>

The new Apple Touchwood Centre is located directly across the hall from the original store in Touchwood Solihull, a shopping mall near Birmingham. Apple took over a unit previously occupied by Topshop, next to clothing retailer Superdry.<br/>
