Below, we recap iOS 27 rumors so far:<ul><li><strong>Siri Chatbot:</strong> iOS 27 will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/21/siri-chatbot-ios-27/">reportedly include a full-out Siri chatbot</a> that you can have back-and-forth conversations with. This would make Siri more like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Due to delays, iOS 27 might also include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/">at least some personalized Siri features</a> that were announced back in 2024.</li><br/>
<li><strong>New Apple Intelligence Features:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-future-apple-intelligence-features/">Apple and Google announced that Gemini will help power</a> some new Apple Intelligence features, which will likely begin rolling out on iOS 27. For example, it has been rumored that Apple Intelligence capabilities are <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1930993597828169916">coming to Apple's Calendar app</a>. There was also a rumor about an Apple Health+ subscription service</a> that would have included personalized, AI-powered health and fitness recommendations, but Apple has reportedly gone back to the drawing board on that, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/apple-reportedly-scales-back-ios-27-feature/">only bits and pieces of it</a> might arrive.</li><br/>
<li><strong>New Satellite Features:</strong> iOS 27 will reportedly support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/24/iphone-18-pro-full-5g-satellite-internet-rumor/">5G satellite internet connectivity</a>, although this functionality might be limited to the upcoming iPhone 18 Pro models with Apple's next-generation C2 modem. Additional satellite features have been rumored, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/09/apple-developing-new-satellite-features/">Apple Maps via satellite</a> and the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/09/apple-developing-new-satellite-features/">send and receive photos when using Messages via satellite</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Bug Fixes and Stability Focus:</strong> iOS 27 will reportedly be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/23/ios-27-two-key-upgrades/">similar to Mac OS X Snow Leopard</a>, in the sense that Apple is apparently focused on improving "quality and underlying performance." Apple is expected to focus on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/ios-27-to-focus-on-bug-fixes-and-tweaks/">bug fixes, improved stability, and Liquid Glass design enhancements</a>.</li></ul>iOS 27 beta testing is expected to begin during WWDC in June, and the update should be released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-27/">iOS 27</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/12/ios-27-features-rumors/">iOS 27 Will Add These New Features to Your iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-27-will-add-these-new-features-to-your-iphone.2477592/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
