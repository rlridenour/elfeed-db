<p>The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has sharply reduced how long many foreign nationals, including refugees and asylum seekers, can keep their employment authorisation documents, cutting the maximum validity for several categories from five years to 18 months under rules taking effect in December 2025 and July 2025 depending on status. The policy applies to both initial and renewal work permits for people such as recognised refugees, individuals granted asylum or withholding of deportation, and applicants with pending green card or other relief applications, while some groups like those on Temporary Protected Status (TPS), certain parolees and entrepreneur parole recipients will see their permits tied to shorter one‑year limits or to the end of their authorised stay, whichever comes first. USCIS Director Joseph Edlow and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the aim is to allow more frequent security vetting after legislation signed earlier this year and in light of a November shooting in Washington involving National Guard service members, while critics quoted in some reports describe the move as another step in President Trump’s broader immigration crackdown that also froze new immigration applications from citizens of 19 countries this week. Although the rules bring more uncertainty for migrants who rely on stable work authorisation, existing documents issued before the change remain valid for their full printed duration, giving current holders time to adapt or seek legal guidance.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/V9EZ68Rel14BXn7-zt5UHsPskvweKowLybytY3dZKlha0_LxW42m2ZgT-I2iEW40SLqLTnUynYPqH2xP3G0r8HgNp-XxYSzF0jlLOKNURv7R' alt='A woman departs a US Citizenship and Immigration Services office in New York, reflecting the agency’s central role in administering work permits.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who is affected: The shortened validity covers refugees, approved asylum recipients, people granted withholding of removal, and those with pending adjustment-of-status or similar relief applications, meaning a broad swath of migrants who are legally in the US now face more frequent renewals.</li><li>One-year categories: People paroled as refugees, migrants with Temporary Protected Status, and foreign entrepreneurs on parole fall under even tighter limits, with work cards capped at 12 months or the end of their authorised TPS or parole period, whichever comes first.</li><li>Application timing: The measure applies not only to new filings but also to cases already pending on or after specific implementation dates of December 5, 2025, or July 22, 2025, depending on the immigration category involved.</li><li>Security justification: USCIS argues that shorter validity periods allow &quot;more frequent vetting&quot; of foreign nationals, a rationale it links to safety concerns after an attack on National Guard service members in Washington in late November and to new legislation adopted this year.</li><li>Parallel travel restrictions: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the administration plans to expand its travel ban list to more than 30 countries, building on an existing freeze on immigration applications from citizens of 19 nations announced two days earlier.</li></ul><blockquote>The reduced maximum validity periods will result in more frequent vetting of aliens who apply for authorisation to work in the US - US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) statement</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>USCIS leadership: USCIS Director Joseph Edlow linked the change directly to safety concerns, saying reducing the maximum validity period for work authorisation would help ensure people seeking to work in the US do not threaten public safety or promote harmful ideologies.
