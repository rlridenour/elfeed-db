  <dd>PSA: I mentioned the Mullvad VPN in a recent Web Excursions post, and said that I&rsquo;d discovered the hard way that it didn&rsquo;t work with Tailscale. I heard from a <em>ton</em> of people that there was actually an official integration for that. For $5/mo you can add Mullvad as an exit point to Tailscale and use both at the same time.</dd>

  <dd>This is basically the way I used to copy SQL databases back when I used them more often. Dump a stable copy, compress and rsync, uncompress and import.</dd>

    <p>This is a pretty nifty little app that intelligently names things like screenshots and PDFs based on their contents. It can even accept templates telling it what information to look for in the contents and then filling in blanks with the results. And it can watch entire folders and rename files as they&rsquo;re added. I&rsquo;ve talked to the developer about add Shortcuts integration so it can be inlined into things like Hazel workflows, and he says he&rsquo;s working on it!</p>

<p>I do all of my screenshots and screen recordings with CleanShot X. I love it to pieces. <a href="https://cleanshot.sjv.io/DKRzyd">You should get it.</a></p>
