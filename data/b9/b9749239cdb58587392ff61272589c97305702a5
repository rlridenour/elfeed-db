The new store at Montgomery Village will be holding its grand opening on Friday, January 23, at 12 p.m. local time, according to Apple's website.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will have a much larger space at Montgomery Village compared to its existing location at the Santa Rosa Plaza, and it will of course have a modern design. Many newer stores feature a dedicated Apple Pickup station for online orders.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in California, Apple continues to renovate its store <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/carlsbad/">in Carlsbad</a>, north of San Diego. Apple has a temporary location there, at 1925 Calle Barcelona. Apple is also operating out of a temporary store at the South Coast Plaza shopping mall <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/southcoastplaza/">in Costa Mesa</a>, south of Los Angeles, while it renovates its original location there.<br/>
