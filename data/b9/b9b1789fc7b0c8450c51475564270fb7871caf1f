Here&rsquo;s yet another post commenting on something that Bozhidar Batsov wrote on Emacs Redux. I like to write about his posts because they typically look at some Emacs functionality that we all thought we knew about and tells us things about that functionality that we didn&rsquo;t know.
</p>
<p>
His latest <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2025/03/31/essential-flyspell/">post is about flyspell</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using flyspell for so long that I have no memory of when I started or how I discovered it. On the other hand, my sole use of it is to invoke <code>flyspell-auto-correct-previous-word</code> with its default binding of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd>. I was vaguely aware that you could do manual checks or even check a whole buffer but I never used them.
</p>
<p>
Batsov&rsquo;s post discusses some of those other commands. You can, for example, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> to move to the next misspelling. Then you can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> to correct it.
</p>
<p>
I like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> because the point doesn&rsquo;t have to be on the misspelling; it corrects the previous error wherever it is. Batsov, on the other hand, likes <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> <kbd>$</kbd> because it gives you a menu of possible corrections as well as options to accept it in the current buffer, accept it in the current session, or add it to your dictionary. The key binding is—for me—significantly more awkward so I&rsquo;m going to stick with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> unless I want to add the word to my dictionary.
</p>
<p>
But Batsov is a serious Emacs user and his recommendations shouldn&rsquo;t be ignored. Read his post and see what you think. As usual, Emacs has got you covered whatever your preferences.
