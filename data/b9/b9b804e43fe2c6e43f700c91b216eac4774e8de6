<p>Just a few years ago, the philosophy major <a href="https://dailynous.com/2022/08/24/the-philosophy-major-continues-to-recover-and-diversify-in-the-u-s-guest-post/">seemed on the rise</a>. Now, the data reveal a different picture.<span id="more-55330"></span></p>
<p>As Eric Schwitzgebel shares in the following guest post, the number of undergraduate degrees awarded in philosophy (and their share of the total undergraduate degrees awarded) has declined over the past few years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he notes that &#8220;relatively elite schools award disproportionately many philosophy degrees&#8212;and this tendency has increased as the percentage of students earning philosophy degrees has declined.&#8221;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Plummeting Philosophy Major in the US<br />
<em><strong>by Eric Schwitzgebel</strong></em></h2>
<p>Three years ago, I posted <a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2022/08/the-philosophy-major-continues-to.html" rel="">some optimistic reflections</a> about how the philosophy major seemed to be recovering from its recent decline in the U.S. I take it back. The National Center for Education Statistics has released its numbers from the 2023-2024 academic year, and it’s bad.</p>
<p>First off: The humanities in general have been hemorrhaging majors since about 2008. English in particular has been hammered. In the 2000-2001 academic year, 4.5% bachelor’s degrees recipients were English majors. Now it’s 1.7%. [1]

<p>Since philosophy started out low, its decline is not as visually evident in the above graph. Here are the raw numbers:</p>
<p>Year: Philosophy BAs awarded (as a % of all Bachelor’s degrees)</p>

Weinberg with ChatGPT]</p></div>As you can see, there were grounds for hope around 2019-2021. However, since 2021 the number of bachelor’s degree completions in philosophy has fallen from 8328 to 7091&#8212;<em><strong>a 15% decline in just three years</strong></em>. The percentage of college students receiving philosophy degrees is at an all-time low.</p>
<p>Bachelor’s degree completions in general have declined somewhat. They peaked at 2,068,932 in the 2020-2021 academic year and have declined slightly in every subsequent year, down to 1,959,325 for the 2023-2024 academic year&#8212;a 5% decline overall. Possible explanations of this general trend include: a hangover from the pandemic, demographic shifts, or a decline in the perceived value of a university education.</p>
<p>I was curious whether the decline in philosophy majors would be more pronounced at schools with fewer philosophy majors. In <a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2021/07/schools-with-most-philosophy-majors.html" rel="">a post from 2021</a>, I had found that from 2010-2019, just 20 schools accounted for 17% of philosophy degrees awarded in the U.S. Returning to those same data for the 2023-2024 academic year, I found that <em><strong>the top 20 schools now account for 22% of all philosophy degrees</strong></em> awarded.</p>
<p>Another way to examine the increasing concentration is to check Carnegie classifications. <a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/carnegie-classification/classification-methodology/2021-undergraduate-profile-classification/" rel="">Carnegie classifies undergraduate institutions</a> as “selective” if they are in the 40th-80th percentile of selectivity in undergraduate admissions based on test scores, and “more selective” if they in the 80th-100th percentile of selectivity. <em><strong>Fifty-two percent of philosophy degree recipients are from “more selective” schools, compared to 25% of bachelor’s degree recipients overall</strong></em>; and 84% of philosophy degree recipients are from either selective or more selective schools, compared to 62% overall. In 2010-2019, 45% of philosophy BAs were from more selective schools (vs. 23% overall) and 80% were from either selective or more selective schools (vs. 60% overall), confirming the increasing concentration.</p>
<p>Thus, relatively elite schools award disproportionately many philosophy degrees&#8212;and this tendency has increased as the percentage of students earning philosophy degrees has declined.</p>
<p>For those who are curious which universities awarded the most philosophy degrees in 2023-2024, according to the NCES IPEDS classifications, it is:</p>
<p>University of Pennsylvania: 193<br />
University of California-Los Angeles: 117<br />
University of California-Santa Barbara: 93<br />
University of California-Berkeley: 91<br />
University of Washington-Seattle Campus: 88<br />
University of Southern California: 84<br />
New York University: 76<br />
University of Maryland-College Park: 75<br />
University of Chicago: 71<br />
Boston College: 71<br />
University of Colorado Boulder: 69<br />
Boston University: 67<br />
Arizona State University Digital Immersion: 65<br />
University of Wisconsin-Madison: 57<br />
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University: 56<br />
University of California-Davis: 55<br />
Emory University: 55<br />
Columbia University in the City of New York: 53<br />
University of Michigan-Ann Arbor: 51<br />
University of California-Santa Cruz: 48<br />
University of Florida: 47<br />
Arizona State University Campus Immersion: 46<br />
University of Pittsburgh-Pittsburgh Campus: 46<br />
The University of Texas at Austin: 46</p>
<p>Note: Some of these numbers include interdisciplinary philosophy majors, such as Penn’s Philosophy, Politics &amp; Economics major.</p>
<p>All of these universities except the two Arizona State universities are Carnegie classified as “more selective”.</p>

<p>Note [1] &#8211; Method: The NCES IPEDS databases, custom data files, EZ group U.S. only, completions by CIP number, including both first and second majors, CIP categories 16 for foreign language and literature, 23 for English, 54 for History, and 38.01 for Philosophy. Each year captures the academic year ending that spring. For example 2024 is the 2023-2024 academic year.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/10/15/the-plummeting-philosophy-major-in-the-us-guest-post/">The Plummeting Philosophy Major in the US (guest post)</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
