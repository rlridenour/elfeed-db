<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the pitch: it&#8217;s a philosophy movie&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8220;Huh.&#8221;<br />
</em><span id="more-55308"></span>&#8220;based on a philosophy book&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8220;I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;</em><br />
&#8220;by an actual philosopher.&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</em><br />
&#8220;That is, a philosophy professor.&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say.&#8221;</em><br />
&#8220;An <em>analytic</em> philosophy professor.&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8220;Sold!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Okay, that&#8217;s not how it happened.</p>
<p>But somehow, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tetralogue-Im-Right-Youre-Wrong/dp/0198728883?_encoding=UTF8&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.LhQDBs7TrC1lT1G5Xw9tvtbXaUJaoXMQ4bLitJN6B4IxgRAGNAHF3ATv6cT1Yl-q_qvTKyJa4RBq8EUsuDO0yQ.lgI4iO8tjjDk0M6z27NVyi3UD3R3n3jXxjJ4Ads0UTI&amp;qid=1760456614&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dainou-20&amp;linkId=025b3ff62eecc876ed3c3d91fd4744ae&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tetralogue</a></em>, by <a href="https://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/people/timothy-williamson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timothy Williamson</a>, Senior Research Fellow and Emeritus Wykeham Professor of Logic at the University of Oxford, is getting made into a movie.</p>
<p>The book, published in 2015, isn&#8217;t a typical philosophical monograph. It recounts a fictional conversation among four strangers on a train, each with differing views, who discuss and argue about a variety of subjects.</p>
<p>It was one of several books included in a book club of actors and philosophers begun by director <a href="https://www.valdesiga.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jorge Valdés-Iga</a> during the Covid-19 pandemic. Valdés-Iga invited Professor Williamson to join their final session on his book. Williamson said he was impressed by the discussion, and Valdés-Iga, who must have been impressed by the book, came up with the idea of making a movie of it.</p>

<p>Williamson says that he and Valdés-Iga have been in occasional communication about the film. &#8220;We talk about the characters, how they speak and feel,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Much of the original dialogue will be preserved, though there will be a bit more action than in the book. Jorge needs space to develop it in a way that he feels will work on screen, which of course isn’t the same as what works on the page.&#8221;</p>
<p>The casting for the movie is being done right now (over 6000 actors applied). &#8220;I’m impressed at how many of them are able to bring the words to life,&#8221; Williamson says.</p>
<p>The movie, titled <em>Tetralogue</em>, will be filmed in November. The plan is to show it initially at film festivals in 2026.</p>
<p>Your suggestions for film adaptations of other philosophy books are welcome.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/10/14/philosophy-book-to-become-movie/">Philosophy Book to Become Movie</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
