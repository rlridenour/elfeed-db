<p>Yesterday, I <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/09/06/kagi-news-looks-really-good.html">posted</a> about the new Kagi news and shared it with Nat. Nat is very skeptical about AI in general, and reminded me of the main problem he has with AI technologies like this one: the authors get no credit. In this case, the writers of the news articles who are used in the summaries have no idea, and probably get nothing in terms of profit, when I read these articles.</p>
<p>Even if I only read a small portion of the article (the summaries are small, only a paragraph or so) and each summary is made of a mix of many articles, the problem remains. Makes me wonder if there&rsquo;s a better way to handle this&hellip;?</p>
