<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR on social media as a new Pentagon-led mission to remove “narco-terrorists” from the Western Hemisphere, saying it is led by a Joint Task Force and U.S. Southern Command. The announcement follows a U.S. naval and air buildup in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific and comes after U.S. forces have struck roughly 20 suspected drug-smuggling vessels since September, with reporting putting deaths in those strikes at about 76–80 people. Officials say the operation was ordered by President Trump and that senior military leaders have briefed the president on possible target options inside Venezuela, though no presidential decision on strikes there has been announced. Mexico has said it will deploy its navy to intercept suspected trafficking boats in international waters under an operational protocol agreed with the U.S., intended to reduce further maritime attacks.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/o1xoYCWja52K83XOeLGoZQSL7g1gEmylzGwFAy32PCibHipnGrjfGUOmyau9UUhEDbDq7dDfUh5d2T8g2wda6NPxEoCrnqvVlOTyYxSI4y_C' alt='US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth addresses senior military officers at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia, on September 30. — AFP/File' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Unmanned assets: Reporting says Operation Southern Spear will deploy an unprecedented mix of robotic air and sea vessels — including unmanned surface and aerial platforms — to surveil and target cartel smuggling routes.</li><li>Regional deployments: The U.S. has sent a carrier strike group, at least six Navy ships and F‑35 stealth aircraft to the wider Caribbean and eastern Pacific amid the operation announcement, prompting heightened regional military postures.</li><li>Command structure: Defense officials framed the mission as led by a Joint Task Force named Southern Spear under U.S. Southern Command, signaling consolidated operational control for Western Hemisphere maritime missions.</li><li>Mexico cooperation: Mexico and the U.S. agreed operational protocols that assign Mexico’s navy responsibility for intercepting suspected trafficking vessels in international waters to reduce further strikes, following a failed rescue attempt 400 nautical miles off Acapulco.</li></ul><blockquote>Today, I’m announcing Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR.
