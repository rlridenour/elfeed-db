<p>In the latest development in Iran’s unrest over the rising cost of living and the plunging rial, security forces clashed with demonstrators around Tehran’s Grand Bazaar, using tear gas and pushing people to disperse as parts of the market shut down. Rights groups and activists outside Iran say dozens have been killed during days of demonstrations, while Iranian officials have said some members of the security forces have also died. Iran’s government has said it is investigating violence linked to weekend protests, as rights groups accuse security forces of lethal force and incidents involving a hospital in Ilam province.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/umSVqukxUcDphtQKaLkmv25DXWEahXAoaE16BJELA6n62yC7cs2vRymVj-fsWyAlB-SI9gAagVYaz0Ee2JsFwojyRlm3OyJQ-X8wt82pRduzBXW5D9derA4Dl-69lXOVgkok_5bHX51orjyUro9jhB8FGtmSorA6Ajc-rJCQkU38cSxeF04sI8tveKesJ4OBKRaMBQiTRF8AO9gnu0or26Z-yafUanGpZYD3C5pbhByL5Z0Z9kIn-O-JcfxSs2Orp47_VMyTcayqLW7HJrRId_OdQGI_jKoC363L0FXwcLr0qawGrEG8az3fZbdZp4MOoR6z3ZY50jiREpe4Z3sS2QVqrMCV8kNPNoYR3sggiAmSZ7JGCnPiXTYiNQxNSdFGWIPPZ71oYd_q9uZ0SA' alt='Video still associated with reporting on Iran demonstrations and casualties' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Hospital exposure: Reports said tear gas drifted toward a hospital during dispersals in Tehran, and authorities said it was not intentionally fired at the medical facility.</li><li>Currency pressure: Iran’s rial hit another record low as protests continued, with separate reporting noting the Central Bank reduced subsidised dollar exchange rates offered to importers and producers, a move expected to worsen conditions.</li><li>Arrests reported: Iranian authorities have arrested hundreds amid the demonstrations, according to reporting that describes the dissent as spreading beyond economic grievances into anti-government slogans.</li><li>Competing claims: State media said some protesters were armed, a claim disputed in accounts from rights groups that accuse security forces of killing demonstrators.</li><li>US warning: President Donald Trump warned he would intervene if Iranian authorities kill protesters, though analysts cited in reporting said Washington is more likely to pursue limited strikes than attempt an invasion aimed at regime change.</li></ul><blockquote>Change… is ultimately in the hands of the people of Iran themselves, - Reza Pahlavi</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iranian government: Officials said they are investigating violence tied to weekend protests, while state media asserted that some protesters were armed.
