<blockquote>
  <p>Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE) is the culmination of an
unprecedented design and engineering effort, spanning half a
decade, that combines the unique strengths of Apple silicon
hardware with our advanced operating system security to provide
industry-first, always-on memory safety protection across our
devices — without compromising our best-in-class device
performance. We believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents
the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of
consumer operating systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, to say the least, an incredibly bold statement. But I think it’s true. This is a fascinating post, cogently written.</p>
