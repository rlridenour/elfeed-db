<p>Gunmen attacked two villages in Nigeria’s western Kwara state, killing at least 162 people in what several outlets described as one of the country’s deadliest assaults in recent months. Reports most often named Woro and Nuku, and said attackers set homes and shops on fire, deepening the damage for those who survived. Officials and aid groups confirmed different pieces of the picture. Police said an attack happened but did not release a casualty figure, while other reports cited a lawmaker’s toll and the Red Cross’s estimate. The Kwara state government blamed “terrorist cells,” and coverage linked the killings to Nigeria’s wider insecurity involving jihadist and other armed groups.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/nsCzYCGlyAoZxdArwb-NFaLGX3-wIIhq_LtHPPNRMacWb-IoZP2h3MpQnu3vJjTQnA0658jv5VprVVxQvKgcQbY88xgTSc_7tatqj_7-KXqBykJ3hfOnu8Lv8ydK0MusYUWnEo85tCeITOu9tYRm29w4kvZFM0s9O18DQjnAPX-PL5zqa7iW2XnxufaQxErkK0xZNCEKW0sve4hYSJzuKE_7lkJlgSVjUY4IuUpXZzJkCtqbZ7fkbPeKp7N1Ph_0bbM7vr3skead4mG_5c_i' alt='Aftermath image accompanying reports on attacks in Woro and Nuku, Kwara state.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>How it unfolded: A local lawmaker said the attackers rounded up residents, tied their hands behind their backs, and shot them—describing deliberate executions rather than crossfire.</li><li>Who reported it (and when): The death toll cited across outlets came from Mohammed Omar Bio, a member of parliament representing the area.
