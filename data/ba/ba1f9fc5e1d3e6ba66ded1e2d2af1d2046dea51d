My eldest sister got a Nintendo Switch. Now she can join my middle sister, the kids, and me in a Minecraft Realm. We're all in different timezones, so we needed to figure out a good time to meet. I briefly contemplated firing up <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html">timeanddate.com's Meeting Planner</a>, but I wanted an Emacs way to do things.

I remembered coming across <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/announcing-casual-timezone.html">casual-timezone-planner</a> in one of the Emacs News posts in June. It only handled one remote timezone, but it was easy to extend <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual/blob/main/lisp/casual-timezone-utils.el#:~:text=(hl%2Dline%2Dmode%20t))-,(defun%20casual%2Dtimezone%2Dplanner,-(remote%2Dtimezones%20datestamp)">casual-timezone-utils.el</a> to support multiple timezones. I changed <code>completing-read</code> to <code>completing-read-multiple</code>, added the columns to the vtable, and updated a few more functions. kickingvegas tweaked it a little more, and now multiple timezone support is in the version of <a href="https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual">casual</a> that's on MELPA. Yay!

We settled on 7 AM Los Angeles, 10 AM Toronto, 4 PM Amsterdam, and we played on Saturday and Sunday. Had lots of fun!
