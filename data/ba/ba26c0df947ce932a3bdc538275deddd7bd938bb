<blockquote>
  <p>Finder has four view modes, represented by the four consecutive
toolbar icons in the screenshot below, if you can even call that
free-floating monstrosity a toolbar anymore: Icons, List, Columns,
and Gallery. My preference is columns view, which I’ve been using
for as long as I remember, going back to Mac OS X.</p>

<p>At the bottom of each column is a resizing widget that you can use
to change the width of the columns. Or rather, you <em>could</em> use it to
change the width of the columns. On macOS Tahoe, the horizontal
scroller covers the resizing widget and prevents it from being
clicked!</p>

<p>I <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/12/macos-26-cut-corner">joked last week</a> that it would make more sense if we found out that the team behind redesigning the UI for MacOS 26 Tahoe was hired by Meta not <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/12/bad_dye_job">a month ago</a>, but an entire year ago, and secretly sabotaged their work to make the Mac look clownish and amateur. More and more I’m wondering if the joke’s on us and it actually happened that way. It’s like MacOS, once the crown jewel of computer human interface design, has been vandalized.</p>
