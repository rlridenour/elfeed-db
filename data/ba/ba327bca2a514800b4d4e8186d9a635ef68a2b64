<p>Yasser Abu Shabab, a Bedouin clan chief who led the Israeli-backed Popular Forces militia opposing Hamas in Gaza, was shot dead this week in Rafah while intervening in a family dispute, according to his group and local reports. Popular Forces representatives say he was killed by members of a rival clan during the mediation effort and have publicly rejected claims that Hamas was responsible. Israel had supported the creation of the Popular Forces as part of a strategy to empower local actors against Hamas’s control in Gaza, making his death a setback for that approach and raising questions about the risks of arming tribal-based militias in a fragile security environment. The killing underscores the complex mix of family, clan and political rivalries in Gaza, where attempts to build alternative power structures have to navigate deep local tensions as well as the broader conflict.</p><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Popular Forces role: The Popular Forces, made up largely of members of the Abu Shabab Bedouin clan and other allies, had been promoted by Israel as a partner to challenge Hamas’s authority and help secure areas where Israeli ground forces withdrew.</li><li>Circumstances disputed: While some early reports suggested Hamas involvement, the Popular Forces issued statements calling those reports &quot;misleading&quot; and insisting the shooting stemmed from a personal and family-related dispute rather than a political assassination.</li><li>Israeli policy setback: Israeli officials had portrayed cooperation with groups like the Popular Forces as an experiment in indirect governance in Gaza, and Abu Shabab’s death now raises concerns in Israel about the reliability, cohesion and personal security of such local partners.</li><li>Internal Gaza tensions: Local reporting describes the incident as part of longstanding clan rivalries in Rafah, illustrating how armed family networks in Gaza can quickly become entangled with broader political and military struggles.</li><li>Messaging after killing: After the shooting, Popular Forces spokespeople emphasized that their group would continue operating and framed Abu Shabab’s death as a sacrifice while seeking to avoid an immediate escalation with Hamas by denying its involvement.</li></ul><blockquote>His blood will not be spilled in vain - Spokesperson for the Popular Forces</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Popular Forces militia: The Popular Forces said Abu Shabab was killed while trying to mediate a dispute between families in Rafah and stressed that reports blaming Hamas for the shooting were &quot;misleading&quot; and inaccurate.
