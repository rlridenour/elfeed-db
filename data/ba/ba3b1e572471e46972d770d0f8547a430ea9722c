Apple introduced a new version of the Vision Pro with M5 chip this week, and it came with <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/DUAL_KNIT_BAND_SA/apple-vision-pro-dual-knit-band">a Dual Knit Band</a> that Apple says is more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. M5 Vision Pro buyers will get the new band automatically, but those who have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Vision Pro also have the option to buy it separately.<br/>

It appears &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Vision Pro owners are eager for an accessory that makes the headset easier to wear, because the &#36;99 Dual Knit Band is now backordered for at least a month. As of yesterday, new Dual Knit Band orders were delivering between November 7 and November 14, and wait times could get even longer.<br/>
<br/>
There are some retail stores that may have the Dual Knit Band in stock starting next week, as the M5 Vision Pro will launch on Wednesday, October 22.<br/>
<br/>
The Dual Knit Band is made from the same 3D knitted material as the Solo Knit Band, but it has a two-strap design. One strap fits at the back of the head as before, but a second strap goes over the top of the head for better weight distribution.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also added tungsten inserts to the ribbed back loop for counterbalance and a fit that is supposed to improve balance and stability. Apple says that the Dual Knit Band is soft and breathable, with a Fit Dial to adjust each strap independently.<br/>

The Dual Knit Band is available in small, medium, and large sizes, and making a purchase requires using an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> camera to find the right fit for your face size.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/17/apple-vision-pro-dual-knit-band-popular/">Apple&#039;s New Vision Pro Dual Knit Band Proves Popular</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-vision-pro-dual-knit-band-proves-popular.2469314/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
