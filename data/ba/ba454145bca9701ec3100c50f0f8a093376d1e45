<p>&#8220;We, the undersigned members of the APA and the wider philosophical community, write to express our dismay and deep disappointment regarding the APA&#8217;s conspicuous silence concerning the genocide unfolding in Palestine.&#8221;<span id="more-54470"></span></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Unequivocally condemn the ongoing atrocities and war crimes against Palestinians that are financially and politically supported by our governments in the US and Canada.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><em>Express solidarity with Palestinian scholars, intellectuals, and students who are enduring immense suffering under war crimes, siege, and mass starvation.</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><em>Honor the APA’s commitment to the mission of SAR and create a fellowship program to support displaced scholars and students from Palestine.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The petition, started by two philosophy professors, Sara Aronowitz and Reza Hadisi, currently has over 200 signatures.</p>
<p>The petition notes the contrast between the APA&#8217;s speed in <a href="https://www.apaonline.org/news/597783/APA-board-endorses-SAR-statement-in-solidarity-with-the-people-of-Ukraine.htm?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">condemning the Russian attack on Ukraine</a> with its lack of official statement on the horrors Israel has visited upon the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Anticipating one kind of objection to such a statement, the petition&#8217;s text includes the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The APA&#8217;s stance is of course insignificant for global events, but your continued inaction in addressing this crisis sends a chilling message. It suggests that war crimes perpetrated against Brown, Arab, or Muslim people and scholars are of less concern to this organization. This stark disparity in expressing support makes the APA an unwelcoming place for a significant number of students and scholars. Further, the suppression of speech on Palestine at universities in America and around the world lends to the impact of silence by academic organizations like the APA. </em></p>
<p>The APA&#8217;s policy regarding Board Letters is <a href="https://www.apaonline.org/page/boardletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. (My understanding is that the Board has been approached at least once before about issuing such a statement, though I am not sure of the details regarding its proposed content or the deliberations over it.)</p>
<p>You can sign the petition <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFIA1tvqtPcYICrHEy8TvsxdObYeX2qahlSlGSaGT2hHWCnQ/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE </strong>(7/31/25): I am informed by Amy Ferrer, Executive Director of the APA, that the APA board plans to discuss the petition at its next meeting in August.</p>
