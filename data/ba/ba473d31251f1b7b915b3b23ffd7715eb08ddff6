</ul><h1>Fact Finding</h1><p>Look back on our March sale of these Tommy John boxer briefs, and you’ll notice this:</p>

<p>Now, those are some pretty impressive numbers. Which, to be transparent, led to some pretty unimpressive shipping delays and a few cancellations. Still, the point stands: people really seem to like these Tommy John boxer briefs.</p>
<p>But who likes them the most?</p>
<p>To figure that out, we scrolled down to the map and started clicking around.</p>
<p>Lo and behold, South Dakota yielded perhaps the darkest-shaded county of anywhere in the country.</p>
<p><img height="466" src="https://d2b8wt72ktn9a2.cloudfront.net/mediocre/image/upload/v1753128319/khskjuzp7s7krcauvz2x.png" width="630" /></p>
<p>Further research (by which we mean, Googling “South Dakota counties”) led us to discover that this was Lyman County.</p>
<p>Immediately, we went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_County,_South_Dakota">the county’s Wikipedia page</a>, looking for some information that might help us better understand what made its population so ravenous for boxer briefs. The Wikipedia page turned up very little useful information. In fact, based on the scant information provided, one might even believe there is little going on there.</p>
<p>One thing we did see? This tidbit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The county was named for W. P. Lyman, a politician.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, naturally, we searched “W.P. Lyman,” hoping to find something telling about this person for whom America’s underwear-buying capital is named.</p>
<p>Again, very little information surfaced. We did, however, find this New York Times article from June 3, 1912, headlined “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1912/06/03/archives/injured-by-lunch-basket-mrs-wp-lyman-hurt-while-on-motor-trip.html">INJURED BY LUNCH BASKET.; Mrs. W.P. Lyman Hurt While on Motor Trip Through Berkshires.</a>” In it, the harrowing events this (likely completely different) W.P. Lyman faced were described thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mrs. William Pratt Lyman of Boston was hurt late yesterday afternoon while descend- ing the west side of Hoosac Mountain, following an automobile run along the Deerfield River. In the party were Mr. and Mrs. Lyman, Miss Martha C. Beeck- man of New York, Mrs. Lyman’s sister, and Amos Tuck French of Tuxedo… A lunch basket which had been strapped to the coat railing of the tonneau worked loose, and on a rise on the road flew back and struck Mrs. Lyman heavily on one leg. The basket cut through the flesh nearly to the bone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The logistics are a bit confusing, if we’re honest. But still? Don’t you see? Mrs. Lyman hurt her leg on a lunch basket, and now the people of Lyman County protect their upper legs with Tommy John boxer briefs to a greater degree than any other county in the country.</p>
<p>The connections are there, people. You just need to OPEN YOUR EYES!</p>
<p>And buy some boxer briefs, please.</p>
