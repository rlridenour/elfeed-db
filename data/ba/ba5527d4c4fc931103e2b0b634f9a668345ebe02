<p>In the latest development in northern Syria, government forces resumed operations in Aleppo’s Sheikh Maqsoud area after a temporary ceasefire broke down, with Damascus urging Kurdish-led fighters to surrender or withdraw. The Syrian army said it completed a security sweep and cleared what it described as the last Kurdish-held pocket in the city, while Kurdish forces denied losing the neighborhood and reported continued street fighting and shelling. The flare-up underscores the still-fragile process of integrating Kurdish forces and their local administration into Syria’s post-Assad political order, a key test for the authorities who took power about a year ago and say they want unified national control.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/1DEwOxwrGscIRhQlgcqJAERahpaUHaldpQoR8pl6cDeKMvda7c_d9GV1Lo-fs7_xMO7k_WuxrsdJAWbQSwpdBIgaJ4UTX9RRnQQ-zt2KMljFL5P-XgPzKTXR5HHLTUyxMQe5hjDdGJbB5UCpjzmPTG_KYRcrmjVJggrb2LNBVIEh2RZevy5wNup0ryRlWuidmPCe_p8zX0DLw9LWbBZTU8fjTNieHP_Caf70aaK27gilvDCFZO3wQ3vqzg' alt='Residents flee the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria, on January 9, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ceasefire terms: Kurdish groups in Aleppo said they would defend their neighborhoods and rejected ceasefire terms that required Kurdish fighters to withdraw, as the United States pressed for an end to the fighting.</li><li>Overnight escalation: Government forces began striking Sheikh Maqsoud overnight after a withdrawal deadline passed, and AFP reporters in the city said gunfire continued into Saturday morning.</li><li>Civilian displacement: Tens of thousands of residents fled parts of Aleppo as the clashes intensified, according to reporting that cited local on-the-ground observations and figures from the parties involved.</li><li>Turkey’s stance: Turkey publicly backed the Syrian army’s offensive against the Kurdish-led SDF in Aleppo despite the U.S.-backed ceasefire framework, highlighting competing external priorities around Kurdish armed groups.</li><li>Orders to residents: After announcing the sweep, the Syrian army urged residents to stay in their homes, citing continued Kurdish presence and ongoing security concerns.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Syrian army and defense ministry: The military says it completed a full security sweep of Sheikh Maqsoud and has called on remaining armed elements to surrender their weapons, portraying the operation as restoring state control.
