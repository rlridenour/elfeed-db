Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/02/foldable-iphone-development-progressing/">well into development</a> on the foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but it has decided to pause work on a larger-screened foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, reports <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250702pd210.html">Digitimes</a></em>.<br/>

There have been multiple rumors about Apple's work on some kind of notebook-sized foldable device. Some have referred to it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">as a foldable iPad</a>, while others have called it an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/">all-display MacBook</a>. Either way, it appears that development has stopped for the time being while Apple focuses on a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Digitimes</em> says that Apple is holding off on the foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; because of manufacturing difficulties, increased production expenses for foldable display technology, and modest consumer demand for larger foldable devices.<br/>
<br/>
If <em>Digitimes</em> is correct and Apple has decided not to work on a larger foldable for the time being, it doesn't mean it's a permanent decision. Apple could revisit a foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; or MacBook when display technology improves enough to become more affordable.<br/>
<br/>
The foldable device was rumored to be between 18.8 inches and 20.2 inches, with OLED display technology and a crease-free design. Information about a potential launch timeline has varied <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/apple-larger-foldable-mass-production-2026/">from 2026</a> to 2028, but it sounds like we could be waiting even longer.<br/>
<br/>
As for the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, it's expected to launch alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro models next year.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/02/apple-pauses-foldable-ipad-development/">Apple Pauses Work on Foldable iPad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pauses-work-on-foldable-ipad.2460069/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
