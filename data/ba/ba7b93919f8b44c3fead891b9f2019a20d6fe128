<p>Typhoon Fung-wong struck the northern Philippines this week, bringing floods and landslides that knocked out power to provinces and left officials reporting widespread displacement as damage assessments continue. Reported fatalities vary across outlets — some report at least eight to ten confirmed deaths while others place the figure higher as rescue teams work in affected areas. The storm arrived days after a previous typhoon that killed more than 200 people, compounding strain on response efforts. Meanwhile, Taiwan moved preemptively to evacuate thousands, close schools and offices and prepare for a possible landfall as Fung-wong tracked northward.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/YUc6ERvMFWRPWwB1YPWx5x-zWZijfXX3v7c8znGVWnpa5_RRchQDnNUScr91fKYJnrBbn4wSwsSPWRuBH4oNXHwJOp0P0Sxq0c5YKdP5PRH1ahbsXxTBn8aBtGcyCyhjt81IaciYg334HzSuAKxBmWMMW2z4s_KSc5aEY9nBwed5kOYt0PulJTEJLz7dAR1eGZw8v1qvOfN4B9EZJba7od8SHiMj0bwl2pU' alt='Workers clear debris from a highway in Dipaculao, Philippines, after Typhoon Fung-wong hit.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Mass evacuations: Around a million people were urged or ordered to leave their homes in the Philippines ahead of Fung-wong, with large-scale pre-storm evacuations documented in multiple towns.</li><li>Local cleanup: Workers were pictured clearing debris from highways in Dipaculao as crews began restoring access and assessing road damage after the storm passed.</li><li>Storm count: Fung-wong was recorded as the 21st typhoon to affect the Philippines this year, adding to an already busy and damaging season.</li><li>Response pressure: Humanitarian and emergency services faced stretched capacity because Fung-wong arrived just days after another storm that caused hundreds of deaths, complicating rescue and relief operations.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Philippine disaster authorities: Officials described search-and-rescue and evacuation operations underway amid floods and landslides as teams assessed casualties and displacement.
