<p>Longtime Macworld and New York Times columnist and prolific author David Pogue has a new project: a <a href="https://www.applefirst50.com/">600-page book about Apple’s history</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In time for Apple’s 50th anniversary, “CBS Sunday Morning” correspondent David Pogue tells the iconic company’s entire life story: how it was born, nearly died, was born again under Steve Jobs, and became, under CEO Tim Cook, one of the most valuable companies in the world. </p>
<p>  The 600-page book features 360 full-color photos, new facts that correct the record and illuminate Apple’s subversive culture, and 150 fresh interviews with the legendary figures who shaped Apple into what it is today.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m one of David’s many former editors and upon reflection, he seems like just about the best person around to write a book like this. I look forward to reading it when it’s published next March.</p>
