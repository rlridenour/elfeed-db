<p>This week I wrote about <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/08/20/merlin-mann-wisdom-project" title="wikilink">Merlin Mann’s Wisdom Project</a> where the Father of <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/08/23/43-folders-analog-productivity-hack" title="wikilink">43-Folders</a> shares life lessons he has learned — often through painful experience.</p>
<p>One of them is an intriguing tip for uncertain calendar events:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Your calendar represents a portfolio of promises to your future self. Treat it that way.
<ul>
<li>Thus: The only events allowed on a serious person’s calendar are commitments about time, location, and effort that will die if they are not successfully completed on a specific day. Full stop.</li>
<li>Corollary: If you’re only tentatively committed to a calendar item—especially if the time of the event has not been mutually confirmed—title the event using Spanish-language questions marks. A future event like<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><code>¿Pick apples with Aunt Sue?</code><span class="push-double"></span><span class="pull-double">”</span> successfully blocks out the time while also affording a quickly scannable reminder about events that still need to either be formalized or deleted.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I love the idea of the Spanish question marks surrounding tentative calendar entries, but putting it into practice proved difficult!</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-when-double-question-marks-dont-work">¿What to do when double question marks don’t work?</h3>
<p>For some reason I have yet to discover, pressing the <code>Option + Shift + ?</code> key combination doesn’t work on my Mac. It’s supposed to, but it doesn’t. Yes, I’ve tried installing the <span class="small-caps">ABC</span> keyboard; that doesn’t work either.</p>
<p>Now I could add a Spanish keyboard and switch to that to type the <code>¿</code>. What I really want, though, is a quick keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/c343a0dc-e2c6-4312-89eb-1095eaf62408.png" alt="Screenshot of Keyboard Maestro text expanding macro using the string /qq to insert text (¿) by typing." width="936" height="882"></p>
<p>So I’ve come up with <code>/qq</code>, in honour of the Mann himself. I made it into a text expander snippet in Keyboard Maestro, but you could also do it in <a href="https://espanso.org" target="_blank">Espanso</a>, or with the built-in Mac and iOS <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph6d01d862/ios" target="_blank">Text Replacement</a> feature. <span class="small-caps">FYI</span> you really don’t need anything fancy on iOS devices, as long-pressing the <code>?</code> always brings up <code>¿</code>.</p>
<p>And today I used it for the first time. Someone called to make an appointment they said they’d confirm later this week: the perfect opportunity to add it to my calendar the way Merlin recommends. It’s good to be able to see the <em>maybe</em> status of this task as I peruse the week to come!</p>
<h3 id="breaking-news-apple-broke-this-hack"><span class="small-caps">BREAKING</span> <span class="small-caps">NEWS</span>: Apple broke this hack</h3>
<p>Apple, in their finite wisdom, have decided they will micro-manage our lives by deleting white space and punctuation marks from the beginning of Calendar events. Other calendars, like Fantastical, seem to leave them alone.</p>
<p>Rather than try to force  Calendar to work (I’m sure there are ways), I’ve changed over to <code>--Appointment?</code> instead. It still communicates the uncertain nature of the entry, and stands out nicely from firmer<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>do-or-die” events.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering, that is very deliberately a double <code>--</code> rather than the elegant (but sadly overused, these days) <code>—</code> em dash. The stuttering nature of two consecutive dashes provides enough visual disruption to draw my eye to the event, reminding me that a follow-up conversation with the involved parties needs to take place.</p>
