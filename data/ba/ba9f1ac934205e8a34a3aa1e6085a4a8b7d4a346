<p>In the latest twist in the U.K.’s wider Jeffrey Epstein fallout, London’s Metropolitan Police has opened a criminal investigation into House of Lords peer Peter Mandelson. Police are looking at allegations of misconduct in public office linked to claims he shared sensitive government information with Epstein. Mandelson has also stepped down from the House of Lords amid allegations that he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein. Politically, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government has agreed to release emails and documents related to Mandelson’s appointment as U.K. ambassador to the United States. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the aim is “maximum transparency,” while acknowledging some material will be withheld if it could affect national security or international relations. The opposition Conservatives are pressing for the papers to be published, adding to pressure over how the government has handled the issue.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/aeT5Pq0GotpE3EAcy-J_KBJfHQ93iEXen3ePsdIrl01VzqrjotjkXbrY30vaKY3Fh3s0HyVb9jUsuasUu93iB3dYRUidC31zQRDHkh6yMye0IFyAXRGG7i5dTdTkJ30FtPv9GZXeXxn6jOD9aa99tGpTycSC_2eK9BnJfz0SW69xYsphfXVOvWyt58UlqBq5ZoVIkOsQlEoK2A' alt='Peter Mandelson last year.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>What police are examining: The Met is looking into claims that Mandelson leaked sensitive government information to Epstein, and whether the allegations meet the bar for “misconduct in public office”.</li><li>What the government says it will publish: Ministers say the release will cover how Mandelson was appointed, including correspondence with ministers and records linked to his later removal from the Washington role last September.</li><li>Why the disclosure is happening now: Starmer’s decision comes as Conservatives prepared a Commons move to force publication via a “humble address,” increasing pressure over what Mandelson disclosed about his Epstein links before his appointment.</li><li>What may be withheld: Streeting said the government will not publish anything it believes could compromise national security or the security services, or damage international relations.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>UK government (Wes Streeting): Streeting said Starmer wants “maximum transparency” around the papers on Mandelson’s appointment, but won’t release material that could compromise national security, the security services, or international relations.
