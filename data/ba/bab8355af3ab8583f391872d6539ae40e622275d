Even though we're at the fourth beta of iOS 26.1, Apple is continuing to add new features. In fact, the fourth beta has some of the biggest changes that we'll get when iOS 26.1 releases to the public later this month. We've rounded up what's new below.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Liquid Glass Transparency Toggle</h2><br/>
Apple added a toggle for customizing the look of Liquid Glass. In Settings &gt; Display and Brightness, there's a new option to switch between Clear or Tinted settings.<br/>
<br/>

Clear is more transparent and is the standard version of Liquid Glass that displays the background underneath buttons, menu bars, and other interface elements, while Tinted increases the opacity of Liquid Glass and adds contrast.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Lock Screen Camera Swipe</h2><br/>
In the Camera section of the Settings app, there's a Lock Screen Swipe to Open Camera setting, and turning it off disables the feature where you can swipe left to open the camera from the Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>

The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> has long allowed users to open the Camera app directly from the Lock Screen with a swipe, but it can be a setting that's easy to activate, and it provides a way for someone that gets ahold of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to use it to take unwanted photos.<br/>
<br/>
There was previously no way to turn off Lock Screen camera activation without disabling the camera app entirely.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Phone Haptics</h2><br/>
In the Phone app, there's a toggle to turn off haptic feedback when a call is connected or dropped.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Settings</h2><br/>
Apple has changed the look of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> section in the Settings app, and it is now left aligned. Apple made the alignment change for other sections of the Settings app in earlier betas, but &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; remained the same.<br/>
<br/>

Apple has also removed the "Beta" label from &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, but it's not clear if some features are officially out of beta, or if it's an oversight. Apple has not removed the beta labeling in macOS Tahoe 26.1 beta 4.<br/>
