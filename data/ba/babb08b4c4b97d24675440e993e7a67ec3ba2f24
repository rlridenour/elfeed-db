Apple takes its online store down for a few hours ahead of Black Friday every year to tease/prepare for its annual <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/20/apple-announces-2025-black-friday-event/">gift card offer</a> with the purchase of select products. The store already went down and came back online in Australia and New Zealand, and the gift card offer is <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/shop/gifts/shopping-event">now</a> <a href="https://www.apple.com/nz/shop/gifts/shopping-event">live</a> in those countries as expected.<br/>
<br/>
The store is down in the United Kingdom and many other European countries right now, and it will soon go down in the United States and Canada.<br/>

In case you missed the earlier announcement, Apple is offering a free gift card with the purchase of an eligible product in select countries, from November 28 through December 1.

Black Friday is one of the few occasions per year when Apple directly offers deals on its products, but better deals are often available through resellers like Amazon, so <strong>make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/27/best-30-black-friday-apple-deals/">Black Friday deals coverage</a></strong> for the latest discounts on iPads, Macs, AirPods, Apple Watches, accessories, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/black-friday/">Apple Black Friday</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/community-discussion.20">Community Discussion</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/27/heres-why-apple-store-is-down/">Here&#039;s Why the Apple Store is Going Down</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-why-the-apple-store-is-going-down.2472115/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
