<p>Hello, dear tech-curious, non-Emacs-literate Mac users!</p>
<p>Your Beorg-created file can be edited in many apps, but adding tags in some text editors may lead to unexpected results. If you are editing your Beorg file in <span class="small-caps">VS</span> Code on a Mac, be aware that tags added there might not work as expected. (Something about the colons, I think?)</p>
<p>I solved this by copying a Beorg-created task with a tag that <em>does</em> work, and making a text snippet out of it in Keyboard Maestro. You could just as easily use Text Expander or the built-in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh35735/mac" target="_blank">Text Replacement</a> on your Mac.</p>
<h3 id="tool-related-tip-2-use-easyorg-for-non-emacs-agenda-access">Tool-related tip 2: Use EasyOrg for non-Emacs Agenda access</h3>
<p>Use an app like Code for bulk changing tags and the like, but do most edits in <a href="https://easyorgmode.com/" target="_blank">EasyOrg</a> for non-Emacs access to your Beorg agenda. EasyOrg is free with limitations, or you can make a one-time purchase for access to all current and future features.</p>

<p>According to Berker Ceylan, time plus information = the 2-tool foundation for a productive, well-ordered life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Everything is either an event on a timeline or a piece of information you need to store.</strong>&nbsp;Forget the fancy features for a moment. Forget the <span class="small-caps">AI</span> integrations for a second.&nbsp;You can use them if you want but if you can master the flow of data between these two fundamental pillars, you can manage anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s an interesting premise; the two can certainly be managed in one tool. While I don’t disagree I do like maintaining a distinction between notes and tasks, by placing them into two distinct tools.</p>

<h3 id="process-related-tip-2-remove-the-verb-from-wait-tasks">Process-related tip 2: Remove the verb from <span class="small-caps">WAIT</span> tasks</h3>
<p>Tasks can have various states. Mine are</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="small-caps">TODO</span> <em>(Incomplete task)</em></li>
<li><span class="small-caps">DOING</span> <em>(Incomplete task that has been started)</em></li>
<li><span class="small-caps">WAIT</span> <em>(Task that can’t be completed without external input)</em></li>
<li><span class="small-caps">DONE</span> <em>(The task as written has been completed)</em></li>
<li><span class="small-caps">NOPE</span> <em>(I’m choosing not to do this)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the tip: always start incomplete tasks that require no external input (<span class="small-caps">TODO</span> and <span class="small-caps">DOING</span>) with a verb. Remove the verb when the state of the task shifts to <span class="small-caps">WAIT</span>. E.g. <span class="small-caps">TODO</span> Submit dental bill refund -&gt; <span class="small-caps">WAIT</span> Dental bill refund</p>
