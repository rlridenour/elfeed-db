<blockquote>
  <p>Cook is not stupid. He is not evil. He is trapped. The iron clasp
of market expectations has turned him into what he never meant to
be: a man who goes to parties at the White House while nurses die.</p>

<p>In <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>, Roy Bland captures a cynical,
post-ideological, corrupt English society: “You scratch my
conscience; I’ll drive your Jag.” You could say the same of
today’s Silicon Valley. It used to believe it could change the
world. Now it just hopes the world won’t change its stock price.</p>

  <p>If I ever meet Tim Cook I’m going to ask him if Mike Tyson enjoyed
the movie.</p>
