 
          <p>This post is the board game counterpart of the previous <a href="/post/2025/12/2025-in-video-games">2025 In Video Games</a> end of year note. There hasn&rsquo;t been a <em>Board Game Shelf Analysis</em> post in 2025 for some reason so I can&rsquo;t point you to recent photos of my collection. Because of two very young kids our board game time has been reduced to almost nothing, but nonetheless, I/we&rsquo;ve managed to squeeze in about 150 plays. That&rsquo;s even better than last year!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a collage of all board games I played in 2025 along with the amount of plays on the bottom right of each cover, ranked from most played to least:</p>

<p>A few side notes. For some weird reason, the play count is not accurate. For example, BGG records I&rsquo;ve played Regicide four times, which is correct. Still, the BG Stats app refuses to print out a nice yearly overview with accurate numbers. Also, note that most games that are heavily played (on the top) are <em>short games</em>. That&rsquo;s for a very good reason! Mage Knight, a notoriously long-winded one, was played exactly once to see how stuff works. I guess that means there&rsquo;s a lot of room for more joyful gaming and I don&rsquo;t need to spend more money to reap those benefits!</p>
<p>Since getting together becomes more difficult with a crying toddler and baby, squeezing in quick solo (card) games became the norm: Kingdom Legacy (10 plays), Reforest (9), Conservas (8) are all examples of those that can be played on the coach. Yet I&rsquo;m still proud that we played some more heavy hitters like SETI (5) and&hellip; wait&hellip; Great Western Trail (2)? Ok fine, SETI is the only bigger game that appeared once in a while.</p>
<p><a href="/post/2024/12/2024-in-board-games">Compared to 2024</a>, the &ldquo;one-off&rdquo; plays weren&rsquo;t that dramatic. It still fills one third of the above image but we replayed more games than we did test new ones and that&rsquo;s a good thing. the H-index for 2025 was 5, which I could have gamed by playing one more round of French Quarter. Here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://www.timjeanes.com/bggstats/">BGG Plays tool</a> graph:</p>

<p>The tail end isn&rsquo;t as long as in 2024 and I managed to colour in almost all die in the 10x10 challenge rectangle! If you watch closely you&rsquo;ll see that most of these die are one-sided meaning a solo play session. Games like Conservas and Kingdom Legacy are very quick and quite casual which plays (ha!) in their favour of returning to the table (or couch) the next evening.</p>
<p>There haven&rsquo;t been any big campaign games like last year&rsquo;s Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion&mdash;thank god for that. Dorfromantik Sakura that I picked up <a href="/post/2025/10/spiel-essen-2025">in SPIEL Essen this year</a> is strictly speaking campaign-based but very light to the touch and we enjoy it quite a lot. We&rsquo;re very close to unlocking box 3 and it&rsquo;s possible to start multiple campaigns for other friend groups.</p>
<p>As was the case last year, 6/159 or 3.7% of the plays were three-player or higher sessions. That&rsquo;s marginally better than last year&rsquo;s 2%. I&rsquo;ve come to accept that buying games that are only great with three or more will never end up in our shelf as they&rsquo;ll barely see the daylight. Hopefully a friend reading this will buy Cosmic Encounter and invite me over.</p>
<p>So which of these plays were <em>new</em> plays&mdash;or to put it differently: which of the games are my &ldquo;new&rdquo; 2025 GOTY games? I&rsquo;ll once again split this between games I played but don&rsquo;t own:</p>
<ul>
<li>💖 <strong>SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</strong>&mdash;clearly <em>the</em> Euro game of the year, what a banger. A must play.</li>
<li>💖 <strong>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Trick Taking Game</strong>&mdash;what can I say, I love <a href="/post/2025/09/the-flemish-trick-taking-tradition">trick taking games</a>.</li>
<li>💖 <strong>The Castles of Burgundy: Special Edition</strong>&mdash;a classic in a gigantic box that plays itself. It was the first time this year I played a proper <em>Burgundy</em> game.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the games we enjoyed the most and also own:</p>
<ul>
<li>💖 <strong>Dorfromantik Sakura</strong>&mdash;We have yet to discover most of what the game has to offer and already like it a lot.</li>
<li>💖 <strong>Reforest</strong>&mdash;Last year I nominated <em>Forest Shuffle</em> but perhaps I even like this nature-themed card placement game more.</li>
</ul>
<p>The jury is still out on Mage Knight (will probably love this), Great Western Trail, Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition and all the other low play ones. We like Sky Team a lot but if you play it too often or play multiple sessions in rapid succession it can become boring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very clear for me: SETI is my GOTY. It feels weird not to own it but it would be silly to buy it as one of my regular co-players owns it.</p>
<p>Games I didn&rsquo;t care for and will probably be looking to sell: Click A Tree (first play was disappointing), Cascadia: Rolling Hills (a mediocre roll-and-write), Let&rsquo;s Go! To Japan (not mine but it didn&rsquo;t click for me even though the art is great), Ora et Labora (an old friend that became a big long slog), and Conservas (it&rsquo;s very good but once you finish the campaign and know how it works it&rsquo;s dull).</p>
<p>It seems that we did buy quite a few <a href="/post/2025/02/roll-and-writes-board-games-lite">roll and write games</a>: Dinosaur Island is very cool, Rajas of the Ganges is good but not great, and I had high hopes for French Quarter as the designer is the one who invented previous year&rsquo;s GOTY Three Sisters. For me, I don&rsquo;t think any other roll and write will ever beat that game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to receiving the wonderfully weird Dark Venture skirmish game, unwrapping Spirit Island and Earthborne Rangers, and buying The Fate of the Fellowship!</p>
