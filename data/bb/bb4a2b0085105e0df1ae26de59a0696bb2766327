<p>Here’s an update I just appended to my post yesterday, after linking to <a href="https://shapeof.com/archives/2025/3/how_apple_could_help_developers_with_ai_and_llms.html">Gus Mueller’s suggestion</a> that Apple open up a semantic index to third-party AI apps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HealthKit already works a lot like what Mueller is suggesting here
(for, say, “SemanticKit”). With explicit user permission — that
can be revoked at any time — third party apps can both read from
and write to your Health data. Apple does a lot of that itself,
both through Apple Watch and from the various activity-related
things an iPhone can track, but third-party apps and devices are
welcome participants, in a private, easily-understood way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody is suggesting Apple should give up on AI. Quite the opposite. They really need to go from being <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/hey-siri-what-month-is-it">a joke</a> to being good at it, fast. But there’s no reason at all they should build out a strategy that relies on Apple doing all of it themselves, and Apple users relying solely on Apple’s own AI. Do it like Health — a model that has proven to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>profitable (for Apple itself, selling devices like Watches);</li>
<li>popular (with users, who actually use it, understand it, and like it);</li>
<li>private;</li>
<li>and open to third-party developers, device makers, and medical service providers.</li>
</ul>
