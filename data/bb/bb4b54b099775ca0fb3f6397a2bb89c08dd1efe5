<p>Wanted to send a pdf to my kindle for some holiday reading. You can easily do this by emailing the pdf to your kindle-bound email address.</p>
<p>Now, I typically attach files when composing mu4e emails by using <em>mml-attach-file</em>, which attaches the file using <em>&lt;#part&gt;…&lt;#/part&gt;</em>. However, the Amazon service did not find the attached pdf, so no pdf was added to my Kindle.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I found a handy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/97abs7/anyone_uses_mu4e_to_send_mobi_files_to_kindle">Reddit thread, leding me to a working solution</a>. Wrapping the part using <em>&lt;#multipart type=mixed&gt;…&lt;#/multipart&gt;</em> did the job, using <em>mml-insert-multipart</em>, followed by <em>mml-attach-file</em>.</p>
<p>Resulting attachment should look something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-example">&lt;#multipart type=mixed&gt;
&lt;#part type=&quot;application/pdf&quot; filename=&quot;/path/to/file.pdf&quot; disposition=attachment&gt;
&lt;#/part&gt;
&lt;#/multipart&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I should add a convenience elisp function for this, but that's for another time…</p>
