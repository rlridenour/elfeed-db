<p id="p1">OpenAI <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/6/openai-devday-live-blog/" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced a lot of developer-related features</a> at yesterday&rsquo;s DevDay event, and as you can imagine, the most interesting one for me is the introduction of apps in ChatGPT. From the <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  Today we&rsquo;re introducing a new generation of apps you can chat with, right inside ChatGPT. Developers can start building them today with the new Apps SDK, available in preview.</p>
<p>  Apps in ChatGPT fit naturally into conversation. You can discover them when ChatGPT suggests one at the right time, or by calling them by name. Apps respond to natural language and include interactive interfaces you can use right in the chat.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p3">And:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  Developers can start building and testing apps today with the new Apps SDK preview, which we&rsquo;re releasing as an open standard built on the Model Context Protocol&#8288; (MCP). To start building, visit our documentation for guidelines and example apps, and then test your apps using Developer Mode in ChatGPT.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">Also:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote6"><p>
  Later this year, we&rsquo;ll launch apps to ChatGPT Business, Enterprise and Edu. We&rsquo;ll also open submissions so developers can publish their apps in ChatGPT, and launch a dedicated directory where users can browse and search for them. Apps that meet the standards provided in our developer guidelines will be eligible to be listed, and those that meet higher design and functionality standards may be featured more prominently&mdash;both in the directory and in conversations.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p7">Looks like we got the timing right with <a href="https://appstories.net/episodes/455" rel="noopener noreferrer">this week&rsquo;s episode of AppStories</a> about demystifying MCP and what it means to connect apps to LLMs. In the episode, I expressed my optimism for the potential of MCP and the idea of augmenting your favorite apps with the capabilities of LLMs. However, I also lamented how fragmented the MCP ecosystem is and how confusing it can be for users to wrap their heads around MCP &ldquo;servers&rdquo; and other obscure, developer-adjacent terminology.</p>
<p id="p8">In classic OpenAI fashion, their announcement of apps in ChatGPT aims to (almost) completely abstract the complexity of MCP from users. In one announcement, OpenAI addressed my two top complaints about MCP that I shared on AppStories: they revealed their own upcoming ecosystem of apps, and they&rsquo;re going to make it simple to use.</p>
<p id="p9">Does that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(Apple)" rel="noopener noreferrer">ring a bell</a>? It&rsquo;s impossible to tell right now if OpenAI&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.platformer.news/openai-dev-day-2025-platform-chatgpt/" rel="noopener noreferrer">bet to become a platform</a> will be successful, but early signs are encouraging, and the company has the leverage of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/sam-altman-says-chatgpt-has-hit-800m-weekly-active-users/" rel="noopener noreferrer">800 million active users</a> to convince third-party developers to jump on board. Just this morning, I asked ChatGPT to put together a custom Spotify playlist with bands that had a similar vibe to Moving Mountains in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneuma_(Moving_Mountains_album)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pneuma</a> era, and after thinking for a few minutes, it worked. I did it from the ChatGPT web app and didn&rsquo;t have to involve the App Store at all.</p>
<p id="p10">If I were Apple, I&rsquo;d start growing <em>increasingly</em> concerned at the prospect of another company controlling the interactions between users and their favorite apps. As I <a href="https://appstories.net/episodes/455" rel="noopener noreferrer">argued</a> on AppStories, my hope is that the rumored MCP framework <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/22/macos-tahoe-26-1-beta-1-mcp-integration/" rel="noopener noreferrer">allegedly being worked on by Apple</a> is exactly that &ndash; a bridge (powered by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Intents</a>) between App Store apps and LLMs that can serve as a stopgap until Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/03/llm-siri-with-search-early-2026/" rel="noopener noreferrer">gets their LLM act together</a>. But that&rsquo;s a story for another time.</p>
