Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/04/apple-launches-new-invites-app/">launched the Invites app</a> back in February, and this is the second update the app has received. In May, Apple added the option to include links in event invitations.<br/>

Invites is an event planning app that supports creating custom invitations with unique background images, fonts, and relevant information like directions and the weather. It also has easy-to-use event managing and RSVP tools.<br/>
<br/>
While Invites is free, it is an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>+ service, so an &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ subscription is required to create an event. &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ plans are priced starting at &#36;0.99 per month, and they include additional &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; storage and features like Private Relay.<br/>
<br/>
Though an &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ subscription is needed for creating an event, anyone can RSVP to an invitation, including those without iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
The Invites app can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.
