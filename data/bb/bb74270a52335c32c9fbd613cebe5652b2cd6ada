<p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney publicly rejected President Donald Trump’s comment at the World Economic Forum in Davos that “Canada lives because of the United States,” saying Canada “thrives” on its own values and strengths. Carney’s response came as he returned to Canada following Davos remarks in which he warned of a “rupture” in the U.S.-led rules-based global order and encouraged cooperation among “middle powers” to withstand economic coercion. The exchange has intensified attention on the U.S.–Canada relationship and, in Canada, has coincided with a rallying effect around Carney and renewed calls for national unity.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Y12lM_qyw7W8WBulCGFoTWjK_E9kJCao3CNrpA_OQ4L3_Cs10U7e4dzmkayHkKmzle-kE-hge6mN2MTy7-u_A-JHdw3NpDYNOkcWj08xxp5psf-rk7K-WmC6y4psYgUdRNF95Kep8PWaYGVRIfiuDeaFvTh3tj6-ppMRsUn31nCLlD1eL2lc2_YummC091Hj' alt='Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada at a news conference in Quebec City on Thursday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Quebec address: Carney delivered a national address from a historic military fortress in Quebec City, framing unity as essential amid a shifting world order and domestic challenges.</li><li>‘Carney Doctrine’: At Davos, Carney’s speech—described by one outlet as the “Carney Doctrine”—criticized great-power use of economic “coercion” and drew a standing ovation, according to reporting on the event.</li><li>Middle-power coordination: Carney used his post-Davos message to urge “middle powers” to work together in resisting President Trump, positioning Canada as part of a broader coalition-building effort.</li><li>Domestic politics: Coverage noted President Trump’s rhetoric has helped consolidate Canadian support for Carney, adding a domestic political dimension to the cross-border dispute.</li></ul><blockquote>Canada doesn’t live because of the United States. - Mark Carney</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Canada (Prime Minister Mark Carney): Carney rejected the idea that Canada depends for its existence on the U.S., arguing Canada thrives because of Canadian values and urging unity at home and cooperation among middle powers abroad.
