In an interview this week <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/17/cnbc-sport-mlb-commissioner-says-sunday-media-rights-could-go-to-nbc-apple-or-espn.html">with <em>CNBC</em>'s Alex Sherman</a>, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred confirmed that Apple, NBC, and ESPN have each bid on the media rights to MLB's "Sunday Night Baseball" package, for the 2026 through 2028 seasons.<br/>

Manfred said he plans to choose a winning bidder for "Sunday Night Baseball" within the month, and the rights could be split up between two bidders.<br/>
<br/>
ESPN held the rights to "Sunday Night Baseball" through the 2028 season, but the network and MLB mutually opted out of the &#36;550-million contract earlier this year, so ESPN's rights now expire after the 2025 season. Apple is now looking to pick up those final three seasons, along with NBC, and even ESPN is looking to renegotiate a deal.<br/>
<br/>
Apple TV+ already streams MLB's Friday Night Baseball games, and the service could offer Sunday Night Baseball too if Apple wins the rights.<br/>
<br/>
Following the 2028 season, all regional and national MLB media rights will be expired, and the league is hoping to table a bigger all-in-one package of rights. Apple would likely be very interested in such a package, as it would allow the company to offer an MLB equivalent of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/apple-promotes-mls-season-pass-after-super-bowl/">MLS Season Pass</a> through the Apple TV app. However, MLB is much bigger than MLS, so it remains to be seen if MLB would be willing to go all-in with Apple.<br/>

Apple continues to push into sports content, with the company reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/14/apple-expected-to-win-rights-to-f1/">likely to secure the rights to Formula 1 racing</a>.
