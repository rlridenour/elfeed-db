<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 4 licenses ($8.99 value each) for <a href="https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/mac/">Yoink</a>. This might be the last app in the series, I think &mdash; it&rsquo;s been a good run (for over a year and a half!). Eternal Storms software is offering 4 licenses for their excellent utility, Yoink. Yoink puts a shelf on your desktop to which you can drag items, and then drag them out later. Why? It allows you to collect files from different places to move, copy, or otherwise act on all at once, and it can make it much simpler to drag files between apps, windows, and spaces. It&rsquo;s really handy, and you&rsquo;ll start realizing that right away.</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yoink offers a &ldquo;shelf&rdquo; for files and app-content you want to move or copy.</p>

  <p>Virtually anything you can drag on your Mac, Yoink can hold for you until you need it.</p>

  <p>From files in Finder to app-content (like text from word processors or images from websites), Yoink has got you covered.</p>
