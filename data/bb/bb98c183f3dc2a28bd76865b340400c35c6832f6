<p>In a recent email, a professor of philosophy asked for a discussion about the ethics of using AI in philosophical research, and institutional policies about it.</p>
<p>He adds: &#8220;My instinct is to hold my students to the same standards that I would expect of my colleagues.&#8221;</p>
<p>While that is one possible conclusion we might land upon, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a particularly good place to <em>start</em>, since there seem to be relevant differences between student coursework and scholarly research (e.g., the purpose of the work, the roles of the agents, etc.).</p>
<p>Better, it seems, to consider the nature of scholarly research, the aims people have for undertaking it, the institutional functions it serves, and so on, and try to figure out the extent to which various uses of AI fit, if at all, with those things. And I think it would be good to take seriously from the beginning of this inquiry the possibility that a clean and neat answer is unlikely to be the best one.</p>
<p>There are different ways researchers in philosophy might use AI in their work, now, and with some improvements to the technology, in the future. Here are some examples (feel free to add more in the comments):</p>
<ul>
<li>chat or brainstorm with it about your ideas, as you would with a colleague</li>
<li>make stylistic edits to your writing to enhance comprehensibility</li>
<li>format bibliographic information</li>
<li>draft an index</li>
<li>draw out the structure of and check the validity of an argument you&#8217;ve made</li>
<li>search through articles and other resources to see which will be useful for a specific project</li>
<li>raise objections to an argument you&#8217;ve written</li>
<li>explain technical work in relevant empirical fields</li>
<li>create examples, counterexamples, and thought experiments</li>
<li>write abstracts of papers</li>
<li>ask about the implications of your thesis for other questions</li>
<li>have it analyze a paper you&#8217;ve written and provide detailed outlines of other papers you could easily write based on the ideas of the first</li>
<li>co-author substantive text with it, as you would with a human co-author (some of the resultant passages are written solely by the AI, some by you, some a mix)</li>
</ul>
<p>Which of these are okay? Which not? Why?</p>
<p>In addition to the question of which specific tasks a researcher might acceptably have an AI perform, there is the question of disclosure. What kinds of AI assistance must researchers acknowledge in their talks, articles, and books? What form should such acknowledgement take? And what&#8217;s at the intersection here? Might all AI use be permitted so long as it is disclosed? Or are there other considerations here besides transparency?</p>
<p>Beyond what&#8217;s permitted, there&#8217;s the question of evaluation&#8212;of works and of authors. To what extent may/should one&#8217;s use of AI be taken into account when it comes to questions of accepting manuscripts for publication, or for hiring, tenure, promotion, honors, and awards? (&#8220;Yes, they have an article in PPR, but it was co-authored with Chat-GPT, so does it really count?&#8221;) (See this <a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/06/24/ai-generated-content-and-academic-journals/">earlier discussion</a> of journal policies about AI use.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more, but perhaps that&#8217;s enough to get us started. Discussion welcome.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/08/19/the-ethics-of-using-ai-in-philosophical-research/">The Ethics of Using AI in Philosophical Research</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
