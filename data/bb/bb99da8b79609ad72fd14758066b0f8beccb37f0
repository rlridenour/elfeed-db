  <li><strong>iPhone 17 Air:</strong> All-new model with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/iphone-17-air-list-of-17-rumored-features/">ultra-thin and lightweight design</a>, 6.6-inch display, A19 chip, 12GB of RAM, single 48-megapixel rear camera, 24-megapixel front camera, single speaker, and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/">optional battery case</a>.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro:</strong> A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/iphone-17-pro-with-16-rumored-features/">redesigned rear camera bump</a> with a trio of 48-megapixel cameras, an aluminum frame, an A19 Pro chip, 12GB of RAM, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/iphone-17-rumored-colors-list/">orange or copper color option</a>, and potentially a vapor chamber cooling system.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max:</strong> All of the iPhone 17 Pro features listed above, plus a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/05/iphone-17-pro-max-vs-pro/">slightly thicker design</a> for a larger and longer-lasting battery.</li></ul><h2>Apple Watches</h2><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Complications.jpg" alt="" width="1120" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007675" /><br/>
<ul><li><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 3:</strong> A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-watch-ultra-3-display-size/">slightly larger display</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/02/apple-watch-ultra-3-on-track-for-this-year/">5G support</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/02/apple-watch-ultra-3-on-track-for-this-year/">satellite connectivity</a> for sending and receiving text messages in supported areas without Wi-Fi and cellular coverage. Other likely upgrades include an S10 chip or newer, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that is brighter at an angle.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Apple Watch Series 11:</strong> Spec-bump year with an S11 chip and smaller changes, following bigger design updates with the Series 10 last year. iOS 26 beta code apparently includes references to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/22/sleep-score-apple-watch-ios-26/">unreleased "Sleep Score" feature</a> that could be exclusive to the next Apple Watch models.</li><br/>

The device was rumored to feature a plastic case in bright color options, but that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/23/plastic-apple-watch-se-in-jeopardy/">might not be happening anymore</a>. Not many rumors beyond that yet, but the Apple Watch SE has not been updated since 2022, so it has many features to catch up on.</li></ul><h2>M5 Chip Devices</h2><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
Both the <strong>iPad Pro</strong> and the <strong>Vision Pro</strong> are expected to be updated with an M5 chip this year.<br/>
<br/>
The next iPad Pro will reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">also be equipped with two front cameras</a>, for both portrait and landscape orientations, while the updated Vision Pro will reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/apple-vision-pro-2025-features/">come with a new head strap</a> that makes it easier to wear the headset for extended periods.<br/>
<br/>
No other major design changes are expected for these devices.<br/>
<br/>
The first Macs with the M5 series of chips were initially expected in 2025, but recent rumors suggest they <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/macbook-pro-with-m5-chips-2026-rumor/">might not launch until 2026</a>.</ul><h2>Home and Accessories</h2><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/HomePod-mini-and-Apple-TV.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984533" /><br/>

A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">built-in FaceTime camera</a> has been rumored for a future Apple TV, but it is unclear if that will arrive with the next model.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>HomePod mini (2nd generation):</strong> Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip with Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7 support, and likely improved sound quality.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>AirTag (2nd generation):</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/airtag-2-longer-range-rumor/">Up to 3× longer item tracking range</a> vs. current AirTag, and a more tamper-proof speaker as an anti-stalking measure.</li></ul><h2>Wild Cards</h2><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/studio-display-purple.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988708" /><br/>
<ul><li><strong>AirPods Pro 3:</strong> Updated design and improved active noise cancellation, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/16/airpods-pro-3-not-launching-until-next-year/">rumors have been conflicting</a> about a 2025 or 2026 launch.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Studio Display 2:</strong> New model with mini-LED backlighting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/studio-display-2-rumor-recap/">in late 2025 or early 2026</a>.</li></ul>There may also new accessories, such as an updated version of the MagSafe Charger for iPhones and new Beats products.<br/>
