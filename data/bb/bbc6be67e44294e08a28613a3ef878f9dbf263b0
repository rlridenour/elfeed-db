<p>Joaquín Guzmán López, a son of jailed Mexican drug trafficker Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán, has pleaded guilty in a Chicago federal court to drug trafficking, running a continuing criminal enterprise, and participating in the kidnapping of a senior Sinaloa cartel boss believed to be Ismael &quot;El Mayo&quot; Zambada García. Prosecutors say Guzmán López helped supervise large‑scale production and smuggling of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States, reversing an earlier not‑guilty plea he entered after his July 2024 arrest in Texas. As part of a deal, US authorities agreed not to seek the death penalty, and he now faces a lengthy prison term to be determined at a later sentencing hearing. The plea marks another step in US and Mexican efforts to weaken the Sinaloa cartel leadership, coming months after one of Guzmán López’s brothers also accepted a plea agreement in a separate US case.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/rl2o-rtWe8U_oAdg6Ld2Fu4LXeR2ryktVvOdDzQehezi53LNwXTODWc-T9hGPXx2N0yonQxpkY2UzUQtwKUKjT8G6f02Q4cHjxycHObec776mxAVun2H3izs_l98CfJyU1eKlEHxpnQciADn_HM3wMZkqzdmKnbRsciULDW7PhnRKu9Vhxz2H4wY' alt='A plane in New Mexico believed to have been used in the kidnapping and transfer of Sinaloa cartel leader Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García to US custody.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Kidnapping allegation: In court filings, Guzmán López admitted involvement in the abduction of a powerful Sinaloa capo identified as Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who was allegedly drugged, flown on a private aircraft from Mexico into New Mexico, and then transferred into US custody.</li><li>Scope of trafficking: Prosecutors say the operation Guzmán López helped oversee involved industrial‑scale labs producing methamphetamine, coordination of maritime and land routes, and distribution networks that pushed synthetic opioids such as fentanyl into US cities.</li><li>Ongoing cooperation: The plea agreement requires Guzmán López to provide information to US authorities, with prosecutors telling the court the deal could help them pursue further investigations into the Sinaloa cartel’s leadership and finances.</li><li>Family network: Guzmán López is one of four sons known as “Los Chapitos,” who prosecutors describe as having taken on key roles in the Sinaloa cartel after their father’s extradition and life sentence in the United States.</li><li>Legal protections: Alongside the pledge not to pursue capital punishment, the US government agreed that Guzmán López will serve any eventual sentence in a federal facility rather than being transferred to another country, according to plea‑hearing accounts.</li></ul><blockquote>He admitted to helping oversee the production and smuggling of large quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana and fentanyl into the United States. - US federal prosecutor (as summarized in charging documents)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US prosecutors: Prosecutors portrayed Guzmán López as a high‑level organizer who coordinated drug production and smuggling routes for the Sinaloa cartel and argued that his cooperation could assist in targeting other leaders.
