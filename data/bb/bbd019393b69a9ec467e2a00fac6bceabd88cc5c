Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-vision-pro-upgraded-with-the-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band/">updated</a> the Vision Pro headset with its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-unveils-m5-chip-with-next-generation-gpu/">next-generation M5 chip</a> for faster performance, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/new-accessories-for-vision-pro-now-available/">more comfortable Dual Knit Band</a>.<br/>
<br/>

The M5 chip has a 10-core CPU, a 10-core GPU with Neural Accelerators, and a 16-core Neural Engine, and we have confirmed the Vision Pro still has 16GB of RAM.<br/>
<br/>
With the M5 chip, the Vision Pro offers faster performance and longer battery life compared to the previous model with the M2 chip. Apple has not provided any overall performance figures, but its website says the Vision Pro now offers up to three hours of video playback per charge, compared to up to 2.5 hours for the previous model.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the M5 chip enables the rendering of 10% more pixels on the displays compared to the previous model, resulting in sharper images and crisper text. And the Vision Pro can now ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/vision-pro-100hz-refresh-rate/">up from the previous limit of 100Hz</a>. Apple says 120Hz support reduces motion blur and provides a smoother experience when using Mac Virtual Display.<br/>
<br/>
With the M5 chip, the Vision Pro gains hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, for improved graphics rendering. These capabilities were first introduced with the M3 chip, but the previous Vision Pro only had an M2 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the M5 chip's faster 16-core Neural Engine, and a Neural Accelerator in each GPU core, make AI features run up to 50% faster than on the previous model.<br/>
<br/>
The updated Vision Pro still has an R1 chip for input processing. The headset continues to support Wi-Fi 6, rather than Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
There are no design changes or new color options, such as the rumored Space Black. There is still a tethered battery pack, rather than a built-in battery.<br/>

The updated Vision Pro comes with the Dual Knit Band, a Light Seal, two Light Seal Cushions, a cover for the front of the device, a polishing cloth, a battery, a USB-C charging cable, and Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/apple-40w-to-60w-charger-key-advantage/">40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The previous Vision Pro came with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/12/apple-stops-selling-30w-usb-c-power-adapter/">discontinued 30W USB-C Power Adapter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The new Dual Knit Band comes in small, medium, and large sizes. It is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/DUAL_KNIT_BAND_SA/apple-vision-pro-dual-knit-band">available to purchase separately for &#36;99</a>, and it is compatible with the previous-generation Vision Pro.

Apple says the Dual Knit Band features two straps knitted into a single piece. The upper strap goes across the top of the head, and the lower strap goes across the back of the head. The lower strap has tungsten inserts that provide a counterweight for additional comfort, balance, and stability. You can adjust the fit of both of the straps with the Fit Dial.<br/>
<br/>
Another new accessory is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/new-accessories-for-vision-pro-now-available/">Logitech Muse spatial stylus</a>, and Apple will begin selling the PlayStation VR2 Sense controller starting Tuesday, November 11.<br/>
<br/>
The updated Vision Pro is available to pre-order starting today, and it will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Wednesday, October 22.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., the Vision Pro continues to start at &#36;3,499, and it can be configured with 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage. The new model is also available in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the U.K., and the United Arab Emirates. Availability in South Korea and Taiwan will begin at a later date, according to Apple.<br/>
