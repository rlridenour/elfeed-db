<p>I've loved my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soundmagic-PL30-In-Ear-Headphones/dp/B001MQ3CCO">Soundmagic PL30 in-ear headphones</a>. They're relatively inexpensive, comfortable, and great for exercising (they stay in). Audio quality and bass have been good enough (I don't need much). Unfortunately, I've had two pairs of PL30's and both stopped working after a year or two. I'm replacing the last pair with <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/RHA-MA750-Isolating-In-Ear-Headphone-Black/dp/B00ELAM8LE">RHA's MA750</a> (an upgrade, me hopes).</p>
<p>Other contenders considered: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Etymotic-Research-Portable-iPhone-Earphones-Black/dp/B000XPG2QI">Etymotic Research HF5</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shure-SE215-In-Ear-Isolating-Earphones-Clear/dp/B004U9NH3E">Shure SE215</a>. Also considered bluetooth alternatives like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JayBird-BlueBuds-Sport-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B00AIRUOI8?">JayBird BlueBuds X</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Plantronics-BackBeat-Wireless-Earbuds-Frustration-Black/dp/B00DZTHW9U">Plantronics BackBeat GO 2</a>.</p>
<p>I'm somewhat nervous to pay more for a pair of headphones. Let's hope they don't meet the same unfortunate fate. We'll see.</p>
