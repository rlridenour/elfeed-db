<p>The <strong><a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/enhanced-evil-paredit.el">enhanced-evil-paredit</a></strong> package prevents parenthesis imbalance when using <em>evil-mode</em> with <em>paredit</em>. It intercepts <em>evil-mode</em> commands such as delete, change, and paste, blocking their execution if they would break the parenthetical structure. This guarantees that your Lisp code remains syntactically correct while retaining the editing features of <em>evil-mode</em>.</p>

## Frequently asked questions

### What are the differences between enhanced-evil-paredit and evil-paredit?

The `enhanced-evil-paredit` package is a modernized version of `evil-paredit`. It has been enhanced and fully functions in recent versions of Emacs (Emacs &gt;= 28). The author decided to develop `enhanced-evil-paredit` because the `evil-paredit` package is no longer maintained and does not function in recent versions of Emacs and Evil.

Here are the enhancements in `enhanced-evil-paredit`:
* Handles paste using `p` and `P`, ensuring that the pasted text has balanced parentheses.
* Fix call to a non-existent function `(evil-called-interactively-p)`, which has been replaced by `(called-interactively-p 'any)`.
* Add new functions: `enhanced-evil-paredit-backward-delete` and `enhanced-evil-paredit-forward-delete`.
* `enhanced-evil-paredit-mode` only uses the paredit functions when `paredit-mode` is enabled. It acts as a wrapper that delegates commands to Paredit when Paredit is enabled and otherwise uses standard Evil commands. (The difference in behavior is that with `paredit-mode`, structural editing operations preserve balanced parentheses and Lisp structure, whereas without `paredit-mode`, the same operations rely on Evil motions and can disrupt parentheses and overall code structure.)
* Add lexical binding with `lexical-binding: t`.
* Suppress Emacs Lisp warnings and add Melpa tests.
* Refactor and improve `enhanced-evil-paredit`.
* Create a `enhanced-evil-paredit` customization group for user configuration.
* Remove Evil state change from `enhanced-evil-paredit-mode`.
* Improve error handling in `enhanced-evil-paredit-check-region`.
* Enhance docstrings.
* Remove keymap bindings that are reserved by Emacs.
* Add `&amp;optional` after the `end` argument to make it similar to Evil functions.
- `dd` restores the column when there is a parentheses mismatch.

The pathaction command-line tool enables the execution of specific commands on targeted files or directories. Its key advantage lies in its flexibility, allowing users to handle various types of files simply by passing the file or directory as an argument to the pathaction tool. The tool uses a .pathaction.yaml rule-set file to determine which command to execute. Additionally, Jinja2 templating can be employed in the rule-set file to further customize the commands.
- [kirigami.el](https://github.com/jamescherti/kirigami.el): The *kirigami* Emacs package offers a unified interface for opening and closing folds across a diverse set of major and minor modes in Emacs, including `outline-mode`, `outline-minor-mode`, `outline-indent-mode`, `org-mode`, `markdown-mode`, `vdiff-mode`, `vdiff-3way-mode`, `hs-minor-mode`, `hide-ifdef-mode`, `origami-mode`, `yafolding-mode`, `folding-mode`, and `treesit-fold-mode`. With Kirigami, folding key bindings only need to be configured **once**. After that, the same keys work consistently across all supported major and minor modes, providing a unified and predictable folding experience.</code></pre></div>
