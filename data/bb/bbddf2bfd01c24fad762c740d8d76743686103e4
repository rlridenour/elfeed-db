<p>Ukrainian security services say domestically produced naval drones struck two Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea, damaging vessels that Kyiv describes as part of Moscow’s &quot;shadow fleet&quot; used to move oil despite Western sanctions. The tankers, identified as Kairos and Virat, were reportedly sailing empty toward the Russian port of Novorossiysk to load crude for export when they were hit. Ukrainian officials frame the attack as an effort to pressure Russia’s oil revenues that help finance its military campaign, while Russian authorities have not publicly detailed the extent of damage or any casualties in the initial reports. Video released by Ukraine appears to show sea drones homing in on the ships at night, underscoring how both sides have increasingly turned to unmanned systems to contest control of Black Sea trade routes.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/IJzbvZ_GF4i3dQR9IZvaGtPA2MV-Yjc5l7aG1_C02mgwEYT2JrmlGZJSh1OQ5z8i2pVD_WVqvpjRix3uexgDZ_2ez_jqkPse8K2u4RAmSwxCGFfKKPOzm3LpkQkhmuBWYADlZW2e4uVn-U0G9--Ae9VmF53IcMDmHi9cmiLQKqGGDVTLbeoRO1nJWvzgXlc47JKINzEmBvfQo6m84_SAwPmEasBqOn0VDCTr9MK7pTdZe7ba29u9v1i0faFaDq8-9aGRjERkMAw9pacXUaj7laE' alt='A view of a tanker at sea in the Black Sea region, as Ukraine increasingly uses naval drones against Russian-linked shipping.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Targeted vessels: The two tankers, Kairos and Virat, were described by Ukrainian security officials as operating under sanctions and allegedly involved in transporting Russian oil to foreign markets outside regular channels.</li><li>Use of sea drones: Ukraine’s security service said the operation used domestically manufactured naval drones, and later released night-vision-style footage that appears to show the drones closing in on large ships before impact.</li><li>Shadow fleet context: The term &quot;shadow fleet&quot; generally refers to tankers that turn off tracking systems, change flags, or rely on complex ownership structures to move oil from sanctioned countries without attracting enforcement, a practice Western governments have accused Russia of expanding since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</li><li>Escalation at sea: The strike fits into a broader pattern in which Ukraine has increasingly targeted Russian naval assets and logistics in the Black Sea to disrupt supply lines and limit Moscow’s ability to export energy by sea.</li><li>Civilian shipping risks: Analysts and shipping observers have warned that attacks on commercial tankers, even when empty, add security risks and insurance costs for all cargo vessels in contested waters such as the Black Sea.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukrainian security service (SBU): Ukrainian security officials described the tankers as sanctioned ships headed to Novorossiysk to load oil for foreign markets and presented the strike as part of efforts to undermine Russian oil exports that help finance its war effort.
