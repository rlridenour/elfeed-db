<p>Czech politician and businessman Andrej Babiš has been sworn in as prime minister for a second, non-consecutive term after his ANO movement won October’s parliamentary election and formed a coalition with the SPD and AUTO parties in Prague. The new coalition agreement signals a shift in the Czech Republic’s stance on the war in Ukraine, with Babiš and his partners pledging to end government financing of weapons for Kyiv and instead prioritize domestic spending and diplomacy. The governing parties also presented a strongly Eurosceptic platform, arguing that the European Union should not impose decisions that, in their view, limit national sovereignty, and promising to resist EU plans on migration and carbon-emissions reduction. Babiš, who faces an ongoing fraud case involving the use of EU funds, used his inauguration speech to promise that he would defend the interests of all Czech citizens and work to make the country “the best place to live on the entire planet”.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qF9958aCuetDS73lwXqyBiruXwoiP-NvwXEEKXTAwlsdkVd49JE8P4WpHG2cF-0EITYC_OVJFk3Hhg8WtlUEjp9KfzGb9bUirvJlNekPe3WU_sauhjVTVj14xkJucXzwfFpyqye-c-HbkPAqfIlhhIjby2ISyzN2GsFUHeuq1g' alt='Andrej Babiš takes the oath of office as the Czech Republic’s new prime minister during a ceremony in Prague.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Coalition makeup: Babiš’s ANO movement joined forces with the SPD and AUTO parties to secure a parliamentary majority, after ANO finished first in the October election but short of outright control of the legislature.</li><li>Ukraine aid reversal: The coalition’s policy declaration states that the government will not allocate money from the Czech state budget for arms to Ukraine, reversing the previous cabinet’s role in organizing large-scale international munitions acquisitions for Kyiv.</li><li>EU policy stance: The new government plans to challenge Brussels on issues including Ukraine support, energy rules, value-added tax and tariff matters, while rejecting EU migration policy and opposing further centralization of decision-making at the EU level.</li><li>Links to Trump: Media in the region highlight that Babiš is a political ally and supporter of US President Donald Trump, with his return seen as part of a broader realignment of some Central European governments toward Washington but away from certain EU policies.</li><li>Legal proceedings: Babiš assumes office while under trial in a long-running case over alleged misuse of European Union subsidies, a matter that has drawn concern from some EU officials about governance and rule-of-law standards in Prague.</li></ul><blockquote>I promise that I will be a Prime Minister who defends the interests of all our citizens at home and abroad, and… who will work to make the Czech Republic the best place to live on the entire planet - Andrej Babiš</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Andrej Babiš: Babiš says his priority is to fight for Czech interests “at home and anywhere in the world” and to focus government efforts on making life better for citizens across the country.
