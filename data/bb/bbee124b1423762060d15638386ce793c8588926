<blockquote><p>
Naturalists state that snakes, when in danger, have been known to swallow each other; the above three snakes have just commenced to perform this operation. The snakes are from the same &#8216;hatch,&#8217; and are therefore equal in age, length, weight, &#038;c. They all start at scratch &#8212; that is, commence swallowing simultaneously. They are twirling round at the express rate of 300 revolutions per minute, during which time the circumference is decreased by 1 inch.</p>
<p>We would like our readers to tell us what will be the final result? Heads or tails, and how many of each?
