In some ways this article should come under "applications", as
it's mainly concerned with using Lisp to represent and manipulate
music. Indeed, it presents a system that can be used to perform
all sorts of common transformations of the tones and timing of a
piece. It's easy to see how the resulting system could be used to
compose and then to drive instruments, for example through a MIDI
interface.

The music perspective is however secondary to the goal of teaching
and showcasing Lisp through the medium of a realistic example of
symbolic programming. It covers a lot of ground, starting with
lists and functions and including first-class functions and
combinators as means of implementing the musical structures. It's
a great piece of pedagogy that treats the application and the
language as closely linked, and not shying-away from some quite
advanced techniques that have clear applications in the domain. It
would be great to see this used as a basis for actual musical
composition and performance.
