 
          <p>For those of you who are living under a rock, Valve announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">three new hardware devices</a> joining their Steam Deck line-up: a new controller, a VR headset, and the GameCube&mdash;no wait, GabeCube&mdash;no wait, Steam Machine. The shiny little cube is undoubtedly Valve&rsquo;s (second) attempt to break into the console market. This time, it might just work.</p>
<p>The hardware is ready to arrive in at your living room spring next year. The biggest question is: will it arrive at <em>our</em> living room? Reading all the hype has certainly enthused me (e.g. Brendon&rsquo;s <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-steam-machine-is-the-future">The Steam Machine is the Future</a>, PC Gamer&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/steamos-launching-for-arm-fex-translation-layer/">Valve is all over ARM</a>, Eurogamer&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">Steam Machine preview</a>, ResetEra&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-hardware-family-officially-expands-in-early-2026-steam-controller-steam-machine-steam-frame.1351453/">Steam Hardware thread</a>); especially the part where the Machine is just a PC that happens to be tailored towards console gaming. According to Valve, you can install anything you want on it&mdash;it&rsquo;s just SteamOS just like your trusty Deck, meaning you can boot into KDE and totally do your thing. Except that this shiny little cube is six times as powerful. I&rsquo;m sure Digital Foundry will validate that next year.</p>

<p>However, this post isn&rsquo;t about specs, expectations, or dreams: it&rsquo;s about tempering my own enthusiasm. I&rsquo;d like to tell myself why I don&rsquo;t really need a Steam Machine. The following list will hopefully make it easier to say no when the buy buttons become available.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>You&rsquo;re a retro gamer.</em> <br/>You don&rsquo;t need the power of six Steam Decks. To do what, run DOSBox?</li>
<li><em>Your TV doesn&rsquo;t support 4K</em>.<br/>Again, no need for those 4K 60 FPS.</li>
<li><em>You generally dislike AAA games.</em> <br/>With The Steam Machine, you might be able to finally properly run <em>DOOM Eternal</em> and all of the <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> games. That you don&rsquo;t like playing.</li>
<li><em>You don&rsquo;t have time to play games anyway.</em><br/>Ouch, that hurts but it&rsquo;s not untrue.</li>
<li><em>The TV will be occupied anyway.</em><br/>The Steam Machine is not a Switch: you can&rsquo;t switch to handheld mode. When are you going to play on the Machine if the TV is being used to watch your wife&rsquo;s favourite shows?</li>
<li><em>You already have too many gaming related hardware pieces.</em><br/>That&rsquo;ll mean you&rsquo;ll have to divide your time by an even bigger number to devote an equal amount to playing them.</li>
<li><em>There&rsquo;s no room for yet another nondescript box under the TV.</em><br/>See above: why don&rsquo;t you first try to do something with that SNES Mini and PlayStation Mini besides letting it collect dust?</li>
<li><em>You&rsquo;re a physical gamer.</em><br/>This is Steam. There will be no insertion of cartridges, no blowing of carts, and no staring at game collections on a shelf.</li>
<li><em>It&rsquo;s Steam, not Good Old Games.</em><br/>Sure it can run GOG games but the Machine is primarily designed to run Steam. You avoid purchasing from Steam like the plague, yet you&rsquo;re willing to buy a Machine dedicated to it? Are you crazy?</li>
<li><em>The last time you booted Steam was over a year ago.</em><br/>Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re suddenly interested in running the platform on a dedicated machine.</li>
<li><em>You don&rsquo;t have time to fiddle with configuration.</em><br/>Button and trackpad mappings to get the controls just right enough to play strategy games designed to be played with keyboard and mouse will only leave you frustrated.</li>
<li><em>Your MacBook can emulate Windows games just fine.</em><br/>You recently bought CrossOver and played <em>Wizordum</em> and older Windows 98/XP stuff on it. It even runs <em>Against The Storm</em> flawlessly. No need for Proton or whatever.</li>
<li><em>In two years, you&rsquo;ll upgrade your M1 to an M4+: there&rsquo;s the power upgrade.</em><br/>If CrossOver is struggling to run that particular game you so badly want to play, it&rsquo;ll be buttery smooth in a few years. You&rsquo;re going to do the laptop upgrade anyway regardless of the Steam Machine.</li>
<li><em>You already have a huge gaming backlog.</em><br/>Thanks to your buddy Joel you bought too many physical Switch games that are still waiting to be touched. Are you really ready to open up another can of worms?</li>
<li><em>You dislike a digital backlog.</em><br/>It&rsquo;s easy to have hundreds of games on there: see your GOG purchases. Why don&rsquo;t you try to count the ones that you actually played, let alone finished.</li>
<li><em>You&rsquo;re not going to use the Machine to run office software.</em><br/>Your laptop and other retro machines are good enough at handling that task. What are you really going to do with this cube besides gaming?</li>
<li><em>Those cool looking indie games will be released for Switch in due time anyway.</em><br/>Remember <em>Pizza Tower</em>? It&rsquo;s out on Switch now. Remember to buy the cart on Fangamer, together with the <em>Anton Blast</em> one.</li>
<li><em>It&rsquo;s rumoured to cost more than</em> <code>€600</code>.<br/>Save that money for a Switch 2 if the games are starting to become interesting to justify that upgrade, as currently, they&rsquo;re not. Also, see the backlog point above.</li>
<li><em>All HDMI ports both on the TV and your external monitors are occupied</em>.<br/>Unless you&rsquo;re willing to constantly switch cables, you&rsquo;ll need to invest in a HDMI switch. Another <code>€100+</code>.</li>
<li><em>You can&rsquo;t buy this without buying the Steam Controller.</em><br/>That&rsquo;s easily another <code>€80+</code> you already spent buying the Mobapad controller for your Switch as a replacement for the semi-broken Joy Cons.</li>
<li><em>You can&rsquo;t buy this as an expense on the company.</em><br/>You&rsquo;re closing down the company, remember. (More on that later)</li>
<li><em>The cool looking LED and programmable front display don&rsquo;t justify an expensive purchase.</em><br/>After the initial excitement wears off, the LED will become annoying and you&rsquo;ll simply turn it off.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you see, I don&rsquo;t really need a Steam Machine&hellip;</p>
<p>Fuck it, I&rsquo;m getting one.</p>
