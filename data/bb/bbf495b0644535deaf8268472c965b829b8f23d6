This eBook is DRM-free and yours to read any way you like, on your preferred eReader or eBook app. While the web version is a great way to read the review, we know a lot of Club members value the flexibility of reading it as an eBook, where you can jot down notes, highlight passages, and take a closer look at images.</p>
<p id="p19">Club members can access the eBook version of Federico&rsquo;s review via <a href="https://macstories.memberful.com/account/downloads" rel="noopener noreferrer">their personal Downloads page</a>.</p>

<p id="p21">This Saturday, we&rsquo;ll publish <strong>a special edition of MacStories Weekly</strong>, our exclusive newsletter for Club members, featuring an in-depth look at the making of Federico&rsquo;s iOS and iPadOS 26 review. Federico&rsquo;s workflow changed drastically this year, so there&rsquo;s a lot to dive into. This edition will include details on the following:</p>
<ul id="ul22"><li>How Federico researched, wrote, and edited the story entirely in Notion</li>
<li>The role of assistive AI for research, compiling the review, and more (with examples of different LLMs Federico used and prompts he created)</li>
<li>Federico&rsquo;s use of Drafts for note-taking and Markdown</li>
<li>The various MCP integrations Federico used for the review</li>
</ul><p id="p23">If you enjoy the review and want to learn more about how it came together, this is the way to do it. It&rsquo;s a great peek behind the curtain of MacStories&rsquo; biggest project of the year.</p>

</ul><h2 id="club-macstories-plus-and-premier-perks">Club MacStories Plus and Premier Perks</h2>
<p id="p28">We&rsquo;ve got even more benefits in store for Club Plus and Premier members.</p>
<p id="p29">Next week, Club Plus and Premier members will receive <strong>a collection of Drafts actions</strong> used by Federico to make the review. These actions were a key part of the review process, and they can be adapted to fit a variety of setups. Members can take these custom actions and use them to make their own Drafts workflows better.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/monday-15-sep-2025-14-41-16-1757940144209.png" alt="A selection of Apple Intelligence shortcuts that will be released next week."><p class="image-caption">A selection of Apple Intelligence shortcuts that will be released next week.</p></div>
<p id="p31">Also next week, Federico will publish a new lesson in the Automation Academy for Club Plus and Premier members centered on <strong>Apple Intelligence shortcuts</strong> in iOS and iPadOS 26. This series of advanced shortcuts will showcase the new &lsquo;Use Model&rsquo; action and teach members how to take advantage of it themselves, with lots of examples of integrating the action with third-party apps and common workflows. The &lsquo;Use Model&rsquo; action opens up a lot of possibilities for automation on iOS and iPadOS, and this lesson is a great place to get started with it.</p>
<p id="p32">Of course, we&rsquo;ve got a whole lineup of OS reviews coming this week, including John&rsquo;s review of macOS 26 Tahoe, Jonathan&rsquo;s review of watchOS 26, and a review of visionOS 26 from yours truly. In addition to the eBook version of Federico&rsquo;s review, Club Plus and Premier members will receive <strong>eBook editions of all of this year&rsquo;s MacStories OS reviews</strong> as they are published. These eBooks offer members the opportunity to read every review in whatever way they prefer.</p>
<p id="p33">Club Plus and Premier members will be able to access the eBook versions of all of this year&rsquo;s reviews via <a href="https://macstories.memberful.com/account/downloads" rel="noopener noreferrer">their personal Downloads page</a> later this week.</p>
