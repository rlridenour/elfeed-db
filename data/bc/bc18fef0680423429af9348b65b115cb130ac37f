<p>Syria is commemorating one year since forces led by now‑President Ahmed al‑Sharaa seized Damascus and Bashar al‑Assad fled to Russia, ending nearly 14 years of war and decades of family rule. Massive celebrations, including military parades and gatherings in Damascus’s Umayyad Square, highlight hopes for a “Liberation Day” era of political freedom, open cultural life and safer streets after years of repression and bombardment. The anniversary also reveals deep strains: inflation, damaged infrastructure and ongoing insecurity leave many Syrians struggling to afford basics, while slow progress on transitional justice and reports of new abuses have weakened confidence that past crimes will be addressed. Still, nearly 1.8 million internally displaced people and about 780,000 refugees have chosen to return in the past year, a sign that many see enough improvement to try rebuilding their lives at home despite the risks.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/UQE5rBuKMFAYVtXAE3KXoGvM93A_r3TuKyZODUAwAvDpkqe1AsKUDE5xq8jhLVMpuXLJNqdZhgG5JC8S4wALiNhZEn0XolhoUBaerSY5qh0DW6YkNZFhVzZumzhnPjvGrNv0GtlXnz1TS4rJTU0MJNjPQKqhEOZCtbntX_SJ0oiTc_KrfvqgfvWoOhi1dXdnMdRUO0xvnMGbd8ITCojzxg' alt='Syrians wave the country’s new flag while awaiting a military parade in central Damascus on the first anniversary of Assad’s fall.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Public celebrations: Official events in Damascus center on Umayyad Square, where crowds waving Syria’s new flag await military and civilian parades to mark the first anniversary of Assad’s overthrow.</li><li>Cultural reopening: Theatres, festivals and cafes that once operated in fear or secrecy are reopening and drawing larger audiences, as artists stage work that would previously have been censored or banned.</li><li>Media freedoms: Journalists describe a shift from heavy surveillance and midnight raids to being able to report in the streets, interview residents openly and publish full stories without prior censorship.</li><li>Return of diaspora: Members of the 6.7 million‑strong Syrian diaspora are visiting or resettling after more than a decade away, saying they no longer fear the regime’s reach when reconnecting with family and homeland.</li><li>Political and security strains: Analysts note that fragmented armed groups, sporadic violence and uneven authority across regions threaten efforts to build unified state institutions and keep communities safe.</li></ul><blockquote>Journalism has returned to a truly professional practice, where telling stories as they are, is now a duty and not a risk. - Omar Mustafa, Aleppo-based journalist</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ahmed al‑Sharaa’s interim government: The new leadership frames Liberation Day as the beginning of a “just and strong Syria,” emphasizing national reconstruction from “north to south and from east to west.”.
