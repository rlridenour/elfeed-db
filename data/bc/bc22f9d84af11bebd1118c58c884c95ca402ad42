That could soon change.<br/>

<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-13/apple-vision-pro-2-details-low-latency-headset-ar-glasses-ipados-19-details-m9flf1fd"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today said</a> that iPadOS 19 will be "more like macOS."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said that iPadOS 19 will be "more like a Mac" in three ways:<ul><li>Improved productivity</li><br/>
<li>Improved multitasking</li><br/>
<li>Improved app window management</li></ul> "I'm told that this year's upgrade will focus on productivity, multitasking and app window management — with an eye on the device operating more like a Mac," said Gurman, in the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-13/apple-vision-pro-2-details-low-latency-headset-ar-glasses-ipados-19-details-m9flf1fd"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>. "It's been a long time coming, with iPad power users pleading with Apple to make the tablet more powerful."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman did not provide any specific details.<br/>
