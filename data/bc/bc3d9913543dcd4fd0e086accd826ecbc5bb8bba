<p>
Two native-code compilers written in the <a href="http://www.ulisp.com/show?3J">uLisp</a> dialect that targets
microcontroller-class machines. Both use a combination of stack
and register allocation to get efficiency – and they're <i>very</i>
efficient, with the compiled versions sometimes being 100x faster
than the interpreted code.

<p>
These are not complete ports, and indeed not on a complete or
standard underlying Lisp implementation. But it's still fascinating
to see how <i>simple</i> it is, built as a recursive-descent tree-walker
that emits assembler directly. With careful initial design even a
compiler with no optimisation pathways can still get great speed-up
over an interpreter.
