<p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered Colombia&#x27;s public forces to stop sharing intelligence with the U.S. Intelligence Community until the United States ends military strikes on small vessels in the Caribbean, citing concern for the rights of Caribbean people. Petro&#x27;s move follows a wave of U.S. operations targeting suspected drug-smuggling boats that the Pentagon says have killed dozens since August, a development that has sharply raised diplomatic tensions between Bogotá and Washington. The suspension could complicate joint counternarcotics work and comes amid heightened regional naval activity and public back-and-forth between the two presidents.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/KInvAb9qbKrJwQeMozTcO10JPSTHJL7szq3tIZs-Iev15UoZkQaDIwwKRSlBfAEsV30TiuLa2qpOnaQHKMEWrpFNRc3y3nETzLRWSnOfdU8tru9yAs9WcimeoaVPzGQc_A3ph015oednAPoMHgeJO9zX5WG_-EkBbOXGKYjO0KFzbrvS8HNTt3UeUsd-TCO78dwHImjOkxkLYUU5YVhDer0khJdYsFj06rf2LByHeKuinzFDHm12sKh_aGWRiBHRsyY' alt='Colombian President Gustavo Petro at a recent regional event (archive image)' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Pentagon rationale: The U.S. Pentagon says the strikes target drug-smuggling vessels allegedly operating out of Venezuela and Colombia, framing them as part of counternarcotics operations.</li><li>Scope of operations: Since early September, U.S. forces have carried out strikes on roughly 20 small vessels in the Caribbean as part of the campaign against suspected smugglers.</li><li>Sanctions backdrop: Tensions predate the announcement: U.S. authorities have imposed sanctions on President Petro, members of his family and some cabinet ministers, a factor Petro has cited in condemning U.S. actions.</li><li>Regional military posture: A U.S. aircraft carrier recently arrived in the Caribbean, a development regional analysts see as increasing naval activity near the strikes&#x27; area.</li></ul><blockquote>The fight against drugs must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people - Gustavo Petro</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Gustavo Petro / Colombian government: Petro ordered public forces to halt communications with U.S. security agencies until the strikes stop, saying the response defends the human rights of Caribbean communities.
