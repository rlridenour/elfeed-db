<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 3 licenses ($49.95 value each) for <a href="https://inbox-ai.app/">Inbox AI</a>. Inbox AI lets you have conversations with AI, automate tasks, process your emails, and capture information - all through voice and connected to your information. This one is a popular user request, and I&rsquo;m glad I could bring it to you!</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inbox AI is a productivity &amp; automation app. Build custom voice commands and ai-based email processing rules. Create workflows like extracting tasks from emails, screenshots, and audio, or use workflows others have created. Simply select anything on your screen, or say it out loud to integrate with any of your favorite applications like Reminders, Notion, Tana, and Obsidian using API or terminal commands.</p>
