<p>The practice of cartomancy, or divination with cards, <a href="https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/the-surprising-origins-of-tarot-most-misunderstood-cards/">dates back several hundred years</a> to at least 14th century Europe, perhaps by way of Turkey. But the specific form we know of, the tarot, likely emerged in the 17th century, and the deck we’re all most familiar with—<a href="https://www.openculture.com/2021/03/meet-the-forgotten-female-artist-behind-the-worlds-most-popular-tarot-deck-1909.html">the Rider-Waite Tarot</a>—didn’t appear until 1909. Popular mainly with occultists like Aleister Crowley and Madame Blavatsky in the early 20th century, the tarot exploded into popular culture in the new age 70s with books like Stuart Kaplan’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2dFvXMK">Tarot Cards for Fun and Fortune Telling</a></em>, and by way of cult filmmakers like Alejandro Jodorowsky.</p>
<p>Since its relatively recent popularization, “fun” and “fortune telling” have more or less defined most people’s attitude to the tarot, whether they approve or disapprove of either one. But for artists and poets like William Butler Yeats, T.S. Eliot, and surrealist director Jodorowsky—whose film narration is perhaps the most poetic in modern cinema—the tarot has always meant something much more mysterious and inspiring. “The tarot,” says Jodorowsky in the short film above, “will teach you how to create a soul.”</p>

<p>After studying the Major and Minor Arcana and the suits, and puzzling over the symbols on each card, Jodorowsky discovered that “all 78 cards could be joined in a <em>mandala</em>, in just one image.” Learning to see the deck thus, “You must not talk about the future. The future is a con. The tarot is a language that talks about the present. If you use it to see the future, you become a conman.” Like other mystical poets, Jodorowsky’s study of the tarot did not lead him to the supernatural but to the creative act.</p>

<p>And like many a poet before him, Jodorowsky explored the journey of the Fool in his 1973 film <em>The Holy Mountain</em>, a “dazzling, rambling, often incoherent satire,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/18/movies/18moun.html">writes Matt Zoller Seitz</a>, that “unfurls like a hallucinogenic daydream.” Jodorowsky’s cinematic dream logic comes not only from his work as a “<a href="https://amzn.to/4o3drhD">shamanic psychotherapist</a>.” He also credits the tarot for his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/the-psychomagical-realism-of-alejandro-jodorowsky.html">psychomagical realism</a>. “For me,” says Jodorowsky in the video at the top, “the tarot was something more serious. It was a deep psychological search.” The result of that search—Jodorowsky’s singular and totally unforgettable body of work—speaks to us of the value of such an undertaking, whatever means one uses to get there.</p>
<p>Or as Jodorowsky says in one of his mystical pronouncements, “If you set your spirit to something, that phenomenon will happen.” If that sounds like magical thinking, that’s exactly what it is. Jodorowsky shows us how to read the tarot as he does, for psychological insight and creative inspiration, in the video above, addressed to a fan named John Bishop. Spanish speakers will have no trouble understanding his presentation, as he quickly slides almost fully into his native language through lack of confidence in his facility with English. The video belongs to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX93hv72qDkiEzaMVc8nS0w">a series on Jodorowsky’s YouTube channel</a>, most of them fully in Spanish without subtitles.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for English speakers, the subtitled video at the top offers a surprisingly dense lesson on the Chilean mystic’s interpretation of the tarot’s supposed wisdom as a symbolic system, and a way of telling the present.</p>
<p>Should you wish to know more, you can find it in Jodorowsky’s book&nbsp;<em><a href="http://amzn.to/2d4fnXv">T</a><a href="https://amzn.to/2d4fnXv">he Way of Tarot: The Spiritual&nbsp;Teacher in the Cards</a></em>, and practice on your very own deck of <a href="https://amzn.to/3We8jeh">Jodorowsky-designed tarot cards</a>.</p>
