<p>From <a href="https://sachachua.com">Sacha</a> I learned about <a href="https://johnrakestraw.com/post/on-keeping-a-notebook/">On keeping a notebook</a> by John Rakestraw.  And John’s
reflection shone as morning sun on the calm lake outside my waking window.</p>
<p>I am thankful for the time I spent writing down 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2021/02/26/a-journey-to-conjure-those-now-gone/">A Journey to Conjure Those Now Gone</a></cite>; capturing the prior evenings waking and dreaming.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read that post several times, and even thinking of it now, I feel the sting
of welcome tears gathering in my eyes; reminders of humanity, of what I&rsquo;ve lived
and lost.  Intrinsically a part of who I am, as I drift along the river of life.</p>
<p>Who are we when we lose part of us?  Do we become more or less than what we
were?</p>
<p>I’m also thankful that I wrote down a 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2021/02/06/winters-reverie/">Winter&#39;s Reverie</a></cite>; an evening of simple
adventure in my back yard with our two dogs and me.  Again I tear up at the
thoughts of Corrie, who at that time was quietly experiencing the beginning
ravages of liver cancer that would one day force upon us the decision to
euthanize her.</p>
<p>And I tear up at the thought of Ollie, now older and arthritic, knowing that all
too soon, time will separate us.  Who will go first?  Him or I?</p>

Death, no matter our desires, can’t be distracted.  We know this much is true,
and it’s true for all souls: each of us will one day find the feast finished
and, fattened or famished, step slowly backward into their own dark hall for
that final night of sleep.

<p>We moved recently, and I was trying to remember if I owned <cite data-id="4e959922-6b23-491e-96e8-36dca782aa48">Novelist as Vocation</cite> by Haruki Murakami; in part because
Murakami (and Kafka) kept coming up in my travels through my literary and
digital neighborhoods.</p>
<p>I had memories of holding the <cite data-id="4e959922-6b23-491e-96e8-36dca782aa48">Novelist as Vocation</cite> and of other books along
side it.  But I couldn’t recall if I had set it down or not.  I poured through
my daily journals, finding reference to <cite data-id="50692E9D-0DC3-4D57-92E6-395DAA08D615"><a href="https://commongood.cc/reader/a-few-rules-for-predicting-the-future-by-octavia-e-butler/">A Few Rules for Predicting the Future</a></cite> by Octavia Butler; one I had purchased and read at a restaurant later that day.</p>
<p>This sparked a memory of another book for which I knew I bought but for which I
could not account: <cite data-id="0EEB1AF1-65B3-477B-AB67-96BFED263AD0">Kant&rsquo;s Little Prussian Head and Other Reasons Why I Write</cite> by Claire Messud.  While at a library I had read a few essays from that book,
and promised myself to purchase the book were I ever to find it; essays on Camus
and a pithy title about Kant?  Yes please.</p>
<p>With knowledge that I had likely purchased the book, I replayed in my head what
I might have done.  Those memories were blocked, but the instincts were there:
put them in the basement, out of the way, for that day when I reshelf my boxed
books.</p>
<p>I rummaged a bit, and found an unassuming plastic bag; one I had dismissed as
home to yet to be tidied construction supplies.  I grabbed the bag, and found
another trove of books, the ones I half remembered gathering.</p>
<p>What in life is worth remembering?  Is there a hope that if we do, we can
achieve some immortality?</p>

As a writer, you withdraw and disconnect yourself from the world in order to
connect to it in the far-reaching way that is other people elsewhere reading the
words that came together in a contemplative state.

<p>I know as someone who feels the compulsion to write, channeling the “patron
saint” Montaigne, that I also feel a compulsion to explore the how and why of
what I write.  Hence adding <cite data-id="4968c62c-d89a-415f-95e9-1c1ce9b96858">The Notebook</cite> by Roland Allen to my shopping list.</p>
<p>It is also a primary driver for my incessant tinkering with <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
; to help my
tools keep pace with my thoughts but also to build means of revisiting those
thoughts; and those of others of whom I’ve read and lived a bit through their
eyes.</p>
<p>I do most of my writing on a computer; accepting that with all the conveniences
comes a loss.  Losing that relative slowness of ink to paper, a slowness in
which thoughts move and grow as though under a different light.  And losing the
immediacy, that is what I write on my computer requires a computer and all its
wizardry to read; whereas those paper notebooks require the paper notebook.</p>
<p>Writing is a release, as though my mind were a dammed reservoir, with rain and
snow-melt filling it up.  I feel the levies strain; and writing is my opening
the dam and letting flow forth the life waters.  For I cannot hold them back,
a follow that will spill forth ruinous flood.</p>
<p>And what of tears?  Do those fall into the reservoir?  Or are they sputtering
from a cracking dam?</p>

<p>And <time datetime="2025-03-25" title="2025-03-25">today</time>, through Sacha’s mastodon post, I learned of a new constellation of
others who feel and express these compulsions.</p>
<p>This all dovetails with an email I received from <a href="https://traceydurnell.com">Tracy</a> asking further questions
of 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/03/23/a-walk-through-my-digital-neighborhood/">A Walk Through My Digital Neighborhood</a></cite>; there’s a blog post in that response.
But for now, I’ll summarize that it gets into a bit more of how I live in my
neighborhoods as well as express “digital community.”  And reflections there-in.</p>
<p>I also wonder how this compulsion dovetails with <time datetime="2025-03-24" title="2025-03-24">yesterday’s</time> reading of <cite data-id="5dd8020b-640b-420d-ae24-84169585038c">To Fight Against this Age</cite> by Rob Riemen which quoted the
following:</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="one-of-the-most-striking-characteristics-of-the-contemporary-world">
<p>
One of the most striking characteristics of the contemporary world is its
<i class="dfn">superficiality</i>: we vacillate between superficiality and restlessness.
</p>
<footer>&#8213; Paul Valéry</footer></blockquote>
<p>I certainly feel the restlessness of which Valéry wrote; and wonder if these
compulsions are my soul fighting against the pull of the superficiality of our
contemporary world.  As though my soul senses the event horizon that is the
(growing) singularity of our contemporary world.  Pulling and stretching with
one goal: consumption.</p>
<p>As I’ve expanded the scope my blog and written more (both public and private), I
feel as though I’ve introduced(/discovered/honed?) a lyricism and poetic to my
voice.  In part as a playfulness, but also in an effort to draw connections.</p>
<p>Recalling my freshman year of college, during a general education requirement
class in Philosophy, Professor Brandt mentioned in a paper that I had “the soul
of a philosopher.”</p>
<p>I wanted to respond: “Which one?” With the implication that I had captured a
soul and had it in some vessel.</p>
<p>But I knew what Professor Brandt meant; I was uninterested in the
superficiality of things.  Instead feeling alive in moments engaging in
<dfn>culture</dfn>: that process of cultivating the soul, for being open to
truth, beauty, and doing what’s right.</p>
<p>How shall I fight against that which is proclaimed inevitable?</p>

<p>In 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2014/12/14/divorce-a-personal-experience/">Divorce - A Personal Experience</a></cite>, I wrote of shoe boxes of photos I had taken
of my future self.  Divorce, in part, being about casting into the fire those
future memories.</p>
<p>There are also those shoe boxes of photos of past lives lived.  They reflect
constructed moments, important stories I continue to tell myself.  But unless I
pull those boxes down, and sift through them, I might become transfixed in
nostalgia; a precarious glorification of untruth.</p>
<p>The allure of nostalgia: a reconstructing of a past that never was <em>and</em>
wishing for a return.  It is a simplification and a negation of past struggles.
I find writing in a notebook to be part of the hygiene of avoiding the nostalgia
trap; they are the soap of which I can use to scrub clean and reveal those
memories.</p>
<p>Why else would folks destroy history?  To reconstruct a different corpus of
memories.  To project a simplification onto the past, which invariably is an
untruth.</p>
<blockquote class="verse epigraph" data-id="i-love-the-dark-hours-of-my-being">
I love the dark hours of my being.<br />
My mind deepens into them.<br />
There I can find, as in old letters,<br />
the days of my life, already lived,<br />
and held like a legend, and understood.<br />
<br />
Then the knowing comes: I can open<br />
to another life that’s wide and timeless.<br />
<br />
So I am sometimes like a tree<br />
rustling over a gravesite<br />
and making real the dream<br />
of the one its living roots<br />
embrace:<br />
<br />
a dream once lost<br />
among sorrows and songs.<br />

<p>In re-reading old journals I exhume a past that I may have buried.  But digging
in that dirt also brings my present self into that earthen grave.  In a
communion of then and now.</p>
<p>I lay down amongst myself as I-from-above, toss earth once more upon the
plurality of me; leaving my journals as the headstone by which the future
multiples of me may find that treasured “X” and dig again.</p>
<p>I opened with the first sentence of Anaïs Nin’s entry, but thanks to John
Rakestraw’s investigation in <a href="https://johnrakestraw.com/post/we-write-to-taste-life-twice/">We write to taste life twice</a>, there is so much
more.</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="expanded-we-write-to-taste-life-twice-in-the-moment-and-in-retrospection">
<p>
We write to taste life twice, in the moment, and in retrospection.  We write,
like Proust, to render all of it eternal, and to persuade ourselves that it is
eternal.  We write to be able to transcend our life, to reach beyond it.  We
write to teach ourselves to speak with others, to record the journey into the
labyrinth.  We write to expand our world when we feel strangled, or constricted,
or lonely.  We write as the birds sing, as the primitives dance their rituals.
If you do not breathe through writing, if you do not cry out in writing, or sing
in writing, then don’t write, because our culture has no use for it.  When I
don’t write, I feel my world shrinking.  I feel I am in a prison.  I feel I lose
my fire and my color.  It should be a necessity, as the sea needs to heave, and
I call it breathing.
