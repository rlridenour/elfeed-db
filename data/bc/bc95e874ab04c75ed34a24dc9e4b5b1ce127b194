Recent reports have suggested Apple is actively considering bringing cellular connectivity to the Mac lineup as early as next year, but arch rival Microsoft isn't waiting around to find out – the company is launching its first 5G-enabled Surface laptop this month.<br/>

The Surface Laptop 5G is part of Microsoft's Copilot+ PC lineup aimed at business customers, featuring a 13.8-inch display and Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) processors. Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2025/07/22/introducing-surface-laptop-5g-seamless-connectivity-built-for-business">says</a> it has six "strategically placed antennas" that allow it to automatically adjust signal paths and power based on usage. The device includes both Nano SIM and eSIM options, and can also function as a hotspot for other devices. <br/>
<br/>
Starting at &#36;1,700, Microsoft says it will begin shipping its first 5G-enabled Surface laptop on August 26 with support for over 100 carriers worldwide – though its small print notes that 5G will be available "later in 2025."<br/>
<br/>
The Surface Laptop's 5G capabilities come as Apple has begun deploying its custom-built C1 modem chip in some devices. The company introduced a sub-6GHz version of its 5G modem in the iPhone 16e earlier this year and is expected to include it in the upcoming iPhone 17 "Air," which will be unveiled next month.<br/>
<br/>
According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apple-cellular-mac-custom-modem/">December</a> report by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, Apple is "investigating" the possibility of adding a second-generation C2 modem to a future Mac as early as 2026. According to Gurman, Apple's next-generation C2 modem will support faster mmWave technology and is expected to arrive in 2026, debuting in Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models – with inclusion in a Mac potentially shortly after. <br/>

Apple has played with the idea of a cellular MacBook for years now. Back in 2007, the company developed MacBook Pro prototypes with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2011/08/14/photos-of-a-prototype-macbook-pro-with-integrated-3g-cellular-data/">integrated 3G connectivity</a>, including a SIM card slot and an extendable cellular antenna along the right side of the lid. Despite these early experiments, Apple never released a MacBook with built-in cellular capabilities. Here's hoping 2026 will be the year it happens.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/c1/">C1</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft-surface/">Microsoft Surface</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/apple-cellular-macbook-microsoft-5g-surface/">Apple Still Investigating Cellular MacBook as Microsoft Ships Surface 5G</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-investigating-cellular-macbook-as-microsoft-ships-surface-5g.2462860/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
