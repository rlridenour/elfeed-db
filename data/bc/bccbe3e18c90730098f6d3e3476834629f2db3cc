<p>Israeli airstrikes, tank shelling, and drone strikes hit multiple areas across the Gaza Strip, killing at least 21–24 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials and hospital staff. Israel said Palestinian militants attacked its soldiers, seriously or critically wounding at least one serviceman. It also said some strikes targeted people it described as posing a threat to its forces. The latest violence has further strained a ceasefire that has been described as fragile since it took effect in October; multiple outlets reported that Gaza residents and officials are questioning whether the truce is holding in practice. The Rafah crossing to Egypt had recently reopened, but the Guardian reported that patient evacuations were halted again amid the escalation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/inSRKrR6L9wuJ7R-zq0SEvfoSJn8-GibdMR92xXdrUWJxL3JmygbZM8mtbk3plAlGzIpeFvtC89oUHQ35SoTY5XfmF2L1J8-WmfkJ4fV_gXlzoBZh6Vv0_Ce5DV_d1iT04fHpuNPG0wnr5zy2N_Q45GeeL19M0PzBL0CsfA3uBJ3oWBfvFX6C7bZNSOxqOcPudUIk31Qx-bGZwdg9cOeROafcwfGX4y-B2Bjpv7rQaV1uyOUcLU75wPnp0M0AbXfBNG94ATMZzMvGUA0ap_-Tu7dYaAMf3cr2dGpoHciwsWYaOvF5pxQ16pOWDTaivQDJpTf4CpkqQ5gx_d7m3Kvy5M8jiY6jg59rSB5d9_ImTz3Lvr9hITbKEn1YkhlyfIAbyoDRDTgPROzhB918wxuxSKpgEB-Vr7Cr7ZXDi2v__0' alt='Aftermath imagery from reporting on Israeli strikes in Gaza.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Child casualties: Health officials said children were among those killed, though the reported number varies across accounts: three children, seven children, and five children.</li><li>Women, medic, second strike: Reports said women were among the dead.
