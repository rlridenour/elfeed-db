In response to my post <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13036">macOS Keybindings In Emacs</a>, Paul R. Jorgensen notes that <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13036#comment-6717364252">not every macOS Emacs port has the OS bindings defined</a>. In particular, those ports based on the Mac&rsquo;s Cocoa interface don&rsquo;t support them.
</p>
<p>
Jorgensen has <a href="https://plrj.org/2025/06/04/my-emacs-mac-macos-keybindings/">his own post</a> on the matter that goes into a bit more detail. As far as I can tell, unless your using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/src/master/">Mitsuharu Yamamoto&rsquo;s Emacs port for the mac</a> this isn&rsquo;t a problem but if you&rsquo;re not  using a NextStep based port, you&rsquo;re probably going to have a problem using macOS keybindings in Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Not to worry though. If you want those keybindings and your port doesn&rsquo;t provide them, Jorgensen shows you how to get them. His setup assumes the <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd> key is mapped to <kbd>Super</kbd> so that, for instance, <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> is mapped to <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd>. If you have <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd> mapped to something else, it may not work as well. For example, if you map <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd> to <kbd>Meta</kbd> the way many people do, then <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> is going to get you a scroll up rather than a paste.

As I said in my original post, I don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s a lot a value in having these bindings added to Emacs—but see <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13036#comment-6717771378">hmelman&rsquo;s comment for an contrary viewpoint</a>—so I wouldn&rsquo;t bother changing my mappings if you&rsquo;re a <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd> == <kbd>Meta</kbd> user. Regardless, as <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13036#comment-6717878915">Jorgensen says</a>, &ldquo;Emacs is a wonderfully flexible tool, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
