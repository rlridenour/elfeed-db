<p>The Economist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Presidents’ popularity tends to wane. In his second term Donald
Trump’s has fallen faster than that of his recent predecessors.</p>

<p>Since modern polling began most presidents have started their
terms with positive net approval ratings (the share of voters who
approve of their job performance minus the share who disapprove).
Both of Mr Trump’s terms began with public opinion split nearly
evenly. In both cases his net approval rating quickly turned
negative. Now it is -18, the lowest it has been since his
inauguration — and three percentage-points lower than at any
point in his first term.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>State-by-state, Trump is only above water in nine states: Idaho, Wyoming, West Virginia, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-popularity-dips-americans-sweat-cost-living-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2025-10-28/">Reuters, with its own poll</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donald Trump’s presidential approval rating fell in recent days,
tying the lowest level of his term, as more Americans frowned on
his handling of the cost of living, according to a new
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/data/trumps-approval-rating-2025-01-21/">Reuters/Ipsos poll</a>.</p>

<p>The three-day poll, which concluded on Sunday, showed 40% of
Americans approve of the Republican leader’s job performance,
compared to 42% in an October 15-20 Reuters/Ipsos poll. Trump’s
popularity has been within a percentage point or two of its
current level in every Reuters/Ipsos poll since mid-May. The share
of people who say they disapprove of his performance has grown,
from 52% in a May 16-18 poll to 57% in the latest survey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the Economist has him at -18, Reuters at -17.</p>
