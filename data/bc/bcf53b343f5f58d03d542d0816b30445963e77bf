We started our journey by flying into Seattle, renting a campervan, and driving up to the North Cascades.

<p>
We spent our first night at North Colonial Creek Campground, which is a beautiful camp on the water. In the morning we hiked the Thunder Knobb Trail, which left directly from our campsite. The hike took around 1.5 hours. First, we climbed up to an outlook of a snowy tipped mountain.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgaee6c17">
<p>
We hiked the Blue Lakes Trail in mid-June. The trail was beautiful, but it was still quite snow covered. If you don't have snow gear, I would recommend holding off on this trail until July or August. This trail is a steady climb to a beautiful blue lake with reflected views of the mountains. However, right before we reached the final viewpoint of the trail, we saw a mountain goat on the trail. He started to follow us, so we turned back before reaching the final viewpoint to avoid any potential issues with the mountain goat. We learned from other hikers on our return that this mountain goat is friendly and frequents the trail often because people have been feeding him. We quite enjoyed this trail and the opportunity to see a mountain goat. We would love to return to this trail in July or August for a less snowy hike and for a chance to make it to the final viewpoint.

<p>
Winthrop is a super cute old fashioned style town just outside of the North Cascades. We stopped here to walk around, check out the outdoors store, stop in the candy store, and grab a bite to eat. We had lunch at Oliver's Artisan Kitchen, which had great sandwiches, crepes, and hot chocolate (which was especially needed after our snowy hike on the Blue Lake Trail).

Olympic National Park is a very large and diverse national park. We used the GuideAlong app to help navigate our time in Olympic. We started our trip at Lake Quinault where we did a short rainforest nature walk and then drove a scenic loop around Lake Quinault. Our rainforest walk was called the Rainforest Nature Trail, and we would say it's definitely worth a stop. The scenic drive around the Lake was nice, and we did pop out for a scenic waterfall stop. However, the road around the lake had a lot of potholes, which was a bit hard on our campervan, so we do not plan to return to this drive.

After Lake Quinault, we drove toward the shore and made a stop at Kalaloch Beach to see the Tree of Life. The Tree of Life had all the soil beneath it blown out by a big storm, so it appears to be suspended in mid-air. We thought this was a fun stop to make.

Next, we started along the Hoh River Trail. This trail is 17.3 miles long and is intended for a short backpacking trip to Glacier Meadows. The trail was very muddy, so make sure to bring waterproof shoes if you make this journey. We hiked just a bit into the trail, but we would love to come back and do this one as a backpacking trip.

Coho Campground is located in Olympic National Forest and was booked through Recreation.gov. It was a very scenic campground where you could walk to the water and were surrounded by mossy trees. Olympic National Park was a great time where we saw rainforests, beaches, and alpine views. The park is very large and the drive between stops was not as scenic. We appreciated how many different sites we were able to see while at Olympic, but if we come back to Olympic in the future, we would probably concentrate our time in a specific area of the park to reduce driving time. We especially would like to spend more time in Hurricane Ridge. We did not get a chance to visit the Sol Duc Valley, Elwha Valley, or the Dungeness Spit, so we may also add those in as stops on a future trip.

Portland is famous for its donuts, and we stopped at two spots to see if the donuts lived up to the hype. First, we stopped at Pip's Donuts and Chai. Pip's had many flavors of mini donuts; we especially liked their seasonal strawberry rhubarb mini donut. We also tried the chocolate chai, which was filled with sweet chai and chocolate flavors. Next, we headed to Blue Star Donuts, which is known for making delicious brioche donuts in unique flavors. We tried the Old-Fashioned Buttermilk, the O.G., and the Chocolate Bergamon Old-Fashioned. We thought that all the flavors were great! My favorite was the Chocolate Bergamon Old-Fashioned, and Alec's favorite was the Old-Fashioned Buttermilk.

<h3 id="org5513cb8">The Fruit Loop</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5513cb8">
<p>
On the way to the Fruit Loop, we saw signs for Multnomah falls. They were sold out of passes for the day we were driving through, but we would like to add this as a stop another time. The Fruit Loop is a loop of 32 fruit stands, wineries, cideries, and farms situated between beautiful mountains. First, we stopped at Pearl's Place Fruit Stand where we bought some Mount Rainier cherries and apples. We especially loved the cherries! We also stopped at the White House where we enjoyed a White House Burger for lunch, and we did U-pick for blueberries and raspberries. We also stopped at Fox Tail Cider and Distillery where Alec got a flight of ciders to try. Then, we continued on to Packer Orchards, which had a beautiful outdoor seating area with a view. Packer Orchards also had a big table with tons of samples of their jams, sauces, honeys, and canned vegetables. Then, we walked through the store to see their baked goods and other treats. We bought a bottle of their non-alcoholic Pear Cider, and it was amazing. Our last stop on the Fruit Loop was Draper Girls Country Farm where we bought some peaches. Then, we admired the stunning view and cute swing in their outdoor seating area.

If we come back to Crater Lake, we would like to come in July or August when more of the park is open, and we would like to hike down to the lake.

The Shasta Caverns were just 6 minutes down the road from Bailey Cove Campgrounds. We took a boat across Lake Shasta, and then, we took a scenic bus ride to the caverns. The tour of the caverns was very impressive. We learned a lot about different cave formations and the history of the Shasta Cave.
