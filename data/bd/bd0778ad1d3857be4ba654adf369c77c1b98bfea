<p>Six Colors reader Len Dintzer wrote in with an Apple Watch daily tracking question—and then the answer!</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Here’s my problem: I have a Move Streak message saying I interrupted my streak and a Move Activity record that shows that I did not miss a day.…
</p></blockquote>
<p>He included two screenshots:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The first is from my Apple Watch, which says my Move Streak ended on 4/29/25, but that I have a current store of 32 days. Problem 1: Today is May 20, and it hasn’t been 32 days since April 29. Problem 2: I haven’t missed any days.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s no reason for this to happen and I couldn’t find an answer in my device research or online. Fortunately, Len consulted a higher authority and received an accurate set of directions to fix, which I’m sharing here with some additional detail for how to carry out each task. Thanks, Len!</p>

<h2>Reset a broken work streak</h2>
<p>Apple told Len to follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform an iCloud backup on the iPhone.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; <em>Account Name</em> &gt; iCloud.</li>
<li>Tap iCloud Backup.</li>
<li>Tap Backup Now and wait for it to complete.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Turn off Health Data on the iPhone.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; <em>Account Name</em> &gt; See All &gt; Health.</li>
<li>Turn off “Sync this iPhone.”</li>
<li>Tap Turn Off.</li>
<li>When prompted with “Keep or Delete Health Data?”, tap Keep on My iPhone. This is vital!</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Power down your iPhone and your Apple Watch.
</li>
<li>
<p>Start up your iPhone and your Apple Watch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple apparently omitted the final step, but make sure to return to Settings &gt; <em>Account Name</em> &gt; See All &gt; Health on your iPhone and turn “Sync this iPhone” back on.</p>
<p>Len said this resolved the streak problem just as promised.</p>
