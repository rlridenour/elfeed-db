<p>Our Ghost &#8211; DeadSwitch sent us a field-note on Social Engineering. The Signal is below:</p>



<p>An innocent email.<br>A casual phone call.<br>They warn of a password change.<br>They demand an account review.</p>



<p>You open a form.<br>Your data bleeds.</p>



<span id="more-8116"></span>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Hack Of The Mind</h3>



<p>Dark Ghosts hunt your data.<br>Not in the system. In your brain.<br>Hackers breach systems. Social Engineers breach you.</p>



<p>They go for access.<br>They want data.</p>



<p>Familiar voice. Corporate style and web surface.<br>They suppress the alert in your mind.</p>



<p>They demand action.<br>You must log in somewhere. Spell out a password.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Creating urgency is the Dark Ghost&#8217;s best weapon.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Signs Of The Dark Ghosts</h3>



<p>They inflate the urgency. Immediate pressure.<br>They &#8220;warn&#8221; you of losing your account if you don&#8217;t log in.<br>Or to pay extra fees if you don&#8217;t act on the spot.<br>Urgency is a clear sign of Social Engineering.</p>



<p>There are minor design differences from the original sites.<br>Some typos. A few mistakes.<br>Look for strange URLs.<br>Misspelled domain names.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Anomalies are there…<br>you have to notice them.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Protect Your Kingdom</h3>



<p>Look for the signs of the Dark Ghosts.<br>Never click unknown or strange-looking links.<br>Shortened links can hide step-mines.<br>Double-check the URLs. Always.<br>Never share information on the phone.<br>Enter credentials only in trusted, TLS-encrypted forms.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Train yourself to spot the anomalies…<br>or the Dark Ghosts will teach you to do it.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Final Whispers</h3>



<p>They try to hack your mind.<br>Protect your perimeters.<br>Secure your core.</p>



<p>Social Engineering hunts you. The Dark Ghosts do too.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Ghostware runs not in silicon, but in your thoughts.</p>
