The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is no longer targeting Apple for a 2021 email that Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> sent to employees, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-26/us-labor-board-withdraws-claims-that-apple-ceo-violated-workers-rights">Bloomberg</a></em>. The NLRB said that it is withdrawing most of the claims in a complaint that accused Cook <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/30/apple-labor-law-violation-leak-email/">of violating U.S. labor law</a> by warning employees about leaking confidential information.<br/>

Cook sent the email in 2021, stating that Apple was working to identify people who had leaked information, and that such people do not belong at Apple. Cook's email followed a leaked Apple meeting that included topics like pay equity and working from home.<br/>
<br/>
The NLRB said that Apple's rules around leaks "tend to interfere with, restrain or coerce employees" from the exercise of their rights under the National Labor Relations Act.<br/>

Claims that Apple broke the law by imposing confidentiality rules and surveilling workers are being withdrawn.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nlrb/">NLRB</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/26/nlrb-leak-email-case-dropped/">NLRB Withdraws Claims That Tim Cook&#039;s Anti-Leak Email Violated Labor Laws</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nlrb-withdraws-claims-that-tim-cooks-anti-leak-email-violated-labor-laws.2467656/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
