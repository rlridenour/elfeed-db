<p>Brenton Tarrant, the Australian white supremacist convicted of murdering 51 Muslim worshippers in attacks on two Christchurch mosques in 2019, has asked New Zealand’s Court of Appeal to set aside his guilty pleas and appeal his convictions and sentence. He is serving life in prison without parole — a first under New Zealand’s current laws. In court filings and reporting from the hearing, Tarrant argues that harsh, isolating detention conditions before and during the trial damaged his mental health and left him unable to make rational, informed decisions when he admitted the charges. Coverage also notes that Tarrant published a manifesto beforehand and livestreamed the attack.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JF6iZovybDsIa8KaT822gCa3d12f6Kka-xbGGXpu8KhyONP1vBnQo59JkGE7NFpPwM849sKycxiIDl4tQ1s7oaaxC9XbPtqgp-osuH9RFEwk' alt='Police cordon off the area in front of the Masjid al Noor mosque after the March 15, 2019, Christchurch attack.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Charges pleaded: Tarrant pleaded guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 counts of attempted murder, and a terrorism charge, after first signalling he would fight the case.</li><li>Hearing limits: Reporting on the appeal says the court has imposed tight limits on who can attend.</li><li>Attack method: Reports say he used semi-automatic weapons in the assaults on the two mosques.</li><li>Background detail: Coverage describes Tarrant as an Australian former gym instructor.</li><li>Notable claim: In reporting from the hearing, Tarrant said that as his mental state deteriorated, he considered making false claims — including trying to implicate President Donald Trump.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Brenton Tarrant (appellant): He says “torturous and inhumane” prison conditions left him irrational and unable to make informed decisions when he pleaded guilty.
