On its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/visionos/resources/">visionOS resources page</a> for developers, Apple says the Developer Strap will be available to order again starting Wednesday, October 22, which is the same day that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">Vision Pro with the M5 chip</a> will be released. Accordingly, it seems likely that Apple plans to release an updated version of the accessory next week.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-selling-vision-pro-developer-strap/">first released the Developer Strap</a> in February 2024, when the original Vision Pro with the M2 chip launched in the United States. The optional accessory provides a USB-C connection between the Vision Pro and a Mac, for app development and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-developer-strap-diagnostics-mode/">diagnostic purposes</a>. It can only be purchased by Apple Developer Program members.<br/>

It is unclear what new features or changes the updated Developer Strap would have, or if it will remain priced at &#36;299 in the United States. It also remains to be seen if the new version of the accessory is compatible with the original Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1o9z0ay/vision_pro_new_developer_strap/">noted on Reddit</a>, the current Developer Strap is limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480 Mbps, even though it <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/13/the-apple-vision-pro-thunderbolt-developer-strap-usb-2-0-external-drives-displayport-monitors/">technically could support Thunderbolt</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/18/apple-may-update-vision-pro-developer-strap/">Apple&#039;s Vision Pro Developer Strap May Receive an Upgrade Next Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-vision-pro-developer-strap-may-receive-an-upgrade-next-week.2469364/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
