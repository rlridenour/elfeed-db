<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96826/2025/1124701-warfare-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg"/></p> <p>I decided to watch this on a whim today, and I'm glad I did. This is a difficult movie to watch, not just because of the subject matter but also because there's no real plot or story. I think that's part of the point.</p><p>This is an authentic story (as much as I can gather) of one of many instances - and just that, one moment (well, a 90-minute-long moment) of the war in Iraq, with all its horrors. It was created as a memory, like a journal note, of how things were back then for the people who were there; it's not the kind of movie you watch in a theater, eating popcorn.</p><p>What I appreciate about this movie is that it doesn't attempt to draw politics in. There's also no attempt at heroism or really any symbolism. It's a simple movie that makes a simple delivery.</p>
