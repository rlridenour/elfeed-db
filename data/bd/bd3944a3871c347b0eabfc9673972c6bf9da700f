Apple CEO Tim Cook is "hell bent" on bringing true augmented reality glasses to market before Meta can achieve the same feat, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>

Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-13/apple-vision-pro-2-details-low-latency-headset-ar-glasses-ipados-19-details-m9flf1fd">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman says that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/vision-pro-2-two-rumored-upgrades/">upcoming new versions</a> of Apple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset are a "stepping stone" towards Cook's ultimate decade-long goal of making AR glasses – lightweight spectacles that users can wear all day and which overlay graphics on the real world.<br/>
<br/>
Cook has apparently made the glasses a "top priority" for the company. "Tim cares about nothing else," Gurman quotes a person with knowledge of the matter as saying. "It's the only thing he's really spending his time on from a product development standpoint."<br/>
<br/>
Meta is currently developing true AR glasses, and has already prototyped a version of the device it envisions bringing to mass market, dubbed <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/">Orion</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman notes that it will take "many years" for true AR glasses to be ready, with several technologies still needing to be perfected, including high-resolution displays, a high-performance chip, and a tiny battery that can provide all-day power.<br/>
<br/>
Meta's non-AR Ray-Ban glasses have reportedly been a surprise hit. These glasses are for taking pictures and conversing with an AI assistant. Apple is said to have discussed the possibility of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-still-exploring-smart-glasses-meta-ray-bans/">making similar glasses</a> to compete in the same space. Apple's rationale seems to be that creating smart glasses could be a precursor to developing true AR glasses further in the future. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is also said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-still-exploring-airpods-with-cameras/">adding AI-enabled cameras</a> to the Apple Watch and AirPods over the next couple of years.<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors about Apple's work on AR glasses – aka Apple Glass – for almost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/14/apple-ar-smart-glasses-in-development/">10 years now</a>, and the Vision Pro headset is what Apple built because the technology doesn't yet exist for the kind of augmented reality glasses that Apple is aiming for.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman has previously reported that Apple is conducting user studies at its offices to gauge the appeal of features and interfaces, and that the company is working on a version of visionOS that will run on glasses. Codenamed "Atlas," the studies are being led by Apple's Product Systems Quality team, part of the hardware engineering division.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-glasses/">Apple Glasses</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/apple-ceo-tim-cook-hell-bent-true-ar-glasses/">Apple CEO &#039;Hell Bent&#039; on Launching True AR Glasses Before Meta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-hell-bent-on-launching-true-ar-glasses-before-meta.2455275/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
