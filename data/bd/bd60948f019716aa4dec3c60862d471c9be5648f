<p id="p2">I&rsquo;ve been thinking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdmfFmwsGDo" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video by Theo Browne</a> for the past few days, especially in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-ipads-sweet-solution/" rel="noopener noreferrer">my story about working on the iPad</a> and realizing its best apps are actually web apps.</p>
<p id="p3">I think Theo did a great job contextualizing the history of <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electron</a> and how we got to this point where the majority of desktop apps are built with it. There are two sections of the video that stood out to me and I want to highlight here. First, this observation &ndash; which I strongly agree with &ndash; regarding the desktop apps we ended up having <em>thanks</em> to Electron and why we often consider them &ldquo;buggy&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  There wouldn&rsquo;t be&nbsp;a ChatGPT desktop app if we&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t have something like Electron. There wouldn&rsquo;t be a good Spotify player if we didn&rsquo;t have something like Electron. There wouldn&rsquo;t be all of these awesome things we use every day. All these apps&hellip; Notion could never have existed without Electron. VS Code and now Cursor could never have existed without Electron. Discord absolutely could never have existed without Electron.</p>
<p>  All of these apps are able to exist and be multi-platform and ship and theoretically build greater and greater software as a result of using this technology. That has resulted in some painful side effects, like the companies growing way faster than expected because they can be adopted so easily. So they hire a bunch of engineers who don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing, and the software falls apart. But if they had somehow magically found a way to do that natively, it would have happened the same exact way.</p>
<p>  This has nothing to do with Electron causing the software to be bad and everything to do with the software being so successful that the companies hire too aggressively and then kill their own software in the process.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">The second section of the video I want to call out is the part where Theo <a href="https://x.com/daniel_nguyenx/status/1734495508746702936" rel="noopener noreferrer">links to an old thread</a> from the developer of <a href="https://boltai.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoltAI</a>, a native SwiftUI app for Mac that went through multiple updates &ndash; and a lot of work on the developer&rsquo;s part &ndash; to ensure the app wouldn&rsquo;t hit 100% CPU usage when simply loading a conversation with ChatGPT. As documented in the thread from late 2023, this is a common issue for the majority of AI clients built with SwiftUI, which is often less efficient than Electron when it comes to rendering real-time chat messages. Ironic.</p>
<p id="p6">Theo argues:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote7"><p>
  You guys need to understand something. You are not better at rendering text than the Chromium team is. These people have spent decades making the world&rsquo;s fastest method for rendering documents across platforms because the goal was to make Chrome as fast as possible regardless of what machine you&rsquo;re using it on. Electron is cool because we can build on top of all of the efforts that they put in to make Electron and specifically to make Chromium as effective as it is. The results are effective.</p>
<p>  The fact that you can swap out the native layer with&nbsp;SwiftUI&nbsp;with even just a web view, which is like Electron but worse, and the performance is this much better, is hilarious. Also notice there&rsquo;s a couple more Electron apps he has open here, including Spotify, which is only using less than 3% of his CPU. Electron apps don&rsquo;t have to be slow. In fact, a lot of the time, a well-written Electron app is actually going to perform better than an equivalently well-written native app because you don&rsquo;t get to build rendering as effectively as Google does.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p8">Even if you think you made up your mind about Electron years ago, I suggest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdmfFmwsGDo" rel="noopener noreferrer">watching the entire video</a> and considering whether this crusade against more accessible, more frequently updated (and often more performant) desktop software still makes sense in 2025.</p>
