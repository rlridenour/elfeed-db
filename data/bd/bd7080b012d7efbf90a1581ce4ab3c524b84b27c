<blockquote>
  <p>For months, the Trump administration has been accusing its
political enemies of mortgage fraud for claiming more than one
primary residence. President Donald Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115092130707196133">branded one foe who did
so</a> “deceitful and potentially criminal.” He called another
“<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114857687712359546">CROOKED</a>” on Truth Social and pushed the attorney general
to take action.</p>

<p>But years earlier, Trump did the very thing he’s accusing his
enemies of, records show.</p>

<p>In 1993, Trump <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26342753-trump-mortgage-1993/">signed a mortgage</a> for a “Bermuda style”
home in Palm Beach, Florida, pledging that it would be his
principal residence. Just seven weeks later, he got <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26342754-trump-mortgage-1994/">another
mortgage</a> for a seven-bedroom, marble-floored neighboring
property, attesting that it too would be his principal residence.</p>

<p>In reality, Trump, then a New Yorker, does not appear to have ever
lived in either home, let alone used them as a principal
residence.</p>

<p><a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/06/wilhoits-law-conservatives-frank-wilhoit.html">Frank Wilhoit’s axiom</a> comes to mind: “Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.”</p>

<p>The difference between traditional conservatism — which hadn’t yet been washed away in 2018, <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288">when Wilhoit wrote it</a> — and today’s MAGA Republican cult is that in Trumpism, the in-group is just Trump, and whoever he sees as serving allegiance to him personally. It’s not men, not white people, not rich people, and not even rich white men, as a class. It’s just Donald Trump and those who pay personal fealty to him. Especially rich white men who pay subservient <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/09/trump-fifa-peace-prize">fealty to him</a>.</p>
