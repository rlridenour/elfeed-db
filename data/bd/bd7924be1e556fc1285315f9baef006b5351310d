<p>President Trump said Sunday he is “inclined” to keep ExxonMobil from investing in Venezuela after Exxon CEO Darren Woods told him in a White House meeting that the country was “uninvestable” under current laws. The remarks came during a Friday gathering with roughly 18 oil executives where the President pressed the industry to commit about $100 billion toward reviving Venezuela’s oil sector. Several executives signaled they would want Venezuela to offer stronger legal, financial, and security assurances before starting or expanding operations there, underscoring the gap between Washington’s push and boardroom risk concerns.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/k-kCgWjMitSeowSFL4zyw9tuAdOKCxvD0NeY9VqpUiiAObVxaBPqFgoUfXYzGgmQpUeaw3XFiKSPKV58meTB0JNp7r6c_u1eMFqujOuGnYy_bEbu4utFqzvKoAKbWli9xUTFP5TzpaodWdKacgTLWFtdHkAguysUjfNUgRh6tzWhtuMQkgduLlsBr0pn0V5Y944Y_y1rAIDo8l2ZoV8Jl2potI4lqsxYDZfBwvOIJaSVeaEr_tM1R4jm' alt='President Donald Trump speaks in Washington during the period of the Exxon-Venezuela remarks.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>White House tone: President Trump criticized Exxon’s stance as being “playing too cute,” framing the exchange as a dispute over corporate willingness to follow his Venezuela strategy.</li><li>Executive pushback: Other oil leaders at the meeting voiced similar hesitation, emphasizing the need for extensive protections and guarantees before committing personnel and capital on the ground.</li><li>Investment lever: The President floated using US government authority to restrict a specific company’s entry, signaling a more direct, company-by-company approach rather than relying only on broad sanctions policy.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: He said he may block ExxonMobil from investing in Venezuela and described himself as “inclined” to keep the company out after the CEO’s skepticism in the White House meeting.
