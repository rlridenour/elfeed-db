<blockquote>
  <p>When Welker tried to point out what the Fifth Amendment said,
Trump suggested that such a process would slow him down too much.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It seems — it might say that, but if you’re
talking about that, then we’d have to have a million or 2 million
or 3 million trials,” he said. “We have thousands of people that
are — some murderers and some drug dealers and some of the worst
people on Earth.”</p>

<p>“I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts
are holding me from doing it,” he added.</p>

<p>“But even given those numbers that you’re talking about, don’t you
need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as
president?” Welker asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Trump replied. “I have to respond by saying,
again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are
going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The oath of office, which Trump has now taken twice, is “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”</p>

<p>I’ll repeat <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/11/china-calls-trump-a-joke">what I wrote a few weeks ago</a> when the Chinese government correctly mocked Trump’s tariffs as “a joke in the history of world economics”: Democrats and all other Trump opponents should repeatedly call into question Trump’s mental fitness for office. Don’t (just) argue that he’s trying to subvert the Constitution as a WWE-style authoritarian, but argue (also) that he clearly doesn’t even remember the oath of office. He’s in early dementia. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump">Trump’s father was suffering from severe dementia</a> when he was Trump’s age. Throw Biden under the bus: remind people that <a href="https://apple.news/ANs1GK_4ISEikICuDBenaSA">we just saw</a> what happens when a mentally enfeebled 80-year-old<sup>*</sup> serves as President, and that under Trump it’s far worse. Biden was sleepy but steady; Trump is agitated and erratic. Only some dementia sufferers act lost and confused — others act out in anger and belligerence. Trump is in the latter group. He doesn’t remember the oath of office.</p>

<p><small>* Keep calling him “80”; make his sycophants correct you that he’s “only” turning 79 in June.</small></p>
