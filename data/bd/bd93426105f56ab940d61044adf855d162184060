"We are grateful for all those who fought for our freedom," said Cook, in a <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1926994228586090998">social media post</a> today. "On Memorial Day, we reflect on the courage and selflessness of the heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country."<br/>

Memorial Day is a federal holiday that honors and mourns U.S. military personnel who died while serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.<br/>
