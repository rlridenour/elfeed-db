The original Razer Boomslang was one of the first gaming mice, providing a wheel that boasted more precise mouse tracking than other mic on the market. The new model features a 45,000 DPI Razer Pro second-generation optical sensor, 4th-generation Razer optical mouse switches that prevent double-clicking and debounce delays, 8,000Hz hyperpolling wireless technology for lower latency, and an ambidextrous build with PU leather buttons for enhanced grip.<br/>

Razer is including a Mouse Dock Pro for magnetic wireless charging, plus the mouse supports 9-zone Razer Chroma RGB lighting that can react to more than 300 Chroma-integrated games. There are eight customizable buttons that can be used for shortcuts and macros.<br/>

Each Boomslang comes with a collector's LED display frame that features every element of the internal design.<br/>
