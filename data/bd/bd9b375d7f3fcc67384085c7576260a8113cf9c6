<p>The <code>*scratch*</code> buffer is the first thing I see when I launch an Emacs session. Coupled with <a href="https://github.com/Fanael/persistent-scratch">persistent-scratch</a>, it's served me well over the years. I gotta say though, my scratch buffer accumulates random bits and often becomes a little messy. It's not the most visually appealing landing buffer when launching Emacs. But who cares, I'm only a <code>C-x b</code> binding away from invoking <code>ivy-switch-buffer</code> to get me wherever I need to be. It's powered by <code>ivy-use-virtual-buffers</code>, which remembers recent files across sessions.</p>
<p>Having said all of this, I recently ran into u/pearcidar43's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/yamj5f/exwm_emacs_is_kinda_comfy_as_a_wm/">post</a> showcasing a wonderful Emacs banner. Lucky for us, they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/yamj5f/comment/itfusm0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">shared</a> the <a href="https://github.com/TanbinIslam43/mydotfiles/blob/main/.doom.d/emacs.png">image</a>, so I got curious about building a minimal welcome buffer of sorts. Nothing fancy, the only requirements being to load quickly and enable me to get on with my <code>C-x b</code> ritual. Throw in a little bonus to exit quickly by pressing just <code>q</code> if I so desire.</p>

<p>I didn't know a whole lot on how to go about it, so I took a peek at <a href="https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard">emacs-dashboard</a> for inspiration. Turns out, I needed little code to get the desired effect in my <code>early-init.el</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(defun ar/show-welcome-buffer ()
  &quot;Show *Welcome* buffer.&quot;
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*Welcome*&quot;)
    (setq truncate-lines t)
    (let* ((buffer-read-only)
           (image-path &quot;~/.emacs.d/emacs.png&quot;)
           (image (create-image image-path))
           (size (image-size image))
           (height (cdr size))
           (width (car size))
           (top-margin (floor (/ (- (window-height) height) 2)))
           (left-margin (floor (/ (- (window-width) width) 2)))
           (prompt-title &quot;Welcome to Emacs!&quot;))
      (erase-buffer)
      (setq mode-line-format nil)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (insert (make-string top-margin ?\n ))
      (insert (make-string left-margin ?\ ))
      (insert-image image)
      (insert &quot;\n\n\n&quot;)
      (insert (make-string (floor (/ (- (window-width) (string-width prompt-title)) 2)) ?\ ))
      (insert prompt-title))
    (setq cursor-type nil)
    (read-only-mode +1)
    (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer))
    (local-set-key (kbd &quot;q&quot;) 'kill-this-buffer)))

(setq initial-scratch-message nil)
(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)

(when (&lt; (length command-line-args) 2)
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda ()
                                  (when (display-graphic-p)
                                    (ar/show-welcome-buffer)))))

<p>This being Emacs, I can bend it as far as needed. In my case, I didn't need much, so I can probably stop here. It was a fun experiment. I'll even <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/commit/90c689def913a9bccdd408ef609c7f99a5cce1fb">try using it</a> for a little while and see if it sticks. I'm sure there's plenty more that could be handled (edge cases, resizes, etc.), but if you want something more established, consider something like <a href="https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard">emacs-dashboard</a> instead. I haven't used it myself, but is <a href="https://melpa.org/#/dashboard">pretty popular</a>.</p>
