 <i>For the Second Sunday of Pentecost</i>
</p>

 <p>
Isaiah spoke <br></br>
Of one who was <br></br>
Ugly, <br></br>
Despised, <br></br>
Rejected,
</p>

 <p>
One who knew pain, <br></br>
And suffering,
</p>

 <p>
One upon whom people would look, <br></br>
Then turn away in disgust.
</p>

 <p>
Yet it was our pain he bore, <br></br>
And our ugliness he assumed, <br></br>
Taking upon himself <br></br>
The shameful things inside <br></br>
That we keep hidden.
</p>

 <p>
We are like those <br></br>
Who saw only a homeless, itinerant Rabbi, <br></br>
But failed to see the one <br></br>
In whom the glory of God shone, <br></br>
When we see those who make us uncomfortable, <br></br>
And fail to see ones <br></br>
Whom you love <br></br>
And created in your image.
</p>

 <p>
God of grace and compassion, <br></br>
Forgive us. <br></br>
Open our eyes that we may see. <br></br>
Open our hearts that we may love.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
