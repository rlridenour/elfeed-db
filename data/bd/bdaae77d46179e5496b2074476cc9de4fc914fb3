<p>A series of avalanches in Austria’s Alps on Saturday left eight people dead, with incidents reported in multiple areas including Salzburg’s Pongau region. Several of those killed were skiing off-piste, and authorities linked the danger to recent heavy snowfall that has created unstable layers in the snowpack. Rescue teams responded quickly, but officials urged extreme caution as conditions could trigger additional slides.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eGKv_tfiSjTitgWniBbG7Fe_RRAo1OM891rg9ywIOTEp32ACydBXHsKpo5Zf1P2tbw6tp1UK--NlcMoIIbmitNF4SsmmApJ8XhoH9qNfCK81LZUnasx__2C-yJaRyhubRqgnFsE8IB9ku_LU8qbNZlAD7idCWPS42pGEhKEAavboZ5rf7Jz1uM0VPNAsjyC35BoudQ75jwAdFdJiEYreOA' alt='Rescuers search for avalanche victims in Austria’s Pongau region on Saturday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Two separate slides: Authorities said five skiers died in two avalanches in western Austria’s Salzburg Pongau region, with two additional skiers injured and one described as critically hurt.</li><li>Search response: Rescue helicopters, mountain rescue teams and Red Cross dog units were deployed to search avalanche debris and assist victims.</li><li>Snowpack mechanics: Officials warned that fresh snowfall has bonded poorly to older layers, a setup that can make repeated avalanches more likely even after a slide has already occurred nearby.</li><li>Alps-wide risk: Reports noted additional avalanche-related deaths in the Swiss and French Alps over the past week, underscoring that elevated hazard has extended beyond Austria after heavy snowfall.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Austrian officials and rescuers: They urged extreme caution in the mountains because recent snowfall has created unstable layering and a heightened risk of further avalanches.
