<p id="p1">Yesterday, <a href="https://parkerortolani.blog/2025/08/10/gpt-pushes-vibe-coding-beyond.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parker Ortolani wrote about several vibe coding projects</a> he&rsquo;s been working on and his experience with GPT-5:</p>

  The good news is that GPT-5 is simply amazing. Not only does it design beautiful user interfaces on its own without even needing guidance, it has also been infinitely more reliable. I couldn&rsquo;t even count the number of times I have needed to work with the older models to troubleshoot errors that they created themselves. Thus far, GPT-5 has not caused a single build error in Xcode.

<p id="p3">I&rsquo;ve had a similar initial experience. Leading up to the release of GPT-5, I used Claude Opus 4 and 4.1 to create a Python script that queries the Amazon Product Advertising API to check whether there are any good deals on a long list of products. I got it working, but it typically returned a list of 200-300 deals sorted by discount percentage.</p>
<p id="p4">Though those results were fine, a percentage discount only roughly correlates to whether something is a good deal. What I wanted was to rank the deals by assigning different weights to several factors and coming up with a composite score for each. Having reached my token limits with Claude, I went to GPT-o3 for help, and it failed, scrambling my script. A couple of days later, GPT-5 launched, so I gave that a try, and it got the script right on the very first try. Now, my script spits out a spreadsheet sorted by rank, making spotting the best deals a little easier than before.</p>
<p id="p5">In the days since, I&rsquo;ve used GPT-5 to set up a synced Python environment across two Macs and begun the process of creating a series of Zapier automations to simplify other administrative tasks. These tasks are all very specific to MacStories and the work I do, so I&rsquo;ve stuck with scripting them instead of building standalone apps. However, it&rsquo;s great to hear about Ortolani&rsquo;s experiences with creating interfaces for native and web apps. It opens up the possibility of creating tools for the rest of the MacStories team that would be easier to install and maintain than walking people through what I&rsquo;ve done in Terminal.</p>
<p id="p6"><a href="https://parkerortolani.blog/2025/08/10/gpt-pushes-vibe-coding-beyond.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">This statement from Ortolani</a> also resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote7"><p>
  As much as I can understand what code is when I&rsquo;m looking at it, I just can&rsquo;t write it. Vibe coding has opened up a whole new world for me. I&rsquo;ve spent more than a decade designing static concepts, but now I can make those concepts actually work. It changes everything for someone like me.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p8">I can&rsquo;t decide whether this is like being able to read a foreign language without knowing how to speak it or the other way around, but I completely understand where Ortolani is coming from. It&rsquo;s helped me a lot to have a basic understanding of how code works, how apps are built, and &ndash; as Ortolani mentions &ndash; how to write a good prompt for the LLM you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<p id="p9">What&rsquo;s remarkable to me is that those few ingredients combined with GPT-5 have gone such a long way to eliminate the upfront time I need to get projects like these off the ground. Instead of spending days on research without knowing whether I could accomplish what I set out to do, I&rsquo;ve been able to just get started and, like Ortolani, iterate quickly, wasting little time if I reach a dead end and, best of all, shortening the time until I have a result that makes my life a little easier.</p>
<p id="p10">Federico and I have said many times that LLMs are another form of automation and automation is just another form of coding. GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.1 are rapidly blurring the lines between both, making automation and coding more accessible than ever.</p>
