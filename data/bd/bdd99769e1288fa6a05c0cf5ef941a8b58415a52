         <p>In this ~30 minute video I show how to tell Emacs where to place
specific buffers. The idea is to have a set of rules that specify how
you want Emacs to make use of the available space in the frame and
which windows to use. Below I show some basic code samples. For more
advanced uses, refer to my relevant section in Emacs configuration:

<h2>Sample code with basic rules</h2>

        <span class="c1">;; The added space is for didactic purposes</span>

        <span class="c1">;; Each entry in this list has this anatomy:</span>

        <span class="c1">;; Match a buffer whose name is "*Occur*".  We have to escape</span>
