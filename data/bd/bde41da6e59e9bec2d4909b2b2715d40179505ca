We're likely just weeks away from Apple's next <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> launch, with the company set to introduce the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is a follow-up to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> that came out in February 2025, and rumors suggest that it could have some welcome improvements.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is supposedly going to look a lot like the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, featuring the same 6.1-inch display size, single-lens rear camera, and black and white color options.<br/>
<br/>
While the display isn't changing much, the device could have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> instead of a notch, which would be a marked visual difference.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="display">Display</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to feature the same display panel as the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, which means it will be limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. Apple brought 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates to the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> in 2025, but the same technology is not expected for the more affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.<br/>
<br/>
120Hz refresh rates provide video improvements and smoother scrolling when viewing webpages.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; does not have always-on display technology, and that's not likely to change with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e. To support always-on, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e would need an OLED display with 1-nit minimum brightness, which is limited to Apple's more expensive iPhones. HDR and brightness are also lacking compared to Apple's flagship lineup.<br/>
<br/>
Though the display isn't changing, there have been rumors suggesting Apple could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/iphone-17e-same-oled-panel-slimmer-bezels/">shrink the bezel size</a> somewhat, allowing for more visible display area.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="dynamic_island">Dynamic Island</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; continues to feature the notch that Apple has eliminated in its newer flagship iPhones, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e might do away with it. Rumors suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will have a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; instead of a notch, giving it a more modern look.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iPhone-14-Pro-Dynamic-Island.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003664" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; is a pill-shaped cutout on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display that houses the TrueDepth camera system and the front-facing camera. It takes up less display area than the notch, and it is better integrated into the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple uses software to change the size and shape of the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; to accommodate alerts, notifications, and Live Activities. The &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; can show everything from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> turn-by-turn directions to active timers, incoming phone calls, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> activations. It also displays privacy indicators for the microphone or camera, alerts when accessories connect, and indicators for the flashlight, screen recording, incoming AirDrop files, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; is much more interactive and useful than the notch, because there is an option to tap into the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; to access different app features.<br/>
<br/>
One rumor suggests the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/iphone-17e-same-oled-panel-slimmer-bezels/">continue to use a notch</a>, so the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; upgrade isn't a guarantee.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="a19_chip">A19 Chip</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to use Apple's A19 chip, which was first introduced in the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. The A19 chip is built using Apple's upgraded N3P 3-nanometer process, offering a 5 to 10 percent performance improvement over the A18 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could be planning to use a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/06/iphone-17e-dynamic-island-a19-chip/">downclocked version</a> of the A19 chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e, and if that's the case, its performance won't quite match the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;'s performance.<br/>
<br/>
The A18 chip that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; had a 4-core GPU instead of a 5-core GPU like the version from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, so the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could get a similar GPU downgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the improved CPU and GPU, the A19 has an updated display engine, image signal processor, and Neural Engine for improved AI performance. Every GPU core features a Neural Accelerator to boost the performance of local AI models.<br/>
<br/>
We are expecting the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e to continue to include 8GB RAM like the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;. Apple's other models have 12GB.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="magsafe_compatibility">MagSafe Compatibility</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; does not have a magnetic ring for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charging, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could feature &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; compatibility. Rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/iphone-17e-rumored-to-fix-iphone-16e-limitation/">magnetic wireless charging</a>, which would be a major upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's iPhones have used &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, so there are a wide array of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; cases and accessories. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is not compatible with these accessories, which is a major limitation.<br/>
<br/>
Since it doesn't have &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is limited to 7.5W wireless charging speeds. &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; would upgrade that to at least 15W. The current &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models can charge at 25W over &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, though the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> is limited to 20W.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to have a single 48-megapixel Wide Angle camera at the back, with no upgrade rumored. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; doesn't have a Camera Control button, and there's no word on whether Apple will bring it to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models got an upgraded 18-megapixel Center Stage front-facing camera, but rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will continue to use the same 12-megapixel front-facing camera as the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="modem">Modem</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will adopt Apple's C1X modem, the modem chip that Apple first debuted in the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;. The C1X modem is faster and more efficient than the C1 modem that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the C1X modem is up to 2x faster than the C1, and it is far more energy efficient than Qualcomm modems.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="no_n1_chip">No N1 Chip</h2><br/>
While the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models received Apple's new Wi-Fi and Bluetooth "N1" networking chip, leaked Apple code suggests the chip will not be included in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e in order to keep costs down.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;599, and no price changes are expected for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="launch_date">Launch Date</h2><br/>
Rumors suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is going to come in the first half of 2026, and Apple could stick to the February release timing. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; was introduced via press release on February 19, 2025, so we're probably not waiting on an event for the 17e.<br/>
<br/>
For that reason, it could come anytime in February, though there's also a possibility that Apple will hold it until the March or April timeframe. In late March or early April, Apple plans to release iOS 26.4 with a new version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, along with several updated home products.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-17e/">Apple&#039;s Next iPhone: What to Expect From the 2026 iPhone 17e</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-next-iphone-what-to-expect-from-the-2026-iphone-17e.2476366/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
