<p>I learned recently that the terminal has two different kinds of modes that can be set:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;termios&rdquo; modes, which
<ul>
<li>are managed by the operating system</li>
<li>you can view with <code>stty -a</code></li>
<li>are set with the <code>ioctl</code> system call</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;ANSI&rdquo; modes (not sure if this is the right name), which
<ul>
<li>are managed by the terminal emulator</li>
<li>you can&rsquo;t normally view, except in <a href="https://mitchellh.com/ghostty">GhostTTY</a>&rsquo;s inspector</li>
<li>are set by sending ANSI escape codes (like <code>&quot;\033[?25l&quot;</code> for &ldquo;make cursor invisible&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
