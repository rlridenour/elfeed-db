<p>The US House voted 215-215 to reject a Democratic-backed war powers resolution that would have required President Trump to withdraw US armed forces from Venezuela unless Congress explicitly authorized military action. The result keeps the White House’s latitude intact for now and underscores how closely divided Congress remains on how to oversee presidential use of force. The debate follows criticism from Democrats that the administration did not seek congressional approval for recent actions connected to Venezuela, while Republicans argued the resolution addressed a situation they say is not occurring.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/n3_dr0-kKyrYO58NTkiQWxCE3i-x5EJRIz-Z_0tBNwucveMCjdMzlAenyn56CdN7anzpHlWJxZVVkBvsIL25vb1b2s0gqMKwzRKIDGDN276BAF6ybQ0K-a2W40wRdCwm2qhIGpnmkLMC8C3zTzpmcqaoswXKpURN9rKWWJb5tXDKvkIv5UndOpm1pVAkqtC3lk6RjLoZlyt_jbTDQdS7N5x2bHVwS81g_KtyAdetJmjIsDf8EwZE-T1btOK1MYv6wab10kY3wCXIFrD9' alt='U.S. President Trump meets with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in the Oval Office, January 15, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Speaker pressure: The tied vote highlighted House Speaker Mike Johnson’s narrow margin and the difficulty of keeping a unified majority on national-security votes.</li><li>Senate parallel: A similar war-powers effort in the Senate ended in a tie last week before Vice President JD Vance broke the deadlock.</li><li>McGovern argument: Sponsor Rep.
