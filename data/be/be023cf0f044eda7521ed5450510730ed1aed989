<p>COP30 opened in Belém, Brazil on Monday with ministers and officials from nearly 200 countries gathering for two weeks of climate negotiations in the Amazon region. UN climate chief Simon Stiell urged cooperation, saying delegates should fight the climate crisis together, while hosts framed the meeting as a &quot;COP of implementation&quot; focused on delivering results. The United States federal government did not send a delegation, though US subnational leaders are present, and heavy rains briefly flooded entrances to the conference venue on opening day. Delegates arrive amid warnings that current national plans would only reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by about 12% by 2035 compared with 2019 levels, a shortfall that keeps global targets out of reach without faster action or new funding.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/WJNB19uTbmAiHmoI0QmHYe2YRBs54gpDB5BR0rkRi9Zw0COth7VNj5OpYzExrHMHvQ_xdWGQjaxmf3Psh7t3Nk9uoKcUCsYp7GF_rjjH' alt='Indigenous people in jubilant mood as they arrive at the venue of the opening ceremony of the COP30 summit in Belem.—Reuters' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Amazon venue: For the first time a COP is being held in the heart of the Amazon, with the summit sited in Belém to spotlight rainforest protection and local impacts</li><li>Agenda deal: Host Brazil brokered an opening agenda that pushed contentious items like carbon taxes and some financing proposals out of the core talks to preserve consensus-building</li><li>Finance divide: Vulnerable countries and several European governments pushed for tougher emissions goals while China and India pressed to re-open the debate on climate finance, highlighting a funding standoff early in negotiations</li><li>Disinformation watch: Online climate disinformation has surged this year; a viral claim misreported Bill Gates as a denier, whereas he published a memo calling for a strategic pivot toward adaptation rather than denial of climate science</li></ul><blockquote>Your job here is not to fight one another – your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together - Simon Stiell</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United Nations (UNFCCC / Simon Stiell): Delegates should cooperate rather than quarrel and make COP30 a place to implement and accelerate action.
