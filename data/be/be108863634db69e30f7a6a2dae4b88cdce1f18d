<p>First Violin: I, in love with the beauty of this world, endow it with my own beauty. The world has no abyss. Streaming out, my heart spends itself. I am only song: I sound.</p>
<p>Second Violin: For me, beside your more ethereal being, it is forbidden to have an I. Not the world &#8212; but more firmly and substantially: the earth has taught me. There it is growing dark. Let me accompany you, sister!</p>
<p>Viola: My grey hair makes it my duty to name the abyss for you. As you two childlike kindred spirits skim along, even the quarrel about nothing becomes attractive. But I suffer.</p>
<p>Cello: I know in my heart of hearts, that all is fate, the finely done and the unrelieved. I am true to the whole: enjoy life and repent! I do not warn. I weep with you. I console.</p>
