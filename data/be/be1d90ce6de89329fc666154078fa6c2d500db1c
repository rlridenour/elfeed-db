WhatsApp is testing a new feature that allows people to communicate with users over the platform even if they don't have an account.<br/>

According to <em><a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-25-22-13-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a></em>, the latest WhatsApp beta for Android contains references to so-called "guest chats," which lets users send a link to an online chat, where the "guest" doesn't have to have an app on their device or even need to be in possession of a WhatsApp account.<br/>
<br/>
To kick off a guest chat, the WhatsApp user has to invite someone from their contacts who doesn't have the app installed and share a chat link. When the recipient opens the link, they're granted access to an online end-to-end encrypted chat with the sender – likely via an interface similar to WhatsApp Web.<br/>
<br/>
As you might expect, there will be a few limitations to guest chats. Users won't be able to share media files like photos and videos, and guest chats won't support voice or video messages – only straight text. The mode will also be strictly one-to-one, so no group chats either. <br/>
<br/>
Further technical details on how the guest chats will be implemented have yet to be made available, but the general idea lines up with parent company Meta's efforts to comply with EU rules on platform interoperability. WhatsApp has been working on the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/whatsapp-interoperability-other-messaging-apps/">integrate third-party chats</a> from iMessage, Telegram, Google Messages, Signal, and others for some time.<br/>
<br/>
It's not clear when guest chats will become generally available, but barring some insurmountable technical hurdle, expect the feature to arrive in a future WhatsApp update for both Android and iOS.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/whatsapp-guest-chats-users-no-account/">No WhatsApp?
