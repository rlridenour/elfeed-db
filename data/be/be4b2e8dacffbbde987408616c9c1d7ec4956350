<p>The US military says it carried out an airstrike on a vessel in the eastern Pacific Ocean that it assessed was involved in drug trafficking, killing two people. US Southern Command said intelligence indicated the boat was traveling along known narco-trafficking routes. Officials described the action as part of a wider campaign targeting suspected drug-smuggling boats since early September 2025, a campaign that critics say raises human-rights concerns. The Coast Guard was notified to conduct search-and-rescue, and reporting across outlets notes at least one person survived, with accounts differing on whether the survivor was being searched for or already in custody.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/QHMH6DAKwrBpYabdpd5GrKZz3xUNBedyR9mfyCSvQR8wtIqPlGH-mSLIww-OC2DCYVdawptjoFYfJ07LIYoHKoYAn-RHqn_r6qqad9zyWM3GgO-YMJgUY_BqoBmCsoUaXIVNWhxgqQy46oS8Xw6MiaUMl-gdWdC_3CdH8KFM4EIUoh4mxzMD-tB2mKf78tVsSbpeoAYykmzgDw8oMFaUwViBogPN_nDEOipVE581wMdh9bFIYXBC395UCsIyBHUMX4lIcA98XOX6YFh-Pg' alt='A USCGC Vigilant is docked at Coast Guard Base San Juan, Puerto Rico (Dec. 31, 2025).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Strike count: CBS News reports this was the 35th US strike on alleged drug-smuggling boats since early September 2025.</li><li>Deaths tally: Al Jazeera says the broader boat-strike campaign has killed 125 people since September.</li><li>Post-raid context: Several outlets frame the strike as the first known boat strike since a US operation that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on January 3.</li><li>Rescue effort: US Southern Command said it alerted the Coast Guard to launch search-and-rescue operations after the strike.</li><li>Congress angle: The Globe and Mail notes the US House failed to pass a resolution aimed at reining in President Trump’s Venezuela war powers.</li></ul><blockquote>Intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations - US Southern Command spokesperson (statement)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Southern Command: Southern Command said intelligence showed the vessel was on known trafficking routes and involved in narco-trafficking operations, and it notified the Coast Guard for follow-on action.
