According to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-11/ventura-county-immigration-raid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>, the <a href="https://causenow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy</a> (CAUSE) learned of the raids, spread the word, and protestors and others arrived on the scene. &#8220;Federal agents had already closed off access to the worksite&#8230;. [One witness] said activists were trying to prevent trucks full of detainees from leaving.&#8221;</p>
<p>CSU Channel Islands and Glass House Farms are both located in the Camarillo area, and reportedly several members of the CSU Channel Islands community were in attendance at the protests.</p>
<p>Tear gas and &#8220;less lethal ammunition&#8221; were fired at the protestors and &#8220;at least one person was held at gunpoint after they tried to take out their phone and record the raid,&#8221; according to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-10/federal-immigration-sweep-ventura-county-farms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, and &#8220;multiple ambulances&#8221; went in and out of the farm.</p>
<p>After being tackled by agents, Dr. Caravello and others were arrested. According to a <a href="https://www.calfac.org/statement-condemning-the-abduction-and-disappearance-of-cfa-members-in-camarillo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> from the California Faculty Association (CFA), there are &#8220;unconfirmed reports&#8221; that Caravello is being kept at Ventura Federal Detention Center.</p>
<p>The statement from the CFA denounces the arrest of Caravello and others:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We strongly condemn the abduction of California Faculty Association professor, member and activist Jonathan A. Caravello, Ph.D. and other community members terrorized and arrested by federal immigration authorities while exercising their constitutional rights to protest peacefully in Camarillo, CA on Thursday, July 10th, 2025.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>These abductions are an attack on our constitutional rights to free speech. We do not tolerate retaliation against our union members or any person who speaks out against injustice. Their abduction and disappearance are part of an intentional effort, another tactic of the terror attacks at the hands of the current presidential administration on our communities. These actions further the enforcement of strict obedience to authority at the expense of our freedoms and our lives.</em></p>
<p>The CFA has set up a bail fund for Caravello; details on how to contribute are <a href="https://www.calfac.org/statement-condemning-the-abduction-and-disappearance-of-cfa-members-in-camarillo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a video originally posted on Reddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EyesOnIce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/EyesOnIce</a>), apparently narrated by a witness to the government&#8217;s attack on the protestors, that contains some footage from the event, as well as some information about Caravello, including that just the night before, he had spoken at a Camarillo City Council meeting to &#8220;defend his students from the most recent ICE raids&#8221; in the community.</p>
