<p>Russian drone strikes in southeastern Ukraine killed workers traveling by bus from a mine in the Dnipropetrovsk region, with reported death tolls varying by outlet, and injured additional passengers. Separately, strikes also hit Zaporizhzhia, including damage reported at a maternity hospital, as emergency crews responded to fires and casualties. Even amid the violence, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said another round of talks is expected next week, with several reports describing US-brokered trilateral discussions and some specifying Feb. 4–5 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The New York Times also noted the attacks occurred during a winter freeze and amid efforts by President Trump and others to push negotiations toward a truce.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Rvnod7-7bT9vL1KfSkkQwfQRt3jd0W4F_RkPM0kuKf8Po4efcPlEQ53B298mCVcpgEJvyFpftdB6q3AwKQ5un5cuY4oMSFMW4GqTdA_urrun8HeBkfPZYRyTsSXGZrT7l3gbRwYBEM_BtsKgFM24ZGG9cP3ZkOm_Y2DwAznKjg' alt='Aftermath image accompanying ABC News report on the Dnipro-area drone strike.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Where it happened: Ukrainian police said the miners’ bus was about 65 km (40 miles) from the frontline when it was struck.</li><li>Who was hit: Ukraine’s largest private energy firm DTEK said the dead and wounded were its employees returning from a shift, and officials described the strike as targeted at energy-sector workers.</li><li>Energy pressure: The New York Times reported Russia has heavily damaged Ukraine’s power grid this winter, and said the latest strikes hit the energy sector as temperatures dropped.</li><li>Infrastructure pledge: Zelenskyy said Russia had said it would pause attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure until Feb. 1, but Ukraine reported continued strikes on logistics.</li><li>Emergency response: Ukraine’s emergency services shared imagery of a charred bus with shattered windows after the strike, underscoring the scale of the blast and rescue work.</li></ul><blockquote>Today, the enemy carried out a cynical and targeted attack on energy sector workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region, - Denys Shmyhal</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine’s DTEK (energy firm): DTEK described the strike as a “massive terrorist attack” and said the victims were employees returning from work.
