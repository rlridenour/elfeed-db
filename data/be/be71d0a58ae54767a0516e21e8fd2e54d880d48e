<p>The US Congress passed legislation forcing the Justice Department to publish unclassified investigative files connected to Jeffrey Epstein after President Trump reversed his months‑long opposition and urged Republicans to back the measure; the House approved the bill 427–1 and the Senate agreed to clear it for the White House. Lawmakers and survivors say the move aims to provide answers to more than 1,000 alleged victims, and President Trump has said he will sign the bill if it reaches his desk. Officials caution that the Justice Department retains the authority to withhold material that could jeopardize active federal investigations, so full public disclosure is not guaranteed even if the bill becomes law.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/chfH5wiMPFm7Ro9IlQeA4s3hsQXg19_WKlnjOv9rmFFW8gVqO6lTrLClqR6wKxxAmRkjzbzcy3odm3Ui-kLwOZ_B65RWq2RlHcYo7tE8oVSwvkOwAFb0PDJGHfaK1od66RGxvWI0D77bgJmolH2b4NgfZ4KT3-TgQhmCVz8gH8FSTcffHSEBnLHxj3IgODM9lMlBALlecrRWv8NskSfi58dgCfQfAgyW77fOUIOsFJpWxKQRM1CPg7MVuFnXrfLJtLlBfw12WX6O40iCsA' alt='National Director of World Without Exploitation Lauren Hersh embraces a Jeffrey Epstein survivor as they react to the Senate&#x27;s passing of the bill to force release of files in Washington, DC.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Near‑unanimous tally: The House approved the measure 427–1, a rare bipartisan margin that rules out many proposed edits and pressured the Senate to move quickly.</li><li>Sole dissent: Louisiana Republican Rep.
