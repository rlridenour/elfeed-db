<blockquote>
  <p>Threads’ DMs are currently available to users aged 18 and over on
Android, iOS, <em>and the web</em>, but you can only have one-on-one
conversations right now. Moving forward, Threads plans to roll out
the ability to choose who can send you messages, including people
who don’t follow you on Threads and Instagram. You’ll also be able
to review a folder dedicated to message requests, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/2/23053114/twitter-direct-messages-dm-request-filter-secret-inbox-til">similar to
what’s offered on X</a>. Threads is working on a group messaging
feature and inbox filters, too.</p>

<p>Though the platform says its DMs are “protected by our robust
privacy standards, account protections and safety infrastructure,”
Threads spokesperson Alec Booker confirmed to The Verge that
“Threads will not support end-to-end encryption for messaging.”
Booker adds that Meta will “continue evolving DMs on Threads based
on feedback from the community.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The lack of E2EE for a new messaging platform in 2025 is unconscionable. Either don’t offer DMs at all or only offer them using E2EE. That would be for Meta’s benefit, not just its users. They shouldn’t even want the ability to look at private messages.</p>

<p>That said, I found myself chatting with an old friend on Threads last night, using the app on my phone. Somehow we’d never exchanged iMessage credentials. We more or less just used the Threads DM chat to exchange current phone numbers to move the chat to iMessage. Today, at my desk, I wanted to double-check that there was nothing in the Threads chat I’d want to save — and, I couldn’t figure out how to see DMs in Threads’s web app. I found a few articles, like the one above at The Verge, that said it <em>was</em> available on the web, but ... it isn’t. At least not for me, or most people. One never knows how many people are getting an A/B test or early rollout with Meta.</p>
