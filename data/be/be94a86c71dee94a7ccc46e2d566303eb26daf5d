<li>Put on an event on Friday night. We hardly sold any tickets in advance and 2 acts pulled out on the day. It was looking a bit bleak initially. When it came down to it, the turn out was alright, the room was full enough and the vibes were good. I was particularly impressed with Liverpool band <a href="https://ancienthostilityfolk.bandcamp.com/album/sing-as-loud-as-you-can">Ancient Hostility</a> and the experimental films of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thingsfoundandmade">Things Found and Made</a>.</li>

<li>Made a little progress on some studies in Krita. Working on the habit of getting started with something early before the day gets in the way.</li>

<p>Had to rebuild my Hugo site on Monday - deleted all the old posts (still have the markdown files locally). I would have had to go through all the old posts and adjust the formatting of the internal links. A lot were just event promotion or art dumping with little accompanying wordage anyway. I&rsquo;d prefer an almost clean state with just a few recent posts and build from that. That took more time out of my week than it should but I think I understand this theme better now.</p>

<li>Upped my average daily steps but not as many runs as I&rsquo;d like - I could blame the weather..</li>

<h2 id="watched-">Watched 📽</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Ugly Stepsister (2025)
<ul>
<li>A Norwegian &lsquo;The Substance&rsquo;. Similar themes of unattainable beauty standards with some gruesome body horror. It&rsquo;s a dark fairy tale/horror take on the Cinderella story. It&rsquo;s good, not for the squeamish. One you may need to recover from.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Flash (2023)
<ul>
<li>Mostly annoying multiverse stuff but was surprised to hear Michael Keaton&rsquo;s Batman is in it, so I had to check out those bits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dexter Resurrection
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m liking the female detective who &ldquo;sees things others don&rsquo;t&rdquo;. No idea what&rsquo;s going on with Uma Thurman&rsquo;s character yet? - some kind of secret society for serial killers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Narcos
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know why it took me so long to get around to watching this. Already feeling very absorbed after the first few episodes.</li>

<li>Trying out <a href="https://github.com/tanujnotes/Olauncher">olauncher</a> on my phone. It&rsquo;s a really simple, minimal Android launcher without any icons and just text.</li>
