<br/>
<h2>Is My iPhone Compatible With iOS 26?</h2><br/>

  <li>iPhone SE (2nd generation and later)</li>Note that this compatibility list does not mean that all iOS 26 features will work with the above models. Several of the update's features are exclusive to iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 models, since they rely on Apple Intelligence. You can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/all-ios-26-features-require-iphone-15-pro-newer/">learn more about them here</a>. Note that iOS 26 will come pre-installed on new iPhone 17 models when they launch in September 2025.<br/>
<br/>
</ul><h2>Should I Install iOS 26 Public Beta?</h2><br/>
Great question! Before downloading the update, it's worth noting that Apple does not recommend installing iOS 26 beta updates on your main iPhone, so if you have a secondary device, use that. This is beta software, which means there are often bugs and issues that pop up that can prevent software from working properly or cause other problems. Apple still has fixes to make before the final release later this month.<br/>
<br/>
<div id="backup"></div><h2>Make an Archived Backup of Your Device First</h2><br/>
Before installing the beta, make sure to <strong>back up your iOS device</strong> before installing the software using the following method, otherwise you won't be able to revert back to iOS 18 if things go wrong.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Plug your iPhone into your Mac using the supplied cable.</li><br/>
<li>Allow the accessory to connect by clicking <strong>Allow</strong> in the dialog prompt.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open a <strong>Finder</strong> window by clicking the Finder icon in the Dock.</li><br/>
 	<li>Click your iOS device's name in the sidebar.<br/>

 	<li>If this is the first time connecting your device to your Mac, click <strong>Trust</strong> in the Finder window.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/archived-backup1.jpg" alt="finder" width="2030" height="1408" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901468" /><br/>
 	<li>Tap <strong>Trust</strong> on your device when prompted, then enter your passcode to confirm.</li><br/>
 	<li>In the General tab, click the circle next to where it says <strong>Back up all of the data on your iPad to this Mac</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>If you want to encrypt the backup, check the box next to <strong>Encrypt local backup</strong>, then enter a password to protect your data.</li><br/>
 	<li>If you don't want to create an encrypted backup, or you've already set up encrypted backups, click <strong>Back Up Now</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/archived-backup3.jpg" alt="finder" width="1990" height="1364" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901469" /><br/>
</ol><br/>
When the backup is finished, you can find the date and time of the last backup in the <strong>General</strong> tab, just above the Manage Backups button. Remember that this backup will not be overwritten when you manually or automatically back up your iPhone in the future, so you can restore it at any time by using the <strong>Restore Backup...</strong> option in the same Finder screen.<br/>
<br/>

iOS 26 introduces a striking system-wide redesign built around Liquid Glass, a translucent material that reflects and refracts ambient content and dynamically responds to user input. The new aesthetic applies across the Lock Screen, Home Screen, toolbar controls, navigation elements, app icons, and widgets.<br/>
<br/>
The update also brings new Apple Intelligence features. With Live Translation available in Messages, FaceTime, and Phone, conversations across languages are now seamless and entirely on-device to ensure privacy. New Visual Intelligence capabilities mean you can ask questions about screen content. There are also smarter Shortcuts with intelligent actions to make automation easier.<br/>
<br/>
Communication apps gain smart upgrades too. The revamped Phone app now combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails in one view, adds Call Screening, and includes a clever Hold Assist feature. Messages gains filtered inboxes for unknown senders, typing indicators in group chats, custom backgrounds and polls, and Apple Cash transfers.<br/>
<br/>
CarPlay gets a visual refresh aligned with the Liquid Glass design and now includes compact call notifications, tappable Message reactions, pinned conversations, widgets, and Live Activities support.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also updated some of its key apps: Apple Music adds Lyrics Translation and Pronunciation plus AutoMix DJ-style transitions; Maps introduces privacy-protected "Visited Places" and smarter route preferences; Wallet supports installment/rewards payments, refreshed boarding passes with Live Activities, and deeper integrations with Maps and Find My. Lastly, a new Games app debuts as a central hub for mobile gaming, featuring a unified library, Apple Arcade support, event tracking, and friend status updates.<br/>
