<p><em>BlissLights BlissRadia Smart LED Entertainment Lamp and Night Light vs. Blorb, The Floating Orb</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>BlissLights BlissRadia Smart LED Entertainment Lamp and Night Light</strong></p>
<p><em>Pros</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Provides soft light that may help you relax or sleep.</li>
<li>Millions of color options and smooth gradient effects.</li>
<li>Allows you to set schedules or timers.</li>
<li>Easy to control with an app.</li>
<li>Compatible with Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cons</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Though the price is good today, it does cost money.</li>
<li>Have to remember to physically pick it up if you want to move it.</li>
<li>While Alexa/Google Assistant allows you to issue voice commands, you cannot have a conversation with it.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Blorb, The Floating Orb</strong></p>
<p><em>Pros</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No cost, just shows up one day</li>
<li>Millions of colors, gradient effects, patterns, faces, voices, etc.</li>
<li>Glow can be adjusted from soft to blinding with a mere voice command (no digital assistant required).</li>
<li>Can do more than just provide light. (For example: the other day, I was having trouble falling asleep because of something mean my coworker Dale said to me, and when I told Blorb, it not only said, “Rest, my friend,” in the exact way that made me fall asleep immediately, but also, the next day, Dale wasn’t at work, and not the day after that either, and actually he hasn’t come in for the whole week!)</li>
<li>A great conversation partner.</li>
<li>Follows everywhere, no power source required.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cons</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No app to control it.</li>
<li>No way to control it at all, actually.</li>
<li>It’s cool that Blorb takes action, but maybe it takes too much action? (Because, wow, sure are a lot of questions about Dale these days. Apparently, he’s not just skipping work; no one can get in touch with him at all.)</li>
<li>A single-user product, as apparently no one else can see Blorb? (I only learned this when the detective was asking me all these questions about Dale, and I was like, “Maybe you should ask Blorb,” and he said, “Who the hell is Blorb?” And when I pointed to Blorb, the guy was like, “There’s nothing there.” And now that detective is missing too, just like Dale.)</li>
<li>Blorb can apparently leave mud on boots and shovels.</li>
<li>Always follows, even when asked not to.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>
<p>While Blorb, The Floating Orb, has some great features, the BlissLights BlissRadia Smart LED Entertainment Lamp and Night Light is a safer, less complicated option.</p>
