<p>From Bismarck&#8217;s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=58ATAQAAIAAJ&#038;pg=PA246"><em>Reflections and Reminiscences</em></a>, 1898:</p>
<blockquote><p>
At the time of my first stay at St. Petersburg, in 1859, I had an example of another Russian peculiarity. During the first spring days it was then the custom for every one connected with the Court to promenade in the Summer Garden between Paul&#8217;s Palace and the Neva. There the Emperor had noticed a sentry standing in the middle of a grass plot; in reply to the question why he was standing there, the soldier could only answer, &#8216;Those are my orders.&#8217; The Emperor therefore sent one of his adjutants to the guard-room to make inquiries; but no explanation was forthcoming except that a sentry had to stand there winter and summer. The source of the original order could no longer be discovered. The matter was talked of at Court, and reached the ears of the servants. One of these, an old pensioner, came forward and stated that his father had once said to him as they passed the sentry in the Summer Garden: &#8216;There he is, still standing to guard the flower; on that spot the Empress Catherine once noticed a snowdrop in bloom unusually early, and gave orders that it was not to be plucked.&#8217; This command had been carried out by placing a sentry on the spot, and ever since then one had stood there all the year round.

<p>&#8220;Stories of this sort excite our amusement and criticism, but they are an expression of the elementary force and persistence on which the strength of the Russian nature depends in its attitude towards the rest of Europe.&#8221;</p>
