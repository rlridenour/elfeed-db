<p id="p2">One of my favorite aspects of macOS is the endless supply of great utilities for doing anything you can imagine. If there&rsquo;s something you want to do on your Mac, the chances are that there isn&rsquo;t just one good utility to accomplish your task; there are several.</p>
<p id="p3">My latest discovery is a file conversion and compression app called <a href="https://picmal.app" rel="noopener noreferrer">Picmal</a>. The app has a wonderfully simple, modern interface that sits on top of a lot of complexity, enabling batch conversion and compression with minimal effort.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-11-11-at-09-20-57-2x-1762870909990.png" alt="You can mix and match file types in one conversion or compression operation."><p class="image-caption">You can mix and match file types in one conversion or compression operation.</p></div>
<p id="p5">Picmal handles images, videos, and audio files in a single-window utility that features a Convert/Compress toggle at the top and a lot of empty space to start. The center of the window invites users to &ldquo;Drop Your Files Here.&rdquo; Once you do, the window animates into something a little closer to a Finder window with alternating white and light gray rows that make it simple to track metadata about each file.</p>
<p id="p6">Files can be dragged into Picmal from anywhere on your Mac, allowing for batch processing without moving your files to one location first, which I appreciate. Once converted, files are saved as new files in the folder they came from with a prefix or suffix that you can specify in the app&rsquo;s Settings. You&rsquo;re not limited by file type either. You can drag any combination of images, videos, and audio files into Picmal&rsquo;s window, picking and choosing what to convert them into as you go.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-11-11-at-09-23-31-2x-1762871055915.png" alt="For some file types, Picmal includes metadata."><p class="image-caption">For some file types, Picmal includes metadata.</p></div>
<p id="p8">Next to some file types is a small info button that reports the sort of basic file metadata you find in the Finder&rsquo;s info panel. That&rsquo;s followed by a column that lists the file&rsquo;s starting type, and a column with a dropdown menu for picking the destination file type. The list of supported file types is long, too, with the exact number of options dependent on the type you begin with.</p>
<p id="p9">If you want to check the file you&rsquo;re about to convert before doing so, there&rsquo;s also an arrow button on the far right of each file&rsquo;s row that will take you to it in the Finder. The other columns report the output file&rsquo;s size, any compression savings, and the status of each conversion. Whenever you want, you can add more files for conversion, kicking off a new batch once any ongoing conversions complete.</p>

<p id="p11">In my testing, Picmal performed well overall. I converted images, audio, and videos to and from a variety of common formats such as PNG, JPEG, PDF, MP3, AAC, WAV, MP4, and MOV. However, I did run into trouble trying to convert a 1.55&nbsp;GB MP4 of an episode of MacStories Unwind from MP4 to MOV. The conversion failed, even though much smaller files worked. Hopefully this is something that can be fixed in an upcoming update.</p>
<p id="p12">Another smaller issue I ran into is that there&rsquo;s a checkbox next to each file in the Picmal file conversion interface that appears to be intended as a way to change the conversion file type for multiple files at once. However, the dropdown that appears when selecting multiple files of the same type didn&rsquo;t give me an option to pick a new conversion type. The developer is aware of this and the large video file issue and is working to resolve both.</p>
<p id="p13">The other primary use for Picmal is file compression. The workflow is largely the same as converting files, with the size savings reported in a dedicated window column. By default, compressing files requires you to click on Picmal&rsquo;s Compress button, but you can change the process so that it happens automatically instead. From Settings, you can also add compression to your file conversions, completing both steps together.</p>

<p id="p15">Audio and video compression quality are set to 85% by default, while image compression quality is set to &lsquo;balanced.&rsquo; However, in each case, you can tweak the compression settings with more fine-grained controls. Another nice touch is that your compression selections and a link to Picmal&rsquo;s Settings are both accessible from the bottom of the Picmal window, making your compression choices clear and simplifying the process of making any adjustments.</p>
<hr id="hr16"><p id="p17">Aside from a couple of hiccups in my testing that the developer will likely have fixed soon, my experience with Picmal has been great. About the only thing I&rsquo;d love to see added is support for Shortcuts. Otherwise, Picmal is an excellent way to manage file conversion and compression jobs of any size. There are other apps that accomplish something similar, but the simplicity and speed with which you can manage batch conversion and compression with Picmal sets it apart and makes it worth checking out.</p>
<p id="p18">Picmal <a href="https://picmal.app" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available directly from its developer for $9.99</a>. That gets you the use of the app on one Mac at a time, which can be expanded to more Macs at an increasing per-Mac discount based on the number of licenses you purchase.</p>
