If you&rsquo;re one of those people who obsess about making every Emacs operation as fast as possible, James Dyer has quick tip for you. Dyer uses Dired a lot and one of his common operations is to search for a file in a Dired buffer using <code>isearch-forward</code> and then open it. Of course, he wants to make this operation as efficient as possible so he objects to the fact that he has to type <kbd>Return</kbd> twice: once to terminate the search and then again to open the file at point.

Dyer&rsquo;s tip <a href="https://emacs.dyerdwelling.family/emacs/20250513085926-emacs--instantly-open-dired-files-with-isearch-and-enter/">is a way of completing the search/open operation with a single return</a>. He does this with a bit of advice to the <code>isearch-exit</code> function. Check out his post for the details.

Dyer admits that this is a small thing and even makes a back of the envelope calculation of how long it will take him to recoup the time he spent implementing the solution. Of course, sometimes it&rsquo;s the journey and what we learn along the way that&rsquo;s important and this is probably one of those times.

Regardless, if you find yourself often searching for and opening a file in Dired, you may find Dyer&rsquo;s tip useful. At least you will if you care about saving a keystroke with each operation.</p>
