<p>Five years ago, Apple released the first M1 Macs. It&#8217;s hard to overstate how significant that moment was, not just for what it delivered technically, but for what it meant about Apple&#8217;s commitment to the Mac. Because the years leading up to that launch were rough.</p>



<p>The butterfly keyboard was a disaster. Not just for its initial failure, but also for Apple’s slow response and eventual correction. There was also way too much thermal throttling. Most frustrating was the long delays between updates that delivered the smallest incremental improvements (and more butterfly keyboards).</p>



<p>It felt like Apple had lost the plot on what made the Mac great in the first place. A lot of us wondered if Apple still understood the Mac, or if it had become an afterthought to the iPhone business.</p>



<p>Then the M1 arrived, and everything changed. I remember the jump from my last Intel Mac to that first Apple Silicon machine. It was one of those rare, obvious leaps you don&#8217;t see often in computing anymore. Like going from a spinning hard drive to an SSD. The speed, the battery life, the silence. It wasn&#8217;t just faster.</p>



<p>It was fundamentally different. Better in ways that affected every single interaction with the machine.</p>



<p>Five years later, Apple is still nailing it with the Mac. The MacBook Air is shockingly capable. The MacBook Pro is genuinely pro again. The Mac Studio and Mac Mini are giving people exactly what they need for desktop workflows. The only outlier is the Mac Pro, which feels adrift right now. But otherwise? The Mac lineup is in better shape than it&#8217;s ever been. And it all traces back to that decision to take control of the silicon.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s remarkable is that Apple doesn&#8217;t seem to be slowing down. The M5 family is just starting to arrive, and it&#8217;s another meaningful step forward. These machines keep getting more powerful while staying power efficient and cool.</p>



<p>The Mac isn&#8217;t just recovered from those dark days. It&#8217;s thriving. Five years in, Apple Silicon still feels like the beginning of something rather than a finished story.</p>
