Everyone&#8217;s eyeing the iPhone 16 Pro, but there’s a tug-of-war between the Pro and the regular iPhone 16. With new features like the camera control button and iOS 18’s Apple Intelligence Summaries, they weigh the pros and cons. AirPods Pro Gen 2 get serious attention too, with their hearing aid features and active earplugs, sparking a discussion on managing hearing loss and breaking the stigma of wearing hearing aids.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch Series 10’s upgrades, including a titanium option and faster charging, are tempting, but the team’s decisions are still up in the air. With the costs adding up, Jeff suggests checking Best Buy Open Box and Apple Refurbs to avoid overpaying. As the hosts navigate their potential purchases, their advice is clear: don’t get caught buying the wrong tech for your needs.</p>
