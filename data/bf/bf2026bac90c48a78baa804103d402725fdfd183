<p>Dozens of journalists returned their badges and vacated offices inside the Pentagon on Wednesday after refusing to sign a new Defense Department access policy that took effect this week [pbs.org#1][aljazeera.com#1]. The Pentagon had set a Tuesday deadline for outlets to accept the rules or lose credentials and workspace access [scmp.com#1]. News organizations say the policy threatens press freedom and would hamper independent coverage, while the U.S. government has described the rules as &quot;common sense&quot; [scmp.com#1][euronews.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#1]. More than 30 outlets declined to sign, including Reuters, reducing the on-site media presence at the U.S. military headquarters [scmp.com#1][straitstimes.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/bot6sGZq7V6uEe1uU5sEvxb7bRxDk0CeF6iFq3Q-ORe1_ZLYn2CqZIAH85yuAxLDzvWvdwcDjuK5F1YLGusGFGINJHqifgMPY7hzV2hH-1IFJwuXFelfwP9UgHnFZzHTVFyNcWtfEiTI_FcjJwQDA68FKO_oqEz0n_2dVcdhZRvo9br2eU93IaIQ1m3kTBsn82TfHoYMntiILBmKKTtMe6583ywEzrr6ILzn1tH3Z-vbFWdTe10-osOgK8CCNJ063ndCAfKHlJ-E88qZWw' alt='Members of the media pack up their belongings and leave the Pentagon.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Policy mechanics: Outlets that declined to sign the new access policy forfeited building credentials and press workspaces as the rules took effect [scmp.com#1][aljazeera.com#1].</li><li>Rule scope: The policy could expose reporters to expulsion for pursuing information not approved for release by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, including unclassified material [theglobeandmail.com#1].</li><li>Press rationale: News organizations cited threats to press freedoms and to their ability to report on the Pentagon as reasons for rejecting the policy [scmp.com#1][euronews.com#1].</li><li>Who declined: Reuters was among the organizations that refused to sign, joining more than 30 outlets in vacating the Pentagon [scmp.com#1][straitstimes.com#1].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. government/Defense Department: Officials have described the new reporting rules as &quot;common sense.&quot;.
