<p>Myke Hurley:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For this episode, I took a slightly different approach for the
main section, following step-by-step how John writes and publishes
an article. I think this is a template I want to follow with
future guests, taking a detailed look at what they do from
beginning to end.</p>

<p>I’m so pleased with how this interview turned out — I actually
think it may be one of the best of my career. I’ve never had the
chance to have a one-on-one podcast with John before, and I’m
happy we waited until now to make it happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We spoke for a long time, and at some point like halfway through, it really hit me that Hurley was asking <em>really</em> good questions. If you’re interested in how I work and the tools I use, you should enjoy listening to this interview as much as I enjoyed participating in it.</p>
