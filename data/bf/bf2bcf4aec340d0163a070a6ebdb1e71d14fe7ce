Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Apple offered a line of Wi-Fi routers that it referred to as AirPort base stations. There was a standard AirPort Express, a higher-end AirPort Extreme with more advanced networking features, and an AirPort Time Capsule that doubled as an external storage drive for backing up a Mac with Time Machine.<br/>

A few days ago, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/11/apple-vintage-products-2013-mac-pro/">added a few more AirPort models</a> to its obsolete products list, which reignited discussion about the products.<br/>
<br/>
The big question: Will Apple ever return to the Wi-Fi router market?<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/26/apple-officially-discontinues-airport-wireless-router-lineup/">discontinued the AirPort line in 2018</a>, but the company could return to the Wi-Fi router market in an unexpected way in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Back in December, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">developing its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a> that will debut <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/">in new Apple TV and HomePod mini models later this year</a>. He said the chip is "so sophisticated" that it could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/22/apple-not-working-on-new-airport-routers/">"theoretically" turn these devices into a wireless access point</a>. However, it is unclear if Apple will actually follow through with that idea, so temper your expectations for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's chip will support Wi-Fi 6E, according to Gurman, whereas the final AirPort models supported what is now known as Wi-Fi 5. However, Apple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu believes the chip will actually <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-17-air-wifi-7-rumor/">support Wi-Fi 7</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It remains to be seen if the Apple TV and HomePod actually become Wi-Fi routers, but Apple is seemingly developing technology that allows for it.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/13/apple-airport-might-return-in-unexpected-way/">AirPort Base Stations: Will Apple Ever Return to Wi-Fi Router Market?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airport-base-stations-will-apple-ever-return-to-wi-fi-router-market.2461476/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
