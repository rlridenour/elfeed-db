Apple today provided developers and public beta testers who have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 11 with a new beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>. Apple did not seed the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 version of the &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; public beta yesterday, but it's out now. The update has a build number of 23A5297n, which is different from the 23A5297m public beta that other testers received. <br/>

Public beta testers with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 can download the beta software using the Software Update section of the Settings app. Developers with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 will also see an update. Apple says that the beta fixes an issue that could cause an issue with the way that folders are displayed on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>. <blockquote>Fixed: On iPhone 11, if you have organized apps into folders on your Home Screen, you might only see the leftmost column of the grid of apps when opening a folder. The other two columns in the folder do not display the app icons, preventing users from launching those apps</blockquote>iOS 26 features Apple's new Liquid Glass design aesthetic, with a focus on translucency and glass-like interface elements. The design extends to the Lock Screen, &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;, and Control Center, along with menus and buttons in apps.<br/>

Apple's software includes features for apps like Messages, Phone, Shortcuts, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, along with new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features, a revamp for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, and more. <br/>
