<p>The U.S. military struck four vessels in the eastern Pacific on Monday, killing 14 people and leaving one survivor, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said; the Pentagon described the targets as narcotics-trafficking boats and said they posed a threat to U.S. cities . The strikes are part of an intensified campaign the U.S. launched in early September against maritime drug shipments, with officials saying the operations extend beyond the Caribbean into the eastern Pacific . U.S. officials released footage of the strikes and described the dead as &quot;narco-terrorists,&quot; while some regional leaders and commentators have demanded explanations and raised legal and evidentiary questions .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/aqHCfHs2D1pVTohgHJDkad_A0WNBU_w1HG3LcZIwcO9NGGdt3V2wHexB9bta9JVrdb85IQJ6dpIYV-6BXBr7RF4goRzyoaw1htL43nDjjEaFxZmhKYUqR80zgoW459vmHGPhyg6cRFosjmaHLrk0qasZ9yxgW59BxNUnJNdpAuxJkMVAZZr9D9KCTccheHe2z7BZ6FCrJPbmlKaouQO_V55JJNCv11G7jxQaAhySXaaqRitchan35dvtWA' alt='One person is believed to have survived the latest round of strikes, according to reporting' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Campaign scope: Officials say the broader operation has struck at least 13 vessels since early September, bringing an acknowledged campaign toll to about 51 people killed in recent weeks</li><li>Deadliest day: Monday&#x27;s strikes were described by U.S. officials as the single deadliest day of the campaign to date, with three strikes reported in one operation</li><li>Evidence concerns: Independent outlets note Washington has not publicly released detailed evidence proving each targeted vessel carried narcotics, prompting calls for more transparency from regional observers</li><li>Visual record: The Pentagon released video showing boats engulfed in flames after strikes, and U.S. media circulated footage as part of official briefings and reporting</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. Department of Defense (Pete Hegseth): The strikes targeted vessels the Pentagon says were trafficking narcotics and killed individuals characterized as narco‑terrorists during operations in international waters.
