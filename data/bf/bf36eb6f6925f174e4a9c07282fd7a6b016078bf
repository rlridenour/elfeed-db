<p>While I&rsquo;m overall happy with my Thelio Mira, it has been collecting &ldquo;issues&rdquo; to the point that I think of wiping it and starting fresh. To be fair, this is probably my fault for installing and downloading different libraries and half-baked programs without giving it a second thought, and basically being a bad Linux citizen.</p>
<p>I feel I miss Linux Mint. Mint (especially Cinnamon) is more polished and finished than PopOS&rsquo;s desktop environment. While it comes with a nice window management snapping system, I never got quite used to it and found that the keyboard shortcuts don&rsquo;t always work. It&rsquo;s&hellip; fine, it does the job, but it&rsquo;s not a feature I absolutely must have. I know System76 is working on Cosmic, but it&rsquo;s still in alpha.</p>
<p>I do use this computer mainly for gaming. Popos comes with an application &ldquo;Store&rdquo; that has Steam and NVIDIA drivers ready to install, but when you have experience tweaking games to work on Linux you go get what you need yourself rather than rely on a store that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/1k2ho5y/nvidia_driver_upgrade_fails_from_pop_os_store/">tends to break when you installed said drivers and has you working in terminal to fix what it broke</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, PopOS does feel more snappy, and things install and run on it quickly. It doesn&rsquo;t have all the bells and whistles Mint does, but I&rsquo;m not sure I need those. Besides, Mint has its own share of problems too; I know nostalgia plays a part in this as well.</p>
