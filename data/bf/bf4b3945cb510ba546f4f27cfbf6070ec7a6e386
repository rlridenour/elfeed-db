Apple devices support a relatively unknown three-finger gesture that lets you share a photo across your devices in super-quick time. It's a neat trick to fall back on if AirDrop is playing up or your iCloud Photos are taking ages to sync. <br/>

Universal Clipboard is usually associated with copying and pasting text, but by using this gesture, you can make it work really well for sharing images between your devices too.<br/>
<br/>
It can be used to quickly copy images across nearby devices for pasting into Messages, Notes, emails, Pages, and other apps with input fields.<br/>
<br/>
For the following steps to work, you'll need to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on and your devices signed into the same Apple Account and connected to the same network. <br/>
<ol><li>Make sure Handoff is enabled on your devices: On Mac, select <strong>System Settings ➝ General ➝ AirDrop & Handoff</strong> and toggle on the switch next to <strong>Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices</strong>. On iPhone/iPad, turn on <strong>Settings ➝ General ➝ AirDrop & Handoff</strong>, then toggle on the switch next to <strong>Handoff</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>On iPhone or iPad, perform a three-finger pinch gesture on a photo. On Mac, use the <strong>Command+C</strong> keyboard shortcut.</li><br/>
<li>Switch to the device you want to share the photo with, and then pinch outward with three fingers to paste it into a text field. If on a Mac, you can perform this gesture on the trackpad or use the <strong>Command+V</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/share-gesture-ios.jpg" alt="" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956745" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. You will know that your three-finger gestures have been recognized when "Copy" and "Paste" appear at the top of the device's screen.<br/>
<br/>
Tip: You can also cut images to Universal Clipboard using the same three-finger pinch gesture by performing it two times in rapid succession. Just remember to paste your content within a short period of time, as it won't be available for ever.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/instantly-share-photos-apple-devices/">Use This 3-Finger Trick to Quickly Share Photos on Apple Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/use-this-3-finger-trick-to-quickly-share-photos-on-apple-devices.2455760/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
