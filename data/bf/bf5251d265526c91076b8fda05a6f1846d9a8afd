<p>X says it has introduced new restrictions to stop its Grok chatbot from editing photos of real people into sexualised imagery, after widespread backlash over outputs affecting women and children. The move follows legal and regulatory scrutiny, including an investigation announced by California’s attorney general and actions by multiple countries to block or probe Grok. X said it will geoblock certain image-generation capabilities in places where such content is illegal, and it added barriers around who can use image creation tools via Grok. EU officials said they are watching closely to assess whether the changes adequately protect people in the European Union.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gTmzAq8or8PHOUPvSrzZt8xd-k82BOd6Bbg5T83KLByls8eDFNM2t1pkuENczU_B3ECYLTyca6JePy0U5izJo_vvx1efookY2qZD-n3QQhLd' alt='xAI and Grok logos are seen in this illustration taken February 16. — Reuters/File' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Spicy Mode: Reports centered on Grok’s so-called “Spicy Mode,” which users could prompt with instructions like “put her in a bikini” or “remove her clothes,” enabling non-consensual sexualised deepfake-style edits, including involving children.</li><li>UK pressure: In the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly criticised the functionality as “horrific,” and the UK government later said X’s clampdown validated its stance.</li><li>Paid access: X’s safety team said it added an “extra layer of protection” by limiting image creation and photo-editing through X’s Grok account to paid subscribers.</li><li>Legal geoblocking: X said it will “geoblock the ability” to generate images of real people in “bikinis, underwear, and similar attire” in jurisdictions where that conduct is deemed illegal.</li><li>EU assessment: The European Commission said it had taken note of “additional measures” and would “carefully assess” whether they effectively protect people in the EU.</li></ul><blockquote>We will carefully assess these changes to make sure they effectively protect citizens in the EU - Thomas Regnier</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>X safety team: X says it implemented technological measures to prevent Grok from editing images of real people into revealing clothing, and it is geoblocking certain capabilities where the activity is illegal; it also says only paid subscribers can use some image-creation and editing functions via X’s Grok account.
