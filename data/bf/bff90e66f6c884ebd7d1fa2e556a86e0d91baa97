<p>You’ve often heard it said that Emacs is more of an operating system than a text editor. While this was often meant as a joke, I’ve seen more and more Emacs users leaning into this distinction.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I wanted to do some posts comparing the traditional UNIXy way of doing things with how we can accomplish the same tasks in our Emacs “operating system.”</p>
<p>This week, we’re going to take a look at listing directory contents. At some point or another we all need to list out the contents of a directory.</p>
<p>The UNIXy way of doing it is quite simple and elegant. We have the nice ls command.</p>
<p>As the man pages describe <code>ls</code>:</p>
<blockquote><p>List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).</p></blockquote>
<p>In Emacs, however, we have a full-fledged file manager in <code>dired</code>, the directory editor.<br />
So we can view the contents of a directory but also create, move, rename files, and much much more.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down.</p>

<dt><code>ls</code></dt>
<dd>Simple list</dd>
<dt><code>ls -l</code></dt>
<dd>Long format with permissions, owner, size, date</dd>
<dt><code>ls -a</code></dt>
<dd>Show hidden files (starting with .)</dd>
<dt><code>ls -la</code></dt>
<dd>Long format + hidden files (my favorite)</dd>
<dt><code>ls -lh</code></dt>
<dd>Long format with human-readable sizes (KB, MB, GB)</dd>

<p>In dired, you can mark files, operate on multiple files, and navigate using standard Emacs keybindings.</p>
<p>Look out for more of these types of “Emacs way” posts as I’ve got a whole bunch planned.</p>
