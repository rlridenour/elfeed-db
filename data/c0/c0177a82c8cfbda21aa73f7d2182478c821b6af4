<p>I've jumped on the Emacs 29 bandwagon! Mickey Petersen has a great rundown of <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/whats-new-in-emacs-29-1">What's New in Emacs 29.1</a>.</p>
<p>Now every so often, I need to take a quick peek at an <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite3</a> table. Emacs 29.1 ships <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Database.html">sqlite-mode</a>, which can help with that. Use <code>sqlite-mode-open-file</code> to open a database.</p>
<p>Pressing <code>RET</code> on a table shows its content via <code>sqlite-mode-list-data</code>. <code>DEL</code> does as you'd expect and delete a row via <code>sqlite-mode-delete</code>.</p>
