<p>Benedict Evans, tweeting on Threads this week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple thinks an awful lot about customer delight and customer satisfaction…</p>

<p>And separately, a whole other part of Apple treats its suppliers with quiet ruthlessness, squeezing them for every penny of margin.</p>

<p>And at some point Apple forgot that its developers are both customers and suppliers, and treated them like suppliers alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is also why Phil Schiller has a different perspective on the App Store than Tim Cook or Luca Maestri. Schiller has been involved with developer relations at Apple for decades, since long before the iPhone even existed. In the mid-1990s, Schiller left Apple for a few years and was a senior executive at Macromedia, maker of then-essential design tools for the Mac. He knows that developers <em>need</em> to be treated as partners by Apple, that that’s the only way a platform can thrive. Games are different, but for all other apps, Apple should view developers as a precious resource to be cultivated, encouraged, and protected — not as a profit center to be squeezed. The only benefit from developers to Apple that Apple should be concerned with are the first-class apps those developers are creating to enrich and broaden Apple’s platforms. Especially apps that are exclusive to Apple’s platforms. (Why doesn’t Apple offer a lower App Store commission for platform-exclusive apps? What if the split were 70/30 for cross-platform apps but 90/10 for iOS/Mac-exclusive apps?)</p>

<p>I’m quite certain that everyone at Apple, right up to Tim Cook, would swear up and down that Apple <em>does</em> value third-party developers and does <em>not</em> treat them like they do suppliers.</p>

<p>But ask iOS and Mac developers, small or large, whether they agree with Evans’s succinct summary above. I don’t know any who wouldn’t agree that Evans’s pithy take is largely, if not entirely, true. You’ll have to ask them in private, though, because, like Apple’s suppliers, they’re afraid to speak in public about the App Store.</p>
