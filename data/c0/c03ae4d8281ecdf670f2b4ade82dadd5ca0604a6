When the results of the State of Emacs survey came out I was really surprised to see that its most reported programming use was in Python. There are some definite biases in the survey participants – I think it was slanted to media used by new users, which were much more plentiful than I expected but obviously much less than the full emacs-using population. Nonetheless I did not at all expect Python to top the language list ahead of Emacs&rsquo; classic best-of-class support of lisps like my Clojure, which was down in the middle of languages reported.
