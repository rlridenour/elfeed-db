<p>President Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act on Wednesday, directing the Justice Department to publish records from its investigations into Jeffrey Epstein and related matters, a move that follows heavy pressure from lawmakers across the aisle. Congress advanced the measure with overwhelming support in the House and unanimous consent in the Senate, and Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will make material public within 30 days while preserving narrow exceptions for sensitive material. Supporters called the step a victory for victims and transparency, while critics warned that redactions, procedural delays or ongoing probes could limit what the public ultimately sees.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/WkAXOwrIr51aExrrHpJbG3esZb7eTEBjMV6RvihpPKvsRmzDfLfyRe6XuCXuOi-o2ksrwK0zC-uUPYxytKv4NluAcpWRb3Ctj3bTQJLLrgmVHTlD9vGvAZUR83RLDz4oeURaCj1Vprno4tw2Tm8goZ6wRnfYx28o1I075xr_mvg3zw0l9OizpTGkWMUmc7URgAnx0Umc61KGTJdqIIZ4j1wCJFAA8L1caeBoYEQNj4cD5GvBK9JY_jDVhKbup8WestRmOSKNs1eitSyRMQ' alt='President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting at the White House (file photo).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>House vote: The House approved the measure 427-1, with Rep. Clay Higgins the sole dissenting vote, after sponsors said they pushed the bill through to force public disclosure.</li><li>Searchable records: The law requires unclassified materials to be posted in a searchable electronic format, a step advocates say will aid researchers and journalists tracking connections.</li><li>What may be withheld: Legal exemptions in the statute and Justice Department practice allow withholding of victims&#x27; personal details and information that could jeopardize ongoing investigations.</li><li>Risk of delays: Lawyers and observers warned the administration could rely on redactions, renewed probes or procedural reviews to limit disclosure even after the president&#x27;s signature.</li></ul><blockquote>Once the president signs the bill, he must apply and execute it faithfully. There must be no funny business from Donald Trump. - Chuck Schumer</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Trump said he had signed the bill and used social media to argue Democrats had used the Epstein issue to distract from his administration&#x27;s record, framing the move as politically charged.
