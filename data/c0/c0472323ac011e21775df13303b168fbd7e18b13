<p>In 2014, three truck drivers sued Oakhurst Dairy of Portland, Maine, alleging that they&#8217;d been unfairly denied four years&#8217; worth of overtime pay. Maine law generally required time-and-a-half pay for each hour worked above 40 hours, but it listed exemptions for:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of:</p>
<p>(1) Agricultural produce;</p>
<p>(2) Meat and fish products; and</p>
<p>(3) Perishable foods.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s not quite clear. Does the law exempt the <em>distribution</em> of the three categories listed, or does it exempt <em>packing for</em> shipment or distribution of them? The confusion shows the value of the so-called Oxford comma, the often-skipped comma that follows the next-to-last item in a series, as in &#8220;A, B, and C.&#8221; A comma after &#8220;shipment&#8221; would have eliminated the ambiguity in the language above; the drivers&#8217; lawyer said, &#8220;That comma would have sunk our ship.&#8221; But without the comma, the court ruled, the meaning is uncertain, and the dairy had to pay the drivers $5 million.</p>
<p>In 2017 the state legislature replaced the troublesome passage with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The canning; processing; preserving; freezing; drying; marketing; storing; packing for shipment; or distributing of:</p>
<p>(1) Agricultural produce;</p>
<p>(2) Meat and fish products; and</p>
<p>(3) Perishable foods.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/us/oxford-comma-maine.html">wrote</a>, &#8220;So now we get to replace Oxford comma pedantry with semicolon pedantry.&#8221;</p>
