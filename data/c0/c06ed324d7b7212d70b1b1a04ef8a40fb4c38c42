<p>Paris’s Louvre museum will significantly increase admission prices for visitors from outside the European Union and wider European Economic Area from mid-January, in a bid to strengthen security and modernise its aging building after a recent high-profile theft and years of heavy wear from mass tourism. From January 14, 2026, most non-EU tourists, including travellers from the United States, Britain and China, will pay about €32 (around US$37), up roughly €10 from the current standard rate, while prices for EU, Icelandic, Liechtenstein and Norwegian visitors remain unchanged under existing rules. Museum officials say the 45% increase could add as much as US$23 million in annual revenue, earmarked for structural repairs, gallery upgrades and enhanced security systems as the world’s most-visited art museum works to better protect its collections and improve visitor experience. The change comes as the Louvre tries to balance accessibility with the costs of preserving a centuries-old palace that hosts tens of thousands of people on busy days and is planning an ambitious renovation programme.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lUvjLmzm6Wq8h4cTu07zMbs51Bfx5DncL8Nm6pSzGb6I71UGEoGWtJC77zGC7_X7CGFjG0rjpsObqzMIEpou7lFN5zg64ZsJ4VwAXNjLvEXfsl2q4D7P8gFqe2gA9BPvNlHEEOhsQr1YQQBNoTfdmlEBbwMo6hjMVetABBfUGjzJhFRLUQUEHAmsDMFf3AhrwUwDHczFCw' alt='The Louvre in Paris, whose leaders plan security and renovation work funded in part by higher tickets for non-EU visitors.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who pays more: The higher tariff will apply to visitors from countries outside the European Union and the European Economic Area, notably including major tourist markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom and China.</li><li>Revenue destination: Louvre management expects the additional tens of millions of dollars generated annually to be dedicated to reinforcing building structures, refurbishing galleries and funding upgraded surveillance after a recent daytime jewelry theft.</li><li>Security concerns: The decision follows an October break-in in which thieves stole jewelry worth about US$100 million from a museum gallery, prompting renewed scrutiny of security at the historic complex.</li><li>Visitor volume: As the world’s most-visited art museum, welcoming millions of people each year, the Louvre faces unusually high maintenance and staffing costs to manage crowds and preserve fragile artworks in a former royal palace.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Louvre museum leadership: Museum officials frame the price revision as a way to finance structural improvements, modernised galleries and reinforced security measures without raising costs for visitors from EU and EEA countries, who are covered by existing pricing policies.
