<p>I’m going to wax a little philosophical for this week’s column, which also happens to be my last.</p>
<p>Stay Foolish debuted ten years ago, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/225409/apples-tv-play-wont-be-first-but-it-could-be-the-best.html">almost to the day</a>, but I’ve been writing regularly for Macworld for nearly twenty years. When I first started out, we were all excited about what the latest in technology—Intel-powered Macs—would mean for Apple’s long-term prospects for survival. Two decades later, nobody ever even whispers that Apple is doomed anymore, because to suggest it would mark you as somebody divorced from reality.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to overstate just how different the Apple of today is from the Apple of 2015 or 2006. In taking a retrospective look at Apple, we most often find ourselves comparing the enormously successful behemoth that Apple now is to the company’s nadir in the mid-90s, when it was just steps from going out of business. But the truth is that even in just the last decade or two the company has reached heights that seemed previously unattainable.</p>
<p>And somewhere along the way, I think the relationship of the company to its customers—and vice versa—changed as well. It’s something that I’ve found myself thinking about <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/europe-gives-apple-a-chance-to-change-its-tunebut-will-it/">more and more in recent years</a>. But is it me that’s changed, or is it Apple? I think probably a little of both.</p>
