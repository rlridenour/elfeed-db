<p>In 1906, as George Bernard Shaw and his wife were looking for a house in rural Hertfordshire, they came upon a tombstone in Ayot St Lawrence:</p>
<p>Mary Ann South<br />
Born 1825, Died 1895<br />
Her Time Was Short</p>
<p>When asked why he chose the village as his home, Shaw said that if the biblically allotted threescore years and ten was considered a short life in Ayot, it must be a good place to live.</p>
