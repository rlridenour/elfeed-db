Does Emacs run slower on macOS than it does on a similar machine running Linux? I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve been running Emacs almost exclusively on macOS for somewhere around 17 years so its performance on macOS, whatever it is, seems normal to me.

Over at the Emacs reddit, staff-engineer says that he runs it on both macOS and on Linux. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1qlnde7/emacs_linux_vs_macos/">The Apple machine is, in fact, more powerful than the Linux one but is nevertheless less performant when running Emacs and staff-engineer wonders why</a>.

He received several excellent answers that are definitely worth reading but I especially like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1qlnde7/comment/o1fq5lj/">the one from totbwf</a> who explains that a large part of the problem is that macOS uses a tiny size for its pty buffers and that this can significantly slow down Emacs when it calls an external process using a <code>process-connection-type</code> of <code>pty</code>. His solution to this is to simply advise functions calling <code>start-process</code> to use pipes instead of ptys. He says that this can speed up these actions by a factor of 10. For Magit, he says that you can get the same result by simply setting <code>magit-process-connection-type</code> to <code>nil</code>.

Even if you don&rsquo;t want to add a lot of advises to your configuration, it may be worthwhile making this one simple change to Magit if you use it a lot.

To be honest, I have no idea if these fixes will work or not but they&rsquo;re easy to try if you feel Emacs is too slow on macOS. If changing the connection type helps, I would think that someone would fix it in Emacs core for macOS installations. It doesn&rsquo;t sound like it would be too hard but one of the problems is that there are few Apple users helping with development.</p>
