<p>I’ve always had a soft spot for indie Mac developers — especially those who build tools that quietly make your Mac better. Eternal Storms Software is a great example, and right now they’ve got a special&nbsp;<a href="https://eternalstorms.at/bundle/"><strong>bundle deal</strong></a>&nbsp;that’s worth checking out.</p>

<p>This bundle includes four of their best-loved apps:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Yoink</strong>: A smart little shelf that makes drag-and-drop a whole lot easier. I’ve used Yoink for years — it’s one of those “how did I live without this?” utilities. Just drag a file to the edge of your screen, and Yoink gives you a temporary holding space to keep things tidy while you navigate between apps or Finder windows.</li>



<li><strong>ScreenFloat</strong>: Ever needed to keep a reference image, receipt, or bit of text visible while you work? ScreenFloat lets you snap screenshots and have them float above everything else. It’s perfect for research, design work, or anytime you want to stop flipping between windows.</li>



<li><strong>Transloader</strong>: This one’s a gem for folks who juggle Macs and iOS devices. You can send download links from your iPhone or iPad straight to your Mac, where the file downloads automatically. No more emailing yourself links or awkward AirDrop workarounds.</li>



<li><strong>Deskmat</strong>: Need to share your screen on a Zoom call? Invoke DeskMat and cover all the clutter. It&#8217;s really that easy.</li>
</ul>



<p>What I love about all four of these apps is that they solve small, real-world annoyances in elegant, Mac-native ways. They’re lightweight, thoughtfully designed, and just… helpful. You won’t find bloat or subscription nags here — just solid utilities that do their job well.</p>



<p>And right now, you can grab all four at a discounted price in the&nbsp;<a href="https://eternalstorms.at/bundle/"><strong>Eternal Storms Bundle</strong></a>. Whether you’re already a fan of one or two of these apps, or just want to explore some new Mac superpowers, it’s a great deal.</p>
