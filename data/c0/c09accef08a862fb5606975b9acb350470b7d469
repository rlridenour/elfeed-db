<p>Backups feel safe, but they are only useful if you can restore them when the unexpected occurs.<br>Many operators treat backups as a safety net; few test that net for real resilience.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why Verification Matters</h3>



<p>A backup that never proves itself is a paper weight in your disaster plan.<br>If the archive is corrupted or paths are wrong, recovery stalls and confidence erodes.<br>Decision makers expect certainty, not hope.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">BorgBackup – The Trusted Tool</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">Borg</a> compresses, deduplicates, and encrypts; it also checks integrity on every run.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>borg check</strong> scans all chunks for cryptographic mismatch.</li>



<li><strong>Sample restore</strong> pulls a file to verify paths and permissions.</li>



<li><strong>Checksum comparison</strong> ensures data matches the source exactly.</li>
</ul>



<p>These steps turn an archive into a living contract with your system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Automate, Test, Repeat</h3>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Automated Backups</strong> – nightly Borg runs triggered by cron or systemd timers.</li>



<li><strong>Weekly Verification</strong> – run <code>borg check</code> and restore a random file from each repo.</li>



<li><strong>Alerting</strong> – send minimal, encrypted notifications via SSH tunnel to your monitoring server.</li>
</ol>



<p>A single failure in the restoration chain can cost days of uptime; automate its detection.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Documentation &amp; SOP</h3>



<p>Store verification steps in an org‑mode file, encrypted with GPG.<br>Keep the SOP short: Backup → Check → Restore Sample → Verify → Document.<br>When you can’t confirm a restore, consider the backup dead.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Decision Makers – Your Role</h3>



<p>Enforce resilience without adding noise.<br>Make verification part of your compliance checklist; it is a silent safeguard that only works when tested.</p>



<p>Implement these practices today.<br>Treat backups not as a checkbox but as an active, verified component of operational integrity.</p>
