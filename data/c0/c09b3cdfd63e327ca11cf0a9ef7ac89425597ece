</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Reflecting on a handful of blog posts, joining in a conversation regarding hard mode, simplicity, and relying on others to do the hard stuff.
</p>
        <p><time datetime="2025-06-12" title="2025-06-12">Earlier this week</time> I read Joan’s <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-cult-of-hard-mode-why-simplicity-offends-tech-elites/">The Cult of Hard Mode: Why Simplicity Offends Tech
Elites</a>, something I had skipped over until I read Jack’s <a href="https://baty.net/posts/2025/06/hard-mode-and-status/">Hard Mode and status</a>
(and follow-up <a href="https://baty.net/posts/2025/06/hard-mode-and-blogging/">Hard Mode and blogging</a>).</p>
<p>Jack writes quick thoughts, fluttering between changing out entire tool sets for
his various workflows.  Joan writes extended thoughts, creating a pathway that
explores the thought and relations.</p>
<p>I love both of their blogs: one an excited friend sharing their moments another
a more quiet person, but one that when they speak, I know I should give a
listen.  Crucial to both is that I receive their thoughts on my terms.</p>
<h2 id="interviews-as-opportunities">Interviews as Opportunities</h2>
<p>For the last few weeks I’ve been part of a team interviewing candidates Sight
Reliability Engineers and/or DevOps positions.  I have nominal experience with
Kubernetes, but I’m gaining an understanding of the response to questions around
Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Namely that there are responses that are a ritual invocation of a litany of
phrases that will sequentially check off some bingo card.  And there are
responses that will skip over most of that and leave mental energy for follow-up
questions.</p>
<p>The former, an explanation of the <em>ad nauseam</em> variety; the other an
acknowledgment that its complex, with an implicit “what specifically would you
like to know?”  And the most flowing interviews are those that dive into
specifics.</p>
<p>In other words, the candidates that can paint a picture of the problems they
solved, not the tools they used, are far more interesting.  They become a chance
for bi-directional learning.</p>
<h2 id="can-we-learn-something">Can We Learn Something?</h2>
<p>I think to an interview years ago, for a different role (Copyright Librarian for
those keeping track).  I don’t remember the specifics, but I remember leaving
with a solid understanding of an Academia-endemic organizational problem, along
with a straightforward strategy of addressing that problem.</p>
<p>Later, I would go on to build a software application that applied the strategy
of addressing the problem.  The result, a collaborative workflow application
that had a data driven state machine, with optional and required activities
which upon completion would expose different actions to advance state.  It also
enforced state based permissions.</p>
<p>The participants in this workflow were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graduate students submitting their master’s thesis or doctoral dissertation.</li>
<li>Professors, both research advisors and committee members; some of whom may not
be at the organization but were on the committee that would approve the
submission.</li>
<li>The Graduate School administrator who would both nudge things along; helping
people at their stage, and also themselves performing specific duties.</li>
<li>An IT Department agent that would poll the data to understand the where things
were at in regards to graduation and credentialing.</li>
<li>A library unit who would catalog the research papers.</li>
<li>An library agent who would ingest the cataloged papers into the institutional
repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>The machinery was complicated, but the tool was designed to be simple for each
participant.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-my-tools">Back to My Tools</h2>
<p><time datetime="2025-06-10" title="2025-06-10">Earlier this week</time> I wrote about 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/06/10/emacs-take-two/">Emacs: Take Two</a></cite>; and what might have nudged me
to adopt <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
 earlier.  A long-standing joke is that <span>Emacs</span>
 is a great operating
system that needs a better text editor.</p>
<h3 id="denote">Denote</h3>
<p>I appreciate the simplicity of <span><a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote">Denote</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Denote”" title="Other site-wide references of “Denote”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-DENOTE">&#128214;</a></small>
’s naming scheme.  The file to which I’m
writing this blog post is named
<code>20250612T081424--re-the-cult-of-hard-mode__blogPosts_emacs_responses.org=</code></p>
<dl>
<dt><code>20250612T081424</code></dt>
<dd>the identifier as well as date and time I created the file.</dd>
<dt><code>--re-the-cult-of-hard-mode</code></dt>
<dd>the title of the document I&rsquo;m working on.  With
dashes separating words, and replacing most non-alphabetical characters with
dashes.  The leading double dash is a separating between identifier of title.</dd>
<dt><code>__blogPosts_emacs_responses</code></dt>
<dd>the tags of this document, each tag separated
by an underscore.</dd>
<dt><code>.org</code></dt>
<dd>the file extension (e.g., indicating <span><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" title="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-ORG-MODE">&#128214;</a></small>
).</dd>
</dl>
<p>This <em>simple</em> naming schema, which itself is configurable, brings a
strategic consistency to filenames; one independent of <span>Emacs</span>
 and <span>Org-Mode</span>
;
leaning on a lower level standard: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#bodyContent">POSIX</a>.</p>
<p>The brilliance of <span>Denote</span>
 is in its facilitation of this simplicity, making it
easy to follow and utilize a file naming convention.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> I worked at a library, and it was maddening how inconsistent the department
was in regards to naming and organizing their files.  If you do one simple
thing, prefix all of your files with <code>YYYYMMDD</code> (year, month day).  The ability to
sort (and search) on that alone is worth the discipline.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
 And from that convention
allowing the emergence of tools.</p>
<h3 id="integration">Integration</h3>
<p><span>Emacs</span>
, for me, simplifies the integration of different computering activities.
Were <span>Emacs</span>
 a toy, it would be a jumbled of old Lego pieces (or an Erector Set or
Lincoln Logs) and other apps would be things like Play Mobile.</p>
<p>In isolation, each application may be simpler, but the unifying computering
simplifies the cognitive load of my interaction with computer tasks.  Consistent
keybindings, fully customizable, allow me to build a muscle memory that persists
across computer tasks…so long as they happen in Emacs.</p>
<p>There is the allure of shaving the <span>Emacs</span>
 yak; that is fiddling with features and
tweaks—which comes in the form of writing Lisp.  Something I find myself doing
on occasion.  But even that fiddling is like practicing musical scales with my
foundational computering environment.</p>
<h2 id="the-bespoke-beast">The Bespoke Beast</h2>

<blockquote  class="h-cite" cite="https://copingmechanism.com/posts/2025/06/hard-mode-and-blogging/">

As much as I love the idea of static websites, it&rsquo;s hard to argue that they&rsquo;re
not the &ldquo;hard mode&rdquo; of blogging.

<footer>&mdash;
<span class="p-author h-card">Jack Baty</span>, <cite><a href="https://copingmechanism.com/posts/2025/06/hard-mode-and-blogging/" class="u-url p-name" rel="cite">Hard Mode and Blogging</a></cite>
</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>I fully agree with this statement.  Yet, for me, blogging is an activity that
springs from a myriad of my computering interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal journal</li>
<li>Reading an article from my <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">Rich Site Summary</a></span> (<abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" title="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-RSS">&#128214;</a></small>)
 feed</li>
<li>Analyzing and gathering material for documentation at work</li>
<li>Stringing together some code snippets</li>
<li>Playing a solo role-playing game session</li>
</ul>
<p>And the act of publishing is two fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transforming/projecting that writing into an acceptable file format (e.g.,
Markdown)</li>
<li>Sending it forward into the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet the blog posts remain within the context of what and where I&rsquo;ve written.
Something that my Bespoke Beast allows.  And for myself I value that cohesion.
Which is not to say that I couldn&rsquo;t maintain that cohesion using a blogging
platform; but it would push the complexity elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="hosted-services">Hosted Services</h3>
<p>I pay for a static host; agreeing that all I have is a file system that can
serve up files.  I have offloaded to the hosting company the complexity of
keeping up-to-date a web server (Apache or Nginx).  I pay them to keep that
simple for me.</p>
<p>I can pay for them to manage more of my complexity, thus creating a localized
and relative-to-me simplicity.  I can invoke the wizard’s spell <em>Transmute Cash
to Simplicity</em>.  And do so often.</p>
<h2 id="simplicity-as-honeypot">Simplicity as Honeypot</h2>
<p>But that invocation means becoming beholden to the simplifier.  Perhaps what I
send to the simplifier becomes no longer available in the form I sent it.
Perhaps the receiver operates with an agenda that remains opaque to me; and
perhaps run contrary.  And maybe they themselves simplify through spell, by
casting a complexity to another.</p>
<p>Collectively perhaps we’re navigating the web of inter-dependency hoping to push
complexity elsewhere and to secure localized simplicity.  We can see this in
Vibe Coding, in which simplicity of developing something new stands on the
mathematically mulched and composted remains of the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>And my hope is not that this is read as an excoriation of Jack…who moves amongst
different tool sets with an admirable fluidity, demonstrating an adaptive
mindset and mental plasticity.  Instead, to push a bit on potential false flags
of simplicity.</p>
<p>As there are honeypots out there, offering simple experiences, that ensnare;
seeking to feast on the weary or ease seekers.</p>
<p>So, I look to simplicity with caution, especially in regards to the breadth of
computering.  Something offered to me as a simple approach may be a tar pit.
Perhaps luring me in.  Or perhaps for which I am the bait.</p>
<h2 id="better-off">Better Off</h2>
<p>I often think of Eric Brende’s <cite data-id="630E5AE2-C671-45CB-BF0B-2907D655991D">Better Off</cite>.  In part as I’ve long lived in
Amish country, and his story is one of Amish-mindsets in regards to technology
adoption.</p>
<p>In short, in my area of Amish communities, many have flip phone, electric bikes,
solar panels, and some electric machinery.  And these are “allowed” their
governing bishop.  Because as a community they have assessed that this
technology is a net positive.  Making easier the business of woodworking and
errand running.</p>
<p>My computering needs have greatly narrowed: Emacs is my go to for computering
except when I need Javascript enabled web-browsing functionality.  I do leverage
supporting infrastructure for privacy: namely a <span>Virtual Private Network</span> (<abbr title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Virtual Private Network”" title="Other site-wide references of “Virtual Private Network”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-VIRTUAL-PRIVATE-NETWORK">&#128214;</a></small>)
 and Open Snitch.</p>
<h2 id="on-status">On Status</h2>
<p>I wrote this to think through my principles of computer tool adoption.  And as I
was writing this the known-to-me complexity of our present state of computer use
became clearer and grew.  The world wide web (of technology) is complex and
massive, with participants operating with a myriad of agenda.</p>
<p>While writing I didn’t reflect on the other aspect…the “Hard-Mode as status.”  I
know that I’ve been proud of the once hard-to-me things that I’ve done; sharing
the results in part seeking the affirmation of others.</p>
<p>Listening and hoping to hear the whispers of “That Jeremy, he’s not afraid to
tackle the hard things.  And share what he’s done.”  My ability to solve
problems is what pays my bills, and these “hard things” are my signaling a
capacity for problem-solving.</p>
<p>An admixture of hubris and attention-seeking.  One that I’ve sought to temper by
interrupting my problem solving preferences of idea generation and
implementation to introduce up front clarification.  To be able to name an
observed problem and sit with the impact of that problem.  Some problems
dissolve under a bit of reflection.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I cannot express enough the joy of reading articles that are in conversation.
Also in having a space in which to respond—thinking aloud—and thus enjoin the
conversation.</p>
<p>To think and write not in interruption but as birdsong in the forest that is
this world.</p>
