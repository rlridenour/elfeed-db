<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=M6QxAQAAMAAJ">Aphorisms</a> of German physicist Georg Lichtenberg (1742-1799):</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Passionate ambition and suspicion I have invariably found to go together.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;It is in most cases more difficult to make intelligent people believe that you are what you are not, than really to become what you would appear to be.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;True, unaffected distrust of human power in general is the surest sign of mental ability.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I am convinced that we not only love ourselves in others, but hate ourselves in others too.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Where moderation is a fault indifference is a crime.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I suppose there never was a man of any great mark who was not slandered; or hardly any blackguard who never directed a slander against some man of merit.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Mankind loves company, even if it is no more than that of a burning candle.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;It is a fact that there are numbers of people who read merely that they need not think.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;With most people unbelief in one thing is founded upon blind belief in another.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;What is very rare seldom remains long unexplained. What is inexplicable is usually no longer rare, and has perhaps never been so.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;The commonest opinions and the things that everybody takes for granted often the most deserve examination.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;That in advancing years we should grow incapable of learning has some connection with age&#8217;s intolerance of being ordered about, and a very close connection, too.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I have looked through the list of illnesses, and did not find cares or sad thoughts mentioned among them. That is a mistake, surely.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Saints in stone have done more in the world than living ones.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Has anyone, I wonder, ever dreamt of odours, without an external cause to give rise to the impression? &#8212; dreamt, for instance, of the smell of roses, when there was no rose or rosewater in the vicinity. With music this is certainly the case, and with light too; but feelings of pain in a dream usually have some external cause. As regards odours I am uncertain.&#8221;</p>
