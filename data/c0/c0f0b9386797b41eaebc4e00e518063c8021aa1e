<p>After reading the quite interesting post <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/post/blue-sky/">Blue Sky</a>
by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zamansky.bsky.social">Mike Zamansky</a> I decided to begin
my gentle migration to <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>, a new and promising social media platform.</p>
<p>I completely agree with Mike&rsquo;s opinion on Twitter as well as other
social platforms. Like many of us, I migrated from
<a href="https://x.com/ODeuteronomy">Twitter</a> &ndash; keeping my existing account
there &ndash; to <a href="https://emacs.ch/@olddeuteronomy">Mastodon</a>.
Unfortunately, Mastodon, largely due to its distributed architecture,
seems to be more fragile than other platforms &ndash; recently, I have been
warned that <a href="https://emacs.ch">emacs.ch</a>, a fediverse server I have been using for two
years now, is about to shutdown in this December.</p>
<p>Sure, there is a (bit complex) way to transfer your Mastodon account
to another server &ndash; and here is <a href="https://fedi.tips/transferring-your-mastodon-account-to-another-server/">detailed explanation</a>
on how to do that. Perhaps, I will do that in the nearest future, but
who can guarantee that the new server is immune from the same fate?</p>
<p>Anyway, Bluesky looks promising and I decided to give it a try.
