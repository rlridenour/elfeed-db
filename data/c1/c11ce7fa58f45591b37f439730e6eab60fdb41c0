Yesterday, <a href="https://www.guidetogreatness.com/">Cyndi Laurin</a> presented at the 2012 <em>World Business Capability Conference</em> in Auckland about <em>The Four Pillars of Organizational Greatness</em>. Cyndi discussed one analogy that stuck in my mind as it took me back to my days as a <a href="https://horizonofreason.com/">philosophy student</a>.</p>
<p>
Cyndi asked which part of a car is the most essential. The audience mentioned several options, and then it dawned on me that this analogy is much like a famous line of reasoning in Buddhist philosophy about the self, which I will use to show that there is no such thing as an organisation and that no one part of an organisation is essential or more important than another.</p>

The idea of the firm in Buddhist management
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The Buddhist management view of the firm would be that there is no such entity, illustrated by a debate between King Milinda and the Buddhist monk Nagasena.</p>
<p>
Following the analogy used by the monk, we can compare a firm with a chariot, or in more modern terms a car. None of the individual parts of the car (the wheels, the engine, the radio and so on), <em>are</em> the car. Nor can you say that the combination of the parts is the car. We can not discover a firm at all, only the word that denotes the idea of the business. </p>
<p>
A business consists of its parts, just like a car does. None of the components of the firm, however, <em>are</em> the firm. No part is less important than the other—although followers of the Lean philosophy will disagree on this one.</p>
<p>
The Buddhist management argument extends to management in that a firm is not about its constituent parts, but a firm is a cycle of cause and effect, or in Buddhist terms, <a href="https://horizonofreason.com/culture/karma-dharma-moksa/">Karma</a>. A firm is not about its CEO, the share price, employees, customers or fancy headquarters. A company, just like a person, is defined by the actions it takes and their results.</p>
<p>
Following the Buddhist view to its conclusion, there is only one pillar of organisational greatness: the actions taken by the organisation and the impact these actions have on the beneficiaries.</p>
