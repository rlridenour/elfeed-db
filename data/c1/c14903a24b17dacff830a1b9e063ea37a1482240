<p>The last movement of Mahler&#8217;s sixth symphony calls for the sound of a hammer, which the composer indicated should be &#8220;brief and mighty, but dull in resonance and with a non-metallic character (like the fall of an axe).&#8221; (The two blows represent the death of Mahler&#8217;s daughter Maria and the diagnosis of his heart condition.)</p>
<p>Because no recognized instrument exists to fulfill this function, symphonies have had to devise their own solutions, often striking a wooden box or bass drum with a mallet or sledgehammer. Houston Symphony percussionist Brian Del Signore built a 22-pound custom hammer and a wooden box to receive the blow.</p>
