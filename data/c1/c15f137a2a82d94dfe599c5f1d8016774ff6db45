<p>President Trump has proposed a new “Board of Peace” to help oversee governance and reconstruction in Gaza as the next phase of the ceasefire plan moves forward, and many countries say they have received invitations. Several governments are still trying to understand how the body would operate and how it would relate to existing UN-backed frameworks, with some critics warning it could sideline the United Nations. Early responses have been mixed: Morocco says it accepted an invitation to join as a founding member, while others—including France—have publicly declined, citing concerns about the board’s charter and scope.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DIoW01ojoQ3yo537peLmFPda2fIiTbN6Zf3uo84s4RwxEC4N8qbP-XPkHwV2DeX_gHnmk3HvhZhuX8OW25ckT1JSfP3AMb5dR5_Cxe3FJm83Hni0kgUDA4lt9Fl_MNeCATvLz5A9EEZP6ag9f7W3azJzco2dHWpHy0ffHw5a_WbNjrB44fMLqTLIYegT_mCb8gFugk2qCAfgAefSrAQyqqOgNDQSyAs' alt='President Trump is proposing a new international body to oversee Gaza’s postwar transition and rebuilding.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Paid permanence: A U.S. official confirmed that a $1 billion contribution would secure permanent membership, while a three-year appointment would not require a contribution.</li><li>US leadership: The White House says the board would help implement a 20-point plan approved by the UN Security Council in November, and reported plans place senior US figures—including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner—on the executive arm.</li><li>More invitations: Governments including Russia, Poland, Israel, China and Singapore have said they were invited, with several indicating they are assessing details before deciding whether to join.</li><li>UK engagement: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain is discussing the initiative’s terms with allies and is prepared to support Gaza reconstruction efforts tied to the board’s second-phase work.</li><li>Davos target: President Trump has said he expects countries to sign on at the Davos economic forum in Switzerland on Thursday.</li></ul><blockquote>We would have to see in terms of details what the Board of Peace becomes as it actually is established to know what sort of relationship we would have with it - U.N. spokesperson</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Morocco: Morocco’s foreign ministry said King Mohammed VI accepted President Trump’s invitation to join the Board of Peace as a founding member.
