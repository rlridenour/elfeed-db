<li>95% cotton for comfort</li>
<li>5% spandex for stretch</li>
<li>100% sleeve-length</li>
<li>Slub in the name means you can be as lazy as you want when wearing these</li>

</ul><h1>Feels Like Comfort</h1><p>Hi, it’s me, the feels-like temperature.</p>
<p>In the summer, when everything’s looking bright and sunny, I can be a Positive Pete! Or sometimes a Blazing Blanche. Or maybe even a Sticky Steve. But during this stretch of the year–these desolate, cold, windy months–I turn into a real Negative Nancy from time to time.</p>
<p>Or, am I even allowed say that? Because, after all, can I possibly be considered a “real” anything?</p>
<p>That’s the question, isn’t it?</p>
<p>In some ways, I am the closest thing you will ever experience to a ghost. I am both here and not here. You cannot touch me, yet I can hurt you somehow. I exist in a liminal space between the order of reality and the chaos of dreamland.</p>
<p>And, like some sort of spectral nuisance, I often tap on your windows or slip my fingers into the openings I can find, beckoning for you to come out or begging for you to let me in.</p>
<p>To which you, like so many victims of the hauntings seen in so many horror films, reply with a repeated, shrieking mantra: “It’s not real! It can’t do anything to me! It’s not real! It can’t do anything to me!”</p>
<p>And in some ways, I can’t. But also, I can.</p>
<p>Even when you’re inside.</p>
<p>You know exactly what I’m talking about. Your house–your beautiful, efficiently heated house–just feels <em>different</em> when there’s a chill in the air outside of those wonderfully insulated walls and modern, multi-paned windows. You can bolt the doors and draw the shades. You can crank the thermostat to an irresponsibly high number. Yet, there it lingers, that tingle, evidence that…</p>
<p><em>I’m already inside the house.</em></p>
<p>Which is to say nothing about outside. Even crossing a parking lot when I’m down double digits below zero can be painful.</p>
<p>And you might think the solution is in the outer layers. A bigger coat. A thicker sweater. A scarf. Fleece-lined pants. But really, the base layer dictates your comfort more than anything. Even just a simple long-sleeve shirt like one of these, something that adds only a thin layer of protection to three-quarters more of your arm than a normal tee–even that can go a long way.</p>
<p>Also, they’re comfy and a little stretchy. And they have pockets, which is fun.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s all I have time to say today. Unfortunately, there’s work to do. Clouds have covered the sun, and the wind is picking up, which means it’s limbo time.</p>
<p>How low can I go?</p>
