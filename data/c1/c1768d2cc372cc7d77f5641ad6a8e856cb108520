<p>Hard to say officially, but I've been primarily using Emacs for roughly a couple of decades. Maybe my eyesight isn't what it used to be, or maybe I've just been wanting a stronger visual signal as I navigate through Emacs windows. Either way, today's the day I finally did something about it…</p>
<p>I <a href="https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/116045729460859056">asked around</a> to see if a package already existed for this purpose. Folks shared a handful of great options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar">pulsar:</a> Emacs package to pulse the current line after running select functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gonewest818/dimmer.el">dimmer.el:</a> Interactively highlight the active buffer by dimming the others.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alvgaona/window-dim.el">window-dim.el:</a> A window dimmer package for Emacs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted my windows to temporarily flash when switching between them. Of these options, <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar">pulsar</a> came closest, though highlighting the current line only.</p>
<p>This is Emacs, so I should be able to get the behavior I want by throwing some elisp at the problem. With that, I give you <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/winpulse">winpulse</a>, a package to temporarily highlight focused Emacs windows.</p>

<p>This package is fresh out of the oven and likely has some edge cases I haven't yet considered. If you're still keen to check it out, it's <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/winpulse">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
