Counterpoint Research VP Ross Young today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-disputed/">cast doubt</a> on the 20th-anniversary iPhone featuring a truly all-screen design, but he still expects Apple to make some progress towards that ambitious goal over the next few iPhone generations.<br/>

In a <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1937015059806609548">post on X today</a>, Young reiterated that at least some new iPhones launching in 2026 will be equipped with under-screen Face ID. While he did not mention any specific models, he is very likely referring to the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the move to under-screen Face ID, Young said that the 2026 iPhone models will still have some visible Face ID elements, and for this reason he believes that the devices will still have a "notch" (aka the Dynamic Island), but he said that it will be "smaller" compared to the one on the iPhone 14 Pro through iPhone 16 models.<br/>
<br/>
Young's information seems to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/">conflict with a report last month</a> from <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma that said the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max would have "only a small hole cutout in the top-left corner to accommodate the front-facing camera." This wording suggested that the devices might not have a Dynamic Island at all, but Young has implied that there will still be a smaller Dynamic Island, which would still be an improvement.<br/>
<br/>
In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter over the weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman also said that Apple would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/22/iphone-all-screen-design-two-stages/">shrink the size of the Dynamic Island</a> on at least some iPhone models launching next year, so there are now multiple sources who believe that iPhone 18 models will still have a smaller Dynamic Island rather than only a front camera hole.<br/>
<br/>
Young said he is <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1937015851666006282">unsure</a> if the front camera hole will nonetheless be moved to the top-left corner of the iPhone 18 screen, or if it will remain more centered.<br/>
<br/>
Young does expect all Face ID elements to eventually be moved under the screen, but he now believes that change will not happen until 2028.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/">Ross Young</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/iphone-18-pro-smaller-dynamic-island-rumor/">iPhone 18 Pro With Under-Screen Face ID Now Rumored to Feature Smaller Dynamic Island</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pro-with-under-screen-face-id-now-rumored-to-feature-smaller-dynamic-island.2459509/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
