<p>President Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency related to Cuba and setting the stage for tariffs on countries that supply the island with oil, a move U.S. reporting says is meant to increase pressure on Cuba’s government. Multiple reports describe the measure as an effort to cut or deter fuel shipments to the island by targeting third-country suppliers rather than only direct U.S.-Cuba commerce. The announcement comes as Cuba faces chronic fuel shortages, with fuel queues and repeated power outages reported in Havana and elsewhere. Mexico said it will seek diplomatic solutions and alternatives after the order, while Venezuela condemned what it called punitive measures and urged international action to address humanitarian consequences.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/TahzIAgSmHAhMaBgIZUGWtXqHFbJcLj5Mx1oxz40-6URv2nG0sqq-rU_5b0xRokBuW38c4Jg2LsljFJZ05w3yg2WzA5gVLy7Lyu6vRmO6HdukJLzT-BKLOKGMrjNssWOTkcy1RErMeU0FmZU3jGmE9GN7grlsMF9mdHjhrKPVKPAV8Wa83TMpNLTB9yqrg8TQg0' alt='The last shipment of oil to Cuba, from Mexico, arrived on Jan. 9, an analyst said.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Mexico’s exposure: The tariff threat appeared largely directed at Mexico, which the New York Times reported has been the only country sending meaningful fuel shipments to Cuba.</li><li>Fuel time horizon: Mexico’s president said Cuba had only about 15–20 days of oil available, warning the policy could worsen conditions as blackouts persist.</li><li>Cuba’s response: Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla described the measure as amounting to “a total blockade,” according to UPI.</li><li>On-island adaptation: ABC News reported that many Cubans are trying to become more self-sufficient as U.S. pressure tightens, with experts describing the goal as spurring political change.</li><li>Regional pushback: Venezuela said it stands in solidarity with Cubans and urged “collective action by the international community” to address humanitarian consequences.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. administration: The executive order declares a national emergency tied to Cuba and lays the groundwork for tariffs on countries supplying oil, part of a strategy to increase pressure on Havana.
