<p>Jane Goodall, the revered conservationist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/01/obituaries/jane-goodall-dead.html?unlocked_article_code=1.qE8.iLG7.kgncz4-ZHKzJ&amp;smid=url-share">passed away today</a> at age 91. In her honor, we’re featuring above a <em>National Geographic</em> documentary called <em>Jane</em>. Directed by Brett Morgen, the film draws “from over 100 hours of never-before-seen footage that has been tucked away in the <em>National Geographic</em> archives for over 50 years.” The documentary offers an intimate portrait of Goodall and her&nbsp;chimpanzee research that “challenged the male-dominated scientific consensus of her time and revolutionized our understanding of the natural world.” It’s set to an orchestral score by composer Philip Glass.</p>
