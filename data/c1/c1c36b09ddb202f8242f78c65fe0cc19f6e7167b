<p id="p1">Following the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/reports-of-slide-overs-death-were-greatly-exaggerated/" rel="noopener noreferrer">comeback of Slide Over in iPadOS 26.1</a>, Apple is continuing to iterate on iPadOS 26 multitasking by restoring functionalities that had been <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-26-the-macstories-review/9/#the-transition-from-full-screen-split-view-and-slide-over" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed from the launch version of iPadOS 26.0</a> in September. Yesterday, in the third developer beta of iPadOS 26.2, the company brought back drag and drop gestures to put app windows directly in Split View and Slide Over without having to interact with additional menus. To understand how these old gestures work in the context of iPadOS 26, I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJYT0QW31mI" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video by Chris Lawley</a>:</p>

<p id="p3">As you can see, the gestures are pretty much the same ones as iPadOS 18, but the interaction is slightly different insofar as the &ldquo;pull indicator&rdquo; for Slide Over (re-introduced in iPadOS 26.1) now serves two purposes. That indicator now acts both as a signal that you can drop a window to instantly tile it as one half of a Split View, and it&rsquo;s also a drop target to enter Slide Over right away. The design is clever, if maybe a little too hard to discover&hellip;but that&rsquo;s <em>always</em> been the case with multitasking gestures that aren&rsquo;t exposed by a menu &ndash; which is exactly why Apple is now offering plenty of options in iPadOS 26 to discover different multitasking features in different menus.</p>
<p id="p4">I&rsquo;m glad to see Apple quickly iterate on iPadOS 26 by finding ways to blend the old multitasking system with the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-26-the-macstories-review/9/#ipados" rel="noopener noreferrer">platform&rsquo;s new windowing engine</a>. Based on the comments I received after publishing my iPadOS 26 review, enough people were missing the simplicity of Split View and Slide Over that I think Apple&rsquo;s doing the right thing in making all these multitasking systems coexist with one another.</p>
<p id="p5">As I argued on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/578" rel="noopener noreferrer">last week&rsquo;s episode of Connected</a>, and as Myke and Jason also elaborated on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/590" rel="noopener noreferrer">this week&rsquo;s episode of Upgrade</a>, the problem with the iPad Pro now is that we have a great foundation with iPadOS 26 and very few third-party apps that take advantage of it beyond the usual names. I suspected as much months ago, when I explained why, in a world dominated by web apps, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-ipads-sweet-solution/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the iPad&rsquo;s next problem was going to be its app ecosystem</a>. The web services I use on a daily basis (Slack, Notion, Claude, Superhuman, Todoist &ndash; the list goes on) simply don&rsquo;t make iPad apps of the same caliber as their desktop/web counterparts. So I find myself using Safari on the iPad to get my work done these days, but, for a variety of reasons and dozens of small papercuts, Safari for iPad simply isn&rsquo;t as good as Safari on the Mac.</p>
<p id="p6">Given how the third-party app ecosystem story for iPad is outside of Apple&rsquo;s control and how most companies aren&rsquo;t incentivized to make excellent native iPad apps anymore, now that multitasking has been largely &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; in iPadOS 26.2, I hope Apple turns its attention to something they <em>can</em> control: making Safari for iPad truly desktop-class and not a baby version of Safari for Mac.</p>
