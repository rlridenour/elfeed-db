<p>Taegan Goddard, writing at Political Wire, in a post that pairs perfectly <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/01/22/velocity-is-the-new-authority">with Om Malik’s re: velocity bestowing authority</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new Democratic argument isn’t about restoring guardrails. It’s
about moving fast — and using power unapologetically — to undo
what Trump has done.</p>

<p>New Jersey will inaugurate Mikie Sherrill as governor today, one
of the party’s rising stars who steamrolled Republicans in
November. She has promised to govern with urgency — leaning on
emergency powers, acting decisively, and skipping the old
incrementalism. This, she argues, is what voters now expect. She
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/mikie-sherrill-intends-to-move-fast">told The New Yorker</a> that if Democrats don’t learn to work
at Donald Trump’s pace, “we’re going to get played.”</p>

<p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href="https://www.notus.org/democrats/trump-executive-power-next-democratic-president">is even more explicit</a>: “In
order for us to correct the abuses that are happening now, we have
to act in the same capacities that Trump has given himself.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only way to counter “move fast and break things” is to move fast and fix things.</p>
