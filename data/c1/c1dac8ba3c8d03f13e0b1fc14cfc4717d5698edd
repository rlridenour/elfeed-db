         <p>In this ~24 minute video I show how to define a prefix key in Emacs
using built-in functionality. The idea is to organise our keys in an
efficient way. Using this method, we can have nested key maps as well,
meaning that the prefix key can have access to the contents of another
map which holds more key bindings. Put simply, we can have “C-z” as a
prefix, “C-z b” as a nested key maps for buffer-related commands, and
“C-z f” for file-related commands. This is a neat way to provide quick
access to our most used commands.</p>

<p>In the video I also talked about the difference between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#'</code>,
as well as what the combination of backtick and comma is about.</p>
