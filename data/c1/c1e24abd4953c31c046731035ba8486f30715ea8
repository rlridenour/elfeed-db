If you&#39;ve been using Emacs for a while, I bet you must have encountered the annoying problem that your Emacs window layout gets messed up after some operations, such as looking for a help (e.g. <code class="verbatim">C-h k</code>), or checking things in the magit status buffer.</p>

I&#39;m happy if I can just get back to the previous layout that I had before, and guess what? Emacs happens to have that capability built in – the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Window-Convenience.html">winner-mode</a> package, what a surprise!</p>
