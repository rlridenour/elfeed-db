<li>Use them as lanterns or flashlights</li>
<li>Are they available in Georgia Red: Sort of? Like, a shiny version of it?</li>
</ul><h1>What's Available</h1><p>Here’s a fact: being in the hugely discounted deal-a-day business, we basically have to take what we can get.</p>
<p>We’re constantly on the lookout for stuff that needs offloading. Maybe it was huge in Europe but flopped when it came stateside. Or maybe some big box store asked for a custom color and/or model only to go back on their order. Or maybe a brand decided to change the packaging and now they’ve got to do something with all the stuff in the old boxes.</p>
<p>Point is, if there’s something clogging up a warehouse somewhere, we want to help. And by “help,” we mean buy it for stupid cheap and sell it at a price that’ll make people say, “Wait, seriously?”</p>
<p>And sometimes, this all works out perfectly.</p>
<p>A confluence of warehouse clogs across the country leads our buyers to acquire a wide range of products, allowing us to sell something new every day for weeks on end, each offering in a different category and from an entirely different brand than that which came before it.</p>
<p>But, again, this is when it works out perfectly.</p>
<p>A lot of the times, as we said at the top, we just have to take what we can get. And a lot of times, that means acquiring a bunch of products in the same category from the same brand.</p>
<p>Hence why we’ve got another sale of Brightease lights.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: this is actually another example of things working out well. After all, we could end up with boatloads of hand cream with niche appeal or some pretty cool bladeless fans that, while steeply discounted, still cost a lot more than most would consider spending on “an impulse buy.” By comparison, stuff like this is great.</p>
<p>And besides, having more compact lights than you know what to do with isn’t a huge problem. They don’t take up much space, which means you can stash them away easily and always have a bit of illumination when you need it, whether it’s because there’s a power outage or a project to do in the basement or any number of other things we bring up literally ever time we sell a BrightEase product.</p>
<p>Or you can give them away and be the cool person in your neighborhood who’s always willing to lend a helping light.</p>
<p>Plus, these ones look pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>4 lights, 14 bucks.</p>
