<p>President Donald Trump is set to meet Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado at the White House on Thursday, US media and multiple international outlets reported. The meeting comes as Venezuela has been freeing more prisoners, amid calls to accelerate releases of political detainees. Several reports frame the visit within the fast-moving post-Maduro political transition, including accounts that US forces seized Nicolás Maduro on January 3 and that Washington announced it would be “running” Venezuela—claims that have heightened scrutiny of how Venezuela’s interim leadership is being managed.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/1j1mmSGQMRC6WzeRGVk6IH6ZjwZTT2IBtpIgE-pYTDgtPnMl58-fFE26Yw8Tk4x9o532dsG84p5L8mt5Y0th0Gfr0E1UEK1tlGvBpeOtXttWFoVH2wUUCAoH_0LQ1e4TsAV5wT77en6FWyZT42YSR06VtotZhhioOklGBkxOK2VAxrtZi3ZitD7l36HruJFtUR6S' alt='' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Nobel spotlight: BBC reported Machado won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize and had offered to share the honour with President Trump, whom the report says has long coveted the prize.</li><li>Thursday schedule: A White House official told CBS News the meeting is planned for Thursday at the White House.</li><li>Interim pressure: France 24 said the meeting comes as pressure grows on interim leaders in Caracas to speed up releases of political prisoners.</li><li>Sidelined figure: SCMP reported that Washington had previously sidelined Machado amid the post-Maduro transition described in its account.</li><li>Competing narratives: DW highlighted the political twist that Machado, after winning the prize, was later kept at arm’s length in the transition period before this renewed engagement.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House (Trump administration): US officials say President Trump will host Machado at the White House on Thursday.
