Apple is planning to bring an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> Pro-style vapor chamber to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-10-26/what-s-next-for-the-ipad-pro-iphone-17-pro-like-vapor-chamber-apple-maps-ads-mh7nq39h">latest edition</a> of his "Power On" newsletter, Gurman explained that with increasingly powerful chips, Apple is planning to bring vapor chamber cooling to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. The new feature could arrive as soon as with the next generation, which will likely feature the "M6" chip made with TSMC's 2-nanometer process. The liquid cooling system would help mitigate throttling, especially as the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; becomes more capable at handling intense workflows.<br/>

If the move to bring a vapor chamber to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; prove successful, Apple could turn its attention to bringing the technology to other passively cooled devices like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>. Apple is now seemingly operating an approximate 18-month refresh cycle for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, so next-generation model should arrive in the spring of 2027, according to Gurman. <br/>
