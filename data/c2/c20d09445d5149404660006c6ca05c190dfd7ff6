Apple is working on a next-generation version of the Vision Pro with an updated chip, and it could include a new Dual Knit Band that provides a more comfortable fit.<br/>

Updated Apple backend code found by <em>MacRumors</em> includes a reference to a "Dual Knit Band," which is not a band that exists at the current time. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> comes with a Solo Knit Band and a Dual Loop Band, but no Dual Knit Band.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the name, the new band could be a cross between Apple's two existing bands, featuring the same comfortable material as the Solo Knit Band but with a more supportive two-band fit. A text description of the Dual Knit Band suggests that there will be an upper band that spans the top of the head and another band that fits behind the head.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1b10uts/solotop_adapters_for_dual_solo_knit_band_comfort/">made custom adjustments</a> to the Vision Pro to get it to accommodate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1an2g0z/introducing_the_dual_knit_strap_system/">two Solo Knit Bands</a> for extra support at the top of the head, and those that have gone that route suggest it is much more comfortable than Apple's current Dual Loop Band.<br/>
<br/>
Back in July, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that the refreshed Vision Pro could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/apple-vision-pro-2025-features/">include a new strap</a> that would make it easier to wear the headset for long periods of time, and it looks like the rumor is accurate.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro weighs between 21.2 and 22.9 ounces, putting considerable strain on the head when it's worn for long periods of time. Some users find the weight of the device and the poor distribution of the Solo Knit Band to cause discomfort. The Dual Loop Band removes some of the weight from the face, but because it doesn't have the same knit design as the Solo Knit Band, it is less comfortable.<br/>

Apple is expected to refresh the &#36;3,499 Vision Pro before the end of 2025. It will get a faster M5 chip, but Apple doesn't plan to make any other updates to the device.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/03/vision-pro-dual-knit-band/">Upcoming Apple Vision Pro Could Get More Comfortable &#039;Dual Knit Band&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upcoming-apple-vision-pro-could-get-more-comfortable-dual-knit-band.2468322/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
