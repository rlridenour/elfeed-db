<p>Bolivia’s former president Luis Arce was detained by police in La Paz about a month after leaving office, as part of a criminal investigation into alleged embezzlement and corruption linked to his earlier role as economy minister. Prosecutors say the case centers on suspected misuse of public funds tied to the now-defunct Indigenous Peoples Development Fund (Fondioc), a state program intended to finance projects for Indigenous communities. Attorney General Roger Mariaca confirmed that Arce had been taken into custody and indicated he will likely face trial, though formal charges have not yet been detailed publicly. Allies from his Movement for Socialism (MAS) party, including former justice minister María Nela Prada, argue the arrest is politically motivated and claim he was &quot;illegally kidnapped&quot; by police, underscoring deep tensions in Bolivia’s post-election landscape.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Kde20jD9jvtBnqOjiNf82rl2PkD7i0ph3Ty5B3R_Ovl57otaVmmmU_NxUhTQOgUrbEjspI37KzrJzbLqNBT_7rHkdsxVkEB4PgEdP7wZU6Sq6UP9aVUAYEyByaROyArIHwVNW03N42Kv9PKkw8HwbEdhu1vD5oxzZcN9oIGZyhIA2ZrZ9NsA7pC4XBtcPHfvGn636T1cWD3qqMRdID75JTXC4_enV06UgzSF1U8sIeVTxfdHp5tmC1YI2_XKIEg4' alt='Former Bolivian president Luis Arce is escorted by police officers in La Paz following his detention in a corruption probe.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Fondioc background: Investigators are focusing on alleged irregularities in the Indigenous Peoples Development Fund, a body that was shuttered after earlier corruption scandals involving incomplete or poorly executed community projects.</li><li>Role as economy minister: Authorities say the suspected financial misconduct dates back to Arce’s period managing public finances in the government of former president Evo Morales, rather than his more recent presidential term.</li><li>Attorney general’s stance: Attorney General Roger Mariaca told reporters that evidence gathered so far suggests Arce should stand trial for embezzlement-related offences tied to the fund.</li><li>Political ripple effects: The arrest introduces new uncertainty into Bolivia’s already fragmented left-wing camp, where rival factions loyal to Arce and to former president Evo Morales have recently clashed over the country’s political direction.</li><li>Legal process next: Prosecutors are expected to ask a court to impose precautionary measures, such as pre-trial detention or travel restrictions, while they prepare a fuller indictment on corruption and embezzlement counts.</li></ul><blockquote>We have received information from unofficial sources that Luis Arce has been illegally kidnapped by the police - María Nela Prada Tejada</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Attorney General’s Office: Attorney General Roger Mariaca stated at a press conference that Arce’s detention follows an investigation into suspected embezzlement linked to the Indigenous Peoples Development Fund and that prosecutors intend to seek his prosecution in court.
