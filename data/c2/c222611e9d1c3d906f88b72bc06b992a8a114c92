<p>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned on Sunday that a U.S. attack on Iran would trigger a wider “regional war,” as tensions rose alongside stepped-up U.S. military deployments near Iran. President Donald Trump said the United States and Iran were in “serious discussions” and signaled he hoped for an agreement that avoids military strikes, while also keeping pressure on Tehran after Iran’s deadly crackdown on recent protests. The standoff has also spilled into Europe-related tensions, with Iranian officials describing retaliatory steps tied to EU actions over Iran’s protest response.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fgSGvP0Fi1QzQ0EA_hEiX_o2da7N68WV-lO_cClAcfHjr4MxQwdOU6Hvn74w_qj_6Re5yjMxZlyDz5h1yzp1mefZ3likMcDrFPVj3mlfjVnergxE2LmxjXJfcm0Vsq2anrwu6MRzelZDF1n1PE_nXYdkG3XDRU2Zd2r_hvlGZsmx9De3pLDx8UhftoS28KZHE8dfPrNbpG6dwxuqutTMZnFBvBTlwXdUb2zUCdTLqcSoknlvf4fpQDAOi436ncrRWKWU0cV4r_33AoVmjQ' alt='Iranian lawmakers chant slogans while wearing Revolutionary Guard uniforms during a parliament session in Tehran, Feb. 1, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Naval posture: Several outlets reported the U.S. moved major naval assets toward the region, including an aircraft carrier group, as Washington increased pressure during the flare-up.</li><li>Exercise plans: Iran is due to begin a live-fire naval exercise in a key shipping route, a step that can raise risks of miscalculation during heightened alerts.</li><li>EU retaliation: Iran’s parliamentary speaker said Tehran would treat all EU militaries as “terrorist” groups, describing it as a retaliatory move after EU action against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.</li><li>Talks signals: Iranian officials said arrangements for negotiations were underway and Tehran was open to “fair” talks that do not restrict its defensive capabilities.</li><li>Protest framing: Khamenei described the late-December unrest as akin to a “coup” and cited attacks on police and state sites in his characterization of the protests.</li></ul><blockquote>We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them. - Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: He warned that if the U.S. attacks Iran, the conflict would spread into a regional war, while portraying Iran as not seeking to start a war.
