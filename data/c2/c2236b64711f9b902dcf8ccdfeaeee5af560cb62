<p>This is not a super useful fact but I thought it was cool and didn&rsquo;t know it
before: you can run <code>tty</code> to get the TTY device for your current terminal
session.</p>
<p>For example, if I run <code>tty</code> and get <code>/dev/pts/0</code>, I can then go to a
different terminal tab, run <code>echo blah &gt; /dev/pts/0</code>, and than <code>blah</code> will show
up in the original terminal tab.</p>
