<p>Iranian authorities unveiled a new mural on a giant billboard in Tehran warning the United States against launching a military strike, as tensions rise between the two countries. The artwork depicts a U.S. aircraft carrier amid explosions and casualties, paired with the message: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind”. The display comes as U.S. naval forces, including the USS Abraham Lincoln and accompanying warships, move toward the region after President Donald Trump said ships were being repositioned “just in case” he decides to take action. Iranian officials have also signaled heightened military readiness in response.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RAaPnOQMX9keqMUujihw6O6b0PzCzH6neYOd1amw4WJ1ijQTAmG_tRpnSqyw0QvghunH_d7jCxxMKNGK2PEQyrCYSLLjlz6vCISe9YWf4MGjDG-BxwVSw8eYG5D4wxrcMFiY9mZYrXOg6eCcnXlzdza4Vd6q2dPDVg7KXf1_chI_6gtYN4kw1tB0cVLvRn8Y78AJjfVmSdVSCSypi0rCRsHmj3a5SV1JeVOj35qmRkNgn3G-xi4_jMsyymmtW-3p3CL8va-Dkg' alt='A photo distributed with reporting on rising U.S.-Iran tensions and U.S. force movements in the region.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Enghelab Square: The billboard was unveiled in central Tehran’s Enghelab Square on Sunday, making it a highly visible public message aimed at U.S. decision-makers and the wider international audience.</li><li>Visual symbolism: Several outlets described the mural’s blood imagery, including a trail in the water that resembles U.S. flag stripes, underscoring its warning-of-retaliation theme.</li><li>Protest crackdown: The Hindu linked the current spike in tensions to Iran’s crackdown on nationwide protests that it said left thousands dead and tens of thousands arrested.</li><li>Iran readiness: Euronews reported Iranian authorities said their forces were “more ready than ever, finger on the trigger,” framing the billboard as part of a broader deterrence message.</li><li>Pressure narrative: Firstpost framed the U.S. moves as increased military pressure from President Trump, with Iran using the mural to warn against intervention.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iranian authorities: Iran presented the mural as a direct warning that a U.S. strike would bring retaliation, pairing the image with a proverb-like threat message.
