<p>Russia carried out a large overnight barrage of drones and missiles across Ukraine, heavily hitting energy and transport infrastructure just as US-mediated talks on a possible peace framework wrapped up in Florida. Ukraine’s air force reported that hundreds of Shahed-type attack drones and dozens of missiles were launched, triggering air alerts nationwide as the country marked Armed Forces Day. Power facilities in at least eight regions were damaged, prompting emergency cuts to electricity production at nuclear plants and leaving tens of thousands of customers without heat or water in some southern areas. In the central industrial city of Kremenchuk, a “massive” combined strike on civilian infrastructure knocked out power and water supplies, though local authorities reported no deaths in the city. Even as the attacks continued, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said discussions with a US delegation on a possible peace deal were “substantive,” underscoring that diplomacy and intense fighting are unfolding in parallel.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qyxRvDxc1D1mEE1yN1SBx3S6e9LgqyweuPbdtja5bRcLqsXejU_lbWVVYA5yRsbdpTN8qCnn8MqVVVqwJTXywVjUiD7PpIXVTYCuK5hYrXBM' alt='Residents stand near a damaged building in Ukraine’s Dnipro region after a Russian missile and drone strike.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of barrage: Ukraine’s air force said Russia used 653 drones and 51 missiles over a two‑day period of attacks that included the latest overnight strike, describing one of the largest air operations in recent months.</li><li>Ukrainian air defenses: Ukrainian forces reported shooting down or neutralizing 585 of the drones and 30 of the missiles, limiting physical damage despite the volume of incoming weapons.</li><li>Energy system strain: Ukraine’s three operating nuclear power plants reduced output as fighting intensified around the grid, while conventional power and heat facilities were struck in regions including Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, and Dnipropetrovsk.</li><li>Local utility disruptions: In Odesa region, authorities said about 9,500 customers temporarily lacked heating and some 34,000 had no water supply, with port facilities switching to generators while repair crews worked where conditions allowed.</li><li>Railway infrastructure hit: A railway hub near Kyiv, including a depot and several carriages, was damaged in the overnight strikes, adding pressure on a transport network that is crucial for both civilian mobility and military logistics.</li></ul><blockquote>Russia continues to disregard any peace efforts and instead strikes critical civilian infrastructure, including our energy system and railways - Andrii Sybiha, Ukrainian foreign minister</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Ukraine: Ukrainian officials said Russia was deliberately targeting power plants and railway hubs as winter sets in and argued that delays in strengthening Ukraine’s defenses only encourage further strikes on civilian infrastructure.
