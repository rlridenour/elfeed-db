<p>The <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">counsel</a> family of Emacs search commands are great for searching the filesystem. More specifically, <em>counsel-rg</em>, <em>counsel-ag</em>, and <em>counsel-pt</em>, which use the popular <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">silver searcher</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher">platinum searcher</a> utilities.</p>
<p>counsel-rg is my default searcher. It returns results quickly, with live updates as I tweak the search query.</p>
<p>Up until recently, my queries typically matched text in files only. This works great, but every so often I wished I could amend the query to include (or exclude) results matching specific file <em>names</em>. Turns out, you can prepend the search query with additional switches using the &quot;–&quot; separator.</p>
<p>The switches are usually utility-specific, but if we wanted to keep results from file names matching a glob, we can prepend the ripgrep query with something like <em>&quot;–glob Make* –&quot;</em> or the shorter version <em>&quot;-g Make* –&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>rg: -g Make* – install</p>
