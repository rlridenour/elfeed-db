  <p>Behind a stunning, game-tying swat from Miguel Rojas in the top of
the ninth, a first-of-its-kind, go-ahead blast from Will Smith in
the top of the 11th and the absurd extra work World Series MVP
Yoshinobu Yamamoto provided on zero days’ rest, the Dodgers broke
Toronto hearts with their comeback 5-4 victory in a game that
merited its own month on the MLB calendar.</p>

<p>The Dodgers are MLB’s first repeat champs since the 1998-2000
Yankees, and the four-hour, seven-minute, extra-innings affair it
took to decide that was a fitting end to a true Fall Classic in
which these two clubs exhausted each other — not just in the
18-inning epic at Dodger Stadium in Game 3 but throughout a Series
in which they both had to empty the tank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When a series goes to game 7, every fan hopes it’s a good game. But this was a <em>great</em> game — as good as baseball gets. Great pitching, clutch hitting, and some amazing fielding plays. Simply riveting to watch. The Blue Jays came within an inch or two of winning the Series <a href="https://x.com/bdubsports_/status/1984828236715675702">on this play</a> in the bottom of the 9th (and I think they would’ve won on that play if Kiner-Falefa had run through home plate rather than inexplicably sliding).</p>
