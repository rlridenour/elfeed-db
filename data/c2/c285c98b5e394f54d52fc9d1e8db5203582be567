<div>    <p>Emacs <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Window">windows</a> easily get unbalanced.</p>    <p>After calling <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Split-Window.html">split-window-right</a> twice, there are three windows. Rather than being all the same size, two of them take up a quarter of the frame each, and the third is half as big as the frame.</p>    <p><img src="images/balance-emacs-windows/three-windows.png" alt="Three windows, of different sizes." /></p>    <p>Or, if there are already three equally-sized windows, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Change-Window.html#index-delete_002dwindow">closing one window</a> leaves one of the remaining windows twice as big as the other.</p>    <p><img src="images/balance-emacs-windows/two-windows.png" alt="Two windows, of different sizes." /></p>    <p>To me, that's unbalanced.</p>    <p>I want the windows to be the same size. Whether I got to two windows by starting at one and opening another, or starting at three and closing one, those two windows should have the same layout.</p>    <p><img src="images/balance-emacs-windows/balanced-windows.png" alt="Two balanced windows." /></p>    <p>So I'd manually balance them. Every time I opened or closed a window, I'd press <code>C-x +</code> to run <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Change-Window.html#index-balance_002dwindows"><code>#'balance-windows</code></a>. Then, all the windows would be the same size, no matter if I'd just opened or closed one.</p>    <p><img src="images/balance-emacs-windows/three-balanced-windows.png" alt="Three balanced windows." /></p>    <p>Then I realized that no matter how many windows are open, I want them to be the same size. This is manual work! Too much manual work. Why doesn't Emacs do that for me?</p>    <p>I wrote some code. Now it does.</p>    <code class="code-emacs-lisp">        <pre>(seq-doseq (fn (list #'split-window #'delete-window))  (advice-add fn              :after              #'(lambda (&amp;rest args) (balance-windows))))</pre></code>    <p>This is a straightforward use of Emacs's powerful <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">advice</a> functionality. Every time the window configuration is changed, we call the function <code>balance windows</code>, to keep all the windows equally sized.</p>    <p>And then everything is in balance.</p></div><div>    <h2><strong>UPDATE</strong></h2>    <div>        <p>A kind stranger wrote in about the variable <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Recombining-Windows.html#index-window_002dcombination_002dresize"><code>window-combination-resize</code></a>.</p>        <figure>            <blockquote>                <p>If this variable is t, splitting a window tries to get the space                    proportionally from all windows in the same combination.</p>            </blockquote>        </figure>        <p>I think this is relatively confusing, but it does seem to do what we want. So the fix code is updated to:</p>        <code class="code-emacs-lisp">            <pre>(setf window-combination-resize t)</pre></code>        <p>So things are still in balance, but lighter. If confusing.</p>    </div></div>
