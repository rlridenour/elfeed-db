Apple could debut LOFIC camera sensor technology in its 2027 iPhone lineup, according to new information coming out of Korea. The tech would allow iPhones to capture photos with far more detail in both bright and dark areas of the same shot without losing information in either.<br/>

LOFIC, or Lateral Overflow Integration Capacitor, is a next-generation imaging technology that enables each pixel to store varying amounts of light based on scene brightness. This allows a sensor to capture detail in both bright highlights and dark shadows within a single frame, potentially reaching up to 20 stops of dynamic range – comparable to high-end cinema cameras and approaching the range of human vision.<br/>

According to the account name "<a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=224054892783&navType=by">yeux1122</a>" on the Korean-langauge Naver blog, Chinese manufacturers including Honor, Xiaomi, and Huawei plan to adopt LOFIC technology in their 2026 flagship smartphones using new Sony sensors, while OPPO and Vivo are also developing LOFIC-equipped models for release next year. Apple's adoption will reportedly follow in 2027.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first detailed LOFIC in an image sensor patent filed in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/02/apple-researching-groundbreaking-image-sensor/">July</a>, describing a stacked sensor design with a dedicated light-capture layer and a processing layer that handles real-time noise reduction. Apple has reportedly already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/apple-developing-its-own-image-sensor/">developed a working prototype</a> and may be testing it in developmental hardware. <br/>
<br/>
Apple currently uses sensors made by Sony across the iPhone lineup. Those sensors also use a two-layer design, but Apple's proposed version includes several innovative features and takes up less space. Based on the adoption roadmap in today's report, Apple could be planning to debut its custom image sensor in the 20th anniversary iPhone. Apple is reportedly considering a radical redesign for the anniversary model that could feature a completely bezel-less display that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/20th-anniversary-iphone-no-visible-frame-bezels/">curves around all four edges of the device</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/20th-anniversary-iphone/">20th-Anniversary iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/">Naver</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/27/apple-custom-image-sensor-20th-anniversary-iphone/">Apple&#039;s Custom Image Sensor Could Debut in 20th Anniversary iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-custom-image-sensor-could-debut-in-20th-anniversary-iphone.2469895/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
