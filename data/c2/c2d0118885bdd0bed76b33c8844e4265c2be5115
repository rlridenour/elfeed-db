<p>A federal judge in Florida has authorized the US Justice Department to release grand jury transcripts from its mid-2000s sex-crimes investigation of financier Jeffrey Epstein and related proceedings involving Ghislaine Maxwell, finding that a new federal statute overrides traditional secrecy rules. Judge Rodney Smith ruled that the recently enacted Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law last month by President Trump, requires public disclosure of government records connected to Epstein and therefore supersedes standard grand jury confidentiality protections. The transcripts concern an earlier Florida probe that ended with Epstein pleading guilty in 2008 to a state charge rather than facing federal sex-trafficking charges, as well as material from later cases tied to Maxwell. The Justice Department is also asking courts to unseal grand jury records from Epstein’s New York case and Maxwell’s prosecution, and the newly released material could provide fresh insight into how authorities previously handled allegations involving powerful associates.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/unMhOHmR1GEYUBMMSssGGXwB10NeE5CdlCmrjyrM5fWQb2JopBcVNDsfDbA99NcMD971lIgeZpkBuacx_qeJ1qY_tKSE4VP63p11nQnK_KTRB0TymJcAAfS481XxvyzFEtVzTMuVbC3Zhmun_HFEpSoL9UctQXOxKMMdZ8ipmt1CET8gfHLEP8G31giWUqhCu6QBo4zobcC4zF3FrhFVz2mSeiki4GBFC7lUcUZDXYjMoJ7k3caXaNaaPYlX3Ib0tTE9iseGjT9fxRy8KA' alt='Jeffrey Epstein appears in a Florida courtroom in 2008, during earlier legal proceedings that are now under renewed scrutiny.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Role of new law: Judge Smith concluded that Congress intended the Epstein Files Transparency Act to take precedence over the long-standing federal rule that generally keeps grand jury proceedings secret, effectively creating a specific exception for Epstein-related records.</li><li>Justice Department request: The Justice Department had previously tried and failed to obtain court permission to unseal the Florida grand jury material, but renewed its request after the transparency law came into force.</li><li>Scope of transcripts: The materials cover an abandoned federal investigation in Florida into Epstein’s abuse of underage girls, during which no federal charges were ultimately brought despite a substantial fact-gathering effort.</li><li>Potential political relevance: Reporting notes that the transcripts may shed light on Epstein’s contacts with wealthy and influential figures, including current and former political leaders, which has fueled public interest in full disclosure.</li><li>Future unsealing efforts: Officials are now seeking comparable releases of grand jury records from Epstein’s later New York federal case and from the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell, aiming to create a more complete public archive.</li></ul><blockquote>A federal judge on Friday gave the Justice Department permission to release transcripts of a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse of underage girls in Florida – a case that ultimately ended without any federal charges being filed against the millionaire sex offender. - The Globe and Mail reporting</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US District Court (Judge Rodney Smith): The court’s view is that the Epstein Files Transparency Act reflects a clear legislative decision to prioritize public access to Epstein-related records over the normal presumption of grand jury secrecy..
