<p>When I wrote last week about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2026/01/ios_26_adoption_rate_is_not_bizarrely_low">the false narrative that iOS 26 is seeing bizarrely low adoption rates</a> compared to previous years, I neglected one source: Apple itself. Apple’s Developer site publishes a page with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/">iOS and iPadOS usage for devices that “transacted on the App Store”</a>.</p>

<p>The hitch is that they only seem to update those numbers twice a year — once right around now, and once again right before WWDC. As of today, those numbers are still from 4 June 2025. Last year, going from the Internet Archive, the numbers were still from iOS 17 (June 2024) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250123123759/https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/">on 23 January</a> last year, but were updated for iOS 18 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250125013020/https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/">on 24 January</a>. Here are those iOS 18 numbers from one year ago this week.</p>

<p>iPhones released in the previous four years:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS 18: 76%</li>
<li>iOS 17: 19%</li>
<li>iOS &lt; 17: 5%</li>
</ul>

<p>All iPhones:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS 18: 68%</li>
<li>iOS 17: 19%</li>
<li>iOS &lt; 17: 13%</li>
</ul>

<p>iPads released in the previous four years:</p>

<ul>
<li>iPadOS 18: 63%</li>
<li>iPadOS 17: 27%</li>
<li>iPadOS &lt; 17: 10%</li>
</ul>

<p>All iPads:</p>

<ul>
<li>iPadOS 18: 53%</li>
<li>iPadOS 17: 28%</li>
<li>iPadOS &lt; 17: 19%</li>
</ul>

<p>(Apple itself manages to present these statistics without ever using the plurals <em>iPhones</em> or <em>iPads</em>, instead referring only to “devices”.)</p>

<p>A year prior in early 2024, Apple updated the numbers at some point between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240123183314/https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/">23 January</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240206013405/https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/">6 February</a>. I presume, or at least hope, that they’ll update these numbers for iOS 26 any day now.</p>
