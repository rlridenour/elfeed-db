<p>The app in question, Instacar, is not available in the US App Store, but multiple people in the EU have confirmed this warning on its App Store page is real:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This app does not support the App Store’s private and secure
payment system. It uses external purchases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The warning is decorated with a big red “!” icon. <strong>Update:</strong> You can see the warning, minus the red warning icon, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/hu/app/instacar/id6443874337">on the web version of the Hungarian App Store</a>.</p>

<p>The uncompetitive nature of the App Store — I’m using <em>un</em>competitive rather than <em>anti</em>competitive just to give Apple the benefit of the doubt here — has left at least some top Apple executives hopelessly naive about the state of online payments. It’s like when they still blather on about software being sold on discs inside boxes in physical retail stores. That <em>was</em> true. It <em>was</em> once relevant. It no longer is and hasn’t been for over a decade.</p>

<p>Same with payments. Online payments through, say, Stripe — which zillions of companies use — are completely private and secure today. Amazon payments are completely private and secure. I’m sure there remain sketchy corners of the Internet, but for the most part, all mainstream online payments today are private and secure. Apple’s IAP system has numerous advantages and user-centric features. (If Apple were actively competing, it would have many more.) But the fact that it’s “private and secure” is no longer distinguishing at all.</p>
