<p><a href="https://ultralisp.org/">Ultralisp.org</a> has a great new search system. It indexes the docstrings of all the Ultralisp projects, and as a result it is very easy to search for specific functionality and get useful results. For example, I wanted to see what projects have base64-related functions, and now it&rsquo;s just <a href="https://ultralisp.org/search/?query=base64">a simple search away</a>. I highly recommend it.</p>
