<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593298909">What an Owl Knows</a> by Jennifer Ackerman 📚</p>
<p>This was a slow read. I&rsquo;m not always in the mood to &ldquo;read&rdquo; the Discovery Channel. Ackerman is a generous writer. She obvioulsy loves owls, as do I, and her book takes us all around the world learning about them - as well the people who work with them.</p>
