<p>I try and keep a simple colour scheme definition for my web site using some CSS variables:</p>
<figure class="emacs-img"><img src="https://emacs.dyerdwelling.family/ox-hugo/20230623095629-emacs--Toggle-Colours-CSS.jpg">
</figure>

<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">--theme-fg: #2b2d3a;
--theme-bg: #fffbef;
--theme-alt: #ffa500;
</code></pre><p><code>rainbow-mode</code> of course helps to show the colours in situ, but sometimes if I am changing the colour scheme I use <code>list-colors-display</code> and then copy and paste the hex value.  But should I use the name instead?, it is tempting as the colour would be very apparent and readable in the CSS file but then it is difficult to just incrementally tweak a hex value to get the colours to look just right.  I also like to use orange, well I always seem to revert back to it but I can never remember the hex value.</p>
<p>There is an in-built function in emacs which can help me out with all this called <code>css-cycle-color-format</code> and is bound to C-c C-f</p>
<p>With the point over the colour, potentially three different CSS color formats are cycled, by name (if possible), hexadecimal, and rgb()/rgba().</p>
<p>For example I could cycle through orange as thus:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">--theme-alt: orange;
--theme-alt: #ffa500;
--theme-alt: rgb(255, 165, 0);
--theme-alt: orange;
</code></pre><p>What about a colour / hex value in a non CSS file I hear you say, well although <code>css-cycle-color-format</code> is bound to <code>css-mode-map</code> it can be called for other files and in other modes.  For example in <code>init.el</code> calling <code>css-cycle-color-format</code> seems to work so I guess it could just be rebound to any <code>mode-map</code> as desired.</p>
<p>Also if you have a CSS file with a profusion of hex colour values the <code>css-cycle-color-format</code> command could find the name value for you, for example as a test, putting in a colour that is obviously red :</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">--theme-alt: #ff0000;
</code></pre><p>cycles to:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">--theme-alt: red;
</code></pre>
