Backtrack uses the GPS on your Apple Watch to create a virtual breadcrumb trail of your route so you don't have to worry about keeping track of where you're going. According to Apple, Backtrack is designed to be used in remote settings, away from familiar places like your home or workplace, and outside densely populated areas without Wi-Fi, but there's nothing stopping you from using it anywhere you need it. <br/>
<br/>
The following steps show you how to use the feature. Note that Backtrack doesn't account for external conditions, such as changes in elevation or objects in the environment.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Compass</strong> app on your Apple Watch.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>Backtrack button</strong> in the bottom-right of the screen, then tap Record Path to begin recording your route.<br/>

<li>When you're ready to retrace your steps, tap the now-highlighted<strong> Backtrack button</strong> in the bottom-right of the screen, then tap <strong>Retrace Steps</strong>. </li><br/>
<li>The path back to the location where you first tapped the Backtrack button will appear on the screen, while the initial location appears as a white dot at the beginning of the path. Follow the path back to return to where you first turned on Backtrack.<br/>
