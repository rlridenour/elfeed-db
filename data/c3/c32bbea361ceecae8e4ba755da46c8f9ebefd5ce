Christie's is preparing to auction off the original partnership contract that created the Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, valuing it in the region of &#36;2-4 million.  <br/>

The original three-page document served as the contract among Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ron Wayne. The agreement established initial shares at 45% for Jobs, 45% for Wozniak, and 10% for Wayne.<br/>
<br/>
Additional papers documenting Wayne's withdrawal as a partner just 12 days after the company was formed are also included in the auction package. Wayne initially received &#36;800 for his 10% share of the company, and later received an additional &#36;1,500 payment.<br/>
<br/>
Wayne later stated he withdrew because he knew the venture would be a "roller coaster" and that the high-stakes ride was not for him. <br/>
<br/>
If Wayne's original 10% stake had somehow remained untouched, it would be worth about &#36;409 billion today based on Apple's &#36;4 trillion valuation. That's only a playful comparison, mind, since decades of stock splits, new share issuances, and structural changes mean that early 10% slice has no realistic connection to Apple's modern share count!<br/>
<br/>
Christie's will offer the founding contract and Wayne's withdrawal agreement as a single lot on January 23, 2026.<br/>

In the early 1990s, Wayne sold the physical copy of the founding contract for &#36;500. Apple's founding corporate papers were last sold at auction by Sotheby's in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2011/12/13/apple-founding-documents-sell-for-nearly-1-6-million/">December 2011</a>. That lot also included Wayne's withdrawal, and it was sold to a private collector for nearly &#36;1.6 million.<br/>
