<h2>AirPods Live Translation in EU</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/11/AirPods-Live-Translation.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025657" /><br/>
iOS 26.2 makes Live Translation on AirPods <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/newsroom/2025/11/live-translation-on-airpods-expands-to-the-eu/">available in the EU</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Live Translation allows you to understand someone who is speaking a different language than you. For example, if you speak English, and someone is speaking to you in French, Siri can tell you what they are saying in English through your AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
The feature works best when both participants in a conversation are using Live Translation on AirPods. If you are talking with someone who is not wearing AirPods, you can display a live transcription in the other person's language on your iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
Live Translation is available on the AirPods Pro 3, AirPods Pro 2, and higher-end AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation. The feature launched in the U.S. and select other countries with iOS 26, but it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/11/airpods-live-translation-eu-restricted/">not available in the EU</a> until iOS 26.2, as Apple said it needed additional time to ensure compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-26-use-live-translation-with-airpods/">iOS 26: Use Live Translation With AirPods</a></li></ul><br/>
In addition to compatible AirPods, users need an iPhone 15 Pro or newer with Apple Intelligence turned on and Apple's Translate app installed.<br/>
<br/>
As of iOS 26.1, Live Translation on AirPods supports the following languages:<ul><br/>
  <li>English (U.S.)</li><br/>
  <li>English (U.K.)</li><br/>
  <li>French (France)</li><br/>
