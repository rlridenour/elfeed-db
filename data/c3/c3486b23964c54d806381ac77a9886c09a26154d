<p>President Trump signed legislation late on November 12 to end a 43-day federal government shutdown, capping a political standoff that had left hundreds of thousands of workers furloughed and disrupted services nationwide. The House approved the funding package earlier that evening by a largely party-line vote of 222–209 after the Senate cleared the measure, and the bill restores pay, food assistance and air-traffic control operations while extending funding through January 30. Economists and analysts warned the shutdown already reduced economic growth and created backlogs that could take days or weeks to clear.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/cJCDfLepAs_INEln_OuBAFWWOHOcy4gZDWc0irF_6i75uVGQO6w-nqUy5MGTEYqJGZbdt167k-M_5l5svHWiE1Zhp33JCRAzSZF2GMe2rdkC' alt='President Donald Trump poses for a photo with senators after signing the funding bill to end the shutdown, White House, November 12 — Reuters' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Restart timeline: Agencies warned that payroll systems and permit backlogs mean normal services may take days to more than a week to resume, slowing payments and grant disbursements</li><li>Political fallout: Several Democrats expressed fury at colleagues who broke ranks while Republicans used their House majority to pass the bill, deepening intra-party tensions ahead of a planned December vote on healthcare subsidies</li><li>Travel disruption: Officials cautioned that flight cancellations and air-traffic staffing shortfalls could persist for days, with some analysts expecting issues to linger into the Thanksgiving travel period</li><li>Fiscal effect: Critics noted the short-term funding patch keeps the government on a fiscal path that analysts say adds roughly $1.8 trillion a year to long-term obligations, raising debt concerns voiced in the debate</li><li>Protected programs: The package contains three year-long funding provisions for veterans&#x27; programs, certain USDA/FDA activities and legislative branch operations, offering temporary stability for those services</li></ul><blockquote>Today we’re sending a clear message that we will never give in to extortion - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He framed the bill as a stand against political extortion and urged changes to Senate rules to avoid future repeats.
