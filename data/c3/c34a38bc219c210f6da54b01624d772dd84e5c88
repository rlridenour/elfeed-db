<p>In Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he views the US-drafted peace roadmap for Ukraine as a potential &quot;basis&quot; for future negotiations but warned that Russia will continue fighting unless Ukrainian forces pull back from territories Moscow claims as its own. He reiterated that Russia would halt combat operations only if Kyiv withdraws from areas in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that Russia says it has incorporated, and otherwise would seek to seize them &quot;by military means&quot;. Putin also argued that it is &quot;legally impossible&quot; for Moscow to sign a peace agreement with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s government, which the Kremlin now describes as illegitimate because national elections were not held, a characterization Ukraine rejects. The comments come as Washington circulates a revised peace plan after European and Ukrainian criticism of an earlier draft and prepares for talks with both Moscow and Kyiv in an effort to end nearly four years of full-scale war.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DIuOkoic5auHIBQyPyIbuO5X0I4B9vEs2vpQbba8RJ_TbSuVw-SKuPrL8Ga46ScnEAh9MyfEd-PWTulmuBeewQNVAtbSpmE8eF7H7SvB9-aa' alt='Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks to journalists in Bishkek after a CSTO summit, where he commented on a US-drafted Ukraine peace plan.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>US mediation role: The latest American proposal reportedly shortens an earlier draft to about 20 points, with US negotiator Steve Witkoff expected in Moscow for further discussions on the document.</li><li>Earlier US draft: Washington’s initial plan, which drew criticism from Kyiv and European capitals, had envisaged Ukrainian withdrawal from parts of Donetsk and de facto US recognition of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea as Russian-controlled.</li><li>NATO and neutrality: Russia’s foreign ministry reiterated that potential NATO membership for Ukraine remains unacceptable for Moscow, blaming the alliance for seeking to pull Kyiv into its structures and thereby threaten Russian security.</li><li>CSTO summit setting: Putin’s remarks were delivered after a summit of the Collective Security Treaty Organization in Bishkek, where Russia met with several allied post-Soviet states under the regional defense bloc’s umbrella.</li><li>Ukrainian stance: Ukrainian officials and statements cited in coverage insist that Kyiv will not accept any peace formula that involves surrendering internationally recognized Ukrainian territory or legitimizing Russia’s occupation.</li></ul><blockquote>If Ukrainian forces leave the territories they hold, then we will stop combat operations - Vladimir Putin</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Russian government: Putin says Russia regards the US peace proposal &quot;positively on the whole&quot; as a possible basis for future agreements, but insists Ukraine must withdraw from territories claimed by Moscow and that he is prepared to enforce this militarily if Kyiv refuses.
