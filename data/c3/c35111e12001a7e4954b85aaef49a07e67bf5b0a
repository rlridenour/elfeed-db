Russia has blocked Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> video calling app in an ongoing effort to eliminate private communication methods, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/russia-imposes-restrictions-apples-facetime-app-agencies-say-2025-12-04/">Reuters</a></em>. Russia claims &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; is being used for criminal activity, and that blocking the app is a legitimate law enforcement measure. Social network Snapchat and multiplayer gaming platform Roblox were also banned this week.<br/>

Multiple other apps and services have been blocked in Russia previously. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, and LinkedIn are unavailable and can't be accessed without a VPN. Russia throttles YouTube heavily to make it almost unusable, and since 2022, TikTok has had a Russia-only feed that does not include content from other countries.<br/>
<br/>
Viber and Signal are banned in the country, and Russians are not able to make calls through WhatsApp or Telegram as of earlier this year. Messaging on those apps is also restricted.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement to <em>Reuters</em>, Russia's media regulator Roskomnadzor said the following:<br/>
<blockquote>According to law enforcement agencies, FaceTime is being used to organise and carry out terrorist attacks in the country, recruit perpetrators, and commit fraud and other crimes against Russian citizens.</blockquote><br/>
&zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; is now restricted nationwide, and has likely been blocked at the network level, so it may still be accessible through a VPN. Moscow residents are seeing a "User unavailable" message when attempting to use &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj;, which is the error displayed when a &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; call is unable to connect. The app still opens and activates, so Apple hasn't removed it.<br/>
<br/>
Russia claims that the app is used for coordinating illegal activity, with no option for the Federal Security Service (FSB) to monitor calls. Apple has declined to allow the FSB to access &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; traffic, and the company has not budged on end-to-end encryption.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; likely wasn't banned earlier because Russia initially focused on more widely used apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. When voice and video calling were banned in those apps, Russians transitioned to &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; as an alternative, making it a government target.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/russia/">Russia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/04/russia-blocks-facetime/">Russia Blocks Apple&#039;s FaceTime Amid Crackdown on Encrypted Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/russia-blocks-apples-facetime-amid-crackdown-on-encrypted-apps.2474233/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
