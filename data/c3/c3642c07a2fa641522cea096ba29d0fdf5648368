OpenAI today introduced <a href="https://chatgpt.com/atlas">ChatGPT Atlas</a>, a dedicated AI browser that includes ChatGPT integration. OpenAI says that the browser was designed around the question "What if you could chat with your web browser?"<br/>
<br/>

There is a dedicated "Ask ChatGPT" sidebar, allowing users to ask the chatbot questions directly from the browser without having to go to the ChatGPT website or app. ChatGPT will be able to do things like provide page summaries, compare products, answer questions about content on a website, edit and check code, and more, because it can see what the user is looking at. Browser memory is included for personalization purposes, and Atlas will learn more about the user over time.<br/>
<br/>
For searches, the browser opens with a ChatGPT-based response, but there are quick access tabs to get to traditional search results, images, and other options. The ChatGPT sidebar is meant to stay open while browsing takes place, providing a browsing companion.<br/>
<br/>
The new browser includes OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/">Operator AI agent</a> that can take actions and complete web-based tasks like booking restaurant reservations, ordering groceries, creating purchase lists from online recipes, and filling out online forms. There is a "Cursor Chat" tool for editing writing inline in the browser.<br/>
<br/>
All of the standard browser features are also included, like tabs, bookmarks, history, and password integration. The design is simple and familiar, featuring a standard search window like Safari or Chrome.<br/>
<br/>
ChatGPT Atlas is launching on the Mac to begin with, and versions for iOS, Android, and Windows will be coming in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas browser will compete with Apple's Safari browser and Google's Chrome browser. Safari does not have AI integration as of yet, but Chrome does. With OpenAI, Google, and also Perplexity offering AI browsers, Apple may need to integrate <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and other AI tools into Safari in the future to keep up with the competition.<br/>
<br/>
ChatGPT Atlas is available on macOS starting today, but agent mode is only available to Plus and Pro users at the current time. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/21/chatgpt-atlas-browser/">OpenAI Launches &#039;ChatGPT Atlas&#039; Browser to Compete with Safari and Chrome</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openai-launches-chatgpt-atlas-browser-to-compete-with-safari-and-chrome.2469534/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
