So I&#39;m trying to improve my English speaking skill by shadowing while watching TV episodes. The workflow before was to loop over video clips using mpv:</p>
<ol>
<li>hit <code class="verbatim">l</code> to mark the start of the loop</li>
<li>play the video and wait for it to be at the end of the loop</li>
<li>hit <code class="verbatim">l</code> again to mark the end</li>
</ol>
<p>Then mpv will loop over the clip, it basically works, but it&#39;s a bit hard and tedious to set the start and end precisely.</p>
