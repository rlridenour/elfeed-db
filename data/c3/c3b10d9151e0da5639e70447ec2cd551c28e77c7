The Silver option displays an even steeper discount, but we haven't seen this model in stock in weeks, so the current &#36;150 discount offered for the other colors is your best bet. This is still a great low price on the M2 MacBook Air, which should be a perfect laptop for anyone looking to accomplish day-to-day tasks like checking email and streaming video.<br/>
