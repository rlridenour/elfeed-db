<p>A series of drone strikes on the town of Kalogi in Sudan’s South Kordofan state hit a kindergarten, a hospital and then rescuers, killing large numbers of civilians including many young children, according to local officials and medical and rights groups. A local administrator who communicated via satellite internet blamed the attacks on the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group and an allied Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North faction that controls much of the surrounding region. Casualty estimates vary, with Sudan’s foreign ministry, aligned with the army, reporting 79 deaths including 43 children, while a doctors’ group cited 50 killed with 33 of them children, and UNICEF confirming that more than 10 children aged five to seven were among the dead. The strikes come as the RSF advances east after capturing El-Fasher, prompting UN human rights officials to warn of a new wave of atrocities and UNICEF to denounce the killing of children at school as a grave violation of their rights and to urge all sides to halt attacks and allow humanitarian access.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/e2Wh91tDQXClpi66qV19SGkc4Swi-O8w74toDfwbQ-izEL9Z7EgPeFRMliaLGB64_yygHv9vvqubWfhv-klnTBEV6RUBypfp1QjiY3efECNp' alt='Sudanese families displaced from El Fasher gather at a transit camp in eastern Chad as conflict between the RSF and Sudanese army continues.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Pattern of attacks: Local officials say three separate drone strikes hit first the kindergarten, then the hospital, and then people who had rushed to rescue children from the initial blast.</li><li>Targeting medics: Sudan Doctors’ Network and Emergency Lawyers reported that paramedics and survivors at the scene came under a second unexpected strike while providing treatment, worsening casualties among those helping the wounded.</li><li>Communication hurdles: Because fighting and insecurity have disrupted communications and access in Kordofan, outside groups have struggled to independently verify casualty figures or investigate the circumstances of the drone attacks.</li><li>Regional control: The SPLM-N Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction, which is allied with the RSF, holds much of South Kordofan and parts of neighbouring Blue Nile state, giving it significant territorial influence around Kalogi.</li><li>Conflict escalation: Since the RSF seized El-Fasher, the army’s last major base in western Sudan, rights monitors have reported mass killings, sexual violence, looting and abductions as the group pushes toward the oil-producing Kordofan region.</li></ul><blockquote>Killing children in their school is a horrific violation of children’s rights - Sheldon Yett</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Local Kalogi administration: The head of the Kalogi administrative unit said the town, which is held by the army, was struck three times by drones and held the RSF and its SPLM-N ally responsible for the kindergarten, hospital and rescue-site hits.
