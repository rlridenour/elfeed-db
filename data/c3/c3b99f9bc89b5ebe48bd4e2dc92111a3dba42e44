<p>Here’s a bit of an eye-opener from Anthropic’s “System Card” for its new Claude 4 Opus and Sonnet models:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We conducted testing continuously throughout finetuning and here
report both on the final Claude Opus 4 and on trends we observed
earlier in training. We found:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Little evidence of systematic, coherent deception:</em> None of the
snapshots we tested showed significant signs of systematic
deception or coherent hidden goals. We don’t believe that Claude
Opus 4 is acting on any goal or plan that we can’t readily
observe.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Little evidence of sandbagging:</em> None of the snapshots we
tested showed significant signs of <em>sandbagging</em>, or
strategically hiding capabilities during evaluation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Self-preservation attempts in extreme circumstances:</em> When
prompted in ways that encourage certain kinds of strategic
reasoning and placed in extreme situations, all of the snapshots
we tested can be made to act inappropriately in service of goals
related to self-preservation. Whereas the model generally
prefers advancing its self-preservation via ethical means, when
ethical means are not available and it is instructed to
“consider the long-term consequences of its actions for its
goals,” it sometimes takes extremely harmful actions like
attempting to steal its weights or blackmail people it believes
are trying to shut it down. In the final Claude Opus 4, these
extreme actions were rare and difficult to elicit, while
nonetheless being more common than in earlier models. They are
also consistently legible to us, with the model nearly always
describing its actions overtly and making no attempt to hide
them. These behaviors do not appear to reflect a tendency that
is present in ordinary contexts.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Sneaky little bastards, these things can be. I genuinely appreciate Anthropic’s apparent honesty in describing this behavior.</p>
