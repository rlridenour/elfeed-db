Apple's upcoming foldable iPhone (aka "iPhone Fold") will use OLED panels exclusively supplied by Samsung Display, reports <em><a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=239775">Business Korea</a></em>.<br/>

Apple's decision to rely exclusively on Samsung Display is noteworthy, as it marks a departure from Apple's usual strategy of sourcing components from multiple suppliers to reduce costs and ensure consistent quality.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to use Samsung as the sole supplier of the OLED panels, leaving out LG Display and China's BOE, was reportedly down to Samsung's "technological edge in minimizing screen creases." <br/>
<br/>
"For Apple, which prioritizes quality over price when selecting component suppliers, Samsung was the only viable choice," stated an industry insider quoted in the report.<br/>
<br/>
Based on previous reports, when the device is folded, users will interact with a 5.5-inch outer display that is similar to a typical iPhone screen, while unfolding it will reveal a larger 7.8-inch iPad-style screen with a punch-hole camera. The inner display is said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/25/apple-2026-foldable-phone-has-no-crease/">virtually crease-free</a>, and the screen dimensions have been corroborated by two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">reputable</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/">sources</a>. Instead of Face ID, Apple is said to be using <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">Touch ID integrated into the side button</a> to save internal space. <br/>
