With the context of his insider knowledge, Mark gives us his thoughts on Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">recent announcement</a> that it is further delaying the major <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that it expected to release as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. He gives us a sense of the scale of the crisis and when to expect the remaining features to arrive. We also discuss his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/">recent report</a> about a significant internal reshuffle to move &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; from artificial intelligence chief John Giannandrea to Vision Pro chief Mike Rockwell.<br/>
<br/>
We delve into the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-believes-users-love-major-ios-19-redesign/">complete redesign</a> rumored for &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;, which is believed to be part of a wider push to bring a visionOS-style design language to all of Apple's major platforms. It is expected to be the biggest redesign of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s software since iOS 7. Mark tells us what users are likely to make of the update and why Apple is devoting so much energy to the redesign amid the problems with &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;. He also tells us about the sort of new &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features to expect in &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; and the plan to progressively improve &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; through to iOS 20.<br/>
<br/>
We discuss why the delay in releasing the remaining &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features has delayed the company's long-rumored smart home hub product and the experience it is expected to offer when it launches later this year. We also touch on Apple's problems with allocating developer resources, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17-exclusive &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features, whether Apple is doing enough to course-correct on AI, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ viewing habits, and more.<br/>
