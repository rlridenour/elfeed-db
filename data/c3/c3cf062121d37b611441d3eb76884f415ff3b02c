<p>The Economist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On economics Mr Trump’s assertions are flat-out nonsense. The
president says tariffs are needed to close America’s trade
deficit, which he sees as a transfer of wealth to foreigners. Yet
as any of the president’s economists could have told him, this
overall deficit arises because Americans choose to save less than
their country invests — and, crucially, this long-running reality
has not stopped its economy from outpacing the rest of the g7 for
over three decades. There is no reason why his extra tariffs
should eliminate the deficit. Insisting on balanced trade with
every trading partner individually is bonkers — like suggesting
that Texas would be richer if it insisted on balanced trade with
each of the other 49 states, or asking a company to ensure that
each of its suppliers is also a customer.</p>

<p>And Mr Trump’s grasp of the technicalities was pathetic. He
suggested that the new tariffs were based on an assessment of a
country’s tariffs against America, plus currency manipulation and
other supposed distortions, such as value-added tax. But it looks
as if officials set the tariffs using a formula that takes
America’s bilateral trade deficit as a share of goods imported
from each country and halves it — which is almost as random as
taxing you on the number of vowels in your name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no way to report on these tariffs in a way that is honest and accurate without describing them as bonkers and nonsensical. News publications that are trying to present them as rational, or describing them as “reciprocal” just because that’s the word the White House is using, <a href="https://presswatchers.org/2025/04/mainstream-media-falls-for-trumps-insane-reciprocal-tariff-talk/">are beclowning themselves</a>.</p>
