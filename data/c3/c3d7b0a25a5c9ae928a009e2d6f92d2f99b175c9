Problem: unreadable font in the mode-line Inquired on Reddit1
I use Bookmarks+, a superb package. But for some reason the status message face when I want to delete a bookmark is night unreadable, and although I can customize all the faces that appear in my actual bookmark list, I cannot figure out how to change that one. So, in principle, how do I find out what face is causing the ugliness when it&rsquo;s in my status bar (so I can&rsquo;t do the usual inspecting)?
