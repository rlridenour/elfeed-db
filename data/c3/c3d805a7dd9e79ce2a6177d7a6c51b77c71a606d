<p>President Donald Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Wednesday for a closed-door meeting focused on renewed US-Iran nuclear talks. Trump said the two leaders reached “nothing definitive” on a shared way forward. Still, Trump said he “insisted” that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether a deal can be reached, signaling a continued preference for diplomacy even as tensions remain high. Across the coverage, the main split is over scope and risk. Israel has pressed for any agreement to go beyond nuclear limits and also address Iran’s ballistic missile program and support for armed groups in the region, while US talks with Tehran have been framed mainly around Iran’s nuclear program. Trump has paired diplomacy with warnings of strikes if no agreement emerges, and he has considered steps to bolster the US military posture in the region—signs of how high the stakes remain even as talks continue.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/_bhKaW0KMhK03vzOG7dIQWDqqO_UrotUZguiAh1VG7jZmv5_FAJN0C6Y_5MZFHHssgB9MRPWGrit5-gofkHnX_Xv2OljjiezkI865WaDVJlD' alt='US President Donald Trump meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House (file photo).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Next round: Trump said the next round of negotiations with Tehran could happen as soon as next week.</li><li>Meeting format: Netanyahu’s White House visit was described as more muted than usual, with fewer public moments than in past visits.</li><li>Missiles focus: Trump said a “good deal” would mean “no nuclear weapons, no missiles,” but he did not offer details.</li><li>Carrier option: Trump said he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier strike group as part of a US buildup near Iran, and the Pentagon directed a second carrier group to prepare for possible deployment.</li><li>Gaza mention: Trump said he and Netanyahu also discussed “progress” in Gaza alongside the Iran agenda.</li></ul><blockquote>There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Israel (Netanyahu): Netanyahu said he would present Israel’s “perceptions of the principles” for the negotiations and has pushed to widen any deal to include limits on Iran’s missile program and other regional security issues.
