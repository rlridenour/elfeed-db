<blockquote>
  <p>The new <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence">Amazon Alexa with AI</a> has the same basic problem of
all AI bots, it acts as if it’s human, with a level of intimacy
that you really don’t want to think about, because Alexa is in
your house, with you, listening, all the time. Calling attention
to an idea that there’s a pseudo-human spying on you is bad. Alexa
depends on the opposite impression, that it’s just a computer. I
think AI’s should give up the pretense that they’re human, and
this one should be first.</p>
