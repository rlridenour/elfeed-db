<p>Russia launched its nuclear-capable Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile in an overnight strike in western Ukraine, near the border with NATO member Poland, according to Russian and Ukrainian accounts of the attack. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the use of the new hypersonic system was meant to “send a message” to European countries backing Kyiv. Several outlets described the strike as a warning aimed at deterring continued European support, as discussions about future security arrangements and peace efforts continue.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/v56Fq653PdqM5Z5AEAKcMYsPFg22scuOIGsrZ77sxIpHb3kZrQehR-CVskNQsquYaCqEUp1ccGDbIsUaaqbsNpgRP5l6AupJ4srvP1gp1VW5M4VfYxo_mx1GrHNVQMrdv1T7zXzFEu67GUjOWt7uoHusZOaOER3cyeIGaUgarvC6aOYFND7PpZZJmMcA-szReF0_4FcY1SOWi8Wy03Lv5B8niB67_t9jm9b9Hq8b2EzAp9UoBMqAAmWavEzKkCvgrsA_8uT9_9KzsV-aA-4o6KDkePrS7z-UYYiJpdeSj8IdwF7QgoVN_IRHeiEHt4nhtpj6TqO640nGbZG_tqsu7RQR21Ht5W0rGmklokRbSW4GhuMk8hwO1qmDAZkBdrnCFhnIIpe_vfcUCv-y7AnHziZlLn6FFsLlX4cOoj7P_NIXe-AXzROqvwDXTP9SzXtNoPTf8-t18vM0b6sJbmQYbvdB1Xk8tQ' alt='' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Hard to stop: The Oreshnik is described as a medium-range (non-intercontinental) ballistic missile that flies at hypersonic speed, reaches a suborbital altitude, and can release up to six warheads, factors that compress warning time and complicate interception.</li><li>Second reported use: The Jan. 2026 strike was described as only the second time Russia has launched the Oreshnik in combat, highlighting its role as a signaling weapon as much as a battlefield one.</li><li>Targeting claims: Euronews reported the Oreshnik strike hit the Lviv area in western Ukraine and was said to target a critical infrastructure site.</li><li>Broader barrage: PBS described the missile launch as part of an intense, wider attack on Ukraine, with the Oreshnik’s nuclear-capable design adding an extra layer of concern for nearby European states.</li><li>Message to allies: Kyiv’s European allies characterized the strike near Poland’s border as an intimidation attempt aimed at weakening external support for Ukraine.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ukraine (President Volodymyr Zelenskyy): Zelenskyy said Russia used the hypersonic missile to send a message to other European nations.
