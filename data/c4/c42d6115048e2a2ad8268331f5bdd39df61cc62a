<p>French authorities searched X’s Paris premises on Tuesday as part of an investigation that began in January 2025. Prosecutors said they have summoned Elon Musk for a “voluntary interview” in Paris on April 20, 2026. They said the probe looks at allegations that X’s algorithms were used to interfere in French politics, and also covers suspected offenses involving sexually explicit deepfakes and child sexual abuse material. French authorities and some outlets also reported that X’s AI chatbot Grok is being examined in connection with the investigation. The raid follows a yearlong investigation and raises the stakes in a broader standoff between European officials and U.S. tech companies over how social media is regulated.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/N1vL9gZ__Ls_sbAvVTv-TkgmFA9EpGo5QRiU7EzV6gsLO8QtEbM2awcPXd-e73tPMfESGU_az0Wp9pcP9O0lcat-APg00xaw5rytdydnviNi' alt='Elon Musk, owner of X, pictured in a file photo.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Interview scope: Prosecutors said they sent summonses to both Elon Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino, calling them the platform’s “de facto and de jure” managers at the time of the alleged events.
