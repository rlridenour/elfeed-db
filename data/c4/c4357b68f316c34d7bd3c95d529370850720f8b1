<blockquote>
  <p>Amazon has quietly walked back new James Bond thumbnail artwork on
its Prime Video service following controversy over digital
alterations to the original art. <a href="https://www.darkhorizons.com/amazons-new-posters-disarm-james-bond/">As reported here yesterday</a>,
the art was unveiled on the weekend to coincide with James Bond
Day celebrations on Sunday.</p>

<p>Bond fans quickly noticed that the artwork had undergone some
amateur photoshopping, which either cropped or airbrushed out
his signature Walther PPK gun from the original image in a
variety of ways.</p>

<p>The results were widely derided on social media; films like <em>Dr.
No</em> and <em>Goldeneye</em> appeared to have Bond making a rude gesture,
while others like <em>A View to a Kill</em> elongated Roger Moore’s arms
well past the point of any human.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The updated ones just kinda suck. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/10/no-gun-bond-posters.jpeg">Amazon’s original “new” posters</a> were downright hilariously bad. This bodes poorly for the Bond franchise’s future.</p>
