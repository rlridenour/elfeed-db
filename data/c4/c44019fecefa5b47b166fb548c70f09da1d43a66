<p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in Bengaluru, India, that Iran’s clerical leadership may be in its “final days and weeks,” arguing a government that relies on violence to stay in power has effectively run out of legitimacy. His remarks come as nationwide protests in Iran—initially sparked by economic hardship and the rial’s collapse—have broadened into anti-regime demonstrations calling for the fall of the Islamic Republic’s leadership. Rights groups cited by multiple outlets report hundreds of protesters have been killed and thousands arrested in a continuing crackdown.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/-JHCC0p0yCDKTHnzUvPm8ENEl76OxfNKZE2MWNOfvocjFRdnUUCNYJXL8GgT_RFJe--tzay5d0sMkRDqxN_iVhBAbnR22qv_9xQCOkYGJRLNJS6u7Xi9F1bUGIDNaQu3UgU1O5wvncne8BRm9EFNPgoHOwCF5zlSsq7jw_DlW5Xs5qO2CcTxkgIEh7WyJLtPv6OIMx2tJfs0qi0fmQn2ji4nmEbYPmRRs_jsVpkjAsjoE536YqM7FF6qGERERb1-4swL_1Ziusx_ua1N53Wv8A' alt='Image from The Guardian’s live coverage of the Iran protests and international responses.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>EU sanctions signal: EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she is prepared to push for tougher sanctions on Iran as reports of the crackdown continue.</li><li>IRGC designation debate: Merz’s conservative bloc has long backed listing Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as an EU terrorist organization, and senior lawmakers have recently urged ministers to act.</li><li>Trilateral condemnation: Merz joined UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron in a joint statement condemning reported violence by Iranian security forces and the killing of protesters.</li><li>Trade pressure lever: President Donald Trump said the U.S. plans to impose 25% tariffs on countries that continue economic trade with Iran.</li><li>Economic trigger details: The Guardian reported the protests began in Tehran on 28 December after the rial’s collapse, and intensified as the government ended a subsidized exchange rate for importers, contributing to higher grocery prices.</li></ul><blockquote>If a regime can only stay in power through violence, then it is effectively finished. - Friedrich Merz</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz: Merz says Iran’s leadership may be nearing its end because a government that can only maintain power through violence has effectively lost legitimacy, while expressing hope for a peaceful end to the conflict.
