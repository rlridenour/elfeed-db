<p>Social media platform X (formerly Twitter) suffered a widespread disruption on Friday, with users in multiple countries reporting problems loading the app and website. Outage trackers showed tens of thousands of user-submitted reports in the United States, alongside notable spikes in the UK and India, suggesting broad international reach. Several outlets said service largely returned after roughly an hour, offering some relief for people and organizations that rely on X for real-time updates. This was described as the second global outage within a week, and X did not immediately respond to a request for comment, according to reporting cited by multiple outlets.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Qm5wgjqLUlPGTdkwsBs5lGi48GwlfY3Om_f-4BjKuECgmDkCvQsdX9R0D8pApQ9MgKF-_khqKLD8nKyJLIRD9HLFmFAtNHzBULbk4B1uRWNH' alt='The logo of social media platform X is seen in this illustration taken on July 24, 2023.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Error screens: Some users reported seeing blank pages and Cloudflare-branded error screens, though reporting said the underlying problem appeared to be with X rather than a repeat of recent Cloudflare issues.</li><li>Regional snapshots: One account of the disruption noted Downdetector complaints spiking in Pakistan in the evening local time, while UK users logged thousands of incidents and India saw thousands of reports as well.</li><li>Repeat disruption: DW reported the platform briefly went down earlier in the week too, reinforcing that this week’s reliability troubles were not a one-off event.</li><li>User experience: Reports described feeds failing to refresh and the app showing older posts from hours earlier, a common symptom when backend systems cannot deliver new content.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Downdetector and affected users: User-submitted outage reports surged across several countries, indicating widespread difficulties accessing or loading X during the disruption.
