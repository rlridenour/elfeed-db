The online store launched today, seven months after Apple announced that a direct online purchasing option for Saudi Arabia <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/12/apple-announces-apple-retail-expansion-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/">was in the works</a>. Prior to now, Apple users in Saudi Arabia could only shop from Apple Authorized Resellers.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to bringing online purchasing to Saudi Arabia, Apple is planning to open several retail store locations starting in 2026. One of the retail locations will be a flagship store at Diriyah, NESCO World Heritage site located just on the outskirts of Riyadh, the capital city of Saudi Arabia.<br/>
