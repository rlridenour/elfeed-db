How long is a blog post? Some people write <a href="https://dancullum.com/">short
posts</a> with one clear thought. Others write <a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/">longer</a>
essays.
</p>

<p>
I tend to start out writing a short post and then
get distracted by all the rabbit-holes I want to
go down. Drafting my thoughts on blogging leads to
adding lots of blogs to my reader, writing some
code that <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/03/reading-more-blogs-emacs-lisp-listing-blogs-based-on-an-opml-file/">takes an OPML and makes a table of blogs
and their most recent posts</a>, fixing the
<a href="https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes">org-html-themes</a> setup for my <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs">Emacs configuration</a>,
breaking out <i>this</i> chunk as its own post, drawing
a bunch of mindmaps, doing a braindump, tweaking
my workflow for processing braindumps to use
<a href="https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper">faster-whisper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Softcatala/whisper-ctranslate2">whisper-ctranslate2</a> instead of
<a href="https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX">WhisperX</a> because of <a href="https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX/issues/894">this issue</a>, so that I can try
the <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo">whisper-large-v3-turbo</a> model, experimenting
with workflows for reviewing the PDF on the
iPad&#x2026; Definitely lots of <a href="https://seths.blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that/">yak-shaving</a> (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">wiktionary
definition</a>). I still want to write that post. I
already have the <a href="https://sketches.sachachua.com/filename/2025-03-16-01%20Old-school%20blogger%20&#45;&#45;%20blogging%20writing.jpeg">sketch</a> I want to include in it.
It's like Chilli in the Bluey episode <a href="https://www.bluey.tv/watch/season-2/sticky-gecko/">Sticky Gecko</a>
(<a href="https://www.bluey.tv/watch/season-2/sticky-gecko/">script</a>): "The door: It is right here. All we need
to do is walk out of it: it's so easy!" The
thought! It's right there! Just get to it, brain!
But I wander because I wonder. I suppose that's
all right.
</p>

<p>
It might be fun to play around with the sizes of
things I share: shorter when my attention is
fragmented or squirrely, longer when I can think about
something over several days or years. Here are
some ways to tinker with that.
</p>

<p>
<b>Breaking thoughts down into smaller chunks</b> so I can get them out the door:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When I notice that something is a big blog
post (like this reflection I've been working
on about blogging), I can break out parts of
it into their own blog posts and then replace
that section with links.</li>
<li>I can post interesting quotes and snippets to
<a href="https://social.sachachua.com">Mastodon</a> and then <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/09/archiving-public-toots-on-my-blog/">round them up periodically</a>
or refer to them in blog posts. <mark>TODO:</mark> It
might be good to have a shortcut for an
accessible link to a toot using a speech
bubble or similar icon.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Taming my tangents and ideas:</b> I'm sometimes
envious of blogs with <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/11/thinking-about-webpage-margins/#:~:text=and%20visual%20variety.-,Sidenotes,-?%20I%20like">neat side notes</a>, but really,
I should just accept that the tangents that my
mind wants to go on can take paragraphs and are
more suited to, say, collapsible details or a
different blog post. Something I can experiment
with: instead of gallivanting off on that tangent
(soo hard to resist when there's an idea for an
Emacs tweak!), I can add a TODO and leave it for
my future self. Maybe even two TODOs: one inline,
where it makes sense in the text; and one in my
Org Mode, with a link to the blog post so that I
can go back and update it when (if!) I get around
to it. Who knows, maybe someone might comment with
something that already exists.
</p>

<p>
<b>Saving scraps:</b> It's easier to cut out
half-fleshed-out ideas if I tell myself I'm just
<a href="https://www.reproof.app/blog/writing-and-the-cutting-room-floor">saving them somewhere</a>. Right now I capture/refile
them to a scraps heading, but there's probably a
better way to handle this. Maybe I can post some
thoughts to Mastodon and then save the toot URL.
Maybe I can experiment with using Denote to manage
private notes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Connecting thoughts and building them up:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2014/11/thinking-word-counts-chunks/">I tend to write in small chunks.</a> (<mark>TODO:</mark> I
could probably do some kind of word-count
analysis, might be
neat.) <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2013/12/update-developing-thoughts-further/">Sketchnotes</a> and <a href="https://kottke.org/24/11/the-powerful-density-of-hypertextual-writing">hyperlinks</a> might help me
chunk thoughts so I can think about bigger
things. I can <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/02/adding-an-anchor-to-a-paragraph-in-org-mode-html-export/">link to paragraphs and text
fragments</a>, so I can connect thoughts with other
parts of thoughts instead of trying to get the
granularity right the first time around. The
shortcuts I made for linking to <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#linking-to-blog-posts">blog posts</a> and
searching the <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/10/yay-emacs-inserting-links-with-consult-omni/">Web</a> or <a href="https://sachachua.com/dotemacs#searching-my-blog">my notes</a> are starting to
help.</li>
<li>I sporadically work on <a href="https://sachachua.com/topic">topic maps</a> or indices.
Maybe I'll gradually flesh them out into a
digital garden / personal wiki.</li>
<li>Sometimes I don't remember the exact words I
used. <a href="https://github.com/zkry/p-search">Probabilistic search</a> or vector search
might help here, too. I don't need an
AI-generated summary, I just want a list of
related posts.</li>
<li>I can figure out how to add backlinks to my
blog, or simplify the workflow for adding
links to previous posts. Maybe something based
on <a href="https://blog.rubenwardy.com/2023/10/29/eleventy-backlinks/">this guide for 11ty</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-plugin-backlinks">binyamin/eleventy-plugin-backlinks</a>. I might
need to write something custom anyway so that
I can ignore the links coming from
monthly/weekly review posts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Connecting to other people's thoughts:</b> For the
purposes of conversation, it'll probably be good
to let people know if I write something about
their blog post. Doesn't happen automatically.
Pingbacks and referrer logs got too swamped by
spam a long time ago, so I don't think anyone
really uses them. <mark>Idea:</mark> It might be neat to have
something that quickly lists all the external
links in a post, and maybe a way to save the
e-mail addresses or Mastodon handles for people
after I look them up so that I can make that even
smoother, and some kind of quick template. I can
send email and toot from within Emacs, so that's
totally doable&#x2026; (No, I am <i>not</i> going to write
it right now, I'm going to add it to my to-do
list.)
</p>

<p>
(Also, there's another thought here about books
and The Great Conversation, and blogs and
smaller-scale conversations, and William
Thurston and <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/199/thurston.pdf">mathematicians and understanding</a>,
and cafes&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
Hmm. I think that getting my brain to make smaller
chunks and get them out the door will be a good
thing to focus on. Synthesizing can come later.
