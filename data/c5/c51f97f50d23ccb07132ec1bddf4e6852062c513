<p>Hamas handed over the remains of Lt. Hadar Goldin to Israel on Sunday, ending an 11-year period during which his body was held in Gaza following fighting in 2014; Israeli forensic experts confirmed the identification, and the handover followed procedures tied to the current ceasefire arrangements. Goldin was killed in the 2014 Gaza war, reportedly about two hours after a ceasefire had been declared, a detail highlighted by multiple reports as the case is revisited after more than a decade. Officials and family members described the return as a painful but long-awaited closure; the transfer is one of a series of remains and hostage returns documented since the ceasefire began on October 10.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PcPdHzJsAkQZYPARfHjW2y0HDvcCBU2MwKH_n7ipqwx8vtSl5LCn64DqTP9tB0wgdETRw9PDCHWlMd7f9eQQXCeX_zjIBJj1ELAzbVBKKz64o1Xlnoa9o1KWT0dxNff6xn_Y7_dR65w8LKwmP6guqs8TTxxmZjLrE9uNPxhqgF6LI5JiHhJuzZ-MpsMwMxVAwKf5SX9R5cjrJ2huuegveA' alt='Posters in southern Israel of Hadar Goldin, whose body had been held in Gaza for over a decade.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Family reaction: Goldin&#x27;s parents publicly thanked the Israeli military while lamenting years of perceived government inaction over his case, calling the return deeply personal for their family.</li><li>Return tally: Israeli officials say Goldin is the 24th deceased hostage whose remains have been returned by Hamas since the ceasefire that began on October 10, a sequence tracked by multiple outlets.</li><li>Forensic confirmation: Israeli forensic teams completed tests after the handover and formally confirmed the remains belonged to Lt.
