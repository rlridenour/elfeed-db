<blockquote><p>
Carrying two brown satchels, one filled with $777,000 in $100 bills and the other empty, an unidentified man, dressed in jeans and cowboy boots, walked into Binion&#8217;s Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas last week. He exchanged his money for $500 chips, strode to the craps table and put all of the chips on the back line, which meant that he was betting against the woman who happened to be rolling the dice. She first threw a six, then a nine and finally a seven. Said the dealer: &#8216;Pay the back line.&#8217; The man scooped up his chips, traded them at the casino cage for $1,554,000 in cash and shook hands with Jack Binion, the stunned president of the casino. Said Binion: &#8216;It was the biggest bet in a gambling house that I have ever heard of.&#8217; As the man walked out of the casino with his two brown satchels, both now stuffed with $100 bills, and climbed into his car, he told Binion: &#8216;You know, this damned inflation was just eroding this money. I figured I might as well double it or lose it.&#8217; With that, he drove off into the night, still unidentified.
