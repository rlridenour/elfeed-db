</ul><h1>Whoopsie</h1><p>Hi sweetie, I’m back from running that errand you asked me to do!</p>
<p>What do you mean, what took me so long? You ask me to do a doozy like that, of course, I’m going to be a minute!</p>
<p>Yeah, actually, it <em>was</em> a doozy, sweetie. You told me to do Harrison Ford’s agent a favor related to his Chevy Nova. By which I assume you meant that I should service it, given how good I am with cars.</p>
<p>Well, lo and behold, Harrison Ford’s agent doesn’t <em>have</em> a Chevy Nova, so I had to go get him one. And then, when I pulled up, nobody seemed particularly happy to see me. A vintage car, expertly serviced, and the way this guy talked to me, you would’ve thought I was trespassing!</p>
<p>Anyway, he wouldn’t accept the car, so I left it on the street with the keys on the dash. Maybe you could call him up and let him know it’s out there? See if you can get him to apologize while you’re at it. Also, sweetie, why didn’t you ever mention this friendship with Harrison Ford’s agent? One degree of separation from <em>Indiana Jones</em>? The guys at the garage would be amazed!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That’s <em>not</em> what you asked me to do?</p>
<p>So, wait, what <em>did</em> you say?</p>
<p>You needed forks and spoons and knives and stuff? For a dinner party? Tonight? One we’ve been planning for weeks? And you wanted a special kind? A simple yet elegant variety? With a gentle scallop accent on each one? And I’ve somehow managed to wildly misunderstand the brand name?</p>
<p>Huh??</p>
<p>Here, write it down.</p>
<p>Okay, I see. But where did I get the favor part from?</p>
<p>Oh, really? That’s how that word is pronounced?</p>
<p>Well, great news, sweetie! I did a little search, and it turns out my favorite deal site is selling this exact flatware set! Today!</p>
<p>No, they actually can’t do same-day delivery to ensure we’ll get the set for the party tonight. It was the <em>other</em> deal site I liked that was bought by the company that delivers everything fast.</p>
<p>Like, jeez, sweetie, I talk about this all the time. I wish you’d listen a little more carefully!</p>
