<p>I learned a long time ago that environment variables are literally represented
as the string <code>NAME=value</code> (you can see this by running <code>cat /proc/self/environ</code> on Linux).</p>
<p>But what I never thought about until Kamal mentioned it to me yesterday was
that you can technically put <em>any</em> string in your environment, it doesn&rsquo;t have
to have an equals sign.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a C program that does that and runs <code>env</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    char *weird_env[] = {
        &quot;NAME=value&quot;,
        &quot;banana&quot;,
        NULL
    };
   char *argv[] = {&quot;/usr/bin/env&quot;, NULL};
   execve(&quot;/usr/bin/env&quot;, argv, weird_env);
}
</code></pre>
<p>It prints out</p>
<pre><code>NAME=value
banana
</code></pre>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this has any real practical implications. If you run a shell
like <code>bash</code> with this &ldquo;banana&rdquo; variable it&rsquo;ll just ignore it.</p>
