A few 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro configurations with an M4 Pro chip are not facing any shipping delay, but estimated delivery dates for many configurations with an M4 Max chip range from February 6 to February 24 or even later. At the extreme end, all built-to-order 14-inch MacBook Pro configurations with a 16-core M4 Max chip and 128GB of RAM are estimated to be delivered as late as March 17 on Apple's online store.<br/>

The entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-macbook-pro-with-m5-chip/">updated with an M5 chip in October</a>, but the wait continues for MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. There were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/14/macbook-pro-january/">already some signs</a> that might point towards Apple announcing those models as early as this week, and perhaps the extended delivery timeframes further hint at an imminent refresh. However, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/apple-to-weather-dram-price-surge/">ongoing RAM supply constraints</a> could also be contributing to the shipping delays.<br/>

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-announces-m2-pro-macbook-pro/">unveiled MacBook Pro models with M2 Pro and M2 Max chips</a> in January 2023, so there is precedent for a MacBook Pro refresh in January.
