</ul><h1>Lots Of It</h1><p>Just this past week, in a game against the Sacramento Kings, LeBron James took the court with a new piece of swag on his uniform. From the <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/lebron-james-topps-jersey-patch-23rd-nba-season">NBA’s official site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James will wear a special-edition 23rd season jersey patch starting tonight in Sacramento, where his legendary career began in 2003.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, how cool, right? Just a celebration of one of the game’s greats, with nary a secondary motive to be fou–</p>
<p>Oh, wait, hold on. We missed the next sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The patches will be removed after each game, and some will be placed into upcoming Topps trading cards, the company announced Monday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it’s just a way to move some cards. Fair enough.</p>
<p>Still, we wanted to honor King James in our own way: by selling wine. After all, the man is a regular sommelier when he’s off the court!</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.wineenthusiast.com/culture/wine/lebron-james-wine-collector/?srsltid=AfmBOooEVI_7Z1KM4cwcrwS7iE8CGdLlUnF3opjv8eAMCl1gTRiZ9HPO">Wine Enthusiast</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the game’s greatest players, James’s taste in bottles looms as large as his presence on the court. But it’s social media where he’s connected with the public, drawing attention to wine in a way many celebrity partnerships strive to achieve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And sure, this stuff might be just a <em>tiny</em> bit cheaper than the wine LeBron drinks. At least, that’s if you believe <a href="https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2024/08/lebron-spends-100k-on-french-wine-after-paris-olympics/">this report from The Drink Business</a> about his purchases following the 2024 Olympics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the source, [LeBron James and Draymond Green] spent more than US$75,000 on wine and spirits, including two bottles of 2004 Leroy Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru at US$9,400 per bottle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But still, we like to think he might have a soft spot for anyone practicing the ancient art of wine-making. After all, look at his career.</p>
<p>Did he not do two stints with the Cleveland Cabs? Where his teammates included such players as Zindrunas Ilgauskas and Mo(scato) Williams? And did he not tweet “My favorite player in the draft #Napier” in 2014, referring to Shiraz Napier?</p>
<p>Or, heck, look across the court! Who can forget those conference finals battles he had with Chicago Bulls, led by none other than Derrick Rosé. Why, even this year, at the age of 41, he put up 28 points, 10 assists, and 7 rebounds against the Jazz, likely excited to look at the opposing team’s roster and see Chianti George.</p>
<p>Okay, fine, this one’s a stretch. But what’s important is that we’re selling big juice boxes full of wine. So if you want some wine, please buy it from us.</p>
