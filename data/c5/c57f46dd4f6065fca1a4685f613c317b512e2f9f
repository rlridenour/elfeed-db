<p>Apple Newsroom, last week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced the launch of Digital ID, a new way for
users to create an ID in Apple Wallet using information from their
U.S. passport, and present it with the security and privacy of
iPhone or Apple Watch. At launch, Digital ID acceptance will roll
out first in beta at TSA checkpoints at more than 250 airports in
the U.S. for in-person identity verification during domestic
travel, with additional Digital ID acceptance use cases to come in
the future.</p>

<p>Digital ID gives more people a way to create and present an ID in
Apple Wallet even if they do not have a REAL ID-compliant driver’s
license or state ID. Digital ID is not a replacement for a
physical passport, and cannot be used for international travel and
border crossing in lieu of a U.S. passport.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I set this up over the weekend and it was about as easy and seamless as you could hope. <a href="https://learn.wallet.apple/id">More information from Apple here</a>, and an overview of the feature, as implemented by Apple and Google (for Android) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/travel/digital-identification-travel.html?unlocked_article_code=1.2E8.G_Tr.DMy_XMguwE_c&amp;smid=url-share">from The New York Times here</a> (gift link).</p>
