<p>President Trump sent a letter to Israeli President Isaac Herzog asking him to consider pardoning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his long-running corruption trial, a move Herzog&#x27;s office confirmed it received on Wednesday and said requires a formal request under established procedures. The letter follows Mr. Trump’s recent visit to Israel, when he publicly urged a pardon during an address to parliament, and adds a direct US entreaty into a sensitive domestic legal matter in Israel. The request could heighten political tensions in Israel and draw international attention to the trial, which has been a focal point of national debate.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/UkGvjuc6w8TbO8SNHpzLKOZ1bWbWvfH9Ihd32DquT1rvarrxSUZNVBUmlA2jVPXcdYYyhzbqJz-eijuQFuVxzDN2G-63eadVlYMMGMLsjGhg' alt='President Donald Trump talks with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Knesset during a recent visit to Jerusalem.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Trump’s reasoning: In his letter President Trump characterized the prosecution as politicized and said Netanyahu had &quot;fought alongside me...against the very tough adversary of Israel, Iran,&quot; arguing the case was &quot;political, unjustified prosecution&quot;.</li><li>Presidential powers: Although largely ceremonial, the Israeli presidency does hold legal authority to grant pardons in exceptional situations, a power the president can use under unusual circumstances.</li><li>Trial background: Netanyahu has faced a long-running trial since being indicted in 2019 on three separate corruption cases, including allegations of receiving nearly 700,000 shekels in gifts, and he has pleaded not guilty.</li><li>Domestic divide: Observers and commentators note the trial has bitterly divided Israeli society and politics, making any external intervention especially sensitive for leaders in Jerusalem.</li></ul><blockquote>While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli justice system, and its requirements, I believe that this case against Bibi (Netanyahu), who has fought alongside me for a long time, including against the very tough adversary of Israel, Iran, is a political, unjustified prosecution - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He described the prosecution as political and urged the president to consider a pardon for Netanyahu, citing their long-standing alliance and shared stance on Iran.
