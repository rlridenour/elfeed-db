<p>The United States and Iran say they will hold high-level talks in Muscat, Oman, on Friday, February 6, after several days of uncertainty over the meeting’s timing, format and whether it would go ahead. Oman is hosting the meeting, and Iran’s foreign minister thanked the country for organizing it. Washington and Tehran still disagree on what the talks should cover. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, say they want discussions to go beyond the nuclear file to include Iran’s missile capabilities (and other issues in some accounts). Iranian officials say the talks should focus only on the nuclear program. The meeting comes amid heightened tensions cited in coverage, including a U.S. military report that it shot down an Iranian drone, Iranian threats involving shipping, and public warnings from President Trump aimed at Iran’s leadership.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qgSfNxr5DHcxbjpbCsLetsE4OFcfT-KPzbmh5xZ_1wcB4MyJ2lPPB8OqT1IcvwEYBZZh1wM9ll_Gc5RA9wVtDpQmC7UEBsxKAeGJifUR5nst' alt='Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is pictured in a Reuters file photo referenced by Dawn.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Time and venue: Iran’s foreign minister said the meeting is set for around 10 a.m. Friday in Muscat and thanked Oman for the arrangements; a U.S. official also confirmed the plan.</li><li>What nearly derailed it: Coverage described hours of uncertainty tied not only to the “format,” but also to a dispute over location.
