<p>CNBC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The multi-year partnership will lean on Google’s Gemini and cloud
technology for future Apple foundational models, according to a
joint statement obtained by CNBC’s Jim Cramer.</p>

<p>“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology
provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models
and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will
unlock for our users,” Apple said in a statement on Monday.</p>

<p>The models will continue to run on Apple devices and the company’s
private cloud compute, they added. Apple declined to comment on
the terms of the deal. Google referred CNBC to the joint
statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s the whole announcement, at least for now. A statement that, as far as I can see, went only to CNBC (and Jim Cramer specifically, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/jim+cramer">of all people</a>).</p>

<p>There’s slightly more detail in <a href="https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010746083170046376">this brief announcement from Google</a>, on, of all places, Twitter/X:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joint Statement: Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year
collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation
Models will be based on Google’s Gemini models and cloud
technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence
features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.</p>

<p>After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google’s Al
[<em>sic</em>] technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple
Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new
experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence
will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute,
while maintaining Apple’s industry-leading privacy standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suspect more details will be forthcoming from Apple sooner rather than later. But for now, that’s it.</p>

<p>This phrasing, in both Apple’s statement to Cramer and the joint Apple/Google statement released by Google, is, I think subtly telling about how significant this news is: “Google’s AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models”. There’s a slight redundancy with <em>foundation</em> appearing twice in the span of four words. Imagine if WebKit had been named “Safari Rendering Engine” — there would be times when one might need to write “the rendering engine is Safari Rendering Engine”, because that’s what it is, and that’s the name. But in this case, it’s a bit incongruous. A foundation is a foundation; it doesn’t have a foundation. So this brief bit of phrasing reveals the obvious, awkward truth that Apple Foundation Models didn’t actually have a foundation.</p>

<p>Also, perhaps some evidence of OCR copy-and-pasting: in the tweet of the joint statement, marked by “[<em>sic</em>]” above, AI is spelled uppercase-A lowercase-L. <strong>Update:</strong> Same misspelling in <a href="https://blog.google/company-news/inside-google/company-announcements/joint-statement-google-apple/?ref=jagsworkshop.com">the version of the announcement</a> hosted on Google’s own news site.</p>
