<p>Yesterday I went to the cardiologist for a physical stress test. That&rsquo;s the kind of test where they have you run on a treadmill on an incline with a bunch of wires attached to you to check how your heart and your circulatory system work. I asked for this exam because of hereditary high cholesterol levels that are raging in both my mom and dad, and going back to my grandparents.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m usually an active guy who tries to exercise every single day on my gym equipment here at home. I&rsquo;m far from being &ldquo;jacked&rdquo; or anything like that, but I&rsquo;ve never been overweight, and all in all, I&rsquo;ve kept an almost vegetarian diet for most of my life (chicken breast twice a week or so). I cut out cheese and dairy from my diet completely about two months ago. This will only help somewhat; it will probably only buy me a couple of years before I have to take medications, probably.</p>
<p>I was happy with the quality stress check they did on me yesterday. It was long and thorough. They took the time (about half an hour) to check everything <em>before</em> they put me on the treadmill. The test itself started fine, I walk every day (even on short days, I try always to take the stairs), and I was comfortable even at high walking speeds with an incline. But when they had me start running, I was out of breath within minutes.</p>
<p>This is a test that is designed to push my comfort levels. To get to that point, they had to include higher speeds and additional incline, but still, I didn&rsquo;t like how fast I was uncomfortable with jogging. I used to have the ability to switch to what I call &ldquo;running breaths,&rdquo; where I breathe through my nose and exhale through my mouth and maintain this for a pretty long time. At my best, I would go for more than an hour at a low speed before I stopped, still comfortable. I was never a fast runner, but I was in decent shape. Yesterday, I had to ask them to stop. I was lying on the bed after the run so that they could check my heart rate, and I was breathing hard and couldn&rsquo;t hold my breath too long when they asked me so that they could check me.</p>
<p>This annoys me. To this point, I&rsquo;ve been fairly flexible with my exercise routine, and to be fair, I got around to it most days of the week sooner or later (sometimes after a nap, as I still have my sleeping issues). But these are strength exercises with weights, and they are usually short, around 20-30 minutes or so.  I tried to pick up running a few months ago, but I let my daily workload at my job and the rising temperature convince me to give up on it.</p>
<p>These days, a week doesn&rsquo;t go by where people close to me are telling me that I work too much, probably because that&rsquo;s all I talk about. I can make adjustments to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_hygiene">sleep hygiene</a>, but I know it will only go so far. I&rsquo;ve been sleeping too little and making up for it later in the day for some five or six years, and I&rsquo;m able to adjust to a degree.</p>
<p>The problem with running is that it needs to be a morning habit. I need to wake up early and have enough energy to go outside. I can start by walking and go on from there - this is my usual Jedi mind trick - but the time of day must be the morning because there is no later time for running. That&rsquo;s a problem because of my sleep, which is a problem because of work, and the little time I already have for myself as is.</p>
