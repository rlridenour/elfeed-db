<p>Portugal’s presidential election moved to a second round after Socialist Party candidate António José Seguro finished first in the initial vote, ahead of André Ventura, the leader of the far-right Chega party. With 11 candidates on the ballot and outgoing President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa barred by term limits, the first round narrowed the field to a head-to-head contest scheduled for February 8. The result keeps Portugal’s transition to a new president firmly within a clear democratic timetable, while highlighting the growing strength of populist forces that analysts say are rising across parts of Europe.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/_qdiIgDLtomKrzpMp212SzOSEpVARI2l1Pp6npHBBB6Xkz0DIRSW14PPttTi1DPvflfEKc_UBwdy0vuUFpbiUYyD1ZL8KV1C2wRHEUGHbFjizO5sgzGisdDftBMNd6tmDALA6xBQ4QTKlaNEmQbGTcnYsvWaW7TlVudVVel6B_9Udo2Vsg' alt='Socialist candidate José Antonio Seguro on the evening of the first round of the presidential election in Caldas da Rainha, Portugal, on January 18, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Vote split: First-round results reported Seguro on 30.6% and Ventura on 24.2%, a gap that sets up a competitive runoff.</li><li>Poll expectations: Le Monde noted that surveys going into the runoff suggested Ventura is likely to lose despite his surge to second place.</li><li>Crowded field: Euronews highlighted the unusually large slate of 11 candidates, underscoring a fragmented first-round landscape.</li><li>Europe context: Euronews framed Ventura’s performance as part of a broader pattern of far-right breakthroughs in Europe’s recent elections.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>António José Seguro campaign: Seguro’s first-place finish positions him as the front-runner going into the February 8 runoff against Ventura.
