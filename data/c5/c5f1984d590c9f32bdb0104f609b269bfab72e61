<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Each year I forget the joy crocuses bring.  The first to bloom, ever a surprise at where they might sprout.
</p>
        <p>Last year, we removed a few trees (110 feet tall and split at the base).  It
hurt my heart to fell such grand trees, but they were a danger to us and our
neighbors.  The heavy equipment used wrecked the yard, so they brought in some
soil to smooth things over.</p>
<p>As part of turning up that soil, they must&rsquo;ve scattered many crocus bulbs. My
yard has 50 or more clusters bursting forth.  And in these teetering days of
late winter and early spring, the crocuses herald change.</p>
<div class="verse">
Each year, brave and resolute,<br />
You sneak upon the field<br />
And show your colors for all<br />
To feel what defiance means;<br />
Taunting winter’s last fury;<br />
Daring the old man to spit<br />
Frost and ice on greening field.<br />
Brave young crocus you are not<br />
Alone but amidst a field<br />
Of brothers and sisters true<br />
To the cause of waking spring.<br />
<br />
Quick, before you fade and wilt<br />
Might I join you for a spell?<br />
