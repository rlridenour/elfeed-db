Apple Ginza was Apple's first retail store location outside of the United States when it opened in 2003. The flagship store included a 27-foot Genius Bar, an 84-seat theater, and an internet cafe for customers to visit.<br/>
<br/>
The Sayegusa Building where Apple Ginza was located needed to be updated, so in 2022, Apple moved the store to a temporary location. Apple is now ready to reopen Apple Ginza, and the new store has received a number of upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
There is an Apple Pickup station for customers to pick up online orders, a Genius Bar, a seating area for one-on-one <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> demos, and a space for Today at Apple sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Customers in Japan can attend the store opening on Friday, September 26 at 10:00 a.m. local time, and Cook will be in attendance. The store will be selling special-edition Apple Gift Cards for the reopening, and Apple also <a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/retail/ginza-preview/">shared special wallpaper</a> designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/24/tim-cook-japan-visit/">Apple CEO Tim Cook Meets Pikachu During Japan Visit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-meets-pikachu-during-japan-visit.2467423/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
