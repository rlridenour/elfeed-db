Apple today announced that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/">WWDC 2025 starts June 9</a>, and the logo for the conference hints at iOS 19's rumored new design.<br/>

<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-visionos-redesign-rumors/">Multiple sources have claimed that iOS 19 will feature a new design</a> that is inspired by visionOS, the software platform for Apple's Vision Pro headset. The new design is expected to include more translucent buttons and menus, with a glass-like appearance. The "25" in this year's WWDC logo also has a subtle visionOS-like appearance.<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 19 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/major-macos-16-redesign-biggest-since-big-sur/">and macOS 16</a> are also expected to have visionOS-like designs, which would make Apple's software platforms look more uniform.<br/>
<br/>
In January, the YouTube channel Front Page Tech shared a render of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">redesigned Camera app</a> that is allegedly planned for iOS 19.<br/>

According to Front Page Tech host Jon Prosser, the Camera app will have more translucent buttons and menus, along with a larger viewfinder.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the visionOS-like design changes will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">extend to other interfaces on iOS 19</a>, meaning that the new look with more transparency will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-19-messages-app-mockup/">likely extend to other Apple apps</a>, notifications, and more.<br/>

Gurman believes that iOS 19 will have the most significant design changes since iOS 7.<br/>
