<p>It is overwhelming, what you need to learn to be able to use Emacs well. The operative word here is “well.” I can use Emacs badly. In the sense, that what is taking me some effort to achieve might be possible to do quicker and more efficiently if only I knew how to improve the process.</p>
<p>I guess, the knowledge and understanding of Emacs will grow over time. The trick is to keep at it. It is overwhelming how much I don’t know about Emacs.</p>
<h2 id="focus-on-new-window">Focus on New Window</h2>
<p>I am trying to move away from tabs and rely on windows to move between files. I think I will end up using a combination of the two. There are some files which I need to be open and easily accessible. For instance, the diary file and the todo file. These can be two tabs. The third tab can be where I open windows, switch to a buffer, work on it, and then delete the window when I am done.</p>
<p>I ran into a problem with windows. When you open a new window, the focus of the cursor stays on the original buffer. Doesn’t make sense to me, but that is the default behavior. I wanted the focus to shift to the window that I just created.</p>
<p>I got the solution from <a href="https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d/blob/master/config.org/" target="_blank">Terencio Agozzino</a>.</p>
<pre><code>#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package window
    :ensure nil
    :preface
    (defun hsplit-last-buffer ()
      "Focus to the last created horizontal window."
      (interactive)
      (split-window-horizontally)
      (other-window 1))
    (defun vsplit-last-buffer ()
      "Focus to the last created vertical window."
      (interactive)
      (split-window-vertically)
      (other-window 1)))
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-1") #'delete-other-windows)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-2") #'vsplit-last-buffer)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-3") #'hsplit-last-buffer)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-0") #'delete-window)
#+end_src</code></pre>
<p>Much better.</p>
<h2 id="balanced-vs.-golden-ratio">Balanced vs.&nbsp;Golden Ratio</h2>
<p>My configuration included the following:</p>
<pre><code>#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package balanced-windows
  :config
  (balanced-windows-mode))
#+end_src</code></pre>
<p>This meant that new windows were roughly the same size as the existing window. It was working fine but I found an alternative.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el" target="_blank">romangolden-ratio.el Automatic resizing of Emacs windows to the golden ratio</a> made sure that the new window was the main focus and had a much bigger size than the original window. I like it. This is the code I am using for it.</p>
<pre><code>#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package golden-ratio)
(golden-ratio-mode 1)
#+end_src</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://daily.baty.net/posts/2024/11/23.html" target="_blank">Jack Baty</a> has a warning about the golden-ratio package. I have been using it for a couple of weeks with no problems, but you might want to be careful.</p>
<h2 id="showing-folders-in-a-dired-buffer-on-the-top">Showing Folders in a Dired Buffer on the Top</h2>
<p>I wanted the dired buffer to show folders at the top of the listing. <a href="https://protesilaos.com/" target="_blank">Protesilaos Stavrou’s</a> configuration comes to the rescue.</p>
<pre><code>#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dired-listing-switches
        "-AGFhlv --group-directories-first --time-style=long-iso")
#+end_src</code></pre>
<h2 id="scratch-buffers-in-org-mode-or-markdown-mode">Scratch buffers in org-mode or markdown-mode</h2>
<p>When I am working in my Emacs.org configuration file, I want a scratch buffer in org-mode to try out some things. I also want a markdown-mode buffer when I am writing in Markdown. This is the package which lets me do that.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeberg.org/emacs-weirdware/scratch" target="_blank">emacs-weirdwarescratch Mode-specific scratch buffers - Codeberg.org</a></p>
<p>The relevant code:</p>
<pre><code>#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package scratch)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") 'scratch)
#+end_src</code></pre>
<h2 id="updates">Updates:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Still using god-mode. I am liking it.</li>
<li>Using consult-notes but considering moving to org-roam.</li>
<li>Reading the org-mode manual. Org-mode is the main reason I switched to Emacs. Would be nice to be able to use this well.</li>
<li>I have expressed the intention to stop tweaking Emacs and concentrate on using the features I know about. Not going to happen. Emacs is a wet-dream for anyone interesting in tinkering with their environment. I am, apparently one of them. The more I get exposed to different things about Emacs, the more I find myself incorporating those into my configuration and giving it a go. At this stage, it is endless tinkering.</li>
