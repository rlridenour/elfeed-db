<p>Hong Kong has elected a new 90-seat Legislative Council in its first citywide vote since a November apartment blaze killed at least 159 people, with officials working to boost participation amid public anger over safety and accountability. About 31.9% of registered voters cast ballots, slightly above the record low of 30.2% in 2021 but well below the more than half of voters who participated in pre-2021 elections before Beijing reshaped the system to ensure that only candidates deemed &quot;patriots&quot; could run or win most seats. The government mounted an extensive get-out-the-vote campaign, including free public transport and door-to-door outreach in estates affected by the fire, while also warning foreign media against coverage that might, in its view, provoke unrest over the disaster. Critics and some residents, however, saw the muted participation and reduced voter rolls as signs of discontent with both the fire response and the tightly controlled electoral framework, even as authorities presented the result as evidence of continued public support for the current governance model.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DIxa4HBSOGMgwSytvYSQFv_GWfw-wH0uOL_2uBKcMfbGW48C8jfAsE9GvMM1A82ixIFcNbZA7zHTvGcW1ogm8GklNzGUOGmEVsCZYRv2NBD2_vPoVIKOHnNgDc0rxV_Y2MZ6ALmsjlXgGLpVd0Vh-_M8ATuInP1BOkJkDh30LIvPWTtWs_hUbKETGhhNCwmliBfUZbfqjJmlF0jUGR1Mpnfs3pF4YqjocYifwWD2teiuCYWG4poaT5Mi2a7ioRkRmM_WEb7slNK-hwVOkA' alt='Candidates celebrate after winning seats in Hong Kong&#x27;s Legislative Council election.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Reworked electoral system: Under the current framework introduced after 2021, most Legislative Council seats are either chosen by vetted committees or tightly screened to ensure only &quot;patriots&quot; can stand, significantly limiting the scope for opposition candidates compared with earlier competitive races.</li><li>Government turnout push: Authorities offered free rides on public transport, mobilized civil servants, and staged high-profile appeals by senior officials in the days before the vote in an effort to encourage participation despite widespread mourning and anger after the Wang Fuk Court blaze.</li><li>Fire-related safety concerns: Residents and commentators have questioned why fire safety and building management problems persisted at the Wang Fuk Court complex, which became the site of Hong Kong&#x27;s worst blaze in decades, prompting calls for clearer accountability mechanisms.</li><li>Media warning issued: Ahead of polling day, officials delivered an unusual notice to foreign correspondents cautioning them against disaster coverage that the government suggested might inflame public sentiment over the fire and affect social stability.</li><li>Shifts in voter rolls: This election took place after the number of registered voters had fallen for four consecutive years, meaning that even with a marginally higher participation rate than in 2021, the absolute number of people casting ballots still declined compared with that earlier poll.</li></ul><blockquote>We hope to turn grief into strength and rebuild trust through this election - Unnamed senior Hong Kong official (as reported)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Hong Kong government: Officials framed the election as a chance for residents to channel their grief from the Wang Fuk Court fire into participation and to show confidence in the &quot;patriots governing Hong Kong&quot; framework.
