<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is still reeling from the last-week’s news that the most
compelling new Apple Intelligence features for Siri have been
indefinitely delayed. Over the weekend, it <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/07/apple-pulls-ad-that-showed-siri-being-useful-after-delaying-feature-that-could-make-siri-useful/">pulled a YouTube
ad</a> showcasing personal context running on the iPhone 16. Now,
it has updated the Apple website with a new disclaimer wherever
the unreleased Siri features are mentioned on the iPhone marketing
pages. [...]</p>

<p>The new message to customers found on Apple’s website is
different, but equally as vague. It reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Siri’s personal context understanding, onscreen awareness, and
in-app actions are in development and will be available with a
future software update.</p>
