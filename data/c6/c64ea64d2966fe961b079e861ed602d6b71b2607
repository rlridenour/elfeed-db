<p>Dr. Drang:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For weeks — maybe months, time has been hard to judge this past
year — Trump has been telling us that he’s worked out deals with
pharmaceutical companies to lower their prices by several hundred
percent. Commentators and comedians have pointed out that you
can’t reduce prices more than 100% and pretty much left it at
that, suggesting that Trump’s impossible numbers are due to
ignorance.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. Trump’s ignorance is nearly limitless — but
only nearly. I’ve always thought that he knew the right way to
calculate a price drop; he did it the wrong way so he could quote
a bigger number. And that came out in yesterday’s speech.</p>

<p>Trump sophistry + math pedantry = Daring Fireball catnip.</p>
