<p>Myanmar has completed the third and final phase of a month-long general election, with the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party widely expected to win by a large margin. Voting did not take place in many areas affected by fighting, and multiple reports say numerous parties were barred while Aung San Suu Kyi’s party has been dissolved, leaving critics to argue the process favors the military’s allies. Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, who has suggested he could become president after the vote, cast the election as a route to stability and a return to civilian rule, even as conflict continued during the polling period.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/TBpWZpUSP8mi4n9XMekD5GTV3pWPSSGoxNCkU3E_DpH-NAEqppfStbVguTlOf_qM9bYDZZ6VbT4djc7yhhB8ohJpAjuRp7z1qFbehXtr7TNS' alt='A voter casts his ballot during the third and final phase of Myanmar’s general election in Mandalay on Jan 25, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Turnout footprint: Several outlets report that roughly half the country did not vote, with polling absent in areas outside junta control amid the civil war.</li><li>Mandalay scenes: AFP reporting carried by Dawn described early-morning voting at a Mandalay high school and quoted a teacher saying he voted hoping for “a better country,” even while expecting little change.</li><li>Military branding: Dawn reported Min Aung Hlaing toured Mandalay polling stations wearing civilian dress, a detail that underscores the junta’s effort to present the ballot as a civilian transition.</li><li>Critics’ claims: Rights monitors cited in Dawn said the run-up in junta-held areas featured coercion and a crackdown on dissent, while The Guardian described international denunciations of the vote.</li><li>Earlier precedent: Dawn noted the USDP previously won more than 85% in an earlier election, and described the party as filled with retired officers and viewed by analysts as a military proxy.</li></ul><blockquote>This is the path chosen by the people - Min Aung Hlaing</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Myanmar junta (Min Aung Hlaing): The junta leader rejected criticism and framed the vote as reflecting public support and a return to democracy and stability, saying people can back whoever they want.
