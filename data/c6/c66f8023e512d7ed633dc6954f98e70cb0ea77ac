<p>A new iPhone accessory available in the U.S. Apple Store prioritizes accessibility for users with a variety of physical and motor disabilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/goto/hikawagrip">The Hikawa MagSafe Phone Grip and Stand</a> functions as both a stand for the phone, and a tool for gripping it, for users with limited muscle strength or ability to hold a phone independently.</p>
<p>The silicone grip and stand snaps onto any MagSafe-capable iPhone, and works in portrait or landscape mode. It’s available in chartreuse and crater – a recycled colorway exclusive to Apple’s U.S. Online Store.</p>
<p>The grip and stand was created by Bailey Hikawa, a Los Angeles-based designer who has also designed iPhone cases. It sells for $69.95.</p>
