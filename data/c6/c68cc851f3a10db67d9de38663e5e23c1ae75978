Multiple sources have claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-visionos-redesign-rumors/">iOS 19 will introduce a new design</a> with more translucent buttons, menus, notification banners, and more, and there is now another clue that points towards this glass-like appearance.<br/>

A solarium is a room with glass walls that allow in plenty of sunlight, so this codename further hints at iOS 19 having a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-19-visionos-like-design-rumors/">"glass-like" appearance</a> with translucent interfaces. The new design is expected to look similar to visionOS for the Apple Vision Pro.<br/>

Jon Prosser has shared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">alleged renders of iOS 19's Camera</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/ios-19-messages-app-mockup/">Messages apps</a> on his YouTube channel Front Page Tech, and both apps have more translucent designs. However, there is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/gurman-ios-19-mockups-not-accurate/">some debate over the extent of the design changes</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman previously claimed that iOS 19 could have the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">biggest design changes since iOS 7</a> introduced a much flatter appearance in 2013.<br/>
