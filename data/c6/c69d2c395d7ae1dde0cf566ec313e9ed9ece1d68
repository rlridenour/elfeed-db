<p>China’s Defense Ministry said Central Military Commission vice chairman Gen. Zhang Youxia and Joint Staff Department chief Gen. Liu Zhenli are under investigation for suspected “serious violations of discipline and law,” marking a fresh escalation in Beijing’s military anti-graft drive. Chinese state-linked messaging described the case as tied to safeguarding the Communist Party’s “absolute leadership” over the People’s Liberation Army and protecting Xi Jinping’s authority. Analysts cited in multiple reports say the swift action signals an intensified political-discipline campaign at the top of the armed forces ahead of major political moments next year. For outside observers, the move raises near-term questions about continuity inside China’s military command while underscoring Beijing’s emphasis on internal control and compliance.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/XpIrhlVyVxkCDVYz6M-IZNiOcVhShsKlPzADVbN6rJ4oWSBv3ZYHddiFGchDL6-6Jf2y-CBWmJVDS7iWQIAzs4UhUCBh77BmwbemCKsW9dCWj0TZU9hnZdOmYb4gkfclwYidj1Am7tzTqzusZXF3jxsiS5LVh4P8ihS6--zghYjBd7PNO4gxp2HYPPYK_ODLglhdSLQOSVGA8g' alt='Gen.
