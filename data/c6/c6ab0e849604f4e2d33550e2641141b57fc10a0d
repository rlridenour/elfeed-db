<h2 id="tldr">TLDR;</h2>
<p><code>service</code> is less functional wrapper around <code>systemctl</code> command on systemd based distros.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a long time Linux user and got a habit to start/stop things using <code>service</code> command.</p>
<p>I never really thought about what exactly it does. I mean, I know I can start Apache or something else with it and it&rsquo;s something related to init system of my distro.
Usually when you install Apache or PHP-FPM those things become recognizable by <code>service</code> command and you can call <code>service program start</code> when you want to start a service.</p>
<p>I never really needed to write my own init scripts so I successfully skipped any knowledge related to init systems of various distros I used.</p>
<p>Today I was reading <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/">Fedora Manual for Administrators</a> and there are lot of stuff written about systemd and its insisted to use <code>systemctl</code> command. Why is that if <code>service</code> works too.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s close this question.</p>
<p>Turned out <code>systemctl</code> is part of <code>systemd</code> package/program/init-system. And this is the tool to use when you want to interact with <code>systemd</code>.</p>
<p><code>service</code> on the other hand is a script that allows you to start/stop other scripts defined in <code>/etc/init.d</code> folder which was used by other init-systems in the past.</p>
<p>Most systemd-based distros provide <code>service</code> command for backward compatibility.
At first this command is going to look into <code>/etc/init.d</code> folder and if no service found there then it will try to use <code>systemctl</code>.</p>
<p><code>service</code> command doesn&rsquo;t support all possible arguments supported by <code>systemctl</code>.</p>
<p>So if you consciously decided to use systemd then you definitely should use <code>systemctl</code> because it is the command that allows you to interact with <code>systemd</code> services.
<code>service</code> command behaves like proxy to <code>systemctl</code>. Of course it behaves like proxy only if you don&rsquo;t use <code>/etc/init.d</code> for your daemons which you probably shouldn&rsquo;t do on systemd based system.</p>
