<p id="p2"><a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/welcome-to-the-new-unified-macstories-and-club-macstories/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The new unified MacStories website is here</a>, bringing <a href="https://www.macstories.net/club/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Club MacStories</a> content under the same roof as the rest of the site for the first time. While this transition delivers a more cohesive experience for members, a few things are different and others are still being implemented.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-re-subscribe-to-your-rss-feeds">How to Re-Subscribe to Your RSS Feeds</h2>
<p id="p3"><a href="https://www.macstories.net/plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Club MacStories+ and Premier members</a> have access to custom feeds as part of their subscriptions. With today’s update, you’ll need to resubscribe to those feeds. The old ones will no longer work. Here’s what to do.</p>
<ol id="ol4"><li><a href="https://macstories.net/my-feeds/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit My Feeds</a> from the Account dropdown on macstories.net.</li>
<li>Copy the feed URL.</li>
<li>Paste it into your RSS reader to subscribe.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: Club Premier members will also need to do this for <a href="https://www.macstories.net/podcasts/appstories-plus/" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStories+</a>.</li>
</ol><p id="p5">These new feeds are personal to you and will continue to work going forward as long as you maintain your Club membership. Since these feeds are uniquely tied to your paid Club account, please don’t share them publicly.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-discord-access">A Note on Discord Access</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2026-01-28-at-15-34-57-2x-1769632516634.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p7">If you’re a Club MacStories+ or Premier member who joined before today’s transition, your Discord access remains intact. There’s nothing you need to do.</p>
<p id="p8">New or returning members who want to join the Discord community will need to wait just a bit longer. We are working with Memberful engineers to migrate users from our previous system. Once that process is complete, we’ll provide you with instructions to connect your Discord account from MacStories.</p>
<h2 id="coming-soon-features-in-development">Coming Soon: Features in Development</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2026-01-28-at-16-02-37-2x-1769634177375.png" alt="Find a bug on the new site? You can submit it [here](https://giant-smash-219.notion.site/2f635e3fe8d8805a91dae6d2824dd997?pvs=105)."><p class="image-caption">Find a bug on the new site?

<p id="p10">The launch of the new site required some tough decisions about which features to prioritize. Three capabilities from the previous Club website aren’t available yet but are actively being worked on for future updates.</p>
<ol id="ol11"><li>The Explore interface, which allowed members to search Club MacStories content using visual filters, hasn’t made the transition yet. </li>
<li>The ability to generate unique RSS feeds for specific sections of the Club isn’t currently supported, though you can still subscribe to RSS feeds for entire newsletter issues as detailed above. </li>
<li>The real-time search autocomplete suggestions that appeared as you typed in the search box are temporarily unavailable.</li>
</ol><p id="p12">These features are coming back. However, the priority was on delivering a functional, unified experience now rather than continuing to maintain a fragmented system, while we waited for every legacy feature to be rebuilt.</p>
<p id="p13">We hope you enjoy the new Club experience on MacStories. The transition to a unified website is a significant step forward for the Club and greater MacStories community that will allow us to do more for everyone in the future. Thanks for bearing with us during this transition, and please feel free to get in touch with any questions or <a href="https://giant-smash-219.notion.site/2f635e3fe8d8805a91dae6d2824dd997?pvs=105" rel="noopener noreferrer">bug reports</a>.</p>
