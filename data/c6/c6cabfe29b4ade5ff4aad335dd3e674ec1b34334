<p>That&#8217;s &#8220;Gwen&#8221;, a student at Yale, interviewed for an article by Alex Moore in <em><a href="https://thenewjournalatyale.com/2025/10/inside-yales-quiet-reckoning-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Journal</a> </em>about how students and professors at Yale are grappling with the use of AI.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some context for the above quote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>In the fall of her sophomore year, Gwen began falling far behind in all of her classes. She struggled to prepare for tests, and forgot deadlines until the last minute or missed them altogether. It was a “sophomore slump,” she said. Too embarrassed to seek out her professors or peers for help, Gwen turned to ChatGPT. (She asked to be referred to by a nickname to speak openly about her artificial intelligence use, out of fear of disciplinary action.) By the end of the semester, she was using it to help complete many of her assignments.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>By last spring, her struggles had only worsened. In a philosophy seminar—“my favorite class I’ve taken so far,” she said—Gwen used AI to write almost all her essays just to avoid late submissions. With AI, Gwen could hide her struggles from friends and professors. She never told them she was using AI. On rare occasions, when her friends saw she was falling behind, Gwen said they would joke: “Oh, your essay’s due tomorrow? Just use ChatGPT.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>AI helped Gwen turn her philosophy papers in on time. But guilt, she said, “was just eating me alive.” She felt that she was deceiving her professors and betraying the purpose of her education. “If I’m using AI instead of doing the work myself, why am I here?”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>When her professor emailed her feedback on an AI-written paper, she refused to open it. She still hasn’t. “It’s wasting his time because he’s editing a fucking machine,” Gwen said. “Whatever he has to say is meaningless to me anyway, because it’s not my writing.”</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, some professors are trying to understand what their students are up to. Math professor John Hall is quoted as saying, &#8220;I don’t think people are trying to get by and not learn. But I think they don’t realize in the moment what they’re learning or not learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others &#8220;expressed sadness or frustration,&#8221; such as philosophy professor Shelly Kagan: &#8220;Yale offers you this astonishing opportunity to stretch your brain. If you want to just waste your time [by using AI], then you’re an idiot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe professors conveying that message can make a difference at the margins to certain kinds of students (at least for a time&#8212;who knows what educating the kids who grew up with AI will be like?).</p>
<p>Moore writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>By the end of the spring semester, Gwen reached a breaking point with AI. “I felt like I didn’t deserve to be a Yale student,” she said. She thought that she was throwing away her education and the scholarship paying to support it. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>She decided to quit using ChatGPT altogether. She didn’t ask AI to help her sentences flow or to strike the right tone. She didn’t even use it to brainstorm. “I think that’s a skill you need to have on your own. That’s the core of being original, anyway.” </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Gwen recalled completing her final assignments without AI, sitting in the middle of a crowded library so that she felt watched. “I struggled. And they weren’t very good.” </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>It was only then, she said, that she started to understand just how much learning she had missed out on.</em></p>
<p>Of course, Yale students are hardly representative of the average college student (and Yale is hardly representative of the average university). Good for Gwen, but her revelation doesn&#8217;t make for much of a feel good story.</p>
<p>When the takeaway is <em>finally, a gifted and morally sensitive student at a top university realizes that cheating is bad for her</em>, what hope should we have for everyone else?</p>
