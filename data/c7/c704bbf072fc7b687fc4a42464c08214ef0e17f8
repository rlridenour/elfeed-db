<p>U.S. and Iranian officials held indirect talks in Muscat, Oman on Friday focused on Iran’s nuclear program, and both sides signaled they plan to keep negotiating as early as next week. President Trump called the talks “very good,” while also warning of “very steep” consequences if Tehran does not reach a deal. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, described the discussions as a “good start” in a “positive” atmosphere, but said progress hinges on decisions in Washington and Tehran—and that talks should move forward without threats. The diplomacy comes amid heightened tension. These were the first talks since the U.S. joined Israel’s war with Iran last June, striking Iranian nuclear sites. Shortly after the Muscat session ended, Washington announced fresh sanctions aimed at Iran’s oil and petrochemical trade, and President Trump also signed an executive order laying the groundwork for “secondary” tariffs on countries that keep doing business with Iran. Even so, the fact that the two rivals spent hours in structured talks—and agreed to keep the channel open—offers a modest but real note of hope that dialogue can still compete with escalation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/r0W-1Mdhg8vkiAawajCg229xykk9XfOMeMRzy8Kh-_sgUha0kZQ_V9zw1w64JiO7wx7GL4b0YoKGXBIDMBAlklVOxFR82tgJ4V46A9KBxPmJ' alt='Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and his delegation depart for the talks site in Muscat, Oman, Feb. 6, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Agenda dispute: Iran’s side said the Muscat talks dealt exclusively with the nuclear file, while U.S. officials pushed to broaden discussions to issues such as ballistic missiles, support for militant groups, and Iran’s handling of protests.</li><li>Enrichment red line: A regional diplomat briefed by Tehran said Iran ruled out a U.S. demand to end uranium enrichment, highlighting a key gap heading into follow-on meetings.</li><li>Missile signal: Dawn reported that Iran unveiled the Khorramshahr-4 ballistic missile hours before the meeting, widely read as a pointed message as talks resumed.</li><li>Military at table: The Globe and Mail reported that the U.S. brought its top military commander in the Middle East into the Oman process, an unusual step alongside the diplomatic track.</li><li>Consular warning: Dawn reported the U.S. told its citizens to leave Iran even as the Oman channel reopened, a reminder of how high tensions remain around the talks.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iran (Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi): Araghchi called the meeting a “good start” in a “positive atmosphere,” said both sides must overcome a “wall of mistrust,” and argued negotiations should drop threats and pressure while staying confined to the nuclear issue.
