<p>Right on schedule: second Tuesday of September, so long as that second Tuesday doesn’t fall on September 11. (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/26/apple-event-glowtime">Last year’s event</a> went on Monday 9 September, probably because the Harris-Trump debate was already scheduled for Tuesday the 10th.) There’s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/26/apple-event-2025-interactive-logo/">an interactive animated version</a> of the “heat map” event logo on <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple’s homepage</a>. (A little bit odd that the second item below the event announcement, after a back-to-school promotion, is a “Meet the iPhone 16 family” promotion.)</p>

<p>Expected announcements for this event include:</p>

<ul>
<li>iPhones 17 (regular, Pro, Air)</li>
<li>Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3</li>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/25/airpods-pro-3-coming-this-fall-heres-what-we-know/">AirPods Pro 3</a></li>
</ul>
