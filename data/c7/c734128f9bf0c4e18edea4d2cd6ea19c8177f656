<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s remotely familiar with how electronics are built knows a US-made phone is not feasible, at least not in the time span of the current administration, but 404 media&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.404media.co/author/jason-koebler/">Jason Koebler</a> wrote a <a href="https://www.404media.co/a-us-made-iphone-is-pure-fantasy/">pretty thorough article explaining why</a>.</p>

<p>This is behind a paywall, so I&rsquo;ll sum up the three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>No workforce (not enough American workers are trained for this job, and they&rsquo;d cost too much anyway)</li>
<li>No materials (Apple&rsquo;s supply chain lists roughly lists 80 different countries)</li>
<li>No Factories (the machines for these factories are also manufactured overseas)</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the quotes I liked in this article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Reshoring Institute put out a paper that said American machine operators made an average of $43,000 annually in 2022; Vietnamese machine operators made less than $5,000 annually.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Factories require machinery and components from other countries, so if machinery gets really expensive you’re going to have less manufacturing, not more. So I think this is very unlikely to yield the results that they want.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is also worth considering that Foxconn, which manufactures iPhones and other devices, got billions of dollars of funding to build a factory in Wisconsin, failed to do so, and totally abandoned the site. Foxconn failed in Wisconsin for many reasons (chief among them, it did not ever actually build a factory, which was covered best by The Verge), but an executive there explained that it was not feasible for the company to find workers only from the local communities: “It is not feasible to tap into just Mount Pleasant or Milwaukee alone to really build up the talent pool,” Alan Yeung, who helped lead the Foxconn project, told The Verge.</p>

<p>The quote below is from a <a href="https://www.404media.co/how-a-2-000-made-in-the-usa-liberty-phone-phone-is-manufacture">different article by Jason, interviewing the CEO of a company that&rsquo;s trying to make a 100% US-built phone</a>, but it highlights the material problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One specific item is a type of crystal that needs to be put into phones, which is basically for keeping track of time and a few other measurement metrics. That crystal is something that only comes from China, and maybe I think you can get it from South Korea, which is where we either are sourcing or trying to source that last component from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, the phone, <a href="https://puri.sm/products/liberty-phone/#tech-specs">Liberty Phone by Purism</a>, is a $2000 Android device with mid-specs that cannot compete with phones less than half its price. And It&rsquo;s still not entirely made in the US.</p>
