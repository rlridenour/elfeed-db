<p>Paul Tenorio of The Athletic reports that Apple and MLS are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6804777/2025/11/13/mls-apple-tv-end-paywall-season-pass/">putting all MLS games on the standard Apple TV subscription</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  MLS and Apple have agreed to alter the partnership agreement at the end of the 2025 season, multiple sources told The Athletic. MLS Season Pass will no longer exist, and all MLS games will be available on the Apple TV streaming service. (Apple rebranded Apple TV+ to Apple TV.)</p>
<p>  It’s an important change for the MLS-Apple deal, which put every MLS game behind a paywall that cost fans for $14.99 per month or $99 for the season. While the streaming service provided a far better broadcast experience than the local TV deals for diehard MLS fans, it also made it much more difficult for the league to reach new fans.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This mirrors Apple’s recent <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/apple-strikes-five-year-deal-for-formula-1-rights/">deal with F1</a>, which will also be available to all Apple TV subscribers. It enhances the value of the base Apple TV service and broadens the potential audience for MLS games.</p>
<p>In related news, Tenorio reports that MLS is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6804752/2025/11/13/mls-calendar-fall-spring-europe-schedule-format-owners-vote/">rejiggering its season schedule</a> to play through the winter beginning in 2027, matching international soccer leagues:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The plan is for the MLS regular season to span from the middle of July to April, with playoffs staged in May. A winter break would take place in December and January. Games would likely pause from around the second week in December through the first or third week in February. MLS understandably is trying to avoid restarting the league on Super Bowl weekend.
</p></blockquote>
<p>These are both interesting moves that could improve viewership and interest in the league as North America prepares to host the 2026 World Cup.</p>
