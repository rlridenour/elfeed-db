<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>In this moment of turbulent policy change, The Phi Beta Kappa Society and the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) remain steadfast and nonpartisan voices championing education in the liberal arts and sciences as essential public good. For nearly half a century, the Department of Education has been critical in ensuring robust funding for colleges and universities nationwide and safeguarding student financial aid necessary to access colleges and universities. Dismantling of the Department of Education will result in catastrophic implications for students, faculty, communities, and the nation.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The Phi Beta Kappa Society and ACLS urge the administration to rescind the Executive Order calling for the dismantling of the Department of Education. </em></p>
