Apple today launched a <a href="https://support.apple.com/mac-mini-2023-service-program-for-no-power-issue">repair program</a> for Mac mini models with the M2 chip, after it determined that a "very small percentage" of these computers may no longer power on. No other Mac mini models are part of this program.<br/>

If your Mac mini has exhibited this issue, you can enter its serial number <a href="https://support.apple.com/mac-mini-2023-service-program-for-no-power-issue">on Apple's website</a> to see if it is eligible for this program. If it is, Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will provide service, free of charge.<br/>
<br/>
Mac mini models with the M2 chip were first released in 2023, but Apple says that affected units were manufactured between June 16 and November 23 of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
The worldwide program covers an eligible Mac mini for up to three years after it was purchased.<br/>
