Apple today added the first-generation iPhone SE to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">obsolete products list</a>, meaning the device is no longer eligible for repairs, battery replacements, or any other service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers worldwide.<br/>

Apple considers a product to be obsolete once seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. The original iPhone SE was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/09/12/apple-discontinues-iphone-se-iphone-6s-iphone-x/">discontinued in September 2018</a>, so the device recently crossed that seven-year mark.<br/>
<br/>
The original iPhone SE was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/21/apple-announces-4-inch-iphone-se-starting-399/">released in March 2016</a>. The device's design is largely based on the iPhone 5s, with key specs including a 4-inch display, a Touch ID home button, and an aluminum and glass frame with chamfered edges. However, the original iPhone SE is powered by a newer A9 chip from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.<br/>

"Everyone who wants a smaller phone is going to love iPhone SE," said Apple's former marketing chief Phil Schiller, in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/03/21Apple-Introduces-iPhone-SE-The-Most-Powerful-Phone-with-a-Four-inch-Display/">press release</a> announcing the device.<br/>
<br/>
Apple went on to release second-generation and third-generation iPhone SE models in April 2020 and March 2022, respectively, with both of those devices having a similar design as the iPhone 8. In February 2025, the iPhone SE was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-discontinues-iphone-se/">entirely discontinued</a> for the foreseeable future, after it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/">effectively replaced by the iPhone 16e</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/first-generation-iphone-se-obsolete/">Apple Says Original iPhone SE is Now &#039;Obsolete&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-original-iphone-se-is-now-obsolete.2473527/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
