<p>Finally got around to updating this blog to support <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme">OS appearance changes</a>. Pleasantly surprised that the CSS was not difficult to figure out nor that much  to do. Looking at my Org <code>TODO</code> timestamp for this task, it was back in<code>[2023-10-26 Thu 15:20]</code>when I really wanted this to happen. Better late than never, I suppose.</p>
<p>Side note - Mobile Safari (both iPhone and iPad) is stubborn in not refreshing updated CSS files. To force this, go to Settings › Apps › Safari › Advanced › Website Data. When there do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for yummymelon.com</li>
<li>Press the <code>Edit</code> button.</li>
<li>Delete yummymelon.com data.</li>
<li>Press the <code>Done</code> button.</li>
<li>Kill running Safari app (Swipe up, Select Safari, Swipe Up).</li>
<li>Restart Safari.</li>
<li>Open <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/">http://yummymelon.com/devnull/</a>.</li>
</ol>
