<p>I've been lucky to have enjoyed healthy vision throughout my life. That is, until recently. Nothing major, I'll need glasses for some activities. I also learned from the optometrist I should follow the <a href="https://www.sbs.nhs.uk/information/home-working-looking-after-eyes">20-20-20 rule</a> to reduce eye strain.</p>
<p>The <strong>20-20-20 rule</strong> is simple:</p>
<p>Take a break from looking at your computer screen every <strong>20 minutes</strong> and look away at something roughly <strong>20 feet away</strong> (6 metres) for <strong>20 seconds</strong>.</p>
<p>While there are no shortages of macOS timer apps available, I figured it'd be fun to build a 20-20-20 one anyway.</p>
<p>Meet <strong>Fresh Eyes</strong>. I've been using it in the last few days. If you'd like to give it a try, send me an email at me@xenodium.com and I'll reply with a TestFlight invite.</p>
