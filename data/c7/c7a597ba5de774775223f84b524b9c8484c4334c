Actors of old wore masks <br></br>
to hide their true selves, <br></br>
with smiles and frowns <br></br>
frozen into place. <br></br> <br></br>
They wore expressions, <br></br>
not of who they really were, <br></br>
but of who someone thought they should be.
 <br></br>
We call our masks <br></br>
by different names: <br></br>
Facebook, <br></br>
Twitter, <br></br>
Social media; <br></br>
still used to <br></br>
project an image, <br></br>
one that even we ourselves <br></br>
can eventually come to believe.
 <br></br>
Lord Jesus, you summed up the law and <br></br>
the prophets in one simple statement: <br></br>
do to others what you would <br></br>
want them to do to you.
 <br></br>
But how can I do that <br></br>
if I cannot face who I really am?
 <br></br>
Holy Spirit, cleanse me of <br></br>
the sin of self-deception <br></br>
and open my eyes to <br></br>
who I truly am <br></br>
and what I truly want, <br></br>
that I may truly serve.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
