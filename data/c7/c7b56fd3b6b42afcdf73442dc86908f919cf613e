It has been rumored that a new Apple TV will launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/">later this year</a>, and it might support the faster Wi-Fi 7 standard.<br/>

All four iPhone 17 models coming later this year will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-17-series-apple-wifi-7-chip/">equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip</a>, according to Apple supply chain analysts Ming-Chi Kuo and Jeff Pu. A new Apple TV is also expected to be released this year, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/">will also have an Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
This means the next Apple TV should support Wi-Fi 7, unless Apple chooses to artificially limit the device's specifications.<br/>
<br/>
The current Apple TV 4K model from 2022 supports Wi-Fi 6, and the higher-end model also has an Ethernet port for wired internet.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that Gurman said the Wi-Fi chip that he reported on would support Wi-Fi 6E at a minimum, but it seems unlikely that Apple is developing separate Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 chips, especially considering that all iPhone 17 models already support Wi-Fi 7 with some limitations. All in all, Wi-Fi 7 seems more likely.<br/>
<br/>
Wi-Fi 7 allows for data transmission over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously, with a compatible router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. Wi-Fi 7 can provide peak speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E, provided a device supports the maximum specifications.<br/>
