A little more than three months ago, <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a> discovered references to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-all-the-little-changes/">unreleased "Weather via satellite" feature</a> in the code for the first iOS 26 developer beta. However, just one day before iOS 26 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/14/ios-26-available-tomorrow/">set to be widely released</a>, the feature has yet to be released or even announced by Apple.<br/>

The references have not been removed from the code, as of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-seeds-ios-26-rc/">iOS 26 Release Candidate</a>, so it is possible that Apple will introduce the feature eventually. Perhaps the feature will be added in a follow-up update, such as iOS 26.1 or iOS 26.2.<br/>
<br/>
The feature would let you view the forecast and other weather information in the Weather app, in supported areas without Wi-Fi and cellular range. Apple's other satellite features include Emergency SOS via satellite, Messages via satellite, Find My via satellite, and Roadside Assistance via satellite, with availability varying by country.<br/>

Apple has yet to charge a fee for any of its satellite features. Last week, the company announced it is providing existing iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 users with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-extends-free-satellite-features/">additional year of free access</a> to the entire suite of satellite features on those devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-satellite-features/">iPhone Satellite Features</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/weather/">Apple Weather</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/14/apple-weather-via-satellite-still-missing/">Apple&#039;s Weather via Satellite Feature in iOS 26 Beta Code is Still Missing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-weather-via-satellite-feature-in-ios-26-beta-code-is-still-missing.2465741/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
