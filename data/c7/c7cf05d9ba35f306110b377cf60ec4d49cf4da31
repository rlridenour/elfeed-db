<p>French President Emmanuel Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping wrapped up a three-day state visit in China by pledging closer cooperation on global crises, including the war in Ukraine, as well as on trade and climate issues. Macron used the talks to urge Xi to leverage China’s relationship with Russia to help move towards a political solution in Ukraine, while both leaders called for respect for international law and opposed attacks on civilians and nuclear facilities. The visit also highlighted economic concerns, with Macron pressing for more balanced market access for European and French firms and for Beijing to address European worries about industrial overcapacity. The trip ended on an unusually warm, informal note as Xi accompanied Macron to Chengdu, where the French leader visited cultural sites, met table tennis stars and, alongside his wife Brigitte, engaged in panda diplomacy at a local research centre.</p><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>EU presidency role: France is preparing to take over the rotating presidency of the Group of Seven (G7) in 2025, and Macron framed his talks with Xi as part of a broader effort to coordinate on global governance and reform of international institutions ahead of that role.</li><li>Chengdu side trip: Xi’s decision to accompany Macron to Chengdu, far from the usual confines of Beijing, was described by French officials as a rare break with protocol that underscores Beijing’s desire to cultivate ties with Paris and, by extension, the wider European Union.</li><li>Panda cooperation: Brigitte Macron visited a giant panda research centre in Chengdu, where discussions touched on ongoing scientific and cultural cooperation around panda conservation, a long-standing symbol of China’s diplomatic outreach to partner countries.</li><li>Sports diplomacy: Macron’s Chengdu programme included a meeting with a leading Chinese table tennis duo, using China’s hugely popular sport as a friendly setting to showcase people-to-people links beyond the formal summitry in Beijing.</li><li>Historic dam visit: The French delegation toured an ancient irrigation and dam system near Chengdu, highlighting environmental and heritage themes at the close of a visit that had focused heavily on modern trade frictions and geopolitical tensions.</li></ul><blockquote>I was very touched by this gesture - Emmanuel Macron</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Emmanuel Macron: Macron urged Xi to use China’s channels with Moscow to help build conditions for a negotiated peace in Ukraine and stressed that any settlement must respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and international law.
