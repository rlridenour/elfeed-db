It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS after releasing an update. Software that is not signed cannot be installed on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; due to a server-side verification check, and it keeps &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users from installing outdated versions of iOS. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models compatible with &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; are only eligible to download and run iOS 18.3.2 at this time.<br/>
<br/>
By preventing customers from installing older versions of iOS or downgrading, Apple ensures that devices have the latest security improvements.<br/>
