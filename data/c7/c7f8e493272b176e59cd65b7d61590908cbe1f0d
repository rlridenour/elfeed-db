By 2030, Apple said it plans to match 100% of the electricity that all customers use to power and charge their Apple devices with clean electricity, by helping to bring new wind and solar power developments online around the world.<br/>
<br/>
In Europe, this includes new solar and wind farms in development in Greece, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Spain, according to Apple. And in China, Apple said over 90% of its manufacturing in the country is now powered by renewable energy.<br/>
