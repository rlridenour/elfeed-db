Citing supposedly verifiable supply chain information, the Weibo user known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>" says that Apple has tested a flip-style foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Such a device would compete with devices such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> and the <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/family/razr2025">modern-day Motorola Razr</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The rumored flip-device comes in addition to the wide foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that is expected to launch later this year. Whether the flip-style foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will reach mass production is apparently yet to be decided.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/01/apple-is-exploring-an-iphone-flip/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple is "exploring" the idea of a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a "square, clamshell-style" design.<br/>
<br/>
The clamshell &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; would be released at some point after Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">first foldable iPhone</a>, which is expected to open up like a book, similar to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. This design will provide users with a large inner display for watching videos and gaming, and there will likely be multitasking functionality. A clamshell &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, on the other hand, would be more about portability and pocketability.<br/>
<br/>
Other rumors suggest that Apple's first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will feature a 7.8-inch crease-free inner display, a 5.5-inch cover display, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, two rear cameras, the A20 chip, and the "C2" modem. It is expected to launch alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max in the fall.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/13/apple-testing-flip-foldable-iphone/">Apple Now Testing Flip-Style Foldable iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-testing-flip-style-foldable-iphone.2477649/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
