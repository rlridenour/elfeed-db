<p>As if it were the manager of a candy store deciding which chewing gum to stock, the administration of Kennesaw State University (Georgia) is deciding which majors to offer solely by seeing how many kids already like them. <span id="more-53774"></span></p>
<p>(As familiar as this mindset has become to us all, its oddness is worth drawing attention to every once in a while.)</p>
<p>The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia have criteria for the identification of <a href="https://www.usg.edu/regents/assets/regents/documents/board_meetings/agenda_2015_08.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;low-producing&#8221; majors</a>: fewer than 10 graduates per year for a bachelor’s program. The Kennesaw administration identified those majors, and then, though (according to <a href="https://www.wabe.org/betrayal-kennesaw-state-students-faculty-push-back-on-university-decision-to-offload-philosophy-black-studies-majors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WABE</a>) not required by the Regents to do so, to &#8220;get the most of its &#8216;limited resources,'&#8221; decided to cut them (according to <a href="https://theatlantavoice.com/kennesaw-state-university-black-studies-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Atlanta Voice</em></a>).</p>
<p>The result is that students at Kennesaw will no longer be able to choose to major in <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu/radow/academics/history-philosophy/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philosophy</a>, <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu/degrees-programs/bachelor-degrees/black-studies.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Studies</a>, or <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu/degrees-programs/bachelor-degrees/technical-communication.php?major=Bachelor+of+Science+in+Technical+Communication+&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kennesaw.edu%2Fdegrees-programs%2Fbachelor-degrees%2Ftechnical-communication.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technical Communication</a>.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the Dean Catherine Kaukinen of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences has said that faculty and staff involved with these majors will keep their jobs, which of course raises the question of how much of the university&#8217;s &#8220;limited resources&#8221; are freed up by cutting the majors. Perhaps that will change after the two-year &#8220;teach out&#8221; period for existing majors in the affected programs to satisfy their requirements has elapsed.</p>

<p>WABE <a href="https://www.wabe.org/betrayal-kennesaw-state-students-faculty-push-back-on-university-decision-to-offload-philosophy-black-studies-majors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that the Philosophy Program seemed to be on the cusp of moving out of the &#8220;low-producing&#8221; category:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>According to faculty, there were 61 majors and 31 minors in the philosophy program at the beginning of April. The philosophy program has graduated six in FY 2024 and six in FY 2023, but [says it] will graduate 12 in FY 2025.</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, there are concerns that the university did not follow proper procedures in deactivating the majors. WABE reports:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The move by the university has drawn backlash from students and faculty members who say university administrators circumvented KSU’s own processes for deactivating a program.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The [College of Humanities and Social Sciences&#8217;] curriculum committee passed a resolution on April 14 stating that Kaukinen had verbally communicated the deactivation of the three programs to department heads without administrators having first gone through <a href="https://catalog.kennesaw.edu/content.php?catoid=81&amp;navoid=8568">the curriculum review process</a>, which requires approval from the department or school curriculum committee, department chairs and others.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>According to the 2025 <a href="https://www.kennesaw.edu/academic-affairs/curriculum-instruction-assessment/docs/curriculum-guide-2025.pdf">KSU curriculum guide</a>, the deactivation of any program falls under a list of changes that “must be approved” through this process.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Then, after Kaukinen’s April 24 email announcing the deactivation, the Faculty Senate passed a resolution on April 28 calling on the administration to comply with the curriculum review process.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Amy Donahue, an associate professor of philosophy, told WABE that philosophy degree output is expected to increase this year and next, and the administration’s decision to pursue deactivations without going through the review process was “unprecedented.”</em></p>
