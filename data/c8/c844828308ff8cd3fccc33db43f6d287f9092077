Apple is developing versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> with OLED displays, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/apple-plans-oled-for-ipad-mini-ipad-air-macbook-air-mini-water-resistance">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple already uses OLED displays in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, and has plans to expand the technology to additional devices in the coming months and years.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will get an OLED display as soon as 2026, and improved water resistance is also a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not plan to bring OLED technology to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; in 2026, and the model coming next spring will continue to use an LCD display. While the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will get OLED at a later date, it probably won't happen until at least 2027.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, Apple will sell the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; all with OLED displays, but there are no plans to add OLED to the low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; will be updated with an OLED display when it is next updated, perhaps as soon as 2026. After adding an OLED display to the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, Apple will bring OLED to the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. Apple has started early work on an OLED &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, but it isn't expected to see a launch until 2028 at the earliest.<br/>

The version of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; planned for spring 2026 will continue to feature an LCD display.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/apple-ipad-macbook-oled-displays/">Apple Expanding OLED Displays to iPad Mini, iPad Air, and MacBook Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expanding-oled-displays-to-ipad-mini-ipad-air-and-macbook-models.2470014/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
