Apple has long been working towards an iPhone with an all-screen design, and it might finally achieve the feat in a few more years from now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/All-Screen-iPhone-2027-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001660" /><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-06-22/will-apple-buy-an-ai-company-apple-takes-a-close-look-at-acquiring-perplexity-mc7m98q9"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple will shrink the size of the Dynamic Island on new iPhone models released next year. A year after that, he expects Apple to release a redesigned 20th-anniversary iPhone model.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/08/ios-26-liquid-glass-20th-anniversary-iphone/">previously said</a> that the 20th-anniversary iPhone will feature curved glass edges, extraordinarily slim bezels, and a truly edge-to-edge screen with no cutout. It would be the first iPhone model with a truly seamless, all-screen design.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma reported that next year's iPhone 18 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/">would feature under-screen Face ID</a>. He said that the devices would have only a small hole in the top-left corner of the screen, to accommodate the front camera. He also said that the devices would no longer have a pill-shaped cutout at the top of the screen, so we are unsure what to make of Gurman saying there will still be a smaller Dynamic Island next year.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it sounds like the first all-screen iPhone model with both under-screen Face ID and an under-screen front camera will be released in 2027.<br/>
<br/>
The transition to an all-screen design has been gradual. With the iPhone X in 2017, Apple moved from Touch ID and thick bezels to Face ID and a notch. With the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, Apple moved from a notch to the Dynamic Island.<br/>
