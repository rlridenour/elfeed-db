<p>Amazon is making a big change to how it handles serving ebooks to those who have bought them from the Kindle store<sup id="fnref-34106-comixology"><a href="https://sixcolors.com#fn-34106-comixology" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup>. Starting on Feb. 26, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb">it’s closing the “USB sideloading” hole</a> that allowed owners of older Kindle hardware to download a file in their web browser and transfer it to their Kindle via USB.</p>
<p>This feature was designed for users who had connectivity on their computer, but not on their Kindle. But it’s also been the easiest pathway to get ebook files out of Amazon’s copy protection scheme so that they can be converted to play back on other devices. As someone who <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/05/kobo-libra-h2o-liberated-from-amazon/">switched to Kobo</a> a few years ago, that’s important to me. I bought these books—if I want to read them on something that’s not controlled by Amazon, that’s my business.</p>
<p>While I remain optimistic about the ability of scrappy underdogs to circumvent the copy protection regimes of big tech companies, the fact is that Amazon’s newer file format has been incredibly difficult to crack—hence the value of the USB downloading hole that Amazon’s about to close.</p>
<p>I should be <em>absolutely clear here</em> that if all you do is use a Kindle or the Kindle app, nothing is changing and you’ll still be able to download your books on your devices or in your apps. All that’s happening is that Amazon is eliminating a way to easily download an ebook file directly, which is useful in converting those files to other formats.</p>
<p>If you have a substantial library of Kindle books and want to download them before Feb. 26, you’ll find that Amazon’s website makes it laborious to download them a book at a time. Fortunately, there’s a tool that will automatically download everything.</p>
<p>Most of the books you download from Amazon will come with an older form of copy protection. This is easily circumvented if you have the right software, as well as an older Kindle. (Which you should have, because Amazon should only allow you to download books for sideloading if you have such a device linked to your Amazon account!)</p>
<p>The process involves using <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com">Calibre</a>, a free open source ebook library utility <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/02/calibre-how-i-put-epub-books-on-my-kindle/">I’ve written about a lot</a>. You’ll also need to install <a href="https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools">the DeDRM tools package</a>, which is designed to remove copy protection from ebooks. When you configure DeDRM, you’ll need to enter in the serial number(s) of the hardware Kindles you own, so they can be used to decrypt the book information.</p>
<p>With this all set up, you should be able to drag files downloaded from Amazon into Calibre, and then export them to other devices or even to read on standalone apps. When my Kobo is connected to my Mac, I can select items in my Calibre library, right click, and choose “send to device.” The files are automatically converted to the Kobo ePub format and placed on my Kobo. It’s really well done.</p>

<p>So now, the bulk download part. I used the <a href="https://github.com/treetrum/amazon-kindle-bulk-downloader">Amazon Kindle eBook Bulk Downloader</a> by friend of the site <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treetrum/114035919310658979#.">Sam Davis</a>. You will need some Terminal know-how (or the help of a friend who has it). Following Sam’s instructions, I <a href="https://bun.sh/docs/installation">installed bun</a>, ran <code>bun install</code>, added my Amazon username and password to my environment variables via the <code>export</code> command, and then ran <code>bun run start —baseUrl "https://www.amazon.com"</code> since I’m in the United States.</p>
<p>At that point, Sam’s tool took off and downloaded 1,692 items! It took a while, but then I dragged the results into Calibre and now if I ever want to read a book I previously bought for my Kindle on a Kobo or anywhere else that doesn’t have a Kindle app, I can do so.</p>
<p>If you or a Terminal-confident friend want to make sure you’ve got access to your Kindle library on other platforms (such as Kobo), make some time before Feb. 26. And if you’ve already moved away from Kindle and didn’t realize you could still access your old books, maybe this post will give you the inspiration. Better hurry.</p>
