<p>After Arthur Conan Doyle&#8217;s death, his biographer Hesketh Pearson claimed to have discovered among his papers <a href="https://archive.org/details/conandoyle00pear_0/page/131/mode/2up?view=theater">the scenario of an uncompleted tale</a>.</p>
<p>A girl appeals to Sherlock Holmes for help &#8212; her uncle has been found shot in his bedroom, and her lover has been arrested as a suspect. The lover has recently had a quarrel with the old man; a revolver is found in his house that could have fired the fatal shot; and he owns a ladder whose feet match marks below the dead man&#8217;s window and which bears incriminating soil on its feet. The girl suspects another man who has been paying court to her.</p>
<p>Holmes and Watson go to the village, where they discover a pair of stilts in a disused well. When the accused man is found guilty of murder, Holmes is driven to a desperate stratagem: He dresses an actor as the murdered man, mounts him on the stilts, and has him approach the villain&#8217;s bedroom window, crying, &#8220;As you came for me, I have come for you!&#8221; Terrified, the man makes a full confession: He had planted the revolver and smeared the ladder&#8217;s feet with soil, hoping to win the girl and her money.</p>
<p>Pearson adds, apparently without intending the pun, &#8220;Presumably Doyle scrapped this because he felt on reflection that the episode of the stilts was rather tall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the story, Richard Lancelyn Green wrote, &#8220;there is no evidence to show that it is by [Doyle] and strong internal evidence to suggest that it&#8217;s not.&#8221; For what it&#8217;s worth, Robert A. Cutter <a href="https://archive.org/details/finaladventureso0000doyl_u8y7/page/118/mode/2up">completed the adventure in 1947</a>.</p>
