<p>Let&rsquo;s say I have this code (TypeScript) with long <strong>camelCased</strong> variable names.

<p>I&rsquo;m ok with <strong>camelCase</strong> variables especially if this is a convention for a language.
But at the same time I find it a bit difficult to read compared to <strong>underscore_case</strong> style.</p>
<p>Meet <code>M-x glasses-mode</code>.</p>
<p>A beautiful minor mode that is there, built-in, since Emacs 21.
Look what it does

<p>The mode doesn&rsquo;t change text in the buffer. It just makes it look like <strong>camelCase</strong> variable names became <strong>underscore_case</strong>.
It is possible to keep editing the buffer and variable names will adjust on the fly. You can use your <code>M-x rg</code> or <code>M-x grep</code> and they will search for the
text under cursor in <strong>camelCase</strong> because, again, text in the buffer isn&rsquo;t changed.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
