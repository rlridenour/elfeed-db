Apple today shared The Parent Presentation, which explains why a Mac is a useful tool in college. The customizable 81-slide presentation is available in PowerPoint, Keynote, and Google Slides formats. After <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/college-students/">downloading the template on this page</a>, you can fill in your name and some other key details, and make other edits to your liking.<br/>
<br/>
The presentation mostly contains tongue-in-cheek comments, but it also outlines a few real benefits of Macs, such as the MacBook Air's portability.<br/>
<br/>
In an accompanying YouTube video shared by Apple, comedian Martin Herlihy shows a group of high school students how to effectively use The Parent Presentation. The seven-minute video is split into chapters, in case you are too busy studying.<br/>

Apple's annual Back to School promotion <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/17/apple-back-to-school-2025-now-live/">began earlier this week</a>. It offers college students a free accessory, like AirPods, with the purchase of an eligible new Mac or iPad.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also offers students a 10% discount on select products.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/20/apple-shares-the-parent-presentation-for-mac/">Apple Shares PowerPoint Presentation That Can Help Convince Your Parents to Buy You a Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-powerpoint-presentation-that-can-help-convince-your-parents-to-buy-you-a-mac.2459365/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
