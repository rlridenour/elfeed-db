<p>Taegan Goddard, a few days ago at Political Wire:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sudden <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2025/09/17/abc-pulls-jimmy-kimmel/">suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s show</a> after threats
from FCC chair Brendan Carr was a jolt. It looked like the next
step in Donald Trump’s campaign to silence dissent.</p>

<p>But there’s another way to see it: an opportunity.</p>

<p>It’s been clear since the last election that conservatives
dominate the independent media space. Trump rode the reach of
right-wing podcasts to victory while Kamala Harris stuck to
traditional television.</p>

<p>But those old outlets are collapsing — and they’re never
coming back.</p>

<p>That means the stars of late-night TV — Kimmel, Colbert and
others — could thrive outside corporate networks. They can build
their own platforms, reach bigger audiences, and escape the grip
of billionaires and timid executives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Goddard didn’t say it in this piece, the subtext should be that building the alternative on Substack or social media is not the answer, either. The Internet is decentralized and built exactly to counter these forces our country is facing under Trump 2.0.</p>

<p>The big problem is YouTube. With YouTube, Google has a centralized chokehold on video. We need a way that’s as easy and scalable to host video content, independently, as it is for written content. I don’t know what the answer to that is, technically, but we ought to start working on it with urgency.</p>
