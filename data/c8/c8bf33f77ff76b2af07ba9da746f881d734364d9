<p>Cory Ondrejka joins in on the 40-year-old retro computing reminiscing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For being otherwise bright folks, it’s remarkable how completely
wrong they all are. The Atari was the best computer to have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This whole friendly debate reminds me of the oft-cited adage that the best camera is the one you have with you: The best computer in the 1980s was whichever one your parents bought you. I honestly don’t remember anyone I knew who had an Atari computer. Atari game consoles, sure — almost <em>everyone</em> I knew had a 2600, and we all coveted the 5200. <a href="https://appdot.net/@morrick/114866268850615377">But they sure were cool-looking</a>.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a><sup>*</sup> — who founded and named Commodore in 1953 as a typewriter company and was running the company when it launched the PET (1977), VIC-20 (1980), and Commodore 64 (1982) — left the company after a dispute with the board in 1984 (a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/19/business/apple-computer-entrepreneur-s-rise-and-fall.html">common</a> industry occurrence in those days, seemingly), founded a new company briefly named Tramel Technology (not “Tramiel”, for ease of spelling), which bought the then-failing consumer business of Atari from Warner Communications and took the Atari name for its own. In 1985 Tramiel <a href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/atari-st-40th-anniversary">launched the Atari ST line at CES</a>. To me the 16-bit Atari ST barely registers in my memory — I don’t think I ever encountered one anywhere, including in a store. When I think of Atari personal computers I think of the <a href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/atari-st-40th-anniversary">8-bit Atari 800</a> (pretty cool!) and 400 (horrible — perhaps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CnYI0E_6mk">the worst keyboard ever shipped</a>) from 1979.</p>

<p>(Anyway, neither of those aforecited adages are really true, though. Some cameras are much better than others. And the best computers back then were the Apple II’s.)</p>

<p><small>* Just me or was <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&amp;q=jack+tramiel&amp;ia=images&amp;iax=images">Tramiel a dead ringer</a> for character actor <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0432410/">Gordon Jump</a>, of <em>WKRP in Cincinnati</em> fame?</small></p>
