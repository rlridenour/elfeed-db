<p>In the latest development, President Trump has escalated pressure on Iran by ordering a major U.S. military build-up toward the Gulf while warning Tehran that “time is running out” to accept a new deal over its nuclear program. Iran’s leaders have rejected the threats and signaled readiness to respond if attacked, as multiple outlets describe rising fears that a misstep could widen into a regional conflict. Alongside the military messaging, diplomacy is still moving: Iran’s foreign minister is traveling to Turkey for talks aimed at averting U.S. action, and Ankara has presented itself as a mediator as pressure mounts on all sides to find an off-ramp. Russia has also publicly urged restraint and negotiations, warning against the use of force. The backdrop includes Iran’s nuclear dispute with the West and recent internal unrest, which several reports say has weakened the Islamic Republic while simultaneously raising the stakes for any further strikes or retaliation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wjWIHPizqYxEmikYA8S2I58IkBYvSrWznN0XcPnQLCDErjxFgXQJXNO0ZJli5nHw9rHUN_aaM_CPLR-8cIf3fqtsfYuaBhgQjUZ1vLhoJ6iyMWKP54iCOowu5_p76FCaVHvH6L9-6QpHY1aPyHA4l7lq1yrq6_zd-_eHSh4WL8ft3O8pwA' alt='The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Strait of Hormuz, November 2019.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Strike options: Sources cited by Dawn said options discussed inside the U.S. system range from targeted strikes on Iranian security commanders and institutions to broader attacks on ballistic missiles or nuclear enrichment facilities, with no final decision yet.</li><li>Turkey mediation: Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan proposed a video conference between President Trump and Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, an unusual idea given that the Guardian reports no formal direct U.S.-Iran talks for a decade.</li><li>EU pressure: Semafor reported the European Union is expected to add Iran’s Revolutionary Guard to its terrorism blacklist as part of a stepped-up diplomatic push.</li><li>Rubio posture: RT reported Secretary of State Marco Rubio told a Senate hearing the U.S. posture in the region could “respond” and potentially act “preemptively” to protect U.S. forces and facilities.</li><li>Arsenal focus: RT reported Rubio warned Iran has accumulated “thousands and thousands” of long-range ballistic missiles, a factor shaping U.S. and allied threat assessments.</li></ul><blockquote>Our brave Armed Forces are prepared — with their fingers on the trigger — to immediately and powerfully respond to ANY aggression against our beloved land, air, and sea,” - Abbas Araghchi</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. President Donald Trump: Trump says “time is running out” for Tehran to agree to a nuclear deal and highlights the dispatch of a “massive Armada,” framing the build-up as leverage to force agreement.
