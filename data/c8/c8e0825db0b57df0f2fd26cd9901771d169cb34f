<p>Allies of UK prime minister Keir Starmer launched an effort to fend off a reported leadership challenge after anonymous briefings suggested Health Secretary Wes Streeting could be a contender; Streeting strongly denied plotting to oust the prime minister and called the briefings &quot;self‑defeating&quot;. The speculation centres on the risk that Labour could face a challenge after Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s budget on Nov. 26 or following next year’s local elections, a timetable cited by several outlets. Senior figures inside and around Downing Street have traded accusations and denials in media briefings, and the uncertainty briefly moved UK government borrowing costs in early trading.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/sRktk3T-4RllXE8PZzopVuuKscWXxm1bFaKSU9opyMXQc5c9f6cOyOUXoqkP1O23Mgr47Oupgav7dIztqYBqKbIi6ZMdWrUaOhqmlWvlA9qlPufKK6Lu4WXKhyhAzIgrOylylxb4tPCYPUDMe5Z3sJksQd_sq3car5JEzsxMrBKAbJ_Zs_ZnZ1YjRcI1I591PDIlCjHt' alt='Keir Starmer (file photo)' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Frontbench tensions: Reports said about 50 members of the government frontbench were reportedly prepared to stand down if the chancellor’s Nov. 26 budget landed badly, a claim first flagged in press coverage and cited during the row</li><li>Downing Street reaction: Some senior figures described the anonymous briefings as either an organised effort to protect the prime minister or a &#x27;cock‑up&#x27; by aides, illustrating competing interpretations within No 10</li><li>Streeting’s stance: Wes Streeting rejected leadership talk on multiple broadcast interviews, saying the attacks were damaging to the government’s message and urging those briefing against colleagues to be held to account</li><li>Market signal: Traders reacted to the speculation: UK government borrowing costs rose as gilt prices slipped in early trading amid the leadership rumours</li></ul><blockquote>It&#x27;s totally self-defeating briefing, not least because it&#x27;s not true, and I don&#x27;t understand how anyone thinks it&#x27;s helpful to the prime minister. - Wes Streeting</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Keir Starmer allies: Allies say they are working to head off what they call a reckless attempt to unseat the prime minister and warn a challenge would unsettle markets and international partners.
