I&rsquo;m writing this on September 1 so there&rsquo;s a new theme for the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Carnival">Emacs Carnival</a>. Nonetheless, <a href="https://sdf.org/~pkal/blog/emacs/pitch.html">one final Elevator Pitch</a> showed up in my feed and it seemed worthy of a few words. The post is from Philip Kaluđerčić and seems to me to be a particularly well thought out explanation of why one might want to adopt the Emacs way of life.

<p>
The term &ldquo;Emacs way of life&rdquo; may seem a bit overwrought but I think it captures the way many Emacs users feel about their editor. For a lot of us, Emacs informs the way we think about and approach our computing.

<p>
Kaluđerčić starts his post with a short list of things that are great about Emacs and the reasons you might want to embrace it. The list is short but heavily footnoted. The meat of his arguments are in the footnotes, which are much longer than the text they reference. Take a look at them and see what you think.

<a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13228">As I&rsquo;ve said before</a>, I&rsquo;m been a bit obsessed with the Elevator Pitch meme and I&rsquo;m sorry to see it end. I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed seeing others explain why they love using Emacs. On the other hand, I&rsquo;m sure the majority of Irreal readers will be happy to see me move onto something else.</p>
