<p id="p1">Almost a year ago, Federico linked to <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/ipod-fans-are-trying-to-preserve-lost-click-wheel-games/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a story on Ars Technica by Kyle Orland</a> about efforts to preserve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_game" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPod games</a>; now, the process has been completed. Yes, iPod games, not iPad. For a brief period of time in the late 2000s, Apple offered a selection of 54 iPod games for sale through the iTunes Store. The collection included titles from notable developers like Square Enix (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Defenders" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crystal Defenders</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_Summoner:_The_Unsung_Heroes" rel="noopener noreferrer">Song Summoner</a>), Sega (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(1991_video_game)" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>), and Namco (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pac-Man</a>). Those games are long since gone, having been <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-removes-ipod-click-wheel-games-from-itunes-store/" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed from the iTunes store in 2011</a>, and are just one of many examples of a part of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/app-preservation-saving-the-app-stores-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer">videogame history becoming inaccessible</a> to fans and researchers due to neglect.</p>
<p id="p2">However, thanks to the efforts of the Clickwheel Games Preservation Project led by GitHub user Olsro, every iPod game has been preserved. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/all-54-lost-clickwheel-ipod-games-have-now-been-preserved-for-posterity/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As Orland explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  [Olsro] lucked into contact with three people who had large iPod game libraries in the first month or so after the project&rsquo;s launch last October.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p4">After that, though, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/all-54-lost-clickwheel-ipod-games-have-now-been-preserved-for-posterity/" rel="noopener noreferrer">things got tough</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote5"><p>
  Getting working access to the final unpreserved game,&nbsp;<em>Real Soccer 2009</em>, was &ldquo;especially cursed,&rdquo; Olsro tells Ars. &ldquo;Multiple [people] came to me during this summer and all attempts failed until a new one from yesterday,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I even had a situation when someone had an iPod Nano 5G with a playable copy of&nbsp;<em>Real Soccer</em>, but the drive was appearing empty in the Windows Explorer. He tried recovery tools &amp; the iPod NAND just corrupted itself, asking for recovery&hellip;&rdquo;
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p6">Not only has the project preserved the entire library of games, but now, they&rsquo;re available to anyone who still has a working iPod that supports them. Sonic on iPod will never be considered the definitive version of Sega&rsquo;s classic, but if you ask me, it&rsquo;s still worth preserving the memories of people like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1fydso6/comment/lv0jztb/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user Mahboishk</a> for whom, &ldquo;The iPod version of&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>&nbsp;was my introduction to the franchise as a kid, and it got me into speedrunning.&rdquo; That 2000s version of Sonic is an important link in the story that has helped Sonic endure as a franchise from its &rsquo;90s origins to today. Now you too can try your hand at navigating the Green Hill Zone with a click wheel.</p>
