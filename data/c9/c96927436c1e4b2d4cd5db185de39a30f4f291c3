</ul><h1>Stay Cool</h1><p><strong>2 Reasons Why You Shouldn’t Buy These Pot Holders &amp; 2 Reasons Why You Should</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><em>Reason #1 Why You Shouldn’t: Limits Potential To Make An Indelible Pop Culture Reference</em></p>
<p>Because these pot holders protect your hands against heat better than an old-fashioned cloth pot holder, you’re less likely to drop a hot pot or pan upon removing it from the oven. And, sure, this means the meal will be preserved, and dinner will be complete. It also means, however, that you will not have the perfect opportunity to reference the seminal Neptunes-produced 2004 hit by Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. (stage name: Snoop Dogg), “Drop It Like It’s Hot.”</p>
<p><em>Reason #2 Why You Shouldn’t: An Intimate Knowledge Of How Hot The Food Is</em></p>
<p>Yes, traditional pot holders allow more heat through. Yes, this increases your chance of burning yourself and/or dropping the piping hot tray as you transfer it from the oven to whatever surface it’ll rest on. But consider this: the pain inflicted upon your palms very well might warn against further (and significantly more frustrating) pain that could be inflicted upon your tongue and the roof of your mouth. Because, if your body is communicating to you that “this tray is super friggin’ hot!” there’s less of a chance that you will take a forkful of the food upon it and pop it straight into your mouth. Whereas, with these pot holders, the heat will register as little more than warmth, making the temptation to eat immediately all the stronger.</p>

<p><em>Reason #1 Why You Should: Keeping Your Dreams of Hand-Modeling Alive</em></p>
<p>If you were going to become a hand model, it probably would’ve happened by now, right? WRONG! You never know when the right talent scout is going to lay eyes on your beautiful digits in a Starbucks and change your life forever. So, why not avoid a bunch of gnarly scars by wearing some good, heat-resistant pot holders while cooking?</p>
<p><em>Reason #2 Why You Should: They Are Way Way Better Than Normal Pot Holders In Terms Of Heat Resistance</em></p>
<p>Feels like we should stress this a little harder. If you’ve never used a high-quality set of pot holders like this, you don’t know what you’re missing. They are undeniably better than your basic cloth ones and will limit potential burns (the above-mentioned mouth burns notwithstanding).</p>
<hr />
<p>In conclusion: they are very good pot holders. Buy them if you need some good pot holders.</p>
