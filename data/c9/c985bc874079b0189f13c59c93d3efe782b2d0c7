<p>President Donald Trump warned that the United States would stop supporting Iraq if Iraqi lawmakers reinstall Nouri al-Maliki as prime minister, after al-Maliki was nominated by the largest Shia bloc in parliament. Trump argued that Iraq suffered “poverty and total chaos” during al-Maliki’s previous time in office and said Iraq would have “zero” chance of success without US help. The warning highlights Iraq’s delicate effort to balance relationships with both the United States and Iran, as al-Maliki is described in the coverage as having ties to Iran. Even so, the episode underscores how much international attention remains focused on Iraq’s next government—and how decisions in Baghdad can quickly ripple through wider regional diplomacy.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ZOkcA6dYDIUI5nWsigoynRarzJsJJTrVdUnKvy-jMPX3_cDCGvAZjkLVyP3E6zzzuKC3Qrf1kU1bqnn9YSsmBgardhcuDRMS7-zerGJjruy_Mgl1k2v1m4o0OqnkzbqCV4CYWZku92uRlHkYkBJdFCHSH6AQP9AnrILecB5u1yqA9J67jJRwOz7LafJI5BAz1fEhN6SyD4PWrBtUR9aEXGEMIQmKwY3884b5LaBRo_-y-E5zCdR8YmJ7i3OUe-o' alt='A photo accompanying coverage of President Trump’s warning to Iraq over its prime minister choice.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>How selection works: Iraq’s Coordination Framework—described as a coalition of Shiite parties with close ties to Iran—acts as a kingmaker for the premiership and reportedly could not choose between candidates, leaving them to decide.</li><li>Political reshuffle: Outgoing prime minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani suspended his bid for a second term earlier this month after his bloc won the largest share of seats in November’s election but fell short of a governing majority.</li><li>Leverage mentioned: One potential US pressure point cited is restricting Iraq’s access to oil revenues held at the New York Federal Reserve.</li><li>Maliki legacy: Deutsche Welle notes al-Maliki is often seen as responsible for sectarian tensions and military mismanagement that helped create conditions for the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq.</li></ul><blockquote>I&#x27;m hearing that the Great Country of Iraq might make a very bad choice by reinstalling Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He says the US will stop helping Iraq if it reinstalls al-Maliki, arguing Iraq would have little chance of success without American support.
