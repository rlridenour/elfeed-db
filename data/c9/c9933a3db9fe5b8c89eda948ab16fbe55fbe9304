Apple is being sued by developers unhappy with the company's "willful violation" of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-anti-steering-injunction-violation/">anti-steering injunction</a> the court ordered as part of its legal battle with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>. A company called Pure Sweat Basketball has teamed up with law firm Hagens Berman to file a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250505305754/en/Hagens-Berman-Apple-Hit-with-Class-Action-Lawsuit-for-App-Store-Injunction-Violation-by-Same-Law-Firm-That-Secured-%24100M-iOS-Developer-Win">class-action lawsuit</a> against Apple in an attempt to win some money for developers.<br/>

The lawsuit focuses on the recent Apple vs. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; decision where Apple was found to be in contempt of court. Back in 2021, Apple was ordered to relax its anti-steering rules that prevent developers from directing customers to purchase options outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Because of appeals, Apple didn't have to comply until January 17, 2024, but when it did, Apple did so in a way that the court said was anticompetitive.<br/>
<br/>
Apple forced developers to pay between 12 and 27 percent in commission when customers made a purchase through an app using an external payment link, which was an issue because developers also had to pay payment processors. Apple also had strict rules allowing only a single link and it used scare screens to try to prevent customers from making purchases outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last week was forced to change its U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; policies to support external payment links in apps with no restrictions, a decision that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-appeals-app-store-payment-rule-changes/">Apple is appealing</a>, but the class action lawsuit argues that developers should be compensated for the trouble. It claims that Apple's moves to circumvent the injunction cost developers "billions of dollars" in revenue.<br/>
<br/>
Due to Apple's anti-steering implementation, only 34 developers of 136,000 took advantage of the external payment link option before the terms were changed last week, and the lawsuit is seeking restitution <a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/apple-app-store-injunction-violation#block-form-block">for all U.S. developers</a> who offered in-app purchases for non-zero prices between January 17, 2024 and when Apple fully complied with the original injunction.<br/>
<br/>
Apple should be forced to disgorge all of its "ill-gotten gains," according to the lawsuit. The law firm that's handling the case, Hagens Berman, previously secured <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/app-store-changes-developer-lawsuit-settlement/">a &#36;100 million settlement</a> for developers over Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fees.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-developer-lawsuit-link-fee/">Apple Faces Developer Lawsuit After Defying App Store Injunction</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-faces-developer-lawsuit-after-defying-app-store-injunction.2456560/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
