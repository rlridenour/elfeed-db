The program will provide &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; owners with manuals, genuine Apple parts, Apple Diagnostics troubleshooting sessions, tools, and rental toolkits to conduct their own repairs. It will now support the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and later), <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> (M4), <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> (A17 Pro), and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; (A16) starting tomorrow for display, battery, camera, and charging port repairs. <br/>

Apple launched the &zwnj;Self Service Repair&zwnj; program in 2022 to support individuals who are comfortable with undertaking their own device repairs, with the same resources used by Apple. &zwnj;Self Service Repair&zwnj; now supports 65 Apple devices, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>. The program is set to expand to Canada this summer, becoming the 34th country to offer it.<br/>
