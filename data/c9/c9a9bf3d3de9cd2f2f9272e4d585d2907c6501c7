         <p>In this ~21-minute video I demonstrate the new optional extension for
Denote that I am developing. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence.el</code> is part of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> package. Its purpose is to streamline the creation of
“sequence notes”, i.e. files that have an inherent relationship
between them. The sequence is represented as a number.</p>

<p>Note that the code is in-development and will be released as part of
Denote version 3.2.0. I still plan to make some refinements, though
the core functionality is already done.</p>

<h2>About Denote</h2>

<p>Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea
that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming
scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is
about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically
streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to
link between them.</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>
