<p>Leaders from government, business and civil society are gathering in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, which draws roughly 3,000 participants and large numbers of activists and media alongside official delegates. This year’s agenda is being shaped heavily by President Donald Trump’s expected appearance and outreach to CEOs, as well as heightened transatlantic tensions after his Greenland-related tariff threats became a central topic around the summit. Organizers and attendees are still holding sessions on global economic issues, but multiple outlets describe a noticeable shift toward navigating geopolitical friction and uncertainty around trade and alliances.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ktCc8kI8rp-3hElJtswZYhTXxLUeL0ldkEGY_Mkwz_-fDkiiTI-iOa1BZ8ODElUvgilcIEQwsPp9eAbVLw3XTMSKtf-W_q5hYPyUVgKYo3LRBViaxRZWu3SfqFyM4raILfCXGhhTLXF472f4Hp9w0Hb-cDvKdLN5LGB3jH1FweRS086EBLi_GCvI2ITAGAukTv1AmkhiTEkvj_H_alabHe4' alt='Attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last year.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>CEO turnout: Around 850 chief executives and more than 100 corporate board chairs are expected in Davos this week, underscoring how much the forum functions as a top-level corporate convening point.</li><li>US–China courting: Both Washington and Beijing are using Davos to engage global executives, with President Trump planning a CEO meeting and China’s economic official He Lifeng also reportedly convening business leaders.</li><li>Workforce behind scenes: POLITICO describes the large logistical footprint in Davos, including support workers such as cleaners, coat checkers and attendants keeping the congress center and sponsor spaces running smoothly during the surge of visitors.</li><li>Activists present: Beyond official delegates, Davos also attracts activists, journalists and observers who converge on the town during the annual meeting.</li><li>Europe’s focus: European leaders are addressing the forum ahead of President Trump’s visit, with DW reporting Greenland-linked tariff threats hanging over discussions.</li></ul><blockquote>Being in the room enables me to get that feedback, - Tim Walsh</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US administration (President Trump): President Trump is using Davos to speak at the forum and convene corporate leaders, signaling an emphasis on direct engagement with global CEOs alongside a US delegation promoting an American agenda.
