AirPods have always worked with Android phones, but with limited functionality and a less seamless listening experience. A new app called <a href="https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods/releases/download/nightly-f547cc1/LibrePods-f547cc1.apk">LibrePods</a> is changing that.<br/>

The free app unlocks features on Android that are typically reserved for Apple devices, including ear detection that pauses music when you remove an earbud, Head Gestures for answering calls, and Conversational Awareness that lowers volume while you're talking. It also enables switching between noise control modes, checking accurate battery levels, and customizing accessibility settings.<br/>
<br/>
To make it all work, developer Kavish Devar reverse-engineered Apple's proprietary protocols to make AirPods identify a connected Android device as an iPhone or iPad, which tricks them into sharing device status information normally locked to Apple's ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
There are some caveats, though. LibrePods currently requires a rooted Android phone with the Xposed framework installed, thanks to what Devar calls "a bug in the Android Bluetooth stack." OnePlus and Oppo devices running ColorOS or OxygenOS 16 can use the app without rooting, however some features like Transparency mode customization still need root access.<br/>
<br/>
The app supports all AirPods models, including AirPods Max, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods Pro 3 (excluding heart rate monitoring), though not all features are unlocked on earlier AirPods. Interested Android owners can view more details about the project on its <a href="https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods">GitHub page</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods/releases/download/nightly-f547cc1/LibrePods-f547cc1.apk">directly download the APK file</a>.<br/>
