<p>Panama’s Supreme Court has ruled unconstitutional the concessions held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to operate two ports at either end of the Panama Canal, voiding the contracts and setting up a re-tendering process for the terminals. Panama’s government said canal-related operations would continue normally despite the legal changeover. The decision lands amid intensifying US-China competition over influence in Latin America, as Washington has signaled a renewed push under President Trump, who has publicly argued the US should “take back control” of the canal and limit Beijing’s influence. Beijing and the Hong Kong government criticized the ruling and said they would take steps to safeguard the interests of Chinese enterprises. For global shipping, the immediate message from Panama is reassurance: the waterway and port services will keep running while authorities work out the next operating arrangement, even as the decision creates uncertainty for CK Hutchison and any related transactions tied to its ports business.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/3Nv0I1TrsONROawL0jdwdVFrE_8kWRVVNEGhfX8s3_QPkaGP28uX4kK49qk6MTnDxW8ULxlRuZFu0cT3F0XGUOhfSB9eiRkuiW9-ztBHc9WkQhjbjM-XkPYyGCLUv1k_cvULE7cFX5FLVkblz7yl0joMb1_iGdgqN_6XDaJDEA' alt='A container port at the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Contract horizon: The court decision cancels CK Hutchison’s 25-year port contract and sends the concessions back to competitive bidding.</li><li>Deal uncertainty: The ruling adds uncertainty to CK Hutchison’s planned $23 billion global ports sale, which Firstpost reported could be put at risk.</li><li>Beijing response: China’s government warned it would take “necessary measures” or “necessary action” to protect the lawful rights of Chinese companies affected.</li><li>Hong Kong stance: Hong Kong’s government criticized the decision and warned it could hurt the interests of the Li Ka-shing-controlled conglomerate.</li><li>Regional context: Semafor noted China remains Latin America’s biggest trading partner even as the Trump administration increases focus on the region.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Panama’s government: Officials said the ports and canal operations would continue as normal while the country implements the court’s decision.
