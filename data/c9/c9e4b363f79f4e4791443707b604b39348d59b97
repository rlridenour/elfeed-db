<p>When I switched from Emacs 28.x to Emacs 29.x a few months ago I thought I would give Eglot a try instead LSP mode which I had been using for the past several years.  So far Eglot has just worked and simplified things for me. For Python I use Pyright for LSP. I should switch that over to <a href="https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server">Python language server</a> because it&#39;s said to be more performant due to the fact that it&#39;s written in Python where Pyright is Typescript but so far I haven&#39;t run into any issues.  </p>
<p>I don&#39;t care for web mode so I have just worked on html and css without any accompanying modes.  Today, I decided to look and see if there was a language server project for HTML and/or CSS and found the <a href="https://github.com/hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted">Vscode Langservers Extracted project</a> on GitHub.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Install via npm so that it&#39;s available on the Path.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">npm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted
</code></pre>
<p>Individual language servers can be installed from this project but I chose to just install all with them (extracted).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>vscode-html-language-server</code></li>
<li><code>vscode-css-language-server</code></li>
<li><code>vscode-json-language-server</code></li>
<li><code>vscode-eslint-language-server</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Starting Eglot (<code>M-x eglot</code>) for HTML and/or CSS buffer modes gives me pretty good syntax highlighting and completion as well as documentation.  A bonus that I have noticed is it also shows me RGB and hexadecimal colors in the buffer.  I have been using rainbow mode for hexadecimal but I think with Eglot and this new LSP addition I can remove that from my config since that&#39;s all I was using it for.</p>
<h2>Tailwind</h2>
<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense">project by Tailwind Labs</a> which I will work in next.  As of the date of this post there does not seem to be a way to have Eglot run multiple langservers for a given major mode.</p>
