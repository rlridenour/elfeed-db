Will there be another Apple event this October? We discuss the possibility below.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple in October</h2><br/>
Apple's most recent October events were in 2021 and 2023.<br/>
<br/>
In 2022 and 2024, Apple did not host an October event. Instead, it announced new products with press releases and a series of shorter product videos.<br/>

It is not yet known if Apple plans to host an October event this year, but it seems likely.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said iPad Pro models with Apple's M5 chip would be released this year. If that timeframe remains accurate, the likelihood of an October event this year is high, as the standard M1 through M4 chips were all unveiled during events.<br/>

Apple is also expected to update the Vision Pro with the M5 chip this year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's next MacBook Pro models with M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max chips will reportedly enter mass production soon, but they <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/">might not be announced until early 2026</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman expects Apple to update these products between late 2025 and early 2026, and most of them would be fitting for an October event:<ul><li><strong>Apple TV:</strong> A faster <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/">A17 Pro chip</a> that will support next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/tim-cook-shares-personalized-siri-update/">revamped version of Siri</a> powered by Apple Intelligence, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">likely</a> Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-n1-chip/">N1 chip with Wi-Fi 7 support</a>. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">built-in FaceTime camera</a> has been rumored for a future Apple TV, but it is unclear if that will arrive with the next model specifically.</li><br/>
<li><strong>HomePod mini:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/homepod-mini-new-chip/">S9 chip or newer</a> with support for next year's revamped version of Siri powered by Apple Intelligence, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">likely</a> Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-n1-chip/">N1 chip with Wi-Fi 7 support</a>, improved sound quality, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip for proximity features, and potentially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/05/new-homepod-mini-vision-pro-colors-rumored/">new color options like Red</a>.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>AirTag:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/airtag-2-longer-range-rumor/">Up to 3× longer item tracking range</a> vs. current AirTag, a more tamper-proof speaker, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/25/airtag-2-september-or-later-rumor/">"very low" battery life alerts</a>.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPad Pro:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">M5 chip</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">two front cameras</a>, allowing for photos and video calls in both portrait and landscape orientations.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Vision Pro:</strong> A faster <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/apple-vision-pro-2025-features/">M4 chip</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-code-confirms-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">M5 chip</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/apple-vision-pro-2025-features/">a new head strap</a> that improves comfort, and potentially a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/05/new-homepod-mini-vision-pro-colors-rumored/">Space Black color option</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>MacBook Pro:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/macbook-pro-with-m5-chips-2026-rumor/">Multiple</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/">sources</a> have indicated that MacBook Pro models with the M5 series of chips might not launch until early 2026, and it is unclear if any other Macs with M5 chips like an iMac or Mac mini would debut this year as a result. Perhaps we will see another MacBook Pro announcement <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-announces-m2-pro-macbook-pro/">in January</a>. In any case, it may be wise to skip the next MacBook Pro models, as bigger upgrades like an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/28/next-macbook-pro-nears-mass-production-report/">OLED touch screen and a thinner design</a> are expected for the subsequent models.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Studio Display:</strong> A new version of the Studio Display with mini-LED backlighting is expected to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/studio-display-2-rumor-recap/">in late 2025 or early 2026</a>. If no new Macs launch this year, then early 2026 is the more likely timeframe.</li></ul>Gurman's list did not mention the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/18/lower-cost-macbook-a18-pro-or-a19-pro/">rumored lower-priced MacBook with an A18 Pro or A19 Pro chip</a>, which is also expected to launch in late 2025 or early 2026.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/29/apple-event-october-2025-rumors/">Apple Event in October?
