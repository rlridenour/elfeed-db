Apple Al Jimi Mall in the city of Al Ain will open on Thursday, September 25, according to a new listing for the store in the Apple Store app. The store's page has yet to go live on Apple's website, though, so this date is not guaranteed yet.<br/>

Apple last year <a href="https://www.apple.com/ae/newsroom/2024/12/apple-accelerates-investment-in-united-arab-emirates-with-new-apple-store/">announced</a> that it would be opening a new store in Al Ain at some point in 2025, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/new-apple-stores-in-india-and-uae-this-year/">reiterated that timeframe</a> a few months ago. The company has <a href="https://www.apple.com/ae/retail/storelist/">four other stores</a> in the country — two in Dubai and two in Abu Dhabi.<br/>

Apple has been expanding its retail presence in the Middle East over the past few years. In July, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/08/apple-store-coming-to-saudi-arabia/">Apple's online store began operating in Saudi Arabia</a>, and the company said it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/08/apple-store-coming-to-saudi-arabia/">planned to open several stores</a> in that country starting in 2026. Apple said one of the stores would be in Diriyah, a UNESCO World Heritage site located on the outskirts of Riyadh.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/new-apple-store-opening-soon-in-uae/">New Apple Store Opening Soon in United Arab Emirates</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-store-opening-soon-in-united-arab-emirates.2467059/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
