I&rsquo;ve having a problem with Disqus that prevents me from replying to comments on Irreal (or probably from commenting at all with Disqus). Disqus seems aware of the problem so I expect they&rsquo;ll release a fix shortly.

In the mean time, be assured that I&rsquo;m not ignoring you, I just can&rsquo;t get Disqus to accept my comments.</p>
