<p>U.S. and Chinese officials reached an outline framework for a trade agreement on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, which would pause planned steeper U.S. tariffs and delay Chinese rare earth export controls for leaders to consider . Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the framework removed the threat of 100% U.S. tariffs scheduled for November 1 and expects China to resume substantial U.S. soybean purchases, while Chinese officials publicly remained circumspect about details . The two presidents, President Trump and President Xi Jinping, are due to review and possibly sign off on the terms when they meet on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Gyeongju later this week .
