<em>Severance</em> revolves around the mysterious company Lumon Industries. The company's employees cannot recall any memories about their personal lives while they are at work, and they cannot remember anything about the workplace when they leave the office. The series has an ensemble cast that has included Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Zach Cherry, John Turturro, Tramell Tillman, Patricia Arquette, Christopher Walken, and others.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Studio</em> is a satirical series about Hollywood's film industry. Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, the newly-appointed head of the embattled Continental Studios, with other cast members including Catherine O'Hara, Kathryn Hahn, Ike Barinholtz, and Chase Sui Wonders. Guest stars include Bryan Cranston, Zoë Kravitz, Ron Howard, Olivia Wilde, Dave Franco, Martin Scorsese, Anthony Mackie, Steve Buscemi, and many others.<br/>
