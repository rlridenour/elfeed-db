<p>This post is more of a note to myself, something I can store in my single emacs blog org file, so if I forget again, I can quickly search.</p>
<p>I keep forgetting the keybinding to shrink and expand an org table.</p>
<p>I often define tables to have a narrower width than content using the &lt;num&gt; concept in the top line of the table, but when I want to expand, I just can&rsquo;t remember the keybinding.</p>
<p>A search in <code>*help*</code> for <code>org-table-shrink</code> and <code>org-table-expand</code> reveals nothing!</p>

<p>Anyway, here is a note to myself:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">C-c TAB (translated from C-c &lt;tab&gt;) runs the command org-ctrl-c-tab
(found in org-mode-map), which is an interactive native-compiled
Lisp function in ‘org.el’.

It is bound to C-c TAB.

(org-ctrl-c-tab &amp;optional ARG)

Toggle columns width in a table, or show children.  Call
‘org-table-toggle-column-width’ if point is in a table.  Otherwise
provide a compact view of the children.  ARG is the level to hide.
</code></pre><p>For clarity, within an Org table, pressing <code>C-c &lt;TAB&gt;</code> will toggle shrink/expand the state of the column that the point is currently in.</p>
<p><code>C-u C-c &lt;TAB&gt;</code> will shrink all columns AND</p>
<p><code>C-u C-u C-c &lt;TAB&gt;</code> will expand all columns</p>
<p>Right, that is a note, just for me 😀</p>
