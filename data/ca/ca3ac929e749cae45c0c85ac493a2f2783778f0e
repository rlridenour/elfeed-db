<p>Elon Musk’s rocket and satellite company SpaceX has acquired his artificial intelligence start‑up xAI in what multiple outlets describe as the largest corporate merger ever by implied value, creating a combined private enterprise worth about $1.25 trillion. The transaction reportedly values SpaceX at roughly $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion, with xAI investors receiving SpaceX shares or cash and the merged company’s stock expected to be priced at about $526–527 per share in private markets. Musk says the deal is designed to tightly integrate AI development with rockets, satellite internet and data‑center infrastructure, including ambitious plans to build space‑based computing facilities to meet growing power needs for AI systems. Analysts note that by folding xAI into SpaceX, Musk is both betting on the long‑term importance of AI and seeking to give his AI venture access to the capital and infrastructure needed to compete with larger rivals such as OpenAI, Google, Meta and Anthropic.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ttzr6u1DUSvUed92dwMK9dfdkbpmdttylrBEFOqK4eztz856OSnGtaSHbU6ZPjt4UYBsh2l7CIdT9T7eAasffdvTwMs6G3K05a6jgMno0dAH' alt='Elon Musk attends the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, DC, November 19, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Record M&amp;A scale: The merger surpasses Vodafone’s 2000 takeover of Mannesmann, which had held the record for the world’s largest merger at about $203 billion, making the SpaceX–xAI tie‑up the biggest deal ever by implied value.</li><li>Investor swap terms: Holders of xAI shares are set to receive approximately 0.1433 shares of SpaceX for each xAI share, while some executives can instead choose cash at a per‑share SpaceX price of $75.46, according to people cited by Dawn.</li><li>IPO expectations: Sources cited by Reuters and RT say SpaceX is preparing for an initial public offering that could value the merged company at more than $1.5 trillion once it lists later this year.</li><li>Orbital data centers: SpaceX has filed plans to deploy around one million satellites for so‑called “orbital data centers,” a concept Musk has pitched as a way to provide computing power for AI directly from space.</li><li>Competitive pressures: Commentators note that Musk’s consolidation move reflects the steep costs of AI development, with xAI facing similar financial pressures as other start‑ups trying to match deep‑pocketed cloud and chip providers, a challenge illustrated by Oracle borrowing $25 billion to supply compute to OpenAI.</li></ul><blockquote>This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI’s mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars! - Elon Musk</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Elon Musk and SpaceX: Musk argues that integrating xAI into SpaceX will allow the group to build space‑based data centers and a unified platform that combines launch vehicles, satellite communications and AI computing to address what he calls insurmountable electricity constraints for purely land‑based AI infrastructure.
