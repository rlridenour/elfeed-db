<p>Just a quick one.</p>
<p>Often it seems I need a copy of a list of files / directories in plain text without any gubbins such as a path, permissions, date and all those shenanigans, basically <code>basenaming</code>; for example:</p>
<figure class="emacs-img"><img src="https://emacs.dyerdwelling.family/ox-hugo/20230115202613-emacs--Dired-Copy-Just-Directory-List-To-Kill-Ring.jpg">
</figure>

<p>So how can I achieve this in emacs? I would really prefer to use <code>dired</code> somehow rather than <code>shell / ls</code> (which was my first thought)</p>
<p>Below is my typical dired listing:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">drwxr-xr-x  4 4.0K Jan 15 19:35 Backup
drwxr-xr-x  3 4.0K Jan 14 19:33 Camera
drwxr-xr-x 22 4.0K Jan 15 19:01 content
-rw-r--r--  1   65 Dec 31 16:34 .directory
</code></pre><p>Rectangle marking first came to mind but the paste seems to have a weird format and strangely inserts the text.</p>
<p>So I came up with the following process:</p>
<p>In <code>dired</code>, select <strong>&rsquo;(&rsquo;</strong> <code>dired-hide-details-mode</code> which toggles off all the details and gives:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">Backup
Camera
content
.directory
</code></pre><p>This looks very promising and surely a simple <strong>M-w</strong> (kill-ring-save) will work?.  It doesn&rsquo;t work. It still copies the full details :(</p>
<p>However if org-copy-visible is used it does the same as in org mode in that it only copies the visible parts of the region.  I had no idea that functions from one mode can be used in another!</p>
