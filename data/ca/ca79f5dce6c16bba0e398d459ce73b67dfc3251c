<p>Norway’s Crown Princess Mette-Marit has issued a renewed apology after newly released US Justice Department files drew fresh attention to her past contacts with Jeffrey Epstein, the late US financier and convicted sex offender. In a statement released by the royal palace, she said she regretted the relationship and apologised to those who felt disappointed. The documents include extensive email correspondence that continued after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for child sex crimes, raising questions in Norway about judgment, accountability, and—more broadly—how public institutions handle proximity to powerful people later exposed as abusive. While the revelations have disappointed many Norwegians, reporting also points to continued, broad support for the monarchy—suggesting a desire for transparency and lessons learned alongside a preference for stability.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uCQdva9R8ABKHcqreC_qikqkq4IzN5GsC7wCoMpYJveS1E_OeO44QCr1Lj0PVHWkLwC1lTXp6EDWVtugLymO-hNJM0lFy1yRT1GsVXLJNjR9gpru2vYcFPy6EgbG1KI5Gto8u_eQrlcurg0Q3_A' alt='Norway’s Crown Princess Mette-Marit in an AP photo distributed with coverage of her apology.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Nature of the relationship: The newly released files portray what some outlets describe as a surprisingly close friendship between Mette-Marit and Epstein.</li><li>Earlier apology: Mette-Marit previously apologised for staying in contact with Epstein, saying she showed poor judgment.</li><li>Possible inquiries: Norwegian authorities were reported to be moving toward examining the new revelations about links to Epstein.</li><li>Wider reverberations: Deutsche Welle reports that the Epstein disclosures are also adding political pressure beyond Norway, touching prominent politicians in other European countries.</li><li>Royal headwinds: The episode comes as the royal family faces other strains, including reporting that Mette-Marit’s son faces trial for rape and assault, as Deutsche Welle reported.</li></ul><blockquote>I also apologise for the situation that I have put the royal family in, especially the King and Queen, - Crown Princess Mette-Marit</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Crown Princess Mette-Marit: She apologised to Norwegians and said she was sorry she did not understand “what kind of person” Epstein was, while repeating her regret over past contact with him.
