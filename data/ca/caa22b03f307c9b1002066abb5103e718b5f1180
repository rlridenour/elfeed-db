<p>&#8220;Start cheating. Because when everyone does, <span class="bg-blue-300 font-bold text-black px-1.5 mx-0.5 rounded-sm select-none">no one is</span>.&#8221;<span id="more-53571"></span></p>

<p>That&#8217;s the one-line summary of the &#8220;manifesto&#8221; for <a href="https://cluely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cluely</a>, an AI app. It&#8217;s an &#8220;undetectable assistant that sees your screen and hears your audio&#8221; and &#8220;feeds you answers in real time&#8221; that you can then copy and utter, say, during meetings (or dates, as the creepy video in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/roy-lee-goat_i-got-kicked-out-of-columbia-for-building-activity-7319827343730974720-f4ew/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this LinkedIn post</a> suggests). It&#8217;s for computers now, but no doubt it or something like it will be available at some point for phones, smart glasses, and smart contact lenses, and perhaps, ultimately, our brains.</p>
<p>No longer will you need to think up stuff to say yourself. As the makers of Cluely say, &#8220;Why memorize facts, write code, research <span class="italic">anything&#8212;</span>when a model can do it in seconds?&#8221;</p>
<p>This kind of technology&#8212;and the mentality behind it&#8212;is what educators are up against. Perhaps what humanity is up against.</p>
<p>The folks at Cluely have an interest in their clientele remaining clueless about the collective action problems accompanying their technology. They say, &#8220;If there&#8217;s a faster way to win&#8212;we&#8217;ll take it.&#8221; But what will actually happen if most people take it?</p>
<p>When you and your colleagues and clients and competitors are all communicating by parroting Cluely&#8217;s suggestions, where&#8217;s your advantage? When you and your date are telling each other what Cluely (and its in-app advertisers, no doubt) tells you to tell each other, does that sound like the kind of date you want to be on?</p>
<p>When we don&#8217;t need to have any facts at our command to make our way in the world, are we more powerful or more vulnerable?</p>
<p>Does any of this sound like winning? Perhaps to the people selling us Cluely.</p>
<p>Cluely isn&#8217;t the only firm that thinks it&#8217;s a smart marketing strategy to tell us they&#8217;ll be relieving us of the need to think. Here&#8217;s an ad from <a href="https://www.turing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing</a> on display at an airport:</p>

<p>Relatedly, below is a nice recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qoar03kU0k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public philosophy talk</a> by philosopher <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/benjaminmitchellyellin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Mitchell-Yellin</a> (Sam Houston State University) that&#8217;s worth watching and sharing, in which he makes the case for the value of asking, &#8220;Will using this AI tool really make my life better?&#8221; Good question.</p>
