<p>My girlfriend works for BYU SA—it&rsquo;s the division of BYU that&rsquo;s responsible for planning and running events. As part of her job, she has to review song lyrics and make sure that the song is okay to play at BYU functions.</p>
<p>This can get rather irksome. Imagine reading text <em>looking</em> for vulgar words or phrases. Yuck. I took some time this evening to write a little website that checks <a href="http://metrolyrics.com">MetroLyrics</a> for any vulgar words or phrases. I have an extensible blacklist which gets initialized at server start by some phrases from <a href="https://www.frontgatemedia.com/a-list-of-723-bad-words-to-blacklist-and-how-to-use-facebooks-moderation-tool/">FrontGate</a>.</p>
<p>I coded this up with <a href="http://mojolicious.org">Mojolicious</a> and <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org">Polymer Web Components</a>. Polymer might have been a little overkill, but it saved me from writing lots of boring jQuery to set variable.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the site looks like:</p>

<p>You can look at the code for the repository <a href="https://github.com/ashton314/sing_clearly">here</a>.</p>
<p>This all took about 3 hours, the last of which was spent mostly getting some of the finer points of the user interface to work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to get some contributions to my project, if anyone is feeling a little bored. ;-) Some more robust song searching would be nice, as well as better heuristics for bad phrases and whatnot.</p>
