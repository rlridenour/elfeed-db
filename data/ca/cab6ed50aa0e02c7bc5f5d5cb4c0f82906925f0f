<p><a href="https://irreal.org/blog/">Irreal</a> has recently published <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10784">a
post</a> with a reference to the Vernon
Grant&rsquo;s
<a href="https://github.com/VernonGrant/emacs-keyboard-shortcuts">emacs-keyboard-shortcuts</a>
README that contains a list of Emacs keyboard shortcuts Vernon uses on
a regular basis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth to bookmark it or to download the markdown README locally even
if you think you know Emacs very well (there is no such people,
though).</p>
<p>Many thanks to both Irreal and Vernon.</p>
