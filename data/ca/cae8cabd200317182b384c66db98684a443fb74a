<p>President Trump held a White House meeting with leaders from major oil and trading firms, urging them to help revive Venezuela’s damaged oil industry and aiming for roughly $100 billion in investment after U.S. actions that removed Nicolás Maduro from power. Trump said Washington would decide which companies can operate in Venezuela and promised participating firms “total safety”. Several executives signaled caution, with ExxonMobil’s chief executive describing Venezuela as “uninvestable” without major legal and political changes and noting past asset seizures. In parallel, Venezuelan authorities said they had begun an exploratory process with the United States to restore diplomatic relations, including discussions about reopening embassies.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/GjTYoNu5OrKbO1zCBFjL19-sQUOPnckUGDQxkegUq7D1Hqb8KrEtKbUyi-ZraCm1CUxNMzm2DFyrOCRPxhHsy9XlLK-_d0sn215c2k3ShwGkiCpvkmUpjye2gvvYVlagaTzoNwfe3WSRr95itdtRdcfe4Wr2rvk8fZlQ4oCENwBtfgfJl6AnkzSx6ddxuchCeMaWTawT40qccHeXVAKuUnzdndbL3NFD43SW75lUfRcC9jW-YQ' alt='President Trump meets oil industry executives at the White House in Washington, DC, on January 9, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Delegation to Caracas: U.S. officials traveled to Caracas to assess a potential phased resumption of U.S. embassy operations, while Venezuela said it would send a delegation to Washington as part of the exploratory talks.</li><li>Tanker boarding: U.S. forces boarded or seized the oil tanker Olina in a pre-dawn operation, described by officials as the fifth Venezuela-linked tanker action in recent weeks.</li><li>Ghost fleet risks: U.S. officials are preparing for practical port and safety challenges from seized “ghost fleet” vessels, with some ships described as being in poor condition and raising risks for U.S. ports.</li><li>Reflagging patterns: Analysts say some tankers have changed names and flags during interdictions, including one case described as switching to a Russian flag, reflecting broader “dark fleet” tactics to navigate restrictions.</li><li>Production baseline: Venezuela holds the world’s largest proven oil reserves but currently produces only about 1% of global supply, a gap analysts say reflects years of underinvestment and degraded infrastructure.</li></ul><blockquote>We’re going to discuss how these great American companies can help rapidly rebuild Venezuela’s dilapidated oil industry and bring millions of barrels of oil production to benefit the United States, the people of Venezuela and the entire world - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump and his administration: The White House says the U.S. will select which firms can operate in Venezuela and promises “total safety” for companies that invest, framing a rapid oil-sector rebuild as beneficial for Americans and Venezuelans alike.
