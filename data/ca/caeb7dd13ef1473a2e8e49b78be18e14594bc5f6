<hr>
<p><em>To the calendar enthusiast whose physical impairments prevent them from using analog tools — Most of this article will be irrelevant to you, but the spirit of it is this: to experience the same kind of mind-refreshing reset a hand drawn calendar gives me, you could try a <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/108-workflowy-text-calendar">plain text</a> calendar where each date is a Markdown subheading, and events are indented beneath.</em></p>

<p>I fell in love with the Wonderland222 planner last year after reading about it on <a href="https://analogoffice.net/2023/09/14/reader-question-can.html" target="_blank">Analog Office</a>. It’s a Japanese-inspired, USA-produced gem that I am happy to recommend to anyone looking for a ready-made planner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Planners, in essence, are calendars in notebook form. Some add room to make task lists, and some add a lot more, like pages for contact information, or goals, or inspirational quotes — but basically, a planner is just a portable calendar in notebook form. —Anna Havron</p>

<p>In September last year I pre-ordered one for AU$81 including shipping. For someone who’s been used to making their own that felt like a real extravagance! But I wanted it (oh, did I want it) so I took the plunge. It’s a 13 month planner and I’ve used five of those months, but the winds have changed. Again (it feels like a good Again, not an ominous one).</p>

<p>I’ve switched planners — both analog and digital — part way through the year more times than I can remember, but never with one this pricey. It’s a lovely, lovely planner and I still like it very much yet here I am, feeling that old familiar itch. An itch sparked by one of the partially filled Moleskine Cahier notebooks in my notebook box.</p>
<p>At the front of this old book is an experimental spread I drew up roughly in 2023 to try out some hand-drawn calendars. It is simple, rustic, and unpretentious, and the very essence of uncomplicated freedom I was — and am — drawn to.</p>

<hr>
<p>When a new idea grabs me, I have the tendency to sweep the table and start afresh. This is why I love the plain text life so much and why I’m drawn to simple analog systems: one can butterfly away with minimal disruption to the flow of things.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-how-it-works">This is how it works</h3>
<p>My notebook setup (for the next few months at least) consists of two Cahiers and a wad of single-sided scrap paper, all in a Paper Saver notebook. Two ancient leather Quiver pen holders serve nicely to carry an average black ballpoint pen (current model is from Typo, aka Cotton On in Australia), a Uni Kuru Toga self-rotating 0.5mm mechanical pencil, and an eraser pen whose body I wish came in more earthy tones.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/8998067d-fc9d-45ed-bd22-ad99c5f47881.png" alt="Black notebook, closed, with two tan leather pen holders strapped to the outside. there’s a bright blue eraser pen with a white cap and a mechanical pencil in the double pen holder on the front of the book, and a tan coloured clicky ballpoint pen in the holder that cradles the spine." width="1156" height="1226"></p>
<p><em>The fraying additional ribbon bookmark was cut from the inside shoulder seam of one of my jumpers (sweaters / pullovers). I may get around to neatening the edge one of these days.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The straps of the Quiver pen holders also keep two 80-page Moleskines in place at the front and back of the book. One of the Cahiers contains 6 monthly spreads followed by 26 weekly spreads, and the other is for general note making when I feel like writing in a book. The scrap paper is for throw-away scribblings, studying French vocab and grammar, drawing diagrams to give to other people, and for a pleasant sense of environmental responsibility.</p>

<hr>
<p>I view the non-planner Cahier as a type of <a href="https://ellanew.com/obtf"><span class="small-caps">OBTF</span> (One Big Text File)</a>. The premise is the same: add the date, then write whatever you want. I’m making use of the <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/126-dash-plus-system-in-obtf-and-analog-notes">dash plus system</a>, starting every note with a dash and modifying that dash to classify notes as needed.</p>
<h3 id="wonderland222-and-moleskine-pros-and-cons">Wonderland222 and Moleskine pros and cons</h3>
<p>The Wonderland222 has —</p>
<ul>
<li>➕ Understated grey grids with Hobonichi-sized squares</li>
<li>➕ Space for year, quarter, month, week, and daily plans</li>
<li>➕ Dates already in place</li>
<li>➕ Thin, watercolour and ink friendly Tomoe River paper</li>
<li>➖ ➕ Months spaced out amongst the weekly planning pages (not my preference)</li>
<li>➖ American holidays (many aren’t accurate or relevant in Australia)</li>
<li>➖ A hefty price tag</li>
<li>➖ Pressure to keep using the book because of the price (mustn’t waste that investment, sigh)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Moleskine Cahier has —</p>
<ul>
<li>➕ 6mm ruled lines that aren’t (usually) too dark or too light</li>
<li>➕ Rounded corners</li>
<li>➕ A cardboard cover that feels nice to the touch (unlike some shiny versions I’ve lived to regret buying)</li>
<li>➕ Card pocket at the back of the book</li>
<li>➕ Perforated pages at the back</li>
<li>➕ A reasonable price tag (I can get four for under AU$30 / US$20)</li>
<li>➕ No pressure to perform or fear of wastage (I’ve dipped in and out of these books countless times over the years)</li>
<li>➖ ➕ Stitched binding down the middle looks nice from the outside but means that pages near the front and back of the book are a teeny bit narrower than those around the centre</li>
<li>➖ ➕ No preprinted dates, structures or page numbers — an advantage when you have your own ideas in mind</li>
<li>➖ ➕ Moleskine pages are narrower than <span class="small-caps">A4</span>, but when taking a monthly or weekly grid right to the edge of the page the difference is negligible.</li>
<li>➖ Paper that can handle ball point and gel pens, but not wet inks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blinded-by-the-brand-no-way">Blinded by the brand? No way</h3>
<p>There’s something about the combination of features in the Cahier that works for me. I have not been able to find a comparable alternative anywhere else and believe me, I’ve looked.</p>
<p>No, I’m not blinded by the Moleskine brand and its associations with creative minds from a bygone era. There really <em>is</em> something special in the 6 mm ruled lines, the rounded corners, the feel of the cover, and those lovely chunky stitches down the middle!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/a1fd24b0-2e98-43cf-bd57-e3df9f257f92.png" alt="Two side by side photos of Moleskine Cahier notebooks showing a weekly and monthly spread respectively, hand drawn in black ballpoint pen and pencil" width="2262" height="1458"> <em>Hand drawn calendar layouts.

<p>And so this week I’ve lent into the delicious insanity of creating my own planner entirely by hand, right there in a fresh Moleskine Cahier. Drawing up a week or two at a time while watching <span class="small-caps">TV</span> or listening to podcasts means it hasn’t been arduous; more of a soothing activity that helps quieten my brain monkeys in much the same way as knitting or sewing something simple.</p>
<div class="right margin">
There will be no failures, no right or wrong, simply data that will tell me something I did not know before
</div>
<p>Cahiers only have 80 pages (40 sheets) in them, meaning I’ll need two to cover a full year. Perhaps in 6 months I’ll be onto something else, but that’s the beauty of a flexible system! You’re never fenced in.</p>
<p>The structure of monthly and weekly pages echo the approach followed in the Wonderland222, and other <span class="small-caps">A5</span> vertical left-to-right weekly planners. It’s a simple and effective way to plan the week.</p>
<h3 id="a-joyful-tiny-stationery-experiment">A joyful tiny stationery experiment</h3>
<p>Anne-Laure le Cunff would call this a <a href="https://nesslabs.com/book" target="_blank">tiny experiment</a>, because that’s what it is: a happy, curiosity-driven exercise in seeing what happens when I use this kind of analog calendar.</p>
<p>How will I respond to it over time? Will I miss the grid of the Wonderland222? Will seeing my own hand as a foundation for planning focus me more on the work, or be a distraction? Will my gut welcome the hand drawn layouts each morning before my brain has switched into analytical mode, or rebel against them? I can hardly wait to find out!</p>
<p>There will be no failures, no right or wrong, simply data that will tell me something I did not know before. And that data will shape what comes next. Now that I’m aware of shiny object syndrome and have learned how to keep it from changing the overall trajectory of my productivity, exercises like this are a mind-refreshing, fun reset!
