Over at <a href="https://perfectdays23.substack.com">Perfect Days</a>, Padraig <a href="https://perfectdays23.substack.com/p/steve-jobs-cabinet">has a post that really resonated with me</a>. He begins by quoting Steve Jobs on cabinet making. Jobs says that a real craftsman wouldn&rsquo;t use a piece of plywood on the back of a beautiful cabinet even though it will be against the wall and no one will ever see it. The thing is, according to Jobs, is that the carpenter will know it&rsquo;s there and that it would be an insult to his aesthetic sensibilities.

Padraig remembered this quote when he took apart a MacBook Pro to replace a speaker. He was struck by how elegant its construction was. It was the same principle. Hardly anyone would ever see the inside of the computer but it was still built as if it was visible to all.

This commitment to excellence, even when it&rsquo;s not visible is, to me, the essence of good engineering. Not meeting a deadline. Not meeting some arbitrary Wall Street expectation. Not making a fortune in the marketplace. But being able to sleep at night knowing the thing you built is as beautiful inside as it as outside. That&rsquo;s what we mean by great engineering.

Sadly, I think we&rsquo;ve lost some of that. Maybe it&rsquo;s just a matter of being a geezer and wanting kids to get off my lawn but I see less and less of that commitment. I&rsquo;d guess that that&rsquo;s because many people no longer think of programming as a craft but as just another job to get through with the least amount of pain. To be sure, the urgency to get the product out the door no matter what was always there but <i>in the old days</i><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> there was more push back from engineering, Now, many don&rsquo;t seem to care. It&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t have nice things.</p>
