<li>Turn it on and wait 15 minutes</li>
<li>Then, it provides a 20-foot zone of protection</li>
<li>Diffuses odorless repellent to keep you safe from mosquito bites</li>
<li>Is it available in Georgia Red: No, but if you forget to turn it on, you might end up with some Georgia Red welts on your arms, legs, neck, and forehead</li>
</ul><h1>Step Out, Comfortably</h1><p>A blizzard, a thunderstorm, a dense fog–these kinds of weather conditions can be tough to contend with, but at least they’re honest. You look at the window, and you say, “Yikes, it’s gonna be hard to get outside while that’s going on.”</p>
<p>The day in the middle of January? When it’s 10 below, but the sun is shining? It can be a bit misleading, but the dead, gray landscape gives away the game.</p>
<p>The mid-July day, on the other hand, when the sun is shining except for the occasional moments when it ducks behind the clouds, and the grass is green, and the flowers are in bloom… and also it’s 93 degrees outside and humidity is hanging at a thick 86%?</p>
<p>Those are the days of true deception.</p>
<p>And yet, they provide a brief window of delightful outside time. That window just before and just after sundown.</p>
<p>Sure, it might still be a bit hot, but isn’t that nice? Without the sun beating directly down on you, a little summer heat and a little summer humidity can feel exhilarating. Assuming you’re sitting on your deck, enjoying a cold beverage, whether it be something boozy and extravagant or just a tall glass of ice water.</p>
<p>The only issue?</p>
<p>There’s another group that enjoys this time as an opportunity to emerge from their homes and sip on something. And their preferred beverage? It’s your blood.</p>
<p>Of course, we’re talking about mosquitoes.</p>
<p>It’s the worst, right? You get through a workday, come home, put dinner on the table, do the dishes, and all you want is to just chill out and watch the sunset, and these little fucks come buzzing in to ruin everything. And that’s if you even realize they’re there. Maybe worse is when you enjoy a night on the deck and then later find yourself itching all over because your whole arm has been covertly chewed up.</p>
<p>Well, this thing can help.</p>
<p>All you need to do is turn it on, and within 15 minutes it’ll start diffusing odorless repellent to provide a 20-foot zone of protection. No weird smells, no annoying sprays, no mosquitoes. Plus, it looks nice with its ambient dimmable light.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s perfect for keeping you comfortable when you want to enjoy a little time outside at dusk.</p>
<p>So get one. And if you’ve ever used it, let us know your thoughts in the comments.</p>
