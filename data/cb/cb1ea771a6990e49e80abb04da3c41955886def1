<p>Paul Kafasis, on a seemingly local-to-Boston Genmoji billboard from Apple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eventually, though, the penny dropped. After my umpteenth time
passing the billboard, while trying to distract myself from the
single-digit temperatures and the brutal wind chill, I realized
what I’d been missing. That’s not just a basketball-playing
<s>foul</s> fowl.</p>

<p>You see, the Last Tenement is located just a few hundred feet from
TD Garden, home arena for the <a href="https://onefoottsunami.com/2024/06/18/by-the-numbers-the-celtics-2024-championship/">reigning NBA champion</a>
Boston Celtics. The Celtics have had many <a href="https://onefoottsunami.com/2022/08/01/far-more-than-a-great-basketball-player/">great players</a>
over the years, but only one had the last name “Bird”. Yes, this
billboard is surely an allusion to the Hick from French Lick,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird">Larry Bird</a>.</p>

<p>It was obvious once I finally saw it, and I was so amused that I
went by with my phone to snap the above pic. At that point, I
noticed that the cartoon’s basketball jersey even seems to feature
Larry Legend’s #33. It’s cut off, perhaps in the hopes of avoiding
a lawsuit, but those numbers really can’t be anything else.</p>

<p>I can’t believe Kafasis didn’t recognize the caricature immediately, but he’s a bit younger than me and didn’t grow up like I did, familiarizing myself with the early 1980s “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/familiar-birds-of-north-america.jpeg">Familiar Birds of North America</a>” illustrated guide from ... <em>checks notes</em> ...
