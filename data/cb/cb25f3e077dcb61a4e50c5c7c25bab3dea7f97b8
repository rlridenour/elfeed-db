<blockquote><p>
A Philosopher seeing a Fool beating his Donkey, said:</p>
<p>&#8216;Abstain, my son, abstain, I implore. Those who resort to violence shall suffer from violence.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;That,&#8217; said the Fool, diligently belaboring the animal, &#8216;is what I&#8217;m trying to teach this beast &#8212; which has kicked me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Doubtless,&#8217; said the Philosopher to himself, as he walked away, &#8216;the wisdom of fools is no deeper nor truer than ours, but they really do seem to have a more impressive way of imparting it.&#8217;
