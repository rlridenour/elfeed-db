Apple today confirmed it will not be allowing customers to trade in the original Vision Pro toward the purchase of the new model or any other device.<br/>

"Apple Vision Pro is not eligible for trade-in," says Apple, in the fine print of a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/new-ipad-pro-14-inch-macbook-pro-and-apple-vision-pro-now-available/">press release</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Some customers who spent at least &#36;3,499 on the original Vision Pro may be disappointed to learn that Apple is not willing to offer any credit for the device.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">new Vision Pro</a>'s key changes include an M5 chip, 120Hz support, and the inclusion of a more comfortable Dual Knit Band in the box. However, the Dual Knit Band is also compatible with the original Vision Pro, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/new-accessories-for-vision-pro-now-available/">can be purchased separately</a> for &#36;99.<br/>
<br/>
The original model has an M2 chip, up to a 100Hz refresh rate, and a Solo Knit Band.<br/>
<br/>
With no trade-in credit available to offset spending another &#36;3,499 on the updated Vision Pro, some customers may pass on upgrading to the new model. Alternatively, customers can sell the device privately on platforms like eBay or Facebook Marketplace. <br/>
<br/>
The updated Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/m5-macbook-pro-ipad-pro-vision-pro-now-available/">launched in Apple Stores</a> and began arriving to customers today.<br/>
<br/>
At all Apple Store locations where the Vision Pro is available, customers can now demo the model with the M5 chip, and try the Dual Knit Band.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/apple-confirms-no-vision-pro-trade-ins/">Apple Confirms Vision Pro is Not Eligible for Trade-In</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-vision-pro-is-not-eligible-for-trade-in.2469603/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
