<p>Dozens of Indigenous protesters staged a sit-in blocking the main entrance to COP30 in Belém, Brazil on Friday to press the government and delegates to halt development in the Amazon and recognise Indigenous rights, forcing some delegates to use alternate entry points while security increased. Protesters said they were calling for an end to mining, logging, oil drilling and a proposed railway that would move agricultural and mining products, framing their action as protection of the rainforest and indigenous territories. Organisers and high-level officials engaged with representatives to defuse the blockade as Indigenous voices gained heightened visibility at the summit, where organisers say Indigenous participation is unusually large this year.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/6nP8L3XLb3wAhIwxAeKYl3FChsqEXJy1cCLorrzaFG3_HDxakrjZcS8dtskxRmWvCJlrmeumLZ96LI76hBjVbSyyCtKMtR7SbRZpINQ_JUjtdGe1S3DOU20LXESgmXdhnQJ_NigCCIJgDz9rjU2UlGiu-CbUCZMTaepV1dgfxtVXhzHaHSpurW0slx6nQY6NlFmBth9a2Kn9RJ4LqONRW39HmEQ' alt='An Indigenous rights demonstration on Thursday in Belém, Brazil.
