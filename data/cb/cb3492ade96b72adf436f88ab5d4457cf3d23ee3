<p>Rapper Nicki Minaj, who was born in Trinidad and Tobago, publicly endorsed US President Donald Trump, calling herself his “number one fan” and defending him against what she described as “smear campaigns” by opponents. The comments, amplified by broadcast coverage, place a major pop-culture figure directly into a polarized US political conversation. The coverage also spotlighted a contrast in celebrity responses to Trump-era immigration enforcement: while Minaj praised the President and showcased a so-called “gold card” visa, musician Bruce Springsteen was reported as protesting about ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement). Together, the episodes underline how high-profile entertainers can shape public attention around politics and immigration—sometimes by supporting leaders, sometimes by contesting government policies.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/jOshYqi4SkshrkhyVRFc0r78Pk699f3P-JXTOAp7PXTFfy4Cgbc2iyI1FwGriDjWHsKzFUAd0_F_2Y-RBGXzbdjthjuGVidPrw564nu9JAZW1sLxKgYq-DkYXR9dY2uKYzQd4Gjkc031B8YbkytVPv1ssGK6bukPvpzBbuvJh1pbLOGoUm1yoQHBdWxxGVJF' alt='A photo used alongside coverage of Nicki Minaj backing President Trump.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Defending Trump: Minaj said she would not let the President’s opponents “get away with bullying him,” framing her support as a response to what she called “smear campaigns”.</li><li>Immigration spotlight: BBC linked Minaj’s pro-Trump moment to wider debate over immigration enforcement by noting Springsteen’s reported protest about ICE.</li><li>Broadcast amplification: FRANCE 24 circulated Minaj’s “number one fan” remark in a short video segment, illustrating how fast celebrity political statements travel internationally.</li></ul><blockquote>I’m not going to let these people get away with bullying him and you know, the smear campaigns.
