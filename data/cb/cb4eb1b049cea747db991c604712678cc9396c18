<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a> suggests that Apple is indeed working on a new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> that could be coming in the not too distant future. Code in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://x.com/stevemoser">Steve Moser</a> references the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a>" alongside the "&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;" and the "&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2."<br/>

There is no &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; at the current time, but rumors suggest that Apple plans to introduce a new model this fall. The reference is buried in a headphone-related UI framework, so Apple appears to be preparing for the upcoming product launch behind the scenes.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't actually the first time Apple has hinted at &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;. Last month, Apple <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1922731957890232570">changed a reference</a> to the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; to the "&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 or later," even though there is no "later" right now.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-3/">will have a new look</a> for the earbuds and the case, with Apple perhaps slimming down the case like it did for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>. We're also counting on a faster audio chip that brings improved Active Noise Cancellation and audio quality, plus the updated earbuds might offer heart rate monitoring functionality and temperature sensing.<br/>
