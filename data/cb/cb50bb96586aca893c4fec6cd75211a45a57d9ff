</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
In which we establish our realm and we first meet Knight-Errant Sir Weydlyn, his helmed steed Ingot, and Squire Kelwum.
</p>
        <p class="verse">

<p>I’m going to start playing a solo campaign of <cite><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514996/mythic-bastionland?affiliate_id=318171">Mythic Bastionland</a></cite> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Mythic Bastionland”" title="Other site-wide references of “Mythic Bastionland”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-MYTHIC-BASTIONLAND">&#128214;</a></small>
.  I’ll be using
<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
 to manage the campaign.</p>
<p>For my knight, I rolled up The Forge Knight; one knighted by The Worst Seer.  I
opted for a Knight-Errant and have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guard:</strong> 6</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> 5</li>
<li><strong>Spirit:</strong> 3</li>
<li><strong>Vigor:</strong> 17</li>
<li><strong>Glory:</strong> 0</li>
<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Bolt-guisarme (d10 long in melee or d10 slow ranged)</li>
<li><strong>Armor:</strong> Gambeson (A1), Scale (A1)</li>
<li><strong>Scars:</strong> blistered face; noise sensitivy</li>
<li><strong>Steed:</strong> Ingot, Helmed steed (VIG 14, CLA 4, SPI 5, 4GD, d6 trample, A1)</li>
<li><strong>Passion:</strong> Burning; restore SPI when you are wounded by fire.</li>
<li><strong>Ability:</strong> Tempering Strike: when you cause a Wound with a melee weapon, that
weapon receives +d8 until the end of combat.  This effect can stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>I named this bruiser Sir Weydlyn and rolled up Squire Kelwum to accompany him:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guard:</strong> 1</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> 9</li>
<li><strong>Spirit:</strong> 8</li>
<li><strong>Vigor:</strong> 8</li>
<li><strong>Steed:</strong> Pony (VIG 7, CLA 7, SP 2, 2GD)</li>
<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> dagger (d6); three javelins (d6)</li>
<li><strong>Upbringing:</strong> They were raised in a pious environment and carry memories of an
execution.</li>
<li><strong>Constraint:</strong> They will not eat meat.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m referencing Plimbort’s guidance on <a href="https://plimbort.itch.io/solo-for-mythic-bastionland">Solo for Mythic Bastionland</a>; of which as
the player, I know the general map of the realm, but am oblivious to where other
things might be.  I’ll instead use procedures to <em>play to find out</em> .</p>
<p>Unlike the guidance of the solo-play, I chose to roll up the starting myths;
though I only looked up the page so as to bookmark them.  I got the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Beast</li>
<li>the Fortress</li>
<li>the Judge</li>
<li>the Lich</li>
<li>the Mountain</li>
<li>the Wall</li>
</ul>
<p>I used the <a href="https://mythic.bastionland.tools/map">Realm Map</a> to generate a campaign for my suiting.  What I like about
this map is that there’s a major arterial river running north/south.  Something
that might facilitate travel.</p>

<figure  aria-hidden="true"><figcaption><p>A map of the Realm that Sir Weydlyn swore to protect.</p>

  <img src="https://takeonrules.com/images/forged-from-the-worst--campaign-map_hu_960bdbeff0c1c0b1.png" alt="" data-original-url="https://takeonrules.com/images/forged-from-the-worst--campaign-map.png" width="770" height="923" data-width="770" data-height="923" />
</figure>

<p>Per the solo recommendations, I don’t know the locations of the staring Myth,
Landmarks, nor Barriers.  I’m also going to treat the river as a barrier; there
will be bridges for crossing, but not in every hex.</p>
<h2 id="setting-the-initial-situation">Setting the Initial Situation</h2>
<p>From the solo rules, I looked at the starting point and tossed a d6 to see how
Sir Weydlyn and Squire Kelwum starts… <em>a skirmish with bandits</em>.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> The text is “Roll on the <em>Soldier</em> <em>Spark</em> tables.  Will a nearby holding or dwelling be glad to see them gone, or wroth to have their raiders killed?”<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>Rolling on the <em>Sparks &gt; Combat &gt; Soldier</em> table I get <em>Fancy Scout(s)</em>.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> Read that again…Fancy Scouts.  Perhaps a Fancy Scout of Cornwood?<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
 How
many (1d6): 6.  Looking at <em>Warfare</em> I don’t see “scouts” but figure “skirmishers”
work: Vigor 10, Clarity 13, Spirit 10, 2GD, Shortbow (d6 long).<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> Yikes to archers.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>Now which holding?  The <em>Tower</em> in the northeast corner…we’ll name that in a bit.</p>
<p>And how close?  I’ll roll a d6; on a 1–2 it is the hex of the <em>Tower</em>; 3–5
adjacent hex; 6 two hexes away.  I get an adjacent hex, and roll it is the
grey plains to the northwest (coordinates <code>8,1</code>).<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> Note to self, I’m going to need a way of better tracking these things.
Perhaps a sheet of paper?  For now, coordinates are easier.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>I review the Basic Rules.  And think a bit about the situation.  The question
implies that combat has started.  I wonder, why did Sir Weydlyn and Squire
Kelwum engage these <em>fancy scouts</em>?  Let’s <em>Ask the Stars</em> …The Elder (authority -
tradition) Bowed (submission - mercy).  Maybe they are threatening a <em>Seer</em>?
Seems likely, let’s again <em>Ask the Stars</em> …and yes they are.</p>
<p>I grab a d12 and d6, getting the <em>Tangled Seer</em>.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> They are not quite here, but also too much of them is here.  Appears as

</small>
 Perhaps outside their humble
academy.</p>
<h2 id="skirmish-with-the-fancy-bandits">Skirmish with the Fancy Bandits</h2>
<p>Sir Weydlyn and his squire having begun their journey into this mythic realm,
traveling upon the grey plains.  Near a copse of ash trees in bloom, they note
six riding horses tethered up; adorned in finery, yet unattended.  A cry of help
and cursing erupts in the distance, coming from beyond the horses.</p>
<p>“Come good Kelwum, something is amiss,” says Weydlyn as he spurs Ingot forward,
“I hope we are not too late.”  As they trot around the copse, through the waist
high grasses, and see cleared land surrounding a small building, with a bell
raised high on ashen beam.</p>
<p>Between Sir Weydlyn and the building, somewhat scattered, are five men with
short bows unbent.  A sixth with walks amidst them with torch looking to light
the arrows.  All dressed in finery matching those of the horses.</p>
<p>“You foul brigands, this fine academy, shall not submit,” rages a voice within
the academy.</p>
<p>“Then, I’m afraid, we shall make a pyre of you and yours,” howls the voice of
the man with the firebrand.</p>
<p>Sir Weydlyn’s eyes catch the firelight, and a grim smile bends his face.  From
trot to gallop, Weydlyn brandishes his bolt-guisarme, prepared to run over these
bandits.  “Kelwum, stay back, and should one escape give chase,” orders Sir
Weydlyn, as he prepares for the clash.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>
Sir Weydlyn’s brings 1d10 (bolt-guisarme) + 1d6 (trample) dice and opts to
invoke the <i class="dfn">Smite</i> feat to gain Blast.  Can he hit them all with a blast?  I <i class="dfn">Ask
the Stars</i> and get a yes.  Here comes the slop.
</small></p>
<p><small>

</dl>
<p><small>
And Weydlyn makes his <i class="dfn">Save</i> after using <i class="dfn">Smite</i>.  And Weydlyn has wounded 4
bandits.  That bolt-guisarme is going to be quite dangerous.
</small></p>

</section>

<p>Grim determination sets Weydlyn in motion, charging into the archers, themselves
confused, as they turn to face Ingot and Weydlyn explode amidst them.  Weydlyn’s
bolt-guisarme piercing in a flury, as though a hot poker stoking the coals of a
fire.  Ingot bashing and trampling, twisting the ankle of one as they avoid the
worst of Ingot’s wrath.  The others maintain their wits as they back away from
Weydlyn and the helmed Ingot.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>Consulting the rules, I see a call for a <i class="dfn">Wavering Morale</i>, check on Bandits 2, 3,
and 4.  Amazingly they all succeed.  Bandit 2, 3, 4 move back and fire hoping
that bandit 6 can pull Weydlyn from his horse.  I grab 3d6 + 1d4 and roll: 1, 1,
3, 4.  Their hope rests in unhorsing Weydlyn.  So they inflict 3 damage;
reducing Weylynd’s Guard from 6 to 3.  And the Gambit fails as Sir Weydlyn
succeeds at his save.</small></p>
</section>

<p>With wits about them, those with shortbows scatter, one limping along.  And they
hastily turn and fire, distracting Sir Weydlyn as the brigand with the fire
brand attempts to pull Weydlyn down.  Weydlyn feels the tug as Ingot pivots
breaking the tenuous grapple of the brigand.  Weydlyn bellows a laugh, “I am Sir
Weydlyn, I offer no quarter nor assume any shall be given.”<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> This line came to me, as I realized the Sir Weydlyn offers only the fury of
the fire.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>The <i class="dfn">Blast</i> option of <i class="dfn">Smite</i> is not available, so Sir Weydlyn needs to pick them
off one at a time.  I roll 1d10+4d8+1d6, netting: 8,7,6,5,5,1.  That’s 7 base
damage plus 3 for <i class="dfn">Bolster</i> and a <i class="dfn">Strong Gambit</i> for no save.  Someone’s soaking 10
damage.</small></p>
</section>

<p>Making good on his grim declaration, he spurs Ingot towards the bandit already
limping.  Running him down, leaving a ruin of bone and blood.  “Brigands and
bandits, know this, I Sir Weydlyn have sworn a sacred oath to protect the realm.
And I deem you a most wicked of threat to this glorious realm.”</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>With half of their ranks fallen, I again check for <i class="dfn">Wavering Morale</i>.  There’s no
real leader individual rolls.  Rolling 11, 18, 19, the remaining all fail.</small></p>
</section>

<p>From the corner of Weydlyn’s eye, he sees Squire Kelwun and his pony ride after
one of the bandits.  Weydlyn hears Kelwun’s <em>melodic</em> voice shout, “halt and I
shall claim you as my captive, your life shall be mine to spare.”  The one
bandit quickly drops to his knees and begs, accepting this chance of safety.</p>
<p>As the other two bandits plead, with cracking voices, “We submit to you, oh
merciful one.”  Weydlyn curses under his breath, a hiss as though water poured
over his hot iron heart.</p>
<p>“Very well Squire Kelwun, these are your prisoners,” proclaims Weydlyn as he
dismounts and approaches the dropped firebrand, watching as the flame sputters
against the damp spring grasses.</p>
<p>“And I do so hope that these caged birds will sing of why they attacked this
academy,” barks Weydlyn as he drives his boot into the smouldering fire brand;
his heart yearning that this were instead the dried thatch of harvest time.</p>
<h2 id="the-tangled-seer">The Tangled Seer</h2>
<p>Weydlyn winces as the small bell rings, piercing his reverie.  He shifts his
head, teeth clenched and looks upon a confusion of a man, fussing and flapping,
as though himself tethered to the bell.</p>
<p>“Sir Weydlyn, I am Tompot, at least so I’m told, and you have, I believe—yes, I
think—saved me and perhaps, most probably, my academy…well the realms academy…if
they might claim it,” bumbled the man as he found his ill-fitting clothes now
tangled on the bell chord.  All efforts to untangle, being met by both a
piercing ring, and further ensnarement.</p>
<p>Sir Weydlyn, bites his lip, breaths deep, and dismounts, walking towards the
bell.  His walk a chainmail song.  “Here, let me help,” growls Sir Weydlyn, as
he draws his dagger, Tompot wincing for a moment, then noticing the blade cut
the chord; freeing Tompot from one tether, though finding himself now caught in
what looks like twice as many clothes—none well-fitting.</p>
<p>“Ah, thank you again for rescuing me.  Though…perhaps this is not a good thing,”
replies Tompot, as he stops moving, letting his clothes settle, as though a pine
tree laden with heavy wet winter snow, “as I have said, you have saved me and
this academy.  How shall I reward you?  Ah, you a knight of the realm, your
squire as yet unpledged.  Yes, what might I a humble school master give?”</p>
<p>“You know my oaths,” states Sir Weydlyn, speaking slower, as to not sound
irritated, “answer me true, are you a Seer?”</p>
<p>“I have been known to be that.  Yes,” replies Tompot, furrowing his brow as
though a thought shattered as glass upon stone.  “Yes, at least until this day
ends, I’m a seer.”</p>
<p>Drawing a deep, cooling breath, Weydlyn begins, “Then I ask nothing more of you
than to know of what plagues realm.  For I am oathbound to protect this realm.”</p>
<p>“Nothing more than what ails this realm?” asks Tompot, lucid in his confusion regarding Weydlyn’s response.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” affirms Sir Weydlyn.</p>
<p>For a moment, Tompot’s face twists as though beard and brow were in a row, then
in a clear and certain voice he speaks in verse<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> The five lines are the lines of verse from each of the <em>Myths</em>.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
:</p>
<p class="verse">
In cutting coil and snatching horn and crushing limb abound<br />
Tameless creature sees no knight, no seer, no king a’found<br />
<br />
A cage in stone, all thorned and vast<br />
Disguise a scheme in shadows cast<br />
<br />
In time she calls for all the knights<br />
Upon the best her blade still bites<br />
<br />
From fable’s heart springs fable’s fear, a past within a past<br />
From time before our nightmares still, made flesh by sullen mass<br />
<br />
Cutting through the land, a wonder two storms tall<br />
Guarding from invasion, or built to cage us all<br />
<br />
How earth ajoys to lay frailty bare<br />
Render us small in its coldstone stare<br />
</p>
<p>While listening to the recitation Sir Weydlyn catches himself, wanting to
interrupt and hurry on this doddering Seer.  And when Tompot finish, Weydlyn’s
wrath boils over, “You twisted man in riddles speak,” simmering down he
continues, “…oh I spoke in haste and do apologize, as my ears and mind fail to
unwind your riddled verse.  Of those you speak, I wish to know more of this
timeless creature.  Where might I find it?”</p>
<p>“Now that is a bit more than you first asked, though I guessed as much and said
as less.  For our score is settled and were I to yield more, I require less…
less visitors from that cursed castle to the south west.  These men, they insist
on bringing messages and knowledge new, as though to barter for visions and
knowledge held.”</p>
<p>Sir Weydlyn, releases his held breath, as though opening the furnace door, “I
can travel there and issue your demands, though I don’t know what sway I hold.”</p>
<p>“All I ask, is that you ask.  Now go, then return and I’ll tell you more,”
commands Tompot.</p>
<p>“Good Tompot, share this little truth before I depart, and I do so <em>swear</em> that I
shall deliver your demands and petition those of the castle to take heed.”<small class="side-container">

Looking at Weydlyn’s virtues, convincing someone might be a bit of a challenge.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>Tompot writhes, again twisting and undulating within his clothes, as though many
snakes sought to spill from these robes, “Very well, I accept your <em>Promise</em>.  And
give you this look for the fell beast on the western shores of the silver lake
south east of here.”</p>
<p>Sir Weydlyn bows deeply, “Thank you Tompot, I shall leave you this morning and
make haste for the castle.  Kelwun, are your prisoners bound by oath or leather,
for we must ride to the castle.”</p>
<p>“Sir, there’s a tower nearby, surely we could first take <em>the</em>
prisoners…”</p>
<p>“<em>Your</em> prisoners Kelwum.  Yours!”</p>
<p>“Yes, my prisoners,” continues Kelwum, “and perhaps there’s justice or reward
offered in the tower.  I’ve bound my prisoners hands, they’ll walk.  We should
also get their horses.”</p>
<p>Sir Wydlyn growls eyeing the noon day sun.  “Listen Kelwum’s prisoners, to
attempt escape is to forfeit your life.  We make for the tower.”</p>
