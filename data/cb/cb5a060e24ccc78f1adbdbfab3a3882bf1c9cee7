<p id="p2"><strong><a href="https://bzgapps.com/quip?utm_source=macstories&amp;utm_medium=sponsor_post" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quip</a></strong> is a supercharged clipboard manager and text expander for Mac, iPhone, and iPad&mdash;built to feel perfectly native, fast, and private.</p>
<p id="p3">Most clipboard apps turn into junk drawers. Quip is different. You choose how items get saved: capture everything, or enable <strong>Only Copy on Shortcut</strong> so your archive stays intentional. Then <strong>Quip Intelligence</strong> (secure, on-device AI) cleans things up&mdash;fixing broken links, removing tracking parameters, normalizing messy text, keeping code formatting intact, avoiding duplicates, and more. It even learns from your behavior to automatically avoid items you likely wish to ignore. <strong>Quip OCR lets you copy text from anywhere</strong> on your Mac&rsquo;s screen - even if it is not normally copyable.</p>
<p id="p4">Your history is beautiful and searchable, with filters for app, type, and date. Organize with Collections (including <strong>Smart Collections that auto-sort</strong> by rules). When you need to act, <strong>Super Shortcuts paste anything</strong>&mdash;signatures, links, snippets&mdash;just by typing a trigger, anywhere on your Mac.</p>
<p id="p5">Quip works across your devices with iCloud sync and includes <strong>Quip Keyboard on iOS</strong> so your items are always a tap away. It&rsquo;s privacy-first, with granular content rules (ignore apps or keywords, or strip sensitive terms) and full control over retention.</p>
<p id="p6">If you live in copy/paste all day, Quip makes it fast, thoughtful, and actually enjoyable.</p>
