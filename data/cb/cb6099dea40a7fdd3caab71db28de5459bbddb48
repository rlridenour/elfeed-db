</ul><h1>Retail Fatigue: a Meh-rathon</h1><p>Nobody enjoys mainstream Black Friday anymore. It’s a month-long marathon of disappointment and deeply questionable deals. So let’s get this out of the way early and with minimal effort. (Our deals are legit, at least.)</p>
<p>The offer: 4-Pack: HOST 18oz Ice Cream Freeze Bowls</p>
<p>Is this THE gift of the holiday season?? It might be—for anyone who takes ice cream properly seriously. For everyone else, it’s still a delightfully unnecessary luxury.</p>
<p>Why you should grab one regardless: Because nobody wants to wait for a bowl to chill when dessert is a survival mechanism this time of year.</p>
