<p>One of the apps I was thinking of (but didn’t mention) when writing about <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2025/03/a-mac-smart-quote-curiosity/">smart quotes on the Mac</a> was the Mastodon app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mona-for-mastodon/id1659154653">Mona</a>. While the iOS version of Mona handles smart quotes as expected, the Mac version doesn’t. This was particularly annoying as I started tweeting<sup id="fnref:tweet"><a href="#fn:tweet" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> more from my Mac.</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering, yes, I did have the <span class="menu">Substitutions</span> setting in the <span class="menu">Edit</span> set correctly. Toggling it on and off and even restarting my Mac didn’t fix the problem. Mona kept the quotes straight no matter what.</p>

<p>Rather than complaining about Mona in that post—which was really about how Apple apps handle smart quotes differently—I sent a bug report to Mona’s developer. Never got a reply, not even the typical “we’ve received your message and will get back to you” auto-reply. Kind of annoying.</p>
<p>But last week I noticed there’s a beta for Mona—you can get a link to it in the “About Mona” section of its Settings—so I downloaded it and gave it a try. Boom. Smart quotes work in the beta, so that’s what I’ll be using until Version 7 is officially released. And I’m going to consider the beta to be the response to my bug report.</p>

<p>I don’t like “toot,” and since Twitter is no longer called Twitter, I think “tweet” is fair game for us to use with any Twitter-like app. <a href="#fnref:tweet" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
