<p>President Trump’s “Board of Peace,” initially presented as part of a Gaza ceasefire and postwar rebuilding framework, is being broadened into a wider diplomatic forum as his administration invites scores of countries to participate. On Jan. 21, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would join, even after earlier objections about the board’s Gaza-related executive committee. Several Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and the UAE, also announced decisions to sign on, framing their participation as support for implementing the Gaza plan and sustaining a permanent ceasefire and reconstruction effort. Some European governments have responded cautiously or said they will not participate, and diplomats and critics warn the initiative could undercut the United Nations’ role in conflict resolution.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/G8XfHNOfScDrDviyHwqZ1rayBRx3YDjExkHErpMRh15Vobo0BFNg5LoAUaIjt_Uooyicc0nS_kKiHQcaGPe-DTVaoZ5sVLG9kRQPBoVJ8KRWlPROHgav0xcWifoqFmba01L1g6vdtHZyrVsx5sbYY_KnkDOxBimTlM5jjjm-wR00fow3HNlEwNwyGzeR0xi21k-TXtwF4o_y4BWe8XDpDrizG66J0EuNiyObRUuHn7eGLQMcVH-L2fYLwh88iwSzOooQAC_dlMbw6kQviqRDV4pRaTc8Jh3QaDNQ' alt='President Trump at a Gaza ceasefire signing ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt (Oct. 2025).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Membership mechanics: A charter described by AFP indicates members may pay up to $1 billion for a permanent seat, and the board would be chaired by President Trump, who would also “separately serve” as the U.S. representative.</li><li>Gaza executive group: President Trump also proposed a “Gaza Executive Board” operating under the wider body, with names reported to include Turkey’s foreign minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi—an arrangement Netanyahu has objected to.</li><li>Cautious allies: Public reaction has been tentative in several capitals, with NPR reporting apprehension among some invitees and noting that a number of European countries have declined to join so far.</li><li>Unexpected yeses: Reuters reporting cited by multiple outlets says some states with long-strained ties to Washington, including Belarus, have accepted invitations, alongside U.S. partners such as Morocco.</li><li>Davos spotlight: President Trump is expected to discuss the initiative further at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where participating leaders and details of the expanded concept may be clarified.</li></ul><blockquote>Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that he has accepted US President Donald Trump’s invitation and will join as a member of the Board of Peace, which will be composed of leaders of the world - Benjamin Netanyahu (statement from his office)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: The board began as a Gaza-focused mechanism but is now being pitched as a broader forum to broker conflicts beyond the Middle East.
