The White House says President Trump has been actively discussing buying the territory and has not ruled out military force, while also stressing he remains committed to NATO. Danish politicians and officials say the island is not for sale and describe U.S. rhetoric as alarming for an ally, with some warning it could severely strain NATO’s cohesion.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/cXd0P-M8yLoix0GV08qrXsYX9ohowXXtEOZMXWXvsHFcYq85aaK75L4W0EZrpNLYue2xmiZtMxs8J2e_RhgESd4mLmw1BGTpg-IkytSJF9PvKuv_KH32Xe4SUOdFIDAxeR1ij_iIRh1pruzEgINU-nwgSOktqolGRD1SHaVnVnMvxvMXnvGRDIRwlACiIeX3icQcxIw82B3b6XaqXMmI2fHK0h71SlCaqavovRsRhEBxTaVM2StJIY6DnGHo3Sr40GJ2rVacqg_rp8Nclw' alt='Coloured houses covered with snow, seen from the sea in Nuuk, Greenland, on March 6, 2025.
