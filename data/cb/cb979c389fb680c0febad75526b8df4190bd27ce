<p>Judges at the International Criminal Court in The Hague sentenced Sudanese militia leader Ali Muhammad Ali Abd‑Al‑Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, to 20 years in prison for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur in 2003–2004, including murder, persecution and attacks on civilians. The court had convicted him in October on 27 counts related to atrocities carried out when he was a senior commander in the Janjaweed, a government‑backed militia accused of leading a campaign of terror in western Sudan. Prosecutors had requested a life sentence, but judges said they balanced the scale of the crimes with factors such as his age and the fact that the case covered a limited time period, arriving at a single 20‑year term instead of separate sentences for each count. This is the ICC’s first sentencing decision focused solely on crimes in Darfur and is being seen as a milestone for survivors who have waited more than two decades to see one of the conflict’s key militia leaders held criminally responsible at an international court.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/RzWedcXDmcjJYe1tHwozRfnft94U0chUvzPStj2fLBd1euJPzwjEGvRwpWZwMA9F6n8030ltWeFy0oxsz1IipSq6o_XUpDeOjklLiRFp0K9HxkVwbZ8q-mgQuawQx43cECDrFGzO8Tpa3KxEKQLm85AyRD3sx3k82-PyM1JMgOXWu05DdKN6' alt='Judges at the International Criminal Court deliver the sentencing of Sudanese militia leader Ali Muhammad Ali Abd‑Al‑Rahman in The Hague.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Court’s legal reasoning: The ICC opted for one overall prison term rather than adding separate sentences for each of the 27 counts, explaining that the crimes formed part of a single course of conduct during the 2003–2004 attacks in Darfur.</li><li>Specific atrocities detailed: Judges cited evidence that Abd‑Al‑Rahman ordered and participated in attacks on villages, oversaw the detention and abuse of civilians, and personally beat prisoners, including incidents where detainees were killed with an axe inside a detention facility.</li><li>Charges and victims: The conviction covers murder, persecution, forcible transfer, rape, pillage and attacks on the civilian population in multiple localities of West Darfur, with the court recognizing that large numbers of people were killed, displaced or otherwise harmed during the charged incidents.</li><li>Sentence calculation: In determining 20 years, the judges considered the seriousness of the crimes, Abd‑Al‑Rahman’s high‑ranking role in the Janjaweed chain of command, and the fact that the charged conduct spanned roughly one year, concluding that these factors justified a substantial but not lifelong term.</li><li>Next steps legally: Both Abd‑Al‑Rahman and the prosecution have a right to appeal the sentence, and the time he has already spent in ICC custody will be deducted from the total prison term if the sentence is confirmed on appeal.</li></ul><blockquote>This sentence reflects the gravity of the crimes committed and the suffering of the victims - Judge Joanna Korner</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>International Criminal Court judges: The judges emphasized that Abd‑Al‑Rahman played a central role in orchestrating and carrying out attacks on villages in West Darfur and that a substantial prison term was necessary to reflect the extreme seriousness of the crimes and to recognize the suffering of the victims.
