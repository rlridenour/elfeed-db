In a lengthy report outlining his WWDC 2025 expectations today, Gurman revealed that the Games app will have five tabs: Home, Arcade, Play Together, Library, and Search. He said that the app will look like a games-centric version of the App Store, and it will give a bigger spotlight to both App Store games and Apple Arcade games.<br/>
<br/>
There will still be a Games tab in the App Store, according to Gurman, who described the new Games app as "underwhelming."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman previously said that the Games app will replace Apple's longstanding Game Center feature, which lets players track their in-game achievements and compete with others on leaderboards. Game Center used to be a preinstalled app on iPhones, but it was relegated to the Settings app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/06/14/game-center-removed-ios-10-beta/">starting with iOS 10</a> in 2016.<br/>
