The new Apps SDK allows developers to build tools that blend naturally into chats, and initial partners include Spotify, Canva, Zillow, Expedia, Booking.com, Coursera, and Figma.<br/>
<br/>
Users can summon apps by name. For example, you can ask "Spotify, make a playlist for my party this Friday." ChatGPT can also suggest relevant apps automatically. For instance, when discussing home purchases, ChatGPT might surface Zillow to browse listings on an interactive map.<br/>
<br/>
The system uses the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a>, which gives ChatGPT access to data sources, tools, and workflows in connected apps. <br/>
<br/>
The Apps SDK is now available in preview to developers. OpenAI plans to launch a full developer directory and monetization support later this year, while additional apps from DoorDash, Instacart, Uber, and AllTrails are coming soon.<br/>
<br/>
The feature is available to Free, Go, Plus, and Pro users outside the EU.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/07/chatgpt-interacts-with-multiple-apps/">ChatGPT Now Interacts With Multiple Apps Inside Conversations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chatgpt-now-interacts-with-multiple-apps-inside-conversations.2468597/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
