<li>Your house might not have radiant heat, but your cats’ will</li>
<li>A little house with a heated pad for a floor</li>
<li>Plug it in, let them snuggle</li>

</ul><h1>Cozy Up</h1><p>Cozy season is upon us, people. Or should we say: Cozy season is upon us, people… and pets.</p>
<p>That’s right. Your chief concerns for the upcoming period of low temperatures and long nights might be the humans in your house. Namely, you might be calculating whether there is such a thing as too much soup, and how many days in a row you can wear the same sweatpants before things get weird, and if the stress you feel nestled under a blanket watching the judging of a baking show provides enough of a heart rate spike to be counted as exercise.</p>
<p>But don’t forget about your cats.</p>
<p>Seriously, where are <em>they</em> supposed to get cozy all winter long? You know, aside from: the bed, the couch, the recliner, the sunbeam that makes its way across the kitchen floor, the basket of clean laundry that’s still warm out of the dryer, the sweater you took off and set on a chair after work, the heat vents, and all the various cat beds you already have for them.</p>
<p>Other than those meager options, where will they find any comfort during the harsher seasons?</p>
<p>In this heated cat house, that’s where.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s a little house with a heated pad for a floor. You plug it in, it radiates some warmth, your cats get in and snuggle, comfort is achieved.</p>
<p>Although, if you wanted to make them even more comfortable, you could install a tiny television in there. And make sure it’s playing nothing but cat movies. You know, great films like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>No Country For Scottish Fold Men</em></li>
<li><em>Downton Tabby: The Grand Finale</em></li>
<li><em>A Hiss-tory of Violence</em></li>
<li><em>Dodge(hair)ball</em></li>
<li><em>The Horse Whiskerer</em></li>
<li><em>A Purrfect Murder</em></li>
<li><em>The Cornish Rexorcist</em></li>
<li><em>Valley of the Ragdolls</em></li>
<li><em>Chartreux Lies</em></li>
<li><em>Blue Persian Valentine</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, they’re bad. But you know what? So are your cats, probably. And you should still get them this stupid little house. Because you love them.</p>
