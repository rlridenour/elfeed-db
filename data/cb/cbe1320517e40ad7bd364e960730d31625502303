<p>Frank Lloyd Wright homes (with the exception of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollyhock_House" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brick mausoleums he built in Los Angeles</a>) really connect with me. That’s why I was fascinated by <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2025/03/20/final-usonian-home-riverrock-frank-lloyd-wright-ohio-completed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a> about <em>RiverRock</em>, a newly completed home based on one of Wright’s 1959 <a href="https://franklloydwright.org/frank-lloyd-wrights-usonian-houses-democratic-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Usonian designs</a>. This isn’t a renovation or a loose interpretation; it is a ground-up build, decades after Wright’s death, using an original plan.</p>



<p>There’s been some controversy about the project because it was built using modern construction techniques, and allowances were made to comply with current building codes. But to me, that’s equally interesting. How do you build a Frank Lloyd Wright design in an era where building codes prevent 6-foot ceilings and people want working Internet in their homes?</p>



<p>If I were flush with cash, I would’ve done the exact same thing the homeowners did here. There’s something special about seeing a fresh, fully realized home from the pencil of Frank Lloyd Wright, even in 2025.</p>
