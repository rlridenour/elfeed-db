Australia's new social media law goes into effect on December 10, 2025, and ahead of that date, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=y1bckxf8">is sharing information</a> on developer tools that are designed to help social media apps adhere to the law.<br/>

Children under the age of 16 will no longer be allowed to use Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube (except for YouTube Kids), Snapchat, X, Twitch, Threads, and Kick in Australia, and those apps have to take "reasonable steps" to remove underage users from their platforms starting Wednesday. Apps will also need to prevent new signups from users under the age of 16, and there is a one-year transition period before penalties will begin.<br/>
<br/>
To assist developers, Apple provides the Declared Age Range API, which gives developers access to the age range of users. Other tools available include an option for an age suitability URL that provides more information on the app and its age-related content, app description pages that indicate age restrictions, and tools for setting higher minimum age ranges.<br/>
<br/>
Platforms that don't deactivate accounts created by children will face serious fines. Australia may also add more apps to its banned list over time, depending on the apps that kids adopt after not being able to access their current favorites.<br/>
<br/>
Australia is the first country to implement a total social media ban for children.<br/>
