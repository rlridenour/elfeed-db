<p>Byron swam the Hellespont. On May 3, 1810, the 22-year-old poet and a Lieutenant Ekenhead of the frigate <em>Salsette</em> swam the breaststroke from Sestos to Abydos, crossing from Europe to Asia in an hour and 10 minutes as they sought to emulate Leander&#8217;s nightly swims to Hero. &#8220;The whole distance &#8230; including the length we were carried by the current, was computed by those on board the frigate at upwards of four English miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I plume myself on this achievement more than I could possibly do on any kind of glory, political, poetical, or rhetorical,&#8221; Byron wrote. He commemorated the feat in <em>Don Juan</em>:</p>
<p>A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,<br />
He could, perhaps, have pass&#8217;d the Hellespont,<br />
As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)<br />
Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.</p>
<p>The feat is often regarded as a founding achievement in open-water swimming, and an event is held each year in its memory.</p>
