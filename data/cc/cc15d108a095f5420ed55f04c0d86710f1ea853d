<blockquote>
  <p>Even before Terry Rozier dropped out of the 2023 NBA game in which
he’s accused of rigging his statistics, computers at an “integrity
monitor” firm flagged a flood of bets that did not match a
mathematical model of how this game should go. The company, now
called IC360, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2025/01/30/nba-terry-rozier-under-investigation-illegal-gambling-scheme/78054903007/">alerted the NBA and sportsbooks about the unusual
bets coming in on Rozier’s performance</a>.</p>

<p>The investigation that led to the arrest of the Miami Heat point
guard and dozens of others for illegal gambling started with math.
It ended Oct. 23 with Rozier charged with manipulating his
performance in that 2023 game so that gamblers in the know could
win tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Beep. Boop. Busted.</p>

<p>Federal authorities allege <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2025/10/23/terry-rozier-gambling-nba-scandal-arrested-earnings/86859092007/">more than $200,000 poured in</a>
betting that Rozier would turn in a below-average performance in
that game after Rozier told another defendant he would drop out of
the game early with an injury. Rozier played 9 minutes, 34 seconds
for the Charlotte Hornets in the game against the New Orleans
Pelicans before leaving with an injury and finished under his
usual totals for points, assists and 3-pointers.</p>

<p>A lot of these stories about cheating on sports betting involve <a href="https://onefoottsunami.com/2023/07/18/bert-was-a-piece-of-work/">characters who aren’t exactly the sharpest tools in the shed</a>. Makes me wonder how many inside-info cheaters are getting away with it, because they’re not doing anything conspicuous like placing very large wagers on very obscure games or prop bets.</p>
