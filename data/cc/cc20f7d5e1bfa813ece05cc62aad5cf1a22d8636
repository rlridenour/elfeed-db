<p>I launched my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bledleysworld">YouTube channel</a> a little while ago, starting initially with just some time-lapse videos of my digital process. I was trying to just get in the habit of recording, editing, adding some audio and posting online. My first attempt with some kind of vocal commentary was a bit let down by poor audio quality but I think I&rsquo;ve been levelling them up a little each time. I recently got a better quality mic and the last couple seem like something I can share.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/f5pQRD5O4B0">Part One</a> of this series I show my process in <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a> for taking a traditional sketch from your sketchbook, scanning it in and doing digital inks and flats on top.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/2pVRKmWywNw">Part Two</a> discusses blocking in a tonal monochrome under painting and hard and soft edges.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Krita mostly because this is the easiest way for me to make videos right now. I wouldn&rsquo;t say they are totally digital tool specific.. the things discussed are more general art theory that you could apply to other mediums. As for direction of the channel - I&rsquo;m just learning as I go and do like that are many possibilities for the type of content I could make there. I&rsquo;m enjoying the editing process and the medium - YouTube is one of the better and more creative social networks at the moment in my opinion.</p>
