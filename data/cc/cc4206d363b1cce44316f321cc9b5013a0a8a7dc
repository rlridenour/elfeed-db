Shipments of iPhones fell to 9.8 million units, giving Apple a market share of 13.7 percent, down from 17.4 percent in the previous quarter. Apple has now had seven straight quarters of decline.<br/>
<br/>
For local vendors, it was another story. Market leader Xiaomi saw shipments rise 40 percent to 13.3 million units. Meanwhile, industry-wide shipments rose by 3.3 percent.<br/>
<br/>
According to IDC, Apple's premium pricing structure prevented the company from capitalizing on new government subsidies introduced at the start of the year that fuelled growth in the first quarter.<br/>

Under the subsidies, consumers of electronics get a 15 percent refund of products that are priced under 6,000 yuan (&#36;820). Apple's standard iPhone 16 starts at 5,999 yuan.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/idc/">IDC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/18/iphone-shipments-down-in-china-q1/">iPhone Shipments Down 9% in China&#039;s Q1 Smartphone Boom</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-shipments-down-9-in-chinas-q1-smartphone-boom.2455568/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
