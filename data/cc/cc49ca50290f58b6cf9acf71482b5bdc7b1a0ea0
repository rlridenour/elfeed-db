In iOS 18, Apple introduced Tinted app icons. The option applies a color filter over app icons, widgets, and even system UI elements. And with iOS 26, Apple has built on the theme with a new option that matches the color of your iPhone's removable case.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting from the off that the color-matching feature only works with official Apple MagSafe cases that include a small NFC chip with color variant information. If you don't have such a case, you might want to consider trying another new tint option in iOS 26 that can match the color of your app icons <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-tint-apps-match-iphone-color/">with the actual color of your iPhone</a>.<br/>

<h2>How to Tint App Icons to Match iPhone Case Color</h2><br/>
This filter uses a base color taken from your iPhone's case color, then automatically adjusts brightness, saturation, and contrast so icons remain legible while still reflecting the case's tone. The following steps show you how it's done.<br/>
<ol><li>On your iPhone's Home screen, long press a space between app icons.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Edit</strong> in the top-left corner, then select <strong>Customize</strong> from the popup menu.</li><br/>
<li>Choose <strong>Tinted</strong> from the options panel that appears, then tap the iPhone case button, second-to-left, under the two horizontal color sliders.</li><br/>
<li>Select <strong>Light</strong>, <strong>Dark</strong>, or <strong>Auto</strong> below that, based on your preferences.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/ios-26-tint-app-icons-iphone-case-color.jpg" alt="home screen" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020277" /><br/>

Note that Tinted mode looks different in iOS 26 than it did in iOS 18. Rather than icons featuring a black background with colored graphics, icons adopt the full color that you select with white graphics in Light Mode. In ‌Dark Mode‌, backgrounds are a much darker shade of the color you choose, but aren't entirely black.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-tint-app-icons-match-case-color/">iOS 26: Tint App Icons to Precisely Match Your iPhone Case Color</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-tint-app-icons-to-precisely-match-your-iphone-case-color.2467351/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
