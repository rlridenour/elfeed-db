Ankit Gadiya has a <a href="https://ankit.earth/blog/my-emacs-presentation-stack/">very nice post</a> that explains and demonstrates how he uses Org for presentations. It&rsquo;s a nice workflow that uses Org, <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/logos">Logos</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti">Olivetti</a>, and <a href="https://pikchr.org/home/doc/trunk/homepage.md">Pikchr</a> to create and display his presentation.
</p>
<p>
Gadiya starts his presentations with an outline. That&rsquo;s a natural thing to do in Org mode, of course, and he has things configured so that each header and subheader is the title of a slide. That makes it easy to move things around an restructure the presentation.

<p>
He uses Pikchr, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_(markup_language)">Pic</a>-like language for line diagrams. I didn&rsquo;t know about it and have never used it but I have used Pic a lot and really like it. I&rsquo;ll definitely be checking out Pikchr since I don&rsquo;t use the Troff suite much any longer.

<p>
A nice thing about Gadiya&rsquo;s post is that he shows his complete configuration so it&rsquo;s easy to replicate or adapt it. I like this approach much better than the fancier packages like Apple&rsquo;s Keynote that I always find difficult to use because they offer so many features.

If you regularly—or even occasionally—find yourself giving presentations, take a look at Gadiya&rsquo;s post. If you&rsquo;re an Org user, you&rsquo;ll find the workflow familiar and easy. He has a lot of good ideas and they&rsquo;re all documented well in his post.</p>
