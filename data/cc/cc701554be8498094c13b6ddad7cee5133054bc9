  

<p>I’ve used ⌘-hover on my Mac to preview internal links in Obsidian for years, but this week I discovered that it also works on tabs. Quite by accident I held down <code>⌘</code> while hovering over the name of a tab, and a 3rd-party-plugin-free, scrollable preview of that page appeared — with clickable links (!).</p>
<p>I turned off the Hover Editor plugin back in the day because I found its behaviour inconsistent and annoying. And anyway, I prefer plugin-free solutions wherever feasible.</p>
<p>So far I’ve used ⌘-hover over tabs to quickly view the today page, while looking at my tasks for this week.</p>

<p>Pressing ⌘ (⌃ in Windows) while hovering over tabs does what I want and nothing more: it makes the target page appear as a functional window on top of the current page, and disappear when the mouse moves away from it.</p>
<p>Command/Control-hovering over tabs works well for plugin-free, basic previews of both tabs and internal links. Any links you click in this preview will replace the current page. ⌘-hovering over links in the preview popup window will overlay another preview window of that link.</p>
<p>The Hover Editor plugin allows you to see a persistent, editable, resizable window on top of the current page, but links clicked here will open another Hover Editor window, leaving the current page in place. Command/Control-clicking these links will cause them to open in the place of the current page.</p>
