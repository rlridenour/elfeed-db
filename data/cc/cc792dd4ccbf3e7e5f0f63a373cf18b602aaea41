<p>I have <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/xenodium-ltd/id304568690">three apps on the App Store</a>: <a href="https://plainorg.com">Plain Org</a>, <a href="https://flathabits.com/">Flat Habits</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scratch/id1671420139">scratch</a>.</p>
<h2>Plain Org / <a href="https://plainorg.com">plainorg.com</a></h2>
<p>My more generic solution to access org files on the go and away from Emacs.</p>

<h2>Flat Habits / <a href="https://flathabits.com/">flathabits.com</a></h2>
<p>My take on frictionless habit tracking truly respecting user privacy and their time (absolutely no distractions).</p>

<h2><code>*scratch*</code> / <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scratch/id1671420139">App Store</a></h2>
<p>Sure, we have tons of note-taking apps but most require more steps than desirable to write something down ASAP. Launch the app and you're good to write. No new note creation, bring keyboard up, etc.</p>

<h2>Common denominator</h2>
<p>In addition to being offline-first, no cloud, no login, no ads, no tracking, no social… each app targets a specific purpose, sharing an important common denominator: they all use <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org markup</a> as the underlying storage.</p>
<h2>The Org bundle / <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app-bundle/the-org-bundle/id1717663541">App Store</a></h2>
<p>While you can still get each of my apps individually, you now have the option to get them all as a single bundle: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app-bundle/the-org-bundle/id1717663541">The Org bundle</a>.</p>

<h2>Journelly joining the bundle soon…</h2>
<p>Continuing on the org storage theme, I got another app in the works. Also joining <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app-bundle/the-org-bundle/id1717663541">The Org bundle</a>, maintaining its privacy-first approach: offline, no cloud, no login, no ads, no tracking, no social… this time in the journaling space.</p>
<p>Journelly is currently <a href="https://xenodium.com/an-ios-journaling-app-powered-by-org-plain-text">in beta, want to join</a>?</p>
