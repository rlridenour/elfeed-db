<p>The end of the year isn’t far away, so every man and his dog are throwing goal setting advice at us from every angle. Most I ignore. Some that I’ve found helpful are these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stephango.com/40-questions" target="_blank">Steph Ango’s 40 questions</a></li>
<li>Carl Pullein’s <a href="https://www.carlpullein.com/downloads" target="_blank">Annual Planning template</a> (scroll down)</li>
<li><a href="https://nesslabs.com/annual-review-template" target="_blank">Anne Laure’s 15-page Annual Review template</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nesslabs.com/best" target="_blank">Anne Laure’s other articles</a>: peruse the list and click on the first headline that stands out. Anne-Laure also has a yearly group video guided planning session at the end of each year for Ness Labs members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I don’t do New Year’s resolutions. I prefer to check in every month (usually on Sundays) on how the things I’m doing are furthering my main values, or <a href="https://www.carlpullein.com/podcast/why-everything-must-start-from-your-areas-of-focus/14/9/2020" target="_blank">areas of focus</a>.</p>
<p>Remember, you can (within reason) do anything, but you can’t do everything: not today, this week, or this life. Not counting routine tasks, add one or two things to tomorrow’s to do list that will further a core area or value. Do this every day and progress will come!</p>
<p>Each evening brings the opportunity to resolve to make progress on the morrow in the things that are important to you. What might happen if you created the day in your head or on paper before the sun gets up, then slept on it? Plans don’t have to be perfect. It’s okay to start small and celebrate, if not a success, then the wonderful fact that you turned up rather than giving up.</p>
<h2 id="currently-exploring">Currently exploring</h2>
<ul>
<li>Setting up a new MacBook Pro from scratch and learning which apps, utilities and settings my fingers itch for</li>
<li>What it’s like to leave my devices out of reach for several hours each day</li>
<li>Filling in the unused spaces of past weeks in my paper planner with quotes from wisdom literature, writing at different angles to engage my brain and make the material more memorable</li>
</ul>
