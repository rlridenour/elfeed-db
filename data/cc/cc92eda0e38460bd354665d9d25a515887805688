Intro This is an issue that others are experiencing too.1
Just pulled and evalled latest bufler moments ago.
  Have multiple frames/windows running, eg C-x 2
  M-x bufler
  choose one of the buffers from the list, to move to it
  See it close one of your other windows.
I discovered this when it was eliminating my exwm workspaces upon choosing something, but I found that it is by no means limited to exwm things.
