<p>Guatemala’s government declared a 30-day nationwide state of emergency after a wave of gang-linked violence that included coordinated attacks killing at least seven police officers in and around Guatemala City. Authorities said the violence followed uprisings in three prisons, where gang-affiliated inmates took dozens of people hostage to press demands related to the custody conditions of gang leaders. Security forces reported they had retaken control of the prisons and freed captives, a key immediate step toward restoring order even as the emergency measures expand the state’s powers to respond.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qGWC0CjGgb_phlxHysMjgsYEo7lZJJ-7Wp_V9vwHsna_rM_1DidGZTR9NiYywAM_iy03PPoxb2Mvtjj2g8yRPyZgNJRbtaUCS_rYkrSTZBNLHg6a_-R05bbfMy8Q1T7UWxncahiUIQ8lqwnBLmE9XAiIRcQCd6utjDtWbXjwrGnMRNJ5Mah_f-6XO4vq3w' alt='Guatemalan riot police officers guard the entrance to the men’s Preventive Detention Center in Guatemala City on Sunday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Hostage scale: Officials said inmates seized 46 hostages across three prisons during the unrest, underscoring how quickly prison incidents can spill into wider public security crises.</li><li>Prison retaken: Riot police stormed Renovación prison in Escuintla to rescue nine guards held hostage, part of a broader operation to reassert state control over maximum-security facilities.</li><li>Schools paused: Some schools suspended classes amid the violence, reflecting how rapidly daily life can be disrupted when security conditions deteriorate.</li><li>Retaliation claim: Authorities described the police killings as retaliation after forces moved to regain control of prisons, linking street attacks to pressure tactics from behind bars.</li><li>Casualty variance: Different official counts circulated in early reporting, with several outlets citing seven slain officers and others reporting eight, as authorities continued to verify incidents across multiple attack sites.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Bernardo Arévalo and his administration: The government framed the 30-day emergency as a necessary step to combat gangs after prison riots and targeted attacks on police, while emphasizing security forces had regained control of the affected prisons.
