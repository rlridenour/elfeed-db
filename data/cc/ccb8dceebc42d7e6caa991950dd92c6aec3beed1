<p>The United States has formally completed its exit from the World Health Organization, ending its membership in the Geneva-based UN health agency about a year after President Donald Trump initiated the withdrawal process. US officials said they have terminated funding, recalled personnel working with WHO, and ended participation in WHO-led meetings and leadership efforts. Public health experts and WHO-focused observers warned the move could weaken international coordination against outbreaks and leave a funding gap at an organization the US had been a major donor to. While the decision is contentious, it also puts a spotlight on how other countries, foundations, and regional bodies might step up cooperation and financing to keep global disease surveillance and emergency response resilient.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lop_NDoy072IwuN8efgwMcbQopgThNGBdvqwD2f67GWO9r7VswmhH4Dv6d6fYQQN82pwK62kiEQiVL4Du3PTxm7mk-jYHi4kCKM8AXvLREu1Y6h180NBCgzINDa6YU7uaA6E_YyU-be8pBMmG3j3Onx5_eoWnxu9gSccEnvR0iqJNQoK3LgHzy92fUUQTCanKjT4s1tgfwUsRivluyGZvE4GpQjjC1c-RTuDVHKaYIn4i_N7S-UhQS_Qh1yx1xAfuI3g2g' alt='A view related to WHO and global health coverage (file photo).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Unpaid dues: Several outlets reported the US is departing with substantial outstanding obligations, cited as roughly $260 million by some sources and about $333 million by another.</li><li>First to leave: Reuters reported the US becomes the first member state to withdraw from the WHO, underscoring how unusual a full exit is for the agency’s membership model.</li><li>Legal expert warning: Georgetown University public health law expert Lawrence Gostin said the withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks, reflecting concerns about diminished coordination and shared preparedness.</li><li>Operational pullback: The US Department of Health and Human Services said it recalled US personnel from WHO offices and headquarters and ended participation in WHO-sponsored leadership activities.</li><li>Budget pressure: The Straits Times said the withdrawal notice left WHO without its top donor, raising questions about how quickly the agency can backfill resources for programs and emergency work.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US government (HHS/State Department): Officials said the US completed its WHO withdrawal process and ended funding and participation tied to the agency.
