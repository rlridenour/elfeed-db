<p>US negotiators sent by President Donald Trump held late-night talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as diplomacy intensifies ahead of planned follow-up meetings in Abu Dhabi. The Kremlin said the path to any settlement still depends on resolving the territorial question, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a draft agreement was “nearly ready” and has emphasized post-war security guarantees. Officials described the Moscow discussions as “useful,” and sources reported that Russia, Ukraine and the US would convene their first trilateral working-group talks on security in the UAE, offering a clearer channel for direct contact among the three parties.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/a0REZ0Uk2La6uim_mhKn2yLekDz_KmP79iEWUVuQhzyWxpoILAgdn_uOT5GJbRfNV-Cz8CQqB4P6Cw18GzJB2heectwJWzVKG7vr2zSAG9zYPCzMe3KprvQzTyuqNE1UEWj8YxCZqTJvWI91Mng1HfYuZJVWgZWXfx67jPkRjB-6lNI7n8kL-g_6E0Nzj5xUmiBbOT_Rd5fSkla__Jmvf5DEpf239ZohR74eMISoCeBiwK9mQ66eiU7lCB8Rd_qxWfcjGAOfvHoGED4w4A' alt='Russian President Vladimir Putin greets U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner at the Kremlin, Jan. 22, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>US team makeup: The Kremlin said envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin alongside Jared Kushner and U.S. official Josh Gruenbaum, described as an adviser linked to a Trump “Board of Peace” initiative.</li><li>Talks duration: Reports described the Kremlin session running for hours into the night, with some accounts saying it lasted past 3 a.m. and others putting it at nearly four hours.</li><li>Next venue: Multiple outlets reported delegations would head to Abu Dhabi for a first three-way meeting and additional security-focused discussions involving US, Russian and Ukrainian teams.</li><li>Parallel track: A separate Witkoff–Kirill Dmitriev meeting in Abu Dhabi was also planned to discuss Russia–US trade, according to a Kremlin aide cited by RT.</li><li>Europe criticism: Zelensky criticized European allies for what he called a slow and fragmented response to the invasion, raising questions about how Europe will shape security guarantees and reconstruction support.</li></ul><blockquote>We remain interested in resolving the Ukrainian crisis by political and diplomatic means. - Yury Ushakov</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Kremlin: Russian officials said any peace deal requires settling the territorial issue, and they characterized the Moscow talks as constructive and candid.
