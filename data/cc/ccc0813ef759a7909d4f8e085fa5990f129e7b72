<p>Nearly two years back I wrote a utility called <a href="http://yummymelon.com/captee/">Captee</a> that uses the native macOS Share Menu ( <img src='http://yummymelon.com/devnull/images/looking-for-scrim-beta-testers/share-icon_resize_x64.png' width='14pt' style='margin-bottom: -3pt;' /> ) to share a link or text clipping in either Markdown or <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org</a> format. The idea was that any macOS app that supported the Share Menu could take advantage of this. Among the features that Captee supported was the ability to share content via <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Protocols.html">Org Protocol</a>, a custom URL scheme devised to import content into Emacs.</p>
<p>However, for Org Protocol to work, it required that there be a way to transport the <code>org-protocol://</code> URL request to Emacs on macOS. Org Protocol’s original implementation presumed that <code>emacsclient</code> would do the lifting here, where the sharing app would be able to call <code>emacsclient</code> with the <code>org-protocol//</code> request as its argument. This was however a regrettable design decision made over a decade ago as recent versions of macOS now have a default sandbox policy that prevents an app from calling an executable like <code>emacsclient</code> outside of its sandbox.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/src/master/">Mitsuharu Yamamoto fork of Emacs</a> got around this restriction by supporting the Org Protocol custom URL scheme natively, where it would directly accept the URL request, bypassing <code>emacsclient</code>. Unfortunately for users of GNU FSF-published Emacs, Org Protocol was viable only if <code>emacsclient</code> was enabled, typically by relaxing macOS security permissions.</p>
<p>To address the above for GNU FSF-published Emacs, I set out to build a proxy utility that would accept the <code>org-protocol://</code> URL request and transport it to Emacs in a way that conforms to macOS security policies. In effect, I made a macOS client app for Emacs server.</p>
<p>This app is named <strong>Scrim</strong> and is now in BETA test. I’m looking for testers, especially for those of you who already have Captee. If you’re interested and <em>willing</em> to provide feedback, <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/Ssm1P3Su">please add yourself to the Beta test group on TestFlight</a>, an Apple tool for distributing code-signed apps. At current I’m most interested in the following feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sanity check - Does the app work as advertised?</li>
<li>Were the instructions to setup Emacs server easy to follow? If not, then what was missing?</li>
<li>Are you a user of Captee?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do sign yourself up for this, please provide answers to the above via the mail feedback in the <strong>Scrim</strong> app.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
