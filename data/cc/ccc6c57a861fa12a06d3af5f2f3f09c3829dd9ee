Electric automaker Rivian is preparing to launch a dedicated Apple Watch app that will allow owners to access and control their vehicles directly from their wrist.<br/>

Rivian is planning to release a companion Apple Watch app as part of its upcoming 2026.03 software update, according to release notes posted by <em><a href="https://riviantrackr.com/2026-03/">RivianTrackr</a></em>. The update is tied to version 3.9 of the Rivian mobile app, which has not yet been released on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The release notes say that the update will allow owners to remotely access and control their vehicles from the Apple Watch, including locking and unlocking doors, venting windows, and sounding the alarm. Users can use the Digital Crown to set a target state of charge or adjust the cabin temperature. The app's customizable design allows users to choose up to four quick controls for instant access to their most-used features.<br/>
<br/>
The addition of the Apple Watch app effectively extends wrist-based vehicle access to older Rivian vehicles that cannot use Apple's built-in Wallet-based digital key independently. Rivian began supporting Apple Wallet-based digital Car Keys <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/08/rivian-apple-wallet-car-keys-later-this-month/">in December</a>, allowing owners of newer vehicles to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or Apple Watch to unlock and start their vehicles without a physical key, but support is limited to second-generation Rivian models beginning with the 2025 model year.<br/>
<br/>
Rivian's first-generation vehicles, produced from 2021 to 2024, will gain Apple Watch digital key functionality through the new app for the first time. The app will need to be open for functionality to work on these older vehicles. For those newer vehicles, the digital key can function without requiring the Apple Watch app to be launched via a Car Key in the wallet. <br/>
