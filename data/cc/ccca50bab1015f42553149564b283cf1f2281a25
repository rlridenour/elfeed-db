<p>Early Friday, Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile assault that struck Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, killing six people in an apartment block in Kyiv and at least two more elsewhere while injuring dozens and damaging residential buildings and public infrastructure. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted many incoming weapons, but falling debris and fires damaged high-rise apartments, a school, a medical facility and administrative buildings across multiple districts. The strikes are part of a pattern of attacks on energy infrastructure as winter approaches, raising concerns about power outages and civilian hardship.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/BOl_UfZRwN_i-mi4KAgZF6gWn144U1jnobQ-oFDZ61LdayOwX063ro_U4T4Clwofgbjq7iCtHtjmXLjr8SKOjP2Ejc-5fpPEEUIaRDWa7p0D' alt='Flames and smoke over Kyiv after overnight drone and missile strikes damaged buildings across multiple districts' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Attack scale: Ukrainian and media reports said the assault involved hundreds of unmanned aerial vehicles and missiles — roughly 430 drones and 18 missiles — according to Ukrainian officials cited in reporting.</li><li>Energy targeting: Journalists and officials note strikes have increasingly aimed at power and energy infrastructure to cause outages ahead of winter, part of a sustained campaign against the grid.</li><li>Retaliatory strikes: Ukraine said it struck Russia’s Black Sea port of Novorossiysk in response, damaging a refinery; Russia then halted oil exports from that port, which pushed international oil prices up about $2 per barrel in coverage.</li><li>Diplomatic fallout: A missile also struck the Azerbaijani embassy building in Kyiv, damaging its walls and prompting Baku to lodge a formal protest with Moscow, according to reporting.</li><li>Frontline fighting: Separately, fighting intensified around the frontline city of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine as ground combat continued amid the aerial campaign.</li></ul><blockquote>Only pressure with sanctions and strength can force Russia to end this war, a war that no one but them ever needed - Volodymyr Zelenskyy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Russian defence ministry: Moscow said its forces struck Ukrainian energy facilities and weapons-production sites in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russia, describing the strikes as targeting infrastructure used in the conflict.
