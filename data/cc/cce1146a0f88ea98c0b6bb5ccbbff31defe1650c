<p>Two West Virginia National Guard soldiers were shot and critically wounded in an ambush-style attack on a downtown Washington, DC street just a few blocks from the White House on Wednesday afternoon, prompting a brief lockdown of parts of the area while President Trump was in Florida. Police and FBI officials say a man walked around a corner near the Farragut West Metro entrance and opened fire at close range on the patrolling guardsmen, and that the incident is being investigated as a targeted attack and possible act of terrorism. The suspect, identified as 29‑year‑old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was shot, arrested at the scene, and later described by officials and media as having entered the US under the Biden‑era Operation Allies Welcome evacuation in 2021 before receiving asylum in April 2025. President Trump called the shooting an &quot;act of terror,&quot; ordered an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington on top of thousands already deployed, and the US government subsequently paused processing all immigration requests from Afghan nationals pending a review of vetting procedures.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/_-9lqfVSZ9-_clpZ87qGFy2xeNTmwDatovcqEaF35M66Lhv9plzCyCKj9nu38PWRRG0LDJZdF8Poy9kQWrhbGoD_3TrMeP81XGxFyntk6J13HoZHrbrrpIfeP9HIiOC5lDjSofL-uUgVLxdMJL5I2nbI6yfyurg4cVCLTdtsauAV_UutGUmnigJBYR1FokgiOTbp0-78mjzaWVwg-lRENzrwH1bym4Hldd7yjC7COYNW3CjbdJ01bPjW-oCdpNnPFRwKRmkV38rq1fQmMw' alt='National Guard personnel secure a downtown Washington, DC street after two soldiers were shot near the White House.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Attack details: Metropolitan Police assistant chief Jeffrey Carroll said the gunman &quot;came around the corner, raised his arm with a firearm and discharged&quot; multiple rounds at the soldiers, firing an estimated 10 to 15 shots before being wounded himself.</li><li>Victims identified: Officials said the wounded troops are members of the West Virginia National Guard deployed to Washington, with the state’s governor initially and incorrectly reporting they had died before later clarifying that their condition remained critical.</li><li>Shooter’s background: Reports describe Lakanwal as having arrived in the US with his family on 8 September 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome and later spending about a decade working alongside US Special Forces in Afghanistan before resettlement.</li><li>Immigration policy response: Following Trump’s demand to &quot;re‑examine&quot; Afghans who entered under Biden, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it had indefinitely halted all immigration requests from Afghan nationals while security vetting is reviewed.</li><li>Political and community reactions: While Trump and Homeland Security officials linked the attack to Biden‑era admissions and vowed tougher deportations, other voices, including former president Barack Obama and Jewish leaders in Israel, emphasized condolences, condemned violence, and expressed concern for Afghan refugees who had assisted US forces.</li></ul><blockquote>It was a crime against our entire nation. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: President Trump labeled the assault an &quot;act of terror,&quot; said the suspect &quot;was flown in&quot; from Afghanistan under Joe Biden’s Operation Allies Welcome, and called for re‑examining every Afghan who entered the US under that program while expanding deportations.
