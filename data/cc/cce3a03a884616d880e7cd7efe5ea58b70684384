  <p>After Substack shocked an unknown number of users by sending a
push notification on Monday to check out a Nazi blog featuring a
swastika icon, the company quickly apologized for the “error,”
<a href="https://www.usermag.co/p/substack-sent-a-push-alert-promoting-nazi-white-supremacist-blog">tech columnist Taylor Lorenz reported</a>. [...]</p>

<p>Substack has long faced backlash for allowing users to share their
“extreme views” on the platform, previously claiming that
“censorship (including through demonetizing publications)” doesn’t
make “the problem go away — in fact, it makes it worse,” Lorenz
noted. But critics who have slammed Substack’s rationale revived
their concerns this week, with some accusing Substack of promoting
extreme content through features like their push alerts and
“rising” lists, which flag popular newsletters and currently also
include Nazi blogs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The publication in question, NatSocToday, <a href="https://substack.com/@natsoctoday1">describes itself</a>
as a “National Socialist weekly newsletter featuring opinions and
news important to the National Socialist and White Nationalist
Community.” The newsletter’s image header is a Nazi flag, and its
latest post, as of Wednesday, was <a href="https://substack.com/@natsoctoday1/p-169055191">an article</a> that includes
the sentence: “We demand the return of all territory currently
occupied by jews and non-Whites in historically White homelands.”
It does not appear to be a particularly popular blog, and
currently has fewer than a thousand subscribers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A mantra  of “<em>we host all views, but don’t promote or endorse all views</em>” doesn’t hold much water when you promote a blog whose logo is a straight-up Nazi swastika.</p>
