Hooray. Journelly, which I think of as an iOS  front end for Emacs&rsquo; Org mode, has been <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only">officially released</a>. For those of you who have been waiting for an official release to try it out, your time has come.

I&rsquo;ve been using this app everyday for the last month and even though I was working with a beta, it has been rock solid. I really, <i>really</i> like this app and recommend that everyone try it out. It&rsquo;s $14.99 but let me assure you that it&rsquo;s worth every penny.

One of the things that I haven&rsquo;t mentioned in my posts about it is that there&rsquo;s seamless syncing of your data. No third party apps or difficult configuration. You simply specify that you want to sync your data to iCloud and it&rsquo;s instantly available to Org mode on your Mac and the rest of your iOS devices. Exactly what we expect, but seldom get from apps that interface between iOS and Emacs. Ramírez says that exporting to Markdown is on his todo list so even if you aren&rsquo;t—for some reason—an Org mode user, he&rsquo;s got you covered.

This is the first app that I&rsquo;ve bought for a long time but I&rsquo;m happy to spend the money. Journelly has become an important part of my workflow.</p>
