Here&rsquo;s a bit of a palate cleaner to ease you into Monday. Back in 2002, Anders Jensen-Urstad wrote to several prominent hackers and asked them for a screenshot of their desktop. You can see <a href="https://anders.unix.se/2015/10/28/screenshots-from-developers--unix-people-2002/">most of them here</a> from when he republished them after 13 years.
</p>
<p>
His republishing of the screenshots generated a lot of interest so he wrote to the same people asking them for another screenshot. Not everyone answered but some did and Jensen-Urstad published <a href="https://anders.unix.se/2015/12/10/screenshots-from-developers--2002-vs.-2015/">side-by-side screenshots</a> showing then and now<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> versions.
</p>
<p>
None of this matter at all, of course, but I enjoy seeing other people&rsquo;s desktops and perhaps you will too. One interesting thing was that many of the respondents described their desktops as boring because they consisted mostly of Xterms. Mine used to be like that too until I took up permanent residence in Emacs.
