<p>Japan and China have entered a sharp diplomatic dispute after Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested an attack on Taiwan would be an &quot;existential threat&quot; to regional security, remarks that Beijing called damaging to bilateral ties. Beijing responded with strong rhetoric, formal protest and measures that included urging citizens to avoid travel to Japan and suspending some cultural exchanges, and Chinese travellers reportedly cancelled hundreds of thousands of Japan-bound tickets. In reaction, Japan&#x27;s embassy in Beijing repeated a safety notice for Japanese citizens in China asking them to remain vigilant and take precautions, and Tokyo dispatched a senior official to Beijing in a bid to defuse the dispute. The row has produced immediate economic effects on airlines, tourism-related firms and cultural events while prompting business leaders in Japan to call for a diplomatic resolution.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7wvsraejqdPZunratWSHD4EUD6jSFkoxLfvth86Rn0cg4ntNbzbDArLG5BNsD86rDjw1n71ayD0F5J2Hu0GuReLmIIBm21K7mDMTb9ZrcYa0RK7VksgCr7UyPQPv52Xd' alt='Photo illustration of Xi Jinping, Sanae Takaichi and a map of the East China Sea including Taiwan' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Economic shocks: Japan&#x27;s tourism and retail shares fell as airlines and cultural organisers scrambled to offer refunds and manage cancellations after Beijing&#x27;s advisory</li><li>Formal protest: China lodged a diplomatic protest during talks with Japanese officials, signalling Beijing&#x27;s use of formal state channels to register its anger</li><li>Cultural impact: Several film screenings and cultural exchanges involving Japan were postponed or suspended amid the dispute, disrupting entertainment and soft-power activities</li><li>Policy shift: Analysts say Takaichi’s unusually explicit wording on Taiwan marks a clearer Japanese posture compared with previous government vagueness on Taiwan commitments</li></ul><blockquote>The dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off - Xue Jian</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Japanese government (Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi): Takaichi framed an attack on Taiwan as an existential regional threat and suggested Japan might respond, arguing the comments reflect security realities near Japanese territory.
