<blockquote><p>
A Man with a Shotgun said to a Bird:</p>
<p>&#8216;It is all nonsense, you know, about shooting being a cruel sport. I put my skill against your cunning &#8212; that is all there is of it. It is a fair game.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;True,&#8217; said the Bird, &#8216;but I don&#8217;t wish to play.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Why not?&#8217; inquired the Man with a Shotgun.</p>
<p>&#8216;The game,&#8217; the Bird replied, &#8216;is fair as you say; the chances are about even; but consider the stake. I am in it for you, but what is there in it for me?&#8217;</p>
<p>Not being prepared with an answer to the question, the Man with a Shotgun sagaciously removed the propounder.
