Apple is increasing production on the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> due to unexpected demand for the device, reports <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-rushes-boost-production-cheaper-iphone-17">The Information</a></em>. Following a strong pre-order weekend, Apple told two suppliers to increase daily &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; output by at least 30 percent.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;799, and it is &#36;200 cheaper than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>. It's &#36;300 less than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, which now starts at &#36;1,099. This year, the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; got "Pro" features with the addition of a 120Hz refresh rate and Always-On display technology, plus it is the same size as the 17 Pro at 6.3 inches.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>The Information</em>, Apple's decision to increase &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; production suggests that the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models are not selling as well as usual this year. If that's the case, it could have consequences for Apple's gross margin and September quarter revenue.<br/>
<br/>
Ahead of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; launch, Apple allocated 25 percent of its &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; production to the standard model, 10 percent to the Air, and 65 percent to the Pro and Pro Max, as those are typically Apple's best-selling devices.<br/>
<br/>
The standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the two Pro models have been staples in Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; line, but the company has struggled to find a fourth model that draws consumer interest. It started with the "mini" iPhones that were smaller than the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. Those didn't sell as well as expected, so Apple moved on to the "Plus" size, offering standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; features paired with a larger display. The Plus &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales were also disappointing, so Apple has now moved to the ultra thin Air, and the company is hoping that a fresh design will lure customers into upgrading.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; is not yet available in China because of regulatory issues with the eSIM-only design. As a result, more Chinese customers may be opting for the standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;.<br/>

Apple updates its device forecasts on a weekly basis, so the mix of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models that suppliers are asked to prioritize could shift.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-17">iPhone 17 (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/19/apple-increases-iphone-17-production/">Standard iPhone 17 Outperforms Expectations as Apple Ramps Up Manufacturing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/standard-iphone-17-outperforms-expectations-as-apple-ramps-up-manufacturing.2466634/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
