<p>Argentina’s President Javier Milei scored a strong victory in midterm legislative elections as his La Libertad Avanza (LLA) party won roughly 40.8% of the nationwide vote, a result that strengthens his ability to block congressional overrides of his vetoes and advance free‑market reforms . The vote was closely watched abroad after Argentina experienced weeks of financial market turmoil and the United States finalized up to a $40 billion support package to stabilise the economy ahead of the polls . Milei hailed the outcome as a turning point for Argentina while allies in Washington publicly congratulated him, underlining the election’s geopolitical as well as domestic economic significance .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uD1nDyj_eSX4AXAs9aqvuQZ9CGriDFP4wtwDywzgvQXqyUCih_61Gvl67WrxIGGcLb0uurBnfMyzI7duLMrTdVbwWUe3o8r5Gv9yn2SqmZMh6Qvhs48qkXwxNTDtM1jSFGp5l5XcpUOFdxG6gcUEmb4LmK22Z_q37a73rjfdwXPih223QeLrpOzhg9KtX-FtS2DrjD-pEleXdIVa3SQGNgyWVEOPYRU083WdV4YtVFi70_bxrn77iYbk74Vjx6G6sVOD10eDyC6lPA55MQ' alt='Argentina&#x27;s President Javier Milei waves to supporters after voting during legislative midterm elections in Buenos Aires, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Seat gains: Milei&#x27;s party more than tripled its lower‑house representation, increasing from 37 to about 101 deputies according to media tallies reporting official counts .</li><li>Market context: The election followed weeks of financial turbulence that prompted emergency measures and international intervention to steady Argentina’s markets before voting .</li><li>Regional strength: LLA secured unexpectedly strong results in key provinces including Córdoba, Mendoza, Santa Fe and Entre Ríos, helping build its nationwide plurality .</li><li>U.S. involvement: Washington’s support — described by U.S. officials as up to a $40 billion package of swaps and purchases — was framed publicly as backing for Argentina’s reform agenda ahead of the vote .</li></ul><blockquote>Today we reached a turning point, today begins the construction of a great Argentina - Javier Milei</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Javier Milei: He called the result a &#x27;turning point&#x27; that allows him to press ahead with a radical programme of shrinking the state and deregulating the economy .
