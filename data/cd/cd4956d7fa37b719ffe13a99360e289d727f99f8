<p>Israeli forces shot and killed two Palestinian men during a raid in the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, minutes after the pair had emerged from a surrounded building and appeared to surrender with their hands raised and shirts lifted to show they were unarmed, according to multiple videos and eyewitnesses published by international media and Palestinian TV. The Palestinian Authority identified the dead as 37‑year‑old Yussef Ali Asa&#x27;sa and 26‑year‑old Al‑Muntasir Billah Mahmud Abdullah, and accused Israel of carrying out an execution and a &quot;war crime&quot;. The Israeli military and police said they have opened a joint review into the incident, which followed what officials described as a prolonged &quot;surrender procedure&quot; during an operation to arrest wanted suspects in an area they describe as a hub for armed groups. The footage, which appears to show troops directing the men back inside the building before firing at close range, has sparked widespread outrage, sharpened Palestinian accusations of impunity, and added to international criticism of Israel’s conduct in the West Bank.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/2-Mbw4-abOw_jl2-MCj3njR7Dgghr9BVxgI1iVIGGuFUEiuSyZ4ewZTHge2AiMz4dHvAjDLtZWS_KNEZxUJUK0s15aavaaQ8NmW3HCx-KNtEI1-OftBVE2SDPe-X-lG-5QxsrznwY5OoypL5OMVcjf1HMi78O5qlQBLOBMymb0wzbvKuScZERgRJFBA0f3bgRuc3p9C3JgEB6rFRw6g5NrLTeoB39T3wCwchjoY7N-uQDD-cPw1YffU0oixuR5TB16Y5KmY8tfGuor9NxA' alt='Residents inspect the site of the Jenin raid where two Palestinians were killed after appearing to surrender to Israeli forces.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Incident sequence: Video from at least three angles shows the two men leave the building, lift their shirts, lie on the ground, then be told by Israeli forces to re‑enter the structure before gunfire is heard and their bodies are later seen motionless near the entrance.</li><li>Israeli justification: Israeli officials said forces had been operating against what they called a &quot;terrorist cell&quot; in Jenin, claimed the men were suspected of past attacks, and argued that combat in such dense urban areas involves split‑second decisions under perceived threat, while still pledging an investigation into whether rules were followed.</li><li>Palestinian response: Palestinian officials in Jenin and Ramallah described the killings as a &quot;cold‑blooded execution,&quot; said the men were unarmed and had clearly surrendered, and demanded international accountability mechanisms rather than internal Israeli probes, which they argue rarely lead to prosecutions.</li><li>Domestic Israeli debate: While Israel’s military and police leadership promised a professional review, at least one Israeli minister publicly backed the soldiers’ actions in Jenin, highlighting internal divisions in Israel over how rigorously to investigate and potentially punish troops for conduct in West Bank operations.</li><li>Broader West Bank context: The raid came amid an intensified Israeli campaign in the West Bank over the past two years, including repeated incursions into Jenin refugee camp and rising settler–Palestinian violence, which European governments have jointly condemned in separate statements this week.</li></ul><blockquote>This looks like an execution of people who were trying to surrender and did not appear to pose any immediate threat - Omar Shakir</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli military and police: The army and national police announced a joint review into the raid, saying forces had opened fire on suspects who exited the building during a prolonged surrender process and that commanders would examine whether the soldiers acted in accordance with open‑fire regulations.
