<p id="p2">On December 15, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-fitness-plus-expands-to-28-new-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple is expanding</a> <a href="https://fitness.apple.com/us/subscribe?at=1001l3bhP&amp;ct=ms_article" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fitness+</a> to 28 new markets, including Chile, Hong Kong, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, and Taiwan, which will more than double the number of places with access to the service. The company is also dubbing fitness classes into Spanish, German, and Japanese, with the first two languages coming December 15, and Japanese dubbing coming early next year. K-Pop is being added as a new music genre to the service, too.</p>

It may have been the case that the service was under review, but with the expansion into 49 total countries and the addition of new features, it appears that Apple has concluded Fitness is worth keeping as <a href="https://fitness.apple.com/us/subscribe?at=1001l3bhP&amp;ct=ms_article" rel="noopener noreferrer">a standalone subscription</a>.</p>
