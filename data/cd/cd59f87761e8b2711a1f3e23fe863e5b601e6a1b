With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a>, Apple added a bunch of new options for the Background Sounds feature. If you're unfamiliar with it, it is an Accessibility option that allows your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to play soothing background noise, like white noise or rain.<br/>

Prior to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, there were eight Background Sounds options, but now there are a total of sixteen. Here's what's new:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Babble</li><br/>
 	<li>Steam</li><br/>
 	<li>Airplane</li><br/>
 	<li>Boat</li><br/>
 	<li>Bus</li><br/>
 	<li>Train</li><br/>
 	<li>Rain on Roof</li><br/>
 	<li>Quiet Night</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
These join the original eight, which include Balanced Noise, Bright Noise, Dark Noise, Ocean, Rain, Stream, Night, and Fire.<br/>
<br/>
Background Sounds can be toggled on in the Settings app under Accessibility &gt; Audio and Visual &gt; Background Sounds. Once you've opted in and selected a sound, you can toggle Background Sounds on and off through the Hearing Accessibility shortcut in the Control Center.<br/>

&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is only available for developers right now, but Apple plans to release a public beta in July. The software will launch in September alongside new iPhones.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ios-26-background-sounds/">Here Are the New Background Sounds in iOS 26</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-the-new-background-sounds-in-ios-26.2458528/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
