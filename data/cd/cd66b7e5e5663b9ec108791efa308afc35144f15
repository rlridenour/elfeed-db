<p>Poland&#x27;s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said an explosion on the Warsaw–Lublin rail line near the village of Mika on the weekend was an act of sabotage that could have been meant to derail a train, and investigators have opened a criminal probe. The line connects the capital toward eastern Poland and is used to move aid and military supplies toward Ukraine, making the disruption strategically sensitive. Emergency services and prosecutors worked at the scene after a high‑speed train driver noticed damage and warned nearby trains, preventing an immediate derailment, authorities said.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gLRqCZboBx5Lx_ICTOGWJ0WIm-GFMTOYC_h8zCoBEWfxuzmoufKr9Z04l9b5WUipX9-XmNgreksTDVbNLgZdw-LRmDyO8noM86Vtky-w2I1R3u-BMe1iozzDZBb7YAyVQ46dYpV-MSJTzTs8fnPK-akTDmaY2beLxJ_OgUGj2k2hS0xeAY-aqPEQ' alt='Prime Minister Donald Tusk and officials at the site of the explosion on the tracks in Mika, between Warsaw and Lublin.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Prosecutors&#x27; allegation: Poland&#x27;s national prosecutors opened an inquiry saying the sabotage may have been &quot;committed on behalf of a foreign intelligence service,&quot; elevating the case to a security investigation</li><li>Army inspection: Poland&#x27;s defence chief said the army will examine about 120 kilometres of the Warsaw–Lublin–Hrubieszów corridor to check for further damage or tampering</li><li>Government response: Interior and transport ministers, police and security-service representatives held emergency talks as authorities widened the investigation and secured affected sections</li><li>Caution on blame: Deputy interior minister Maciej Duszczyk warned officials not to immediately assign responsibility to any state, saying investigators would avoid premature conclusions</li></ul><blockquote>Unfortunately, the worst suspicions have been confirmed.
