<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog began a tightly secured, four-day visit to Australia on Monday, starting in Sydney. Outlets described the trip as focused on solidarity with Australia’s Jewish community after an antisemitic attack at a Hanukkah event at Sydney’s Bondi Beach late last year, though some reports differ on the details. Herzog visited the Bondi Beach memorial site and met victims’ families and survivors, with coverage framing the stop as part of the visit’s consoling purpose. At the same time, thousands of pro-Palestine demonstrators rallied in Sydney and Melbourne to oppose Herzog’s visit, pointing to Israel’s war in Gaza and to how Australia is handling protest rights during the trip. In Sydney, authorities declared the visit a “major event,” which gave police expanded powers in the city centre. Protest organisers challenged the declaration in court but lost; later, clashes during the rally saw police use pepper spray, drawing criticism from some politicians and allegations of excessive force. The day underscored two civic realities unfolding at once: a community-focused visit centred on mourning and reassurance, and large public demonstrations testing how Australia balances security, public order, and the right to protest.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ycvWu8uTfcgPwSFDs9ChMwr951qtUPwxPLqWhrkAnhU2Xs8Z54JdAUtbxXj_k6aRJEkPcTpmEjbyYQNJW1unsm3jMNW6QMeVMqngxCqt_BBHuwhYtcnrR6iNA6WBvj9Z0ZtiAldncVwrv4tqblvqSrFHAHliVdga4zMPYpUeRw' alt='Israeli President Isaac Herzog visits the Bondi Beach memorial site during his trip to Australia.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Court ruling detail: NSW Supreme Court Justice Robertson Wright dismissed the organisers’ challenge less than 45 minutes before the protest was due to begin, saying his conclusions were not reached “easily or lightly”.</li><li>Policing scale and assembly guidance: Reuters reported that authorities deployed thousands of police and urged protesters to gather in a central Sydney park rather than at Town Hall, citing public-safety concerns.</li><li>Arrest-risk warning: Coverage warned demonstrators they risked arrest if they joined a planned march from Sydney Town Hall to the New South Wales parliament during the visit.</li><li>Protest speakers: The Guardian reported that figures including Grace Tame and Lidia Thorpe addressed crowds at rallies in Sydney and Melbourne.</li><li>Itinerary specifics: Israel’s government press office said Herzog would address major communal events, meet leaders “across the political spectrum,” and conduct media interviews during the trip, alongside official meetings with the governor-general and prime minister.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Palestine Action Group (organisers): Organisers said they would proceed with the rally despite losing in court and were still seeking a compromise with police that would allow a march from Town Hall to Parliament House.
