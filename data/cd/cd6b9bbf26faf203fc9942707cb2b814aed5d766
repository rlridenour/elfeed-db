<blockquote>
  <p>Starting in 2015, Apple and Boeing held early discussions about a
satellite internet project that would involve delivering
full-blown wireless internet service, not just emergency
communications services, to iPhones and homes, said five people
involved in or briefed on the project.</p>

<p>Through the effort, dubbed Project Eagle within Apple, the
companies would lob thousands of Boeing satellites into orbit to
beam internet down to iPhones. For home users, Apple planned to
offer antennas people could stick to their windows to disperse
their internet connection throughout the building. (Satellite
internet requires a device to have an uninterrupted line of sight
to the sky.)</p>

<p>For the project’s champions, it was an ambitious gambit to provide
a more seamless Apple experience. Some inside Apple saw mobile
carriers as necessary but inconvenient partners that held the
company’s iPhone plans back. With a global satellite system, Apple
could provide more of the key ingredients for its products,
reducing its dependency on outside partners.</p>

<p>The lead executive and architect behind the project was Apple’s
longtime wireless chief, Rubén Caballero. Apple spent around $36
million testing out the concept at a secret location in El
Segundo, Calif., the people with knowledge of the project said.
The team aimed to launch the service in 2019.</p>

<p>But eventually Apple got cold feet. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, was
concerned that the project would jeopardize the company’s
relationship with the telecom industry, said people with direct
knowledge of the project. It was also an expensive undertaking
with an unclear near-term business case. At the end of 2016, Apple
canceled the project. (Caballero <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-executive-responsible-for-5g-efforts-departs">left the company</a> in 2019.)</p>

<p>The segment I quote here is midway through the article. It leads with purported offers from Elon Musk to Apple to rely exclusively on Starlink for satellite networking. Starlink offers a <a href="https://x.com/jasonfried/status/1873056615345340566">genuinely incredible service</a>. But there’s no way Apple was going to make a <em>get into bed together</em> deal with Elon Musk. Starlink’s technology and satellite coverage are extraordinary, but Musk personally is just too erratic. It’s a bizarre, dare I say unprecedented, combination. He’s like Howard Hughes but with much better tech (and, perhaps, fewer bottles of his own urine strewn about his bedroom).</p>
