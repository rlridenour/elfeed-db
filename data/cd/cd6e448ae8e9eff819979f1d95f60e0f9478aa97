<p>At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney warned that the international system is facing a “rupture,” arguing that major powers are increasingly using trade and financial tools as leverage. Several reports describe his remarks as directed at President Trump’s approach to alliances and economic pressure, with Carney urging countries like Canada to work more closely with other “middle powers” to protect their interests. President Trump responded from the same Davos stage by chiding Canada and arguing it benefits heavily from the United States, framing the relationship in more transactional terms. Despite the sharp exchange, the Davos setting underscored that both leaders still engaged in a shared global forum—leaving room for diplomacy alongside disagreement.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/vtOimYEP7S6hkrjY2fUeaMswbWA0WOrTM36vLBV_UNOZfI4-Dlhcrj1WpbD8DQWCsDRiUHnKlfm0TiV3eCJIFto45VxDvgI7Q_ommDI8Sv923ypwQ0_JHQwtjmst1huetVMgv68Zt_qadBajwBDhze3l9YyYu0KiPhpt1UufUxoTBiZNeqQntAyJWEaYj5nR6PqHBp9GzQk5vsr7v4OhO-WJOTmqcbEf3XG9YObKPSfIIyQcXqHPQxowJfeYfxIRdXaLgCDJCCZPIRj0ZF_7dW1p4_iBt9MnWso9Qod-4DcIFpRb0idNco5aT-TnKCVcML_AfzLUW3YLmqijjHZtQ2uYx5i0lo_HkFfq6SiZnbaWmEcjbKyt8tkW4pD_dTb5bZ2y1SRvgla2fmM8Bw' alt='President Donald Trump speaks at the World Economic Forum in Davos after remarks by Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Middle powers: Carney argued that countries between the superpowers should coordinate more tightly, warning that “if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu,” a call aimed at boosting collective leverage in a more competitive era.</li><li>Standing ovation: Multiple outlets reported that Carney’s address received a standing ovation in Davos, signaling strong resonance among many attendees even as President Trump appeared unimpressed.</li><li>Low-carbon pitch: Carney’s Davos remarks also emphasized sustainable finance and the need for governments, investors, and institutions to cooperate on a fair transition toward a low-carbon economy.</li><li>Greenland remark: Semafor reported that before traveling to Davos, President Trump declined to rule out using military force to seize Greenland, a comment cited as part of broader allied anxiety about U.S. posture.</li><li>Canada as state: Carney referenced President Trump’s earlier talk about Canada becoming the “51st state,” presenting it as evidence that traditional geography-and-history assumptions no longer guarantee security.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prime Minister Mark Carney (Canada): Carney told Davos that the world order is undergoing a &quot;rupture&quot; and urged countries like Canada to act together with other middle powers rather than cling to the past order.
