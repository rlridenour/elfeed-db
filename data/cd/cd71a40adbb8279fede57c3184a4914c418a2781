<p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, on page 17 of her dissent in <em>National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a broader sense, however, today’s ruling is of a piece with
this Court’s recent tendencies. “[R]ight when the Judiciary
should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law’s
constraints,” the Court opts instead to make vindicating the rule
of law and preventing manifestly injurious Government action as
difficult as possible. This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a
twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules.<sup>6</sup>
We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration
always wins.</p>
