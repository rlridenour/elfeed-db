<p>The US government entered a partial shutdown early Saturday after Congress missed a funding deadline, even as the Senate approved a large, Trump-backed funding package that could limit the disruption to a couple of days. With the House of Representatives out of session until Monday, the shutdown was expected to last through the weekend, with the earliest House vote to reopen agencies possible on Monday. Negotiations stumbled over immigration enforcement and funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including Democratic objections tied to the killing of two protesters in Minneapolis by federal immigration agents, which several outlets said helped derail talks. The Senate package pairs five spending bills to fund many agencies through Sept. 30 with a two-week stopgap extension for DHS while lawmakers continue immigration-related negotiations. Even short shutdowns can create uncertainty for federal workers, contractors, and people relying on government services, though multiple reports emphasized leaders in both parties were signaling an expectation of a quick resolution once the House returns.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/061bh4JQbagHmseA1xOD0MEscz9IVLftR4dv0oINDlXKV3HXQwjuhw77kTXZE0V_bNZ4fm98-PytLdwtJs3an12cWJKhE1BTP7jWum5ViArEB2wQxPmwi8jeJKNH0Dlmx2VZ7JfGq5AwXIAQbcKeIa32RaPNQlrsCUy0dDaQe8tXovSKTbMKnjNN_hoWazoHrA' alt='The US Capitol as lawmakers debate a funding package to reopen agencies.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Senate vote: The Senate passed the $1.2 trillion compromise package 71-29, with President Trump publicly urging approval and only five of 53 Republicans voting no.</li><li>Democrats split: Senate Democrats were divided, with 24 of 47 caucus members opposing the package despite the overall passage.</li><li>Fast-track plan: Speaker Mike Johnson told House Republicans the most likely path is a fast-track process Monday evening that would require a two-thirds majority and therefore substantial Democratic support.</li><li>Scope affected: Around three-quarters of federal operations were described as affected, prompting agencies to begin implementing shutdown plans across areas such as education, health, housing and defense.</li><li>Immigration debate: Several Democrats criticized the administration’s immigration enforcement focus and opposed the two-week DHS stopgap because it would keep ICE and Border Patrol funded at current levels while immigration restrictions are negotiated.</li></ul><blockquote>Instead of going after drug smugglers, child predators, and human traffickers, the Trump Administration is wasting valuable resources targeting peaceful protestors in Chicago and Minneapolis, - Dick Durbin</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: President Trump backed the compromise spending package and publicly urged lawmakers to approve it.
