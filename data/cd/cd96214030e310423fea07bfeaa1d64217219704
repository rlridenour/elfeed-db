Apple's iOS 26 update, currently in beta, brings a nice optional upgrade to screen capture quality with HDR (High Dynamic Range) capture support. The new feature captures or video-records what's on your iPhone's screen while preserving rich colors and detail. <br/>

HDR screenshots are particularly valuable when capturing content with high contrast – like bright app interfaces against dark backgrounds, HDR videos, or detailed photos. The enhanced dynamic range preserves details that would typically be lost in standard screenshots, making them ideal for sharing visual content or documenting app interfaces with greater fidelity.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Enable HDR Screenshots</h2><br/>
The following steps show you how to switch from standard to HDR screenshot capture:<br/>
<ol>  <br/>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li>  <br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>General</strong>.</li>  <br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Screen Capture</strong>.</li>  <br/>
<li>Under "Format," tap <strong>HDR</strong>.</li>  <br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/hdr-screenshots-ios.jpg" alt="settings" width="2778" height="2736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015969" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. Your iPhone will now capture all screenshots in HDR format, and video record in HEVC HDR10 format, providing superior image quality with enhanced dynamic range. Just be mindful that the trade-off is larger file sizes, as HDR captures store more image data than standard PNG screenshots and HEVC screen recording.<br/>
<br/>
To return to standard screenshot capture, simply select <strong>SDR (Most Compatible)</strong> under the same "Format" section in the settings menu.<br/>
