Following a study looking into the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/us-app-store-ecosystem-study-2024/">success of the App Store ecosystem</a> in the United States, Apple has sponsored a second study that covers the global <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> in 2024.<br/>

Apple's global &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; ecosystem supported an estimated &#36;1.3 trillion in billings and sales across 2024, and for 90 percent of those sales, developers did not pay a commission to Apple.<br/>
<blockquote>"It's incredible to see so many developers design great apps, build successful businesses, and reach Apple users around the world," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "This report is a testament to the many ways developers are enriching people's lives with app and game experiences, while creating opportunity and driving new innovations. We're proud to support their success."</blockquote><br/>
Developer billings and sales of digital goods and services hit &#36;131 billion, primarily from games and photo and video editing apps like those from Adobe. Sales of physical goods and services facilitated by &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; apps exceeded &#36;1 trillion.<br/>
<br/>
Over the last five years, spending in digital goods and services, physical goods and services, and in-app advertising has more than doubled, with the strongest growth in physical goods as people are increasingly using apps to order food and groceries.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; draws more than 813 million average weekly visitors globally, with Apple's commerce system supporting developers with more than 40 local currencies and tax handling in 200 regions.<br/>
<br/>
As with Apple's U.S. study, the global study highlights the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; benefits and tools available to developers, including the more than 100 technical sessions that will come out next week during the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference.<br/>
<br/>
The study's release comes as Apple is facing regulatory and legal pressure over its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules in multiple countries. In addition to being forced to allow developers to direct customers to web-based purchase options in the U.S., Apple is also continuing to struggle with the Digital Markets Act in Europe. Apple is currently fighting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-appeals-eu-dma-interoperability-rules/">DMA interoperability requirements</a> that require it to give third-party developers access to iOS features that are normally limited to Apple's own products, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/apple-breach-digital-markets-act-eu/">has faced fines</a> for compliance issues. <br/>
