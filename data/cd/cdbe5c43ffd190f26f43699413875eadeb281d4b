A total of 350 winners have been selected, and the winners are eligible to attend the &zwnj;WWDC 2025&zwnj; special event that will take place at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> on Monday, June 9.<br/>
<br/>
Of the 350, 50 will be named Distinguished Winners, and will be invited to Cupertino, California for a multi-day &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; event that will include the keynote meetup and additional opportunities to meet with Apple engineers and employees.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are not chosen as Distinguished Winners can enter Apple's lottery for a chance to attend the &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; event. Apple is inviting students and developers to apply, but since space is limited, attendees will be selected through a lottery process. Winners will be notified on Thursday, April 3.<br/>
