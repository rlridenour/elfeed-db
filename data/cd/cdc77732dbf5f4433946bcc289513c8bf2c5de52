<p>Up-and-coming San Francisco news site The San Francisco Standard <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/05/23/sam-altman-jony-ive-video/">breaks down</a> that <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/05/sam-and-jony-and-skepticism/">Sam and Jony video</a> in depth:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  While the clip was full of fawning descriptions of each other — and a suspicious number of “ordinary San Franciscans” with the apparent gift of time travel — it was light on details about what Ive and Altman are cooking up. But since the trailer for the <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/05/20/olivia-wilde-seth-rogen-movie-filming-in-san-francisco/">Seth Rogen flick filming</a> in San Francisco has yet to drop, The Standard’s staff had nothing better to do than break down the video in excruciating detail. Enjoy!

<p>Details include spotting the extras, being judgmental about the café selection, and questioning Sam Altman’s grasp of Silicon Valley history.</p>
