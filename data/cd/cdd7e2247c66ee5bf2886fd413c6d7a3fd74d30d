LG announced multiple new TVs and displays at its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2026/">CES 2026</a> event, and showed off some older tech. Last year's 32-inch UltraFine Evo 6K monitor was on display, and of all LG's displays, this one looks like it was made for macOS. Text is crisp, the scale is perfect, Thunderbolt 5 is supported, and the NanoIPS panel provides deeper blacks and better contrast than a standard IPS panel.<br/>
<br/>
There were a couple new gaming displays, including a 27-inch tandem OLED monitor with a 720Hz refresh rate, and a 52-inch 5K 240Hz display that LG says is the world's largest gaming monitor. LG also showed off new OLED TVs, microRGB TVs for improved color accuracy, and a frame TV option to match the Sony Frame TV. And of course all of the TVs have new AI features.<br/>
<br/>
At Pepcom, MCON had a &#36;145 <a href="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller">ultra portable gaming controller</a> designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. It uses <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> to snap to the back of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and it includes full-size joysticks, tactile buttons, triggers, and fold-out grips. MCON actually showed off the controller last year, but now it's ready to ship out in late January.<br/>
<br/>
Aukey was showing off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/04/aukey-magfusion-ark/">the MagFusion Ark</a>, a modular wireless charger that supports 25W Qi2.2 charging. The Ark has a 6-in-1 design with a base that can charge up to three devices, plus three detachable power bank spheres for charging on the go.<br/>
<br/>
The &#36;150 <a href="https://www.aukey.com/blogs/tech/aukey-introduces-magfusion-deskhive-5x-pro-redefining-desktop-charging-at-ces-2026">MagFusion DeskHive</a> is an all-new charger from Aukey, featuring a 25W wireless charging puck for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; plus two built-in retractable USB-C cables. It includes a digital display that shows real-time power output for each port, and a USB-C port that offers up to 140W charging. Both Aukey chargers are coming in the second quarter of 2026.<br/>

InnAIO, a company that sells an AI voice cloning device, had a portrait featuring an AI version of Vincent van Gogh that talked to attendees. It was just one of many borderline creepy AI products that made an appearance.<br/>
<br/>
Ambient highlighted <a href="https://www.helloambient.com/dreamie">the &#36;250 Dreamie</a>, a bedside sleep companion that provides an alarm, a soft light for a sunrise wakeup, and audio soundscapes to listen to so you can ditch your phone at night. <a href="https://us.tonies.com">Tonies</a> was showing off its next-generation box with improved sound quality, longer battery life, better connectivity, and a refreshed design. It's also more responsive and interactive.<br/>
<br/>
Satechi showed off the &#36;400 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/06/satechi-thunderbolt-5-cubedock/">Thunderbolt 5 CubeDock</a>, which looks a lot like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>. It has multiple Thunderbolt 5 ports and everything else you could need, including an SSD enclosure that supports up to 8TB. Twelve South was at Pepcom to promote <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/05/twelve-south-unveils-qi2-valet-tray/">the &#36;180 Valet</a>, a Qi2 charger that also serves as a catchall tray.<br/>
