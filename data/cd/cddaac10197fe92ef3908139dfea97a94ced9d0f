<p>Chileans went to the polls on Sunday to choose a successor to term-limited President Gabriel Boric in an election dominated by rising crime and a heated debate over immigration, especially Venezuelan migration. The top-ticket contest pits the government&#x27;s former labor minister and communist-backed candidate against a far-right contender who has praised Augusto Pinochet and vowed hardline immigration measures, including threats of mass deportations. Polls show right-leaning candidates drawing strong support but a newly introduced compulsory voting law could bring many new voters and add uncertainty to first-round results, making a December run-off likely if no candidate clears 50 percent.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Fy_zoI1DUPdsfHMchuIx6_pK6xLG6sfliHFUClYd8uLeXOp80C9lKGcdf8VRTr7iJGL8HHMPMMRuTz0Tk8iIwMt86o6Gp6AsYh9k6t9Vlfr9QxTt4NG168TzwVjbhKxvaYuSAILPKbLphy6acoUvtJvra9JGXoGA3zrqGeQEeTrcv6sjfgR5Bpg1QbLde9181VSsb_D43HRWSry6wIoBuCD5' alt='Preparations at a polling station in Santiago ahead of Chile’s presidential election.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Voter concerns: Many Chilean voters say rising violence is tied to gangs from other Latin American countries, making security a decisive campaign issue</li><li>Immigration focus: Venezuelan migration emerged as a central electoral topic, affecting local businesses and everyday life in Santiago neighborhoods</li><li>Candidate background: The far-right front-runner has publicly praised Pinochet and is reported in some outlets to be the son of a Nazi officer, a detail opponents highlight during the campaign</li><li>Tough rhetoric: Campaign language includes calls for an &#x27;iron fist&#x27; approach and proposals compared by reporters to Donald Trump–style mass deportations</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Far-right candidate: Campaign rhetoric emphasizes strict measures on crime and large-scale deportations of undocumented migrants, arguing security must be restored.
