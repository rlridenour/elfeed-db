The new record comes after some Wall Street analysts and reports said there has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/20/iphone-17-lineup-sales-outperforming-iphone-16/">strong demand for Apple's new iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max models</a>, although the iPhone Air is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/17/iphone-air-production-to-be-cut-amid-lower-sales/">reportedly less of a hit</a> overall, despite a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/17/iphone-air-sells-out-in-china/">hot start in China</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple achieved the record high despite continuing to lag behind companies like OpenAI and Google in the generative artificial intelligence space. Over the weekend, it was reported that some of Apple's software engineers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/19/ios-26-4-revamped-siri-concerns/">have "concerns"</a> about how well the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/tim-cook-shares-personalized-siri-update/">more personalized version of Siri</a> works on an internal iOS 26.4 beta for the iPhone.<br/>
