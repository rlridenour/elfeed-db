<p>Ever since I&rsquo;ve decided to move away from iCloud<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, I&rsquo;ve had a hard time syncing my org files with Beorg, which is how I worked with org-mode tasks on my iPhone. Frustrated, I looked into a solution that I should have revisited long ago: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/plain-org/id1578965002">Plain Org</a>.</p>
<p>I got Plain Org before I heard of Journelly, so it&rsquo;s not just because I&rsquo;m a fan of <a href="https://xenodium.com">Álvaro</a>&rsquo;s work. At the time, I was just looking for an app that could read org files and lay out my projects in a nice, clear way. As it turns out, Plain Org does more than that - by doing less.</p>
<p>Compared to Beorg, Plain Org is very minimal. But it works with Synctrain (Syncthing for iOS), it accesses my org files on my iPhone quickly and easily, and it lets me make quick modifications when needed. For everything else, there&rsquo;s Emacs. And that&rsquo;s what I seem to have forgotten.</p>
<p>It took me a while to reconnect with the understanding that my iPhone is not the place to manage tasks and projects, despite what everyone around me seems to think, whether it&rsquo;s my workplace with its Microsoft Office suite or Apple with its ever-improving Notes and Reminders. As I <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/10/27/emacs-and-mental-challanges.html">mentioned earlier</a>, other apps look and work great, as long as you play by their rules. As soon as you need something customized for your needs, you&rsquo;re out of luck. I can play by the rules to an extent, but not when it comes to how I think and work. I guess I had to write it out here to arrive at that conclusion again, and surprise surprise, things are working out again.</p>
<p>What followed was reorganizing all my org files. A deep system cleaning that was much overdue. First, I archived many of them in my archive folder. Next, I went into my projects org file itself and archived a big chunk of projects that should have been completed and/or put away a long time ago. The trick was to remind myself that archiving is not the same as throwing away something: it&rsquo;s simply putting it out of sight. It&rsquo;s a simple rule: if it just sits there staring me in the face for more than a week, it needs to be archived. If I need to work on it again, I can put it back: org-refile is a powerful tool. I can always go into my archive folder, which is <em>not</em> a part of my agenda on purpose, and search through it with occur or consult-grep.</p>
<p>Speaking of my org-agenda: I got rid of scheduled TODO tasks, and I&rsquo;m trying to keep it this way.</p>
<p>The kind of work I do today is 100% projects. There&rsquo;s no such thing as a simple task; if it&rsquo;s simple, it gets delegated. This means each project header, which is signified by the keyword ACTIVE, has somewhere between 5 to 20 subheaders: meetings, additional tickets, purchases, notes, emails, documents attached with org-attach, you name it.</p>
<p>Making these subheaders into scheduled TODO items quickly overwhelms my agenda and hurts motivation. Besides, I was stuck in the habit of always having a next-action item for every single thing, so many of those TODOs just ended up being something like &ldquo;Follow Up&rdquo; or &ldquo;Reminder.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a waste. A project is already marked with &ldquo;ACTIVE&rdquo; for a reason, after all. I know I need to follow up on something, that&rsquo;s the entire point. The other thing is that the project header (the parent header) should be the header I work with. It&rsquo;s where I keep my logbook notes (<code>C-c C-z</code>), and where I clock in and out. I used to do this for each subtask, but then I had to think about which notes go under which task, and it made it harder to follow up later, as I had to search across different tasks containing different fragments of notes. It&rsquo;s too much running in circles. Now I just look at my list of projects, pick one to work on, and start a clock (<code>C-c C-x C-i</code>). When I&rsquo;m done, I clock out  (<code>C-c C-x C-i</code>) and write a few notes about what I did.</p>
<p>I still use subheaders when I need to save something (like an email, a ticket, or meeting notes), or when I work on something that takes more than half an hour on its own.</p>
<p>My work environment is a hectic mess these days, and Emacs is the only thing that is flexible enough (as always) to deal with&hellip; everything. The amount of productivity and communication apps people at work around me use is staggering, but they all work in the browser, need to be online, and don&rsquo;t allow to customize things.</p>
<p>I need to be able to organize my head in Emacs. This is so important that I&rsquo;m considering enforcing a small unofficial &ldquo;break&rdquo; during the day when I <em>just</em> sit down and clean up my projects and actually do some stuff. Otherwise I&rsquo;ll be stuck all day just running after emails.</p>
<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
<p><sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Many folks use iCloud and are happy with it, so why do I make my life difficult? The two technical reasons are my Linux desktop, which I use to access some of my org files, and my Android, which is more like a backup device to capture some notes. Another reason is the lack of control of iCloud: it works most of the time, but when it doesn&rsquo;t, it really messed me up. It just stays stuck and doesn&rsquo;t sync for whatever reason, and in case of a conflict, iCloud &ldquo;decides&rdquo; which file is the right one and overwrites whatever was there before. When I lost some work because of this recently, it was the last straw. Syncthing would always create a conflict file,  where I can run Diff in emacs and quickly decide what I want to keep. It also has a built-in file versioning in its folders, which has saved me a couple of times in the past.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the tinfoil hat: I&rsquo;m grumpy guy who yells at clouds. To put simply, I don&rsquo;t trust Apple to store my personal and private files. After viewing their <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/us.html">transperency report</a> I was surprised to find out they share data with law enforcement 70-80 percent of the time. I just don&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;think of the kids&rdquo; PG approach.</p>
