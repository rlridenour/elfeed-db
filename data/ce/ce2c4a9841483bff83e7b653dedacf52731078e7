Earlier this month, <em>MacRumors</em> was first to report that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/apple-partridge-creek-permanently-closing/">planning to permanently close its Partridge Creek store</a>, just outside of Detroit, Michigan, and now the company has announced a closure date for the location.<br/>

Apple Partridge Creek's final day of business will be Saturday, August 16, with the store set to close for good at 8 p.m. local time that day. All of the store's employees will have the opportunity to continue their roles with Apple, the company said.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added the following notice to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/partridgecreek/">store's page</a> this week:<blockquote>Thank you, Partridge Creek. Apple Partridge Creek is closing on August 16 at 8pm. We're still here for you. Please visit apple.com/retail to find your nearest store.</blockquote>The store is located in Clinton Township, a northern suburb of Detroit. It opened in 2007.<br/>
<br/>
The closure comes as Apple prepares to open an <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/downtowndetroit/">all-new store in Downtown Detroit</a> on Woodward Avenue, near Grand River Avenue. In a statement shared with <em>MacRumors</em> earlier this month, Apple said that location will be opening at some point <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/apple-partridge-creek-permanently-closing/">later this year</a>.<br/>
