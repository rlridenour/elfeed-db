</ul><h1>Oh Thank Heaven</h1><p>We know how it feels sometimes. We make a big deal about our commitment to community and our active forums and whatnot, when in reality, it can seem like you’re commenting into the void.</p>
<p>But this time, we listened.</p>
<p>See, we sold some sour gummi candies recently, and the comments on that sale? Well, let’s just say, y’all had some requests.</p>
<p>Like this one from <a href="/@Stars_N_Stripes">@Stars_N_Stripes</a>69:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gummi fettuccine? Sorry, Vincenzo, but last time I checked, this here ain’t Italia, capeesh? Our forefathers didn’t get nasty on the battlefields so we could all sit around eating something that vaguely resembles and is named after a dish from a country across the ocean. No, some of us want to support truly patriotic companies, brands that aren’t afraid to wear their American values on their sleeve, like Budweiser. Can you provide gummies for customers like that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this one, from <a href="/@WhatIsReal">@WhatIsReal</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ve sold grape-flavored gummies. And you’ve discussed banana-flavored candy. Now, why don’t you offer something for those of us who admire accuracy, a fruit flavor that always tastes exactly like the fruit it’s mimicking? For example, watermelon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this one too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I moved here to oversee the inn bequeathed to me by an unsigned letter, what bothered me most was not the ever-gray skies above or the ever-tumultuous sea at the base of the cliff on which the property sits. No, my main frustration was that the local village had no convenience store wherein I might enjoy a taquito and some gummi candies. Could you offer one of these two products, please?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(We didn’t include a username for that last one because it actually came to us via a one-eyed carrier pigeon in whose coos we heard strange incantations spoken in a dead language.)</p>
<p>Anyway, point is: you asked, we listened!</p>
<p>So here you have it: some gummi “patriotic” stars and watermelon wedges from 7-Select. And yes, that is 7-Eleven’s brand.</p>
<p>Buy it if you want it.</p>
<p>And let’s be real, you do want it.</p>
