<p>Apple just updated the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/apple-sports/id6446788829">Apple Sports</a> app to version 3.0. In the 16 months since <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/02/apple-sports-a-free-iphone-app-to-get-you-the-score-fast/">the app was first introduced</a>, it’s added a bunch of features. Ben Mayo at 9to5Mac has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/25/apple-sports-app-redesigned-tennis-scores/">the details about this update</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The home screen layout has been revamped, with upcoming games now separated by league. You can further personalize the list by re-ordering the sections to their preference, so you can make the sports you are most interested in appear first, and starred teams always show at the very top. And, just in time for Wimbledon, the app has now added tennis scores.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The tennis coverage adds support for both the men’s and women’s tours, but you can’t follow individual players and it’s just for coverage of Grand Slams and the next tier down, 1000 level events. Backgrounds will change based on the court surface, so the green of Wimbledon will be up first.</p>
<p>The baseball screen has been updated to display the pitcher and hitter matchup directly beneath the score.</p>
<p>Though Apple Sports probably launched a bit prematurely, it has grown a lot over the past year and I find myself turning to it when I want a quick glimpse at what’s going on in a sport or league I care about.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the app is still only available on iPhone and in the U.S., UK, and Canada.</p>
