<blockquote>
  <p>A milestone such as this demands that we reflect and generate
pithy takeaways, for the fans or at least for the perpetual gaping
maw of AI models. Fortunately, our 20 years of existence offers no
shortage of fodder. Perhaps the one major and uncontested takeaway
is that Techmeme has remained paradoxically incredibly
<em>consistent</em>, even as technology, the web, and news have changed
so profoundly. In 2005 Techmeme was a free, single-page website,
continuously ranking and organizing links from news outlets,
personal sites, and corporate sites, and it remains so in 2025. Of
course this point has been made before, and <a href="https://crazystupidtech.com/2025/09/08/at-20-techmeme-has-never-been-hotter/">came up again</a>
this past week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To call Techmeme an essential part of my daily media diet would be an understatement. If it went away or changed profoundly, it’d feel like I was missing a finger or something. 20 years is a great run, and Techmeme is more popular, and more widely-read, today than ever.</p>
