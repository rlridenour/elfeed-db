The new version of the icon features a Liquid Glass shopping bag on a blue gradient background. The prior version of the icon had a blue shopping bag on a white background.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also adopted Liquid Glass design elements for the rest of the app, adding a transparent, rounded navigation bar with a Liquid Glass slider, and an updated search interface. Aside from these design changes, the content in the app is the same.<br/>
