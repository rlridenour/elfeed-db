<p><a href="https://plainorg.com">Plain Org</a> v1.4 is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002">App Store</a>.</p>
<p>I was on a long flight recently 🦘, so I gave list and checkbox editing a little love. There's a couple of other minor improvements included.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of <a href="https://plainorg.com">Plain Org</a>, it gives you access to <a href="https://orgmode.org">org</a> files on iPhone while away from your beloved <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>.</p>
<p>I love org markup, but we (iPhone + org users) are a fairly niche bunch. If you're finding Plain Org useful, <strong>please help support this effort</strong> by getting the word out.

<p>On to v1.4 release notes…</p>
<h2>Improved list/checkbox editing</h2>
<p>Adding list or checkbox items is traditionally cumbersome via the iPhone's keyboard. This release adds new toolbar actions and smart return to simplify things.</p>

<h2>Render form feed characters</h2>
<p>Form feed characters are now rendered within expanded headings.</p>

<p>Note: There's a limitation. Form feed characters at the end of a heading aren't currently displayed.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>Increased all button tap areas in edit toolbar. This should hopefully improve interaction.</p>
