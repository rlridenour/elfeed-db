<h2>Top Stories</h2><br/>
<h3>Report: Tim Cook to Step Down as Apple CEO 'as Soon as Next Year'</h3><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/report-tim-cook-to-step-down-as-soon-as-next-year/">preparing for Tim Cook to step down as CEO of the company "as soon as next year,"</a> according to the <em>Financial Times</em>. The company's board of directors and senior executives "recently intensified preparations for Cook to hand over the reins," the report said, with Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, John Ternus, viewed as Cook's most likely successor.<br/>

Cook will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/tim-cook-might-not-fully-retire/">likely transition to a chairman role with Apple</a>, but his level of influence in a post-CEO role remains to be seen. Arthur Levinson, the current chairman of Apple's board of directors, is 75 years old and prohibited from being re-elected under Apple's corporate governance policy unless an exception is made.<br/>
<br/>
Word of Cook's impending retirement comes as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/15/apple-executive-jeff-williams-retires/">former Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams officially retired last week</a> after spending the past few months winding down his responsibilities and handing them off other executives.<br/>

<h3>Mac Pro Reportedly on 'Back Burner' and 'Largely Written Off' at Apple</h3><br/>
Apple's high-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/16/mac-pro-on-back-burner-largely-written-off/">Mac Pro desktop computer is currently "on the back burner,"</a> according to the latest word from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Mac-Pro-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-880541" /><br/>
In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter this week, Gurman said he heard that Apple has "largely written off" the Mac Pro, with the sentiment inside the company being that the Mac Studio represents the present and future of Apple's pro desktop computing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is working on a high-end M5 Ultra chip, but Gurman said the company is currently "only" focused on a new Mac Studio with that chip, which leads him to believe that the Mac Pro "won't be updated in 2026 in a significant way."<br/>

<h3>iPhone 17 vs. iPhone 16 Wi-Fi Speeds: New Study Reveals the Winner</h3><br/>
A new study has revealed that the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone Air <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/18/ookla-apple-n1-chip-iphone-17-wifi-study/">achieve significantly faster average Wi-Fi speeds</a> compared to the iPhone 16 series, thanks to Apple's custom-designed N1 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/iPhone-17-Pro-and-Air-N1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020530" /><br/>
The study by Ookla, the company behind the popular Speedtest website and app, found the N1 chip to be a "substantial upgrade," with up to 40% faster average download and upload speeds compared to Broadcom's Wi-Fi chip in the iPhone 16 series. <br/>
<br/>
Ookla found that the N1 chip "lifts the floor" for Wi-Fi performance, more than "raising the ceiling." Based on the results, Ookla said the N1 chip often delivers more consistent performance in challenging Wi-Fi conditions.<br/>
