It wasn&rsquo;t that difficult to come up with a counterargument that&rsquo;s also part of the <a href="/tags/flemish-culture">Flemish canon</a>. In <em>F.C. De Kampioenen</em> (&ldquo;The Champions&rdquo;), a long running Flemish sitcom about misunderstandings and misadventures of a lowly ranked football team, Pascale De Backer&mdash;the ex-wife of the ex-trainer of the club that runs the café that is not of René<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>&mdash;has been pictured playing the Game Gear:</p>

</p>
<p>Pascale is playing the mobile version of Sonic in season 12, episode 2 called <em>Stoelendans</em> (dancing chairs I guess?). For exactly ten seconds, we hear the iconic theme song of Sonic playing and the <em>ploing</em> jumping sound as she presses the buttons, before throwing the thing aside and calling her daughter. She&rsquo;s alone that evening and having a hard time adjusting after her daughter and son-in-law just moved out. Bieke, her daughter, is fed up with Pascale constant checking up on her.</p>
<p>This is different from Sinterklaas playing the Game Boy for a few key reasons. First, Sinterklaas is having fun, while Pascale is just seeking a distraction and doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with herself. Second, Sinterklaas, being the saint of the children, is an authority when it comes to toys, while Pascale is just a lonely café owner. Yet <em>De Kampioenen</em>, with more than twenty seasons, is one of the most watched Flemish TV shows of all time, and loved by virtually everyone&mdash;even the ones who saw the unfortunate downfall after season eight or so.</p>
<p>The strangest part of this very short Game Gear appearance is that episode 2 of season 12 originally aired in 2001&mdash;the launch year of the Game Boy Advance. The GBA got to us Europeans in the late summer of 2001, and season 2 aired the 15th December 2001. Why didn&rsquo;t they have Pascale play <em>Mario Advance</em>?</p>
<p>At first, I couldn&rsquo;t trace the exact episode in which the above scene takes place. Being the handheld game nerd that I am, I remembered the Game Gear scene, but I misremembered the period. I went looking for it in seasons five, six, and seven because my mind reconstructed the scene as a time period correct one, when the Game Gear was in full motion. Considered it ever was in motion at all. Dang it, I did it again, sorry Sega.</p>
<p>Perhaps the crew asked Danni Heylen who portrayed Pascale to bring a handheld device. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna do a scene in which you&rsquo;re lonely and bored, bring an electronic device to play on the couch so our viewers can place the feeling&rdquo;. If she brought a Game Boy&mdash;any Game Boy would do here&mdash;she certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be bored. Ah dang it, again!?</p>
<p>The Game Gear was discontinued in 1997, only six years after its initial release. Four years later, it pops up in <em>F.C. De Kampioenen</em>. It turns out to be next to impossible to find local historical sales data to see when the popularity of the Game Gear dipped into obscureness here in Belgium. I do remember Sega being stronger than initially suspected: we had a Mega Drive instead of a SNES and a buddy did own the Game Gear. Me and my sisters didn&rsquo;t: we went the Game Boy&mdash;and later, Color&mdash;route.</p>
<p>The suspected reasons for that? A couple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The overabundance of Game Boy games available back then (on school playgrounds, during vacation trips, in shops, &hellip;)</li>
<li>The GB&rsquo;s 4 batteries lasted for 20 hours. The GG&rsquo;s 6 batteries for nearly 4.</li>
<li>The GG initially sold for <code>$150</code>&mdash;that&rsquo;s almost <code>€295</code> nowadays. The GB? The Pocket revision released in 1996 started at <code>$70</code>. That&rsquo;s less than half the price!</li>
<li>Who are you going to Link Cable Play <em>Tetris</em> and <em>Mortal Kombat</em> with if you were the poor soul with rich parents that got you a Game Gear for Christmas?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s got colours, but that&rsquo;s basically it. Technically, the Game Gear was essentially a shrunken down Sega Master System, which was impressive considering the Game Boy couldn&rsquo;t even emulate the NES until the 1998 Color revision came by. So why does Pascale like hers so much? The still image I captured might evoke &ldquo;liking&rdquo; but the scene in motion does not do a very good job at convincing potential buyers. For that, we&rsquo;ll need Sinterklaas.</p>
