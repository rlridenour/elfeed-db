<hr />
<p>Deputy Jacobs and Agent Mink each paced back and forth inside the station. It was well past midnight.</p>
<p>“He should’ve been here by now,” Deputy Jacobs said. He took off his hat and rubbed the sweat off his brow.</p>
<p>“Relax,” said Agent Mink. “Beacher always comes through.” But still, she checked her watch.</p>
<p>Just then, the door swung open, and there he was: Jake Beacher, all six feet six, two hundred sixty-five pounds of him. It would’ve been a welcome sight if he weren’t so bruised and cut and battered.</p>
<p>The other two rushed him.</p>
<p>“Beacher!” Deputy Jacobs said. “You made it!”</p>
<p>“Barely, by the looks of it,” said Agent Mink. “Jesus, Beacher, we sent you to escort State Senator Janson home after a campaign event, not take on the army of a small nation!”</p>
<p>“What happened out there, man?” Deputy Jacobs said. “You run into the Hells Bells Gang and have to punch your way out of trouble?”</p>
<p>“Or did you take a wrong turn,” said Agent Mink, “end at a secret government facility, see things you couldn’t unsee, and have to bash skulls until there was nothing left in your way?”</p>
<p>“Or, I know,” offered Deputy Jacobs. “While escorting State Senator Janson, he mentioned something, clueing you into some serious corruption, which you investigated… with the heel of your boot.”</p>
<p>“Worst than all that,” Reacher said, sitting down and taking the cup of black coffee the deputy handed him. “Hydroplaning.”</p>
<p>The other two looked at each other. “Sorry, what?” said the deputy.</p>
<p>“After I dropped of State Senator Janson, I hit a puddle,” said Beacher. “Went right off the road. Sorry, Agent Mink. I appreciate you lending me your car, but I really messed it up. Flipped it. Although that’s not what all this is from. You see, I couldn’t get out. So I had to punch through the window and eat my way out of the seatbelt, then build a torch with a big stick and some brush I found in the ditch. There will be some serious work to do, but I at least saved you the tow by carrying the car back with my free hand.”</p>
<p>“Umm… thank you?” Agent Mink said.</p>
<p>“But how did this happen?” Deputy Jacobs said. “You’re usually such a great driver.”</p>
<p>“My facial muscles are as strong as my others,” Beacher clarified. “Sometimes they seize up and I can’t see <em>anything</em>. Also, I misspoke before. I didn’t punch the window and eat the seatbelt. I punched myself out of the seatbelt, hence all the bruises, and ate the window.”</p>
<p>“But Beacher,” said Agent Mink. “I told you: there’s a tool in the glove compartment. It’s a flashlight and an emergency flare, plus it can cut seatbelts and break windows. It’s a great addition to any car, and I got a two-pack of them on a website called Meh for twenty bucks.”</p>
<p>“Pfft,” said Beacher. “Meh! That’s funny. But I’ll tell you what’s really meh. This coffee! Seriously, deputy, what did you put in this to make it taste so much like pennies?”</p>
<p>“That’s probably just blood from the window you ate, Beacher,” said Deputy Jacobs.</p>
<p>“Yeah, let’s get you to a hospital, big guy,” said Agent Mink.</p>
