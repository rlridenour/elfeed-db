<p>Sudan’s army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has rejected the latest ceasefire proposal presented by US Special Envoy Massad Boulos on behalf of the Quad group of mediators, calling it the &quot;worst yet&quot; and signalling that fighting with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) will continue for now. Burhan argues the plan is biased because the United Arab Emirates, which he accuses of backing the RSF, is part of the Quad alongside the United States, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. He insists that any acceptable peace deal must require RSF fighters to withdraw from areas they currently control and be confined to specified zones, a condition critics say could complicate negotiations. The UAE denies arming the RSF, while Washington continues trying to mediate despite Burhan’s criticism of its envoy’s approach.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/y_ChL3uA373TyZFRFiQJu0kUb2TeRWAA11SzzZK4KfEe-jSbMcO6obUprefq9lK8mHxAJ59W55GsEndqHswpZ2znjxVzRK53LNDBjJ7fhk2-eEFK1F6G-WWo4_0qpQk0Ib8k8ymnwtrvAihejOAcZzi-QQM7_WCBd_2Jujl9u2hqMqq8VZyVCg8C-Iz3SlNNav13zVh0ZBicyMVY-VzITrg0rQ3apYjBYRns5nthxfbjcIHoEGJjZQd8COskHduqqB1s7261kUo0V2X5R38' alt='Civilians move between Sudan and Chad at the Tine border crossing as conflict between Sudan’s army and the RSF continues.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Quad mediators: The ceasefire initiative Burhan rejected was advanced by the Quad — a grouping that brings together the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates to seek a negotiated end to Sudan’s war.</li><li>Bias allegations: Burhan claims US envoy Massad Boulos is &quot;echoing&quot; Abu Dhabi’s positions and argues that the Quad cannot be neutral while a state he accuses of aiding the RSF is at the mediation table.</li><li>UAE’s response: The UAE has publicly rejected accusations that it supplies weapons or support to the RSF and maintains it backs diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, countering Burhan’s assertions of Emirati responsibility for prolonging the war.</li><li>Burhan’s conditions: Beyond a total RSF pullback, Burhan wants the force restricted geographically under any future agreement, a demand that goes further than earlier positions and may harden the Sudanese army’s negotiating stance.</li><li>Border displacement: As the conflict drags on, people continue crossing between Sudan and neighbouring Chad at border posts such as Tine, underscoring how the stalled talks affect civilians seeking safety and basic services.</li></ul><blockquote>The worst we have seen so far - General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Sudanese Armed Forces leadership: Burhan argues that the proposed truce would effectively legitimise the RSF’s current territorial gains and insists that any agreement must first compel RSF fighters to retreat and be confined to clearly defined areas.
