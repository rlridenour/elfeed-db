<p>Cameroonians voted Sunday in a one-round presidential election as 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya—already the world’s oldest serving head of state—sought an eighth term after 43 years in power [dawn.com#1][abcnews.go.com#1][allafrica.com#1]. Analysts widely expected a Biya victory, with a divided opposition fielding 11 separate challengers and results due at the latest by Oct. 26 [pbs.org#1][allafrica.com#1][dawn.com#1]. Journalists observed crowds outside polling stations in Yaounde, and an electoral official said voting passed calmly before polls closed at 1700 GMT [dawn.com#1]. About eight million citizens were eligible to vote, and the presidency’s seven-year term means a win would extend Biya’s long tenure; his frequent time abroad has fueled public speculation about his health [dawn.com#1][abcnews.go.com#1][thehindu.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/m6sNsukkHHp_W4xpfMFSh8F_QmZcLtOexQAAErzpQZ9knc-tjLabWKA3pPaPQZye4r6MCJ6hPHT9MWGOKG0Fq6bIoOdSV3Q2E6mX6cSk' alt='Cameroonian President Paul Biya reacts after casting his ballot during the presidential election.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Elder statesman: Biya, 92, the world’s oldest serving head of state, first took office in 1982 and is bidding for another seven-year mandate [abcnews.go.com#1][pbs.org#1][dawn.com#1].</li><li>Opposition field: He faced 11 opponents amid a divided opposition, according to RFI/AllAfrica and local reporting [allafrica.com#1][dawn.com#1].</li><li>Calm voting: Polling closed at 1700 GMT, with the national electoral authority reporting a calm vote in the capital [dawn.com#1].</li><li>Results timing: Official results are expected by the latest Oct. 26 under the electoral timetable [pbs.org#1].</li><li>Youthful country: Half of Cameroon’s population is under 20, underscoring generational stakes in the election [dawn.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>Nothing is certain.
