<p>An Israeli airstrike on the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of Sidon on Tuesday killed at least 13 people and wounded others, Lebanese officials said, in what multiple outlets called the deadliest strike on Lebanon since last year&#x27;s ceasefire. The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas &quot;training compound&quot; in the camp; Hamas and local sources denied the presence of military installations and dismissed the claim as &quot;lies&quot;. The strike occurred amid continuing Israeli operations across southern Lebanon and strikes in Gaza that injured civilians, raising immediate concerns about pressure on the year‑long ceasefire.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Q5TbgFT1C_EK1lsUFAhTPKDQMgvEQdPryljEf1ZRCelrCWf4NCfb9hWXCgNg6vXTN745T28Dqiz3muIAnSPv2pK-jGGPzS89aFhXfxwNOMIyTR5hpr41AvVe3WBiVF1umiFfciNx8CJv539uVcCZxtenDXy1VEYx5UWCmtigQr2FDr2yWgmrXXSk8bgTyXi9Z1iAWtYg30gqR3iWjQo' alt='Members of the Lebanese Army gathered on Tuesday at the entrance of the Ain al‑Hilweh refugee camp after an Israeli strike.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Target specifics: Lebanese state media and local reporting said the drone struck a car in a mosque car park near the Khalid bin al‑Walid mosque inside Ain al‑Hilweh, while other accounts say a mini‑football pitch used by locals was hit.</li><li>Access and verification: Journalists were reportedly not allowed to view the immediate aftermath inside the camp, complicating independent verification of the Israeli military&#x27;s account.</li><li>Risk to ceasefire: Analysts and regional reporting warned the strike — described as the deadliest since the ceasefire — could heighten tensions and increase the risk of wider hostilities restarting.</li><li>Other civilian harm: Separately, an Israeli strike on the town of Al‑Tayri in southern Lebanon reportedly killed at least one civilian and injured others, including students on a school bus, according to Lebanese sources.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli military: The Israeli military said it struck militants it said were operating in a training compound in the crowded Ain al‑Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp, alleging the site had been used by Hamas to carry out attacks against Israel.
