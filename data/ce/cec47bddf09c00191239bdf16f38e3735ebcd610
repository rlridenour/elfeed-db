<p>Hurricane Melissa dissipated after battering parts of the western Caribbean, leaving at least 50 people dead across Jamaica, Haiti and other islands and causing widespread destruction . Melissa struck southwestern Jamaica at Category 5 strength — the strongest storm to directly hit the island in modern records and the first major hurricane there since 1988 — and then weakened as it moved northward . AccuWeather estimated total economic losses in the western Caribbean at roughly US$48–52 billion . Haiti suffered heavy, slow-moving rains that caused deadly flooding and left people missing, while Cuba was struck at Category 3 strength and reported extensive damage though no confirmed deaths as of the latest reports .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/XXkaKDHsg-GbDe7cVE5ZefreeZbdfad2pQxmErqy2oeMjhzc758eVaVElU5kcLG8b2UaZ6vOQ81ZMinjAiEvRHA9w5qC-rhnlAiVErhNEA1AD4VqD09CQpA1V9hD1sNhd-VoT_3__bwINI7_Rz0jCe7Ts0KL7kpHpVSrxFX42TwkqzzVJfn7YkR8qPirEvQEhCpS_NKsFGHE_U7bFJWHW1Xm6XcWPzPkORMpeEOm1zuXw1KsTEOqk1UNON5zDjlbDOD5RH1I8T8qIJaTzg' alt='A man walks along a flooded road after heavy rains from Hurricane Melissa caused deadly flooding in Petit Goave, Haiti, October 30, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Power and roofs: Roughly 60% of Jamaica was reported without electricity and some communities lost up to 90% of roofs, compounding shelter and recovery needs .</li><li>Medical shortages: Jamaica plans field hospitals in five western parishes after Melissa damaged health facilities and left doctors and nurses overstretched, and fuel stations in the west reported low supplies .</li><li>Deadly flash floods: In Haiti’s southern town of Petit-Goave a river burst its banks, killing at least 23 people including 10 children and damaging roads, homes and farmland .</li><li>Drone imagery: Drone footage and video captured widespread destruction and displacement across Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, showing flooded streets and cut-off communities .</li></ul><blockquote>It is a sad moment for the country - head of Haiti’s transitional presidential council</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Jamaica information minister: Officials confirmed at least 19 deaths and said there were indications more bodies would be recovered as search efforts continued.
