<blockquote><p>
Jones had been greatly depressed; he declared himself a murderer, and would not be comforted. Suddenly he asked me a question. &#8216;Are not the parents the cause of the birth of their children?&#8217; said he. &#8216;I suppose so,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Are not all men mortal?&#8217; &#8216;That also may be admitted.&#8217; &#8216;Then are not the parents the cause of the death of their children, since they know that they are mortal? And am I not a murderer?&#8217; I was, I own, puzzled. At last I thought of something soothing. I pointed out to Jones that to cause the death of another was not necessarily murder. It might be manslaughter or justifiable homicide. &#8216;Of which of these then am I guilty?&#8217; he queried. I could not say because I had never seen the Jones family, but I hear Jones has become a great bore in the asylum by his unceasing appeals to every one to tell him whether he has committed murder, manslaughter, or justifiable homicide!
