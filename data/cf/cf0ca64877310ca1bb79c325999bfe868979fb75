Unlike other Apple devices, the original Vision Pro with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip is <em>not</em> available for trade-in.<br/>

The original Vision Pro with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip launched in February 2024 and was discontinued upon the announcement of a new version with the M5 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">earlier today</a>. Most high-end Apple devices, such as the Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac, become available for trade-in upon the release of a new model, allowing users to fund the purchase of the latest device while getting rid of their old one.<br/>
<br/>
The absence of the Vision Pro from Apple's trade-in program is therefore peculiar, but likely reflects an unwillingness on the behalf of trade-in partners to accept it for now. Users of the original Vision Pro who want to upgrade to the new M5 version will need to sell their old device independently.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-trade-in/">Apple Trade-In</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/discontinued-m2-vision-pro-not-available-for-trade-in/">Discontinued M2 Vision Pro Not Available for Trade-In</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/discontinued-m2-vision-pro-not-available-for-trade-in.2469178/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
