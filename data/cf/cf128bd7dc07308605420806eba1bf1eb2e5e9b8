<p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum publicly ruled out allowing U.S. military strikes on Mexican soil, saying Mexico will accept intelligence cooperation but not foreign operations, and stressing national sovereignty. Her statement came after U.S. President Trump reiterated he was willing to &quot;do whatever it takes&quot; to stop drugs entering the United States, comments that Mexico says it has repeatedly pushed back on. The exchange has raised diplomatic tensions and prompted Mexican officials to seek clarification through embassies and agencies while insisting that any action against criminal groups be led and carried out by Mexican authorities.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/KRtS3gUFxiBC8pCrJKrHOJ1ZlL0SXGAczPuY1GYlXvGUGY6hEK3tANXZDpmNY6x8zs1N4U3PMa1a8TevKhAhwxr2iMere9ZqNgPxBbqhk_iHFlcJCWr_03qsxMNWaysQt29tbTanzmMwiu4FVVJRr8jodVo' alt='Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum during a public appearance related to security and sovereignty matters' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Cooperation limits: Sheinbaum said Mexico will accept U.S. intelligence support but rejected any on‑the‑ground intervention by a foreign government, insisting Mexican authorities operate within their territory.</li><li>Beach incident: On Monday men arrived by boat at a beach in northeast Mexico and installed signs marking land the U.S. Department of Defense considered restricted; Mexico&#x27;s navy removed the signs, and officials began investigating who placed them.</li><li>U.S. messaging split: The U.S. Embassy in Mexico posted a video on X that included past comments from Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying the U.S. would not take unilateral action, a clarification that contrasts with President Trump&#x27;s repeated public offers of military help.</li><li>Political framing: Spanish analysis characterized Sheinbaum&#x27;s response as a mix of firmness and patience as she pushes back on recurring U.S. intervention proposals while preserving room for cooperation.</li></ul><blockquote>It’s not going to happen - Claudia Sheinbaum</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Claudia Sheinbaum / Mexican government: Sheinbaum said she has told President Trump and U.S. officials that Mexico will collaborate on intelligence but will not accept any intervention by a foreign government, and she said those officials have understood that position.
