Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; first arrived in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/08/apple-announces-tap-to-pay-iphone-feature/">February 2022</a> in the U.S., and allows iPhones to accept payments via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets‌‌‌. All transactions are encrypted, and Apple has no information about what is purchased or the person who made the purchase.<br/>
<br/>
No additional hardware or credit card machine is required‌ to use Tap to Pay on ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌. The feature uses NFC technology to securely authenticate the contactless payments, plus the feature also supports PIN entry, which includes accessibility options.<br/>
<br/>

Tap to Pay on ‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌ requires ‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌ XS or newer models, and works for customers as any normal ‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌ transaction would. Sellers just need to open up the app, register the sale, and present their ‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌ to the buyer, who can then use an appropriate contactless payment method.<br/>
<br/>

Distinct from Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, tap to provision allows users to add a payment card to their digital wallet by simply tapping the card against their phone. This process eliminates the need for manual data entry, making it easier to add cards to digital wallets like Apple Wallet. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/tap-to-pay-on-iphone-coming-to-18-new-countries/">Apple&#039;s Tap to Pay on iPhone and Tap to Provision Features Coming to These 18 New Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-and-tap-to-provision-features-coming-to-these-18-new-countries.2457747/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
