U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/goods-imported-china-are-now-facing-54-tariffs-rate-rcna199401">announced</a> that steep tariffs will be applied to imports from many countries, starting April 9. The tariffs could have a significant impact on Apple, as the company assembles the majority of iPhones in China, and products imported to the U.S. from China will be subject to a 54% tariff.<br/>

iPhone prices could increase by up to 43% in the U.S. due to the tariffs, according to analysts at equity research firm Rosenblatt Securities (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/will-trump-tariffs-make-apple-iphones-more-expensive-2025-04-03/">via <em>Reuters</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
Based on that prediction, the top-of-the-line iPhone 16 Pro Max model with 1TB of storage could rise from &#36;1,599 to nearly &#36;2,300 in the U.S., should Apple actually follow through with raising prices by 43% to offset the cost of tariffs.<br/>
<br/>
At the other end of the iPhone lineup, the most affordable iPhone 16e model would increase from &#36;599 to just over &#36;850 with a 43% price increase.<br/>
<br/>
An iPhone 16 Pro with 256GB of storage could rise from &#36;999 to more than &#36;1,400.<br/>
<br/>
Apple would need to raise its prices by at least 30% on average, in order to offset the tariffs, according to Counterpoint Research's Neil Shah.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to publicly comment on the tariffs, so it is unclear if the company will actually raise prices, or if it will get creative and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/03/kuo-on-how-apple-can-reduce-tariff-impact/">find alternative ways</a> to offset the impact. It is also unclear if iPhone 16 models would increase in price, or if Apple would simply set higher prices on iPhone 17 models from the get-go later this year.<br/>
