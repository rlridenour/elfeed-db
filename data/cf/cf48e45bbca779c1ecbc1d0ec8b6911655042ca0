<h2>Privacy first</h2>
<p>By default, all notes and media are stored on your iPhone, entirely offline.
<br>
<br></p>
<h2>A familiar interface</h2>
<p>Browse your entries chronologically through a familiar micro-blogging-like feed (similar to <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social">Mastodon</a>, or <a href="https://bsky.app">Bluesky</a>).</p>
<p>Save notes or journal entries like you would post to any of these familiar services.</p>
<p>With Journelly, your data is yours and remains fully offline.
<br>
<br></p>
<h2>iCloud syncing (optional)</h2>
<p>While Journelly is offline by default, you may optionally sync with other devices via iCloud.</p>
<p>Some folks have used <a href="https://workingcopy.app">Working Copy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pixelspark/sushitrain">Sushitrain</a>, or <a href="https://mobiussync.com">Möbius Sync</a> to sync though your mileage may vary. As of v1, I can only offer iCloud as the officially supported provider.
<br>
<br></p>
<h2>No lock-in (org plain text)</h2>
<p>Journelly stores your entries as a plain text file, using <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html">org markup</a> to structure things.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html">org markup</a>, no worries. It's just what's under the hood. Journelly offers a familiar interface to interact with your entries.</p>
<p>If you're still curious, this is what the marked up text looks like:</p>

<h2>Markdown is coming, want it sooner?</h2>
<p>Journelly's plain text format isn't surfaced to app users and kept as an implementation detail. While many users are happy to just use the app without thinking of internals, others are keen to poke at its plain text file from their beloved editors. Today, Journelly is powered by <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html">org markup</a>, but it will support Markdown in the future.</p>
<p>Please <a href="mailto:journelly+markdown@xenodium.com?subject=I'm%20interested%20Markdown%20for%20Journelly&amp;body=Just%20want%20to%20register%20my%20interest%20in%20Markdown%20support%20for%20Journelly.">register your interest</a>. The more requests I get, the sooner I'll get Markdown support out the door.
<br>
<br></p>
<h2>Journelly v1 is only the beginning</h2>
<p>I've got lots of wonderful feature requests in the pipeline. While I would have loved to squeeze more features into v1, I really needed to manage scope to be able to make its first launch. Having said that, v1 is only the beginning. I'm looking forward to bringing new features in. Many of them I really want for myself!</p>
<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>I hope you find Journelly frictionless, simple, and intuitive to use. Please let me know if there are ways it can improve by reaching out through the app's feedback menu.</p>
