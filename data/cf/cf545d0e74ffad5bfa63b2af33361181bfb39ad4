<blockquote>
  <p>Reports of Roku customers seeing video ads automatically play
before they could view the OS’ home screen started appearing
online this week. A Reddit user, for example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1jcuibl/question_about_ads/">posted</a>
yesterday: “I just turned on my Roku and got an ... ad for a
movie, before I got to the regular Roku home screen.” Multiple
apparent users reported seeing an ad for the movie <em>Moana 2</em>.
The ads have a close option, but some users appear to have not
seen it.</p>

<p>When reached for comment, a Roku spokesperson shared a company
statement that confirms that the autoplaying ads are expected
behavior but not a permanent part of Roku OS currently. Instead,
Roku claimed, it was just trying the ad capability out. [...]</p>

<p>“Our recent test is just the latest example, as we explore new
ways to showcase brands and programming while still providing a
delightful and simple user experience.”</p>

<p>What I’d find delightful and simple is disconnecting my Roku box and throwing it out the window.</p>
