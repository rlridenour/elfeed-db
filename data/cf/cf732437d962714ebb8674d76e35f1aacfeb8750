For reasons of internal review but also for the benefit of the community, at work I&rsquo;ve started recording and making public some of our work meetings, where we build web applications using a full-stack Clojure setup derived (years ago) from Luminus. Several of our team members are brand new to Clojure, so we deal with lots of basics. Questions are welcome!
