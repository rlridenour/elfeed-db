<p>The above links to an Instagram reel with Colbert breaking the news at the start of his show airing tonight. Here’s <a href="https://twitter.com/latenightercom/status/1945993251938549803">the same clip on X</a>, if you prefer. He, apparently, was as surprised as anyone.</p>

<p><a href="https://latenighter.com/news/cbs-cancels-the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-show-to-end-in-may-2026/">Here’s Jed Rosenzweig’s story at (the excellent) LateNighter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em> will end its historic run in
May 2026 at the end of the broadcast season,” the network said in
a statement. “We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will
retire <em>The Late Show</em> franchise at that time. We are proud that
Stephen called CBS home. He and the broadcast will be remembered
in the pantheon of greats that graced late night television.”</p>

<p>The statement was issued jointly by George Cheeks (Co-CEO of
Paramount Global and President and CEO of CBS), Amy Reisenbach
(President of CBS Entertainment), and David Stapf (President of
CBS Studios).</p>

<p>CBS emphasized that the decision was not related to performance or
content: “This is purely a financial decision against a
challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way
to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at
Paramount.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This stinks to high hell. Colbert has the best ratings in late night TV.</p>
