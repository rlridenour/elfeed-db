<p>President Trump announced he has instructed the U.S. Defense Department to immediately resume testing U.S. nuclear weapons, saying the move is needed to match Russian and Chinese programmes; he posted the instruction on Truth Social just before meeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea . The statement follows recent Russian announcements about tests of new systems including a nuclear-powered underwater drone and a cruise missile, which U.S. and international reporting said contributed to Washington&#x27;s decision . U.S. news outlets note the United States last carried out a nuclear explosive test in 1992, and reporting also emphasises uncertainty about whether the president meant underground explosive tests or flight/exercise tests of nuclear-capable delivery systems . Analysts and commentators quoted in coverage warn the move could be seen as an assertion of U.S. strategic power and could raise global arms-race concerns .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/jhK-BgguyIHxLOxrHwOLef2_i1WrmR93KCD3BQYJjNhZXg1N2XkIraO3PxeBxzxDUDAc9lsKuOpmtaj3YWoqZ9ODsJUuTCfqGNyPytIwOGn8' alt='US President Donald Trump speaks during a state dinner hosted by South Korea’s president in Gyeongju on October 29, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Legal background: The U.S. halted live nuclear explosive testing in 1992 under a congressional moratorium and policy practice, making any resumption a major legal and political shift .</li><li>What testing shows: Live tests historically yield technical data on yields and weapon reliability and can confirm whether older warheads still function as expected, which is why militaries value them .</li><li>Allied hardware note: Separately, reporting said President Trump publicly backed deployment decisions including support for a South Korean nuclear submarine, signalling broader shifts in regional deterrence discussions .</li><li>Arms‑race concern: Commentators and analysts warned that recent Russian test announcements and a U.S. resumption could intensify strategic competition and revive nuclear-arms race dynamics .</li><li>Messaging style: The president conveyed the instruction on Truth Social and used the phrase &#x27;Department of War&#x27; in his post, language many outlets highlighted as notable wording .</li></ul><blockquote>Because of other countries testing programmes, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.
