The upcoming iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a significantly upgraded Telephoto camera, according to a <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/PFNemwCv0">post this week</a> from Instant Digital, an account with nearly 1.5 million followers on Chinese social media platform Weibo.<br/>

In fact, the leaker said the iPhone 17 Pro Max will have one of the best Telephoto cameras on any smartphone, but they did not elaborate.<br/>
<br/>
More recent rumors have indicated that both the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/both-iphone-17-pro-models-three-48mp-cameras/">feature an upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto camera</a>. Last year, however, well-connected Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo did suggest the 48-megapixel Telephoto camera <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/">might be exclusive to the iPhone 17 Pro Max</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Whether it is on the Pro and/or Pro Max, the upgraded Telephoto camera is rumored to offer up to 8× optical zoom. Specifically, it has been rumored that the lens will be able to move, allowing for multiple focal lengths. As a result, a tipster claimed that it will be possible to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/29/iphone-17-pro-8x-zoom-theory/">switch between 5× and 8× optical zoom</a>, without tricks like sensor cropping. A moving Telephoto lens would require more parts and internal space, which could explain why the camera bump is expected to be larger on iPhone 17 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
On the iPhone 16 Pro models, the 12-megapixel Telephoto lens has a fixed focal length of 120mm, and it offers a 5× optical zoom option. Apple says the devices also have a 2× optical zoom option, but that uses the main rear camera with sensor cropping, which in simple terms is a technique that effectively zooms in on the center of a larger photo.<br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital has accurately leaked Apple information before, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">Yellow finish for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-introduce-redesigned-milanese-loop/">Apple Watch Ultra 2's Titanium Milanese Loop</a>. However, the account does not have a perfect track record.<br/>
