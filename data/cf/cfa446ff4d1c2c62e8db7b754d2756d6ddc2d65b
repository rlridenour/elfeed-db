<p>&#8220;Is now the time to be a hero?&#8221;<span id="more-54090"></span></p>
<p>The Trump administration&#8217;s brazen interferences with academic freedom and university governance, its punishment of students for exercising their freedom of expression, its drastic cutting of research funding and financial aid, and its attempts to block international students from studying in the US, taken together, constitute an unprecedented attack on higher education.</p>
<p>What are you going to do about it? What should you do about it? What&#8217;s at stake is important, but speaking out or taking action in response to this attack, or to other moves and policies of the current government, may be dangerous. Heroes stand up for values even when doing so is risky. Is now the time for you to be hero? And what does heroism in this context look like?</p>
<p>In the following guest post, <a href="https://www.elizabethharman.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Elizabeth Harman</strong></a>, professor in the Department of Philosophy and Center for Human Values at Princeton University, takes up these and related questions.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">When To Be a Hero<br />
<em><strong>by Elizabeth Harman</strong></em></h2>
<p>Is now the time to be a hero? In this post, I’ll introduce this question and ask for your help in answering it.</p>
<p>Graham Parsons <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/west-point-trump-military.html">resigned</a> from his job teaching at West Point after thirteen years, because they revoked academic freedom in the classroom. I don’t believe he had another job lined up as he resigned. There was something important at stake, and he took a stand. Hero.</p>
<p>Cynthia Stark <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/05/19/how-i-lost-faith-my-universitys-mission-opinion">wrote</a> publicly about bad changes at University of Utah, no doubt angering the university administration and likely fostering their hostility toward herself and her department. But it was important to say what she said. Stark lost less than Parsons in what she did, but still I say: hero.</p>
<p>It might seem that we can figure out whether now is the time to be a hero by figuring out what morality requires us to do. Are we morally required to be heroes now? Does morality demand that we take a stand at significant cost to ourselves? (Sometimes it does.) This is a harder question now than sometimes. As the United States falls apart, as essential government services and excellent government programs are dismantled, as our checks against corruption are eliminated, as our checks and balances are strained, this is truly a moment that heroism might be demanded of us.</p>
<p>If ICE showed up at your office door and asked you to list every “anti-American” or “anti-Israel” comment you’d ever heard an international student make, you’d be morally required to say nothing. Morality would demand that small act of heroism.</p>
<p>But a lot of heroism isn’t like that. Many of us right now are not morally required to be heroic in opposing the actions of our government. So what does that mean for us? Even after realizing that we don’t <em>have </em>to be heroic, that we wouldn’t be acting <em>wrongly </em>to fail to be heroic, there remains the question of <em>whether </em>to be heroic, and in particular the question of whether at this time we <em>should </em>be heroic. Is now the time to be a hero? It may be. It may be that this particular heroic act before you is <em>the thing to do</em>, in light of all the reasons that face you, even though morality doesn’t demand it and you wouldn’t be violating any duties in failing to do it. “I don’t have to do this, but I should,” is a thought worth entertaining, worth taking seriously. It might apply to you right now.</p>
<p>(My book in progress, <a href="https://www.elizabethharman.org/research#/when-to-be-a-hero/"><em>When To Be a Hero</em></a>, argues that sometimes one should do something above and beyond what morality requires, although one doesn’t have to do it and one wouldn’t be doing anything morally wrong in failing to do it.)</p>
<p>As the Federal government aimed its sights on universities, first targeting Columbia, other universities faced choices about how to act. Christopher Eisgruber, the President of Princeton University (where I teach), chose to take a bold stance, publishing an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/columbia-academic-freedom/682088/">essay</a> in <em>The Atlantic </em>calling out the government actions as deeply wrongheaded and unjustified. Taking a bold and early stance was not morally required, but what Chris did was both heroic and, I think, it was <em>the thing to do</em>. Chris didn’t just do a <em>good thing</em> that was worth doing. In light of the reasons that confronted him, Chris did what he should have done. Was now the time for Chris to be a hero? It was, and he saw that&#8212;in a way few other university presidents seemed to.</p>
<p>(Fortunately, since that moment, other universities have stood more firmly in opposition to the Federal government’s efforts. Harvard has refused to be coerced into giving up their independence. Columbia has walked back some of their concessions.)</p>
<p>What are the things we <em>should </em>be doing right now, even if we don’t <em>have to </em>be doing them? This is always a hard question, but in our current moment it is particularly hard for two reasons: our Federal government is acting in unprecedentedly awful ways, and there is a lot of uncertainty about what our situation really is and what differences we are in a position to make.</p>
<p>One question many of us are asking ourselves is <em>How much of a crisis is this? </em>Is fascism taking hold in the U.S.? Is democracy failing? Are we aiding a genocide in Gaza? Is antisemitism dangerously rising in the U.S.? And if this is more of a crisis than many of us have seen before, how differently should we be living our lives? When it’s uncertain both what situation we are in and what we can do about it, what should we do?</p>
<p>The uncertainties and surprises in our situation have made accidental heroes of some people&#8212;or have accidentally magnified the heroism of their actions. I’m thinking particularly of U.S. Green Card holders who spoke out against Israel’s slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza, during last Spring’s campus protests. Put your mind back to one year ago. People who were in the U.S. on visas were aware of their precarious situations; they knew at least that it was dangerous to get arrested. But people who held Green Cards felt secure&#8212;certainly secure in their entitlement to speak their minds. Fast forward to now, and a visa has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tufts-says-international-student-taken-into-us-custody-visa-revoked-2025-03-26/">revoked</a> over an opinion piece in a campus newspaper, a Green Card has been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/11/nx-s1-5360605/mahmoud-khalil-gaza-protests-columbia-university-immigrant">revoked</a> over leading a campus protest. When one turns out to have risked more than one knew, one’s action was more heroic than one realized.</p>
<p>Not knowing what we can do to help, to preserve our democracy, to keep our students safe, might be paralyzing if we are not careful. We might mistakenly think that action is only valuable if it makes a positive difference. I want to share three of my own thoughts about this.</p>
<p>First: Saying the truth about what is going on is always worth doing, even when we don’t know whether it will help and even when there is some reason to think it could hurt. We should say the truth; it is worth spelling out what is happening.</p>
<p>Second: There are strong reasons to join <em>collective action </em>that can make a difference, even if one’s own individual contribution will almost certainly make no difference. This is because there are moral reasons to bring good changes about, even when one does so as one of many joint causes. (Similarly, there are moral reasons against participating in an unjust firing squad, even though one’s individual contribution makes no difference.)</p>
<p>Third: At a time in which horrible, prejudiced, cruel things are being done, and horrible, prejudiced, cruel things are being said, there is a tendency among some of us to close down open discussion and debate&#8212;“this is not the time” to engage with those heinous views. This is a bad and misguided tendency. Shutting down debate within academia&#8212;abandoning robust academic freedom&#8212;is not a good thing to do, so it’s not something we should do. (I’ve written about this is an <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/07/racist-research-princeton-faculty-letter">op-ed</a>, and in an <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ebc5c2582dd0f3baac5e9cc/t/6846ffeeeb8ecc5a3180b11f/1749483503154/Racism+Naming+Racism+and+Academic+Freedom+Published+version+with+footnotes.pdf">essay</a> in the book <em>Academic Ethics Today</em>, ed. Cahn.) Some say that because the stakes are high, we can’t afford to tolerate awful views. But rather, it’s because the stakes are high that we need serious conversation about these issues.</p>
<p>As the Federal government announces its intention to block Harvard from enrolling international students, what can we U.S. professors do for our own international students? I spoke with a Princeton administrator about this last week and we expressed our shared feelings of being at a loss. We can’t offer reassurance to our students. We have none to offer. Can we imagine our university without its international students? We cannot.</p>
<p>When things are happening, or threatening to happen, that are hard for us to imagine, this poses a real danger to us. If we don’t get our minds around what’s happening, we won’t meet the moment.</p>
<p>What heroism are you witnessing in academia these days? What morally good actions are you seeing people take that they don’t have to take? This post has been about U.S. academics, but I would welcome answers about academics anywhere. What heroism (and morally good action more broadly) do you wish you were seeing? What should <em>you</em> be doing? What should the rest of us in academia be doing?</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/06/10/when-to-be-a-hero-guest-post/">When to Be a Hero (guest post)</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
