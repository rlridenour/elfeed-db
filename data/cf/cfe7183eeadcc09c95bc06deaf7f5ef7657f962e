<p>Followers,</p>
<p>It has come to my attention that a major news outlet has plans to run a story concerning my recent memoir, <em>Journeying Through Hell on Foot: A Tale of Survival</em>.</p>
<p>Specifically, they plan to highlight a few minor exaggerations I made throughout the narrative in the name of building dramatic tension. But while this publication plans to paint me as a pathological liar, I can assure you, I never meant to mislead you, my loyal readers.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m getting out in front of this and providing some explanation.</p>
<p>First of all, I said I found myself on a ‘winding, desolate path far from civilization.’ Which, if you think about it, technically could describe certain stretches of Interstate 80. As for the ‘on foot’ bit, well, last time I checked, you push the gas pedal with your foot. Also, I used cruise control a lot, so my feet were firmly planted on the ground. (By which I mean, the floor of my Toyota Corolla.)</p>
<p>Another claim the author of the article apparently sought to paint as a fib was the extensive scene when, severely dehydrated, I stumbled into a meadow filled with dangerous wildlife. To be clear: I was, in fact, dehydrated. I did not mention that said dehydration was brought about by eating a bag of Bugles (so salty!) as I drove, because it did not seem pertinent to the story.</p>
<p>And sure, the meadow may have contained a rest stop. But there were many squirrels in the trees around the picnic area, clucking and angrily whipping their tails. Also, a dog taking a potty break slipped its collar at one point, and for that minute, it was <em>very</em> wild. And dangerous. Trust me. Based on most metrics that don’t rely too heavily on bite-related hospital statistics, dachshunds are considered one of the most aggressive breeds.</p>
<p>As for the unlikely water source I discovered in this place, the one that I only felt safe drinking from due to my LifeStraw bottle capable of filtering out 99.999999% of bacteria and 99.999% of parasites? It may have been a water fountain. But it was pretty gross. And the night I spent shivering in the frigid wind? Perhaps I was in a room at a Motel 6 with an overzealous air conditioner that simply wouldn’t turn off. (The other sketchy water source I mentioned in the book was the sink in that room; the water that came out of it tasted nasty! Very sulfurous! I’m so glad I had my LifeStraw!)</p>
<p>You see? I am not a con artist, as this major news outlet will claim. I’m just a misunderstood author who perhaps applied a slight bit too much artistic license. Is that a crime?</p>
<p>I will strive for more transparency moving forward. And I will be entirely transparent when I say this: refunds for my book will, unfortunately, not be accepted.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
