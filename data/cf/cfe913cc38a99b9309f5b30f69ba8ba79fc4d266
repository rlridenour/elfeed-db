  <p>I’ve released a small PCalc 4.11.1 update that’s out now for
the Mac.</p>

<p>There was a bug with the theme getting reset, which I <em>could</em> have
fixed in five minutes, but I ended up doing what I should have
done over three decades ago, and added a dedicated section to the
settings that puts all the visual customisation in one place.</p>

<p>No more having to search for all this stuff in a submenu
somewhere!</p>

<p>After <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/28/nisus-writer-kissell">the glum news</a> this week regarding Nisus Writer, it feels good to link to a <a href="https://pcalc.com/mac/thirty.html">similarly-aged</a> Mac app that’s still thriving. If you’ve never tried PCalc, <a href="https://pcalc.com/store/pcalcmac">you’re missing out</a>.</p>
