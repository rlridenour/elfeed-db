As most of you know, I&rsquo;m—if not exactly a mac-head—an Apple user for most of my computing needs. I like the way the way all my devices interoperate and can share data, and, of course, I like—require—that it provides me with a Unix environment. I even, sort of, like the way Apple animates certain aspects of its UI.

What to make <a href="https://cindori.com/backdrop">of this</a> then? On the one hand, it looks pretty cool but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d like to have all that superfluous motion in my day-to-day work environment. It seems to me that it would be distracting.

Apple does something like this on the Tahoe lockscreen, which is fine and not distracting but when I&rsquo;m actually coding or writing, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I could do without the distraction.

Of course, I&rsquo;m old and crotchety so maybe you feel differently. What do you Irreal readers think? Is this something you&rsquo;d want on your system or do you agree with me that it&rsquo;s more likely to be annoying noise?</p>
