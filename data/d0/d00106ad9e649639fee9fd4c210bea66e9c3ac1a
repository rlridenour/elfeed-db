         <p>In this ~2-hour video, I talk with Ovidiu “Ovi” Stoica about
programming in Clojure and using it for business, the use of Emacs,
and various topics related to AI.</p>

<p>About Clojure, I ask Ovi what the language is good for and which sort
of business/project benefits from it. He explained at length the
strengths of the language, such as its immutability and asynchronous
operations. Clojure is commonly used in tandem with Datomic, a
transactional database that helps in a number of advanced use-cases
that Ovi covers. In this context, I also learn about Ovi’s own
business, ShipClojure (link below), which helps programmers get
started with a full Clojure stack.</p>

<p>On the topic of Emacs, Ovi tells me about the false starts he had
while trying to use this program. Eventually he got it to work and has
been using it for most tasks, including programming in Clojure and
working with AI tools.</p>

<p>Our exchange about AI covers some of the potential downsides of
relying on the tools on offer. We discuss the nuances involved and how
it still makes sense to become an expert in a given field, even if
there is ongoing talk about AI taking over in the near future. We also
talk about Simuflow (link below), Ovi’s own project to connect AI
agents that deal with speech recognition, audio processing, and
various services. It is open source and written in Clojure.</p>

<h2>About “Prot Asks”</h2>

<p>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More here:
