<blockquote>
  <p>Private AI Compute is built on a multi-layered system that is
designed from the ground up around core security and privacy
principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>One integrated Google tech stack:</em> Private AI Compute runs on
one seamless Google stack powered by our own custom Tensor
Processing Units (TPUs). World-class privacy and security is
integrated into this architecture with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/titanium-underpins-googles-workload-optimized-infrastructure?e=48754805">Titanium</a>
Intelligence Enclaves (TIE). This design enables Google AI
features to use our most capable and intelligent <a href="https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/">Gemini models
in the cloud</a>, with our high standards for privacy and the
same in-house computing infrastructure you already rely on for
Gmail and Search.</li>
<li><em>No access:</em> Remote attestation and encryption are used to
connect your device to the hardware-secured sealed cloud
environment, allowing Gemini models to securely process your
data within a specialized, protected space. This ensures
sensitive data processed by Private AI Compute remains
accessible only to you and no one else, not even Google.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds a lot like Apple’s <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/">Private Cloud Compute</a>, which raises the question of whether this Google project is related to the Gurman scoop that Apple and Google <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/03/gurman-siri-gemini">are on the cusp of a deal</a> for a white-label version of Google Gemini to run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers to power the next-generation versions of Siri and Apple Intelligence.</p>

<p>I strongly suspect this is something Google has been working on for a while. Apple, I think it’s fair to say, places a higher priority on privacy than does Google, but Google does value privacy. But perhaps the deal with Apple accelerated the project within Google.</p>
