<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/wellesley.edu/helenadebres/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helena de Bres</a> is professor of philosophy at Wellesley College. In the following guest post, she talks about the connections and disconnections between humor and philosophy. It&#8217;s a topic she&#8217;s in a good position to discuss, being the rare (only?) philosopher to have written for both <i>The Journal of Moral Philosophy </i>and <em>McSweeney&#8217;s</em>.</p>
<p>The subject of Professor de Bres&#8217; academic work has ranged from the highly global (distributive justice and international trade) to the highly personal (narrative, meaning in life, memoir, family). She is the author of the books <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo90869083.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Artful Truths: the Philosophy of Memoir</em></a> and <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/how-to-be-multiple-9781639730346/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>How to Be Multiple: the Philosophy of Twins</em></a>, and she is currently writing a book on &#8220;philosophy in the first person.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also collecting philosophical jokes, and encourages you to share some in the comments.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">On Being Seriously Funny<br />
<strong><em>by Helena de Bres<br />
</em></strong></h2>
<p>When I told my parents I was considering taking a philosophy class in my first year of college, my father visibly shuddered. There may have been several reasons for this (I mean, god, take your pick), but a frontrunner would’ve been my jokey dad’s distaste for excessive gravity. You could get away with a lot in my childhood home&#8212;in particular, some extremely bad puns&#8212;but one thing you couldn’t indulge in for long was the sin of being earnest.</p>
<p>I share this prejudice and the companion love of the comic and it’s part of why academic philosophy has been a tricky fit for me. Philosophers can be very earnest, not least about the funny. “Don’t laugh much, or at many things, or without restraint,” Epictetus advised. Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, and the medieval scholastics considered humor some combination of foolish, nasty, dangerous, truth-obscuring, impious and low-class. Though this is all rather humorless, I get it. Much comedy has an anti-rational quality: it replaces coherent meaning, logic and linearity with ambiguity, contradiction, and non-sequiturs, shooting for the surreal and absurd. It can also be silly and flippant. For those of us on Team Reason-and-Depth, it can feel like a personal attack.</p>
<p>Throughout grad school I didn’t feel grave enough for the solemn endeavor I was engaged in. I couldn’t get through a class or talk without cracking a joke, either aloud or internally, the latter followed by a herculean effort to avoid sniggering in public about nothing. I didn’t do myself any favors by organizing a joke-filled department <a href="https://web.mit.edu/iap/www/iap06/searchiap/iap-6757.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trivia competition</a> and creating a <a href="https://sites.google.com/wellesley.edu/the-pink-guide-to-philosophy/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide</a> for my students starring an invertebrate teaching assistant called “Philosa Flea.” (Guys, I’m sorry.) I felt pretty alienated, but most of the time it wasn’t an alienation I wanted to fix. I found my apparent lack of fit lonely but also amusing. I once had lunch with a fellow grad student who dismissively referred to someone else in the profession as “not serious” and I immediately wanted to meet them.</p>
<p>Maybe none of this was out of order. Some distinguished philosophers (including several in my grad school department) have been funny on purpose and/or spent a lot of time being amused&#8212;Democritus, Diogenes, Socrates, Montaigne, Voltaire, Wittgenstein, Austin, Nozick, Nagel and (Judy) Thomson spring to mind. According to Plutarch, Crates “passed his whole life jesting and laughing, as though on perpetual holiday.” And, in contrast to the dour admonitions I mentioned earlier, we have commendations of the comic, and of taking it seriously, from several of the greats, including Spinoza, Shaftesbury, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Santayana. They praise humor, variously, for being a core personal and social virtue, a route to the truth, a subversive philosophical teaching tool, a fitting response to the human condition, and a route to salvation. Zarathrustra’s enemy is the Spirit of Gravity, which you kill by laughing.</p>

<p>Coming from the other side, humorists tend to philosophize. A signature move of the disgraced-but-undeniably-funny Woody Allen&#8212;a college philosophy major&#8212;is to raise an existential issue, then sink bathetically to the mundane. (“Not only is there no God, but try getting a plumber on weekends.”) The standard set-up for stand-up comedians is to introduce some puzzling or awkward feature of human behavior, examine it from several angles, propose hypotheses and introduce counter-points, much as we in philosophy do. The key difference between us and them is that they bow out of the questioning relatively quickly in a string of wisecracks, whereas academic philosophers do not bow out. Ever. There’s a scene in Elif Batuman’s hilarious essay collection <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Possessed-Adventures-Russian-Books-People/dp/0374532184?crid=1NMCF9CP1N34H&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.lQdilhyrJ8j7NxiTUknh-zrODlkteqn1KsJDCQf07uQ98wmBa3Cy94ZmzDZOiE-WrMxBgBtXr1OP-0CgBU4Fx97L6lyQ-UPDwC5xMec1hyQ-oXJ1F2-SJBj8M5esKmqkFjruRUQXH0ig6YhsuZOIjw.O53floXCfTqOC66_VYN5HBezR_Z2ZVagG2y1F_TrkEQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=the+possessed+elif+batuman&amp;qid=1753125698&amp;sprefix=The+Possessed%2Caps%2C118&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dainou-20&amp;linkId=e934feda35b18810198e542a3af5d8d8&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Possessed </em></a>where a group of academics are visiting Chekhov’s house. The guide asks if they’d like a quick viewing or the full tour. “&#8217;We want the full tour,&#8217;” the professor-in-charge says, “grimly.”</p>
<p>I joined the grim tour out of necessity leading up to tenure, then wheels began to fall off. I started publishing <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/authors/helena-de-bres" target="_blank" rel="noopener">humor pieces</a> and comic personal <a href="https://coloradoreview.colostate.edu/features/elevation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">essays</a>, wrote a <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/how-to-be-multiple-9781639730346/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book</a> about the philosophy of twins (slapstick, obviously), and publicly diagnosed all my colleagues as <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/is-philosophy-absurd-only-when-youre-doing-it-right" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absurd</a>. For a while I interpreted this as me quiet-quitting the field. But now, further along in the dialectic&#8212;Hegel’s semi-indecipherable <em>Phenomenology of Spirit </em>has been called a comedy, which is funny&#8212;I’m starting to see the whole trajectory as fitting together.</p>
<p>Let me get unserious/serious here and say I got into philosophy at least partly because it was comic and that’s still much of what I enjoy about it. Philosophy is a perfect fit for the most popular philosophical account of humor, the incongruity theory, according to which funniness arises from discrepancy: say, a shift from one meaning to another, or from the high to the low. Philosophy perpetually engages with the high (or, equivalently, the deep), but we philosophers are all too human to stay up there permanently, so we’re constantly caught in this slippage and tumble. In our discipline’s founding act of slapstick, Thales fell into a well because he was too busy staring at the sky, but the rest of us do it less conspicuously every weekday by, for instance, lecturing on Kant’s metaphysics with lines of chalk dust across our asses.</p>
<p>Another way philosophy is comic is that it shares many of the core features of comedy, as I touched on earlier. Both comedy and philosophy take aim at big human questions from a semi-detached standpoint, incorporating what Bergson called “a momentary anesthesia of the heart.” They operate via abstraction, defamiliarization and hypothetical reasoning, and pay obsessive attention to logic and language. They treat nothing as sacred, shoot for truth and have a radical bent. They often end with a neat resolution: the intellectual pleasure of getting a joke is somewhat like that of a getting an argument, or, more generally, the point.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, let me get to it. I want to say that these surface similarities between the philosophical and the comic are grounded in three deep affinities. Humor can be, first, a way of seriously philosophizing, including about philosophy itself. Making fun of philosophy, as comedians do directly or indirectly, and as some of us do from inside the temple, brings to light the inherently incongruous nature of philosophizing, which is funny, but it also casts some healthy doubt on the exalted place accorded to reason and reasoners in the Western tradition. In his recent history of Oxford philosophy, Nikhil Krishnan writes: “Jokiness stands in one sense against seriousness; in another, it represents only a rejection of the characteristic <em>postures </em>of seriousness, of which humourlessness is surely the most obvious.”</p>
<p>Second, when generalized into an overall orientation toward reality, humor can itself be a philosophy. A comic attitude is the closest thing that those of us in the analytic tradition&#8212;who tend to eschew overarching cosmic takes&#8212;may have to a comprehensive philosophy of life. (Or, if it isn’t the only option for us, it’s the most fun.)</p>
<p>Third, when worked up in that way, humor can perform one of philosophy’s traditional roles as a form of existential consolation. Viewing our dire condition from a comic perspective takes some of the edge off it and can be a route to empathy, self-compassion and peace. As a meme I saw recently put it: “’I don’t know how you can joke around at a time like this.’ ‘Sir, that dark sense of humor is a load-bearing structure.’” Some of the things I have joked about in life would make a Stoic weep.</p>
<p>These philosophical benefits of humor&#8212;which, to be clear, don’t exhaust its value&#8212;are at their most transparent in jokes about death. (To quote Allen again: “I don’t want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen; I want to live on in my apartment.”) In its deft levity, a good funereal witticism exerts a momentary advance triumph over one’s messy and grave defeat. The fix is partial, yes, but how else are we going to do it? Via our treatises? LOL!</p>
<p>When considering the best possible deaths, I’ve always thought it’s obviously either die at sea, like Shelley, or die laughing at one’s own joke, like our colleague Chrysippus. The first is serious, the second farcical; in the act of summing up, crowning and farewelling life, you ideally want both. So maybe you’d start by chuckling at sea and then accidentally drown, or die jesting about how you nearly just drowned as you (don’t) recover on the beach. Haha? Okay, not yet. As with our existential situation, I’ll work on it.</p>
