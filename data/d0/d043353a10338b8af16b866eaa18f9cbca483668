<p>While not every Open Culture reader dreams of moving to Japan and becoming a woodblock printmaker, it’s a safe bet that at least a few of you entertain just such a fantasy from time to time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bull_(craftsman)">David Bull</a>, a British-Born Canadian who got his first exposure to the art of <em>ukiyo‑e</em> in his late twenties, actually did it. Though he’s been living in Japan and steadily pursuing his art there since 1986, only in recent years has he become known around the world. That’s thanks to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@seseragistudio">YouTube channel</a>, which we’ve featured here several times before. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGnd5w_a2q8">the video above</a>, one of his most popular, he lets his viewers experience printmaking from his point of view, seeing what he sees and even hearing what he hears.</p>
<p>Though Bull normally focuses on the early stage carving images into the blocks, here he spends about an hour on the final printing phase, going through a batch of eight sheets. As even a few minutes’ viewing reveals, this is a labor-intensive and thoroughly analog process.</p>

<p>That impression will be heightened if you wear headphones, since, as Bull explains, he shot the video while wearing in-ear microphones that record the sounds of the job just as he hears them. This particular aspect of the production required him to rise considerably earlier than usual, in order to avoid the considerable daytime noise on the streets of Tokyo right outside his workshop — and thus to more fully satisfy the large ASMR crowd.</p>
<p>The term ASMR, or “Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response,” refers to a set of pleasing sensations triggered by certain kinds of sound, often those produced by soft-spoken individuals like Bull or the kind of repetitive, methodical tool work he does. Chances are, many if not most of the almost 950,000 views this video has racked up so far have come from ASMR enthusiasts less interested in Japanese woodblock printing per se than in the general aesthetic experience of watching and listening to Japanese woodblock printing — at least at first. We all know how life can go: one day you’re checking out YouTube, just looking to relax, and the next you’re ensconced in Asakusa, having wholly devoted yourself to a three-and-a-half-millennium-year-old traditional art form.</p>
