<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer criticized President Trump’s remarks suggesting NATO allies stayed “a little off the front lines” in Afghanistan, saying the comments were insulting and hurtful to families of British troops who served and died. Starmer said that if he had misspoken in that way, he would apologize—signaling a push to defend allied contributions while keeping the broader US-UK relationship steady. Prince Harry, who served two tours in Afghanistan, also urged that sacrifices be discussed “truthfully and with respect,” underscoring the sensitivity of how the war is remembered across allied countries.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/3Pp8OtK_vTlG4bu0LqvJbbzTRm6KMywZm1hS5W6V99tLbPA6v-0lYWFip5Wyz07U_Vh32CoeL1-m0LME2f1s6QS0wM75dmZRDgZJfoTy8plLqrN4UvcPw__sxOMsIQFe0j9eK-LQ3BmjfS6xKDs2RhN78Es0S8aL7ikX6us3eAOD6cyFDnr7GGTz9DXxQeslsSuTdukraF_X5fZv0xnbs6Pc9RRRl_8HGxgC3cAIvu4b5op2AvcpfhTPwzE90Y_3cTksqxlIC50TDp79GQ' alt='A British soldier’s coffin at Wellington Barracks in London in 2009, highlighting the UK’s Afghanistan losses.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Where it happened: President Trump made the comments during an interview in Davos, Switzerland, while discussing NATO burden-sharing and allied support.</li><li>UK war role: Britain provided the second-largest contingent among Western forces in Afghanistan, reaching a peak deployment of about 11,000 troops in 2011, according to figures cited in reporting.</li><li>Losses remembered: Reporting cited death tolls over the 20-year conflict of 2,456 U.S. service members and 457 British personnel, a backdrop to why the remarks drew such a strong reaction in the UK.</li><li>Veterans’ response: Prince Harry said he served in Afghanistan, made lifelong friends, and lost friends there, arguing the sacrifices should be spoken about with respect.</li><li>Broader unease: RT reported that some European governments have also felt heightened unease amid renewed attention to President Trump’s statements about Greenland and NATO’s value to the U.S..</li></ul><blockquote>I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling, and I’m not surprised they’ve caused such hurt for the loved ones of those who were killed or injured - Keir Starmer</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>UK government (Keir Starmer): Starmer said the remarks were insulting and appalling and indicated an apology would be appropriate if someone “misspoken” that way.
