After Apple released the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> in 2010, it tested a second-generation model that only had 8GB of storage. AppleDemoYT, known for sourcing rare prototype devices, recently shared a video featuring the test &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; runs SwitchBoard, Apple's internal factory testing software, instead of a version of iOS. It was manufactured in 2011, but it is a 2012 &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that has an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 2,4 identifier. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is a prototype that Apple used during the Engineering Validation Testing phase of device production.<br/>

On the back of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, there's an 8GB label, which suggests it wasn't just meant to be a test device. Apple's original &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; started with 16GB of storage, and Apple never released an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that had less storage space than that.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to the launch of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 3, there were rumors suggesting that Apple would release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2012/02/29/8-gb-ipad-2-coming-alongside-16-gb-and-32-gb-ipad-3-next-week/">low-cost iPad 2 with 8GB storage</a>. It was supposedly going to be a more affordable option, but Apple ended up launching the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 3 at &#36;499, while keeping the 16GB &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 2 around at &#36;399. The 8GB &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; never made it to market.<br/>

The rumor about the 8GB &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; came from <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em>, a site that has a hit or miss record when it comes to Apple rumors. Interestingly, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 2 prototype proves that this is one time that <em>&zwnj;DigiTimes&zwnj;</em> wasn't wrong, because Apple did seemingly consider an 8GB model.<br/>
<br/>
It's likely that Apple decided 8GB wasn't enough storage space for a tablet, and 2012 was around the time that Apple phased out 8GB capacities for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. From the original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4s, 8GB storage was an option, but the 2012 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 started with 16GB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
These days, 128GB is the minimum storage that Apple offers in its iPhones and iPads.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/">Prototypes</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/29/8gb-ipad-prototype/">8GB iPad Prototype from 2011 Reveals Apple&#039;s Scrapped Budget Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/8gb-ipad-prototype-from-2011-reveals-apples-scrapped-budget-model.2467923/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
