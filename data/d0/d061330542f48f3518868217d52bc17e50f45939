Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model will have "worse" battery life compared to previous iPhone models, according to a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles">paywalled <em>The Information</em></a> report.<br/>

In internal testing, Apple determined that the percentage of users who will be able to use the iPhone 17 Air for a full day without needing to recharge the device throughout the day will be between 60% and 70%, according to the report. For other iPhone models, the report said that metric is apparently between 80% and 90%.<br/>
<br/>
The reduced battery life is due in part to the iPhone 17 Air's ultra-thin 5.5mm design, which would make it the thinnest iPhone ever.<br/>
<br/>
To mitigate this problem, the report said that Apple is planning to release a battery case as an optional accessory for the iPhone 17 Air.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last released battery cases <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/20/apple-new-iphone-11-battery-cases/">for the iPhone 11 lineup</a>, followed by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">since-discontinued MagSafe Battery Pack</a> for iPhone 12 models and newer. A battery case both protects an iPhone and provides additional battery life as necessary.<br/>
<br/>
The report added that Apple's supply chain is uncertain about how much demand there will be for the iPhone 17 Air, given it will be an all-new model with a unique form factor. As a result, the suppliers are initially only dedicating about 10% of production capacity for the iPhone 17 series to the iPhone 17 Air, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
The report reiterated that the iPhone 17 Air will have only a single speaker, a single rear camera, and no SIM card slot worldwide.<br/>
