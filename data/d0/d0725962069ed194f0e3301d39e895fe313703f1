When you’re building a side project, chances are you need to collect user events so that you can understand user behaviors better and eventually improve your product.</p>

So recently I made a small ClojureScript library for that, it supports web apps or chrome extensions.
Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/whatacold/google-analytics,">https://github.com/whatacold/google-analytics,</a> it also contains a <a href="https://github.com/whatacold/google-analytics/tree/master/demo">demo project</a> using <a href="https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html">shadow-cljs</a> as the build tool.</p>

Hope it helps, and give it a star ⭐ on GitHub and share it if it does, thanks!</p>
