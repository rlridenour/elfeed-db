<p>Lately, Emacs on my Mac has been crashing more frequently. I don&rsquo;t know for sure what it is, and I can&rsquo;t get much from the logs, but it seems to be somewhat related to images. Perhaps some memory issue.</p>
<p>My research has led me to suspect that perhaps emacs-plus from Homebrew would be better (<a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/03/30/emacs-so-far.html">I&rsquo;ve been using </a><a href="https://emacsformacosx.com">Emacs for macOS</a>), but I&rsquo;m not quite sure yet.</p>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;m too tired to tackle it, so I&rsquo;m going to crawl to bed. I&rsquo;ve been too tired and too busy in the evenings to do much of my personal projects, which sucks. Hope to get some stuff done this weekend, but it&rsquo;s going to be a busy one.</p>
