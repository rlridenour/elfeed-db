<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has filed an emergency motion asking the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals to pause key parts of a recent ruling that dramatically
changes how the App Store operates, following a contempt finding
in its long-running legal battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games.</p>

<p><a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zgvojeggwpd/Apple%20motion%20Epic%20Games%20-%2020250507.pdf">In court documents filed Wednesday</a>, Apple called the district
court’s order “extraordinary” and argued it unlawfully forces the
company to permanently give up control over “core aspects of its
business operations.”</p>

<p>“A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free
access to its products and services, including intellectual
property,” Apple’s lawyers wrote in the motion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s argument here might go along the lines of Ben Thompson’s theory (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/apple-held-in-contempt-the-crux-of-the-case-the-takings-clause/">in a subscriber-only post last Friday</a>) on <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-v/clauses/634">the “Takings Clause” of the 5th Amendment</a>. Thompson wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My use of the word “took” is deliberate, because I am referring to
the Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment (the clause is
emphasized):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise
infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand
Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in
the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public
danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to
be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled
in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
law; <em>nor shall private property be taken for public use, without
just compensation</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that Judge Gonzales Rogers just did exactly that:
her latest ruling basically says that companies like Spotify are
entitled to iOS APIs and App Store distribution without having to
pay Apple anything.</p>

<p>If this sounds like a new addition to the case, it is! The Takings
Clause has not come up in any previous litigation precisely
because Judge Gonzales Rogers’ original opinion acknowledged that
Apple had the right to charge a commission; the issue under the
California Unfair Competition Law was that Apple’s commission was
much higher than was justified precisely because Apple foreclosed
competition. To that end, what would have made much more sense
would have been if Judge Gonzales Rogers lowered Apple’s proposed
27% commission to something significantly lower; to simply wipe it
out completely is what prompts this discussion.</p>
