<p>Immediately few things to mention.</p>
<p>First: we&rsquo;re going to talk about Tabs as in &ldquo;UI element&rdquo;. Not indentation.
<br/>
Second: Tabs in Vim and Emacs are not supposed to be used as tabs in many other editors.</p>
<h2 id="vim-tabs">Vim Tabs</h2>
<p>Vim tabs aren&rsquo;t supposed to be tabs similar to other editors where you have a file per tab and then switch those tabs with your mouse (???!). There are buffers for that.</p>
<p>Vim tabs were designed to hold &ldquo;workspaces&rdquo; or logical group of files/buffers/splits, quickfix windows or other &ldquo;vim ui&rdquo; elements.</p>
<p>For instance you may be working on a project issue and you have your tests in one split and actual code in another. Maybe some docs in 3d one.</p>
<p>Now somebody in your company chat asks for a help and you as a nice person want to take a look.
<br/>
You do <code>:tabnew</code> and new fresh &ldquo;workspace&rdquo; is opened. You then go to a file your colleague was asking for, view it, open one more split for tests or docs, vimgrep for stuff and it&rsquo;s all happening in new fresh &ldquo;workspace&rdquo;. When you&rsquo;re done you just do <code>:tabclose</code> and you&rsquo;re back to you first main workspace with your 3 splits where everything is untouched <strong>which smooths context switching a lot</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="emacs-tabs">Emacs Tabs</h2>
<p>Switching to any editor from Vim I always felt missing Vim-like tabs functionality and I felt the same in Emacs too.
Fortunately starting with Emacs27 we have few tab modes built-in and one of them is <code>tab-bar-mode</code> (default prefix <code>C-x t</code>)</p>
<p>Turns out I can use <code>tab-bar-mode</code> pretty similarly to vim tabs.</p>
<p>The only difference is in Vim when all but one tab is closed the tab-bar gets hidden. Emacs tab-bar dosn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>But fortunately it&rsquo;s Emacs so add this advice to your <code>init.el</code> and now tab-bar gets hidden when there is only one tab left.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In case you don&rsquo;t like how Emacs tabs look or behave you can try <a href="https://depp.brause.cc/eyebrowse/">https://depp.brause.cc/eyebrowse/</a> package that sounds the same to me but its &ldquo;tabs&rdquo; are shown in the modeline.</p>
<p>Its styles probably can be customized but with my theme and modeline there is no way to understand what &ldquo;workspace&rdquo; is currently active.
<br/>
On the other hand tab-bar is also looking pretty bad (which is also customizable).</p>
