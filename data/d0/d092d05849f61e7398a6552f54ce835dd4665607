<h2 id="reason">Reason</h2>
<p>The Adobe Creative Cloud has a set of fantastic tools and is probably the go to for most professional creative lots out there.</p>
<p>However they are mind-bogglingly expensive for normal people who just want to edit their digital creations. Plus the subscription model is still an immense caveat for most people including me. In comes the <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/">Affinity suite</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-applications">The Applications</h2>
<p>It is a set of three applications for creatives. According to the vendor, <a href="https://www.serif.com/en-us/">Serif</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Award-winning creative graphics software</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I am by no means a designer, but I do fairly often need a digital tool for either editing photos, light DTP and graphics for family and friends and other a bunch of other stuff. I have also managed the IT for a bunch of creative agencies using mostly the Adobe tools in the past.</p>
<p>Thus I am reasonably certain that the applications are more than up to the task for the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; user. There is even a serious argument to be made that they are capable for a lot of professional users. I suspect that Adobe&rsquo;s firm grasp is not due to the chops but rather because of the propensity of most to sticking to the old.</p>

<p>Not only is the Affinity suite more able to handle my needs for graphic work at a much lower price, but they do this in style. I find that they fit much more to the design language of macOS.</p>

<p>The workflow is surprisingly similar to the Adobe products – actually down to the layout of the application. Plus there are quite extensive tutorials on <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/learn/">the Affinity sites</a>.</p>

<p>&lt;p style=&ldquo;color:#f7821b;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&ldquo;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;I have not told you the best part yet. It costs as of the writing of this articles roughly 160€ and you keep it permanently in contrast to Adobe&rsquo;s subscription.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have tried to come up with a proper reason for not using these applications instead the Adobe suite if you do not absolutely need it in your job. I could not do it.</p>
<p>It is an entirely different story for many enterprise environments. These tend to have a rigid workflow with the Adobe products deeply integrated in the processes. Changing the tooling here is mostly a costly enterprise.</p>
