While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-debuts-new-ipad-pro-with-m5/">new iPad Pro</a>'s headline feature is the M5 chip, the device has some other changes, including N1 and C1X chips, faster storage speeds, and more.<br/>
<br/>

With the M5 chip, the new iPad Pro has up to a 20% faster CPU and up to a 40% faster GPU compared to the previous model with the M4 chip, according to <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ipad17%2C2">Geekbench 6 results</a>. Keep in mind that 256GB and 512GB configurations have a 9-core CPU, while 1TB and 2TB configurations have a full 10-core CPU.<br/>
<br/>
Here are six other upgrades:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>An increased <strong>12GB of RAM</strong> for models with 256GB or 512GB of storage. 1TB and 2TB configurations still have 16GB of RAM.</li><br/>
<li>Apple's custom <strong>N1 chip</strong> for <strong>Wi-Fi 7</strong> and Bluetooth 6. However, the chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/13/apple-n1-chip-has-wi-fi-7-limitation/">only supports up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth</a> for Wi-Fi 7, short of the standard's 320 MHz maximum. Apple says the chip also improves the overall performance and reliability of features like AirDrop and Personal Hotspot.</li><br/>
<li>Apple's custom <strong>C1X chip</strong> for cellular configurations. With this modem, Apple says the new iPad Pro achieves up to 50% faster cellular data performance than its predecessor, and power efficiency is also improved.</li><br/>
<li>Apple says the new iPad Pro offers <strong>up to 2× faster SSD read and write speeds</strong> compared to the previous generation.</li><br/>
<li>The new iPad Pro can <strong>drive external displays at up to a 120Hz refresh rate</strong>, and Adaptive Sync is now supported, resulting in smoother scrolling and gameplay with lower latency on the external display.</li><br/>
<li>The new iPad Pro <strong>supports fast charging</strong>. Apple says up to a 50% charge can be reached in around 30 minutes for the 11-inch model, and in around 35 minutes for the 13-inch model. Apple has not shared similar figures for previous iPad Pro models, so it is unclear how much of an improvement this is.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/specs/">tech specs</a> also indicate the new iPad Pro can drop down to an ultra-low 1 nit of display brightness, which can be useful in dark environments, like a bedroom at night. Apple's tech specs did not list this ability for previous iPad Pro models.<br/>
