The AirPods Pro were introduced in 2019 as a high-end version of AirPods, offering a new design, touch-sensitive controls, and active noise cancellation (ANC). The second-generation improved ANC and introduced the H2 chip, Precision Finding, and much more. Apple refreshed it with USB-C a year later. This year, Apple debuted the third generation, featuring a new design and heart-rate monitoring. Each generation has added better sound quality and a range of new features.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation AirPods Pro have now been discontinued by Apple, but they can still be found for reduced prices at third-party resellers and second-hand. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to purchase second-generation AirPods Pro for a reduced price or the third-generation version.<br/>
<br/>

Overall, the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; offer a relatively significant upgrade over the previous generation with valuable enhancements across the board, such as better fit, longer battery life, and improved dust and water resistance. Users who heavily use their AirPods Pro may be able to justify upgrading to the third-generation model due to the wide range of improvements, but this will not be the case for all existing users.<br/>
<br/>
Those who recently purchased the AirPods Pro 2 may not be able to justify upgrading to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; at the current time, unless they particularly want features like enhanced ANC and heart-rate monitoring, or hope for a better fit. The AirPods Pro 2 continue to get new features such as Live Translation and share the same chip as the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj;; they are still a solid device in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Users who purchased their AirPods Pro in 2022 or earlier will almost certainly see more of a reason to upgrade, especially if the batteries in their existing device have significantly degraded and they want to transition to USB-C. First-generation AirPods Pro users, in particular, should consider upgrading. These customers will certainly benefit from the plethora of refinements that the third-generation model offers. <br/>
<br/>
If you've been interested in purchasing the AirPods Pro for a while, now is still a good time to pick up the second-generation model for a hefty discount. Likewise, it is worth bearing in mind that the AirPods Pro are among the most-commonly discounted Apple products, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#airpods">check out our Apple Deals Roundup</a> for significant savings.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-pro-2-vs-3/">AirPods Pro 2 vs. AirPods Pro 3 Buyer&#039;s Guide: Should You Upgrade?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-2-vs-airpods-pro-3-buyers-guide-should-you-upgrade.2466401/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
