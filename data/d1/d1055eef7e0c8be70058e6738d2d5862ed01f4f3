Apple plans to change its U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-anti-steering-injunction-violation/">accordance with a ruling</a> from the U.S Northern District of California, Apple said in a statement to <em>MacRumors</em>. The company does plan to appeal the decision, though.<br/>

"We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal," reads Apple's statement.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was found to be in violation of a 2021 injunction that targeted its anti-steering &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules, and the company has been ordered to comply with that injunction immediately. The court has provided instructions on the changes that Apple needs to make.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Apple cannot prevent developers from adding links or buttons that direct customers to make purchases outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple cannot collect any fee or commission for purchases that consumers make outside of an app, nor can it track, audit, or monitor consumer activity.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple cannot control the language, formatting, placement, or style that developers use to direct customers to purchases outside of an app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple cannot interfere with consumers' choice to leave an app with anything other than a neutral message about visiting a third-party site, so no "scare screens."</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple is prohibited from excluding certain categories of apps and developers from obtaining link access.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple cannot prevent developers from using dynamic links that bring consumers to a specific product page in a logged-in state, nor can it prevent apps from providing product details, user details, or other information that refers to the user intending to make a purchase.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
In the order, the court said that it "will not tolerate further delays" and that the ruling is effective immediately, so Apple will need to make these changes imminently.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-rule-change-appeal/">Apple to Comply With New Court Ordered App Store Rules, But Will Appeal</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-comply-with-new-court-ordered-app-store-rules-but-will-appeal.2456269/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
