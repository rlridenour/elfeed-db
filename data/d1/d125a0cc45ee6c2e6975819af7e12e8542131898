<p>Columbia University is &#8220;one of the most premier research and teaching institutions in the world, and that institution dies tomorrow.&#8221;<span id="more-53448"></span></p>

<p>That&#8217;s recently retired Columbia Professor of Law Katherine M. Franke in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/W7Rr7d5Qgco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> she posted online yesterday about the plans of the Trump administration to place Columbia into a consent decree.</p>
<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>A consent decree, which can last for years, would give a federal judge responsibility for ensuring Columbia changes its practices along lines laid out by the federal government. If such a decree is in place, Columbia would have to comply with it. If a judge determines the school is out of compliance, it could be held in contempt of court, punishable by penalties including fines. </em></p>
<p>Franke says she has heard that Columbia will be going along with Trump&#8217;s plans:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>What I am hearing is that tomorrow we will learn that the university has agreed a form of formal oversight and governance by the Trump administration.</em></p>
<p>Last month, the Trump administration withheld $400 million in federal funding from Columbia and demanded it comply with a list of specific changes. At the time, Columbia responded by saying it would indeed comply, but its money has not been restored&#8212;in fact it was hit again last week when <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-freezes-all-research-grants-columbia-university" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIH froze all funding to the university</a>. After Columbia&#8217;s initial response, I <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/03/24/columbia-trump-peril-appeasement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>That such overreach may not have been so bad for Columbia this time around will be no comfort when—the precedent having been set, the power-grab politically normalized—things get worse later for it and other institutions. </em></p>
<p>It turns out later may be much sooner than anyone thought.</p>
<p>Again, the <em>WSJ</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>A consent decree would be a major escalation of how the federal government normally resolves education-related civil-rights issues&#8230;</em></p>
<p class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0" style="padding-left: 40px;" data-type="paragraph"><em>For a consent decree to take effect, Columbia would have to agree to enter it. It is unclear whether the university board has discussed the possibility.</em></p>
<p class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0" style="padding-left: 40px;" data-type="paragraph"><em>Columbia could fight the move in court; the Justice Department would need to prove that the arrangement is warranted. But a court case could take years, and Columbia would likely lose federal funding in the interim—and might ultimately lose. Opposing the move would also open the school up to required depositions and legal fact-finding, which could keep the school’s campus politics in the spotlight.</em></p>
<p>If Franke is correct, the university board will agree (or already has agreed) to the consent decree&#8212;the details of which are not yet available. If you happen to know more, please share it in the comments.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/14/will-columbia-be-taken-over-by-the-federal-government/">Will Columbia Be Taken Over by the Federal Government?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
