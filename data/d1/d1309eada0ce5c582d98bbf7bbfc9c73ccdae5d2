<blockquote>
  <p>Italian tax authorities argue that free user registrations with X,
LinkedIn and Meta platforms should be seen as taxable transactions
as they imply the exchange of a membership account in return for a
user’s personal data.</p>

<p>The issue is especially sensitive given wider trade tensions
between the EU and the administration of U.S. President Donald
Trump. Italy is claiming 887.6 million euros ($1.03 billion) from
Meta, 12.5 million euros from X and around 140 million euros from
LinkedIn. [...]</p>

<p>According to several experts consulted by Reuters, the Italian
approach could affect almost all companies, from airlines to
supermarkets to publishers, who link access to free services on
their sites to users’ acceptance of profiling cookies.</p>

<p>Charging a VAT on free account signups does not strike me as a good idea.</p>
