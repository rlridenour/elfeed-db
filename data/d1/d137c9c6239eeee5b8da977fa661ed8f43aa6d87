<p>The instigator of this post is Tracy Durnell’s <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/04/13/on-hobbies-and-the-difficulty-of-embracing-slowness/">On hobbies and the difficulty of
embracing slowness</a>.  Reading that post, and her references sparked a frenzy in
my mind.  I found myself opening a succession of links, reading and reflecting,
then tumbling to another.</p>
<p>I felt a crescendo building.  Not as an orchestral piece drawing to a close, but
as a wave on Lake Michigan, building and soon to crash upon the shore.  Ideas
shimmering as though a full moon reflecting on the choppy surface.</p>
<p>I saw this wave, not yet cresting, knowing that if I moved into it, and let
myself relax, I could feel its power.  A push towards land, a pull towards the
floor, and a lift towards the heavens.  A powerful embrace of a moment.</p>
<p>Here I felt the paradox of knowing that I needed to bring slowness to a moment
of frenetic discovery.</p>

<p>In late <time datetime="2008-12" title="2008-12">December of 2008</time>, my brother, my children, and I went to Indianapolis to
spend a night and a day at an indoor water park.  But it wasn’t the stay that
was memorable, it was the return.</p>
<p>And only in writing this do some of the memories return: of filling a gas tank
in weather so cold that the pumps hardly worked; of momentary shock of
transitioning from the indoor part of the water slide to the outdoor (though
enclosed) portion; of lounging on a lazy river.</p>
<p>While there we chose to visit some then friends and their new born daughter.  It
wasn’t on our itinerary but the kids were eager to see a baby, me and my brother
to chat with our friends, and it was unlikely we’d be back anytime soon.</p>
<p>This decision created the circumstances of a memory my family holds dear.
Namely being stuck on Interstate 465 for 6 or so hours in an ice storm that set
in so quick that the roads were not adequately treated for the weather; though I
don’t know what would’ve been adequate.</p>
<p>It’s hard to think that being stuck in a mini-van with my brother, and three
children (ages 11, 8 and 6) would be such a positive memory.  But it is.</p>
<p>What we saw on the road was a double jack-knife of semis; one on the eastbound
and one on the westbound.  We waited, as emergency vehicles slipped past on the
shoulder.  We saw their wheels slide and that slight grade for drainage creating
moments in which we thought the emergency vehicle would slide off the shoulder
and into drain field.</p>
<p>The weather was miserable, and we rationed our meager juice boxes and snacks.
We sang songs.  Shared stories.  Relieved ourselves in that drain field.  All
waiting, powerless to do nothing to change our external situation.</p>
<p>Yet inside that van, all of us were able to slow down and be present.  To see
that any bit of motion on that road was likely disastrous.  And when the
response cleared the semi, each of us drivers, bearing witness to horrific road
conditions began an ever so slow effort to move forward.  We eased off our
brakes and let our engines idle us forward; foot by foot.  Avoiding the
precarity of acceleration and vector changes.</p>
<p>The specifics of that memory fade, but the time spent together remains.  The
kids still speak of it, with a sort of fondness.  A remembering of a time of
togetherness; in which it felt simpler.  In which none of us could retreat to
our isolating caverns of our digital devices.</p>
<p>That day on Interstate 465, the slowness of transpiring events sunk deep into
our shared memory.  As though the storm itself was freezing the event and
vignettes that flashes in my mind as I write this post.</p>
<h2 id="the-questing-book">The Questing Book</h2>

<aside  role="note" class="margin">

<p><small>I have several questing books, and keep that list handy when I visit a

<p>For several years, I had been questing for <cite data-id="C2F8BF31-362C-4F0D-A4F2-8F6B1927CB1A">Slowness</cite> by Milan Kundera.  I had
encountered a passage that became a personal strategy:</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="20221009T120451">
<p>
There is a secret bond between slowness and memory, between speed and
forgetting.
</p>

<p>When I want to remember something, I slow down.  Drink it in.  Write about it.
Walk with it.  And when I want to forget, I take fast actions; one of those
being doom scrolling.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> The act of finding a source of “infinite” discrete and scannable concepts
that I can rapidly pass in and out of my field of vision.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>I could’ve solved resolved this quest by ordering online, but instead chose to
wait.  Then one day, at a used book store, I saw a copy for sale.  They wanted
$200.  Not a chance.</p>
<p>My heart sank, as this was my first sighting in the wild.  Was this book really
that rare?</p>
<p>A week later, I found a used copy for $10 or so dollars.  I felt excitement and
elation.  I started and finished reading <cite data-id="C2F8BF31-362C-4F0D-A4F2-8F6B1927CB1A">Slowness</cite> on a <time datetime="2025-02-27" title="2025-02-27">Thursday</time>; finding a
satisfaction in being able to “claim” the epigraph as one I’d encountered in its
native habitat, and the journey through that habitat changed me a bit.</p>
<p>Now recognizing the destructive allure of the motorcycle; of the precarity of
letting excitement overcome purpose and instead present novelty; and the tenuous
stuttering interlacing dance of impulse and self-doubt.  And how our intentions
may be incongruent with our methods.</p>
<p>That passage about the bonds of slowness and memory, and speed and forgetting,
has become my personal mantra.  One I try to remember when I feel things moving
fast or when things are stuck.</p>

<p>I often think of nostalgia, less and less these days pining for it, but instead
acknowledging its allure.</p>
<p>A late friend of mine once traveled to England and asked to see some old stuff.
Starting from an urban center, he’d find a guide that pointed him to something
old.</p>
<p>He’d get there, poke around a bit, and then ask folks at that place for a guide
to something old.  Repeating this, he was pointed to something pre-historic and
hauntingly old, yet known to be human made.</p>
<p>He didn’t settle on the first answer of something old, but kept pressing,
asking.  Until he found a neolithic forge in a remote corner of the British
Isles; a place that left him with a sense of ancient and remembered only in
myth.</p>
<p>He wasn’t looking restore that past, but instead to bath in its faded memories
now projected into our future.  Those moments and spaces in which we know, when
encountered, of something sacred and old.<small class="side-container">

</p>
<p>Yet the past wasn’t a simpler time, it was a slower time; slower relative to our
current lived experiences.  And there is a myriad of slowness; that of times
perception as one ages, of speed of communication and fabrication, of transit.
And that slowness is unevenly distributed.</p>
<p>As I grow older, my birthdays seem to come a sooner and sooner each
year.  I’d imagine my last year of life will look like a flash compared to a
year of mine in adolescence.</p>
<p>Or of communication, the instantaneity of the medium being a factor of how soon
I forget.  Of fast fabrication, leading to impulse buys.</p>
<p>So I wonder, is there a connection to our march into the Anthropocene; shaping
the world in “our image” (which we construe as the image of God), which has
turned our understanding of the world into one of pending death.</p>
<p>We’ve had prophets long saying that the end is nigh.  But the end of what?
Certainly not the earth, nor life in general.  Much like others will go on
living after I die, the earth will go on living after “we” die.</p>

 elections wore off, I started
thinking through history.  There are correlations to Germany, but my hope is
that we can move past this without a war.</p>

<p>I was looking for experiences that would be legible to me: a white settler who’s
ancestors first migrated west to east; from what is now the Netherlands, to
Poland, and then the Ukraine; then reversing direction and immigrating to
Nebraska.</p>
<p>I also wanted to consider that there is a personal illegibility for me of
Indigenous and Black actions.  Some aspects are illegible by design<small class="side-container">

 while
others are an untranslatable element due in part to my having less systemic
commonality to those experiences.  Not that there isn’t something to learn in
those struggles and achievements, but that it may not be as easily applicable.</p>
<p>I’m not discrediting nor ignoring those Indigenous and Black voices, but am
<em>adding</em> to my listening the stories of people closer to my lived reality.  None
of us alone house the answers.</p>
<p>The fundamentals remain: build and strengthen local relationships.  And one idea
I have is to examine and share the differences between our learned and lived
history.  Imagine, each of us sharing memories of past collective hardships, at
present fading from memory.</p>
<p>I’ve encouraged my mom to share and talk with her friends about those they
remember dying from polio, smallpox, measles, and others forgotten.  In part to
spark memories of medical progress that we’ve made, but which is jeopardized.</p>
<p>It is hard to rally around abstractions, as within those abstracts enters
disagreements of specificity.</p>
<p>One of those pathways shared by Tracy lead me to <a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/ksmith3123@gmail.com/2025/02/04/160039.html">aka Ken Smith: We the people of
&lsquo;89</a>; which speaks of Czechoslovakia’s Velvet Revolution.</p>
<p>I recall reading, though cannot remember where, that when asked how
Czechoslovakia so quickly established a successful democracy after the communist
resignation, Václav Havel said something along the lines of: it is because we
had been talking to each other.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-04-14" title="2025-04-14">Today</time> that talking would definitely not be on “social” media platforms.  In part
because those platforms are not designed for the slow; they are for fast
engagement.  Even notifications reminding you to re-engage in something,
distract you from that which just before had your intention.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

<p>Here&rsquo;s my pep talk after studying authoritarianism:</p>
<ol>
<li>They never truly expect a long-term resistance movement because they think
people are a collection of trauma triggers who are easily controlled thru
terror.</li>
<li>If they can&rsquo;t terrorize you 24/7 in your mind, they have already lost the
war.</li>
<li>The single best way you can resist fascism is to not let them terrorize you
constantly.  Protect your mental health to ensure you are not constantly in a
terrorized state</li>
<li>Keep connecting to who you are at your core.  Your values, preferences,
ethics, and beliefs.  Build up capacity to resist</li>
<li>Remember they are like abusive parents: they only see us as extensions of
them.  They have no clue how powerful joy and community and self-expression
can be.  We can use this to our advantage — we can be the strong-willed child
they never saw coming.</li>
</ol>
<p>Spending time connecting to your true self is not selfish in these times — it&rsquo;s
intricately connected to a resistance movement that is tied to honoring our
bodies, our communities, and to the land.  We have to build capacity to resist
by being exactly who we are!</p>


</blockquote>

<p>As I pasted that copy into my blog post, I first re-read Kundera’s aphorism then
read it as though a turtle; moving slowly towards the sandy shore in which I
might lay my clutch of eggs.</p>
<p>First, there’s the “long-term resistance.”  This isn’t a sprint, its not even a
marathon, it’s more akin to a wave on the ocean, moving towards the shore.  The
crashing arrival may be the waves end but the water remains, receding to join
another wave.</p>
<p>I loath the language of Agile, in particular sprints.  Having seen teams adopt
an every two weeks, for two full weeks we will do a chunk of work we call
sprinting.  What, I wonder, is the psychological impact of using that language
for that unending cadence?  How can that mindset not lead way to “Move fast and
break things?”</p>
<p>Or is it a problem (e.g., “we broke things”) being reframed or rationalized with
“but we were moving fast?”</p>
<p>Now consider the “24/7”, at times when I’ve engaged in a “24/7” news cycle, I’ve
found exhaustion and disorientation.  And my earliest memory of that lived
experience was the news cycle on and after <time datetime="2001-09-11" title="2001-09-11">September 11, 2001</time>.</p>
<p>So I consider when I’ve felt ensnared by that 24/7 cycle.  And remember what it
felt like when I cut myself from that net.  There’s a lightness of being.  Of
inspecting my person and seeing if its all there.</p>
<p>Now I look to “Terrorize you constantly”; the adverb is what’s doing the work
“constantly” as in all of the time.  I know at times I’ve felt as though I were
in the terrorizing coil of metaphorical boa constrictor.</p>
<p>And in almost each of those cases, I had chosen to climb amongst those coils.
What I have found is that “being informed” of each “grand/global” moment does
not help me.</p>
<p>Which has me wondering, if I feel a need to be informed (by this 24/7 cycle) how
might I ritualize and make temporary both gazing into the abyss and screaming
into the void?</p>
<p>“Keep connecting to who you are…”  I’ll touch again on that aphorism, I more
easily forget who I am when I’m “going fast.”  When I’m bouncing between
fragments; an electron in a probability cloud of thought; never truly anywhere.</p>
<p>“We can be the strong-willed child they never saw coming.”  Here I think we can
use inverse, namely that there are agents moving fast (and creating a sense of
things happening fast) so perhaps there will be lots of forgetting.</p>
<p>And what is forgotten is that which we have lost sight of.  I find that I must
slow down to remember.  To look back across time along that bending arc and
forward as well.</p>
<p>Extending that analogy and bringing in some relativity, consider that light
bends around gravity wells.<small class="side-container">

</small>
 Those wells of gravity being a density of matter.</p>
<p>How might I bend that arc?  Forgetting is a disintegration of memory: a
formlessness.  In memory and sense of self, I take form.  How might I join
others in forming something that matters?</p>

<p>The mini-van I drove that day in Indianapolis has long been totaled; the result
of an accident a few years later.  But not before we all traveled to Nebraska
for my brother’s wedding.</p>
<p>Considering this tension between fast and slow; there’s always a consideration
of Aesop’s fable of the tortoise and the hare.  A fable that was apart of
my upbringing, but less so for my children, and I suspect less so now.</p>
<p>I appreciate that Tracy’s post left breadcrumbs for fellow travelers.  Eating
those breadcrumbs brought about memories of past reading feasts.  Some of those
being what I’ve written as section quotes, but others, such as <cite data-id="A6E49A97-C58B-44B3-A755-1CA627C0B8E5">Wanderlust</cite> by Rebecca Solnit, being from an era before I wrote down
much of my reading.</p>
<p>Looking to <a href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/epigraphs/">my collected epigraphs</a>, when I read Tracy’s post and the
constellation of related posts, my first thoughts were to death: in which our
hastening culture, I suspect, is hoping to outrun.</p>
<p>I find this paradoxical, in that the dominant culture in which I live, claims
that through resurrection death has no sting.  Yet the actions seem to indicate
otherwise.  As though the denouncement were in fact a confession of fear.  Of
recognizing that “going fast and breaking things” might well catch up with you.</p>
<p>I know I want less broken things (and certainly less broken people).</p>
