iPhone users will be able to wirelessly stream videos to the CarPlay screen using AirPlay, according to Apple. For safety reasons, video playback will only be available when the vehicle is parked, to prevent distracted driving. The connected iPhone will be able to detect when the vehicle is in motion and end playback.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that automakers need to add support for CarPlay with AirPlay video, so it will likely take some time to roll out. It appears that the AirPlay functionality will be available for both regular CarPlay and the higher-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">CarPlay Ultra</a>, but it is unclear if it will be enabled in any existing vehicles, or if it will be limited to new vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
From the CarPlay page on Apple's developer website:<blockquote><strong>Video in the car</strong><br/>
<br/>
AirPlay video in the car enables people to watch their favorite videos from iPhone right on their CarPlay display when they aren't driving. Integrate support for CarPlay with AirPlay video to enable this feature in your car.</blockquote>This feature would be especially beneficial in electric vehicles with CarPlay, as it would provide the driver and any passengers with entertainment while they are parked at a charging station. Some electric vehicles already offer this capability natively. Tesla, for example, has long offered a Theater app that can play videos from apps like Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and Twitch on the dashboard screen, while the vehicle is parked.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not shared any further details or images for AirPlay video in the car. Availability of the feature might vary by country based on safety regulations.<br/>
<br/>
There were already some unapproved ways to watch videos through CarPlay, with various jailbreak tweaks and TestFlight beta apps promising to unlock such functionality. Now, it is something that Apple will officially allow.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/carplay-airplay-video-in-the-car/">Apple to Let iPhone Users Watch Videos on CarPlay Screen While Parked</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-let-iphone-users-watch-videos-on-carplay-screen-while-parked.2458852/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
