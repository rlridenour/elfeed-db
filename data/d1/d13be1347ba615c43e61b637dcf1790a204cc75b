<p>House Democrats published a tranche of roughly 20,000 pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate that include emails in which Epstein wrote that President Trump “knew about the girls,” and that a victim “spent hours at my house with him,” according to the released files. The documents contain multiple references to Mr. Trump across messages dated in the 2010s, and include exchanges between Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex‑trafficking offences. The White House disputed the significance of the release, calling the disclosures a selective smear and saying they prove nothing about wrongdoing by the President; President Trump has denied culpability and said he ended his friendship with Epstein in the early 2000s.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/MsHJ9gHBnFB5eexSClqSQ4ArhU0HOh5-AifESEevEsT5Sg15VAG90xQRzo9UOVAn3VhoIMKtPQFjWlCDt1dohJ1u18R7l47vulk-A247mSiXTruZkKD9boN7Uh09xjuBTri8yMpIajnZBtnsXVpMQgN5AaWhRzJrHoaOPLLiz4RAYHbXIxkc5KSibdbbpHfcyMZqMwiFq1dDLPbayxF1zY-DyYqF-GgaOo0vpyIyDdoPFdJ4mJ7VFiCbQtPOI4AdO2PXTbm5RBq6' alt='An art installation depicting Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein during a protest in Washington, October 3, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Epstein&#x27;s language: In the emails Epstein repeatedly insults Trump, calling him phrases such as “borderline insane,” “a maniac,” and “f**king crazy,” showing a hostile tone in some exchanges.</li><li>Staff monitoring: The documents indicate Epstein’s staff kept him informed about other people’s air travel and that Epstein tracked media and movements tied to his former associates.</li><li>Prince Andrew links: The release also contains messages showing former prince Andrew asked Epstein for help responding to press inquiries in 2011, writing “I can’t take any more of this,” which raises separate questions about his timeline with Epstein.</li><li>Redactions present: Some pages were redacted in the public release, with at least one victim’s name blacked out in messages that mention alleged encounters.</li></ul><blockquote>Prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong. - Karoline Leavitt</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>House Democrats: Democrats say the documents were released to shed light on Epstein’s network and to raise questions about who knew what and when.
