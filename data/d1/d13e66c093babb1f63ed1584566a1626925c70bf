<p>Stephen Hackett recently <a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/05/riffing-on-apple-jam-packs/">wrote a delightful article on Apple Jam Packs</a> that made me smile. If you were using Apple gear during a certain decade, saving up for and buying Apple Jam Packs was one of the delights of the platform.</p>



<p>I remember slowly adding to my collection over a few years and the thrill of exploring all the loops, rhythms, and instruments with each new purchase. Folks that were there may disagree as to what the best Jam Pack was, and everyone is entitled to their opinion, so long as they acknowledge that, without a doubt, the World Music Jam Pack was the clear winner.</p>



<p>If you have the original first edition OmniFocus Field Guide, first, <em>bless you</em>, and, second, all the transition music in it was World Music Jam Pack loops.</p>
