<p>&#8220;Violence has plummeted in a Norfolk [England] prison where inmates have been learning Greek philosophy,&#8221; the <em>Eastern Daily Press </em><a href="https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/25294227.assaults-fall-hmp-wayland-greek-philosophy-classes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>. But violence has not plummeted in the prison, and it&#8217;s unclear whether whatever changes have occurred there have anything to do with inmates learning philosophy.<span id="more-54272"></span></p>

News</a></em>, is highly misleading.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the correlation it imagines may be worth investigating more generally.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s actually the case, according to the 2023-2024 <a href="https://cloud-platform-e218f50a4812967ba1215eaecede923f.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/sites/13/2025/03/Wayland-IMB-2023-24-annual-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annual Report</a> of the Independent Monitoring Board  (IMB) at the prison, HMP Wayland (published in March, 2025):</p>
<ul>
<li>Some inmates at the prison have taken a course &#8220;heavily influenced by the Greek philosophy of stoicism&#8221;</li>
<li>The course is taught by prison staff</li>
<li>The course is voluntary, &#8220;well-attended and well-received&#8221; by inmates and offered regularly</li>
<li>The IMB sees the initiative &#8220;as an expanded weapon in its war on the evils of drugs and to improve the rehabilitation chances of its prisoners&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Drugs are readily and easily available, prisoners tell us, in every wing and unit of the prison&#8212;even in the ‘drug free’ unit&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Assaults on staff are lower than comparator average and have shown a gradual reduction over the year&#8221;</li>
<li>There has been an &#8220;uptick trend seen in the last 12 months&#8221; in prison-on-prisoner violence.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there seems to be no evidence whatsoever that, as the article suggests, philosophy courses in the prison have led to a significant drop in prison violence. Even where there has been a &#8220;gradual reduction&#8221;&#8212;in inmate assaults on staff&#8212;we have no idea about the cause; the report&#8217;s findings are compatible with all of the remaining cases of such violence being the students, in Socratic frustration, assaulting the staff teaching them philosophy.</p>
<p>That said, there is an interesting question here about the effects of teaching philosophy in prison. There are a number of such initiatives (see some of the posts listed <a href="https://dailynous.com/tag/prison/">here</a>). And there is some data about the benefits of prison education programs in general, for which &#8220;the effect sizes have ranged from modest to relatively large&#8221; (<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-better-path-forward-for-criminal-justice-training-and-employment-for-correctional-populations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brookings</a>). But has there been any work attempting to explore whether prison instruction in <em>philosophy</em> specifically is correlated with desired outcomes on things like inmate and staff violence and safety, earlier parole, reduced recidivism, reduced drug abuse, better post-imprisonment employment, and so on?</p>
