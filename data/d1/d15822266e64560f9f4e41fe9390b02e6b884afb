<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta 2 adds full support for the order tracking feature that Apple announced at WWDC. In the Wallet app, there is an option to let <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> scan your Mail app to find all orders and emails from merchants, even if those orders weren't made with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>.<br/>

The Wallet app previously had an order tracking feature, but it was only an option when an order was made using &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Order tracking was partially working in the initial &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; beta, but the functionality was limited. The Wallet app is now able to scan your email and pull in all recent order emails with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In the Wallet app, orders can be accessed by tapping on the "..." button and choosing the "Orders" option. Using on-device intelligence to scan the Mail app is opt-in.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is limited to developers right now, but a beta will be made available to public beta testers in July. The order tracking option will require an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that supports &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/23/ios-26-wallet-order-tracking/">iOS 26 Beta 2 Expands Support for Order Tracking in Wallet</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-beta-2-expands-support-for-order-tracking-in-wallet.2459547/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
