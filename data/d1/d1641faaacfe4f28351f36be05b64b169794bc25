Apple today released new firmware for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2 earbuds that came out earlier this year. The updated firmware has a version number of 7B30, an update to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-firmware-update/">prior 7B24 firmware</a> that Apple seeded out just after the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 launched.<br/>

We don't know what's included in the firmware, but the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 have a unique heart rate monitoring feature that's new to Apple earbuds, so it's possible the update is related to that feature.<br/>
<br/>
Along with heart rate monitoring that's done through optical LED sensors in the earbuds, the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 feature Active Noise Cancellation, Personalized Spatial Audio, Apple's H2 chip for connectivity, and a redesigned acoustic architecture that allows for better sound.<br/>
<br/>
The updated firmware can be installed on the &zwnj;Powerbeats Pro&zwnj; 2 by connecting them to power and ensuring that they are in Bluetooth range of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac that's connected to Wi-Fi. Firmware can be checked on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by going to Settings &gt; Bluetooth and tapping the Info button next to the Beats headphones in the list. Android users can download new Beats firmware through the Beats app for Android.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-releases-powerbeats-pro-2-firmware-7b30/">Apple Releases New Firmware for Powerbeats Pro 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-firmware-for-powerbeats-pro-2.2454044/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
