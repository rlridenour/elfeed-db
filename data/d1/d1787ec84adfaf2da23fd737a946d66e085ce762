A quick post today.
</p>
<p>
Charles Choi has just released another app in his Casual suite. This time it&rsquo;s for <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/announcing-casual-man-and-help.html">the <code>man</code> and <code>help</code> modes</a>. We all use these all the time, of course, but there are plenty of obscure bindings that most of us don&rsquo;t remember. As usual Choi&rsquo;s app helps with that by providing easily invoked menus.
</p>
<p>
Along the way, Choi also tells us about some little known features of <code>man</code> and <code>help</code> mode. For instance, when in man mode, you can press <kbd>Return</kbd> when the point is on another command and Emacs will open the man page for that command whether or not it&rsquo;s an actual link. There are a couple of other nice facts like that so be sure to take a look at Choi&rsquo;s post.

As I always say when I do one these posts, Choi&rsquo;s Casual suite just keeps getting better and better and since you can use the same binding to invoke the appropriate menu, they&rsquo;re easy to use and well worth installing.</p>
