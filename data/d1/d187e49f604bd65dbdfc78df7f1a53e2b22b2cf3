<p>Myanmar’s military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) said it had won a majority in a junta-run election that concluded on Sunday, as voting took place in phases over about a month. International and democracy-monitoring groups criticized the process, with the UN among those raising concerns, and reports noting that key opposition forces were excluded while prominent leader Aung San Suu Kyi remains detained and her party has been dissolved. The military seized power in a 2021 coup and has portrayed the vote as part of a plan to return authority to civilians, but the country has remained locked in civil war since the takeover.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gRbVCJJmvkmQ-_I4KGGhQOjKvftWFBIEAPMfVtkjpXykH7N09mx9igXdi6dUYVf27fZ27Lt08ILv7SJBlu4Awxu2usjSdpZh-s3XSSTnT7iGyloBLm1gYO7xLaP3y3HVh5gOVmLyFnsaHhoWKOidQHG4yGqVungUi8hGyqlXNoCHzC-9ow' alt='A polling station in Yangon, Myanmar, on January 25, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Final voting phase: The Associated Press reported citizens cast ballots in the third and final phase to elect Myanmar’s bicameral legislature, underscoring the staged, multi-phase structure of the vote.</li><li>Three-step pledge: The junta said the election followed a three-phase roadmap intended to “return power to the people,” a claim challenged by watchdogs who described the process as a rebranding of military rule.</li><li>Proxy party: Analysts described the USDP as a civilian proxy for the armed forces that took power in 2021, shaping perceptions of how much autonomy any elected body would hold.</li><li>Opposition sidelined: Reports highlighted that major opposition actors were kept out of the contest, alongside the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, limiting the vote’s competitiveness.</li><li>Global criticism: Coverage noted broad international condemnation of the election’s credibility, with concerns framed around exclusion, security conditions, and the wider political crisis.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Myanmar junta: The military authorities presented the phased election as a pathway to restore power to the public through a structured voting process.
