Apple CEO Tim Cook has once again paid tribute to Jobs.<br/>
<br/>
"Steve saw the future as a bright and boundless place, lit the path forward, and inspired us to follow," said Cook, in a <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1974822379663589796">post</a> today. "We miss you, my friend."<br/>
<br/>
Cook also reflected on Jobs while opening Apple's first-ever event at Steve Jobs Theater in 2017.<br/>
<br/>
"There is not a day that goes by that we don't think about him," he said then.<br/>

At that event, Apple unveiled the iPhone X, which was a major update to the smartphone that Jobs had famously unveiled in 2007.<br/>
