Apple plans to release a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in 2026, and will then follow it up with a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> in 2028, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/wagmqku5BLUxzH">said today</a>.<br/>

Multiple sources have now confirmed that Apple is planning to release its first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in 2026, with the device coming as part of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> lineup. Launch timing on a larger-screened foldable device has been more uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
Originally, rumors indicated that the foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; or MacBook would come before the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">have been launch rumors</a> with dates ranging from 2026 to 2028. Rumors have also varied between calling the foldable device an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and a MacBook, but it seems like all of the information about a larger foldable refers to the same product. The foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; could have a screen between 18 and 20 inches when unfolded, with a smaller form factor when closed.<br/>
<br/>
According to Kuo, Apple is using ultra-thin cover glass for both the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, which is a rumor that we've heard before. Corning will supply the ultra-thin cover glass, but General Interface Solutions (GIS) will work with Corning on cutting, corner treatments, inspection, packaging, and shipping.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo expects Apple to sell somewhere between 8 to 10 million foldable iPhones in 2026, and up to 25 million in 2027. The larger-screened foldable is not expected to sell as well because Kuo says it will be priced "considerably higher" than the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/02/foldable-iphone-foldable-ipad-launch-dates/">Foldable iPhone Coming in 2026, Foldable iPad to Follow in 2028</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-coming-in-2026-foldable-ipad-to-follow-in-2028.2464490/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
