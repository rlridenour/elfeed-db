"My research indicates that Amazon is also internally developing a similar product, which has not yet officially kicked off," said Kuo in a <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1924786064914579735">post on X (Twitter)</a>. Kuo added that the device is projected to enter mass production in late 2026 or 2027 if development progresses on schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/">planning a foldable device</a> of a similar vein. Rumors suggest that the dual-screen foldable will be around 13 inches when folded and 18.8 inches when unfolded. Rumors are conflicting on whether it will be an iPad or a MacBook, but the defining factor will be the operating system.<br/>

Kuo believes Apple's large-sized foldable is scheduled to enter mass production in late 2027 or 2028. Apple is concurrently developing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">foldable iPhone</a> that is expected to launch towards the end of 2026.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/apples-large-sized-foldable-amazon-rival/">Apple&#039;s Large-Sized Foldable Device Could Have an Amazon Rival</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-large-sized-foldable-device-could-have-an-amazon-rival.2457386/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
