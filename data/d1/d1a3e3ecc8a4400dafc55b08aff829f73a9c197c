<blockquote>
  <p>Apple chip leader Johny Srouji addressed rumors of his impending
exit in a memo to staff on Monday, saying he doesn’t plan on
leaving the company anytime soon. “I love my team, and I love my
job at Apple, and I don’t plan on leaving anytime soon,” he wrote.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-06/apple-rocked-by-executive-departures-with-johny-srouji-at-risk-of-leaving-next">Bloomberg reported</a> on Saturday that Srouji had told CEO Tim
Cook that he was considering leaving, citing people with knowledge
of the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn’t <em>rumors</em>, plural. It was one report, on Saturday, from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, and Srouji just called bullshit on it.</p>

<p>What a colossal fuck-up for Gurman and Bloomberg. There’s no possible scenario where Srouji was threatening to leave Apple for a competitor on Saturday and telling his staff (in a memo meant to leak to the press) “I love my job at Apple, and I don’t plan on leaving anytime soon” Monday morning.</p>

<p>The most gracious interpretation for Gurman and Bloomberg is that Srouji <em>had</em> expressed this to Cook, at some point in the recent past, and Cook addressed whatever it took to keep Srouji on board. But even in that scenario, they ran a story Saturday that was wrong at the time it was published.</p>

<p>The more likely scenario is <a href="https://x.com/neilcybart/status/1998143342786515351">the one suggested by Neil Cybart</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If someone wanted to sow seeds of doubt among Apple employees in
an effort to help their own poaching efforts, there are at least
three publications who would have no problem offering an anonymous
microphone to that person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I.e., the source for this story about Srouji being unhappy at Apple and considering leaving for a competitor was aligned with one of those competitors, and Gurman and his editors at Bloomberg said “Sure, we’ll print that.” Meta, of course, is the competitor that comes to mind.</p>

<p>It speaks to Gurman’s personal and Bloomberg’s institutional influence that Srouji and Apple saw the need to shoot the bogus narrative down in public like this. I can’t remember the last time an Apple executive saw the need to send an intended-to-leak memo like this to shoot down one bogus story. After <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/05/apple-announces-a-few-other-executive-transitions">last week</a>, though, this one couldn’t be ignored.</p>
