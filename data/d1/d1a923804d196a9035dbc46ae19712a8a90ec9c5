<blockquote>
  <p>Lumafield has <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/battery-report#battery-quality-report">released the results of a new study</a> of
lithium-ion batteries that “reveals an enormous gap in quality
between brand-name batteries and low-cost cells” that are readily
available through online stores including Amazon and Temu. The
company used <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/18/23640484/lumafield-neptune-ct-scanner-3d-x-ray-hands-on-interview">its computed tomography (CT) scanners</a>, capable
of peering inside objects in 3D using X-rays, to analyze over
1,000 lithium-ion batteries. It found dangerous manufacturing
defects in low-cost and counterfeit batteries that could
potentially lead to fires and explosions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My gut feeling has long been that cheap battery packs and cheap products with integrated batteries (like all the junk Temu sells) are dangerous. This analysis basically proves it. (I’d have linked directly to Lumafield’s report, but it’s only available by submitting your name and email address, so Liszewski’s summary at The Verge is a better quick read.)</p>
