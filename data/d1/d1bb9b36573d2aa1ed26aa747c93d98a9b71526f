<p>Another quick note about Journelly -</p>
<p>Álvaro Ramírez was kind enough to grant me access to test the app after I found out it&rsquo;s based on org-mode.</p>
<p>I just started playing around with it but so far I&rsquo;m impressed, particularly with its ability to &ldquo;talk to&rdquo; Emacs back on my Mac. I can easily edit notes that I created on the phone, and these edits, including links, strikethroughs, and lists, show up on the app in turn.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more to explore and the app is still in beta, so I will give it a couple of days before I write something more thorough.</p>
