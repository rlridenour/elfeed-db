<p>A 13-year-old boy from Perth, Australia, swam for several hours through rough seas to reach shore and raise the alarm after his mother and two younger siblings were blown far out from a holiday beach on kayaks and a paddleboard in Geographe Bay, Western Australia, on Friday evening. Police say the boy, Austin Appelbee, covered about 4 kilometers (around 2.5 miles) without a life jacket as winds and large waves pushed the family farther offshore, leaving the others clinging to a single paddleboard. Once on land he ran along the beach to get a mobile signal, contacted emergency services and guided rescuers to the area, helping a multi-agency response involving boats and aircraft locate his family roughly 14 kilometers from shore later that night. All four family members were eventually brought to safety with symptoms of hypothermia but no life-threatening injuries, and police and local officials have publicly praised the teenager’s endurance and calm decision-making as crucial to the successful rescue.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ZitBs2iXlXo-a909tC58_sg40vaLvgtxYF2PxQqRF2iDs41lcrZMM12Ss_2Typi5NK2YDWIn8oS9GY3zxehwpFA2x309ub3uOcB61JGZ6T71QduZB_nI8I16pGoRl34di2mtkeZ0rjIqvjyIlqeGKtHRaD6SKm5ZIPRdhvmU0oqef7y-MCpInWlNOTcmbc6FXAaNdpQARHi-jMXciknNgMThpjKP0u2a8nmmZ1iN_yUdQYFc2omys_QMNOPjJP7M0evJ06qw5wh8hlIvqg' alt='Austin Appelbee with his mother Joanne, brother Beau and sister Grace after the rescue in Western Australia.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Challenging conditions: Authorities reported that strengthening offshore winds, strong currents and increasingly large waves rapidly carried the family’s kayaks and paddleboard away from the sheltered part of Geographe Bay into deeper, colder water, complicating both Austin’s swim and the subsequent search effort.</li><li>Rescue operation: Water police, marine rescue volunteers and rescue helicopters from multiple agencies converged on the search zone after Austin’s call, with air crews using night-vision equipment to spot the remaining three family members in the darkness before boats retrieved them from the water.</li><li>Mother’s decision: Austin’s mother, Joanne Appelbee, later described instructing her son to leave them and swim for help as one of the hardest choices she had ever made, but said she believed it was the only realistic way to get rescuers to them before nightfall and colder conditions set in.</li><li>Medical aftermath: After their recovery, paramedics treated the mother and two younger children for exposure and mild hypothermia, while Austin—who collapsed from exhaustion on reaching land—was checked in hospital and discharged, allowing the reunited family to pose together for photos the following days.</li><li>Officials’ praise: Western Australia police and rescue officials publicly commended Austin’s strong swimming skills, mental focus and refusal to panic as decisive factors, noting that his actions greatly narrowed the search area and likely turned what could have been a prolonged missing-persons case into a same-day rescue.</li></ul><blockquote>I just kept thinking &#x27;just keep swimming, just keep swimming&#x27; - Austin Appelbee</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Austin Appelbee: Austin said he focused on thinking of his mother and siblings and on repeating a simple phrase to himself while swimming so he would not give up despite exhaustion and fear in the large waves.
