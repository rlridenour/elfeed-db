I recently implemented a small slide-show banner for showcasing products, in this case books, that works across sites. I did it with a nice JQuery slideshow plugin and iframes. I happened to be inserting it into Wordpress pages.
The Problem My client has three separate websites he uses for distinct blogs, but as an author he wants to showcase the books he&rsquo;s published on each of them. It will be a major problem to implement three distinct solutions, even if they are identical, for each blog, and update each one whenever something changes (such as a new book coming out).
