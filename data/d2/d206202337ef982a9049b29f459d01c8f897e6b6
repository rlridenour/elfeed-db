<p>I love org mode, I do, but as I read through my tiddlywiki pages &ndash; the way I constructed the table of contents, the explanations, the log explaining what I did and when, the way you can open the tiddler and see what makes it work. It&rsquo;s just makes sense. With Emacs, I sometimes have to scratch my head for hours if not days.</p>
