<p>European Union foreign ministers agreed on Jan. 29 to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, a significant policy shift intended to increase pressure on Tehran over its violent crackdown on nationwide protests. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the move was a response to what the EU describes as deadly repression and widespread human rights abuses. Alongside the designation, the EU also adopted a new round of sanctions targeting 15 Iranian individuals and six entities linked to the crackdown, according to multiple reports. Several outlets noted the decision brings the EU closer to positions already taken by countries including the United States and Canada. While the measure is framed by EU officials as accountability for abuses, Iran rejected the move and warned it could heighten tensions; Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called it a “PR stunt,” according to RT. Even so, EU officials said diplomatic channels would remain open after the listing, signaling the bloc’s stated aim of combining pressure with continued engagement where possible.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/oTOo1clEbJMYN665HRyfhDVuubKzu6Voa7uPbUD6Z_eAybJW7XOjlXnfdjn862WmtEoom_-OWx7ueQktOfTwP17LY-eRZRm4SebeSoCr16dhfgsJjk6yB0eRokchgVfHw-a8BDsABmcB4dxRFe_DppB-yRNWvf0SXsIWu8cMuZ9pHn9jXItJZXJB9RU' alt='A photo verified by The New York Times shows a screen grab from social media of bodies in body bags outside a morgue in Tehran after days of protests, earlier this month.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Unanimous vote: Kaja Kallas said EU foreign ministers reached unanimity on the terror designation, underscoring a rare 27-country consensus after years of internal debate.</li><li>Prior reluctance: Politico reported that France and Italy had previously opposed blacklisting the IRGC, citing concerns about cutting diplomatic channels, but shifted as the crackdown intensified.</li><li>How Iran’s elite force works: Background explainers describe the IRGC (also known as the Pasdaran) as an ideological military force tasked with protecting the Islamic Republic from internal and external threats, and one that Western governments accuse of abuses and overseas militant activity.</li><li>Sanctions package: The EU’s additional measures target officials in Iran’s government, judiciary and police, as well as organizations tied to the repression, according to reporting on the new sanctions list.</li><li>EU’s broader agenda: In the same Brussels foreign affairs setting, EU officials also condemned Russia’s ongoing strikes in Ukraine and highlighted growing humanitarian needs amid winter exposure risks.</li></ul><blockquote>Repression cannot go unanswered. - Kaja Kallas</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Union (Kaja Kallas): EU leaders say the designation and sanctions are meant to hold Iranian authorities accountable for repression and deaths during protests.
