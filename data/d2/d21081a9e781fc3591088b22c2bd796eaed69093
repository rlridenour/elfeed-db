While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-reintroduces-magsafe-battery/">iPhone Air MagSafe Battery</a> is not compatible with any other iPhone models, the USB-C port on the battery pack can charge some smaller accessories.<br/>

As noted <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/09/apples-new-magsafe-battery-doesnt-just-work-with-iphone-air/">by <em>9to5Mac</em>'s Zac Hall</a>, the iPhone Air MagSafe Battery <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGPG4AM/A/iphone-air-magsafe-battery">product page</a> has this line:<blockquote>Charge smaller accessories via USB-C</blockquote>Apple says the USB-C port on iPhones can charge an AirPods case, Apple Watch, or another small device that supports USB Power Delivery <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/16/iphone-15-usb-c-port-details/">at up to 4.5W</a>, and the USB-C port on the iPhone Air MagSafe Battery likely behaves the same way.<br/>
<br/>
So long as the iPhone Air MagSafe Battery has a sufficient charge, connecting a USB-C cable from the battery pack to the small accessory will initiate charging of the accessory — it could even be something like a small USB-powered fan.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">original MagSafe Battery Pack</a> with a Lightning port could not charge small accessories like an AirPods case or an Apple Watch in this manner.<br/>
