<p>Aftermath:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to Aftermath, a worker-owned, reader-supported news site
covering video games, the internet, and the cultures that
surround them.</p>

<p>You might remember most of us from Kotaku, where we broke news,
covered events, and brought you hard-hitting investigations. You
might also have seen us at Motherboard by Vice, The Verge and The
Washington Post’s games vertical Launcher. We got back together to
start this site not just so we could all blog together again, but
to try something new for ourselves and for games journalism.</p>

<p>These days it’s tough for journalism, especially about games. The
past few years have seen mass layoffs and site closures, with
remaining writers being asked to do more and more with less and
less. The ad-supported model is crumbling, social media is a mess,
and the businessmen and private equity firms buying up news
outlets don’t care about workers, readers, and quality writing,
they only care about profits. The five of us saw our sites closed,
ourselves and our colleagues laid off, and our workplaces turned
hostile in management’s pursuit of growth at all costs. [...]</p>

<p>As workers and owners, we’re beholden to no one but ourselves, and
to you, our readers. When you <a href="https://aftermath.site/products">subscribe</a>, you’ll get access to
writing that pursues the truth and casts a critical eye on gaming
and the internet, that doesn’t need to placate capital or kowtow
to PR. You’ll be supporting the kind of journalism our past
experience has shown us you like best: honest and irreverent,
written for people rather than SEO. You’ll get a site that
prioritizes the reader experience, with no invasive popups or ads
that burn up your device.</p>

<p>They’re a smart crew, so of course, they’re <em>not</em> launching this on Substack. (They’re using a platform called <a href="https://joinlede.com/">Lede</a>, upon which the excellent <a href="https://defector.com/">Defector</a> has built itself.) How can you not love a site with this ode to a classic bit of kit: “<a href="https://aftermath.site/bob-barker-mic-gameshow-sony-ecm-51-match-game">Bring Back Those Long-Ass Game Show Mics</a>”. An elegant weapon, from a more civilized age.</p>
