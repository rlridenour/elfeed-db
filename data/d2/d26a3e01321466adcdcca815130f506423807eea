Meta offered one of Apple's top artificial intelligence executives over &#36;200 million to lure him away from the company, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/meta-poached-apple-s-pang-with-pay-package-over-200-million?">Bloomberg</a></em> reports.<br/>

Ruoming Pang, who until recently led Apple's foundation models team, departed the company to join Meta's Superintelligence Labs, a newly established division tasked with building advanced AI systems capable of performing at or beyond human-level intelligence. <br/>
<br/>
At Apple, he was in charge of a team with approximately 100 employees that work on Apple's large language models. Models developed by Pang's team are used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features like email summaries, Priority Notifications, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>.<br/>
<br/>
People familiar with the matter speaking to <em>Bloomberg</em> said Meta's offer to Pang includes a substantial base salary, a signing bonus, and a large stock award that forms the majority of the compensation. The full payout is contingent upon performance milestones and continued employment over several years.<br/>
<br/>
Apple apparently did not even attempt to match the offer. The proposed sum significantly exceeds the compensation of all Apple employees, other than that of CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>. Pang's compensation is among the highest ever offered in a corporate setting, rivaling packages for chief executives at major global banks. <br/>
<br/>
In a podcast interview last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Meta had been offering signing bonuses as high as &#36;100 million to attract top talent: "[Meta] started making these giant offers to a lot of people on our team. You know, like &#36;100 million signing bonuses, more than that in compensation per year."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has reportedly appointed Zhifeng Chen as the new head of its Foundation Models team and implemented more a distributed management structure, with responsibilities split among several senior engineers. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to Pang, Meta's Superintelligence Labs now includes prominent figures such as former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, AI startup founder Daniel Gross, and Scale AI co-founder Alexandr Wang.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/meta-offered-apple-ai-executive-over-200-million/">Meta Offered Apple AI Executive Over &#36;200 Million to Leave</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-offered-apple-ai-executive-over-200-million-to-leave.2461287/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
