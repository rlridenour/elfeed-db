The Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 are among the latest additions to the Apple Watch lineup, so how do they compare?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-vs-Series-10-Buyers-Guide.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-970589" /><br/>
Both the Apple Watch Series 11 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3 feature hypertension detection, Sleep Score, sleep apnea detection, speaker playback, an Always-On Retina display, IP6X dust resistance, and more, but there are still significant differences between the two devices. The Apple Watch Ultra focuses on withstanding extreme environments, a high level of durability, extended battery life, and additional features to aid activities like diving and exploration.<br/>
<br/>
With as little as &#36;50 between the 46mm titanium Apple Watch Series 11 and the Apple Watch Ultra, some prospective customers will be weighing up whether it is worth spending a little extra to get the 49mm Ultra model. While there is a &#36;400 difference between the GPS-only 42mm aluminum Apple Watch Series 11 and the Apple Watch Ultra, the high-end model offers a set of features to address specific challenges, so it may even be worth it for some of these buyers. <br/>

The Apple Watch Ultra offers specific capabilities to address the requirements of those who need their Apple Watch to provide assistance in challenging environments. If you need a more durable Apple Watch with features like louder speakers, a more reliable GPS, better water resistance, and more, the Apple Watch Ultra is undoubtedly the best choice. The Apple Watch Ultra is clearly better equipped to handle tasks like hiking, diving, and navigation.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra is also biggest and most feature-rich Apple Watch option available, not to mention that the Ultra form factor offered the first major redesign of the device since its introduction in 2015. For technology enthusiasts, Apple Watch Ultra represents a way to get a new Apple Watch experience with top specifications in several key areas. Features like longer battery life and the Action button are also highly accessible, and will be beneficial to all users. As such, some customers may still be inclined to choose the Apple Watch Ultra 3 over the Apple Watch Series 11, even if they do not need it for use in challenging environments.<br/>
<br/>
As the largest Apple Watch model to date, the size of the Apple Watch Ultra will not be for everyone. If you already prefer the 42mm Apple Watch casing size, the Apple Watch Ultra may be far too large for you. If in doubt, it may be worth heading to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> and trying on the Apple Watch Ultra in person to get to grips with the size and determine if it is too big and bulky for you. It is worth noting that while the 46mm Apple Watch Series 11 has a display size that is very similar to that of the Apple Watch Ultra 3, it is a much smaller device physically.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the Apple Watch Ultra's look may not appeal to some buyers. One of the most important differences between the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 is their designs, with the latter boasting a much chunkier, aggressive look with a flat display. The Apple Watch Series 11 has a much subtler appearance and is available in wider range of finishes, but which look you prefer is ultimately a matter of personal preference. If you prefer the idea of a polished finish and are looking for a more fashion-focused smartwatch that pairs well with premium bands, the more aggressive, rugged design of the Apple Watch Ultra may not be for you. <br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 11 continues to be thinner, lighter, and cheaper than the Apple Watch Ultra. It also charges more quickly, but with a considerably shorter battery life. <br/>
<br/>
If the Apple Watch Ultra is out of your price range but you still want to use your Apple Watch in challenging environments, it is worth bearing in mind that the Series 11 still offers a durable design with a strong front crystal, water resistance, and many of the Apple Watch Ultra's software features like waypoint marking.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra 3 has a lot to offer, especially for the subset of users who can take advantage of all of its capabilities, so it is certainly worth considering when purchasing a new model, but the Apple Watch Series 11 is still a compelling all-around option that comes in at a lower price point with a subtler design.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 11</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-11-vs-ultra-3/">Apple Watch Series 11 vs. Ultra 3 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 30+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-11-vs-ultra-3-buyers-guide-30-differences-compared.2466081/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
