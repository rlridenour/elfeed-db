<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has again ruled out giving Russia any Ukrainian territory as part of a U.S.-backed plan to halt the fighting, even as he works on a revised peace proposal for Washington. He says an original 28-point plan put forward by U.S. negotiators has been trimmed to 20 points after Kyiv removed what he called clearly anti‑Ukrainian provisions, and he plans to send refined documents to President Trump soon. President Trump has argued that Russia currently has the upper hand militarily and has pressed Zelenskyy, via envoys, to respond within days in hopes of reaching at least a cease-fire by Christmas. While Zelenskyy insists Ukraine has &quot;no moral right&quot; to cede land, he also continues diplomatic outreach, meeting European leaders and Pope Leo to shore up support for a settlement based on Ukraine’s own ten‑point peace formula and international law.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/80nqS_tkafyLPinicotfgtI4su8Sin12lEm2ZC2yMPWi6N-bzJ4UefZZBu8EbRtzKjUP6UBjPZP5p3Bhq5FWq2tdKwtvGNiwz4xbS0Wr9zsgrQmvdr14DOTWmXuQXHy4q0W2ak0hKM2Kw36wY_IVq2ouQKk-9Vk05QiaQt-vvxuTeGEUhqS2V8lOcPpXy3CePG_YOGaV1P6bg0RXc4exxSRSP4HHhWkUAAgG_y6JXhf1V3fjvWt_3AOVz41p99ZwCM3eAcizCyDFgXQz8w' alt='A Ukrainian serviceman walks past buildings damaged by shelling in the frontline town of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk region.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>U.S. proposal details: Zelenskyy says earlier drafts of the U.S. plan included language recognizing Crimea and Donbas as de facto Russian and calling for Ukrainian troop withdrawals from parts of Donetsk, clauses he claims Kyiv successfully persuaded Washington to remove.</li><li>European diplomacy: During a trip that included London, Zelenskyy met leaders of the U.K., France, and Germany to coordinate a joint position before sending Ukraine’s counter‑proposal back to Washington.</li><li>Papal engagement: Zelenskyy also met Pope Leo at the Vatican as part of efforts to rally moral and diplomatic backing for a settlement that, in Kyiv’s view, upholds Ukraine’s territorial integrity.</li><li>Military situation: Analysts cited in U.S. media say Russian forces captured roughly 200 square miles of territory in November, deepening concern in Western capitals about Ukraine’s manpower shortages and battlefield position.</li><li>Communication strains: President Trump has publicly expressed disappointment with Zelenskyy, alleging that the Ukrainian leader has not fully engaged with the most recent U.S. proposal and hinting that Kyiv risks being seen as an obstacle to peace.</li></ul><blockquote>Undoubtedly, Russia insists for us to give up territories.
