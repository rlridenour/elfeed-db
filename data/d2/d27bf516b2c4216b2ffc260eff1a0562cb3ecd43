<p>In 2004, <a href="https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/john-horton-conway">John Conway</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://asoifer.uccs.edu/">Alexander Soifer</a>, both working on mathematics at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>, submitted to the <em><a href="https://maa.org/publication/the-american-mathematical-monthly/">American Mathematical Monthly</a>&nbsp;</em>what they believed was “a new world record in the number of words in a [math] paper.”</p>
<p>Soifer <a href="http://www.wfnmc.org/mc20101.pdf">explains</a>: “On April 28,&nbsp;2004&nbsp;…&nbsp;I submitted our&nbsp;paper that included just two words, ‘n2 + 2 can’ and our two drawings. [See one of them above.]” The story then continues: “<em>The American Mathematical Monthly</em> was surprised, and did not know&nbsp;what to do about our new world record of a 2‑word article. Two days&nbsp;later, on April 30, 2004, the Editorial Assistant Mrs. Margaret Combs&nbsp;acknowledged the receipt of the paper”:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Monthly publishes exposition of mathematics at many levels,&nbsp;and it contains articles both long and short. Your article, however,&nbsp;is a bit too short to be a good Monthly article… A line or two of&nbsp;explanation would really help.</p></blockquote>
<p>Soifer writers: “The same day at the coffee hour I asked John [Conway], ‘What do you think?’ His answer was concise, ‘Do not give up too easily.’ Accordingly, I replied [to] The Monthly the same day”:</p>
<blockquote><p>I respectfully disagree that a short paper in general—and this paper&nbsp;in particular—merely due to its size must be “a bit too short to be a&nbsp;good Monthly article.” Is there a connection between quantity and&nbsp;quality?… We have posed a fine (in our opinion) open problem and&nbsp;reported two distinct “behold-style” proofs of our advance on this&nbsp;problem. What else is there to explain?</p></blockquote>
<p>Soifer adds: “<em>The Monthly</em>, apparently felt outgunned, for on May 4, 2004, the reply came from <em>The Monthly</em>’s top gun, Editor-in-Chief Bruce Palka”:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Monthly publishes two types of papers: “articles,” which are&nbsp;substantive expository papers ranging in length from about six to&nbsp;twenty-five pages, and “notes,” which are shorter, frequently somewhat&nbsp;more technical pieces (typically in the one-to-five page range).&nbsp;I can send your paper to the notes editor if you wish, but I expect&nbsp;that he’ll not be interested in it either because of its length and lack&nbsp;of any substantial accompanying text. The standard way in which&nbsp;we use such short papers these days is as “boxed filler” on pages that&nbsp;would otherwise contain a lot of the blank space that publishers abhor. If you’d allow us to use your paper in that way, I’d be happy&nbsp;to publish it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Soifer concludes: “John Conway and I accepted the ‘filler’, and in the January 2005 issue&nbsp;our paper was published.” Victory!</p>
