<p>UPDATE: Flat Habits now has its own page at <a href="https://flathabits.com/">flathabits.com</a>.</p>
<p>Flat Habits v1.0.1 is now released and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1558358855">available</a> in the App Store.</p>
<h2>org import (import vs in-place)</h2>
<p>We can now import org files from the menu. Importing gives ya the option to either import (copy into the app) or open in-place. The latter enables users to sync org files with other iOS apps or just open/edit from Emacs for the full org-mode/agenda experience.</p>

<p>Syncing with your desktop can be achieved by either iCloud or by enabling other providers in the Files app (after installing the likes of Google Drive, Dropbox, etc).</p>
<p><em>Please note that importing (copying into the app) is currently the recommended flow.</em> Opening in-place and syncing is still fairly experimental, so please back up your org files regularly. If you do run into syncing issues, please get in touch.</p>
<p>Good luck with your habits!</p>
