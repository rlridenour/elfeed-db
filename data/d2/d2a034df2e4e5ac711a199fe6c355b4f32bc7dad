<p>I&rsquo;ve always struggled to use jq and at this point I&rsquo;ve given up on ever learning
the jq language.
André Arko <a href="https://andre.arko.net/2025/06/13/fx.wtf/">posted about a new jq alternative</a>
called <code>fx</code>, which uses Javascript instead of its own language.
I already know Javascript, so maybe it&rsquo;ll be easier for me to use!</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really adopted it yet but I like the idea, so I&rsquo;m putting it here
so that I can look it up when I inevitably forget &ldquo;hey, what was that new jq
alternative again?&rdquo;</p>
