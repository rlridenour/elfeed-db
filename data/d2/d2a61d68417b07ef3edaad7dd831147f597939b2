In an all-hands meeting with employees today, Apple CEO Tim Cook promised to lobby the U.S. government on immigration, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/apple-s-cook-vows-to-lobby-lawmakers-on-immigration-issue"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

Cook said he is "deeply distraught" with the U.S. government's current approach to immigration, and he promised to make his voice heard on the matter, the report said.<br/>
<br/>
"For as long as I can remember, we have been a smarter, wiser, more innovative company because we've attracted the best and brightest from all corners of the world," Cook told employees, according to the report. Cook ensured that he would "continue to lobby lawmakers on this issue" going forward, per the report.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said immigration is especially important to Apple because the company has "team members across the U.S. on some form of visa," the report said.<br/>
<br/>
Cook also reiterated his support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy.<br/>
<br/>
In a memo last month, Cook said he was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/27/tim-cook-responds-after-minneapolis-shootings/">"heartbroken" about recent events in Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>, after two people were killed by U.S. federal immigration agents there. The killings stoked public outcry in the country.<br/>
<br/>
"This is a time for deescalation," said Cook, in the memo. "I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they're from, and when we embrace our shared humanity. This is something Apple has always advocated for."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-immigration/">Apple CEO Tim Cook Promises to Lobby U.S. Government on Immigration</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-promises-to-lobby-u-s-government-on-immigration.2477245/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
