<p>Following up on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/12/that-stupid-apple-notes-a">my gripe regarding the alternative <em>a</em> glyph</a> used in Apple Notes, here’s <a href="https://www.threads.com/@kfury/post/DJlFkNfR5ik">Kevin Fox, tweeting on Threads</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While we’re waxing nostalgic on the Original Mac, a Daring
Fireball post today (below) reminded me of another piece of Mac
128k trivia.</p>

<p>Until shortly before the official release, the ‘a’ in Geneva was a
single story ‘a’ like you see currently (and to some,
infuriatingly) in the Notes app.</p>

<p>The screenshots in the original Mac 128k user manual show the OS
using the pre-release single-story ‘a’ before it was changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I double-checked using the (amazing) <a href="https://infinitemac.org/">classic Mac emulators at Infinite Mac</a>, and it turns out, Apple actually shipped System 1.0 with a version of Geneva with a single-story <em>a</em> glyph — but only in the 9-point version of Geneva. At 12 points (and larger), Geneva’s <em>a</em> was double-story. Here are screenshots of the Finder showing Geneva 9 in System 1.0 (with single-story <em>a</em>):</p>

<p>And System 2.0 (with double-story <em>a</em>):</p>

    width = 512
  /></a></p>

<p>And a screenshot of MacWrite running on System 1.0 showing Geneva 9 and 12:</p>

<p>Geneva 9 — the eventual version, with a double-story <em>a</em> — is so intimately familiar to me that looking at those screenshots from System 1.0 makes me feel weird. It’s so clearly wrong. (What it feels like, to me, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/1e5k4xb/a_few_years_ago_i_bought_a_beautiful_transparent/">is the original Palm OS</a>, from the one-bit Palm Pilot / Handspring Visor days. Palm’s small sans serif font was very Geneva-9-ish, but their single-story <em>a</em> was distinctive.)</p>

<p>Fox also posted a link to <a href="https://vintageapple.org/macmanuals/pdf/Macintosh_1984.pdf">Vintage Apple’s high-res scan of the amazing original Mac user manual</a>, which, because it had to go to press before the 1.0 software was finished, contains screenshots of a few icons <a href="https://www.threads.com/@johncsiracusa/post/DJniWZ3NCCR">that changed by the time the original Mac was in customers’ hands</a>. What a remarkably good user manual this is — everything from the typography, to the clarity and tone of its writing, to its comprehensiveness is exemplary.</p>

<p>Here’s where it really gets nutty though. Marcin Wichary — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/16/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan">whom you may recall</a> from his recent remarkable deep dive on the Gorton typeface (“<a href="https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/">The Hardest Working Font in Manhattan</a>”), or from <em><a href="https://shifthappens.site/">Shift Happens</a></em>, his encyclopedic book on the history of keyboards — <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aresluna.org/post/3lozitikp5k2d">chimed in on Bluesky</a> after observing that a few of the screenshots in that System 1.0 user manual show an early version of Chicago 12 with a single-story <em>a</em>. Seeing a single-story <em>a</em> in Chicago feels more blasphemous than that AI-generated image Trump tweeted of himself <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/04/world/trump-ai-image-pope-intl-hnk">as the new pope</a>.</p>

<p>One last note: I of course am not opposed to single-story <em>a</em>’s. Futura’s <em>a</em> is single-story, and <a href="http://neverusefutura.com/">Futura</a>, depending on my mood, might be my answer if asked to name my favorite typeface of all time. I just don’t particularly care for the alternate single-story <em>a</em> in San Francisco (Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/">modern San Francisco</a>, not <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/system-1.0-san-francisco.png">the one from 1984</a>), and to me it just gives an ever-so-slightly wrong — a little silly or unserious — vibe in the Notes app.</p>
