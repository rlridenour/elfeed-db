<p>Typhoon Fung-wong (locally Uwan) struck the northeastern Philippines over the weekend, prompting authorities to evacuate more than one million people before the storm made landfall on Luzon and causing widespread flooding, power outages and landslides. Official counts of fatalities vary between at least two and up to four as different provinces complete initial searches and assessments. The storm arrived days after Typhoon Kalmaegi swept through parts of the country, leaving hundreds dead, heightening strain on rescue and relief capacity. Meteorological agencies reported Fung-wong as a “super typhoon” with sustained winds near 185 km/h and damaging gusts, and forecasters warned of heavy rainfall and life-threatening storm surges across Luzon.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/LZAllc_7mxxjMWPmuRaeLzBoGqlAv_83i2PLSUl7S1di2LMwRVf1yrvzyNaQ-fwBY5ezni4clm19eCaXObwifE0fPaxNrzkuzP_TRUQJAfAcZ4gB0VpUU9A0ecjGmjOh2P0ZgAc9Go9epgQCwVUBKOZ754ktkoeYmcgrKuy2fKFFIDRKW8S8LLdTVzs5UKZ4tdLvl2CCO-uMUDYslJFHONqkIN8jRCc7O8Y' alt='Workers clear debris from a highway in Dipaculao, Philippines, after Typhoon Fung-wong hit' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Humanitarian response: The World Food Programme and other aid bodies said they were mobilizing emergency assistance and assessments to reach displaced families after the storm</li><li>Rainfall forecast: Forecasters expected more than 200mm of rain over parts of Luzon as Fung-wong passed, raising flood and landslide risk in mountainous and coastal communities</li><li>Strain on rescue operations: Rescue and relief operations for victims of the earlier Typhoon Kalmaegi were temporarily suspended in some areas while authorities prioritized immediate evacuations for Fung-wong</li><li>Storm track: After crossing the Philippines, Fung-wong tracked toward the South China Sea and was being monitored for possible impacts on Taiwan and surrounding waters</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Philippine authorities: Officials ordered mass evacuations, moving more than one million people from high-risk coastal and low-lying areas before landfall to reduce casualties.
