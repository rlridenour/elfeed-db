Apple's updated 14-inch M5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> launched today, and we picked one up to compare it to the prior-generation M4 model to see how performance has changed year over year.<br/>
<br/>

The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> and the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models are identical, and there are no changes to the design. Everything new is inside, and even that's limited.<br/>
<br/>
There's an M5 chip with a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU inside, and it's built on a newer 3-nanometer technology than the equivalent M4 chip in the prior-generation machine.<br/>
<br/>
On Geekbench 6 tests, the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; earned a single-core score of 4220 and a multi-core score of 16781, while the &zwnj;M4 MacBook Pro&zwnj; earned a single-core score of 3834 and a multi-core score of 15453. Apple says that M5 CPU speeds are up to 15 percent faster than M4 speeds.<br/>
<br/>
As for the GPU, the M5 earned an OpenCL score of 48101 and a Metal score of 75536, while the M4 earned a score of 38023 and a Metal Score of 57822. Apple says that GPU speeds are up to 30 percent faster.<br/>
<br/>
SSD speeds have also improved, and Apple says it's up to 2x faster. That proved to be correct in our Blackmagic disk speed tests.<br/>
<br/>
In day to day use, you're not going to see much of a difference between the M4 and the M5 unless you're doing something that maxes out the chip like video editing or 3D rendering. Even then, it's a modest improvement.<br/>
<br/>
There's no reason to upgrade to the M5 from the M4, but if you have an older M-series &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; or even an Intel machine, the performance improvement with the M5 will be night and day.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/22/m5-macbook-pro-first-impressions/">M5 MacBook Pro First Impressions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m5-macbook-pro-first-impressions.2469622/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
