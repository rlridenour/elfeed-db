<p>Polls opened across Tanzania on Wednesday, 29 October 2025, as President Samia Suluhu Hassan sought a second term amid an electoral environment in which major opponents have been jailed or disqualified from the presidential contest . Rights groups and reporters say the run-up to the vote has been marked by a climate of repression, with verified reports of enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings that rights monitors say created fear among voters . Observers and activists have questioned the competitiveness of the contest and raised concerns about the exclusion of leading challengers, which supporters of the president argue is tied to enforcement of the law and preservation of stability .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/CWJSCLTqhz5-w-UpTVMeFFFj9izi6uIyNIsXOWseEi-ZhAukXKTd5FbLsz0sXu5piT8YX-ZnfXJRlsO-HRPQGId5RQ07zvPDcoX_fclmfXg0CnfdNm7Ighk-HdeEoU6gGkCpF8yGOUpr8Aojm2LQcOFmA1EL1Rh2163tERHEK9_FmuwmbVqXrCkLPJNao0A3H_Tb' alt='Voters queue at a polling station on opening day of Tanzania&#x27;s general election' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Opposition excluded: Two of the country&#x27;s leading opposition parties and their main presidential challengers were barred from the race or faced legal restrictions, leaving Hassan without major rivals in practice .</li><li>Low turnout reported: Several outlets reported low voter turnout at polling stations on opening day, with some voters saying they stayed home because of fear of violence or retaliation .</li><li>Verified abuses: Amnesty International and local investigations verified cases of enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and alleged extrajudicial killings in the run-up to the election .</li><li>Call for peace: Religious leaders across denominations publicly urged citizens to &#x27;turn out in large numbers to vote peacefully&#x27;, framing stability as both a civic and spiritual duty for the day .</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Ruling party / government: The ruling party is presenting the election as a continuation of stability and governance after long-term incumbency, framing the vote as a mandate to continue existing policies .
