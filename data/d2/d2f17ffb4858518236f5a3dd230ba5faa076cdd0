<p id="p2">Black Friday deals started very early this year, and we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground on the MacStories Deals <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@MacStoriesDeals" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/macstoriesdeals.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a> accounts since publishing our <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/our-top-amazon-early-black-friday-picks/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early Black Friday Picks</a>. A lot of those deals are ongoing, so it&rsquo;s worth revisiting that story as you start your holiday shopping in earnest.</p>
<p id="p3">However, today, I wanted to hit the highlights of what we&rsquo;ve covered over the past week on MacStories Deals and add some new deals to the mix that you probably haven&rsquo;t seen yet, so buckle up, it&rsquo;s time to go shopping.</p>
<h2 id="macstories-pixel-icons">MacStories Pixel Icons</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/001/2020-06-04-17-18-39.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p5">All three <a href="https://www.macstories.net/pixel/" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacStories Pixel Icon sets are 40% off</a> until Monday, December 1.</p>
<p id="p6">Two of the icon sets are specially-designed for Shortcuts. We&rsquo;ve all been there. You work hard on a shortcut and want to give it the perfect icon, only to realize that Apple doesn&rsquo;t offer what you want in the Shortcuts app. The MacStories Pixel Icons fill that gap with an extensive set of painstakingly hand-crafted icons with multiple color options created by MacStories&rsquo; long-time designer, <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@silvia" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silvia Gatta</a>. We also offer a set of Perspective icons that are perfect for OmniFocus Pro and other uses.</p>
<p id="p7"><a href="https://www.macstories.net/pixel/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit our dedicated MacStories Pixel page today</a> to preview all three icon sets and purchase them for 40% off until Monday, December 1.</p>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3M9ZNLm" rel="noopener noreferrer">AirTags 4-Pack</a></li>
</ul><p id="p10">There are a lot of Black Friday deals on Apple hardware, but most of them are good, not great. I&rsquo;m picky, so I&rsquo;m only going to focus on just the great deals.</p>
<p id="p11">One of the best deals on Apple hardware during Black Friday is the M4&nbsp;13&rdquo; MacBook Air with 16GB of memory and 256GB of storage. If you want more memory or storage than that, you&rsquo;ll have to settle for a smaller percentage discount, but even with more memory and more storage, you&rsquo;re still doing better than any other deal this year. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3Xnyqjl" rel="noopener noreferrer">15&rdquo; M4 MacBook Air</a> with 16GB of memory and a 256GB SSD is a good deal, too.</p>
<p id="p12">Among the many iPad deals, the best is on <a href="https://amzn.to/4rrqsn1" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 128GB iPad mini</a> with an A17 Pro chip. I&rsquo;ve had a mini since they were released and love it. The size makes it an excellent reading and video-watching device.</p>
<p id="p13">AirPods 4 are also heavily discounted for Black Friday. Apple&rsquo;s most affordable wireless earbuds come with active noise cancellation and without. <a href="https://amzn.to/4itZRlk" rel="noopener noreferrer">The model with no active noise cancellation</a> slightly edges out <a href="https://amzn.to/4iruvfc" rel="noopener noreferrer">the model with ANC</a> as far as the discounts are concerned, but both models are a bargain.</p>
<p id="p14">However, the very best deals available from Apple in terms of the percentage discount are <a href="https://amzn.to/3M9ZNLm" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 4-pack of AirTags</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/4okGA76" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Apple Pencil Pro</a>. If you need either, now is the perfect time to buy them.</p>

<ul id="ul16"><li><a href="https://amzn.to/44e4ZnC" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aqara FP2 Presence Sensor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3XWl5i8" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aqara U100 Smart Lock</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/487xkyy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aqara M3 Home Hub</a> </li>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3XTe01N" rel="noopener noreferrer">Narwal Freo X10 Pro</a></li>
</ul><p id="p17">The holiday season is a great time to catch up on projects and start new ones. For me, that&rsquo;s often tuning up my smart home setup and setting up some new devices thanks to Black Friday sales. Here are the best ones I&rsquo;ve seen:</p>
<p id="p18">Aqara already makes some of the most affordable smart home devices out there, so you really can&rsquo;t go wrong with their Black Friday deals. One of my favorites is the <a href="https://amzn.to/44e4ZnC" rel="noopener noreferrer">FP2 Presence Sensor</a>. It&rsquo;s far more sophisticated than a simple motion sensor. To start with, it can tell when you&rsquo;ve left a room, which motion sensors can&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;ve used an FP2 Sensor in my office to control lighting for a couple of years, <a href="https://club.macstories.net/posts/presence-based-automations-with-the-aqara-fp2" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote about it for Club members</a>, and have been really happy with it.</p>
<p id="p19">Other great deals from Aqara include its <a href="https://amzn.to/3XWl5i8" rel="noopener noreferrer">U100 Smart Lock</a> that works with Apple Home Key and HomeKit, the <a href="https://amzn.to/487xkyy" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aqara M3 Home Hub</a> that I recently set up at home and love, and <a href="https://amzn.to/4iAnrgf" rel="noopener noreferrer">4MP Camera Hub G5 Pro</a>, an outdoor HomeKit camera that <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/rugged-reliable-and-homekit-ready-a-review-of-aqaras-g5-pro-outdoor-camera-hub/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I reviewed earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p id="p20">My Aqara 4MP Camera Hub G5 Pro is paired with an <a href="https://amzn.to/4pzsWht" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecobee Smart Video Doorbell</a>, which is also on sale for Black Friday. I&rsquo;ve used various Ecobee smart home products for years and have never been disappointed. The same goes for its smart doorbell. I&rsquo;ve had it installed for over a year, and it&rsquo;s been reliable despite facing the sun on some very hot summer days.</p>
<p id="p21">Black Friday is also a great time to buy a robot vacuum and mop. There are lots of deals, but the model I&rsquo;ve tested for the past couple of months and love is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3XTe01N" rel="noopener noreferrer">Narwal Freo X10 Pro</a>. It handles vacuuming and mopping, navigating via LiDAR and does an excellent job compared to other robot vacuums I&rsquo;ve tried. I&rsquo;ll be reviewing the Freo X10 Pro about it soon, but now&rsquo;s the time to get it at a steep discount.</p>

<ul id="ul24"><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Ktn7mP" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anker SOLIX C1000 Gen 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pj5Nj4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anker SOLIX C300</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4p7S6Ea" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anker 27,650mAh Prime Power Bank</a></li>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/44n3408" rel="noopener noreferrer">UGREEN 300W Nexode Charging Station</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4rpiRp7" rel="noopener noreferrer">UGREEN 500W Nexode Charging Station</a></li>
</ul><p id="p25">I&rsquo;ve had the first generation <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ktn7mP" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anker SOLIX C1000 battery</a> since August, and it&rsquo;s a great backup system in the event the power goes out. In fact, its 1,024Wh capacity is enough to keep my entire Mac setup running for around seven hours. It&rsquo;s big and heavy, but with five standard U.S. wall outlets, two 140W USB-C ports, a 123W USB-A, and a 15W USB-C port, the C1000 is a versatile backup battery.</p>
<p id="p26">One of the early Black Friday deals I picked up for myself was <a href="https://amzn.to/4pj5Nj4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anker&rsquo;s SOLIX C300</a>. It&rsquo;s deeply discounted and strikes a great balance between energy storage and size storing 288Wh of energy (which is the equivalent of nine 10,000mAh battery packs) in a package that&rsquo;s just under 8 inches tall and 5 inches wide and deep. We have variable rate pricing on electricity where I live, so I&rsquo;ve been charging the C300 when electricity is cheap and charging all my devices when it&rsquo;s not. The capacity is enough to charge my MacBook Pro and have plenty left over for my iPhone, and anything else that needs a charge. It has a light and a car charger, too.</p>
<p id="p27">If that&rsquo;s too much battery for you, <a href="https://amzn.to/4p7S6Ea" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anker&rsquo;s 27,650mAh Prime Power Bank</a>, which is an excellent Black Friday deal option, too. The battery can output 250W total and has three ports: two USB-C and one USB-A. I&rsquo;ve used this battery for a couple of years, and what I like most about it is that it comes with a magnetic base that charges at 170W, recharging it fully in around 37 minutes. The base has two USB-C and one USB-A port, so it can serve as a wall-powered charging hub, too.</p>
<p id="p28">If batteries aren&rsquo;t your thing, UGREEN has some excellent deals on wall chargers ranging from <a href="https://amzn.to/4adtwNp" rel="noopener noreferrer">the compact Nexode 200W GaN wall charger</a> that outputs 200W total and has four USB-C and 1 USB-A port to <a href="https://amzn.to/4rpiRp7" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 500W Nexode charging station</a> with five USB-C ports, a single USB-A port, and a single USB-C port output of up to 240W. In between is <a href="https://amzn.to/44n3408" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 300W Nexode charging station</a> with four USB-C ports and one USB-A port. All three are deeply discounted for Black Friday and are a great way to charge multiple devices simultaneously.</p>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pv8fTN" rel="noopener noreferrer">XReal One Pro glasses</a></li>
</ul><p id="p34">Oura is new to Amazon, and the company is making a splash with a big discount on <a href="https://amzn.to/4ik1eTq" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Oura Ring 4</a>, the latest version of the sleep and fitness tracking ring. If a smart watch isn&rsquo;t your thing, the Oura Ring 4 is an excellent alternative way to get the benefits of heart rate and sleep tracking.</p>
<p id="p35">AR glasses continue to improve, allowing you to use your computer, watch TV and movies, and play games on a huge virtual display. One of the leaders among the companies developing AR glasses is XReal, whose glasses Federico and I have both used. For Black Friday, XReal is offering a great deal on <a href="https://amzn.to/4p7UU4f" rel="noopener noreferrer">the XReal One glasses</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/4pv8fTN" rel="noopener noreferrer">smaller discount on the Pro model</a>, both of which could make for a fun holiday season AR project.</p>

</ul><p id="p38">I spend <em>a lot</em> of time researching the latest gaming hardware for <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPC: Next Portable Console</a>, and there are some great deals out there this year. One of the most exciting announcements in gaming this year is that Valve is releasing a Steam Machine early next year &ndash; a sort of more powerful Steam Deck designed to be connected to your TV.</p>
<p id="p39">One of the most intriguing aspects of Valve&rsquo;s plans that we discuss on <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">next week&rsquo;s episode of NPC</a> is that the beta version of its operating system, SteamOS, has already been adapted to run on some desktops. That means it&rsquo;s already possible to configure a PC with specs that are as good or better than a Steam Machine today. If that&rsquo;s your sort of thing, one of the most interesting options is the <a href="https://amzn.to/49FsVnB" rel="noopener noreferrer">GMKtec AI Mini PC Ryzen Al Max+ 395</a>, a mini PC with a footprint that&rsquo;s similar to a Mac Studio, but shorter. With specs that beat what Valve has said about the Steam Machine, this mini PC is a great option for experimentation, which I&rsquo;d pair with an <a href="https://amzn.to/4rrkaDV" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASUS ROG Swift 32&rdquo; 4K OLED Gaming Monitor</a>, one of the most highly-rated OLED gaming displays to be released this year. Both it and the GMKtec mini PC are heavily discounted for Black Friday.</p>
<p id="p40">You don&rsquo;t see deals on <a href="https://amzn.to/4ols9Q6" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Sony PS5 console</a> very often, but Amazon has a good deal right now on the slim edition with built-in drive. At this point in the current generation of consoles, Sony&rsquo;s PS5 has an excellent catalog of games, making this an excellent Black Friday deal if you&rsquo;ve been waiting for the best time to buy a PS5.</p>
<p id="p41">A lot of great controllers are on sale for Black Friday, too. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ul id="ul42"><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4olnkGI" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony DualSense</a></li>
