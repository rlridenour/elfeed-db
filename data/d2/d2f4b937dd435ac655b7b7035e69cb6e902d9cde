</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A reflection on a book that I feel connected to something deep within me.  One that I found very accessible and enjoyable for its unfolding mystery and reverence.
</p>
        <p>In <time datetime="2025-06" title="2025-06">June</time> I wrote:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

Learned about <cite data-id="55a32435-c012-4892-be9a-ac00b5b17204">Piranesi</cite> in <a href="https://writingslowly.com/2025/06/09/a-search-for-meaning-in.html">A search for meaning in the palace of lost memories:
Thoughts on Piranesi, a novel by Susanna Clarke</a>; and am very much interested.
It turns out, I had already owned the book.  So now I’ve started reading it.

</blockquote>

<p>I had thought that I picked up <cite data-id="55a32435-c012-4892-be9a-ac00b5b17204">Piranesi</cite> on a work trip to St Louis, but that
couldn’t have been, as that trip was before COVID—<cite data-id="55a32435-c012-4892-be9a-ac00b5b17204">Piranesi</cite>’s publication date is
<time datetime="2020-09" title="2020-09">September 2020</time>.  From where and when might I have acquired this book?</p>
<p>When I buy a book from a bookstore, I often will grab one of their bookmarks or
put the receipt of purchase into the book.  But when I started, I didn’t see
that slip.  Perhaps I had purchased multiple books at the time I bought this
one?  Yet why does St Loius resonate as the place.</p>
<p>I think again.  Now remembering that I have twice in recent times been to St
Louis for a work conference.  The second time being DigiPress in 2023; one in
which I was a speaker.  That was when I worked at Scientist.com.  I have notes
from the conference proceedings.  ButI don’t have journal entries from that
time, yet I remember the emptiness of St Louis.</p>
<p>The incorporated city with that singular arch, amidst tall buildings and urban
infrastructure.  St Louis purportedly with an expected capacity of a million;
yet only 200,000 lived within the city.  Streets of city central felt empty; I
could walk blocks without seeing a car in motion or another person.  Stone
edifice everywhere: the bones and remains of something once more “alive.”</p>
<p>I can now place myself in the bookstore where I got <cite data-id="55a32435-c012-4892-be9a-ac00b5b17204">Piranesi</cite>.  It is different
from the one than I’d first thought.  The conference had wrapped, or was I there
a day early?  Regardless I had an afternoon (or morning) of time; I had already
visited the grand and sweeping main library branch.  And as is my traveling
custom, I took to public transit to find my way to a book store.</p>
<p>As habit demands I moved through the bookshelves: essays, poetry, then
other…always in that order.  I picked out a few books including <cite data-id="50B95D43-857F-4ABB-8944-9B74FB392A22">Nettle and Bone</cite> by T. Kingfisher…or memory is a tricky thing had I just started that and
was sharing about it with the shopkeeper?</p>
<p>No.  That book, <cite data-id="50B95D43-857F-4ABB-8944-9B74FB392A22">Nettle and Bone</cite> was one that I purchased there…I think.  Yes.
There, as I have memories of chatting with the shopkeeper, and of her
noting that and what else I’d picked up.</p>
<p>I pause, my memories and my writing disagree.  I had two or more books in hand
and was looking at the shelf of “blind dates with a book”; a book wrapped in
heavy paper with a few words teasing at its nature.  Normally I skip out on
those, but the description of one intrigued me.  However it read as though it
could’ve been one of the books in hand.</p>
<p>I asked the shopkeeper if what I had in had might also be the wrapped one, as I
wanted to avoid buying a duplicate.  She remembered, describing and wrapping
that one and was mostly confident, she thought, that it was not a duplicate of
what I had in hand.  I remember laughing with her and saying <em>If it is a
duplicate, I guess I’ll have a gift for someone.</em></p>
<p>With purchase in hand, I must’ve put the receipt in one of the non-wrapped
books.  That is what I do.</p>
<p>I remember reading <cite data-id="50B95D43-857F-4ABB-8944-9B74FB392A22">Nettle and Bone</cite> in my hotel room in St Louis; a concrete
room with touches of warm hardwood, and a sturdy early 20th century desk; I
almost wrote early century, but I’m in the 21st century, by reckonings of most.
There I was in a boutique hotel so very large; with long concrete corridors and
many floors.  Much as the city, mostly empty—another world meant for so many
more.</p>
<p>I don’t recall whether I opened that wrapped book there or when I got home.  It
must be <cite data-id="55a32435-c012-4892-be9a-ac00b5b17204">Piranesi</cite>, but I suppose what was wrapped may be another, as I have no
memory of unwrapping it.  My habit of trying to keep crisp corners leans me to
assume I kept it wrapped; in part to keep it protected.  That wrapped book was
one that melted into the scattered piles of books at our old house.</p>
<p>That was one of two bookstores I visited in St Louis.  Now confident the one of
<cite data-id="50B95D43-857F-4ABB-8944-9B74FB392A22">Nettle and Bone</cite> I visited at the beginning of the trip.  As there was another
bookstore I went to in St Louis; this time I know that I had luggage in tow, as
I was making my way to the airport for a late afternoon flight.  At that
bookshop, in a part of St Louis there were more people, apparently supporting
urban infrastructure of a large medical facility.</p>
<p>I drifted amongst the shelves, essays, poetry, then elsewhere, knowing I’d
rather spend time at a bookstore than waiting in an airport.  It was absurd that
I had been obligated to fly to St Louis, as my company said driving the five
hours or so would be an unacceptable liability.  To fly from South Bend to
Atlanta then St Louis had felt absurd.  At least this return flight which I
would get to after the bookstore was from St Louis to Chicago and then South
Bend.  More as a crow might fly.</p>
<p>I found a book that I failed to purchase that day: <cite data-id="41C6B231-FC1E-4DB7-8E80-75C1D30CC6F3">Several Short Sentences about Writing</cite> by Verlyn Klinkenborg.  The title, the sentences there within,
captured my imagination.  At that moment, I hadn’t yet established a questing
list.  Two years later, I would create one, and consult it as I drift through
libraries and used stacks.</p>
<p>More bizarre, in this corner of St Louis, I overheard a shopkeeper talking with
a customer.  The customer was wanting to buy some Christmas gifts; it was
mid-November after all.  Not all that strange, but the conversation turned
curious: “I’m from out of town and the people for whom I’m shopping appreciate
when I buy from local businesses.”</p>
<p>The shopkeeper responded, “We appreciate you buying local, you said out of town,
where is that?”</p>
<p>“Goshen, Indiana,” replied the woman, “We just moved there.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but interject, this was a place I knew and lived.  “You said
Goshen?  I’m from there as well.  And you’ll want to checkout Soapy Gnome.”</p>
<p>I remember a tinge of guilt of trying to soft-pitch a sale in another person’s
store.</p>
<p>“Oh we love that place.  Before we moved, we visited quite often,” she said.</p>
<p>“My wife’s the owner of the store.  I’m Jeremy Friesen.”</p>
<p>“Oh my,” she replied as a memory must’ve surfaced, “I knew you years ago…at
least our parents knew each other and I know of you.”</p>
<p>A random connection in a city two states away from our home.  We talked a bit
more, I now forget her name, though remember her parents.  For a few recent
years her father and mother visited with my mother; but alas her father’s mind
has been ravaged and he spends his days in memory care.  Her father, a man with
a connection to me and the scare on my chin; one that I remember only in stories
told to me.</p>
<p>In Kansas, when I was younger, before my memories took root, I was pedaling
along on a tricycle.  With a rope tied to the neck and running underneath the
frame.  This man, as playful fathers of that era did, played a prank.  He
stepped on the rope.  The result being partially unexpected…the taught rope
pulled down on the neck of the tricycle, and I flipped over the handle bars.
Scraping my chin on the concrete.  Later, this man would build us a LEGO table
that we kept for years on end; one perfect and eternal in my memories.</p>
<p>I think the surprise of the conversation, and memories that flooded me both now
and then, redirected me away from <cite data-id="41C6B231-FC1E-4DB7-8E80-75C1D30CC6F3">Several Short Sentences about Writing</cite>.
Perhaps I left it unpurchased as another touchstone for this memory of
coincidence?</p>
<p>But I’ve digressed before I’ve even got started.</p>
<h1 id="heading-into-spoilers">Heading into Spoilers</h1>
<p><cite data-id="55a32435-c012-4892-be9a-ac00b5b17204">Piranesi</cite>, what should I say?  This is a story of memory and becoming and of
ritual and reverence.  To say much more is to spoil the story.  But dear reader,
you are here after a meandering so spoilers; at least in theme, seem acceptable.</p>
<p>Still here?</p>
<p>The titular character is one of two known Occupants in a massive House; them and
the Other.  Piranesi Reveres the House as Provider of All.  Living
impoverished amidst the Statues of the Myriad of Rooms.  Each Room many hundreds
of meters in size.</p>
<p>This is a place where we come to learn that Ancient Memory of our world Drains.
Oceans flood the Lower Level; which perhaps alludes the myths of our world’s
Great Flood that spans many cultures.</p>
<p>Clarke tells the story of <cite data-id="55a32435-c012-4892-be9a-ac00b5b17204">Piranesi</cite> through journal entries written by the
titular character.  There’s an early hint that something changed by way of an
early overview of the naming scheme of the journal entries.</p>
<p>As I finished the book, I found myself thinking of a time before I became aware.
I don’t have memories of entering this world.  But do have memories in which I
am now part of the world.  Piranesi accepts the nature of the House, much as I
accept the nature, physics and proportions and weather, of this natural world.</p>
<p>He has embraced the House, and accepted its nature, finding that the House
provides all that he needs.  Yet I, reading his journals see the absolute
squalor and oddity of his life.  In the House he has found the remains of
thirteen people, whom Piranesi has named (e.g. Biscuit-box man) and whom all he
tends and honors.</p>
<p>Early Piranesi writes of the Other, the one other living person they’ve seen in
the house.  They write with a reverence and trust for their friend the Other;
but what they write hints early that the Other holds them prisoner in the House.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I enjoyed <cite data-id="55a32435-c012-4892-be9a-ac00b5b17204">Piranesi</cite> by Susanna Clarke; I find myself these past few days
thinking on this book.  Clarke’s constructed surreal House feels as real as any
dream I’ve had.  In fact, writing this Concluding Section, the House stirs a
memory in me.</p>
<p>As a child I had a recurring dream that frightened me.  There was large room of
rough hewn stone in which everything was far too big.  Piranesi noted in his
journal—the steps were twice the height of what he considered a comfortable
step.  I moved through that room, then felt myself pulled to the gate outside a
small rural cottage, I remember noting the white lace curtains.</p>
<p>I felt scared of both places, yet more so of the dread as the dream pulled to
and fro between between those two locations.  In that stone room, I recall rough
hewn large stone men, I then thought them workers, recalling them as unmoving.
As a child, all would have felt too large for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps that recently recovered memory is what subconsciously pulled me further
into the story.  And why I worked to write this out.  Realizing the fallacy of
memory, and writing this in part as fixity against a Deluvian event.</p>
<p>Clarke has tapped into symbols and imagery of an Ancient World opening that
curious crack in questioning: where do forgotten memories go?  Who were we
before we emerged into this world?  What rejuventation might we find in myth and
memory?</p>
