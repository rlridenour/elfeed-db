Supercharging status updates will begin automatically, as soon as your charging session begins, according to the release notes for the latest version of the Tesla app.<br/>
<br/>
Within the Live Activity widget on the Lock Screen, you can view your Tesla vehicle's current battery percentage, the time remaining until the charging session is completed, the charging output in kilowatts, and more. You can also view the charging time remaining at a glance in the Dynamic Island on newer iPhone models.<br/>
