<p>Friend of the site Todd Vaziri with <a href="https://fxrant.blogspot.com/2025/04/the-movie-mistake-mystery-from-revenge.html">another amazing post, years in the making</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Movies are handmade, and just like any other art form, sometimes the seams that hold movies together become visible to the audience. For movie fans, these moments are very exciting. Catching a glimpse behind the scenes is an exhilarating experience. My favorite kind of “movie mistake” is the kind that is hiding in plain sight… but the casual viewer missed it upon first viewing. Or perhaps even the second viewing, or even the third.
