<p>In the latest development in Gaza’s border access, Israel says the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt is set to reopen on Monday, allowing limited movement after being largely closed for months amid the war. The initial plan centers on medical-related travel, with international monitoring and tight security measures described by multiple outlets. For Gazans needing treatment outside the territory, the partial reopening offers a small but meaningful pathway to care, though reports describe strict limits and uncertainty about who qualifies and how lists will be managed. The move comes as the ceasefire process is reported to be moving forward, even as violence has continued in recent days, underscoring how fragile day-to-day conditions remain.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qCdnLS7ZCniLEiIYf6PWBkeB2E2fShakXVin74qgZZMXc_SeNdpZikehRcZKd8kpRXSufxy99fimUCwoBSvqquxdkw_g2b98N5aZ4FIRHDsWZt0PH1mzWctOdTEtFJU5L8d-PJfuTGrEZ0q4Vt3lvZZ4uUAqg_5ouSRDB0Yie4WwmDm8vozMkloaqaQ-boFGRR19WJY_2wNDbGVyfq1TqZhPsVB5QsoA7P-kJIjwXaIYoA' alt='View of the Rafah border area near Gaza’s crossing with Egypt.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Daily operating window: Rafah is expected to run on a restricted schedule of about six hours per day under the reported plan.</li><li>Patient cap: Early operations are expected to prioritize a small cohort of medical cases, with reports citing a limit of about 150 patients per day exiting to Egypt for treatment.</li><li>Pilot phase: Israel has framed the reopening as a test or “pilot” step, with only a small number of people allowed to cross at first.</li><li>Criteria confusion: Families and patients have faced unclear eligibility rules and limited slots, leaving some people unsure whether they will be permitted to travel even with urgent needs.</li><li>Ceasefire context: The planned reopening is reported alongside a ceasefire that outlets say is still progressing, despite reports of deadly Israeli strikes in the preceding day.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israel (government/military authorities): Israel says the Rafah crossing will reopen for limited travel, emphasizing controlled access and a staged approach to resuming movement.
