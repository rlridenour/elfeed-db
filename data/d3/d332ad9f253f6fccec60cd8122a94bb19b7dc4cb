</ul><h1>Betwixt Foot and Shoe</h1><p>Alright, time for a little story from my actual life.</p>
<p>You know how there are some people who, for reasons of fashion or personal comfort or whatever, go through the entire summer in jeans?</p>
<p>That’s not me.</p>
<p>When the temperature ticks above sixty degrees for three days in a row in April, the shorts come out, and they stay at the forefront of my wardrobe until fall arrives and the temperature drops into the mid-fifties.</p>
<p>I like to give my arms and legs some air. Also, my toes. I’ve got a nice pair of sandals with good arch support, and those serve as my primary footwear for basically half the year.</p>
<p>The other half?</p>
<p>Well, that brings me to a few days ago.</p>
<p>My previous pair of closed-toed shoes had, by the spring, degraded to such a degree that they were no longer fit for going out in public. Hence, they retired to the countryside. Which is to say: they became my lawn mowing shoes.</p>
<p>Thus, with the fall looming, I needed a new pair. And, since my old preferred style had been discontinued, I needed to go somewhere I could try some things on. So, I set off for the mall, wearing my sandals, and bringing with me a pair of socks to put on when I got there.</p>
<p>At least, that was the plan. In practice, the socks didn’t make it further than the little table by the door to the garage, where I put them down to grab my wallet and keys and never picked them back up.</p>
<p>But no bother, right? After all, my sock drawer could probably use a bit of a refresh, too. Why not avoid the weird bootie things they offer, buy a pack of socks at the store, use a pair to try on shoes, and bring the rest home?</p>
<p>But then, I saw, to my delight, single pairs of socks for sale! And from a company I had heard advertised often on podcasts! Certainly, this would be the most economically sound option, right?</p>
<p>WRONG!</p>
<p>Because each pair–as in, two socks–was FIFTEEN DOLLARS!</p>
<p>Today, we are selling a twelve-pack of socks for three dollars more than that. Are they as good as the socks I saw at the mall? Probably not. But, on the other hand (or foot?), they are, at the end of the day, socks. A little bit of compression, a little bit of stretch, “heat-release technology.” Whatever that means. What I’m getting at is that I doubt they’re twelve times worse.</p>
<p>Which is all to say, you may look at this sale and think, <em>I don’t need socks right now.</em> But you will at some point. And when you do, you might be shocked at how much socks cost these days.</p>
<p>So maybe just invest in some new socks now while they’re cheap.</p>
