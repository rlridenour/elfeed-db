  About Me
  <a class="anchor" href="#about-me">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Ashton Wiersdorf, and I&rsquo;m a PhD student at the <a href="https://utah.edu/">University of Utah</a> studying programming languages with <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/bgreenma/">Ben Greenman</a>. I live in Salt Lake City, Utah. Outside of academia I have worked as a software engineer, mostly focused on back-end development.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sung with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choirs_at_Brigham_Young_University">BYU Men&rsquo;s Chorus</a> and I play the piano. Other hobbies include swimming and hiking&mdash;Utah has some of the most diverse landscape anywhere in the US: from dense forests to barren desert. If you visit, I highly recommend checking out some of the national parks.</p>
<p>I served a two-year mission for the <a href="https://churchofjesuschrist.org">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> in Germany. Consequently, I speak fluent German and have a great appetite for German food. My wife and I were able to visit Berlin for a few months in 2019. If you&rsquo;re interested in visiting Europe, Berlin is a must.</p>
<p>This blog is primarily where I&rsquo;ll post about research, school, and programming. I&rsquo;m studying programming languages, though my interests are not strictly constrained to any one field. I like literature and philosophy, so there will be the occasional book review that I&rsquo;ll post under my <a href="https://lambdaland.org/posts/personal/">personal section</a>. I change my mind a lot; I&rsquo;m still learning, so things written here should not be understood as an immutable reflection of my opinions.</p>

<p>This blog is built by <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, and the theme is a modified version of <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/">hugo-book</a>. The body font is <a href="https://mbtype.com/fonts/valkyrie/">Valkyrie</a>, the headings are <a href="https://mbtype.com/fonts/hermes-maia">Hermes Maia</a>, and the monospace font is a personal customization of Iosevka that I call <a href="https://codeberg.org/ashton314/iosevka-output">Iosevka Output</a>. This blog is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>For analytics I use <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">Goat Counter</a> which doesn&rsquo;t track any personal data. It&rsquo;s basically just a way for me to see what&rsquo;s popular and what&rsquo;s not and so I can tell if something hits the front page of HN when I wasn&rsquo;t looking.</p>
<p>I write my blog in <a href="https://emacs.org">Emacs</a>. I use <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">ox-hugo</a> to export from org-mode to Hugo-friendly Markdown. I used to use Hugo&rsquo;s built-in org-mode handler, but it messed things up like apostrophes and didn&rsquo;t handle some other formatting as I wanted it to. The ox-hugo library does a much better job.</p>
<p>This is the third iteration of my blog style. Previously I&rsquo;ve run blogs with Ghost and Jekyll. I moved to Jekyll from Ghost because I wanted a lighter-weight static site, and I moved from Jekyll to Hugo for the lovely themes and some of the more advanced capabilities it offers.</p>
