<p>About 16 minutes <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/channels-with-peter-kafka/id1080467174">into the podcast</a> (the whole thing is a great succinct interview):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Kafka:</strong> You said Fortnite is going to come back to iOS. You
guys were kicked off the platform in 2020 for violating Apple’s
rules. There’s nothing in the judge’s ruling that says Apple has
to reinstate Fortnite on iOS. Have you talked to Apple? How do you
imagine Fortnite will come back to iOS?</p>

<p><strong>Sweeney:</strong> Epic has a valid [Apple] developer account in good
standing. Our subsidiary Epic Games Sweden opened up an account in
order to distribute Fortnite in the European Union. Our dealings
with Apple on that account have been managed by their developer
relations team, who have been cordial.</p>

<p><strong>Kafka:</strong> Do you feel confident that I will be able to play
Fortnite on my iPhone later this week?</p>

<p><strong>Sweeney:</strong> I believe so. I would be very surprised — well, I
wouldn’t be terribly surprised if we had a bug that took a day or
two more to fix — but I would be very surprised if Apple decided
to brave the geopolitical storm of blocking a major app from iOS.</p>

<p>We’ve told Apple what we’re doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Apple has, for the last five years, already blocked a major game — Fortnite — from iOS. If Apple were going to allow Fortnite back into the App Store they could have done so at any point in the last four years. And there’s nothing, not a word, in Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers’s decision last week that says Apple needs to reinstate Epic Games. I think Apple just stays the course and Fortnite remains <em>persona non grata</em> as far as the App Store is concerned.</p>

<p>But I could be wrong. <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1919111157249458650">Sweeney tweeted over the weekend</a> “Not Monday or Tuesday. Beyond that, we’re working as hard as possible and aren’t certain what day it will be ready.”</p>

<p>Me, I’m not holding my breath.</p>
