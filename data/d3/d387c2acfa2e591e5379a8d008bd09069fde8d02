<p>Hundreds of Danish veterans and supporters marched in Copenhagen to the U.S. Embassy to protest remarks by President Trump that veterans and allies said diminished European contributions during the Afghanistan war. Several reports described the demonstration as a silent march and framed it as part of a broader wave of anti-American gatherings in Denmark linked to recent U.S.-Denmark tensions. Protesters emphasized Denmark’s combat role alongside U.S. forces in Afghanistan and the country’s losses there, saying the comments felt like an insult to those who served. Some coverage also tied the anger to White House rhetoric about Greenland and the territory’s right to self-determination, underscoring how alliance politics and respect for service can shape public trust between partners.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/E8HA5vHm1n6i5RbniVqHtgYgsD_5E9OZd0H_3TeiNgAIw5yOnUTwuJQuvPdtUPYOy0VHrmtLvMpFry8hZjY-E6fhLMYle97zPz_YZrV9fchVxbJkwo-GdSi2bsmmLVNvQ3oCz-3hwX73XXpOZ3SS3tWm6nDKpy6y6TgPBzfxlROJ3rMYNPSGFg8y3AQMA1txVS-QKzUn5WawR-Y-l6fpgUMPEIsXiGP25PWHDA' alt='Danish military veterans and their families marching in Copenhagen on Saturday in protest of recent comments by President Trump.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Afghanistan losses: Denmark lost 44 service members in Afghanistan, a per-capita death toll described as on par with the United States, which protesters cited as evidence of Denmark’s frontline role.</li><li>Embassy focus: The rally took place outside the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen, with coverage describing it as a silent protest by veterans and supporters.</li><li>Greenland issue: CBS reported veterans said White House rhetoric disregarded Greenland’s right to self-determination, adding a second grievance beyond the Afghanistan comments.</li><li>Alliance tensions: DW said tensions have remained high between the NATO allies amid President Trump’s push to acquire Greenland, a backdrop to the march.</li><li>Veterans’ message: The New York Times described the event as the latest anti-American gathering in Denmark, led by veterans who previously fought alongside U.S. troops and now sought public recognition of that shared service.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Danish veterans and supporters: Organizers and participants said President Trump’s comments about allies being &#x27;off the front lines&#x27; in Afghanistan insulted those who served and risked minimizing Denmark’s sacrifices.
