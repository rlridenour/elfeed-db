<p>This year, we did not go away when I booked my annual leave. It was a decision that arose out of a combination of not wanting to leave our elderly cat in a cattery, the fact that I was so exhausted from ME fatigue that I felt the work involved in <em>going somewhere</em> on holiday might be counter-productive, but also &mdash; if I&rsquo;m honest &mdash; the fact that neither of us got things together sufficiently to book anywhere.</p>
<p>Never mind. A change of scenery might have been nice, but the opportunity to potter around and rest was very welcome. We did go out for a couple of day trips which were lovely, but much of the time I immersed myself in hobbies: my favourite things. This post will be about the fibre hobbies (sewing and knitting), and the next will be about changes I have made to my Linux setup.</p>

<p>If you are on Mastodon, you may have seen me post photos of this knitting project early in the process. If you do remember it, you have a great memory, because &mdash; checks notes &mdash; I started this pattern more than 18 months ago. I had already missed one autumn/winter opportunity to wear the finished object, so I was determined that I would not remain un-pullovered through another winter.</p>
<p>As an aside, I dithered over what to call this style of sleeveless knitwear. As a child in the 1970s, they would be referred to as &lsquo;pullovers&rsquo; or &rsquo;tank tops&rsquo;, but &lsquo;vests&rsquo; seems to be more popular now. However, in the US, &lsquo;vest&rsquo; more often seems to refer to a suit waistcoat, where we in the UK tend to think of a vest as a sleeveless cotton jersey garment you wear to work out in or (if you are of an older generation) an undergarment under a dress shirt. Language is such a slippery thing. I will stick with pullover.</p>

<p>The pattern is the <a href="https://www.shopkdd.com/sweaters-and-cardigans/argyll-argyle---mooring-club-yarn-pack">Argyll::Argyle pattern</a> by Kate Davies Designs using West Yorkshire Spinners <a href="https://wyspinners.com/products/fleece-bluefaced-leicester-dk-yarn?variant=49344417923340">Fleece Bluefaced Leicester DK</a>, and it was a very enjoyable knit. The length of time it took me was to do with my slow pace of knitting, and the fact that it was the first &lsquo;proper&rsquo; garment I have ever knitted, and I was determined not to mess it up. I never really stopped knitting it for long periods, but doing only a little at a time, it progressed slowly.</p>
<p>There were a few tricky parts, but once I had got the hang of the twisted stitches, and had knitted enough to see how the pattern repeated, I found it required enough concentration to be absorbing, but not so much that it was a chore. It&rsquo;s a very nicely written pattern, and I found it fairly easy to follow the chart version of the instructions, even as a novice, though I kept forgetting that I needed to work the even rows left to right when working the back and forth portions of the front and back. The instructions suggest placing markers at the start of the row and the halfway point (so where the side seams would be if there were any), but I am glad that I followed the suggestions of reviewers on Ravelry to place a marker at the start of each repeat. This did mean that my knitting was positively festooned with markers, but it made it so much less stressful to keep track of where I was, and I only had to count a maximum of 18 stitches to figure out where I was on the chart. I could also put the work down mid-row and easily pick it up again, without getting lost, which was useful on the initial body section where you are working all stitches in the round.</p>

<p>I am frankly astounded (and quite proud) that it turned out as well as it did. I&rsquo;m glad that I resisted my natural urge to dive straight into a project and instead knitted two gauge swatches, as my first was a little off-gauge. The swatches also helped me to practice the pattern stitches in a low-stakes situation. I must have ended up bang on gauge as the pullover blocked very naturally to the indicated dimensions at the end, and &mdash; weighing the leftover yarn &mdash; I used very close to the indicated weight of yarn. Better still, it fits perfectly. I did worry at one point that it might be a bit long in the body, but the length in the end was just right for me.</p>
<p>Sadly, I can&rsquo;t wear it without melting at the moment in the crazy heatwave temperatures we are experiencing in the UK, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to wearing it proudly as soon as the weather cools.</p>
<h3 id="the-franken-patterned-jenna-dress">The franken-patterned Jenna dress</h3>
<p>Earlier this year, I found a long, linen-mix summer dress in a charity shop and bought it with the intention to either wear it as it was or use the copious fabric of the skirt to make a top or something else out of. I don&rsquo;t buy many garments new these days (mostly &rsquo;technical&rsquo; clothing for walking or field work), but I do sometimes look in charity shops when I&rsquo;m in need of something basic but boring to make, or to find something I can up-cycle. For both I try to find clothing that is made of good quality fabric, preferably with natural fibres, and often something oversized so that I have scope to re-fashion it.</p>

<p>I really liked the bold print on this dress and the ankle length (on me) swishy skirt, and the linen mix fabric was lovely and soft but substantial. I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of the bodice of the dress though. I don&rsquo;t generally like sleeveless tops on me, and this also had a plunging neckline that isn&rsquo;t my thing. So the dress hung in my wardrobe while I thought about what to do with it.</p>
<p>When I was planning my holiday sewing projects, I decided to make one (or maybe two?) <a href="https://closetcorepatterns.com/products/jenna-button-up-shirt-shirtdress-pattern?variant=40460280168582">Jenna Shirts</a>, by Closet Core Patterns. This is a deliberately oversized, boxy shirt with cool, &lsquo;borrowing menswear&rsquo; feel about it. Given that I have much less spare energy for sewing (or anything else) now, I try to plan a set of coordinating garments rather than one-off pieces. My long term plan was to make a couple of Jenna shirts in different fabrics, a pair (or two) of <a href="https://closetcorepatterns.com/collections/sewing-patterns-all/products/mitchell-trousers-pattern?variant=39910257787014">Mitchell trousers</a> (also Closet Core Patterns), and top them off with my Argyll pullover for a relaxed &lsquo;Diane Keaton in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/diane-keaton-annie-hall-fashion-1235128587/">Annie Hall</a>&rsquo; feel.</p>
<p>I bought two lengths of different linen mixes for the shirts (I have learned that I much prefer a soft and slightly drapey fabric for shirting, rather than a crisp cotton), and some gorgeous deadstock wool suiting for the trousers in a tiny charcoal houndstooth check. However, as I looked at the pattern, I suddenly realised that the shirtdress view of Jenna that I had previously ignored would probably work beautifully as the bodice of my charity shop dress. As a bonus, it would also effectively be a wearable muslin or toile for me to check the fit of the shirt. I could see that the loose, relaxed fit of the shirt bodice on that very full skirt would be much more my cup of tea (and a better balanced silhouette on my form) than the very fitted sleeveless bodice on the original. I measured up the lower hem of the Jenna bodice and the circumference of the dress skirt and realised it would fit very well with only minimal gathering.</p>
<p>I found some absolutely gorgeous linen mix fabric (I think mixed with Tencel, but it could have been viscose) at <a href="https://guthrie-ghani.co.uk">Guthrie &amp; Ghani</a>, which was a soft black that matched very well with the slightly faded black background of the skirt. The new fabric was much more drapey than that of the skirt, but otherwise they were a good match in terms of weight and body.</p>

<p>I wish I could explain how delicious this fabric is. I do buy fabric online quite a bit, but the thing you miss out on is how the fabric feels. This is <em>so</em> soft, both in surface texture and in the way it drapes in soft folds with a little bit of &lsquo;body&rsquo;. It was lovely off the bolt, and just as fabulous after a pre-wash. Sewing can be a tactile pleasure as well as an engaging problem-solving activity, and this fabric was so lovely to work with. Sewing black thread on black fabric isn&rsquo;t easy if you have to rip any stitches out, and sewing the tower plackets neatly with such drapey fabric wasn&rsquo;t ideal, but I regret nothing. The end result is a joy to wear.</p>
<p>I took my time with it. I used to rush through projects to finish them, but with my chronic fatigue, I need to take frequent breaks now. Perversely, that seems to encourage me to invest more time in getting the details right, hand sewing some parts if I think I will get a neater finish. The one thing I was concerned about with the bodice fabric was weather the viscose element of the fabric would make it &lsquo;grow&rsquo; (i.e. stretch) vertically with the weight of the full skirt attached. It also naturally frays quite a bit, so I wanted the seams to be as strong as possible. I therefore flat-felled all the seams, including the armhole and sleeve seams, which I was quite proud of, so it is a completely clean finish inside. The skirt seam was too bulky for that, but I bound that with bias tape for extra strength. To my delight, the skirt seam already had nicely finished, large in-seam pockets, and French seams on the side seams, and of course it was already hemmed, so that saved a lot of work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already worn it to work a couple of times, and got some nice reactions, partly because I rarely wear a dress, so it is a bit of a change in style. Despite the fact that it is outside my normal style, I felt comfortable and confident, and really appreciated the airyness of the dress on the scorching days we have been having. The shirt/bodice part has some lovely details, and for once the collar came together very neatly. The sleeves are a bit long for me (not a problem for this dress, as I can wear with the sleeves rolled up anyway), but I will shorten the sleeve pattern by a good 4-5 cm when I make the shirt versions later. The rest of the pattern was spot on for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still got two more shirts and the Mitchell trousers to make, but I have the fabrics and bits and bobs I need for all of them, so I will work on them slowly over the coming weeks.</p>
