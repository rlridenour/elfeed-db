<li>Finally, a way to make hummus during a power outage</li>
<li>No electricity required, just pull the cord and chop</li>
<li>They look cute</li>
<li>Are they available in Georgia Red: Sort of, but there’s blue on there too</li>
</ul><h1>A Cut Above</h1><p>We recently moved into a new home. The house is a bit bigger, but the yard is a bit smaller, a bit flatter, a bit less private, and fewer exciting birds come through.</p>
<p>Do I miss our old yard?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>But one thing’s nice: this one is much easier to mow. In fact, it’s so easy that when our self-propelled gas mower broke down, we went out and got a base-level electric mower to replace it. And boy is it nice. No more stinking like exhaust after doing yard work. What’s more, no more cord yanking. Push a button, pull back a bar, and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Of course, there are downsides to this. What if the muscles I use to pull cords atrophy and die to the point that I can’t even turn on the overhead lights in the basement?</p>
<p>That’s why I need one of these things. No more yanking cords to chop grass; now I can yank cords to chop onions.</p>
<p>But look, <a href="https://meh.com/forum/topics/2-pack-kuhn-rikon-2-cup-pull-chops-with-gift-boxes">last time we sold these</a>, people were divided in terms of durability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I got a version of this a few months ago and it didn’t take too long for me to break it. The cord no longer retracted back into the lid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/@goldnectar">@goldnectar</a> also had issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good thing you get two because all my pull chops ended up breaking. They’re neat when they work, though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="/@tinkertime">@tinkertime</a>, who first ordered one of these in 2019, has found them very reliable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have one of these as well, I’ve had mine for years. I use it to make egg salad, deviled eggs, and any time I need to chop up veggies. I find it easy to clean and I try to make sure to not get the rope wet. The blades are super sharp, so be careful when handling. Usually a friend will see it and think it is the best thing since sliced bread so I have bought them as gifts, so I just picked up a set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, maybe they’ll break? Maybe they won’t?</p>
<p>But, like goldnectar said, you get two for $12. In other words: worth a shot, right?</p>
