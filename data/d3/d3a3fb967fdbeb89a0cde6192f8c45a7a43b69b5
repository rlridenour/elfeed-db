<p><a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12880">Irreal likes Ramírez’s Journelly</a>. To each their own, sure, but after I read the review he mentioned, I&rsquo;ve been scratching my head a bit. I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Irreal is a dedicated Emacs user, and I estimate he uses more Emacs in his day-to-day functions than I do - so why does he feel the need to use something that is <em>not</em> Emacs for quick notes?</p>
<p>One of my theories is iPhone usage. That&rsquo;s probably a big one. Using org-mode on an iPhone is not easy. There&rsquo;s Beorg, but it&rsquo;s geared more toward task lists and calendars than taking notes (even though you can do that, especially if you have templates). Even better, you could include a timestamp every time you record a new note, which is one of <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12842">Irreal&rsquo;s needs</a> of his requirements. I&rsquo;m not sure if he wants to include voice recordings or dictate notes on his iPhone, but both of these things are pretty easy to do - exporting an audio note and attaching it to a header in org-mode is pretty straightforward and can probably be automated.</p>
<p>My issue with any such apps, especially if they&rsquo;re meant to capture &ldquo;everything&rdquo; (like pictures, short videos, oral notes, etc.), is that pretty soon they start competing with org-mode. What follows is confusion about what I put where which is usually followed by a short burnout of using either one. Then I have a period when I don&rsquo;t save anything, and I regret it later.</p>
<p>org-mode is not perfect, but as long as I use it, I have one place where I know I can find whatever I need. At work, I usually keep detailed notes of what I did under each header with timestamps, even if they are just a few lines long. It&rsquo;s more than just recording information: the act of writing clears up my head and helps me figure out what goes next, and the &ldquo;emotional memory&rdquo; (for lack of a better term) reflected in the mood of my notes helps me remember things later that I didn&rsquo;t think of actually writing down. I can find old records this way, even if they happened years ago.</p>
<p>As I already said, to each their own. We all get to choose what tools we want to use. This is not about preaching; it&rsquo;s just that his use case makes me put my Emacs thinking hat on and think about what I would do. These scenarios are interesting to solve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to write him an email or comment, but I can&rsquo;t find an email address, and the blog&rsquo;s commenting system uses Disqus, which doesn&rsquo;t let me log in with any accounts I want to use. Oh well. Maybe he will find this post.</p>
