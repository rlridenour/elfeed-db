Over at the Emacs subreddit, surveypoodle asks a perennial question: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1kkmcwc/best_keyboard_for_emacs/">what are the best keyboards for Emacs?</a> He points out that Emacs pinky seems to have appeared rather late in the editor&rsquo;s history and speculates that that&rsquo;s because the keyboards originally used with Emacs were better suited for it than modern keyboards that make many of the bindings awkward. He&rsquo;s asking what <i>modern</i> keyboards are best for dealing with RSI.

If you&rsquo;re interested in an answer to the question, see the comments to surveypoodle&rsquo;s post. There are all sorts of suggestions. Reading through them, I realized that I didn&rsquo;t care.

I used to yearn for a reincarnation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard">Space Cadet keyboard</a>—okay, I <i>still</i> have some vestigial urges—but I realized that these days I do virtually all my work on my laptop. I&rsquo;m guessing the same is true many of us. Regardless, the use of a laptop pretty much makes the choice of a keyboard for you. Sure, you can use a third party keyboard but unless you&rsquo;re always working at (the same) desk it&rsquo;s just too much trouble. As I&rsquo;ve said before, I do a lot of my work on the couch so an external keyboard isn&rsquo;t a practical choice for me.

What to do? As much as it has become a cliche, Emacs pinky—or more generally Emacs induced RSI—is a real thing.The best solution I&rsquo;ve found is some simple keyboard modifications. I&rsquo;m using a MacBook Pro so keyboard firmware modifications aren&rsquo;t an option. What I can do, though, is arrange for the modifier keys I use the most to be easy to reach. Two of those, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Hyper</kbd> are, configurable from within Emacs or macOS. The <kbd>Meta</kbd> key is bound to <kbd>Alt</kbd> by default so there&rsquo;s nothing to do there. What all this means is that binding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to <kbd>caps lock</kbd> and <kbd>Hyper</kbd> to <kbd>⌘ Right Cmd</kbd>, I can use my thumbs for <kbd>Meta</kbd> and <kbd>Hyper</kbd> and that <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is an easy reach for my pinky.

I know that a lot of you are doing the same or similar things. If you&rsquo;ve got a better solution, leave a comment.</p>
