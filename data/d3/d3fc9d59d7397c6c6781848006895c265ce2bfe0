<p>A mass shooting in the small mountain community of Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, left nine people dead, including the suspected shooter, and more than 25 injured, authorities and multiple outlets said. Police said the attack included shootings at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and at a nearby home believed to be connected to the suspect. They added they do not believe there is any ongoing threat to the public. Police identified the suspect as 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar and said she died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators said the suspect killed her mother and stepbrother at a home before going to the school. They have not announced a motive, and they are reviewing the suspect’s past interactions with police and the health system, including mental health-related calls to her home. In the aftermath, the remote town of about 2,400 has leaned on community support. Residents gathered to comfort one another and to begin processing the loss, while leaders including Prime Minister Mark Carney offered condolences and praised first responders.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/BEgEDKqWgFyRpoGy3Cm2iTnJcst0yQWuLvQdIwplFsWzU3j8Df6gH6uUcr3Z9pvDiQg5EpQPBSsQX0WBTLMmwgCesNd1v4xi2WfcH8YUwstY' alt='Video screengrab shows the school building in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, after the shooting (Feb. 10, 2026).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Victims: Police said those killed included a 39-year-old female educator and six children, including several 12-year-olds.</li><li>Firearms detail: RCMP said the suspect had a gun licence, but it expired in 2024.</li><li>Police response: Students and teachers sheltered inside the school for hours during the response, according to accounts cited by The New York Times.</li><li>Local context: Some reports described Tumbler Ridge as a hunting town where gun ownership is common.</li><li>Death-toll clarification: Police later revised the death toll to nine after initially reporting 10.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP): Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald said investigators are reviewing the suspect’s history of mental health-related police contacts.
