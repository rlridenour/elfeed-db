<p>
Sometimes, I need to revert a series of commits that I&#39;ve already pushed, doing a git hard <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset">reset</a> (<code class="verbatim">git reset --hard</code>) is not an option, as someone may already have new commits based on mine.</p>
<p>
For example, assume that I&#39;ve made a few commits like below:</p>
<pre class="example">
65a2c62 * commit 10
25cad43 * commit 9
72ad583 * commit 8
ceebf9a * commit 7
acf8a11 * commit 6
28d526f * commit 5
63af1e2 * commit 4
982c71c * commit 3
0fb4c2d * commit 2
acf9da1 * commit 1
b5f9933 * commit 0
</pre>
<p>
For whatever reason, I need to &#34;drop&#34; the changes made by commit 6 to commit 10, that is, go back to &#34;commit 5&#34; without deleting these commits.</p>
