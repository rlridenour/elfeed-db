There&rsquo;s been a spate of posts lately about navigating among windows in Emacs and <a href="https://olddeuteronomy.github.io">The Emacs Cat</a> decided to jump in with a <a href="https://olddeuteronomy.github.io/post/emacs-window-navigation/">description of their own procedures</a>. I like those procedures because they are essentially the same as mine.
</p>
<p>
Like The Emacs Cat, I use abo-abo&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window">ace-window</a> to switch between windows and I don&rsquo;t understand why anyone would use anything else. The idea is that when it&rsquo;s invoked, ace-window will label each window with a number and you can then switch to any of the windows by typing requisite number. It&rsquo;s easy and fast and after several years I haven&rsquo;t found anything better.
</p>
<p>
Unlike The Cat, I just bind <code>ace-window</code> to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd>. Most of the time it acts exactly like <code>other-window</code> because I typically have two windows open and in that case, <code>ace-winodw</code> simply gives focus to the other window. On those occasions when I have more than two windows open, moving to the correct window is only one additional keystroke. At one time, I also bound <kbd>F8</kbd> to <code>ace-window</code> so I could switch windows even faster but I found I never used it.

<p>
I also use
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp"><span style="color: #483d8b;">:config</span> (custom-set-faces
     '(aw-leading-char-face
       ((t (<span style="color: #483d8b;">:inherit</span> ace-jump-face-foreground <span style="color: #483d8b;">:height</span> 3.0)))))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
in my <code>use-package</code> definition for <code>ace-window</code> so that the numbers on the windows are bigger.
</p>
<p>
Take it from The Emacs Cat and me. You really should be using <code>ace-window</code> to handle window navigation. It&rsquo;s the best there is.</p>
