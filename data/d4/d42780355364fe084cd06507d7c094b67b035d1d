The new feature analyzes real-time workout data alongside users' fitness history—including heart rate, pace, distance, and Activity rings—to deliver personalized motivational insights during exercise sessions. A custom text-to-speech model converts these insights into dynamic audio coaching using voice data from Fitness+ trainers. Workout Buddy processes this data privately and securely with Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
The feature requires Bluetooth headphones and an Apple Intelligence-supported iPhone nearby. Initial support covers popular workout types including Outdoor and Indoor Run, Outdoor and Indoor Walk, Outdoor Cycle, HIIT, and Functional and Traditional Strength Training.<br/>
Workout Buddy launches in English first, with additional languages expected later.<br/>
<br/>
Workout Buddy is included in iOS 26 and watchOS 26, which will be released to the public in the fall. Beta testing is available starting today.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wwdc-2025/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/ai-powered-workout-buddy-coming-to-apple-watch/">Apple Unveils AI-Powered &#039;Workout Buddy&#039; for Apple Watch at WWDC</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-unveils-ai-powered-workout-buddy-for-apple-watch-at-wwdc.2458440/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
