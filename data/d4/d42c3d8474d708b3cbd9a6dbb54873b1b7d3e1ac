</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Reflecting on mornings as the days stretch longer.
</p>
        <p>Our bedroom window faces south east.  At our latitude as we approach the
northern hemisphere’s summer solstice, sunlight begins creeping in around 6 am.
Enough to wake Lacey (our 3 year old border collie).  She insists on going
outside.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Ollie (our 11 year old border collie) follows; he stretches a bit
to ease his stiffness.  They go out for a bit as I blearily wait; thinking I
might rejoin sleep for a bit.</p>
<p>Often I can sleep another hour or so.  But not always.  Then, as the morning sun
intensifies, Lacey again pulls me awake.  I get dressed, gather their leashes,
and Lacey, Ollie, and I all head out for a 20 minute walk.  They sniff and mark a
now familiar circuit.</p>
<p>The walk is something new.  At our previous place, the road in front of our yard
was a rural through-way for quite a lot of traffic.  I never considered walking
the dogs along that road, in part because I didn’t want to establish that the
road was a place for them to go.</p>
<p>Now, stepping out onto the road of our new house, I am on a rural cul-de-sac;
which connects to a state road but that is a couple hundred yards away.  So we
have this quiet roadway on which to walk; perhaps a quarter mile for the
complete circuit.</p>
<p>As I walk, all of my tiredness leaves; the dogs and I are out and about.  I
wouldn’t mind getting up at 6am if it weren’t for another change.  My partner
and I are staying up rather late.  Mostly watching a show or two after working
in the yard in the evening.  Here and <time datetime="2025-05-30" title="2025-05-30">now</time>, it gets dark around 10pm, so that
evening work can go as late as 9pm.</p>
<p>Now back from the walk, I feed the dogs and myself, put on a pot of coffee, and
then clean-up.  I pull out my computer and read through my <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">Rich Site Summary</a></span> (<abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" title="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-RSS">&#128214;</a></small>)
 feed; I’ve
curated a cross-section of my interests.  There’s investigative journalism along
with a myriad of personal blogs: literature, tech, gaming, and simply humans
being human writing about their lives.</p>
<p>As I’m reading, I might write a bit in my personal journal.  I don’t consider
myself a morning person, but compared to my partner, I’m very much the early
riser.</p>
<p>As the coffee finishes brewing, I’ll pour a cup for myself and partner;
delivering her a cup of coffee in bed.  She has recently closed her brick and
mortar store, and is reclaiming time for herself.  For a decade she had worked
12 hours or more a day, six or seven days a week for her business.  She’s earned
some rest and recovery.</p>
<p>And a morning cup of coffee in bed is a gesture I like to make.</p>
<p>About an hour separates the beginning of the walk from me wrapping up reading
and writing.  An hour, about the same as a past commute into work.  I feel a
richness and completeness that I wish were available for others.  And know that
this ability to work from home remains precarious.</p>
<p>I wish I could bring myself to read books in the morning, but that remains a
struggle; in part because I have long habitualized that I should wake up, get
ready for, and then go to work.  And reading doesn’t sit within that habit.
Whereas opening my computer and pulling down my news does.</p>
<p>Now, if I could bring myself to accept waking at 6am, I’m certain I could then
start reading for a half-hour or so.  Something to consider, but that would mean
I’d want to be in bed by 10pm, which is contrary to our current habits and hours
of daylight.</p>
<p>Further, adjustments have been my partner around during the day.  She’s been
gardening, cleaning, baking bread, and sifting through our moved possessions;
gathering to remove duplicates (what we had at home as well as at the store).
This is a welcome adjustment, as I have worked remote and without folks around
since <time datetime="2020-03" title="2020-03">March 2020</time>.</p>
<p>Which means we eat lunch together, and maybe go for another walk as a break from
our responsibilities.  I’ve increased my daily physical exercise, not just in
walking, but also in gardening.  My wife has been removing the landscaping
stones from the flower beds; and I’ve been carting them away to our gravel
driveway.  I’ve also moved several yards of wood chips from last <time datetime="2024" title="2024">year</time>’s felled
trees.</p>
<p>At the hyper local level, life is good.  A lot more baking and cooking,
harvesting lettuce from our garden, and tending to our local food sources.</p>
