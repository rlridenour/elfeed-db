<blockquote><p>
Another mistake there may be in the Picture of our first Parents, who after the manner of their posterity are both delineated with a Navel. &#8230; Which notwithstanding cannot be allowed, &#8230; that in the first and most accomplished piece, the Creator affected superfluities, or ordained parts without use or office.</p>
<p>&#8230; Now the Navel being a part, not precedent, but subsequent unto generation, nativity or parturition, it cannot be well imagined at the creation or extraordinary formation of Adam, who immediately issued from the Artifice of God; nor also that of Eve, who was not solemnly begotten, but suddenly framed, and anomalously proceeded from Adam.
