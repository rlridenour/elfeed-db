<blockquote>
  <p>A macOS app that enhances control over Elgato lights, offering
features beyond the standard Elgato Control Center software.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<li>Automatically turn lights on and off based on camera activity</li>
<li>Turn lights off when locking your Mac</li>
<li>Sync light temperature with macOS Night Shift</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Lolgato also lets you set global hotkeys for toggling the lights and changing their brightness.</p>

<p>I’ve had a pair of <a href="https://www.elgato.com/ww/en/p/key-light?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block">Elgato Key Lights</a> down at my podcast recording desk for years now. Elgato’s shitty software drove me nuts. Nothing seemed to work so I gave up on controlling my lights from software. I set the color temperature and brightness the way I wanted it (which you have to do via software) and then after that, I just turned them off and on using the physical switches on the lights.</p>

<p>I forget how I discovered Lolgato, but I installed back on November 10. I connected Lolgato to my lights, and set it to turn them on whenever the Mac wakes up, and off whenever the Mac goes to sleep. It has worked perfectly for over two months. Perfect little utility.</p>
