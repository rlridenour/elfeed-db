I receive an error when something somewhere crashed, and couldn&rsquo;t get my mail into emacs Gnus with the following error:
 movemail: mailbox `/var/spool/mail/webdevtory&rsquo;: cannot lock: Conflict with previous locker (1 return). Continue? (y or n)
 Continuing was useless (didn&rsquo;t show my new mail), restarting the whole machine didn&rsquo;t work. So just go to the directory and delete the .lock file in there. Back to health.
