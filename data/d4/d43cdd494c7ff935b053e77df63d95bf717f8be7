<blockquote>
  <p>CBS News entered a new period of turmoil on Tuesday after the
executive producer of “60 Minutes,” Bill Owens, said he would
resign from the long-running Sunday news program, citing
encroachments on his journalistic independence. [...]</p>

<p>“It’s clear the company is done with me,” Mr. Owens said,
according to a recording that was obtained by The Times. The
correspondents Lesley Stahl and Scott Pelley were in attendance — Ms. Stahl choked up as she praised Mr. Owens, and noted that he
had “taken a hell of a beating” — and Anderson Cooper dialed in
from Rome, where he was covering Pope Francis’ death for CNN.</p>

<p>During the meeting, Mr. Owens alluded to his displeasure with
additional layers of oversight that CBS executives had placed on
the program. “In a million years, the corporation didn’t know what
was coming up — they trusted ‘60 Minutes’ to report the stories
and program the broadcast the way ‘60 Minutes’ saw fit,” he said.
Any change to that arrangement, he added, created “a really
slippery slope.”</p>

<p>Mr. Owens also discouraged his staff from quitting in protest. “I
do think this will be a moment for the corporation to take a hard
look at itself and its relationship with us,” he said.</p>

<p>Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, is eager to
secure the Trump administration’s approval for a
multibillion-dollar sale of her company to Skydance, a company run
by the son of the tech billionaire Larry Ellison. She has
expressed a desire to settle Mr. Trump’s case, which stems from
what the president has called a deceptively edited interview in
October with Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on “60
Minutes.”</p>

<p>Legal experts have dismissed that suit as baseless and
far-fetched. Many journalists at CBS News — the former home of
Walter Cronkite and Mike Wallace — believe that a settlement
would amount to a capitulation to Mr. Trump over what they
consider standard-issue gripes about editorial judgment.</p>
