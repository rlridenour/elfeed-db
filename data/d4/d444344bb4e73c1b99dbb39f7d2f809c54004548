It&rsquo;s Sunday and nobody—especially me—feels like working so here&rsquo;s a short interlude while we&rsquo;re waiting for the new week to begin. The subject of today&rsquo;s post falls in the broad category of what could be called &ldquo;mobile Emacs&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Most of us have wished for a way to take Emacs with us when we&rsquo;re out and about. Certainly, no one would want to do any serious editing on a smart phone—although Po Lu <i>has</i> produced <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/936576/">an Android port</a>—but it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine using it on an iPad or other powerful tablet.
</p>
<p>
Then there&rsquo;s this guy who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1o9m0oh/how_to_use_emacs_on_the_go/">literally wears his computer complete with a heads up display</a> so that he always has access to his Emacs. When I saw the video, I immediately thought of Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s gargoyles from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash">Snow Crash</a>. It&rsquo;s the exact same idea: people wearing computers—and looking odd—so they can stay continuously connected to the metaverse or what we in this world call &ldquo;the net&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
As much as some of us would like to be permanently connected, I doubt that many of us are prepared to embrace the solution suggested in the video. Of course, I could be wrong and it&rsquo;s just what people are looking for. Let us know what you think.</p>
