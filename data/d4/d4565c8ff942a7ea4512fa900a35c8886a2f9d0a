<blockquote>
  <p>While Hockney is perhaps best known for his larger-than-life
<a href="https://www.myartbroker.com/artist-david-hockney/collection-swimming-pools">swimming pool</a> paintings, bold coloured acrylics are
certainly not his only forte. Contrary to the old saying, Hockney
is a jack of all trades and a master of all he has worked with:
from paint to <a href="https://www.myartbroker.com/artist-david-hockney/series-the-yosemite-suite">iPads</a>. In the late 1980s, his fascination
with technology and new ways of creating art led him to the Xerox
photocopying machine. The copy machine offered Hockney his
speediest technique of printing yet, allowing the artist to build
layers, textures and colours like never before. However, it was
not only a swift and spontaneous way for Hockney to produce his
prints. The tech-savvy artist said that he had a more
“philosophical” interest in the Xerox machine as a new iteration
of the camera.</p>

<p>My post last week arguing that AI is a legitimate tool to create art has, as I expected, generated polarized feedback. One argument several readers have made is that AI generates nothing but <a href="https://www.404media.co/openais-sora-2-copyright-infringement-machine-features-nazi-spongebobs-and-criminal-pikachus/">plagiarism, copyright infringement, and slop</a>. That’s just not true. If a painter as renowned as David Hockney can use a literal photocopier as an artistic tool, AI can be one too.</p>
