<p id="p2"><a href="https://retrododo.com/nintendo-once-produced-game-boy-colors-that-matched-the-apple-imac-g3-range/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retro Dodo</a>, linking to the website <a href="https://consolevariations.com/collectibles/nintendo-game-boy-color-imac-console?ref=retrododo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Console Variations</a>, has a story about the time Nintendo produced variants of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Boy Color</a> that matched the <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/imacg3/" rel="noopener noreferrer">iMac G3</a>. All that seemingly remains of these color-matched Game Boys is the low-resolution image above from a 1999 issue of 64 Dream Magazine because <a href="https://retrododo.com/author/sebastian/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retro Dodo&rsquo;s Sebastian Santabarbara</a> went looking for the handhelds and was unable to find them anywhere online.</p>
<p id="p3">Nintendo wasn&rsquo;t alone in copying the vibrant translucency of the iMac G3. In the late &rsquo;90s it seemed like every consumer product maker did something similar. Most of those products have been lost to time and forgotten, but Nintendo fans are an intrepid bunch. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if these iMac-themed Game Boy Colors turn up in an auction online eventually.</p>
