<p>A New Zealand High Court has sentenced 45-year-old Hakyung (Lee Hak-yung) Lee to life in prison for murdering her two young children in 2018 and concealing their bodies in suitcases stored in a rented storage unit in Auckland. Justice Geoffrey Venning set a minimum non‑parole period of 17 years after a jury earlier found Lee guilty of killing the siblings, who were six and eight at the time. The children’s remains were discovered in 2022 when an unsuspecting family bought the abandoned storage unit at auction and brought the suitcases home, triggering a major police investigation that led to Lee’s arrest in South Korea and extradition to New Zealand. Prosecutors said Lee killed the children months after her husband died of cancer, while the defense argued she suffered from severe mental health problems, but the judge concluded the killings were deliberate and that she continued to benefit from government payments linked to the children after their deaths.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/-aku9WI0unkjRaTg3zBEC4RJPa29M_FglEnYQN0sKs0ihZ8w47EITtCvShPBvKFOYvsHAN9GHtdLKwDKc0BgdBIuw3Zd9O-OKi_9Odg171BIcAE5Z4DEC8V6dpOPLb6w0Y2yGmwVsdLgWvK57OCYSHri5DSZvzPknCYv-RGveg' alt='Police and media gather outside the High Court in Auckland following sentencing in New Zealand&#x27;s so‑called &#x27;suitcase murders&#x27; case.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Victims’ identities: New Zealand authorities have not publicly released the names of the two children, who were described only by their ages at the time of death and their relationship to the offender, in order to protect what remains of their privacy and dignity.</li><li>Storage-unit discovery: The suitcases containing the children’s remains were found by a family who had purchased the contents of an abandoned storage locker at an online auction and took the luggage home before contacting police.</li><li>Extradition from Korea: Lee, a New Zealand citizen originally from South Korea, was arrested in South Korea following an international search and later extradited to New Zealand to stand trial on the murder charges.</li><li>Judge’s reasoning: Justice Geoffrey Venning said the case involved a serious breach of trust because the victims were entirely dependent on their mother, and he highlighted Lee’s later efforts to obtain financial benefits related to the children as an aggravating factor.</li><li>Mental health arguments: During the trial, the defense argued Lee’s mental state deteriorated after her husband’s death from cancer, but the court ultimately found that, despite her difficulties, she understood what she was doing when she killed the children.</li></ul><blockquote>You killed two defenceless children who relied on you to care and protect them. - Justice Geoffrey Venning</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>New Zealand High Court: The sentencing judge emphasized that the killings represented a fundamental betrayal of parental responsibility and that a lengthy non‑parole period was necessary to reflect the gravity of the offending and to deter similar crimes.
