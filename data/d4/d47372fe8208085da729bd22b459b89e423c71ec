BBDB1 is one of those libraries that has been around for so long it would be highly irregular if we weren&rsquo;t talking about Emacs. The size and age of the thing is what originally scared me away from it in favor of org-contacts2, which had the advantage of being orgmode but was deprecated a long time ago. With BBDB you don&rsquo;t usually view the elisp database that lies beneath, instead using its robust interface to interact.
