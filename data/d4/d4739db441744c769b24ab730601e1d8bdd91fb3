For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with GRID Studio to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win one of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. If you're not familiar with <a href="https://gridstudio.cc">GRID Studio</a>, it's a company that takes old, discarded Apple products and turns them into art for Apple fans.<br/>

GRID Studio is <a href="https://gridstudio.cc">hosting a sale this week</a>, and there are special discounts on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 2G and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 pieces, along with a 15 percent discount on everything else. Just enter the promo code PD15 when checking out to get the deal.<br/>
<br/>
The GRID 2G is <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">available for &#36;299</a>, which is &#36;100 off the regular &#36;399 price. The GRID 2G is one of the most popular devices that GRID Studio sells, because it showcases the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple made. It highlights all of the components that were in the original 2007 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, including the curved shell, power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, and ear piece.<br/>

The Grid 5 is <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid(R)-5">available for just &#36;109</a> this week, down from &#36;169. It features the 2012 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5, which was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that was developed under Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and the last &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple CEO Steve Jobs was involved with. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5 is an important part of Apple's history because it included a taller 4-inch display, and it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to use the Lightning port rather than the 30-pin port.<br/>

GRID Studio has a whole range of deconstructed Apple devices, and each one includes all of the components artfully displayed and labeled. A sleek black frame completes the look, and there are interesting details included about each component.<br/>
