<p>John Voorhees of MacStories <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tot-2-0-a-thoughtful-extension-of-an-already-elegant-note-taking-app/">has a review of Tot 2.0</a>, the simple Mac/iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch notes app by The Iconfactory:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  My favorite 2.0 feature is that Tot now supports automatic indenting. If you indent a line using the Tab key, the next line will begin at the same indentation level when you hit Return. That makes creating hierarchical lists a lot faster than before. My only quibble with the feature is that if you’re making a bulleted list, to indent a line, you need to first back up and place your cursor before the bullet, whereas other text editors allow you to indent a line even though the cursor appears after the bullet. Still, it’s an excellent addition that I’m glad to see included in the update.

<p>Tot is a clear concept, delightfully designed, and built for Apple’s platforms with care. I’m glad to see that it’s gotten an update to make it even better.</p>
