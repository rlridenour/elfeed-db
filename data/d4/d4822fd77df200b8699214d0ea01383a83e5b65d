<a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a>, best known for its telemetry-free search engine, has released version 1.0 of <a href="https://orionbrowser.com/">Orion</a>, its privacy-focused browser for Mac. After a long beta period, the WebKit-based browser is aimed at users who want Safari's speed without the data collection that comes with most other options.<br/>

For users who want an alternative to Chromium browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Brave, without sacrificing speed or extension support, Orion could be worth a look. Moreover, unlike some recent browser launches, there's no integration of AI features, and Kagi says it collects no telemetry or usage data of any kind. <br/>
<br/>
For a browser claiming zero-bloat, there are some notable features, too. Focus Mode strips away the browser interface to turn any website into a distraction-free app, while Link Preview lets you peek at links from mail or notes without actually opening a new tab. You can set up separate profiles that keep work, personal browsing, and everything else completely isolated. Not only that, the browser also works with Chrome and Firefox extensions.<br/>
<br/>
Orion is free to download and use, and also comes with 200 free searches on Kagi's premium search engine, while an optional Orion Plus subscription at &#36;5 per month unlocks floating windows that stay on top of other apps, custom icons, and offers early access to new features. <br/>
<br/>
Kagi's six-person team developed Orion over five years (the first two years handled by a single developer). The company plans to expand documentation and add new features over the coming year. You can grab it over on the <a href="https://orionbrowser.com/">Orion website</a>, while iPhone and iPad versions can be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/orion-browser-by-kagi/id1484498200">downloaded from the App Store</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/webkit/">WebKit</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/27/kagi-orion-webkit-based-privacy-browser-mac/">Orion Browser Brings WebKit Speed and Privacy Focus to Mac Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/orion-browser-brings-webkit-speed-and-privacy-focus-to-mac-users.2472044/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
