Digital ID, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> feature that lets U.S. passport holders add their passports to the Wallet app, is coming later in 2025, Apple confirmed today.<br/>

Apple updated the release timing wording of Digital ID on its <a href="https://www.apple.com/os/ios/#footnote-13">iOS 26 features page</a>. "Digital ID will be coming later this year with US passports only," it reads.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to today, the footnote for the feature said "Digital ID will be available in a software update with U.S. passports only," with no associated release timeline.<br/>
<br/>
Curiously, Apple removed the mention of a software update, but in all likelihood, Digital ID will be introduced in an iOS 26.1 or iOS 26.2 update before the end of the year. Apple has already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/apple-seeds-ios-26-1-beta-1/">seeded the first beta</a> of iOS 26.1 to developers and Digital ID support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/ios-26-1-beta-1-features/">is not included</a>, but it could be added later in the beta testing period.<br/>
<br/>
Digital ID builds on driver's license integration in the Wallet app. It allows U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to add their passports to Wallet, with the digital passport able to be used in lieu of a physical passport for domestic travel at TSA checkpoints.<br/>
<br/>
As with state driver's licenses and IDs, Digital IDs will work for age and identity verification in apps, retail store locations, and websites. The option to add a passport to Wallet for use as an ID option will expand digital identification features to many more ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ users in the U.S., but Apple has not mentioned if the feature will eventually expand to other countries.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/23/ios-26-wallet-passport-feature-2025/">Apple Confirms iOS 26 Wallet Passport Feature is Coming in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-ios-26-wallet-passport-feature-is-coming-in-2025.2467285/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
