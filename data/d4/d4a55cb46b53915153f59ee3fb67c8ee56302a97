<p>The recipe for &#8220;Groper, Head and Shoulders Boiled&#8221; in <em>Mrs. Beeton&#8217;s Everyday Cookery</em> (1923) concludes with the warning &#8220;Great care should be taken of the immense gelatinous lips, as these are considered the best part.&#8221; In 1948 <em>New Statesman</em> challenged its readers to invent a recipe with a more disgusting last line. L.G. Udall obliged:</p>
<blockquote><p>
GRILLED GORILLA&#8217;S FOOT</p>
<p>One foot will suffice for each person.</p>
<p>First shave the upper part of the foot and wash in warm water. With a gimlet (for preference as the skin is very hard) bore a number of holes through the thick skin of the under part of the foot. Grease liberally with lard. Grill slowly for about twenty minutes with the under surface <em>downwards</em>. Then turn the foot over and continue to grill steadily. From time to time place a fork on the foot. When it is quite done it will be found that the toes will curl up firmly over the fork, so that it can be lifted up and put on a hot plate. Leave the fork in the toes and serve immediately.
