<p>Last year I read <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-two-best-entry-level-handhelds-are-on-sale">this piece by Brendon Bigley at Wavelengths</a> about two low-cost handheld game emulators:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’d argue the Miyoo Mini Plus is the best handheld for the most people at any price point, as its form factor feels comfortable in the hand while still being a device that fits easily in the pocket. The screen is gorgeous and the bezels are tiny, which gives it a kind of retro-future energy, and the control layout makes sense given its processing power — it’s best for those looking to comfortably play retro games up through around the GBA-era. This means N64, Dreamcast, or above are a bit hit-and-miss, enough so that they’re largely not worth buying the device to play. That said, <a href="https://onionui.github.io/">the custom firmware OnionOS is one of the best user experiences you can find on any device</a>, which makes the act of doing anything on this thing a joy. Don’t get one without <a href="https://onionui.github.io/docs/installation">installing OnionOS</a> as your first move. <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007508375209.html">The Miyoo Mini Plus is available in four colors for around $30</a> before shipping for the next two days on AliExpress.
</p></blockquote>
<p>After reading Bigley’s piece, I bought a <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807322060457.html">Miyoo Mini Plus</a> for something like $30. (As of this writing the price is up to $40.) I followed Bigley’s advice, installed OnionOS, and loaded it up with ROMs I have collected over the years. I gave it to my son for Christmas, and while I don’t know how much he’s using it, I sure enjoyed my two weeks playing favorite old arcade (Joust!) and console (NFL Blitz 2000 for PSX!) games on it. It was comfortable to hold in my hand, the color screen was gorgeous, and I loved the idea that all the video games of my first few decades were available in the palm of my hand.</p>
<p>I mention this all mostly because I wasn’t aware that we’ve reached the point where ultra-low-cost devices can have great screens, good ergonomics, and enough horsepower to emulate a surprising amount of stuff. Even at $40, it would’ve been a great deal. I’m tempted to buy another one for myself.</p>
<p>(Also if you’re a fan of different shapes of handheld, you can probably find one of these devices in that shape. Bigley’s story also recommends the Anbernic RG35XXSP, which is shaped like a Game Boy Advance SP, as is the <a href="https://wavelengths.online/posts/the-miyoo-flip-a-review">Miyoo Flip</a>.)</p>
