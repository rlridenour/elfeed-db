<p>Demolition began Monday on part of the White House&#x27;s East Wing to make way for a new ballroom championed by President Trump [ndtv.com#1][dw.com#1][abc.net.au#1]. The President says the approximately $250 million project will be financed by himself and private donors, not by US taxpayers [dw.com#1][newarab.com#1]. He has also said the addition will be a separate structure designed to respect the historic mansion, while the White House offered no comment on Monday [newarab.com#1]. Images of the work circulated as the President acknowledged construction noise during a White House event [newarab.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/dmiBj-KFgjtzTLbO-fhiOkR8jeSYaYGD4xW2LXJtvGqxfQ8FkwgWIxm9QZD6805uocdBwgqOpPxEagHPGuwC7egup_heLeoduvZQdyarcpg4681bp6lUQ5M6rqAGclEYkKTo-LvT2kBgMMwI-_RohIucB3tOX4Z6-BBv5gxaR5w8tYnE52AULZA6AGDHU7OM1csNjVYayx7MQdcFVq6u0nGQ9biKo-LSmCWsa7UUkD7rZ2LgHFIunrEje4Bp' alt='Onlookers watch crews demolish part of the East Wing facade at the White House.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>East Wing roles: The East Wing traditionally houses the first lady’s offices and a visitor’s entrance that welcomes foreign dignitaries [newarab.com#1][ndtv.com#1].</li><li>Event capacity: Plans describe space for 999 guests, with views of the Washington Monument and a flow starting with cocktails in the East Room [newarab.com#1].</li><li>On-site scenes: AFP journalists observed a mechanical excavator tearing apart part of the East Wing, leaving rubble and steel wires [firstpost.com#1].</li><li>Entryway removal: Crews tore down a large covered entryway and windows as demolition began [bbc.com#1].</li><li>East Wing history: The East Wing was first built in 1902 and a second floor was added in 1942, with several renovations since [mercopress.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>Right behind us, we&#x27;re building a ballroom, - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Deutsche Welle: Describes the ballroom as the biggest addition to the presidential residence in over 100 years.
