<p>Apple has largely tied major revisions of tvOS to the launch of new Apple TV hardware over the years. Since the introduction of Apple TV+, WWDC’s tvOS “features” have largely focused on showcasing sizzle reels of Apple TV+ shows, and very little about tvOS itself. This WWDC gave us a trickle of announcements that don’t seem to align with what I would consider to be the rough spots in the tvOS user experience.</p>
<p>It is possible that Apple is holding back meaningful revisions until they launch an updated Apple TV box this fall. Maybe they’ll even mention the 10th anniversary of tvOS itself, which was unveiled in September of 2015 at the iPhone 6S launch event. Until then, I guess we should reflect on what’s announced, instead of <a href="https://joe-steel.com/2024-06-04-Not-a-WWDC-Wish-List.html">wish lists of what could be</a>.</p>
<h2>Through a glass, darkly</h2>
<p>I’m not going to rip into the design in beta 1. It’s also mostly a conservative evolution of what came before but with highlights on edges. However, Apple has really underscored a very specific part of the interface as working as intended and I will push back on that.</p>
<p>Apple has two kinds of Liquid Glass (Regular and Clear) and Clear is supposed to be used over rich media, like video. The only things that define the existence of the controls are the highlights and brighter/blurry refractions visible through the clear elements.</p>
<figure id="youtube">
<p><video autoplay loop muted playsinline arialabel="A promotional video showing the new, transparent player over a dimmed video with light pulsing through the controls."><source src="https://sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Apple-WWDC25-tvOS-26-updated-design-player-250609.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video></p>
</figure>
<p>Well, gee whiz, aren’t clear glass playback controls going to be difficult to see over video, especially when it’s playing through the controls?</p>
<p>To make the controls easier to discern, Apple applies a dimming layer on everything around the controls, but not on the video visible through the controls. It’s like someone stenciled out aftermarket window tinting.</p>
<p>Apple says this is on purpose in its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/219/?time=854">Meet Liquid Glass</a> WWDC video, when demonstrating playback controls on iOS. In its Newsroom post for tvOS, it says: “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-tv-brings-a-beautiful-redesign-and-enhanced-home-entertainment-experience/#:~:text=tvOS%2026%20is%20designed%20to%20keep%20the%20focus">tvOS 26 is designed to keep the focus on what’s playing so users never miss a moment</a>.”</p>
<p>This is bananas. How is this getting out of the way of the content? You can barely discern the playback timeline and playhead while motion is occurring through the element, which causes it to pulse in a thin strip. What is being achieved here? The playback controls and timeline should be flat. No one is going to feel sad that there’s no glass effect in this one spot, where it serves no practical or artistic purpose other than being a wicked smart shader demo.</p>
<h2>Poster through it</h2>
<p>Another notable change in the interface is the pivot from horizontal thumbnails to portrait-orientation posters. Apple says that this means more tiles can fit on the screen, but that’s only more tiles visible in <em>one</em> row, and it’s only one additional tile over the smallest scale thumbnails (6 posters instead of 5 thumbnails). The older design had thumbnails that matched the aspect ratio of the TV in various sizes so you’d get more rows with fewer titles visible on screen in each row.</p>
<p>To compensate for this difference in aspect ratio, the text that was below or next to the thumbnails is now on top of them. I’ll let readers debate which is more legible, and whether or not the text is always helpful.</p>

<p>This decision pushes content downward. If you want to see what kind of category you’re in the mood for, you will do more scrolling down, which means it will take you longer to count the number of times the TV app recommends you watch “Stick.” Unless you really want to flip through one particular row of the interface one title faster, it’s not really an improvement.</p>
<h2>Used any good profiles lately?</h2>
<p>I’m unclear about the continued push by Apple to get developers to adopt Apple’s user profile system. It really doesn’t provide any benefit to the developers of these large streaming services that need to have their own multi-platform profile systems with personalized content recommendations, and it doesn’t provide substantial benefit to households with <em>shared</em> viewing.</p>
<figure>

Someone had the forethought to include this button in beta 1.<br>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>I have no <em>animosity</em> towards user profile improvements whatsoever, and I do appreciate that on your first boot of tvOS 26 you can say you never want to see the profile switcher. However, system-level user profiles just don’t feel like the area of the TV viewing experience that needs this much attention when compared to other aspects.</p>
<p>If I were being <em>generous</em>, I could hypothesize that this emphasis on user profiles is because there will be some genuine effort put into <a href="https://sixcolors.com/member/2023/08/57-app-icons-and-nothing-good-on/#:~:text=Impersonal%20personalization">personalizing the TV app</a> based on the active user profile.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you still can’t express any kind of preference in “personalized” areas of the interface to mark a recommended show as watched (without first adding each title to your Watch List and then marking it there) nor can you express that you have no interest in a title.</p>
<p>Even if increased personalization is on the horizon, <a href="https://joe-steel.com/2023-10-30-Apps-Are-Now-Flops-Tabs-Are-Now-Sidebars.html#channels-apps">there’s no reason</a> to expect that to work as well as the personalization offered in each streaming app’s own recommendation systems. Such a thing requires developer participation and cooperation with Apple.</p>
<p>Speaking of developer participation…</p>
<h2>Just keep adding single sign-ons until one of them works</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/06/apple-tv-gets-new-siri-capabilities-and-single-sign-on/#:~:text=Single%20Sign%2Don%20for%20Pay%2DTV%20Apps">10th anniversary of Single Sign-On</a> is next year, so we’ll be celebrating this latest attempt a little early. That first attempt used <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/12/apples-new-single-sign-on-feature-needs-an-asterisk/">a convoluted system</a> to recognize your cable provider to authenticate all the individual apps you had that worked with existing subscriptions so you wouldn’t have to sign in. Just 18 months later Apple announced <em>zero</em> sign-on, where if you were on a qualifying provider’s internet network, the apps would authenticate on their own.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that these systems almost immediately became obsolete because they were centered on a business relationship between customers and service providers that was <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/streaming-beats-broadcast-cable-may-2025-tv-use-1236292476/">in quick decline</a>. Apple’s blind spot here was believing that anything not subscribed to via a cable provider would be subscribed to via Apple. Due to Apple’s App Store policies on subscriptions, many streamers have left the App Store behind. That means people have to do little sign-on dances that makes using Apple products as frustrating as cheap streaming hardware.</p>
<p>Instead of repairing its relationships with streamers, it’s providing this very latest sign-on feature, which links accounts via your Apple Account email address… but requires streamers to want to implement it. I hope they do, and I hope it works to make everyone happier.</p>
<h2>Sing out loud, sing out long</h2>
<p>I find myself scratching my head at the announcement regarding using iPhones as microphones to do Apple TV-mediated karaoke.</p>
<p>Look, this feature won’t hurt me, or cause harm to the world—with the possible exception of those within earshot—but it’s such a <em>niche</em> thing to do. I have to imagine that someone took a look at the collection of technologies that Apple had built and realized they could put them together, you know, for fun!</p>
<p>I hope people who use this feature do have fun. But it’s a strangely specific thing to use as a selling point, when there are other use cases for the Apple TV, such as watching television, that might be better places to focus.</p>
<h2>Give me more</h2>
<p>I want tvOS to improve, and am frustrated when another WWDC comes along and the changes are as minor as they were this year. I hold out some hope that there’s more to announce, and it’s being held back on for a new Apple TV hardware announcement. But for now, we’ve got tvOS 26… and it cuts down on information density and creates make see-through timelines.</p>
<p>tvOS needs to sort out the dichotomy between the home screen and the TV app. The current TV app is a mess and needs to be upgraded to support features that Apple has never taken a single pass at, like a <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/02/apple-should-embrace-the-live-tv-grid-fast/">universal live guide</a>. I don’t expect them to be perfect, but it would be nice if we could see that Apple is making an effort. Change is long overdue for a platform that many take for granted. Apple needs to try harder at the TV part of tvOS.</p>
