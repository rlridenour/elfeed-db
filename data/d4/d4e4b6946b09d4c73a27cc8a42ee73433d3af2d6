<p>In the latest development after last week&#x27;s burglary at the Louvre Museum, Paris prosecutors said police arrested suspects on Saturday evening in connection with the theft of crown jewels displayed in the Galerie d&#x27;Apollon . One man was detained while trying to leave France from Charles de Gaulle (Roissy) airport, prosecutors said, and authorities have not yet confirmed the total number of people held . The stolen pieces are valued at about €88 million (roughly $102 million), and officials say the probe is large and active as investigators seek to recover the items and identify all participants .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/IXwgTHMwmRjaUkxw0krYMEo35KRwmH4xmb-CfZ5qu4aoP_B6_uAVROCxEMHqur5luXFPAcqV9N0rkhFcEsgs1pjfUbcqSfUPc4HWqHXpHuUTdHAF86Lmk9AakiUFvWOitu442jmZVPxV3uj7DUr2PJNguw8dGrdwDoCdeNsVG9HWK0JBW-YeK99h3PMt9zskw979HEEDajSoKCo--WCVM8Jf4Y7U9SIpxDk9b09Vv0l2bIolq783K4hyLrqCBypFWis_K-1RLiUDe65g7Q' alt='A police car parked in the courtyard of the Louvre, one week after the robbery, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Investigation scale: Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said more than 100 investigators from the anti‑gang brigade and other units were mobilized to gather evidence and track the culprits .</li><li>Airport arrest: French media reported one suspect, aged about 30, was stopped as he attempted to board a flight to Algeria from Charles de Gaulle airport late on October 25, according to local reporting .</li><li>Security response: The Louvre has moved part of its jewelry collection to a high‑security Bank of France vault with a multi-tonne door and deep underground storage after the theft, according to reports .</li><li>Expert assessment: Art‑theft investigator Arthur Brand told FRANCE 24 he believes the stolen crown jewels are likely still intact and remain in France, given the short time since the burglary .</li><li>Media caution: Prosecutor Beccuau warned that public leaks and hasty disclosures could hinder the inquiry and investigators&#x27; efforts to recover the jewels .</li></ul><blockquote>It is too early to provide any further details. - Laure Beccuau</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Paris prosecutor (Laure Beccuau): Investigators from the Brigade de Répression du Banditisme made arrests and over a hundred investigators have been mobilized, but it is too early to provide further details and premature media disclosures may hinder the probe.
