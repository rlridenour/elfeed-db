</ul><h1>Better Together</h1><p><strong>KitSound Diggit2 Speakers: An FAQ</strong></p>
<p><em>So, it looks like this is a 2-pack of speakers. Can they work in Stereo?</em></p>
<p>Absolutely. These two stylish outdoor speakers can be paired together to provide rich surround sound for all your backyard bashes.</p>
<p><em>Outdoor speakers, you say? But they’re cylindrical. Won’t they roll away on uneven ground?</em></p>
<p>Nope. They have attachable stakes, so you can spike them into the dirt. And, an added bonus: the stakes keep them elevated for clearer sound, whether you’re listening to top forty hits or a history podcast.</p>
<p><em>But will they stand up to the elements?</em></p>
<p>You can count on it. It doesn’t matter if you’re dealing with rain, dust, or sand; these speakers’ weatherproof design makes them a perfect pair for a little time outside or whatever big outdoor adventure you’ve got cooked up.</p>
<p><em>You said these are ‘weatherproof.’ Does that include ALL weather?</em></p>
<p>So, have to be honest, this question feels a little ominous, but as we said above: rain, dust, or sand will not be a prob–</p>
<p><em>What about a sword tornado?</em></p>
<p>Sorry, we’re unfamiliar with this… weather phenomenon.</p>
<p><em>Sword tornado. A tornado full of swords. How is it not self-explanatory?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it just seems hard to understand how such a thing would occur.</p>
<p><em>Simple: tornado goes through a sword store. Picks up all the swords. Are you saying that’s impossible? That sword stores are somehow impervious to wind in a way that other retail establishments are not?</em></p>
<p>No, we would never imply that.</p>
<p><em>Okay, so, answer the question: the ‘weatherproof’ designation–does it include sword tornadoes?</em></p>
<p>We would argue that the sword aspect of the sword tornadoes, such as they exist, would not constitute ‘weather.’</p>
<p><em>So, as long as we de-sword the tornado, you can guarantee these speakers will survive?</em></p>
<p>You know, we think you’re getting a bit pedantic, and we should probably wrap this up.</p>
<p><em>Fine, but one last question: what are you eating under there?</em></p>
<p>Under where?</p>
<p><em>You’re eating underwear?!</em></p>
<p>That bit really doesn’t work in a text format.</p>
