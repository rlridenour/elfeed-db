Viewing the new extended history screen can come in handy when you need to recall when you last spoke with someone. It's also pretty useful when you want to verify a call duration for whatever reason. Here's how to get there.<br/>
<br/>

You'll now see a complete chronological record of every incoming, outgoing, and missed call with that contact, including the date, time, and duration of each conversation. This view can stretch back in time for months or years, depending on how long you've been in touch and how much call history data is stored on your phone.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-see-full-call-history-iphone-contact/">iOS 26: See Your Full Call History With Any iPhone Contact</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-see-your-full-call-history-with-any-iphone-contact.2468688/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
