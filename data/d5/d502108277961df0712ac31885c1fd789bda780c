If you want to draw, sketch, or take notes on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, the Rock Paper Pencil kit is a must have. It's the best way to match the feel of writing on paper, and it makes using an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as a writing surface much more pleasant.<br/>

Rock Paper Pencil is an all-in-one kit that includes a textured screen protector and a special tip that connects to the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. This combination turns the glossy, unnatural feel of writing on an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; into a natural, paper-like experience. Not only does it feel like writing on paper, it <em>sounds</em> like writing on paper, plus you get more control over stroke output because of the friction from the added texture.<br/>

Astropad's screen protector uses NanoCling technology to adhere to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with static cling, and you can put it on and take it off as needed with zero residue on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s display. With the NanoCling technology, the screen protector fits right up against the display of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, providing a flat surface with no ridges or gaps.<br/>

Rock Paper Pencil's tip fits on the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro and other &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models, and it is able to hold up to heavy daily use. It has a wear-resistant copper alloy core with a palladium exterior coating, and the size is equivalent to an 0.7mm ballpoint pen for precision writing and sketching. You get two pencil tips with the kit, along with a protective storage sleeve so you can tuck away the screen protector when you're not using it.<br/>

Available for &#36;45, the Rock Paper Pencil kit is compatible with Apple's new M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models, and it is also compatible with other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models. It works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, the sixth and seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> models, and the 7th-generation and later &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
