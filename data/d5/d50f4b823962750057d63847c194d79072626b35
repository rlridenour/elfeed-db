<p>Now we know that June 9 is the day <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/03/wwdc-2025-is-kicking-off-june-9/">Apple will kick off WWDC 2025</a>. I’ve been covering WWDC since before Steve Jobs came back to Apple, and this year is shaping up to potentially be the most interesting, and certainly most dramatic, version of Apple’s most important event of the year.</p>
<p>If you didn’t know already, WWDC is important for more than just developers. It’s literally Apple’s New Year’s Day, the day that the company rolls out its plans for all of its platforms for the next year. With the impending release of <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2605277/ios-18-4-beta-begins-with-huge-apple-intelligence-expansion-but-no-new-siri.html">iOS 18.4</a>, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html">macOS 15.4</a>, and the rest, we are at the tail end of last year’s cycle. Work at Apple is now shifting even more to the stuff we’ll be using over the next year, beginning with the announcement of new features and new decisions on June 9.</p>
<p>Last year’s event, which featured the rollout of Apple Intelligence—including, yes, some features that never ended up shipping—was certainly dramatic. But at the same time, we all pretty much knew what was coming—Apple was desperate to be seen as a player in the AI game, and so it was going to blow that horn as loud as it could. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2025/03/this-years-wwdc-keynote-will-be-must-see-apple-tv/">This year’s fascination</a> is more subtle: What now? Doubling down on Apple Intelligence? Apologizing for last year’s, er, overexuberant promises? Changing direction? Staying the course? The last year has flipped the table on Apple’s usually conservative and careful platform-building plans. This year’s possibilities are wide open.</p>
