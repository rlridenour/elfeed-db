Joar Von Arndt has an interesting post on a subject that many Emacs users obsess about: <a href="https://joarvarndt.se/eww.html">how to bring Web browser functionality into Emacs</a>. As, I&rsquo;ve said many times, virtually all my tube time is either in Emacs or Safari. I would, of course, like to get that down to just Emacs. To be sure, I <i>do</i> use some other apps but my time with them is basically in the noise. Almost everything I do on the computer involves Emacs or the browser.
</p>
<p>
Von Arndt looks at <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eww.html">eww</a>, <a href="https://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a>, Xwidgets, and <a href="https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework">EAF</a>. He discusses the pros and cons of each. He appears to think that eww—with some customization—is the best solution.
</p>
<p>
My solution is to use Xwidgets for rendering Email posts that need it and for my RSS feed via <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">Elfeed</a>. My email client, <a href="https://github.com/djcb/mu">mu4e</a>, makes it easy to switch between text and HTML rendered displays. It is, in a way, the best of both worlds. I can read most of my emails in plain text, as the elders decreed, but can switch to an HTML rendered display when I need to.
</p>
<p>
I use <a href="https://github.com/fritzgrabo/elfeed-webkit">elfeed-webkit</a> to display my RSS feed with Elfeed. It brings up each entry in a browser like display and, of course, can be easily be toggled on and off. It&rsquo;s a bit fragile, as Von Arndt says, but it easier than invoking the brower for each entry.

<p>
The sad news is that there still isn&rsquo;t a good solution but what solutions there are are getting better. Perhaps we will soon have a way of bringing the final major holdout into the Emacs fold.</p>
