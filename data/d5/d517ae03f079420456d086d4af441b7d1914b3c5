Apple today added Mac Studio models with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips to its online <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/mac-studio">certified refurbished store</a> in the United States, Canada, Japan, Singapore, and many European countries, for the first time since they were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">released in March</a>.<br/>

As usual for refurbished Macs, prices are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent new models on Apple's online store. Note that Apple's refurbished inventory fluctuates often, so check back often for certain configurations.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., refurbished M4 Max configurations starts at &#36;1,699, down from &#36;1,999. The refurbished M3 Ultra configurations start at &#36;3,399, down from &#36;3,999.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to make refurbished MacBook Air models with the M4 chip available anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
The refurbished Mac Studio models ship in a plainer box. Beyond that difference, we consider Apple's refurbished Macs to be virtually indistinguishable from brand new ones, providing a good opportunity for savings directly from Apple. However, you can often find better deals on Macs through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#mac_studio">resellers like Amazon</a>.<br/>

Apple says it puts refurbished Macs through "full functionality testing" and a "thorough cleaning process and inspection," and they are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/refurbished-mac-studio-m4-max-m3-ultra/">Apple Begins Selling Refurbished Mac Studio With M4 Max and M3 Ultra Chips at a Discount</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-refurbished-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra-chips-at-a-discount.2458878/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
