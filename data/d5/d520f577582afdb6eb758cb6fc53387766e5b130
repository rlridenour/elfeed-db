<p>&#8220;We have got to learn to think scientifically, not only about inanimate things, but about ourselves and one another. It is possible to do this.&#8221; &#8212; J.B.S. Haldane</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly all that comes under thy observation in life.&#8221; &#8212; Marcus Aurelius</p>
