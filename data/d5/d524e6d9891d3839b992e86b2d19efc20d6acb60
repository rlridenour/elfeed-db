Apple's upcoming foldable iPhone (or "iPhone Fold") will feature two screens as part of its book-style design, and a Chinese leaker claims to know the resolutions for both of them.<br/>

According to the Weibo-based account <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PncKbfhxx">Digital Chat Station</a>, the inner display, which is approximately 7.76 inches, will use a 2,713 x 1,920 resolution and feature "under-screen camera technology." Meanwhile, the 5.49-inch outer display will use 2,088 x 1,422 resolution, and this screen will allegedly have a punch-hole camera.<br/>
<br/>
Digital Chat Station previously claimed that the inner folding display will have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/28/iphone-foldable-display-ipad-style-aspect-ratio/">4:3 aspect ratio</a>, and they also earlier revealed the alleged <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/">display dimensions</a> of the iPhone Fold. Reputable Apple industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">corroborated</a> these dimensions, additionally describing the inner screen as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">crease-free</a>." However, talk of the device using under-screen camera technology has not been claimed up until now. <br/>
<br/>
That said, rumors have suggested Apple is also working on a foldable iPad, and Digital Chat Station has previously claimed that this device will use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/foldable-ipad-pro-under-display-face-id/">under-display Face ID technology</a>, so it could be that Apple is seeking design parity between the two foldable devices. Additionally, Kuo believes the rear-facing camera on the foldable iPhone will use dual lenses and that the device will forgo Face ID authentication, instead using a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space. <br/>
<br/>
Apple will launch its long-rumored foldable iPhone next year with a ~&#36;2,000 premium price tag attached, expects well-connected <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/"><em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman</a>. According to analyst Jeff Pu, the device recently entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase at Foxconn, with mass production slated to begin in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/">second half of 2026</a>.<br/>

According to Gurman, the device will take advantage of the display, battery, modem, and chip advances that Apple has made in its development of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, which is expected to replace the "Plus" model in Apple's smartphone lineup this year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/">Foldable iPhone Resolutions Leak With Under-Screen Camera Tipped</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-resolutions-leak-with-under-screen-camera-tipped.2455274/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
