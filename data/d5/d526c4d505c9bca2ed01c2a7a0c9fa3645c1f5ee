<p>The US Supreme Court heard arguments over President Trump’s attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, with several justices signalling scepticism about the administration’s position and the potential consequences for the Fed’s independence. A lower-court order currently blocks Cook’s immediate dismissal while her lawsuit proceeds, and the Trump administration asked the justices to lift that order. The case is widely seen as a test of how much control a president can exert over independent agencies, with implications for central bank governance and economic policymaking in the US.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/syL49P3AWVJ8aee2xnoYybxPammV42gvnzNYHtaBSvFaXh88GwERZa7askYVgbMBekDm1RTU1ZSTOb0zuQxTUbwO_-q2tripPJQw3RiMhgdlP9WRlBA_duUlLWqA1F69TgsLaNt816g9T9o1SBK5uDYG1-0t1YKSnVtEYE4rOXL4D83jYyVq_gzX2zdsFYGhbSHW4apAE3VMtL99l6ysoOBW51dOc2xO7eKOEAn-w4k-2jbC3VnD__EbgH0DNevx_Gaz2i3wbuosNsVrGA' alt='Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook and attorney Abbe Lowell arrive at the US Supreme Court on Jan. 21, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Courtroom scene: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was expected to attend the arguments, drawing extra attention to the institutional stakes.</li><li>Legal warning: One conservative justice warned that the White House’s reading of the law could “shatter” Federal Reserve independence.</li><li>Allegations raised: Semafor reports that President Trump’s effort to fire Cook is tied to allegations of mortgage fraud that it describes as unproven.</li><li>Temporary status: The justices’ questioning suggested they were unlikely to allow Cook’s immediate removal while the case continues in lower courts.</li><li>Broader precedent: Coverage notes the dispute could affect a roughly 90-year Supreme Court precedent limiting presidents’ power to remove independent agency officials.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: The administration asked the Supreme Court to lift a judge’s order that prevents President Trump from firing Lisa Cook immediately while her legal challenge continues.
