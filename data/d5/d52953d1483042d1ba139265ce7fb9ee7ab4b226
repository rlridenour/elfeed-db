<p>One of the easiest ways to take advantage of artificial intelligence right now is voice-to-text transcription. I&#8217;ve been dictating to computers for decades, and I can tell you it&#8217;s never been easier than it is now. My weapon of choice for this on my iPhone is <a href="https://whispermemos.com/">Whisper Memos</a>. (The app has in the past sponsored MacSparky, but I was a paying subscriber long before that.)</p>



<p>The developer recently informed me that he was working full-time on his various Whisper-related applications and this change is already paying dividends. A recent update to Whisper Memos adds an auto-summarization feature. So now, in addition to reliably catching your words, you can also get a summary of anything you dictate to the application.</p>



<p>Below is a video that I created for the MacSparky Labs over a year ago, showing how I&#8217;ve combined this application with the action button on my Apple Watch to give me a seamless dictation workflow. I&#8217;m still using it daily.</p>
