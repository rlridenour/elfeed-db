<p>Israel launched airstrikes in southern Gaza on Sunday after saying militants fired an anti-tank missile and gunfire at its troops near Rafah, actions it called a breach of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire [reuters.com#1][bbc.com#1][euronews.com#1]. Hamas denied involvement and said it remains committed to the truce [bbc.com#1][newarab.com#1]. Health officials and media reported varying casualty figures from the renewed violence on Sunday, including at least nine Palestinians killed, with more strikes reported through the day [pbs.org#1][reuters.com#1][theglobeandmail.com#2].

The truce, mediated by President Trump and effective since Oct. 10, included outlines for captive-prisoner exchanges and a roadmap for Gaza; tensions have also risen over returning the remains of deceased hostages, with Israel demanding more handovers and Hamas saying some bodies are still buried under rubble [newarab.com#1][reuters.com#1][nytimes.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/6UOjh2-aHf_bB173kh89o_e_hVSH7TJspPLLr9f2INyXrTPXU5NLiujD2g2JI1T7062VOGWTFFW22yf1B7-XB48oR5xJGWh4wrUCEwZLzEld' alt='Smoke rises following an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, October 19, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Israeli losses: Israeli media and officials reported two IDF soldiers were killed and dozens of Hamas targets struck with over 120 munitions after the alleged attack [theglobeandmail.com#1].</li><li>Targets and areas: Strikes hit Rafah and Khan Younis, with the IDF saying it aimed at tunnel shafts and military structures used for militant activity [euronews.com#1][france24.com#3][politico.eu#1].</li><li>Political pressure: Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir urged a full resumption of military operations, pressuring the coalition as tensions rose [politico.eu#1].</li><li>Aid concerns: The U.N.
