Andrew Huberman suggests organizing your desktop in such a way that you have to look UP at your monitor.  If you have to look down, you may get tired.  He also advises that you should start work about 4-6 hours after you wake to hit your productivity max.

Believe me, I&rsquo;ve tried.

I love &ldquo;productivity hacks,&rdquo;&#x2014;that&rsquo;s largely what my blog is about.  But there&rsquo;s a point at which you must relinquish some control.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes you need to embrace the rough edges of your process and gut things out.  You won&rsquo;t always feel like working on your passion projects.
</p>
<p>
By leaps and bounds sometimes and painful gradations other times, you will work and plod toward something impressive.
</p>
<p>
This is why I often encourage writers in my critique group to favor quantity over quality.  You can be a terrible judge of your own work.  Something you think is brilliant is usually crap.  Conversely, the crap you dashed off without thinking turns out to be spun gold.
</p>
<p>
It can also be hazardous to read about the habits of famous writers you admire.
</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s a massive gap between you and your favorite writer.  If you&rsquo;re not a pro, you&rsquo;re going to be fitting in bouts of writing between your day job, chores, and other responsibilities.  That&rsquo;s just fine&#x2014;as it should be.
</p>
<p>
You&rsquo;re not going to be crushing it all the time.
</p>
<p>
But what about productivity hacks?  Aren&rsquo;t they important?
</p>
<p>
I realized I&rsquo;ve been doing this backward for years.  If you have a day job, like I do, you have to schedule your day around it, so there&rsquo;s no hacking to be done.  Any commitment to prioritizing your passion project will likely be thwarted by some other mundane&#x2014;but important&#x2014;task.
</p>
<p>
Instead of trying to optimize my time spent on a passion project, I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to optimize the time spent on chores and tasks I don&rsquo;t want to do&#x2014;so I can spend fewer minutes a day on them.  This tends to free up the mental space necessary to cogitate on loftier things.
</p>
<p>
Most of the good ideas you&rsquo;ll have for your passion projects tend to come when you&rsquo;re doing something else: laundry, walking, food shopping, pumping gas, etc.
