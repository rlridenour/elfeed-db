<p>My thanks to Copilot Money for sponsoring last week at DF. Copilot is a personal finance app for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and they’ve always deeply believed in the value of embracing the design idioms and technical features of truly native apps for Apple platforms. Apple has noticed, awarding Copilot an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copilot-track-budget-money/id1447330651#productRatings">App Store Editor’s Choice</a> and featuring Copilot earlier this year on Apple Developer <a href="https://developer.apple.com/articles/copilot-money/">for their use of Swift Charts</a>.</p>

<p>Copilot’s big news this month is they’ve launched a new web app, bringing access to Copilot from any device, anywhere. It’s designed with all the attention to detail — and concern for privacy and security — as their native apps.</p>

<p>Copilot Money brings all your spending, budgets, investments, and net worth into one organized dashboard, with intelligent categorization and insights that help you stay on track without spreadsheets or app-hopping. Designed to feel calm and intuitive, Copilot makes it easy to understand your finances across all your devices.</p>

<p>Copilot first sponsored DF back in 2021. My wife and I started using it then to track our finances, and we haven’t looked back. Copilot Money isn’t just better than anything we’d used before, it absolutely blew everything else away. It’s easy to connect to your financial accounts, and once you do, you don’t need to spend any effort at all to enter transactions. Copilot just tracks it all automatically, and most importantly, presents it to you in clear, intuitive ways. It’s so good. I’m not saying that because they sponsored DF last week — I’m saying that as a happy paying customer for over four years now.</p>

<p>Copilot is offering DF readers two months free with code <strong>DARING</strong>, plus 26% off your first year for a limited time, <a href="https://copilot.money/?utm_source=daringfireball&amp;utm_medium=editorial&amp;utm_campaign=daringfireball_122225_web25&amp;utm_term=DARING">available through this link</a>.</p>
