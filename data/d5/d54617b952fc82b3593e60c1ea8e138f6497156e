<p>The United States has seized a large oil tanker, identified by multiple outlets as The Skipper, in international waters off the coast of Venezuela, in one of the most high‑profile maritime enforcement actions of President Trump’s campaign to pressure President Nicolás Maduro’s government. Attorney General Pam Bondi said U.S. agencies executed a seizure warrant because the vessel had been used to transport oil from Venezuela and Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions and to support an illicit shipping network tied to U.S.-designated terrorist organizations. President Trump called it a &quot;very large&quot; tanker and said it was the largest vessel ever seized by the United States, framing the move as part of his broader push to weaken Maduro, who faces narcoterrorism charges in the U.S. Venezuela’s government condemned the operation as &quot;a blatant theft&quot; and &quot;an act of international piracy,&quot; accusing Washington of seeking to &quot;plunder&quot; its oil resources and vowing to defend its sovereignty. The seizure, carried out amid a wider U.S. military build‑up and recent strikes on suspected drug‑trafficking boats in the Caribbean, has raised concerns among some U.S. lawmakers and outside observers that tensions with Caracas could slide toward a wider confrontation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/kGkFB54uG2lG0IrLQsfeDPdNex0GCGl2c8-2wI5aAvlG-37bdmNtAieEAZZdO2dgn_JASpsRNNi9NYgv6FbHpRiVYf5POtZkZBoN1-odSIDwVR8zvCR8yfgrSFpz62LV8s7U-0pVMx5DAuOXLEGXZyoVOfqCpiD0wKCNw8VN0pNwmT_AO34PYmTuF-drGL-Bplt5l2tB1_v4WcF-ZZ97V4xsCamRdMHpVDGUU5a5CwgKQJbjGRFHsG5tqwcMqIlHSI5Ns9_o4NcUUeIStA' alt='U.S. forces abseil onto an oil tanker during the raid off Venezuela’s coast shown in video released by Attorney General Pam Bondi on December 10, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>How raid unfolded: Video released by Attorney General Pam Bondi shows helicopters approaching the tanker and armed personnel in camouflage fast‑roping onto the deck as part of the seizure operation carried out by the Coast Guard with support from other U.S. agencies.</li><li>Ship’s background: Media identified the vessel as The Skipper, a roughly 20‑year‑old Guyana‑flagged tanker previously known as Adisa, which the U.S. sanctioned in 2022 for allegedly helping move oil to Iran and Hezbollah.</li><li>Cargo and destination: Shipping data cited by outlets indicate the tanker left Venezuela’s Puerto José oil terminal around 4–5 December with about 1.1 million barrels of crude, and ABC News reporting referenced by RT said it was bound for Cuba.</li><li>Wider sanctions risk: Analysts told Reuters that more than 30 other Venezuela‑linked tankers already under U.S. sanctions could now face similar enforcement, potentially disrupting shipments and complicating business for shippers and insurers.</li><li>Lawmakers react: In Washington, some members of Congress from both parties questioned the legal basis and risks of using the U.S. military to seize commercial vessels, with one senator warning it &quot;sounds a lot like the beginning of a war&quot; and others demanding briefings on recent maritime strikes and rules of engagement.</li></ul><blockquote>We’ve just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela – a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. administration: President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi present the seizure as a law‑enforcement action enforcing sanctions against an illicit oil network moving Venezuelan and Iranian crude in support of designated terrorist groups.
