<p>Discovered Harper in this <a href="https://www.cyan.sh/blog/posts/goodbye-languagetool-hello-harper.html">blog post</a> but not sure how to get it to work. Installed with homebrew, evaluated the <a href="https://writewithharper.com/docs/integrations/emacs">default lisp they have on their site</a> and&hellip; <s>ok, now what? I don&rsquo;t see any Harper-related commands. Has anyone figured it out?</s></p>
<p>Short version: Harper is a frontend to Server Language Protocol (SLP). Emacs has a built-in SLP called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eglot/index.html">Eglot</a>. This means you use Eglot on Emacs to run Harper, so the interactive (M-x) command is Eglot (and it helps if you spell it correctly 🤦‍♂️). The E-Lisp configuration they have on their website (above) works fine, provided Eglot is configured to run and you have Harper installed.</p>
<p>I will expand later after I experiment some more.</p>
