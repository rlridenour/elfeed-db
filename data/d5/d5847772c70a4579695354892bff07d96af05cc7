<p>Via <a href="https://twitter.com/orangebook_/status/1291844997097099265?s=12">Orange Book</a>, a reminder to myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>In investing, patience is rewarded.</li>
<li>In growing a talent, patience is rewarded.</li>
<li>In building a business, patience is rewarded.</li>
<li>In love and friendships, patience is rewarded.</li>
<li>Patience = success</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel like there's an Emacs lesson somewhere in there…</p>
