Spotify today said that it is <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-08-04/upcoming-changes-to-spotify-premium-subscriptions/">raising prices</a> for Premium subscriptions in multiple countries across South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region.<br/>

Spotify is sending out emails to customers who will see their subscription prices go up. <br/>
<br/>
A sample email suggests that prices in an unnamed European country are increasing by a euro, from €10.99 to €11.99. Price hikes will vary by location, and Spotify users can see the new pricing for their country by <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/">visiting the Spotify website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Prices are not going up in all markets at this time including the United States. In the U.S., a Premium individual subscription continues to be priced at &#36;11.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify says prices are increasing so that it can "continue to innovate" on product offerings and features and "bring users the best experience."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/spotify-price-increase-2/">Spotify Raising Prices in Multiple Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-raising-prices-in-multiple-countries.2462759/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
