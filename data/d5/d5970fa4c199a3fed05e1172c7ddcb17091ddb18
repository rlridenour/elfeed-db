<p>DF reader Cameron McKay emailed to observe: “It strikes me that Apple changes CPU architectures (68K → PowerPC → Intel → ARM) more often than identity fonts. They’d sooner re-engineer their products’ deepest technical building blocks than change typefaces. I suspect that’s rare among tech companies.”</p>

<p>I wish I’d thought to mention that yesterday.</p>

<p>I’ll add that I suspect San Francisco might effectively be Apple’s “forever font”. Forever is a long time, but San Francisco, in its default appearance, strives for the sort of timelessness that Helvetica achieved. And <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/">San Francisco offers</a> a wide (no pun intended) variety of widths and weights. <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-17-pro/">This is San Francisco</a>. <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-air/">This is too</a>. (Screenshots for posterity, when Apple’s website changes: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/san-fran-example-iphone-17-pro.jpeg">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/12/san-fran-example-iphone-air.jpeg">iPhone Air</a>.)</p>

<p>I also suspect that Apple Silicon is Apple’s “forever architecture”.</p>
