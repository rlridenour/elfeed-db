Charles Choi, someone whom Irreal often writes about, has a new app and is looking for beta testers. His app, <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/making-an-app-looking-for-beta-testers.html">scrim</a>, is a way of making the <code>org-protocol</code> available to macOS users. The problem is that <code>org-protocol</code> depends on the ability to call <code>emacs-client</code> from within the invoking application but security rules on recent macOS versions make this difficult or impossible. Take a look at the scrim link for a fuller explanation.

Becoming a beta tester is <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/Ssm1P3Su">really easy</a>. All you have to is install <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12898">TestFlight</a> and choose the Scrim app. My experience with TestFlight has been outstanding. It automates virtually everything including keeping you up to date with the latest beta version.

The only app I ever want to export data from is Safari and I have some custom AppleScript code to handle that. Still, if I were starting today I would probably try to use <code>org-protocol</code> to solve the problem for any application supporting the share menu.

If you want to import data from other applications into Emacs or think that being able to do so would make your workflow smoother, take a look at Choi&rsquo;s post and consider becoming a beta tester. If you are already a Captee (Choi&rsquo;s previous application for this) user you should especially consider this.

I can tell you from my own experience with being <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12894">a beta tester for Journelly</a>, that it&rsquo;s a rewarding and beneficial activity. You not only get an early look at an application but can also influence its final form. And, of course, you help the developer deliver the best possible app.</p>
