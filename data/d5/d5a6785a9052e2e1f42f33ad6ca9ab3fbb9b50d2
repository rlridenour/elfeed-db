<p>The Trump administration has discussed offering lump-sum payments to Greenland residents—figures reported from $10,000 up to $100,000 per person—as part of a push to encourage the Arctic territory to split from Denmark and potentially join the United States, according to multiple reports citing sources familiar with the talks. Denmark has repeatedly said Greenland is not for sale, and Danish and Greenlandic representatives in Washington have moved to press U.S. officials and lawmakers to step back from President Trump’s takeover rhetoric. The reporting underscores how Greenland’s strategic location in the Arctic has become a focal point for high-level diplomacy—while also putting a spotlight on Greenlanders’ right to decide their own political future.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/2vjyelwkmlGbhre7202h5WNp-hFcdPAvPN4n8RbssLHZQoxhebWx6NxMrAQ_L2Up7Ke1pAgVcVUlDjUUpEZyL9UDR07APzbfSbLEa2ZAB2H1' alt='A man walks past social housing with an Inuit mural in Nuuk, Greenland (Reuters file).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Diplomatic meetings: Denmark’s ambassador Jesper Møller Sørensen and Greenland’s Washington representative Jacob Isbosethsen met White House National Security Council officials as part of a lobbying push to cool U.S. takeover language, according to Danish officials cited in reporting.</li><li>Rubio session next: Danish officials are expected to meet U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington next week, as Denmark and Greenland seek broader support inside the U.S. system.</li><li>Vance warning: Vice President JD Vance told Europeans to take President Trump “seriously” on Greenland, signaling the issue is being messaged as a live priority rather than a passing idea.</li><li>Valuation problem: Analysts quoted in one report note there is no accepted framework for “valuing” a country or autonomous territory, making any putative purchase price difficult to justify even as a hypothetical exercise.</li><li>Past US bid: The U.S. previously offered Denmark $100 million for Greenland in 1946—an offer that was rejected—and one analysis pegs that at roughly $1.6 billion in today’s money.</li></ul><blockquote>There’s not a market for buying and selling countries, - Nick Kounis</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: Officials have discussed direct payments to Greenlanders as part of an effort to encourage secession from Denmark and closer alignment with the U.S., according to multiple outlets citing sources familiar with the talks.
