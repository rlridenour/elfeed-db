Logitech users on macOS found themselves locked out of their mouse customizations yesterday after the company let a security certificate expire, breaking both its Logi Options+ and G HUB configuration apps.<br/>

Logitech devices like its MX Master series mice and MX Keys keyboards stopped working properly as a result of the oversight, with users unable to access their custom scrolling setup, button mappings, and gestures. It wasn't long before the Logitech subreddit was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/1c6oynm/logi_options_stuck_loading_forever/">awash with frustrated reports</a> as people discovered their configured peripherals had suddenly reverted to default settings.<br/>
<br/>
The Developer ID certificate is the digital signature macOS uses to verify legitimate software. The certificate that Logitech allowed to lapse was being used to secure inter-process communications, which resulted in the software not being able to start successfully, in some cases leading to an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/1q5wxug/logi_app_not_working/">endless boot loop</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Logitech has since <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/37493733117847-Options-and-G-HUB-macOS-Certificate-Issue">released a patch</a> for macOS 26 Tahoe, macOS 15 Sequoia, macOS 14 Sonoma, and macOS 13 Ventura that resolves the issue. However, users need to download and install it themselves, since the certificate expiry also prevented the apps' built-in updaters from working. From Logitech's <a href="https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/37493733117847-Options-and-G-HUB-macOS-Certificate-Issue">support page</a> acknowledging the issue:<br/>
<blockquote>The problem was caused by an expired certificate required for the apps to run. Because the certificate also affected the in‑app updater, you will need to manually download and install the updated version of the app. Please do not uninstall the app.</blockquote>Older macOS versions will get a fix "at a later time," the support page adds. On a positive note, it seems user settings survived the blunder, with Logitech promising that profiles and customizations remain intact after manual patching is completed.<br/>
<br/>
"We dropped the ball here. This is an inexcusable mistake," Logitech spokesperson ATXsantucci <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/logitech/comments/1q5wxug/comment/ny5fdhf/">admitted on Reddit</a>. "We're extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused."<br/>
