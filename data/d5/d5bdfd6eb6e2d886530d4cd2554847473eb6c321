<p>Steve Berman, The Athletic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lee Elia, who managed the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs
for two seasons apiece but is perhaps best known for a profane
postgame rant critical of Chicago fans, died on Wednesday. He was
87. The Phillies announced his death in a statement on Thursday,
though they did not say where he died or cite a cause. [...]</p>

<p>The team noted that Elia was a Philadelphia native who signed with
the Phillies in 1958. He was in the organization on and off
throughout the decades, including as a minor league player,
manager, scout and director of instruction. He was the third-base
coach for the Phillies team that won the 1980 World Series.</p>

<p>You’ll never hear a better example of how to talk like a Philadelphian than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiVVbYK9HXw">Elia’s famed 1983 rant</a>, after the Cubs opened the season 5-14. Earmuffs for any (non-Philadelphian) children in the room.</p>
