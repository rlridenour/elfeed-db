<p>Yesterday a program made my terminal&rsquo;s cursor disappear! I was really surprised
because programs so rarely mess up my terminal these days.</p>
<p>Normally my prompt looks like this:</p>

<p>But after running  <code>echo -e &quot;\033[?25l&quot;</code> (the escape code for &ldquo;make cursor
invisible&rdquo;), the cursor is gone, like this.</p>

<p>I just dealt with it by opening a new terminal tab, but you can also run
<code>reset</code> or <code>echo -e &quot;\033[?25h&quot;</code>. I don&rsquo;t really like using <code>reset</code> because it sleeps for 1 second and I find it kind of annoying, I wish it ran instantly.</p>
