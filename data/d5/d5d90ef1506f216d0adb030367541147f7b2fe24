(Sung to the tune of “John Henry”)
</p>

 <p>
When Mitch Randall was a little baby, <br></br>
sitting on his father’s knee. <br></br>
He tied a ribbon on his finger, <br></br>
and he held it in the air. <br></br>
Said, this bow tie’s gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord <br></br>
This bow tie’s gonna be the death of me.
</p>

 <p>
When Mitch Randall was just a little boy, <br></br>
his parents noticed that he was an unusual child. <br></br>
When other kids would want cookies and milk, <br></br>
all Mitch wanted was a piece of silk.
</p>

 <p>
He’d tie that silk to anything he could reach, <br></br>
the table leg, <br></br>
the chair leg, <br></br>
the dog’s leg, <br></br>
his father’s leg.
</p>

 <p>
Nice neat bows, <br></br>
straight, <br></br>
even on both sides.
</p>

 <p>
And then one day,
 <br></br>
He was standing in front of the mirror, <br></br>
seeing what he could see. <br></br>
He tied that piece of ribbon right around his neck, and said, <br></br>
this is the look for me, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
This is the look for me.
 <br></br>
So, he started wearing a bow tie to church. <br></br>
Everybody thought it was cute. <br></br>
Then he wore it to school. <br></br>
That was not so cute. <br></br>
When he started wearing it with his baseball uniform, <br></br>
everybody thought it was just a little weird.
</p>


 <p>
When the other kids started to tease him <br></br>
His dad decided to have a talk. <br></br>
He said, son, <br></br>
that may be the look down in Texas, Austin, that is, <br></br>
but this is Oklahoma, 1975. <br></br>
It’s just not that progressive a state. <br></br>
But here’s what I want you to remember:
 <br></br>
Don’t let them make fun of your bow tie, <br></br>
You gotta be who you gotta be. <br></br>
So, when you wear a bow tie round your neck, <br></br>
You gotta wear it with your head held high, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
Wear it with your head held high.
 <br></br>
Then he went off to college. <br></br>
As it was for many young people, <br></br>
college was a place for experimenting, <br></br>
pushing the envelope, <br></br>
things you wouldn’t necessarily tell your parents about, <br></br>
getting wild…
</p>

 <p>
Striped bow ties, <br></br>
plaids, <br></br>
polka dots, <br></br>
paisleys, <br></br>
there were parts of town where you could slip a man five bucks <br></br>
and he’d give you a floral pattern tie.
</p>

 <p>
Seminary was tough, though, <br></br>
cause this was fort worth, <br></br>
where they wore their hair short, <br></br>
And their ties long. <br></br>
He felt alone, <br></br>
nobody understood. <br></br>
But then one day, <br></br>
in a course on religion and the state, <br></br>
he learned about the Baptist Joint Committee, <br></br>
with men like James Dunn and Brent Walker, <br></br>
who wore their bow ties in the service of the Lord.
</p>

 <p>
And, hallelujah, Mitch had found his calling!
 <br></br>
When he saw the men with the bow ties, <br></br>
He said, you know I got to go, <br></br>
Down to Washington DC, to fight for liberty, <br></br>
I gotta be on the BJC, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
I gotta be on the BJC.
 <br></br>
Then he came to NorthHaven. <br></br>
Growing up had been tough in northeastern Oklahoma, <br></br>
but Norman was different. <br></br>
There were liberals, <br></br>
hippies, <br></br>
Democrats, <br></br>
people who wouldn’t look twice at a man with a bow tie.
</p>

 <p>
And the people of NorthHaven admired his skill. <br></br>
Even on both sides, <br></br>
nice dimple in the center. <br></br>
Straight, not crooked, <br></br>
good-looking ties.
</p>

 <p>
Everything was good, until…
 <br></br>
In one day, walked Bryan Partridge, <br></br>
With a smile on his face. <br></br>
The bow tie that we saw, was completely without flaw. <br></br>
And the challenge had been thrown down, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
The challenge had been thrown down.
</p>

 <p>
Yes, my friends, it was the beginning of the end. <br></br>
The old ways were dying, <br></br>
passing away before a new generation. <br></br>
The age of the clip-on had come.
</p>

 <p>
And Mitch Randall said to Bryan Partridge, <br></br>
I don’t care if my tie is a wreck. <br></br>
Before I put that clip-on on my shirt, <br></br>
I’ll die with a bow tie round my neck, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
I’ll die with a bow tie round my neck.
</p>

 <p>
They decided to have a contest. <br></br>
Whoever could put on the most ties in an hour <br></br>
would be the NorthHaven champion. <br></br>
It was old-school vs. the young upstart.
</p>

 <p>
And so, Mitch Randall, he started tying. <br></br>
His fingers went round and round. <br></br>
But he couldn’t make it last, <br></br>
cause the clip-on was so fast. <br></br>
It left poor Mitch on the ground, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
It left poor Mitch on the ground.
</p>

 <p>
He couldn’t keep up the pace <br></br>
With those small, delicate ties. <br></br>
He needed something bigger, easier to grasp. <br></br>
So, he reached for the secret weapon, <br></br>
The Barnum and Bailey special.
</p>

 <p>
But when he wrapped that clown tie around his neck, <br></br>
Disaster struck.
</p>

 <p>
Then his tie got caught in the shredder, <br></br>
and it pulled his head straight down. <br></br>
And the next thing that we knew, <br></br>
it looked like he was through. <br></br>
We’d have to plant poor Mitch in the ground, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
We’d have to plant poor Mitch in the ground.
</p>

 <p>
Nobody knew what to do. <br></br>
One person screamed. <br></br>
Another person laughed. <br></br>
(One of those was Cheryl, another was Kim. I’ll let you decide which was which.) <br></br>
And then Sheri walked into the room. <br></br>
she muttered something about boys and their foolishness, <br></br>
and cut that bow tie clean in half with a pair of scissors.
</p>

 <p>
Then Mitch Randall said to Bryan Partridge, <br></br>
Lord knows, I’ve been a fool. <br></br>
Well, before I die with a bow tie round my neck, <br></br>
I’m gonna get me clip-on too, Lord, Lord. <br></br>
I’m gonna get me clip-on too.
