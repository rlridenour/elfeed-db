<p><a href="https://philosophy.nd.edu/people/emeritus/alasdair-macintyre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor MacIntyre</a> wrote extensively on social, moral, and political philosophy. He is known for views which draw on historical and anthropological considerations and on traditions such as Thomism and Marxism. Those views include a virtue-based approach to ethics and what came to be known as a communitarian approach to political philosophy. Professor MacIntyre wrote several books, including <em>After Virtue </em>(1981), <em>Whose Justice? Which Rationality? </em>(1988), <em>Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry</em> (1990), and <em>Dependent Rational Animals</em> (1999). You can learn more about his work <a href="https://philpapers.org/s/Alasdair%20macintyre" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Professor MacIntyre was on the faculty at the University of Notre Dame from 1989 to 2010 and Duke University from 1995 to 1997. Prior to this, he held positions at Yale University, Vanderbilt University, Wellesley College, Boston University, Brandeis University, the University of Oxford, and elsewhere. He earned his Master of Arts degree at the University of Manchester and the University of Oxford and his undergraduate degree at the University of London.</p>
<p>MacIntyre understood himself to be a nonconformist philosopher. In an <a href="https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/on-having-survived-the-academic-moral-philosophy-of-the-20th-century/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">essay about how he &#8220;survived&#8221; academic moral philosophy in the 20th Century</a>, he says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>In moral philosophy, as in other areas of philosophy, much of what is written must go unpublished and much of what is published must go unread. What function then is served by this cruel academic treadmill?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Its function is to inculcate the currently established conception of the tasks of moral philosophy and of its past history. It is to ensure that habits of mind are transmitted, so that students by and large follow their teachers in their assumptions about which few books and articles must or may be read and which may be safely ignored. It is to make certain that the young recognize whose arguments are to be taken seriously and whose disdained, when and about what to make jokes, and at whom and with whom it is permissible to sneer or condescend. It is to shape minds so that they are open to some ideas and closed to others. Academic moral philosophy is a conformist discipline, and habituation in writing what is well designed to secure the approval of those with established academic power is one principal means of producing and reinforcing that conformism.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Two salient thoughts emerge from this narrative. The first concerns the importance for the moral philosopher of living on the margins, intellectually as well as politically, a necessary condition for being able to see things as they are&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>A second thought, perhaps in tension with the first, concerns the importance for the moral philosopher of nonetheless learning as much as she or he can from those at the academic center, those who have made definitive contributions to the ongoing debates of academic moral philosophy. For interestingly it is often they who supply the resources that one needs if one is to free oneself from the limitations of their standpoint. If one is to evaluate both the achievements and the defects of twentieth-century academic moral philosophy, it needs to be understood both from within and from a standpoint that is at once external and radically critical. It is such a standpoint that I have tried to define.</em></p>
<p>He died on May 21st, 2025.</p>
