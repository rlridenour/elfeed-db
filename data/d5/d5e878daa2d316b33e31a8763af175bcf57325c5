For years I&rsquo;ve been using pop3 to collect my gmails, without problem. However, since yesterday it is failing. I use getmail and have made no changes since originally getting it working. When I use getmail -vvv I get the following error:
 Retrieval error: server for SimplePOP3SSLRetriever:recent:&laquo;myaddress&gt;@gmail.com@pop.gmail.com:995 is broken; offered message GmailId1718e4039279f0fe but failed to provide it. Please notify the administrator of the server. Skipping message…
 I don&rsquo;t see any notification of recent changes, but my mail client is devoid of gmail functionality now.
