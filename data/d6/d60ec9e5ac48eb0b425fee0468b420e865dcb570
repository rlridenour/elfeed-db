         
         <p>I am discontinuing the development of the <em>Iosevka Comfy</em> fonts,
effective immediately. My new fonts are called <em>Aporetic</em> and are the
successor to my earlier project.</p>

<p>Aporetic fonts:</p>

  <li>Backronym: Aporetic’s Predecessor Objects’ Reserved Eponym Truly Included “Comfy”.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Backronym: Iosevka … Could Only Modify a Font, Yes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Legal reason for the change</h2>

<p>“Iosevka” is a reserved name. I had not realised this until I reread
the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1, specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3  No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved
   Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the
   corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to
   the primary font name as presented to the users.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Technical reasons for the change</h2>

<p>I wanted to change the names of the font families to make them more
intuitive. Instead of something like “Iosevka Comfy Motion Duo” I now
have “Aporetic Serif”. The full list is further below.</p>

<p>I also had to reduce the number of variants and font weights to both
(i) streamline what I am offering and (ii) make it possible to build
the fonts on my computer.</p>

<h2>Changes relative to Iosevka Comfy</h2>

<p>The fonts are these:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Current name</th>
      <th>Old name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Aporetic Sans</td>
      <td>Iosevka Comfy Duo</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Aporetic Serif</td>
      <td>Iosevka Comfy Motion Duo</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Aporetic Sans Mono</td>
      <td>Iosevka Comfy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Aporetic Serif Mono</td>
      <td>Iosevka Comfy Motion</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I no longer provide “fixed” and “wide” variants.</p>

<p>All glyphs are the same as before except for the zero (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>), which is
now always rendered with a forward slash and a wider body. The reason
for this change is that the narrow oval shape could be mistaken for a
Greek theta (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">θ</code>).</p>

<p>Font weights are also reduced to just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regular</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bold</code>.</p>

<h2>Why “aporetic”</h2>

<p>It is a nice Greek word and no other fonts with this name exist.</p>
