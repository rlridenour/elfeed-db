<p>Apple dropped their latest batch of iPhones this week, along with new Apple Watches and an AirPods Pro update. Here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>



<p>The iPhone 17 lineup brings the usual suspects with some interesting twists. The standard 17 gets some nice upgrades and features that were traditionally only on the Pro phones, like ProMotion. The 17 Pro and Pro Max got a noticeable upgrade to the cameras, and their switch from titanium to aluminum should allow the A19 Pro chip to cook without actually cooking. The Pro models finally get some personality with new color options (more on that in a minute). The oddball is the iPhone Air. It&#8217;s remarkably thin and light, but you&#8217;re giving up some camera capabilities and battery life to get there.</p>



<p>On the wearables front, the Apple Watch Series 11 focuses on health tracking improvements and better battery life. The new Apple Watch Ultra 3 is the notable watch release this year, getting satellite communications from your wrist, a slightly bigger screen (in the same size case), and several other iterative improvements.</p>



<p>The new AirPods Pro 3 bring improved noise cancellation and, hopefully, even a better fit for more people. They also added two more watch faces that appear entirely inscrutable to me. Apple’s streak of bad Apple Watch faces continues.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what really struck me about this event, though. The iPhone Air is fascinating because it&#8217;s not following Apple&#8217;s usual playbook. This isn&#8217;t a budget phone. It&#8217;s not a performance monster either. Apple&#8217;s asking people to pay premium prices for something thinner and lighter, and they&#8217;re paying with both money and features. You&#8217;re getting less camera capability than the Pro phones. Battery life won&#8217;t match the Plus models. But for some people, having a phone that practically disappears in their pocket will be worth those trade-offs.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t expect the Air to be a runaway success, and that&#8217;s perfectly fine. I actually love that Apple&#8217;s making phones for different priorities now. They&#8217;re the only company making iPhones, so we only get what they give us. But at least they&#8217;re giving us more options than &#8220;big or bigger&#8221; and &#8220;expensive or more expensive&#8221;. Some folks want the absolute best camera system. Others want all-day battery life. And apparently, some people just want their phone to be as thin as possible. Good for them.</p>



<p>As for me? I&#8217;m going all-in on the iPhone 17 Pro Max in orange. Apple&#8217;s never offered vivid colors on the Pro phones before, and I&#8217;m here for it. After years of Space Gray and Natural Titanium, I want something with personality. My phone is with me constantly. Why shouldn&#8217;t it spark a little joy? The Air doesn’t really call out to me. I’m always going to want the most powerful iPhone with the best cameras. Also, the difference in weight between the iPhone Pro Max and the iPhone Air is 66 grams. That’s not insignificant for something you put in your pocket, yet it seems trivial to me for those additional features and battery life.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the Air might be more important than it appears. Word is Apple&#8217;s been working hard on ultra-thin phone technology because next year we might see a folding iPhone. Folding phones need to be incredibly thin since a folding phone necessarily has two screens stacked together. Samsung and others have been selling folding phones for years now, and the timing feels right for Apple to jump in with its take on it.</p>



<p>I spend a lot of time reading on my phone, so the idea of unfolding it into a mini-tablet has real appeal. I&#8217;m already starting to save because if Apple does release a folding iPhone, it&#8217;s going to cost serious money. We&#8217;re probably looking at $2,000 or more if the current folding phone market is any indication. After years of incremental updates, we&#8217;re getting real variety in the lineup, and next year could bring the biggest form factor change since the original iPhone.</p>



<p>In short, the iPhone is interesting again.</p>
