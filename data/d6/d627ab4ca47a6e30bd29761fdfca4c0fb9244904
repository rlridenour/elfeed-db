  <p>When you ask the AI a question, you have the option of hitting a
share button, which then directs you to a screen showing a preview
of the post, which you can then publish. But some users appear
blissfully unaware that they are sharing these text conversations,
audio clips, and images publicly with the world.</p>

<p>When I woke up this morning, I did not expect to hear an audio
recording of a man in a Southern accent asking, “Hey, Meta, why do
some farts stink more than other farts?”</p>

<p>Flatulence-related inquiries are the least of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai-chatbot-discover-feed-depressing-why-2025-6">Meta’s
problems</a>. On the Meta AI app, I have seen people ask for
help with tax evasion, if their family members would be arrested
for their proximity to white-collar crimes, or how to write a
character reference letter for an employee facing legal troubles,
with that person’s first and last name included. Others, like
security expert Rachel Tobac, <a href="https://x.com/racheltobac/status/1933006223109959820">found examples</a> of people’s
home addresses and sensitive court details, among other private
information.</p>

  <p>I found Meta AI’s Discover feed depressing in a particular way — not just because some of the questions themselves were depressing.
What seemed particularly dark was that some of these people seemed
unaware of what they were sharing.</p>

<p>People’s real Instagram or Facebook handles are attached to their
Meta AI posts. I was able to look up some of these people’s
real-life profiles, although I felt icky doing so. I reached out
to more than 20 people whose posts I’d come across in the feed to
ask them about their experience; I heard back from one, who told
me that he hadn’t intended to make his chat with the bot public.
(He was asking for car repair advice.)</p>
