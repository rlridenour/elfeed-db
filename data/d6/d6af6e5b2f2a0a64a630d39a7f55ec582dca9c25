<p id="p2">If you thought Apple&rsquo;s leadership changes were finished, you&rsquo;d be wrong. Today, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-executive-transitions/?1764883861" rel="noopener noreferrer">the company announced</a> two more changes.</p>
<p id="p3">The first change is to Apple&rsquo;s General Counsel position, which has been led by Kate Adams since 2017. Adams will step down as general counsel on March 1, 2026 and will be replaced by Jennifer Newstead, Meta&rsquo;s recent general counsel. Newstead will begin her tenure at Apple at the beginning of 2026 as a senior vice president and report to Tim Cook.</p>
<p id="p4">The second change is that Lisa Jackson, Apple&rsquo;s vice president for Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives is retiring in late January 2026. Under her leadership, Apple says it has reduced its global greenhouse emissions by 60% in the past ten years. Upon Jackson&rsquo;s retirement, Government Affairs will be handled by Adams who will be staying at Apple until late 2026 when she plans to retire herself, at which point Government Affairs will become Newstead&rsquo;s responsibility. The team handling Environmental and Social Initiatives will report to Sabih Khan, Apple&rsquo;s chief operating officer.</p>
<p id="p5">Although Apple doesn&rsquo;t say so in its press release, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that a few things are playing out among its executive ranks. First, a large number of them are approaching retirement age, and Apple is transitioning and changing roles internally to account for those who are retiring. Second, the company is dealing with <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/bloomberg-reports-that-alan-dye-is-leaving-apple/" rel="noopener noreferrer">departures like Alan Dye&rsquo;s</a> and what appears to be the less-than-voluntary <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/john-giannandreas-retirement-from-apple-announced/" rel="noopener noreferrer">retirement of John Giannandrea</a>. Finally, the company is reducing the number of Tim Cook&rsquo;s direct reports, which is undoubtedly to simplify the transition to a new CEO in the relatively near future.</p>
