Apple is working on a new version of the Vision Pro with two key advantages over the current model, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-13/apple-vision-pro-2-details-low-latency-headset-ar-glasses-ipados-19-details-m9flf1fd"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

Specifically, in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-13/apple-vision-pro-2-details-low-latency-headset-ar-glasses-ipados-19-details-m9flf1fd"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman said Apple is developing a new headset that is both lighter and less expensive than the current Vision Pro, which starts at &#36;3,499 in the U.S. and weighs up to 1.5 pounds.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said Apple is also working on another version of the Vision Pro that can have a wired connection with a Mac, for an ultra-low-latency experience.<br/>
<br/>
"The idea is to create an ultra-low-latency system for streaming a user's Mac display or for connecting to high-end enterprise applications," said Gurman. "Some customers have been using the Vision Pro for things like viewing imaging during surgery or for flight simulators. Those are two areas where a user would want the least amount of lag possible — something that can't be guaranteed by a fully wireless system."<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear when Apple plans to release either of these headsets. The current Vision Pro was released in February 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman added that one of Apple CEO Tim Cook's top priorities remains true augmented reality glasses, but such a product likely remains "many years" away.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/vision-pro-2-two-rumored-upgrades/">Vision Pro 2 Rumored to Have Two Key Advantages Over Current Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-2-rumored-to-have-two-key-advantages-over-current-model.2455238/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
