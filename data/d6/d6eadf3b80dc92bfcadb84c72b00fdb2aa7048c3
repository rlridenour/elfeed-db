<p>That&#8217;s from an open letter, begun at UC Berkeley but now available for academics anywhere to sign, in defense of freedom of expression and academic freedom at universities, in light of the Trump administrations attacks on higher education. These attacks include the political weaponization of funding for universities, interference in the research and teaching operations of universities, the deportation of individuals involved in campus protests, and more.</p>
<p>The text of the letter is below. You can can see a Google Docs version of it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epRhBQf9Ul7aGwZZCCruR_7IuEbiG3asPJNGluaVcxk/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and sign it <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNOt4a84UIiCWL6vi-QXuwMoiUsZJyyBUk2bHf-5i8zq3dFg/viewform?usp=header" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a perilous moment for American universities. Federal funding commitments are being weaponized to pressure universities to comply with demands of the current administration. At the same time, individuals at institutions of higher education are being threatened with deportation for political speech. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, the undersigned, call on faculty and academic leaders at Berkeley and other American institutions to stand firm and protect our core values in response to these assaults.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom of thought and expression is indispensable to the mission of a modern research university. Our entire intellectual community is impoverished unless all of its members, regardless of their political viewpoint or immigration status, may freely express themselves without fear of retaliation. Academic freedom is an essential safeguard for free expression. It protects the right of faculty to pursue their scientific and scholarly investigations in accordance with their own best judgments about the inquiries in which they are engaged. It protects the rights of instructors to design and deliver their courses, and the rights of both faculty and students to discuss issues in the classroom that are germane to the subject, including issues of contemporary controversy. It confers authority on the university and its faculty to administer its academic programs and enforce its own internal norms and expectations. Finally, all members of an academic community must have the right to engage in protected political speech.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">These commitments are non-negotiable. They are absolutely central to our academic and social mission, and have made Berkeley and other American institutions prolific engines of scientific and scholarly discovery for the benefit of humanity. But these same commitments to free expression are also under direct threat, as recent events involving Columbia University have shown. There is no room for compromise on these issues as universities deal with the political pressures to which they may be subject in the weeks and months to come. On the contrary, we call on faculty and academic leaders to defend our commitment to free expression vigorously and without apology in the public sphere, and to do everything in their power to protect the rights of members of our community from outside interference. </span></em></p>
