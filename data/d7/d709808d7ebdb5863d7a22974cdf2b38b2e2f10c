<p>The Daily Show:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Award-winning journalist Patrick McGee joins Jon Stewart to
discuss how Apple built China in his new book <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/56320/9781668053379">Apple in China</a>: The
Capture of the World’s Greatest Company</em>. They talk about Apple
“sleepwalking” into this crisis, building a competitive market in
Xi Jinping’s authoritarian state, the vocational training that
boosted rivals, how Trump’s attempted Apple boycott backfired, and
whether investments may be facilitating the annexation of Taiwan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Terrific interview. I’m a few chapters into the book, and it’s good. McGee’s a good writer and a serious reporter — the depth of his research shows. It feels not like a few stories padded out to book length, but instead the distillation of a complex story that demands an entire book to tell.</p>
