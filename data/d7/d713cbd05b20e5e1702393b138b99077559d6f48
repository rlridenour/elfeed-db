<p>On his first overseas trip as pontiff, Pope Leo XIV has completed a four-day visit to Turkey and flown on to Lebanon, carrying a message of peace and hope to a country strained by economic collapse, the 2020 Beirut port blast and ongoing Israeli air strikes along its border. In Turkey, he met President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, joined commemorations of the 1,700th anniversary of the First Council of Nicaea in Iznik, celebrated Mass with the small Catholic community and worked to deepen ties with Orthodox patriarchs and other Christian leaders. He also visited Istanbul’s Blue Mosque without stopping to pray, signaling that this trip’s priority was strengthening Christian unity and inter-church reconciliation rather than shared worship at Muslim sites. In Lebanon, where he will stay until Tuesday, his schedule includes prayers at major Christian shrines such as St Charbel’s monastery in Annaya, Our Lady of Lebanon in Harissa and the Maronite Patriarchate in Bkerke, visits that many Lebanese hope will bring moral support and international attention to one of the Middle East’s most fragile Christian communities.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/_1qklAXHrmIcjzJjvU33CIpLB9HMZdewDlL6Ni3ikimOwVdPGSNx-exgd-6r30AnOVduImo7lyraLJUuvSJEgJWSPQ037oOH_uG9QmRUdonAD-gfyEjEXOwLrHqbldzTnCPYSKzck7vPAlQQJA077rexXXOGEOJlcXmp2SG7XOPNpItkpwUsP98dKZBphrAp6I2gHSipzALm3xr3p_OVbQ' alt='Pope Leo XIV walks through Istanbul’s Sultan Ahmed (Blue) Mosque during his first overseas trip as pontiff.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Blue Mosque visit: During a roughly 20‑minute tour of Istanbul’s 17th‑century Blue Mosque, Pope Leo smiled, chatted with guides and chose not to engage in silent prayer, a change from some previous papal visits that surprised even Vatican officials.</li><li>Armenian cathedral stop: Before leaving Turkey, he held prayers at the Armenian Apostolic Cathedral in Istanbul, a gesture framed by Vatican officials as support for Christian minorities and for ongoing Turkish‑Armenian reconciliation efforts.</li><li>Focus on Christian unity: In Turkey the pope concentrated on strengthening relations with Orthodox patriarchs and other Eastern churches, urging what he called “courageous steps” toward unity between Eastern and Western Christianity.</li><li>Warning on regional conflict: Across his Turkish speeches he repeatedly cautioned that the world risks sliding into a patchwork of interconnected conflicts that could expand into a wider war, using the trip to appeal for de‑escalation in the broader Middle East before arriving in Lebanon.</li><li>Lebanese pilgrimage sites: His Lebanese itinerary includes the first‑ever papal visit to the shrine of St Charbel at the Maronite Monastery of St Maron in Annaya—timed to the anniversary of the saint’s death—as well as a stop at Our Lady of Lebanon in Harissa overlooking Jounieh Bay, both destinations that attract pilgrims from multiple faiths.</li></ul><blockquote>We must not resign ourselves to the idea that war is inevitable. - Pope Leo XIV</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pope Leo XIV: The pope has framed his twin visits to Turkey and Lebanon as a mission to encourage peace, warn against the spread of overlapping conflicts and support Christian communities that feel especially vulnerable in the region.
