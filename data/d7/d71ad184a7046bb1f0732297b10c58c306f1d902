<p>In the latest development in efforts to end the war in Gaza, Qatar’s prime minister warned that talks to turn the current pause in fighting into a full ceasefire are at a “critical” moment as the first phase of the U.S.-backed deal winds down. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told the Doha Forum that mediators led by the United States are working “to force the way forward” toward a second phase that would consolidate the agreement, but he stressed that what exists now is only a pause, not a complete ceasefire. Qatar and Egypt, which act as guarantors of the truce, are publicly urging Israel to withdraw its troops from Gaza and to accept the deployment of an international stabilisation force as outlined in the U.S.- and UN-backed peace plan, arguing these steps are essential for the next phase of the accord. At the same time, reports of Israeli air raids and demolitions in parts of Gaza, as well as deadly incidents in the occupied West Bank, have raised fears among mediators that the fragile arrangement could unravel if it does not soon progress toward a more durable political settlement.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/5sO_dPXDnYY60ADZ9Hl8DjXZiaN14OfKZx0rsmQE27Z5cVPYHBhW8le9DoBHZpZ47ogTPaoIVCbveHwYhVnA5S8r1sN3Nsx5UpjFiQv7CQC7_ZpFiD2X61_PIlCVQnUuTsSHQ9ggW3RTa0rL-WmDUP-EcQmY53EBFBVcmgB7XICESOyMK7A1sLS8oSxX2xaNhgcD4hbrooUWB_Sj3OtozFniMJUi4rrzCTDevc4ZRxMROBU1ih54ouKRN66CHY_eh0r9-oCpmW_1wDvKDPysOkWcjDA3D6JviD-KFWScBw' alt='Regional diplomats meet to discuss steps for the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire arrangement.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Second-phase goals: The proposed second phase of the peace plan includes a full Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza, disarmament arrangements and the introduction of an international force to help stabilise the territory and monitor implementation of the ceasefire terms.</li><li>Mediator coordination: Qatar and Egypt say they are coordinating closely with Washington and the United Nations as they press both Israel and Palestinian factions to accept the next steps laid out in the multi-stage agreement.</li><li>Risk of collapse: Qatar’s prime minister cautioned that the current pause could “shatter” if it does not soon transition into a permanent political arrangement, a warning echoed by Turkey’s foreign minister who also urged movement toward a lasting deal.</li><li>Continued military actions: Despite the truce framework, Israeli forces reportedly carried out air raids on the Maghazi camp in central Gaza, demolitions in eastern and southern areas of the enclave, and operations that killed several Palestinians in the north.</li><li>West Bank tensions: In the occupied West Bank, Israeli settlers were reported to have attacked an elderly Palestinian woman, her grandson and two volunteers near Ramallah and to have set up mobile homes in the area, underscoring wider regional tensions alongside the Gaza talks.</li></ul><blockquote>What we have just done is a pause.
