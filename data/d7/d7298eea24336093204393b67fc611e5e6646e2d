<p>Australia has put into effect a nationwide ban on social media accounts for people younger than 16, ordering major platforms including TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, X and Snapchat to block access for underage users from Wednesday and remove existing accounts linked to them. The federal law, an amendment to Australia’s online safety framework, aims to reduce harms linked in public debate to social media use by children, such as bullying, exposure to violent or sexual content, and impacts on mental health. Platforms that fail to comply face fines reported at up to A$49.5 million, while parents or guardians must now give consent for 16- and 17‑year‑olds to hold accounts. Supporters, including many parents and child advocates, welcome the law as a protective step, but young people, civil liberties groups and some experts warn it may erode privacy through age‑verification demands, limit teens’ access to information and support networks, and prove easy to evade with technical workarounds.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Ymufs3E0z5lubDf9W6oz7QYNGOzSCv8LpnDJGJGu3J2bFT0vhB1-_8JE8Xjjn-jBf8P0qsOO0lDOQIn5tBoPH-T_6c7ZM4u46VubS1BBskHKx1P5bhyjvhMZmEaGP4rDhAcHER1o7WVCVcjsMeIkyitQZjHM8mfjnvo0RkiwVYvPGx2R5HuKM6nWpaKclUnLpPFdjpjtw0l3Jic5Nxebz7Z5X3AGoCyz9yLu24YQz6Dg-KqZymRQVJU-DGwKCzo1Muokk8Qh01aVtzwAjw' alt='School students in Sydney use smartphones as Australia’s under‑16 social media ban begins.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scope of platforms: The ban covers at least ten major services, including TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, X, Snapchat, Reddit, Threads, Kick and Twitch, all of which have been instructed to prevent new under‑16 sign‑ups and delete accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia.</li><li>Enforcement mechanism: Australia’s online safety regulator can order platforms to show how they are blocking children and may impose multi‑million‑dollar penalties if they fail to demonstrate reasonable steps toward compliance under the new amendment.</li><li>Age verification tools: On services like Snapchat, a specialist tech company now checks users’ ages using verification technologies that the firm describes as safe, but cybersecurity researchers caution that any such data transfer introduces potential privacy and security vulnerabilities.</li><li>Teen workarounds: Some teenagers are already sharing tips on using VPNs, false birth dates and overseas SIM cards to sidestep Australia‑based restrictions and maintain access to their social media accounts despite the law.</li><li>Global ripple effects: Governments in other countries are closely observing Australia’s rollout as they consider age‑based social‑media rules of their own, making this law an early test case for stronger youth‑online‑safety regulation worldwide.</li></ul><blockquote>We are trying to give kids back their childhood - Michelle Rowland</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Australian federal government: Officials present the ban as a child-safety measure designed to shield young people from online bullying, grooming and inappropriate content while encouraging more offline social interaction.
