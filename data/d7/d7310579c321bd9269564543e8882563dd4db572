<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://hledger.org/">hledger</a> since 2022. I started it as an experiment hoping to understand where my money goes, find some patterns in my spending
and save some money eventually. I did not identify many patterns, if any, but I still was able to save some money.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to describe how and why I find tracking money being useful and then I&rsquo;ll show you my setup.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-it-useful-to-track-finances">Why is it useful to track finances</h2>
<p>It seems like, at least in my case, I was able to reduce money spend just by tracking where they go.
I blame my subconscious for this. For example I probably noticed that I spend too much on food delivery services and then I started to cook at home more often.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember any cases during almost 4 years when I found a spending pattern that was an obvious issue. Never happened. Some things happened though:</p>
<ul>
<li>I found some cases when I paid too much fees for a service I used regularly, which then led me to find a replacement for it.</li>
<li>Found that I pay for telecommunications (internet, phone) too much considering my usage. It led me to close some internet accounts and change my phone package.</li>
<li>I paid too much for the apartment I rented. I didn&rsquo;t need hledger to figure this out, but doing summary report one day, I noticed the money I spent on it in 6 months were uncomfortably large even though monthly payment was acceptable by me.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve noticed coffee prices went up :D</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-i-track-it">How I track it</h2>
<p>I use my phone and laptop with Emacs. Files are synced using <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthing</a>. The whole process is half automated.</p>
<p>On my phone I use Termux and <a href="https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:API">Termux:API</a> package. It allows me to get list of all notifications that
I can then parse into hledger records.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/krydos/62a7c5de05a74606e2c56a3a6e321523">I have a script</a> (call <code>ledger-check</code> to execute it) that parses all notifications and if a bank notifications found, saves them into the <code>ledger.journal</code> file (which is a hledger file for current year).
It runs every minute on my phone in Termux session so notifications aren&rsquo;t usually lost.</p>
<p>The script makes <code>sha256</code> hash from each record and adds it to the hledger file as well so next time the script is ran the records not duplicated.</p>
<p>Each record looks similar to this:</p>
<pre>
;; automation:bf4e2493fc27a6d17bd173ea9c70620759766f29
;; datetime: 2025-09-25 17:32:42
;; content: Paid $20.65 at Place Name Here AUD Balance: $100.41
2025-09-25 eating out
 expenses:food:eat-out 20.65 AUD
 assets:banks:bankname1
</pre>
<br/>
<p>In this case the title and expense category were recognised automatically because I have this place mentioned in my templates list (see the script).
Otherwise it would mark it as <code>expenses:unknown</code> which means I then should go and manually update records on my laptop. This is why I keep <code>content:</code> to each
record which is full content of push notification received from a bank app. It helps me to deal with &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; records later.</p>
<p><strong>Every week on Sunday</strong> I then review my spendings and check if amount of money in my bank account matches with what hledger report tells me.
I manually adjust my ledger records if there is a mismatch (using special expense category for this).</p>
<p>Thanks to Emacs and <a href="https://github.com/ledger/ledger-mode">ledger-mode</a> I can just simply run <code>M-x ledger-report</code> and choose among many pre-existing reports.
I also made a few of my own.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that parsing bank notifications is easier than looking for ways to integrate with a bank or special bank reports that are often available for download.</p>
<p>Keeping all the records in simple text file has been very useful and makes me feel safe. I believe simple txt format will never go away.
If <a href="https://hledger.org/">hledger</a> disappears I can easily replace it with <a href="https://ledger-cli.org/">ledger</a> or <a href="https://github.com/beancount/beancount">beancount</a>.
Even with my own scripts if necessary.</p>
<p>I sometimes read that people use a tool for a week or a month and able to tell how useful it is.
I wish I have similar skill.
I think test driving this tool for 4 years proves its usefulness for me.</p>
