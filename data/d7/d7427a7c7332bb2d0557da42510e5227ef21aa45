<p>I released a hopefully inspiring gallery:</p>

<p>We divide the showcase under the categories <strong>Music</strong>, <strong>Games</strong>, <strong>Graphics and CAD</strong>, <strong>Science and industry</strong>, <strong>Web applications</strong>, <strong>Editors</strong> and <strong>Utilities</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course:</p>

<hr />

<p>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to share a screenshot of your app! It can be closed
source and yourself as the sole user, as long as it as some sort of a
GUI, and you use it. Historical success stories are for
another collection.</p>

<p>The criteria are:</p>

<ul>
<li>built in Common Lisp</li>
<li>with some sort of a graphical interface</li>
<li>targeted at end users</li>
<li>a clear reference, anywhere on the web, by email to me or simply as a comment here, that it is built in CL.</li>
</ul>

<p>Details:</p>

<ul>
<li>it can be web applications whose server side is CL, even if the JS/HTML is classical web tech.</li>
<li>no CLI interfaces. A readline app is OK but hey, we can do better.</li>
<li>it can be closed-source or open-source, commercial, research or a personal software</li>
<li>regarding &ldquo;end users&rdquo;: I don&rsquo;t see how to include a tool like CEPL, but I did include a screen of LispWorks.</li>
<li>bonus point if it is developed in a company (we want it on <a href="https://github.com/azzamsa/awesome-lisp-companies/">https://github.com/azzamsa/awesome-lisp-companies/</a>), be it a commercial product or an internal tool.</li>
</ul>
