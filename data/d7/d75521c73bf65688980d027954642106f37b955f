<p>Book recommendations. Haven’t done these for a while. So here is a list of books you should read.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Myth-American-Business-Government-ebook/dp/B0B55F4XBY" target="_blank">The Big Myth How American Business Taught Us to Loathe Government and Love the Free Market by Oreskes, Naomi, Conway, Erik M.</a>. This was informative and detailed. It also had the ancillary benefit of increasing my blood pressure. <strong>Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway</strong> do great books. I have read a couple more of their books.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Win-Every-Argument-Debating-Persuading-ebook/dp/B09TYQNFFG" target="_blank">Win Every Argument The Art of Debating, Persuading, and Public Speaking by Hasan, Mehdi</a>. <strong>Mehdi Hasan</strong> hosts a news show on MSNBC, he provides an interesting international perspective on the subject of debating and persuading. Brilliant stuff, full of fantastic stories.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-South-Won-Civil-War-ebook/dp/B084T78RLD" target="_blank">How the South Won the Civil War Oligarchy, Democracy, and the Continuing Fight for the Soul of America by Richardson, Heather Cox</a>. “<strong>Heather Cox Richardson</strong> is an American historian and professor of history at Boston College, where she teaches courses on the American Civil War, the Reconstruction Era, the American West, and the Plains Indians. She previously taught history at MIT and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.”<a href="#footnote-1TV5" class="footnote-ref" id="ref-1TV5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> She is brilliant. This was a work which tries to explain America from the context of the history of this country. Brilliant and informative. She has a <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/" target="_blank">newsletter</a> where she discusses current news topics through that same lens of historical context. Subscribe to it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-OK-Angry-About-Capitalism-ebook/dp/B0BL6X3CJC" target="_blank">It’s OK to Be Angry About Capitalism by Sanders, Bernie</a>. <strong>Senator Bernie Sanders</strong> is one of a kind. This is a great read full of his strident voice. I loved it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Empireland-Imperialism-Shaped-Modern-Britain-ebook/dp/B0B2MK82V6" target="_blank">Empireland How Imperialism Has Shaped Modern Britain by Sanghera, Sathnam, James, Marlon</a>. This is an attempt to understand the British Empire, and its effect on current Britain.</li>
<li>For a lighter read. Get the Chief Inspector Gamache novels. They are written by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Louise+Penny" target="_blank">Louise Penny</a>. Entertaining and gripping reads. There are 18 books(so far) in the series. Start from the beginning. Thank me later.</li>
