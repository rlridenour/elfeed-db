The new Apple Watch lineup is now available to pre-order. With more feature parity than ever before across the models, understanding the differences is more important ever before. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/Buyers-Guide-Apple-Watch-SE-3-Series-11-or-Ultra-3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1018345" /><br/>
All three of the new Apple Watches feature the S10 chip, always-on displays, sleep score, and media playback, but there are still some significant differences between the two devices.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> is designed to be a low-cost option that still offers many of the Apple Watch features that have made the device so popular over the years, while the Apple Watch Series 11 offers a more feature-rich experience with additional health monitoring capabilities. The Apple Watch Ultra focuses on withstanding extreme environments, a high level of durability, extended battery life, and additional features to aid activities like diving and exploration.<br/>
<br/>
With as little as &#36;50 between the 46mm titanium Apple Watch Series 11 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3, some prospective customers will be weighing up whether it is worth spending a little extra to get the 49mm Ultra model. While there is a &#36;400 difference between the GPS-only 42mm aluminum Apple Watch Series 11 and the Apple Watch Ultra, the high-end model offers a set of features to address specific challenges, so it may even be worth it for some of these buyers. <br/>
<br/>
This guide outlines all of the differences between the &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; 3, Apple Watch Series 11, and Apple Watch Ultra 3 to help you decide which is best for you. <br/>

<h3 id="which_one_should_you_choose">Which One Should You Choose?</h3><br/>
<h4>SE 3 vs. Series 11</h4><br/>
The Apple Watch Series 11 is a minor improvement over the previous Series 10 model, offering a 5G connectivity and longer battery life. Yet compared to the &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; 3, the Apple Watch Series 11 is a noticeably more feature-rich device with advanced capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
With its larger display, additional health monitoring features, and range of colors and finishes, the Apple Watch Series 11 will be the model of choice for those who want more out of their smartwatch. If you feel that the added health monitoring features or longer battery life would be particularly beneficial to you, or simply like a specific casing and color combination not available with the &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; 3, the Apple Watch Series 11 will be the best model for you.<br/>
<br/>
If you are on a budget and are not particularly attracted to the additional features of the Series 11, the &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; 3 is still a compelling option. As it shares many key features with the Apple Watch Series 11, many customers will be happy choosing the more inexpensive model, unless you particularly value features such as the larger display or advanced health monitoring and can justify the added cost. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; 3 is an ideal device for kids and senior citizens who do not have an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; thanks to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/family-setup/">Family Setup</a>, but it is also the go-to model for most customers who are new to the Apple Watch and those who are upgrading from an older device due to its competitive pricing and generous feature set, allowing users to get a balanced Apple Watch experience at a low price.<br/>
<br/>
<h4>Series 11 vs. Ultra 3</h4><br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra offers specific capabilities to address the requirements of those who need their Apple Watch to provide assistance in challenging environments. If you need a more durable Apple Watch with features like a brighter display, louder speakers, a more reliable GPS, better water resistance, and more, the Apple Watch Ultra is undoubtedly the best choice. The Apple Watch Ultra is clearly better equipped to handle tasks like hiking, diving, and navigation.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra is also biggest and most feature-rich Apple Watch option available, not to mention that it offers the first true redesign of the device since its introduction in 2015. For technology enthusiasts, Apple Watch Ultra represents a way to get a new Apple Watch experience with top specifications in several key areas. Features like longer battery life, a brighter display, and the Action button are also highly accessible, and will be beneficial to all users. As such, some customers may still be inclined to choose the Apple Watch Ultra 3 over the Apple Watch Series 11, even if they do not need it for use in challenging environments.<br/>
<br/>
As the largest Apple Watch model to date, the size of the Apple Watch Ultra will not be for everyone. If you already prefer the 41mm or 42mm Apple Watch casing size, the Apple Watch Ultra may be far too large for you. If in doubt, it may be worth heading to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> and trying on the Apple Watch Ultra in person to get to grips with the size and determine if it is too big and bulky for you. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the Apple Watch Ultra's look may not appeal to some buyers. If you prefer the idea of a polished finish and are looking for a more fashion-focused smartwatch that pairs well with premium bands, the more aggressive, rugged design of the Apple Watch Ultra may not be for you. <br/>
<br/>
If the Apple Watch Ultra is out of your price range but you still want to use your Apple Watch in challenging environments, it is worth bearing in mind that the Series 11 still offers a durable design with a strong front crystal, water resistance, and many of the Apple Watch Ultra's software features like waypoint marking.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra 3 has a lot to offer, especially for the subset of users who can take advantage of all of its capabilities, so it is certainly worth considering when purchasing a new model, but the Apple Watch Series 11 is still a compelling all-around option that comes in at a lower price point with a subtler design.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/buyers-guide-apple-watch-se-3-series-11-ultra-3/">Buyer&#039;s Guide: Apple Watch SE 3, Series 11, or Ultra 3? 45+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/buyers-guide-apple-watch-se-3-series-11-or-ultra-3-45-differences-compared.2465217/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
