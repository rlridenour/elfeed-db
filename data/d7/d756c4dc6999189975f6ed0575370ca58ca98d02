It's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> launch day, and <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera is here to tell you why the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> is the best &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that Apple has to offer this year. Dan has been using the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; for the last week, and he has some thoughts on feature set and value.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; is still priced starting at &#36;799, but this year, it has some features that were previously limited to the Pro models. It supports 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates for smoother scrolling and video, and Always-On display technology.<br/>
<br/>
It has a larger 6.3-inch display that matches the size of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and it has a faster A19 chip. It's not quite as good as the A19 Pro in the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models, but it's more than fast enough for everyday use. You do get 4GB less RAM, but the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; still works with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> and supports all of the same AI features as the other &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
The front glass is more durable and less prone to scratching, and you get two camera lenses, which is one more lens than you get with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>. The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; has Wide and Ultra Wide cameras, but it lacks the Telephoto that comes with the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models. The Ultra Wide camera is the same 48-megapixel camera that was added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro models last year, and this is the first time the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; has had two 48-megapixel lenses.<br/>
<br/>
You do get the same 18-megapixel front-facing camera that's in the Pro models. It supports taking selfies in portrait or landscape mode without having to rotate your phone, which is a neat feature. There's also dual capture, so you can record with the front and rear cameras at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life is up, and you get up to 30 hours, which is eight hours more than the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. Charging is faster too, and with a 40W adapter, you can charge to 50 percent in 20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
At &#36;799, the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; offers quite a few pro-level features, which makes it a steal for the price. It's definitely worth considering if you're upgrading from an older phone.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-17">iPhone 17 (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/19/review-week-with-iphone-17/">Review: A Week With the iPhone 17</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-a-week-with-the-iphone-17.2466567/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
