<p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance arrived in Baku on February 10 and met Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. The two leaders signed a strategic partnership charter during the visit. The stop came after Vance’s visit to neighboring Armenia, as Washington tries to shore up a U.S.-brokered peace process between Armenia and Azerbaijan after an earlier deal tied to the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute—an agreement President Donald Trump has touted among the eight wars he says he ended. Coverage also cast the trip as a mix of diplomacy and a push to deepen U.S. engagement through trade, energy, and security cooperation in both countries.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/A3h_5JUP1GPX3SGAPJiJkY1J8iBo2ZCqYiNT9Wac7CZwtlufZ4Knwfwx6IGKsrG_x3PNHr4vs4KUxqGaPXc01oT6ESA2J9RsVpqqoikhKeIxh1fSeI579gxXkqwsOxybKk5fjwp2hvxaHv-8MCe-zk1r7hci_W2svEkcQpw7950TnqXBnI-7akFcE-Ola8KrdgfBH6jrlGMxSLjJoELfbWXbz9nCFWo' alt='U.S. Vice President JD Vance meets Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in Baku after signing a strategic partnership charter.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Charter scope: France 24 said the strategic partnership agreement signed in Baku covers economic and security cooperation.</li><li>Transit corridor: RFE/RL said the U.S. is also promoting a strategic transit corridor it sees as key to shifting regional trade, energy flows, and influence in the South Caucasus.</li><li>Deal timeline: AllSides (citing Newsweek) described the trip as a follow-up to an August deal linked to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.</li><li>Geopolitical framing: AllSides framed the visit as taking place in “Russia’s backyard,” highlighting how sensitive the region is in great-power competition.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Azerbaijan government: Aliyev hosted Vance in Baku, and the two leaders delivered remarks after signing the strategic partnership charter, as shown by PBS.
