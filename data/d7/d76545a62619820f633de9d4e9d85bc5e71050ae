<p>Good and thoughtful graphic essay by Matthew Inman, expressing why he dislikes AI-generated art. It’s been widely <a href="https://kottke.org/25/10/0047680-the-oatmeals-take-on-ai">linked to</a>, largely approvingly. I fundamentally disagree with the premise. Near the start, Inman writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I consume AI art, it <em>also</em> evokes a feeling. Good, bad,
neutral — whatever.</p>

<p>Until I find out that it’s AI art.</p>

<p>Then I feel deflated, grossed out, and maybe a little bit bored.
This feeling isn’t a choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it very much is a choice. If your opinion about a work of art changes after you find out which tools were used to make it, or who the artist is or what they’ve done, you’re no longer judging the art. You’re making a choice not to form your opinion based on the work itself, but rather on something else. If you refuse to watch Woody Allen movies because of his personal life, that’s a choice, but you’re choosing not to watch <a href="https://www.avclub.com/amc-diane-keaton-annie-hall-somethings-gotta-give-re-release">some</a> of the <a href="https://woodyallen.com/manhattan/">best</a> <a href="https://woodyallen.com/match-point-2/">movies</a> that have <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/crimes-and-misdemeanors-1989">ever</a> been made.</p>

<p>Stanley Kubrick said, “The test of a work of art is, in the end, our affection for it, not our ability to explain why it is good.” If an image, a song, a poem, or video evokes affection in your heart, and then that affection dissipates when you learn what tools were used to create it, that’s not a test of the work of art itself. To me it’s no different than losing affection for a movie only upon learning that special effects were created digitally, not practically. Or whether a movie — or a photograph — was shot using a digital camera or on film. Or whether a novel was written using a computer or with pen and paper.</p>

<p>I think most “AI art” today completely sucks. But not because it was made using AI generation tools. It just sucks period. Good art is being made with AI tools, though, and more — much more — is coming.</p>
