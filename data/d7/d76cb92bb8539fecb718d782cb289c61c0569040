Following Apple's one-line announcement earlier today that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/13/apple-tv-plus-rebrand/">Apple TV+ is being rebranded as simply Apple TV</a> with a "vibrant new identity," the first hints of that vibrancy have appeared in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/13/apple-seeds-ios-26-1-beta-3/">latest betas seeded shortly after</a>.<br/>

The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app icons and other visuals across the latest releases like iOS 26.1 and tvOS 26.1 beta 3 have adopted a hint of glasslike multicolor, replacing the previous subdued gray theme.<br/>
<br/>
The rebrand has also appeared on <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/about/">press pages for the Apple TV service</a>, but it has not yet propagated to <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-plus/">consumer-focused pages</a>.<br/>

It remains to be seen whether there will be additional components to the rebranding beyond the name and logo changes, but if there are, we should be seeing them fairly soon.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/13/apple-tv-vibrant-icon/">Apple TV&#039;s &#039;Vibrant&#039; Rebranding Starts to Appear in Latest iOS 26.1 Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tvs-vibrant-rebranding-starts-to-appear-in-latest-ios-26-1-beta.2469046/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
