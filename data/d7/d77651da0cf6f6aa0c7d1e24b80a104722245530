The device shows app icons and an active wi-fi symbol. The child is holding — nearly dropping — a small teddy bear. The parent is saying “Here ya go, son”. Text across the bottom reads “Don’t be so…” — a reference to the 1983 Australian Crawl song, “Reckless”" width="2118" height="1656"></p>

<p>Intentional parenting is something I feel strongly about. I believe that any time a child has access to a device (especially an internet-enabled device) the adult/s responsible for them should curate and supervise what material they are accessing, who they are communicating with, and how long they are spending on the device.</p>
<p>My grandchildren have excellent attention spans, good imaginations, and appreciate low-tech play. I truly believe this is in no small part because their parents follow this principle.</p>
