<p>My sincere thanks to The Ole Independence Hall Hooligans for sponsoring this past week at DF to promote democracy. That’s it. A real sponsorship, real money, raised by a group of readers who simply wanted the ad space on DF to promote, as they described it, “the enduring and aspirational project that is democracy.”</p>

<p>In <a href="https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/03/democracy">their sponsored RSS entry</a> to start the week, they quoted <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript">the preamble to the US Constitution</a>. I’ll go a decade earlier, and quote from <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript">the Declaration of Independence</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of
repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the
establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove
this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>

<p>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and
necessary for the public good. [...]</p>

<p>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of
their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. [...]</p>

<p>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p>

<p>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p>

<p>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</p>

<p>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended
offences:</p>
</blockquote>

There is no greater threat to democracy itself than a delusional mad king, whether he wears a crown or a ridiculous ugly red cap. Take action and make your voice heard now — democracy in action is democracy’s only defense.</p>
