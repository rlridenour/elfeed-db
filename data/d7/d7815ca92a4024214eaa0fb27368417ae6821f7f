<p>Emacs 29 <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-29s-sqlite-mode">introduced the handy sqlite-mode</a>. Soon after, I tried a couple of experiments <a href="https://xenodium.com/further-sqlite-mode-extensions/">here</a> and <a href="https://xenodium.com/sqlite-mode-goodies">there</a> to bring additional functionality.</p>
<p>Folks reached out. The additions seemed useful to them and were keen on upstreaming or pushing to MELPA. While I can't commit to upstreaming at this moment, I can happily meet halfway on MELPA.</p>
<p>As of a couple of days, you can find <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/sqlite-mode-extras">sqlite-mode-extras</a> on <a href="https://melpa.org/#/sqlite-mode-extras">MELPA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/sqlite-mode-extras">GitHub</a>. Contributions <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/sqlite-mode-extras/pulls?q=is%3Apr">totally welcome</a>.</p>
<p>While I haven't heard of issues, please continue treating the package as experimental and exercise safety with your data. Please back up.</p>
