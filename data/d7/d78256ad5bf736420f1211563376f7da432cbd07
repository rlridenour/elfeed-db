<p>An explosion tore through the Nowgam police station in Srinagar late on Friday, killing nine people and injuring dozens while a forensic team and police were examining a cache of confiscated explosives, officials said. Authorities said the materials had been seized earlier in Haryana as part of a broader investigation and described the blast as accidental, ordering a formal probe while urging against speculation. The incident comes days after a separate deadly car explosion in New Delhi, and officials are treating the Srinagar blast as a separate, on-site mishap during evidence handling.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/OQyJUt93eMqajjnFJDWnsz_0vzL9oU1K3rhTFNX37EpZ7CI5ycP6a40-f5xTB0liXUylb0uvcOFym-eBvLX6fnqOLTE18R7hPQk_O5nIs72_qwlDdlaC54V-k6GsT57oIkbLgRKc10KIb7VTIUUCfTW3mPBN_v_FnYk6evRQnmMmjebuchBebERJ_aFMUyzzeQ2GOjAyvsdBx5eWFAiejPDAYbk' alt='Indian paramilitary troops near the site of an explosion in a police station in Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir, late Friday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Victim profile: Officials said most of the dead were police officers and members of the forensic team examining the seized materials, underscoring the risks faced by first responders.</li><li>Injury totals vary: Reports gave slightly different injury counts, with 32 wounded reported by some outlets and 29 by others, reflecting ongoing hospital triage and evolving casualty lists.</li><li>Rescue challenges: Small successive explosions and a fire at the scene delayed immediate rescue operations and damaged the police station and neighboring buildings, officials said.</li><li>Origin of evidence: Authorities said the explosive cache had been seized earlier in Haryana as part of an investigation now being connected to a broader probe, according to reporting on the case.</li></ul><blockquote>Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary. - Nalin Prabhat</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Nalin Prabhat, Jammu and Kashmir police director general: He said the blast appeared to be accidental, ruled out foul play and urged against speculation while ordering an internal probe.
