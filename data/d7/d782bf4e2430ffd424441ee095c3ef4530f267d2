<p>Thailand’s conservative, incumbent-led Bhumjaithai Party won the most seats in Sunday’s general election for the country’s 500-seat House of Representatives, putting Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul in a strong position to try to form the next government through coalition talks. With about 90% of votes counted, tallies and projections cited by outlets put Bhumjaithai at about 194 seats—still short of a majority, and therefore still in need of partners to govern. Several sources frame the result as a conservative comeback after years of turbulence and shifting alliances in Thai politics. Analysts say it could open the door to greater stability—if Anutin can stitch together a workable coalition. The progressive People’s Party came in second (reported at 116 seats in figures cited by TIME). Beyond the race for government, voters also backed the start of a process to draft a replacement for Thailand’s current constitution.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/vbFFg-dudgaQ2japDQbdWHvWCtkreA12_i8km_wWCSiqSt04c4VhBXRrtXRWVh0VDBxjpp4X_WCqeimkgnpDqtqFjwf-C-eNU61xOWZ0' alt='Bhumjaithai Party leader Anutin Charnvirakul sits ahead of a press conference at party headquarters in Bangkok after the election.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Leadership change before the vote: Dawn reported Anutin became prime minister after Paetongtarn Shinawatra of Pheu Thai was ousted over the Cambodia crisis, then dissolved parliament less than 100 days later.</li><li>Snap election context: Dawn reported Anutin moved toward a snap election in mid-December after a Thailand–Cambodia border conflict, as nationalism surged.</li><li>Early standings beyond the top two: Dawn reported preliminary Election Commission results put Bhumjaithai ahead of the People’s Party, with the once-dominant Pheu Thai Party in third.</li><li>Campaign themes: TIME reported Bhumjaithai’s win came amid rising nationalism and economic doldrums, while progressives campaigned to curb the military’s role in politics and business.</li><li>Surprise-win framing and next steps: Al Jazeera and other outlets described the outcome as an unexpected win that quickly shifted attention to the coalition negotiations needed to govern.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul: He told reporters he would accept the public’s decision in giving Bhumjaithai their “confidence” and “trust,” and he positioned the win as inclusive of voters who backed other parties.
