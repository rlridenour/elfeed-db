<p>A Turkish Air Force C-130 military cargo plane crashed in the Sighnaghi area of eastern Georgia near the Azerbaijan border on November 11, 2025, killing all 20 people on board, Turkish officials said. The aircraft had departed Ganja in western Azerbaijan and disappeared from Georgian radar shortly after entering Georgia, with authorities saying it did not transmit a distress signal before going down. Turkish and Georgian teams have begun recovery and investigative work at the site while search-and-rescue and wreckage-recovery operations continue.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/s3TDgsHZ-fwUFr6cLqZs4IRYiH_SUS5gT1m2jA8QiRc5tSjtsn4dyhKhhvmupXQN8GpPdEFhNGPzshebZv75QJQEXjfZY_avXlZutdRetGMd' alt='Wreckage at the crash site of the Turkish C-130 military cargo plane in the Sighnaghi area near the Georgia–Azerbaijan border on November 12, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Eyewitness footage: Video circulated by local media and eyewitnesses appears to show the aircraft spinning and breaking apart mid‑air before impact, images that media outlets published and that authorities are reviewing.</li><li>Time details: Turkish media cited by international outlets reported the plane vanished from radar about 27 minutes after taking off from Ganja airport, giving investigators a narrow window to study communications and flight data.</li><li>Aircraft type: Reports identify the aircraft as a C‑130 Hercules transport — a military cargo plane manufactured by Lockheed Martin — which Turkey uses for personnel and equipment movements.</li><li>Recovery operations: Turkish authorities said recovery and wreckage‑inspection operations are under way in coordination with Georgian officials at the Sighnaghi crash site to gather evidence for a formal investigation.</li></ul><blockquote>Our heroic comrades-in-arms were martyred on November 11, 2025 due to the crash of our C-130 military cargo aircraft, which had taken off from Azerbaijan to return to Turkiye - Defence Minister Yasar Guler</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Turkish Defence Ministry: The ministry released photographs of the 20 personnel and described them as &#x27;heroic comrades‑in‑arms&#x27; who were martyred, while confirming no cause has yet been announced.
