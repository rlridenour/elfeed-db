         <p>This is the video presentation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hyperdrive.el</code> that we prepared for
EmacsConf 2023 together with Joseph Turner:
<a href="https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/hyperdrive/">https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/hyperdrive/</a>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hyperdrive.el</code>
package provides an Emacs interface to the hyperdrive peer-to-peer
filesystem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Joseph introduces the concept of hyperdrive and describes what their
work is about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then I take the stage to present the user-facing basics of managing
hyper drives in Emacs with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hyperdrive.el</code>. I show how to use the
menu, upload a file, navigate the Dired-like buffer of the drive,
edit files, and also talk about how versioning works with
hyperdrive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I give the stage back to Joseph to further elaborate on the
concepts of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hyperdrive.el</code>, including how we can name the drives of
other people and use the mirroring functionality to upload lots of
files at once.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hyperdrive.el</code> to share pictures and video clips that typically
do not get published on my website, either due bandwidth
considerations or because they are small and do not fit into any of
the categories I have (e.g. a ~1 minute clip of an eagle flying above
my hut). The potential of peer-to-peer technology intrigues me. We can
collaborate with others and share files between us without being
dependent on centralised nodes/actors/providers. Here is the link to
my drive:
