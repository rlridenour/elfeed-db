Apple today provided public beta testers with the third release of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a> 26.3 update for testing purposes. The public beta comes a day after Apple provided the third beta to developers.<br/>

After signing up for beta testing on Apple's beta site, public beta testers can download the updates using the Software Update section in the System Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
We don't know about any new features in &zwnj;macOS Tahoe&zwnj; 26.3 as of yet, but Apple might introduce new capabilities in later beta releases. <br/>
<br/>
The beta is limited to developers and public beta testers at the current time, but we are expecting Apple to release the update at the end of January. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-tahoe.250">macOS Tahoe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/27/apple-releases-macos-tahoe-26-3-beta-3-2/">Apple Releases Third macOS Tahoe 26.3 Public Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-third-macos-tahoe-26-3-public-beta.2476737/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
