<p>January was a busy month in the <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/join/">MacSparky Labs</a>!</p>



<p>There were four weekly Lab Reports to keep members up-to-date with Apple news, a Deep Dive on Using Claude Cowork, and videos on topics like Making a List of Calendar Events with Shortcuts and Testing Apple’s Digital Car Key. And much more.</p>



<p>Here’s what took place in the Labs for the month of January 2026:</p>
