The 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference will take place the week of June 9 to June 13, and like the last five years, it will be an online event, although select developers and students will be invited to Apple Park. To kick things off, Apple holds a keynote event on the Monday to announce new software, which is what makes it of interest to the general public.<br/>
<br/>

During the keynote event on Monday, June 9, Apple is expected to unveil iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26. (Apple is changing the naming for its operating system updates –  the "26" represents the September 2025 to September 2026 release season.) The company may also preview its new homeOS operating system, the platform that powers its long-rumored smart home hub.<br/>
