<p>President Donald Trump said he will nominate Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor, to lead the US central bank when current chair Jerome Powell’s term ends in May. The choice tees up a Senate confirmation fight and places renewed attention on how the next chair will steer interest-rate policy in the world’s largest economy. Trump has publicly pressed the Federal Reserve to cut rates faster, while several outlets note that the administration’s pressure campaign has raised questions about the Fed’s political insulation. Markets reacted quickly after the announcement, with reports of a stronger US dollar, softer US equities, and a sharp pullback in precious metals prices.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DfjiowZeBqthAIvDlheQgWhVh-kQ6npEBlLiarr50Bw6fTu3zalWGCEIx9GzQPsl3vgSV1d9y-mQ09A5FDhS6mUoBEXK6crlM44aCK4cfNzvO5M35MEA8Yh-fKEIdmqiFfSMiOGy6rHwOiaJAq8smhb9T-gWLnvSvVUTvxtfUUqsiQm-sJ4UGVevyH34oz4bOEitGSnwViiRp8LXKIdrkv7grZtvpyxJQixPTlq_jfWeLflAl7obVnL8ITT8HOJdbKAdtEZ5nCduB0eZ8Q' alt='File photo of Kevin Warsh speaking at an investment conference in New York City (2017).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Confirmation hurdles: Sen.
