Today we're tracking a pair of solid discounts on the AirPods Pro 2 and AirTag 4-Pack on Amazon, including an all-time low price on the Bluetooth trackers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirTag</h2><br/>

<br/>
Amazon this week has Apple's AirTag 4-Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;64.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;99.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on the accessory.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;34 OFF</div>AirTag 4-Pack for &#36;64.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Amazon also has the AirTag 1-Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CWXNS552%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;24.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;29.00. We've seen a steeper &#36;19.00 price tag on the 1-Pack recently, so if you're in the market for the AirTag, it's likely best to go for the 4-Pack for the best value.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods Pro 2</h2><br/>

Secondly, Amazon has Apple's AirPods Pro 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;169.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. Delivery on this one is delayed slightly to the end of October and early November.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;79 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 for &#36;169.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
This is a solid second-best price on the AirPods Pro 2, coming in about &#36;19 higher compared to the previous record low price, which we haven't seen in a couple of months. <br/>
<br/>
Apple just released the AirPods Pro 3 last month, but we haven't seen particularly steep discounts on the new model yet, so anyone in the market for a Pro model should still find good value in Amazon's discount on the AirPods Pro 2.<br/>
