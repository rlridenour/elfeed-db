<p>I saw <em><a href="https://www.mickey17movie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mickey 17</a> </em>this past weekend, the latest movie by Bong Joon Ho (<em>Parasite</em>), a sci-fi action black comedy which raises issues about personal identity, among (many) other things.<span id="more-53091"></span></p>

<p>The movie is set in the future during an expedition to, and arrival at, a planet several light years away. Humans have figured out how to recreate persons in a manner not unlike Derek Parfit&#8217;s <a href="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/derek-parfit-reasons-and-persons-pp199-202.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teletransporter</a>, and they print out a new copy of the ship&#8217;s &#8220;expendable&#8221;, Mickey, each time he dies doing something too dangerous to have others do.</p>
<p>Fairly early on in the movie, we get something like what Parfit calls a &#8220;branch-line case,&#8221; and there are two Mickeys running around. The film does a good, if brief, job capturing how intuitions about personal identity and teletransportation-like technology may change when confronted with the possibility of multiple copies of a person.</p>
<p>About this possibility, Parfit asks, &#8220;how could a double success be a failure?&#8221; and for a while the movie could be seen as providing an answer to that question (albeit with a different sense of  &#8220;failure&#8221;).</p>
<p>The ethics of person-printing are touched on, slightly, in some narrative flashbacks, but overall, the film doesn&#8217;t spend much time exploring the philosophical issues of its most distinctive technology.</p>
<p>In part that&#8217;s because there&#8217;s way too much going on. I recall an old review of <em>Reasons and Persons</em> in which the author (I forgot who) said it would have been better had it instead been three or four separate books. I doubt that&#8217;s true of Parfit&#8217;s book, but I do think <em>Mickey 17 </em>has enough themes and plot threads for what should have been several movies. There isn&#8217;t a lot of depth or development or subtlety in this movie, unfortunately. Is it at least fun, then? Alas, not really. It was mostly unpleasant. So I&#8217;m reluctant to recommend it. (Perhaps viewers who really go in for really dark humor and have a tolerance for over-the-top caricature will have a different view.)</p>
<p>But if this movie has whetted your appetite for a clever story to watch about personal identity, teletransportation, and moral responsibility, below is a short animated film with the ungoogleable title, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Be_(1990_film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>To Be</em></a>, made by John Weldon and released by the <a href="https://www.nfb.ca/film/to_be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Film Board of Canada</a> in 1990. It&#8217;s quite good. Enjoy!</p>

<p>(Note: I&#8217;ve found the closed-captioning / subtitles are not quite right; you may want to turn them off if you don&#8217;t need them.)</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/03/18/mickey-17-personal-identity-teletransportation-and-to-be/">Mickey 17, Personal Identity, Teletransportation, and To Be</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
