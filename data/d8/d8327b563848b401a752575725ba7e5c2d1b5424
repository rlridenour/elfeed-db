<p>President Donald Trump says he held a lengthy phone call with Venezuela’s interim president Delcy Rodríguez on Wednesday, describing the conversation as positive and his first known direct contact with her since Nicolás Maduro’s ouster. Both sides said the exchange was courteous and productive, and Trump said the two discussed oil, minerals, trade and national security. The call signals a diplomatic opening after recent upheaval in Venezuela, even as questions remain over who will lead the country’s political transition and how quickly conditions will improve for Venezuelans.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/34-drwjakbGkqnLlRuxio9_xFCPde1ROq7RZny3UUB1YKvNMxTzUVurRjZyNH4nhG-S9qHbQ3DqCxlpLZOUoKK_t8vAahp3Vh4dcvh0bRme2H6n68gwLO563qotJk6Fn1DizGOIGMWXZe5-K6vppNEZgcSEshn7SwbCxViKfBqSd_AwwC3nE3ky4A35qL3WtHCdw1jyRC9TLyt3l-uC3HHkEObtelYAJ0ML3vcg' alt='Delcy Rodríguez (left) and María Corina Machado.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>White House meetings: Trump is scheduled to receive Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the White House on Thursday, adding a second track to Washington’s engagement with Venezuela’s new power structure.</li><li>Prisoner releases: Rodríguez said her government will continue releasing people detained under Maduro, presenting the move as part of a shift toward a more open political moment.</li><li>NGO dispute: Rodríguez accused NGOs of misrepresenting the prisoner-release process, while rights groups cited by reports estimate close to 1,000 political prisoners remain in Venezuela.</li><li>Rodríguez profile: Rodríguez previously served as Maduro’s vice president and has been linked in reporting to oversight of intelligence and management of the oil sector—background that shapes how both supporters and critics interpret her promises of a “new era”.</li><li>US strategy focus: One account says the Trump administration has framed control over Venezuelan oil production and exports as a central pillar of its approach, putting energy policy at the heart of the new relationship.</li></ul><blockquote>We just had a great conversation today, and she’s a terrific person - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US President Donald Trump: Trump said the call was “great,” praised Rodríguez personally, and said they discussed oil, minerals, trade and national security as areas for progress between the two countries.
