Following Tuesday's event, new Liquid Glass icons for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>, Clips, GarageBand, iMovie, Keynote, Numbers, and Pages have surfaced on Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> tech spec pages. The new icons appear on the <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-16/specs/">iPhone 16 tech specs page</a> despite that model having no hardware changes, and existing users will presumably see the new icons in app updates that will roll out on Monday alongside <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>. <br/>

These apps come preinstalled on new iPhones but they were not included in the &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; betas and release candidate because they are updated through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. While the spec sheets themselves don't reveal changes beyond the usual pre-installed and downloadable apps, the iconography is unmistakably updated to the latest iOS design set based around Liquid Glass.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the updates are relatively subtle with changes largely limited to the glassiness of the design elements, while a few like Clips and GarageBand have a bit more substantial changes.<br/>

Perhaps notably, there is inconsistency across Apple's product pages. While every &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; model page displays these new icons, all Mac product pages continue to show the current macOS versions of these app icons.<br/>
<br/>
We are not expecting Mac hardware updates until later this year, or more likely early 2026, but with macOS Tahoe being released alongside &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; on Monday, we should see the Liquid Glass app icons coming to Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; apps for Mac as well.<br/>
