<p>Bangladesh will hold its first general election since a 2024 student-led uprising toppled long-time leader Sheikh Hasina, with voting set for February 12 and a 350-seat parliament at stake. With the Awami League now banned from participating, the vote is widely seen as a test of how the country resets after the upheaval—and whether the process can deliver a more credible, competitive contest than in recent years. Campaigning has wrapped up after rival rallies filled Dhaka. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is widely viewed as the frontrunner, while Islamist party Jamaat-i-Islami has emerged as its main challenger through an alliance with the student-linked National Citizen Party (NCP). Many voters, including a large cohort of young and first-time voters, say they’re focused on everyday pressures like inflation, corruption, and economic recovery—and hope the next government can bring stability and a fresh start after a turbulent period.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8rU42EpE830KUBxCQex7bM7vahVLGv-Yljdw1Ak6UzGKoi_vdDlLD9QbDbwwukru8JMZRTgsztUINRgplTzGuOhTJIOyUN-ltjzrcRBo' alt='Shafiqur Rahman, leader of Jamaat-i-Islami, waves to supporters at a Dhaka rally on the final day of campaigning.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of electorate: Election Commission figures cited by RT put registered voters at 127.7 million, in a country of around 173 million people.</li><li>Youth electorate: RT says about 56 million voters (around 44% of the electorate) are ages 18–37, and nearly 5 million will vote for the first time.</li><li>Opinion polls: Firstpost says surveys heading into the final campaign day pointed to a close contest between the BNP and Jamaat-i-Islami.</li><li>Referendum alongside election: RT says the February 12 balloting also includes a referendum that could shape Bangladesh’s future governance.</li><li>Constitutional debate and shifting alliances: Deutsche Welle says long-standing alliances are fraying as constitutional debates intensify ahead of the vote.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP): BNP leader Tarique Rahman told supporters the party has the plan and experience to govern, pointing to his family’s legacy in Bangladeshi politics.
