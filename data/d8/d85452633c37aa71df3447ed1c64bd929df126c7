<p id="p1">Late yesterday, Epic Games and Google announced a settlement of their Google Play Store litigation that, subject to court approval, would open Google&rsquo;s storefront more widely than ever before.</p>
<p id="p2">Like Apple&rsquo;s revisions to its store in response to the European Commission, Google&rsquo;s settlement is complex, but here are some of the highlights, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/813991/epic-google-proposed-settlement" rel="noopener noreferrer">as reported by Sean Hollister for The Verge</a>:</p>
<ul id="ul3"><li>Whereas the U.S. District Court&rsquo;s injunction only applied to the U.S. Play Store, the settlement is global.</li>
<li>The settlement also runs through 2032, which extends beyond the three years ordered by the court.</li>
<li>Google has agreed to reduce its standard fee to 20%, and in some cases, 9% depending on the type of transaction.</li>
<li>Google will create a registration system to allow third-party storefronts.</li>
<li>Developer fees for using Play Billing, Google&rsquo;s payment system, will be separated from the transaction fees.</li>
</ul><p id="p4">As I said, though, there&rsquo;s a lot more to the proposed settlement that you can read in full in the PDF linked in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/813991/epic-google-proposed-settlement" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge&rsquo;s story</a>, and it&rsquo;s subject to court approval, but it does seem to reflect significant concessions by Google.</p>
<p id="p5">What does this mean for Apple and its App Store skirmishes with regulators around the world? Nothing technically; however, contextually, if the settlement is implemented, it should add to the pressure on Apple to open the App Store more widely in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p>
