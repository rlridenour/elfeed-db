<p>I never thought I’d see the day where computer map data would be part of a feature film promotional push, but here we are: Apple’s big-budget Brad Pitt film “F1 The Movie” hits theaters in late June, and the company is making the most of its cross-promotional opportunities with a big update to Monaco in advance of the May 25 running of the Monaco Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Apple’s been slowly rolling out new maps in Apple Maps for areas all around the world, most recently in Thailand last week, including hand-designed 3D landmarks in select cities. Monaco is getting the treatment on Tuesday, similar to the design additions Apple rolled out for Las Vegas in advance of that city’s F1 race last year.</p>
<p>The upgrades come in both permanent and transitory forms. Temporary structures like grandstands will appear and then disappear after the race. The entire race circuit will be highlighted, including road closures and detours during the race. All 19 of the race’s turns will be marked, as well as all the pedestrian bridges over the race. The F1 pit area, which is a permanent structure, will stay on the map all the time. (Apple’s also whimsically placing race cars in various locations throughout the city—presumably, Waldo approves.)</p>
<p>Among the enhanced city designs are 3D models of signs, most of which (in the preview I saw) featured ads for… “F1 The Movie,” of course. That’s synergy! There’s also a new Maps guide that points to several iconic F1 racetracks, including the ones featured in the film, of course.</p>
