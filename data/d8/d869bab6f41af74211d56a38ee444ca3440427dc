<p id="p2">Sky, the AI automation app that <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/sky-for-mac-preview/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federico previewed for MacStories readers in May</a>, has been <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-acquires-software-applications-incorporated/" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired by OpenAI</a>.</p>
<p id="p3">Nick Turley, OpenAI&rsquo;s Vice President &amp; Head of ChatGPT said of the deal in <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-acquires-software-applications-incorporated/" rel="noopener noreferrer">an OpenAI press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  We&rsquo;re building a future where ChatGPT doesn&rsquo;t just respond to your prompts, it helps you get things done. Sky&rsquo;s deep integration with the Mac accelerates our vision of bringing AI directly into the tools people use every day.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">I&rsquo;m not surprised by this development at all. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity have all been developing features similar to what Sky could do for a while now. In addition, Sam Altman was an investor in Software Applications Incorporated, the company behind Sky.</p>
<p id="p6"><a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-acquires-software-applications-incorporated/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ari Weinstein</a> of Software Applications Incorporated, who was one of the co-founders of Workflow, which was later acquired by Apple and became Shortcuts, said of the acquisition:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote7"><p>
  We&rsquo;ve always wanted computers to be more empowering, customizable, and intuitive. With LLMs, we can finally put the pieces together. That&rsquo;s why we built Sky, an AI experience that floats over your desktop to help you think and create. We&rsquo;re thrilled to join OpenAI to bring that vision to hundreds of millions of people.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p8">It&rsquo;s not entirely clear what will become of Sky at this point. OpenAI&rsquo;s press release simply states that the company will be working on integrating Sky&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>
