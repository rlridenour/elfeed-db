The European Union is set to accept the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/26/app-store-eu-rule-change-dma/">June updates that Apple made</a> to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> to comply with the Digital Markets Act, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-set-stave-off-daily-fines-eu-accept-app-store-changes-sources-say-2025-07-22/">Reuters</a></em>. As a result, Apple will not face daily fines for non-compliance.<br/>

Apple changed its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fee setup and removed its anti-steering rules to meet the demands of the European Commission. Developers can now direct customers to purchase options outside the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and even accept payments for digital goods in their apps using third-party payment options.<br/>
<br/>
At the European Commission's direction Apple has split its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; services options to let developers opt out of certain features for a lower fee. There are now two tiers that developers can pay for. The cheaper one eliminates ratings and reviews, &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; featuring and marketing, search suggestions, automatic app updates, and automatic app downloads across devices. The more expensive tier includes all current &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; features and functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Tier 1 store services cost five percent of an app's revenue, and Tier 2 store services cost 13 percent (10 percent for Small Business Program participants). Apple also charges a two percent initial acquisition fee and a five percent Core Technology Commission (CTC). The CTC replaces the CTF, a controversial fee that charged developers €0.50 per app install after one million installs per year.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, there's a split CTC and CTF system for developers who use external links and those who don't, but by January 1, 2026, Apple will have a single business model that includes the services fee, the initial acquisition fee, and the CTC. At maximum, developers will pay 20 percent, and per-install billing won't exist. Developers who choose limited &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; functionality will pay a 12 percent maximum fee. Small Business Program participants will pay between 10 and 15 percent.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple had not changed its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fee structure and linking rules, it could have been fined up to five percent of its average daily worldwide revenue (about €50 million) each day. The European Commission is expected to accept the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; updates "in the coming weeks," but timing could change.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was already fined €500 million for allegedly violating the Digital Markets Act, but the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/apple-appeals-eu-500m-euro-fine/">has filed an appeal</a>. Apple is protesting both the fine and the new anti-steering rules that the European Commission required.<br/>
