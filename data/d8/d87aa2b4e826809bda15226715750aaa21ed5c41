<p>Jonathan V. Last, writing for The Bulwark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The president of the United States gave a speech yesterday before
a group of McDonald’s corporate workers and franchise owners. I’m
going to quote a few sections of his remarks at great length,
because if you have not listened to Trump speaking recently, the
decline in his cognitive abilities is a bit shocking.</p>

<p>The point of this exercise is not to clown on Trump, but to give
everyone a baseline understanding of where he is, with the
mentals, as we try to understand how he will respond to increasing
pressures in the coming months.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPid-oVSSi4">The video of his remarks is here</a> and I’ll include timestamps
for each section, in case you want to see what he looks and
sounds like.</p>

<p>Bottom line: This is a man in noticeable mental decline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole world is inured to listening to Trump speak like this — it sounds normal even to those of us who see that Trump is spiraling into dementia. <em>Ah, that’s just Trump being Trump.</em> But it’s not normal. Reading the transcript is jarring. Also jarring: listening to <a href="https://www.threads.com/@decodingfoxnews/post/DRMQaNzjqsY">Juliet Jeske’s performative reading</a> of a particularly nonsensical portion of Trump’s McDonald’s speech. It’s just gibberish.</p>
