<p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov has been chosen to direct President Trump’s “Board of Peace” for Gaza, a body tied to the ceasefire that took effect in October after more than two years of war between Israel and Hamas. Mladenov previously served as the UN’s envoy for the Middle East peace process from 2015 to 2020, and reports describe him as someone who has worked repeatedly to ease regional tensions. The board is presented in reporting as part of a next phase of the ceasefire framework and is expected to be announced next week, even as deadly Israeli strikes were still reported in Gaza on Thursday.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/QCB1wsbyRVvVKHg8c65olbQOPomPIS5NC_jhB3v0cs7t3JS7ExtsJmFAJQNWyHfMlPCh6LOdI1vh1lfsoSn6mna5d1uyZW3LY2cKE4vPBQas545qWLGSPmrVTrbQn2tI_SxCULgrjvCyU0vnEkgFB75XZNhJSdV5P7oI2OiJAP6xoQ0srGXjxkVkq0VvyOdJu2crlAdXNM3svhnEVhHdAA2s-KAv2Q' alt='Nickolay Mladenov, the Bulgarian diplomat expected to help lead the Gaza peace board.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Jerusalem meetings: Netanyahu met Mladenov in Jerusalem, and Israel’s President Isaac Herzog also held a separate meeting with him, according to Israeli statements and reporting.</li><li>Israel’s conditions: Netanyahu’s office said he “reiterated and clarified” Israel’s position that Hamas must disarm and that Gaza should be demilitarised, referencing President Trump’s “20-point plan”.</li><li>Proposed governance: Reporting describes Trump’s Gaza plan as placing day-to-day governance under a temporary technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee operating under the board’s oversight.</li><li>Possible membership: Axios reported the board could include around 15 world leaders, with countries expected to join including the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt.</li><li>Trust track record: Commentary from a former Bulgarian diplomat and reporting in Israel describe Mladenov as having earned trust with both Israelis and Palestinians during his 2015–2020 UN role.</li></ul><blockquote>Reiterated and clarified that Hamas must disarm and that the Gaza Strip should be demilitarised in accordance with President Trump&#x27;s 20-point plan - Benjamin Netanyahu’s office</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli government (Netanyahu office): Israel says the Gaza framework should include Hamas disarmament and Gaza demilitarisation, and it describes Mladenov as slated to serve as the Gaza-based director general for the body.
