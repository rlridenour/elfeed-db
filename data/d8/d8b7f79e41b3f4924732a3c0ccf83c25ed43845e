<p>It’s Amazon’s annual Prime Day sale, and if you <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday/?tag=df-amzn-20">click through this link</a>, or any of the ones below, you can show your support for Daring Fireball by throwing the referral revenue from any purchases you make my way. You don’t pay a penny more but I get a few percentage points of your purchases. Prime Day discounts are no joke either — we need an outdoor TV for our sun-drenched deck, and I’d been putting off purchasing one out of indecision, but I pulled the trigger and <a href="https://amzn.to/40wWYZp">saved $500</a> with a Prime Day discount last night. (Sometimes my procrastination pays off.)</p>

<p>Just about everything Amazon sells from Apple is being offered at significant discounts. Just a handful of popular ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76BN5D/?tag=df-amzn-20">11-inch M3 iPad Air for $480</a> (regularly $600).</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4lemIlr">iPad Mini (A17 Pro) for $380</a> (regularly $500).</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/44lQIG5">AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation for $120</a> (regularly $180) and the ones without ANC <a href="https://amzn.to/46vrJS4">are just $90</a>. (You should definitely get the ones with ANC, though — I never did write a proper review, but I tested a pair with ANC for <em>months</em> and they’re quite amazing given their price and non-sealed ear fit.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/?tag=df-amzn-20">AirPods Pro 2 are just $150</a> (regularly $250).</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Gt8EFE">13-inch M4 MacBook Airs starting at just $850</a> (regularly $1,000) and the sweet configuration <a href="https://amzn.to/3TrhB5c">with 24 GB RAM and 512 GB storage for $1,250</a> (regularly $1,400). It seems like you save $150 on any MacBook Amazon sells.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even small items like Apple’s <a href="https://amzn.to/4lPsuKh">woven USB-C cables</a> and wired EarPods (<a href="https://amzn.to/4kw3lD8">USB-C</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/3U0PvxI">old-school 3.5mm</a>) are a few bucks off. (I keep a pair of the old 3.5mm EarPods in my laptop bag for use with my <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>, along with Apple’s <a href="https://amzn.to/4f00O3f">$9 USB-C headphone jack adapter</a> (one of the few products I saw that’s not discounted for Prime day, but, come on, it’s $9) in case I ever find myself needing wired buds.)</p>

<p>It’s called Prime Day for a reason: you need to be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime/?tag=df-amzn-20">a Prime subscriber</a> to get these deals. We’ve been members since forever, and the $140/year fee pays for itself in shipping fees alone. But for some high-priced items like MacBooks and iPads, you can make up the entire annual fee in one purchase today.</p>

<p>I don’t post a ton of affiliate links here on DF, but when I do, they sometimes work out to a nice windfall. As the media industry moves more and more toward subscriptions and memberships — and, alas, paywalled content — I’m still freely publishing the entirety of my work other than <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Dithering</a>. I really do get asked by readers on a regular basis how they can support Daring Fireball directly. I’ll do a new round of t-shirts and maybe some other merch soon. That’s one way. I might someday offer a membership tier with bonus content (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/06/something_daring">again</a>), but that day is not today. But one way you can support DF directly today is by buying anything — anything at all — from Amazon after clicking through any of the above links.</p>
