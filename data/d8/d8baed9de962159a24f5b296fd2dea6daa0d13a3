<p>In <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_0446342181/page/140/mode/2up?view=theater"><em>Strictly Speaking</em></a> (1974), Edwin Newman points out that the names of American college presidents are strangely interchangeable: Columbia&#8217;s Nicholas Murray Butler would have projected the same impressive dignity if he&#8217;d been Nicholas Butler Murray or Butler Nicholas Murray. Kingman Brewster, president of Yale, might as well have been Brewster Kingman. Newman gives five pages of examples, drawn from the 1973 Yearbook of Higher Education:</p>
<p>Brage Golding, California State University<br />
Harris L. Wofford, Jr., Bryn Mawr College<br />
Thurston E. Manning, University of Bridgeport<br />
Gibb Madsen, Hartnell College<br />
Rexer Berndt, Fort Lewis College<br />
Dumont Kenny, Temple Buell College<br />
Woodfin P. Patterson, Jefferson Davis State Junior College<br />
Imon E. Bruce, Southern State College<br />
Cleveland Dennard, Washington Technical Institute<br />
Culbreth Y. Melton, Emmanuel College<br />
Pope A. Duncan, Georgia Southern College<br />
Hudson T. Armerding, Wheaton College<br />
Landrum R. Bolling, Earlham College<br />
Mahlon A. Miller, Union College<br />
Dero G. Downing, Western Kentucky University<br />
Wheeler G. Merriam, Franklin Pierce College<br />
Placidus H. Riley, St. Anselm&#8217;s College<br />
Ferrel Heady, University of New Mexico<br />
Lane D. Kilburn, King&#8217;s College<br />
Hilton M. Briggs, South Dakota State University<br />
Granville M. Sawyer, Texas Southern University</p>
<p>&#8220;Note also that the names are interchangeable up, down, diagonally, taking every other name, every third, fourth, fifth, and so on, at random, and &#8212; for parlor game purposes &#8212; any other way you can think of. In mixed clusters of three, especially when read or sung aloud, they are often enchanting.&#8221;</p>
