Apple product retailer B&H is <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=homepod%20mini&sts=ma">listing all HomePod mini models</a> as discontinued, and no longer offering them for sale. Some other retailers are also listing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> as out of stock or on backorder, which suggests that an update isn't too far off.<br/>

Apple is rumored to be working on a new version of the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;, and <em>Bloomberg</em> said it could come <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/02/new-apple-tv-and-homepod-mini-launching-soon/">as soon as this month</a>. It's possible that the waning stock at third-party retailers is a sign that we'll get a new version of the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; before the end of 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Apple held an event in September and did a series of product releases in October, casting some doubt that a new model is still on the immediate horizon.<br/>

The next &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is expected to have an upgraded S-series chip inside and Apple's N1 networking chip, but there are no design changes rumored except for refreshed color options.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/10/homepod-mini-discontinued-b-and-h/">B&amp;H Lists HomePod Mini as Discontinued Amid Refresh Rumors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/b-h-lists-homepod-mini-as-discontinued-amid-refresh-rumors.2470908/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
