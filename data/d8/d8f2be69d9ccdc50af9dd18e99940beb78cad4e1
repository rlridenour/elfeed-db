Technical texts on the latest engineering developments to improve services dominate the literature on managing water utilities. <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/marketing/engineering-marketing-interface/">Engineers</a> often see marketing as peripheral to their quest to provide a reliable and safe water supply. It is therefore a delight to read a book on how to improve services in water utilities using the human dimension.</p>

Communicating Water&#39;s Value
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Uakma0">Communicating Water&#39;s Value: Talking Points,Tips &amp; Strategies</a> by Melanie Goetz is based on a sound basis of years of experience, backed by the latest scientific findings in behavioural economics, neuromarketing and related disciplines. This book is by no means a nerdy academic treatise. The countless vivid examples from Melanie&#39;s experience in working with utilities will appeal to water utility professionals.</p>
<p>
The book delves into the non-rational (a term I prefer above &#39;irrational&#39;) aspects of human psychology. Melanie clearly explains how the techniques used in competitive commercial organisations can also enhance the value proposition of water utilities.</p>
<p>
Marketing has earned itself a bad name for being deceptive and manipulative. This negative image is one of the reasons public services often don&#39; t use marketing. Melanie&#39;s book shows, however, that good marketing can tap into the forces of psychology and be used for good instead of evil.</p>
<p>
Melanie recognised in the book that her work is &#34;preaching to the choir&#34;. Engineers, economists and accountants and other professional that operate at a distance from customers should read this book. As pointed out in the latter part of the book, innovation can only arise from positive deviance. Daring to be different and breaking the shackles of tradition is difficult in an industry where tradition dominates thinking.</p>

The Value of Water
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Reading this book, I latched on to one little phrase: &#34;We do not sell water, we sell status—we sell a solution for thirst&#34;. When a utility recognises that they do not sell water, but the benefits that water provides, they are on their way to maximise the value perception held by their customers. Thinking of water as merely the product they supply, instead of the benefits it provides is an example of <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/marketing/marketing-myopia/">marketing myopia</a>, a form of short-sightedness that can only be fixed by using marketing glasses.</p>
<p>
My version of this idea is: &#34;We don&#39;t sell water, we sell <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/marketing/value-of-water/">experiences</a>&#34;. We sell good ideas (in the shower), we sell initiate moments (having a bath with someone you love), we sell personal fulfilment (gardening) and so on. Status comes into play only with conspicuous purchases, such as a pool.</p>
<p>
When looking at a water utility using marketing lenses we see the service as the customers perceive it. Not the way customers might consciously understand water, but subconsciously. In <em>Communicating Water&#39;s Value</em>, demonstrates the psychological subtleties involved in managing the attitudes and behaviours of customers.</p>
<p>
This book is a great read for every water utility professional who wants to practice some <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/positive-workplace-deviance/">positive organisational deviance</a>. Melanie Goetz&#39;s work will help you to think differently and increase the value proposition of customers. Not by investing millions in new gadgets, but by levering human psychology.</p>
