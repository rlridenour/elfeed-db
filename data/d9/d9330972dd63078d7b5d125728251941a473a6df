(denote-sequence.el)</a>),
I introduced the new optional extension for Denote, which streamlines
the creation of file names with an inherent hierarchical relationship.
This is expressed as a numeric sequence, where each level of depth is
delimited by the equals sign. So <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1=1=2</code> refers to the second child of
the first child of the parent note <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>.</p>

<p>A popular sequencing scheme is to combine numbers with letters
(Luhmann-style folgezettel). This alphanumeric expression is more
compact, though it might also be a bit harder to reason about. For
example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1a2</code> is the same as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1=1=2</code>, which looks clean, but it gets
tricky once you reach <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1za5zx</code> which is equivalent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1=27=5=50</code>.</p>

<p>Unlike the numeric scheme where there is an explicit depth delimiter
(the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code>), the alphanumeric scheme establishes depth by alternating
between numbers and letters. Thus, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1a2</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1=1=2</code> are both three
levels of depth.</p>

<p>I am in the process of giving users the option. They will be able to
pick their sequencing scheme and then produce notes, re-parent them,
and so on, with Denote taking care to use/generate the correct
sequence each time.  In principle, the two schemes are interoperable
and there will be relevant commands to switch between them.</p>

<p>[ <strong>UPDATE 2025-01-12 11:25 +0200:</strong> Now merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> and
  deleted the feature branch. ]</p>

<p>Below is the commit I worked on today. For now it lives in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alphanumeric-sequence-extension</code>
branch: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/tree/alphanumeric-sequence-extension">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/tree/alphanumeric-sequence-extension</a>.
I will merge it into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> as soon as I am done with the user-facing
parts, which I will probably do tomorrow or early next week. If you
are interested to try out what is now available, please check the
source code and let me know your thoughts.</p>

  Make the groundwork for alphanumeric (Luhmann) sequences in denote-sequence.el

  The idea is to support both numeric and alphanumeric sequencing
  schemes, as documented in the new user option 'denote-sequence-scheme'.

  We now have the tools to correctly split, join, increment, and convert
  input accordingly, such that we can, for example, accurately produce a
  child of sequence "1a2" (we could already do that for numeric
  sequences).

  What is covered herein is just the groundwork. I still need to extend
  the helper functions which directly support the creation of new
  parent, child, or sibling sequences. While this still is a lot of
  work, the hard part is now done.

<h2>About Denote</h2>

<p>Denote is a simple note-taking tool for Emacs.  It is based on the idea
that notes should follow a predictable and descriptive file-naming
scheme.  The file name must offer a clear indication of what the note is
about, without reference to any other metadata.  Denote basically
streamlines the creation of such files while providing facilities to
link between them.</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a consistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>
