<p>Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton have told the Republican‑led House Oversight Committee that they are now willing to sit for closed‑door depositions in its investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after previously refusing to comply with subpoenas for in‑person testimony. Their lawyers emailed the panel on Monday saying the couple would appear on mutually agreed dates, prompting House leaders to pause, but not yet cancel, preparations for a vote to hold them in contempt of Congress. Committee chair James Comer said he would continue pursuing criminal contempt resolutions until a formal written agreement on the timing and conditions of the depositions is finalized. The Clintons have argued that the inquiry is politically motivated and intended to deflect attention from President Trump, while Republicans say they are examining how authorities historically handled Epstein‑related allegations involving powerful figures.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/S6cPuj_D0zMt1tFfSr2VZitap_vnfCTa-fEUwhl8cdftFIJfObBwqWsUTTZ7qPBHfbm0sPliyleuPeEz0k9NOD8YWfKUfrBzOtQZkC7wu4AIYumeBL_w6rkN6tEWx8rd6o-nNagCbaIHucn2dbvqBn_0SFMzbTOQeiR_UKcP4RHf-AHHMDiQkplWnAO520jJ-T_EXTprm-zuLQon73dkZk1J7fkvxht2WPwOVp2ykyDCcDEnK5F3_0GKqm6j8uyCIn86uSg4nTRQ1WC8MQ' alt='Bill and Hillary Clinton attend a public event in 2024, as they now prepare to testify in the US House investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Contempt threat: The House Rules Committee had started procedural steps toward a floor vote on criminal contempt charges against both Clintons before the announcement of their willingness to testify led to a pause in that process.</li><li>Dispute over format: The Oversight Committee initially demanded private, transcribed depositions, while the Clintons at first indicated they preferred to appear in a public hearing rather than a closed‑door setting.</li><li>Republican rationale: Chair James Comer has framed the Clintons’ testimony as part of a broader effort to show that congressional investigations apply equally to former presidents and senior officials from both parties.</li><li>Clintons’ criticism: Allies of the Clintons have characterized the investigation as an attempt by Republicans to shield President Trump from scrutiny by shifting the focus toward Democrats’ past connections to Epstein.</li><li>Scope of inquiry: Lawmakers say the House investigation is focused on how law enforcement and prosecutors dealt with earlier allegations against Epstein, who maintained links and correspondence with prominent political and business figures before his death.</li></ul><blockquote>The former President and former Secretary of State will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates. - Angelo Roefaro, spokesperson for Bill Clinton</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>James Comer, House Oversight chair: Comer has insisted that, despite the Clintons’ new offer to appear, he will continue to push contempt resolutions until a binding agreement on their depositions is signed, arguing that Congress must enforce its subpoenas consistently.
