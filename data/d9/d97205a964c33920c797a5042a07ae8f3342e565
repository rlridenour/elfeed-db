TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/more-ways-to-spot-shape-and-understand-ai-generated-content">today announced</a> that it will let users limit the amount of AI-generated content that they see in their feeds. There will be a new AI content control toggle in the Manage Topics section of TikTok, with a slider for adjusting the AI content in the For You feed.<br/>

TikTok's Manage Topics section allows users to adjust the content that they see across categories like Dance, Sports, Current Affairs, Fashion, Health, and more. AI will be added as a new option "in the coming weeks."<br/>
<br/>
People who like AI-generated content can opt to see more, while those who want to see less can "dial things down," according to TikTok. There won't be a toggle to turn AI-generated content off entirely.<br/>
<br/>
TikTok is also testing an AI-generated content labeling system called invisible watermarking. Invisible watermarking will prevent labels denoting content as AI-generated from being removed when the content is reuploaded or shared on another platform. The invisible watermark will be harder to remove from metadata.<br/>
<br/>
Invisible watermarks will be added to AI-generated content made with TikTok tools like AI Editor Pro, as well as content uploaded with C2PA Content Credentials.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/19/tiktok-ai-content-limits/">TikTok Adds Toggle to Limit AI Content in For You Feed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-adds-toggle-to-limit-ai-content-in-for-you-feed.2471535/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
