&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is compatible with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 series and later, as well as the second-generation &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE. If you have an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XR, XS, or XS Max, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is your last iOS update. As for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPadOS 26&zwnj; runs on all iPads that support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, with the exception of the 7th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. Apple has also released iOS/iPadOS 18.7, iOS/iPadOS 16.7.12, and iOS/iPadOS 15.8.5 for those unable to upgrade to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's new updates introduce Liquid Glass, the new design language that features a translucent, glass-like look for icons, buttons, menus, and other interface elements across iOS and iPadOS. Liquid Glass is designed to behave like glass does in the real world, dynamically reflecting light and allowing bits of the background to show through.<br/>
<br/>
Safari, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, and the Camera app have simplified navigation, and many apps feature new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> options. Messages, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and Phone all support Live Translation, for example. Messages includes backgrounds and new group chat features, the Phone app can screen calls for you and take over holding when you need to wait for someone.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a> can now understand what's on your screen and answer questions about what you're looking at, and Apple has improved <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a> with new features. The Wallet app is smarter than before and can track all of your orders, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> includes a useful new AutoMix feature for song transitions.<br/>
<br/>
On the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, Apple overhauled multitasking and windowing for a more Mac-like experience. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; apps can be placed anywhere and they have menu bars. The Phone app is now available on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, as is a new Games app. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; also has almost all of the &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; features.
