Apple views software updates as an integral part of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; usage experience. Apple is able to deliver new functionality to older iPhones on a regular basis, plus the frequent updates that Apple rolls out address bugs and ensure the best protection from security vulnerabilities.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that providing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users with new features over multiple years is something that is unique to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; because of the deep integration between hardware and software. Apple views software updates as a way to provide value to customers over a long period of time, enabling them to hold onto their devices for years while still getting new experiences.<br/>
