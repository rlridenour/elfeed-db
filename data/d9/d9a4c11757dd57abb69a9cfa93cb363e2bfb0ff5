<p>Iraqis went to the polls on Tuesday, November 11, to elect a new parliament in voting described as unusually calm but conducted under tight security and amid calls for a boycott. Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al‑Sudani is seeking a second term, but many voters and analysts say they expect little meaningful reform because political power remains divided and the country sits between U.S. and Iranian influence. The vote is being closely watched abroad — Washington has pressed Iraqi leaders to confront Iran‑backed militias, while Tehran is also monitoring the outcome — and legal challenges have been flagged that could delay final confirmation of results.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8hhnuVy_2Va94yL0ZzBC1hCjgzq8ufdeiJQHms-uidx0mPX9akTk7-Aa5WVVGnfg6p-HAvbEY8ryOO34gVMZrC3gTKKSq5I7j1Mvn7lZvIt2HCGUcTKU1rJ0HltckSf6Hw4hRifMNm-9JuksrJJzWEztAFlIVi7Ss9m01FI1EdzLec0diZPBFUt8H9iqvG56xMq9Zx2ubna5KvZZA-E_raK5' alt='Campaign posters in central Baghdad promoting candidates for the parliamentary elections.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Lower turnout: Officials recorded about 2.5 million fewer potential voters on the rolls than in 2021, raising turnout and legitimacy concerns.</li><li>Legal uncertainty: The head of Iraq&#x27;s Supreme Judicial Council has described the vote as unconstitutional, meaning results may face court challenges after polling.</li><li>Militias central: The future government&#x27;s stance toward Iran‑backed militias is a central issue, with U.S. officials urging disarmament and political limits on those groups.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iraqi voters / public: Many voters expressed little hope for major change from the ballot, citing entrenched political elites and foreign influence as obstacles.
