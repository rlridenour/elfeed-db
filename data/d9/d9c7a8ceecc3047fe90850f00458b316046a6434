<p>The award is given by <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Library of Humanities</a>, the diamond open access publisher of <a href="https://freeandequaljournal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Free &amp; Equal</em></a>, <a href="https://politicalphilosophyjournal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Political Philosophy</em></a>, and other journals. This year, three researchers were recognized for &#8220;exceptional commitment to open access,&#8221; and provided with support for their open-access related projects.</p>
<p>Dr. Kind received the award for his project, &#8220;Open Philosophy.&#8221; The award <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/news/857/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The project Open Philosophy aims to inform about, promote, and encourage open access in academic philosophy. The field is experiencing a growing number of open access journals hosted by university libraries, independent scholars, and organisations such as the Open Library of Humanities&#8230; For these journals to thrive, they require increased recognition within academia through greater awareness, support from scholars who see open access as a public good, and high-quality submissions that boost their credibility and impact.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Funding from the Open Library of Humanities will enable Open Philosophy to support the open access philosophy community through a sustained initiative to build a collaborative network. Planned activities include the development of a homepage listing open access philosophy journals, a search engine dedicated to these journals, a series of podcast interviews, a blog, and an annual “Open Philosophy Prize.”</em></p>
<p>Dr. Kind writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em> The first steps I’m taking at the moment are to reach out to Diamond OE journals that want to be listed in the project and would support the prize committee next year. A homepage will be developed over the rest of this year. Next year, once the homepage is up, I also want to start interviewing editors of OE journals about their publishing models, experiences, and thoughts on publishing philosophy.</em></p>
<p>The other two prizes were awarded for creating a series of workshops in Malaysia, Pakistan, and Singapore focused on diamond open access publishing in the humanities, and for curating an exhibition at Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) aimed at raising awareness of humanities research data and the importance of making it openly available.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/09/25/philosopher-wins-open-access-award/">Philosopher Wins Open Access Award</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
