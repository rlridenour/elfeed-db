<p>Border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia have entered a third day, with artillery exchanges and air strikes along disputed frontier areas killing at least 11–13 people and forcing more than half a million residents on both sides to evacuate to temporary shelters across multiple provinces. Both governments accuse each other of targeting civilians and violating a Trump-brokered ceasefire agreed earlier this year, and leaders in Bangkok and Phnom Penh say they are prepared to continue fighting if necessary despite mounting displacement. President Trump, speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, said he plans to &quot;make a phone call&quot; to the Thai and Cambodian leaders in an effort to restore the truce and touted his broader record of involvement in international conflicts. The US government has separately called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a return to de-escalation measures laid out in earlier peace accords, while Cambodian officials state they are ready for talks and Thai officials publicly voice skepticism about outside mediation.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PjCLZ3MYKw8c997Ktzz21o5v2X3d7FXvVlkAShHnb9sdCEHGtnP5PIJR55idK2tLiMw_boyzsSUJHTS5pzHuy82t4fHy12lKr_-wugxB8kJw' alt='President Donald Trump speaks in Pennsylvania, where he pledged to call Thai and Cambodian leaders about renewed border fighting.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale of evacuations: Officials in both countries report that population movements triggered by the renewed fighting already exceed those seen in earlier 2025 clashes, with authorities urgently relocating border communities to safer inland camps and schools repurposed as shelters.</li><li>Use of heavy weaponry: Thai forces have used F‑16 fighter jets and artillery after accusing Cambodia of firing BM‑21 rockets that landed near a hospital in Thailand’s Surin region, while Cambodia alleges Thai strikes hit civilian areas and prompted it to pull its athletes from the Southeast Asian Games in Thailand.</li><li>Ceasefire history: The current escalation comes less than two months after renewed hostilities broke a ceasefire President Trump brokered in October, which itself followed an earlier truce in July that had paused deadly border engagements earlier in the year.</li><li>US political framing: At his Pennsylvania rally, President Trump framed the Thai‑Cambodian conflict as one of eight international wars he claims to have helped end, citing past involvement in disputes such as between Kosovo and Serbia, Pakistan and India, and Israel and Iran.</li><li>Local uncertainty: Thai evacuees interviewed in Surin province describe waiting in crowded shelters with limited information on when they can safely return home, as sporadic explosions are still heard near the frontier and officials say conditions are not yet secure.</li></ul><blockquote>Who else could say I’m going to make a phone call and stop a war of two very powerful countries, Thailand and Cambodia. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Thailand: Thailand’s foreign minister said he saw no potential for negotiations at present and argued the situation was not suitable for third‑party mediation, while officials accused Cambodia of firing rockets into Thai territory and endangering civilians near a hospital in Surin province.
