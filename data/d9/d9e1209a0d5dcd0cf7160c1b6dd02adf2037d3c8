Anil Dash has a long post on <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/09/how-markdown-took-over-the-world/">How Markdown Took Over The World</a>. We Org mode users may have a few problems with that depiction but it <i>is</i> fair to say that Markdown usage has become ubiquitous. We see it everywhere, even in the most unexpected places.
</p>
<p>
The most interesting part of Dash&rsquo;s post, to me, is his history of Markdown. In the tradition of open source software, it began as an itch on the part of a user. John Gruber wanted an easier way of writing his blog <a href="https://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>. The original markdown was a perl script that translated some simple markup text into HTML.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, I&rsquo;d say that the real genius of Markdown is that it&rsquo;s plain text. That means you don&rsquo;t need a bespoke application to use it. You can use your preferred method of entering text to write your Markdown source. It&rsquo;s other winning aspect is that nobody &ldquo;owns&rdquo; it. Anybody can use it or incorporate into their application without fuss or fee.

<p>
We Org mode aficionados prefer Org markup, of course. I&rsquo;m inclined to think that the syntax of Org mode versus Markdown isn&rsquo;t that much of an issue but <a href="https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/">others <i>strongly</i> disagree</a>. For me, the advantage of Org mode is it&rsquo;s power—to which some dialects of Markdown are slowly catching up—and it&rsquo;s close integration with Emacs, which is where I do all my writing.
</p>
<p>
The other big advantage of Org mode is that there is only one. Sadly, Markdown has several incompatible dialects so it&rsquo;s hard to know which version to master or use. On the other hand, Markdown is not tied to any particular application so you can use it anywhere. It <i>is</i> technically true that you can write Org mode in any editor and translate it to almost any target with <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> but as a practical matter if you want to use Org mode, you need to use Emacs.
</p>
<p>
This post is an ecumenical moment where we celebrate the <i>huge</i> advantages of Markdown and Org mode over their mostly proprietary competitors. We may argue over which is best but we agree that they&rsquo;re better than their alternatives.</p>
