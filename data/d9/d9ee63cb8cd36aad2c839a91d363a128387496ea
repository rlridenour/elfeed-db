The creators of Shortcuts, an app that was acquired by Apple and deeply integrated into iOS and macOS, today <a href="https://sky.app">unveiled their latest project</a>, Sky. Sky provides an AI helper that can assist you with everything that you do on your Mac.<br/>

Sky is designed to float unobtrusively over what you're doing, so AI is just a click away. It understands what's on your Mac's screen, and is able to take actions using the apps that you have installed. It's able to help with answering questions, writing, planning, coding, and much more, and it can be customized with prompts, scripts, and shortcuts.<br/>
<br/>
Sky knows what apps you have open, what you're doing, and what actions are possible based on that information. Sky has built-in integrations for Calendar, Messages, Notes, Safari, Finder, Mail, and screenshots, so it is able to do things like make a calendar event for a dinner based on a conversation you've had, and look up an ideal place to go. Custom prompts and tools integrate natively with Sky, and the AI can take into account everything it's been given when performing tasks.<br/>

<em>MacStories</em>' Federico Viticci was <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/sky-for-mac-preview/">able to test Sky</a>, and he said that it's an app that's going to "fundamentally change" his macOS workflow and the way he uses automation day-by-day. Viticci provided an example of the way Sky can simplify a task.<br/>
<br/>
Sharing a link to an article in Safari requires a multi-step process, but rather than going through the Share Sheet and sending a message, you're able to tell Sky to send a link and a summary to [person]. Sky gets the link, summarizes the webpage, and sends an iMessage to the specified person in natural language, all with one command. There are a wide range of tasks that Sky can complete thanks to deep integration with <em>any</em> app, including Finder.<br/>
<br/>
Sky works with either GPT 4.1 or Claude, but with its deep macOS integration, it is able to do more than one of the LLMs alone. The app supports creating custom tools with natural language, which makes it accessible to anyone. Sky is also able to use Claude to create customized tools using shell scripts and AppleScripts.<br/>

Pricing has not yet been announced, but the app is expected to have a free component.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/sky-ai-mac-app/">Shortcuts Creators Debut Sky, an AI Helper That Understands Everything on Your Mac&#039;s Screen</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/shortcuts-creators-debut-sky-an-ai-helper-that-understands-everything-on-your-macs-screen.2457843/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
