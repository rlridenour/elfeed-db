<p>The Trump administration has proposed a US-led “critical minerals” trading bloc with allies and partners. The pitch: coordinated reference prices (including price floors) and tariff tools to reduce reliance on supply chains that Washington says are overly concentrated in one country. The plan came up at an inaugural ministerial-style meeting in Washington that drew representatives from more than 50 countries. US officials framed it as a way to make the market “healthier” and more competitive, and to encourage long-term investment by smoothing out price swings. Several partners signaled interest in exploring the idea, including Japan, Mexico and the European Union, as the US also moves to build buffers at home through a new strategic stockpile initiative. The practical takeaway: governments are trying to make the raw materials behind semiconductors, electric vehicles and defense systems more predictable—potentially strengthening resilience for manufacturers—while also raising the risk of trade tensions if major producers see the approach as discriminatory.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qfxtyJVXi8LHBFfi77qD6V5ZfsWE91b-tf9ZyRghCuhBPGhYMjc4-0lIvluTy5gZojHHhFz1CPZsH9qlcVdS79u1R-KRJL29Jprv0iAi' alt='US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks at the inaugural Critical Minerals Ministerial meeting.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Strategic stockpile: Semafor reported President Trump announced a $12 billion critical mineral stockpile initiative days before the Wednesday talks.</li><li>April China trip: Semafor reported a China expert wrote that Trump will want agreements in place before his April visit to China, to signal Beijing’s leverage is fading against a united front.</li><li>Pakistan hedges: Pakistan was briefed on the proposal but had not signed on.
