Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> could feature 50% more memory than its predecessor, according to Korea's <a href="https://www.thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=202510231456578160101612&lcode=00&page=1&svccode=00"><em>The Bell</em></a>.<br/>

With its latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max feature 12GB of memory. This is a significant increase of 4GB more their predecessors, largely driven by the demands of on-device artificial intelligence processing.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> is the only new model to continue to feature 8GB of memory. It looks like that will change with the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj;, with Apple reportedly seeking memory parity across all four models. Apple has apparently asked Samsung, a key supplier of RAM for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, to increase its supply of LPDDR5X chips for the next &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's high-performance LPDDR5X launched in 2024 is only available in 12GB and 16GB configurations, making another standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with 8GB of memory unlikely. Apple is also said to be in talks with SK Hynix and Micron for additional mobile DRAM supply.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; 2, &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro, &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max, and foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; are expected to launch in the fall of 2026, with the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18e following in the first half of 2027.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thebell-co-kr/">The Bell</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/25/iphone-18-to-feature-more-ram/">iPhone 18 Rumored to Feature 50% More RAM</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-rumored-to-feature-50-more-ram.2469788/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
