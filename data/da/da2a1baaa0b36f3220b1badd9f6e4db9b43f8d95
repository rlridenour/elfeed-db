<p>Today, I passed the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/life-in-the-uk-test">Life in the UK test</a>. Wasn't quite sure how to study for it. During my commutes, I listened to the <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Life-in-the-UK-2019-Test-Contains-the-Official-Course-300-Practice-Questions-Audiobook/B07VD9SR3L">Life in the UK 2019 Test audio book</a>.</p>
<p>A friend recommended <a href="https://lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk">lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk</a>. Overall, I found their practice tests very useful. Taking a bunch tests helped me internalize the material.</p>
<p>Took some notes along the way (mostly data with years attached) and dumped it into an <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Built_002din-Table-Editor.html#Built_002din-Table-Editor">org table</a>. This helped me form a mental timeline.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>These tables alone are <strong>not</strong> comprehensive enough to prepare for the exam. You'll need to know additional information without dates attached.</em></p>
