<p>What&#8217;s one thing that could make ICE agent Jonathan Ross&#8217;s lethal shooting of innocent US citizen Renee Good even worse? If it were legally justified.</p>

<p>How would this make it worse?</p>
<p>The shooting was a horrific event. If it were determined to be legally justified, then</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(a) it would be harder, if not impossible, to hold anyone properly accountable for it happening,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(b) it would become less likely that any kind of amends would be made to Renee Good&#8217;s family,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(c) it would increase the likelihood of similarly horrific events happening, by telling agents they have sufficient legal cover to be less cautious with others&#8217; lives,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(d) it would likely discourage people from observing ICE to witness (and perhaps, via witnessing, calm) their actions, and discourage people from protesting ICE,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(e) it would suggest that the problem with ICE is bigger than you might have thought; addressing it involves not just getting agents to comply with existing laws and policies but to change those laws and policies, and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(f) it would weaken the extent to which Good&#8217;s killing could be used for what you might think are beneficial political ends, e.g., to use its awfulness to motivate political or social efforts to rein in the now Gestapo-like ICE.</p>
<p>But why countenance this? Does anyone really think Good&#8217;s killing was legally justifiable?</p>
<p>As it turns out, plenty of people do. A <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/majority-americans-ice-agents-shooting-good-unjustified-inappropriate/story?id=129253596" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> last week found that 35% of registered voters, and 77% of Republican party supporters, think the shooting was legally justified. And so do some philosophers.</p>
<p>In a guest post at the <a href="https://flyoverphilosophy.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newsletter</a> of <a href="https://www.dandemetriou.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan Demetriou</a> (University of Minnesota, Morris), <a href="https://timhsiao.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Hsiao</a>, currently a fellow at the Firearms Research Center at the University of Wyoming College of Law (and previously an assistant professor of philosophy), argues that &#8220;<a href="https://flyoverphilosophy.substack.com/p/why-the-minneapolis-ice-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the shooting was justified.</a>&#8221; (Of course to say an action is <em>legally </em>justified is not thereby to say it is <em>morally </em>justified, or to say that it wasn&#8217;t <em>bad</em>.)</p>
<p>Hsiao says that the law permits ICE agents to &#8220;stop and detain someone <em>even if they haven’t actually been confirmed to have committed a crime</em>. There only needs to be reasonable grounds, based on articulable facts, to suspect that a crime might have been committed.&#8221; He argues that there were such reasonable grounds in the Renee Good incident, justifying the agents&#8217; attempts to detain Good. He then argues that it was &#8220;reasonable for Jonathan Ross to believe that Renee Good’s movements [with her car] constituted an imminent threat of serious physical harm or death,&#8221; which, he says, is the standard for officers to be legally justified in using deadly force. But what about the fact that the officer fired multiple shots at Good when he was obviously next to the car and not in its path? Hsiao says: &#8220;Officers are trained to continue firing until a perceived threat is neutralized, which often results in multiple rounds being discharged in rapid succession&#8230; There is an unavoidable delay between perceiving a change in threat, deciding to stop shooting, and physically executing that decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the sketch of his view. You may have objections. Hsiao deals with some, so <a href="https://flyoverphilosophy.substack.com/p/why-the-minneapolis-ice-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go read the piece</a>. I don&#8217;t know enough about the law to know if Hsiao has it right, that is, whether he&#8217;s correct about the law he discusses and whether he hasn&#8217;t omitted other legal or evidentiary considerations that bear on the case but are more hostile to his conclusion. If you know about that, speak up in the comments.</p>
<p>After Renee Good was shot, ICE agents made no efforts to see to her medical needs. In fact they actively <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5678653-minnesota-ice-shooting-witness-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevented a doctor</a> at the scene from attending to Good. They reportedly left their vehicles unattended in a way that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/09/federal-officers-blocked-medics-from-scene-of-ice-shooting-witnesses-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked an ambulance</a>, further delaying medical care. Good still had a pulse when medical workers were eventually able to reach her, but she died shortly thereafter. These crucial moments after the supposed threat is neutralized are, as <a href="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/blum-stereotyping-vs-black-lives-matter.pdf">Lawrence Blum argued in a different context</a>, morally significant, as they suggest that it does not matter to these officers of the law whether the people they interact with live or die. Might they be legally significant, too, in regard to understanding the intent of the agents and assessing the veracity of their reports?</p>
<p>From the abundant footage coming out of Minneapolis, it seems that many ICE officers are overly aggressive and violent and that they regularly violate or disregard people&#8217;s rights. By many accounts their training has been rushed or poor.</p>
<p>ICE&#8217;s innocent victims have included <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000010631041/minneapolis-ice-shooting-video.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moms</a> trying to keep their neighborhoods safe, <a href="https://x.com/RealKevinNoel/status/2010619790722003412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teens</a> at work after school, <a href="https://x.com/noturtlesoup17/status/2011148947411407258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people</a> on their way to the doctor&#8217;s office. ICE agents <a href="https://x.com/TheJFreakinC/status/2011130471481065497" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop people on the street</a> and ask them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhB7g7LU0Wc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where they were born</a> and to prove they are citizens. They have been <a href="https://x.com/LongTimeHistory/status/2010495323345412419" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entering homes</a> without permission and without the <a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/administrative-warrants-home-entry/69986172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appropriate warrants</a>. They are often brutal in their tactics. They respond to people asserting their rights by dragging them from their cars and whisking them away in unmarked SUVs. <a href="https://x.com/Kaos_Vs_Control/status/1998546213688201345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protestors</a> are <a href="https://x.com/TheJFreakinC/status/2011436032051274168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physically</a> assaulted. People are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/el-paso-ice-detainee-homicide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being killed</a> while in ICE facilities.</p>
<p>In short, agents of the law have been terrorizing and killing people, including US citizens, and do not seem to evince any concern for the lives of the people they have harmed. That&#8217;s bad. If Hsiao is correct, then, from the point of view of the law, there is nothing wrong with that, in at least one well-known instance. That&#8217;s worse.</p>
<p>But if it&#8217;s correct, it would be good to know. Better to be clear-eyed about the system one is working in and the obstacles it poses than to form expectations on the false belief that the law and the authorities fundamentally conform to your moral sensibilities. Better to act and strategize in light of how things are than on the basis of mistaken expectations and wishful thinking.</p>
<p>That said, what would be most welcome are arguments to the effect that things in this case are as they seem to so many people, that is, that the killing of Renee Good was not legally justified.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1: </strong>While Minnesota is not the only place ICE is active, thousands of agents are in the Minneapolis area.
