<p>Pope Leo XIV, the first American to lead the Catholic Church, has left Italy for a six-day visit to Turkey and Lebanon, his first trip abroad since his election in May. He landed in Ankara on Thursday, where he will meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan before travelling on to the historic city of Nicaea (Iznik) to mark the 1,700th anniversary of the First Council of Nicaea, a foundational gathering for Christian doctrine. The journey will then take him to Lebanon, where he is scheduled to visit Bkerké, celebrate Mass at the Port of Beirut in memory of victims of the 2020 port explosion, and address a country grappling with political and economic crisis. Across both stops he is expected to deliver speeches in English that highlight peace in the Middle East, outreach to Muslim-majority societies, and closer ties among long-divided Christian churches, offering an early look at his diplomatic priorities.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eqgrrsmi89wMfDBsDAFRr2RHMutcH9sKoB-QPG7_0tua6xWTQZAlRrfaMgkq72CJZitrDNlq0Hvm09zw2xAs8Cw3Ysbah1Dc5-tobeWH2ab7jxDA7sZ5mekgUsMXzKag0flp2UGJOY2N0T5cnkAhwcRn7b1J946B2JlLdBIzeu5CyeqpkTx3XOb3X7QWGyl-ebsuJQ' alt='Pope Leo XIV departs Rome at the start of his six-day visit to Turkey and Lebanon.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ecumenical focus: In Iznik, on Lake Iznik in northwestern Turkey, Leo will join the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople for an ecumenical commemoration of the First Council of Nicaea, underlining his interest in healing rifts between Catholic and Orthodox churches.</li><li>Beirut remembrance: The pope’s Mass at Beirut’s port is specifically dedicated to honoring those killed in the 2020 explosion, linking his pastoral visit to Lebanon’s ongoing struggle with trauma and reconstruction.</li><li>Security planning: Vatican officials have indicated that dedicated security arrangements will be put in place in Lebanon, reflecting both the sensitivity of the visit and the country’s fragile stability.</li><li>Language of speeches: Leo is expected to deliver his major addresses on this trip in English, a choice that reflects both his American background and a desire to reach a broad regional and global audience directly.</li><li>Modern papal travel: Analysts note that international trips have become central to modern papacies, with Leo’s four-day schedule in Turkey and subsequent days in Lebanon seen as his first major opportunity to set out foreign-policy priorities after decades spent as a missionary in Peru and only recently as a Vatican official.</li></ul><blockquote>I have very much been looking forward to this trip because of what it means for Christians, but it is also a great message to the whole world. - Pope Leo XIV</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pope Leo XIV: Leo described the journey as a “historic moment” and said he hoped it would send a message that speaks both to Christians and to the wider world beyond the church.
