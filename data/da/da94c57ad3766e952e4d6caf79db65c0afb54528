<p>An episode from P.T. Barnum&#8217;s childhood in Bethel, Connecticut:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8216;What is the price of razor strops?&#8217; inquired my grandfather of a peddler, whose wagon, loaded with Yankee notions, stood in front of our store.</p>
<p>&#8216;A dollar each for Pomeroy&#8217;s strops,&#8217; responded the itinerant merchant.</p>
<p>&#8216;A dollar apiece!&#8217; exclaimed my grandfather; &#8216;they&#8217;ll be sold for half the money before the year is out.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;If one of Pomeroy&#8217;s strops is sold for fifty cents within a year, I&#8217;ll make you a present of one,&#8217; replied the peddler.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll purchase one on those conditions. Now, Ben, I call you to witness the contract,&#8217; said my grandfather, addressing himself to Esquire Hoyt.</p>
<p>&#8216;All right,&#8217; responded Ben.</p>
<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said the peddler, &#8216;I&#8217;ll do as I say, and there&#8217;s no backout to me.&#8217;</p>
<p>My grandfather took the strop, and put it in his side coat pocket.</p>
<p>Presently drawing it out, and turning to Esquire Hoyt, he said, &#8216;Ben, I don&#8217;t much like this strop now I have bought it. How much will you give for it?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Well, I guess, seeing it&#8217;s you, I&#8217;ll give fifty cents,&#8217; drawled the &#8216;Squire, with a wicked twinkle in his eye, which said that the strop and the peddler were both incontinently sold.</p>
<p>&#8216;You can take it. I guess I&#8217;ll get along with my old one a spell longer,&#8217; said my grandfather, giving the peddler a knowing look.</p>
<p>The strop changed hands, and the peddler exclaimed, &#8216;I acknowledge, gentlemen; what&#8217;s to pay?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Treat the company, and confess you are taken in, or else give me a strop,&#8217; replied my grandfather.</p>
<p>&#8216;I never will confess nor treat,&#8217; said the peddler, &#8216;but I&#8217;ll give you a strop for your wit;&#8217; and suiting the action to the word, he handed a second strop to his customer. A hearty laugh ensued, in which the peddler joined.</p>
<p>&#8216;Some pretty sharp fellows here in Bethel,&#8217; said a bystander, addressing the peddler.</p>
<p>&#8216;Tolerable, but nothing to brag of,&#8217; replied the peddler; &#8216;I have made seventy-five cents by the operation.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;How is that?&#8217; was the inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8216;I have received a dollar for two strops which cost me only twelve and a half cents each,&#8217; replied the peddler; &#8216;but having heard of the cute tricks of the Bethel chaps, I thought I would look out for them and fix my prices accordingly. I generally sell these strops at twenty-five cents each, but, gentlemen, if you want any more at fifty cents apiece, I shall be happy to supply your whole village.&#8217;</p>
<p>Our neighbors laughed out of the other side of their mouths, but no more strops were purchased.
