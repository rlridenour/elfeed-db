<p>Japan’s last two giant pandas, the four-year-old twins Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei at Tokyo’s Ueno Zoo, are set to return to China in the coming days, drawing large farewell crowds and tight viewing rules at the zoo. Their departure leaves Japan without any pandas for the first time since the early 1970s, underscoring how animal loans have long doubled as symbols of China-Japan goodwill. Several outlets tie the uncertain prospects of a new panda loan to currently strained bilateral relations, including heightened friction linked to Japan’s public comments on Taiwan and China’s pushback.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/REvTUVLjWuQAGrlnkkJ4vzHrXmkSgqVEiqOgUGTFydCS2BeSQzJtL9Jn4lvxozocIMn7KaBcsQn_8EquR0ff_ZycnUfG-lccxT6vjYkG0CBPlEneB2ymu2vCAWvU42Ltd8Ao4k4UZyUYHvkhkEWAcQJSNWy7vzp4l2CDGKAXJ_6Zhyxa9GA9heWNolxNy8KAeXyU7g' alt='Visitors gather at Tokyo’s Ueno Zoo ahead of the departure of panda twins Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Crowd send-off: Fans queued and jostled for brief final looks at the twins at Ueno Zoo, reflecting the pandas’ enduring popularity as goodwill symbols in Japan.</li><li>Panda diplomacy: The articles describe pandas as Chinese national symbols typically loaned abroad under arrangements where China retains ownership, using the animals as a form of soft-power outreach.</li><li>1972 milestone: China first sent pandas to Japan in 1972 following the normalization of bilateral ties, a history several sources cite to frame today’s farewell.</li><li>Ties and Taiwan: One account links the downturn in ties to remarks by Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi about possible Japanese military involvement if a Taiwan conflict threatened Japan, which China condemned.</li><li>Future uncertainty: Prospects for Japan to receive another panda pair appear unclear in the near term, with multiple reports pointing to the broader chill in China-Japan relations.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Panda fans and Tokyo residents: Many visitors treated the pandas as beloved local stars and turned out in large numbers for a farewell visit before the twins depart for China.
