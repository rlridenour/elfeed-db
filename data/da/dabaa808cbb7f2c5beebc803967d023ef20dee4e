<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 5 licenses ($19.99 value each) for <a href="https://liiift.app/">Liiift</a>. I don&rsquo;t lift much these days, but this app looks good enough to get me back into it. Liiift is a beautiful iOS app designed to help you get the most out of your weightlifting workouts. This giveaway is for lifetime licenses!</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Liiift is an iOS workout tracker and planner for weightlifting routines. It helps you stay focused in the gym with rest timer, and pushes you further with a power bar that compares your current progress to your typical lifts. Liiift packs power in a simple, offline-first, iOS-native design that feels right at home.</p>
