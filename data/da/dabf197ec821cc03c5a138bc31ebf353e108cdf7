<p>Emma Roth, The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TechCrunch has a new owner, again. Yahoo has sold the tech news
site to the private equity firm Regent for an undisclosed sum,
according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/techcrunch-has-personal-news/">an announcement on Friday</a>.</p>

<p>Regent is the same company that <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250320976126/en/IDC-Enters-a-New-Era-of-Growth-and-Innovation-Following-Foundry-Sale">snapped up Foundry</a>, the firm
behind outlets like PCWorld, Macworld, and TechAdvisor on
Thursday. Founded in 2005, TechCrunch has experienced many
shakeups in ownership <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/28/why-we-sold-techcrunch-to-aol-and-where-we-go-from-here/">after AOL acquired the site in 2010</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of shakeups in a lot of media companies’ ownership lately. Steady as she goes here at The Daring Fireball Company, a subsidiary of Fedora World Media Industries.</p>
