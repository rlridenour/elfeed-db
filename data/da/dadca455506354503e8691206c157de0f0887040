<p>Because it depends partly on the phase of the moon, the date of Easter Sunday can vary by as much as 35 days.</p>
<p>In 1928, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed an act that would establish its date as the Sunday following the second Saturday in April (and thus always falling between April 9 and 15).</p>
<p>Though passed and enacted, the act has never come into force because the British government agreed that the change would need to be made in consultation with church leaders. It&#8217;s known as the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/18-19/35">Easter Act 1928</a>.</p>
<p>(In the meantime, here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2011/05/16/rhyme-for-remembering-the-date-of-easter/">mnemonic</a> for remembering the current system.)</p>
