<p>A boiler exploded at a glue-making factory in or near Faisalabad in eastern Pakistan on Friday, flattening/destroying the factory building and damaging nearby homes. Officials reported at least 15 deaths and seven injured in early counts, with some outlets later citing 16 to 18 dead and up to 21 injured as rescue teams worked through the debris. A preliminary probe points to a gas leak as the likely trigger.
