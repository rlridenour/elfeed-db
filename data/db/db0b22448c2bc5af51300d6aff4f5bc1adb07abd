<p>I get the occasional ping to package the <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-org-block-company-completion">code from this post</a> and publish it <a href="https://melpa.org/#/company-org-block">on melpa</a>. Finally gave it a go. Moved the code <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/company-org-block">here</a>.</p>
<p>This was my first time publishing on melpa. The process was very <a href="https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/7593">smooth</a>. Big thanks to melpa volunteers!</p>
