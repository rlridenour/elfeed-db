Apple is planning to launch new MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips alongside macOS 26.3, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>

"Apple's faster MacBook Pros are planned for the macOS 26.3 release cycle," wrote Gurman, in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-01/apple-s-record-quarter-and-ai-changes-macbook-pro-update-clamshell-iphone-fold"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm told the new models — code-named J714 and J716 — are slated for the macOS 26.3 software cycle, which runs from February through March," he explained.<br/>
<br/>
macOS 26.3 remains in beta testing, but the update should be coming soon, with a wide release expected in February. Gurman was careful to also mention March, but this seems rather unlikely, unless the macOS 26.3 beta testing cycle drags on longer than expected, or the new MacBook Pro models are tied to macOS 26.3.1 or later.<br/>
<br/>
As of now, we expect the macOS 26.3 Release Candidate to be seeded in the first half of February, so a new MacBook Pro announcement could be just around the corner.<br/>
<br/>
In October, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/10/10/macos-tahoe-itself-has-leaked-2025-and-2026-mac-release-timelines"><em>AppleInsider</em>'s Marko Zivkovic was first to report</a> that MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips were "expected to ship with macOS 26.3," so this rumor has now been shared by multiple sources.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, no major changes are expected for these models.<br/>
<br/>
In late 2026 or in 2027, the MacBook Pro is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/25/macbook-pro-two-upgrades-in-2026-rumor/">expected to receive a major redesign</a>, with rumored features including an OLED display with touch capabilities, M6 Pro and M6 Max chips, a thinner design, and built-in cellular connectivity.<br/>
