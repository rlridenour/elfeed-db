<p>House Democrats publicly released emails tied to Jeffrey Epstein that have renewed scrutiny of President Trump after some messages mention Mr. Trump and a victim, according to the documents disclosed by the House Oversight Committee. The excerpts released by Democrats include lines in which Epstein suggested Mr. Trump &quot;knew about the girls&quot; and referenced time a victim spent at Mr. Trump&#x27;s home, prompting intensified calls for transparency in Congress. The disclosures have increased political pressure and led to a planned House vote on fuller public disclosure amid partisan fights inside the Republican conference.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/XfmErwCxPzGEc5Ojk_znjgtpr0d_r-cwS2KKLIFkk7LHWF4mboPOsjS3Sa40vjcWNLyOxR-tqMLdpurqcIR7NPCniJ-tjXDCt9im7hKttt1peelk0rww-r5Kj-95lqHu25VL6MOib8xlAH931zlszdGrVor32PVMJvhkyOuX3lkmrj8wNTe90TDhRR1v-JF9E-wpcmo3DBUjJfvy' alt='Documents from the House Oversight Committee among materials cited in recent disclosures' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Extent of contacts: The released records show Epstein corresponded regularly with executives, academics and political players long after his 2008 sex‑crime conviction, according to committee documents and reporting.</li><li>Damaging lines: In messages produced by Democrats, Epstein once wrote that &#x27;of course he knew about the girls,&#x27; and other notes suggest Mr. Trump &#x27;spent hours&#x27; with a victim, language highlighted in the selective releases.</li><li>Estate and releases: Reporting says the Epstein estate produced three specific email conversations that Democrats selectively released on Nov. 12, and that earlier Republican efforts to limit disclosure helped amplify the controversy.</li><li>Political ripple: Analysts and columnists say the episode has produced unusual political alignments—uniting some MAGA supporters and progressive critics around anti‑establishment resentment — shifting the debate from purely legal questions to broader political dynamics.</li></ul><blockquote>Of course he knew about the girls. - Jeffrey Epstein</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>House Democrats: Democrats said the documents reveal Epstein&#x27;s continued ties and argued the material merits full public disclosure to help congressional oversight and public understanding.
