<p>China has carried out its first emergency space launch, sending the uncrewed Shenzhou 22 spacecraft into orbit on a Long March 2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre on Tuesday to restore a safe ride home for three astronauts on the Tiangong space station. Shenzhou 22 was originally scheduled as a crewed mission in 2026 but was brought forward after the Shenzhou 20 return capsule was likely struck by space debris earlier in November, making it unsafe for re-entry and briefly leaving its crew without a working escape vehicle. The earlier Shenzhou 20 team eventually flew back to Earth aboard Shenzhou 21 on November 14, later than planned, which meant the newly arrived relief crew had no reliable return craft available. The new spacecraft has already docked with Tiangong, carries hundreds of kilograms of supplies and repair equipment, and is expected to serve as the return vehicle for the current crew sometime in 2026, while Chinese officials report the astronauts remain in good health and are working normally.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/TkFVKTnEVl5W-_ePqw-tYvMofoVsYSTDmkvwUuAhxnrpI9KkexJkdlRRM08iKIwjhnws2RDTto24WFySDLaCcvpHQPH_63ZIMLQHHqmAQvJ7' alt='A Long March 2F rocket on the launchpad ahead of a crewed Shenzhou mission from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Rapid docking: Shenzhou 22 reached Tiangong and docked in less than four hours after its midday liftoff, underscoring China’s growing ability to conduct fast-response missions in orbit.</li><li>Cargo and repair kit: The spacecraft delivered about 600 kilograms of cargo, including food and special equipment designed to fix or replace systems linked to the damaged return craft.</li><li>Crew currently aboard: The Tiangong station is presently staffed by astronauts Zhang Lu, Wu Fei and Zhang Hongzhang, who launched on Shenzhou 21 and now have Shenzhou 22 as their backup ride home.</li><li>Mission cadence: Recent Shenzhou flights have rotated three-person station crews roughly every six months, keeping Tiangong continuously inhabited as China develops long-duration spaceflight experience.</li><li>International partnerships: China, barred from the International Space Station since a 2011 US ban on NASA–China collaboration, has responded by building Tiangong and in February signed a deal with Pakistan to recruit the first foreign astronauts for its programme.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>China Manned Space Agency: The agency said before launch that the three Shenzhou 21 astronauts on Tiangong were &quot;working normally and in good condition,&quot; indicating confidence that station operations remained stable while the replacement spacecraft was prepared.
