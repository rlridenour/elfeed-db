<p>&#8220;I will be resigning after this semester from my tenured position at West Point after 13 years on the faculty. I cannot tolerate these changes, which prevent me from doing my job responsibly. I am ashamed to be associated with the academy in its current form.&#8221;<span id="more-53790"></span></p>

<p>That is <a href="https://philpeople.org/profiles/graham-parsons-1?app=6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graham Parsons</a>, whose individual webpage has already been taken down by West Point, announcing his resignation in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/west-point-trump-military.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The New York Times</em></a> today.</p>
<p>The changes he is referring to are those demanded by Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-americas-fighting-force/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive order</a> and a <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jan/29/2003634987/-1/-1/1/RESTORING-AMERICAS-FIGHTING-FORCE.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memo</a> concerning prohibitions on what faculty may teach at United States military educational institutions, and put into place by West Point&#8217;s administration, which he says has interpreted them broadly. The result: &#8220;a sweeping assault on the school’s curriculum and the faculty members’ research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Parsons writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>In a matter of days, the United States Military Academy at West Point abandoned its core principles. Once a school that strove to give cadets the broad-based, critical-minded, nonpartisan education they need for careers as Army officers, it was suddenly eliminating courses, modifying syllabuses and censoring arguments to comport with the ideological tastes of the Trump administration&#8230;</em></p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Mr. Trump’s order prohibited any educational institution operated by the armed forces from “promoting, advancing or otherwise inculcating” certain “un-American” theories, including “gender ideology” and the idea that “America’s founding documents are racist or sexist.”</em></p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Mr. Hegseth’s memo went further, adding that the service academies were prohibited even from providing instruction about such topics. Mr. Trump and Mr. Hegseth also ordered that the academies shall “teach that America and its founding documents remain the most powerful force for good in human history.”</em></p>
<p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>These were brazen demands to indoctrinate, not educate.</em></p>
<p>There were also restrictions on faculty writing implemented by the West Point administration:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Neither Mr. Trump’s order nor Mr. Hegseth’s memo mentioned faculty research. Nevertheless, on Feb. 13, the dean’s office shared a memo outlining a policy requiring faculty members to get approval from their department heads to do any writing, talks, social media posting or other public expressions of our scholarship if it is affiliated with West Point. I am writing this essay without having secured approval.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Though the memo does not say so, administrators have told me that any parts of my research that seem to conflict with the Trump administration’s politics will not be approved. Many faculty members, including me (I study, among other things, masculinity and war), can no longer publish or promote our scholarship.</em></p>
<p>More details are in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/west-point-trump-military.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full piece</a>, which is worth reading.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><i>A West Point philosophy course, required of all the academy’s sophomores, until recently included a lesson on Immanuel Kant, a key figure in Western enlightenment philosophy. The lesson noted that Kant was also a proponent of racial hierarchies, and it encouraged cadets to wrestle with the contradiction.</i></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>West Point administrators decided in early February that the lesson violated Mr. Hegseth’s order.</em></p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/05/08/west-point-philosophy-professor-resigns-after-trumps-incursions-on-academic-freedom/">West Point Philosophy Professor Resigns After Trump’s Incursions on Academic Freedom (updated)</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
