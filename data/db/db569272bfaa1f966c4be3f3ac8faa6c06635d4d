Mac users can download the new software by opening up the System Settings app and navigating to the Software Update section.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's release notes, &zwnj;macOS Tahoe&zwnj; 26.3 focuses on bug fixes and security updates rather than new features, so it is a smaller update than some of the other releases we've had.<br/>
<br/>
In the next couple of weeks, Apple will begin testing &zwnj;macOS Tahoe&zwnj; 26.4, an update that is expected to be much more feature packed. &zwnj;macOS Tahoe&zwnj; 26.4 could include new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> functionality and new emoji, among other features.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS Tahoe</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-tahoe.250">macOS Tahoe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/apple-releases-macos-tahoe-26-3/">Apple Releases macOS Tahoe 26.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-macos-tahoe-26-3.2477549/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
