  <p>Earlier this year, Chinese authorities refused to allow one of
Apple’s Chinese equipment suppliers to export machinery to India
that Apple needed for the upcoming iPhone 17’s trial production,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. So
the supplier got creative.</p>

<p>It set up a front company in Southeast Asia to buy the machines.
Once the equipment reached the Southeast Asian country, it went to
a factory in India operated by Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that
builds most of Apple’s iPhones in China, the people said.</p>

<p>Ian Malcolm: “Life finds a way.” So too with Apple getting what it wants.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>India is already assembling between 30 million and 40 million
iPhones a year — as much as one-fifth of the iPhone’s global
production, according to people involved in Apple’s India supply
chain. Apple is planning to increase iPhone production in India by
around 10% this year, one of those people said. The company has a
long-term goal of moving about half of its iPhone production out
of China, according to other people involved in Apple’s supply
chain. [...]</p>

<p>Increasingly, though, just getting that manufacturing equipment to
India is a hassle. In many cases, Chinese authorities are delaying
or blocking shipments of iPhone equipment to India without
explanation, according to multiple people involved in iPhone
production.</p>

<p>Foxconn has seen approval times from Chinese authorities for
exporting iPhone-making equipment from its China factories to
those in India rise from two weeks to as long as four months, one
of the people said. They are also rejecting some export
applications without explanation, the person added.</p>

<p>The equipment Chinese authorities are scrutinizing includes
high-precision lasers that weld metal parts to the frames of
iPhones, air leak test stations that measure how waterproof the
devices are, and machines that can identify, grab and move parts
from one location to another, known as pick-and-place machines,
according to three people involved in iPhone manufacturing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hardball tactics on all sides here.</p>
