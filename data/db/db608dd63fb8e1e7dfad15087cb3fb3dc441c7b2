<p>In the latest development, the United States says the Gaza ceasefire framework Israel and Hamas have been following since October has moved into a second phase that shifts the focus from sustaining the truce to Gaza’s demilitarisation, governance arrangements, and reconstruction. US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said phase two is part of President Trump’s 20-point plan and includes steps toward setting up a Palestinian technocratic administration for day-to-day management of Gaza. While the transition offers a pathway toward more stable civilian governance and rebuilding, multiple outlets report that the core obstacles remain: reaching agreement on Hamas disarmament and implementing further Israeli withdrawal provisions without the truce breaking down.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Z6RtsORpjgSnDILKSLUcKNQKXddvCP_nZ1YTfJs-fHTILkGkaMjfeNz5ruUWomuL_V6UMfYF2jTbtLFtQa_qUto1sqovGoreizMMFCa2flTAry2mZN_ftk11mpyEWWkEeWMFt-4GhhvlTyCaitpNtJ_pvPcHp7GKM0BPedIcUJBr7rjfSQiaSFaKKKQAnJEqjDkY-CSJdxVGSohzYikxmJaN3Edu2S-cRNWJ3hyEJRzvGb5UaOucPuPaH789UgsIJTKD4gRhbJ1rkoEH-w' alt='Palestinians inspect damage after part of a war-damaged building collapsed in Gaza City.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Hostage exchange: Under the deal’s first phase, Hamas released all but one hostage it was holding in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, a step cited as a key confidence-building outcome.</li><li>Gaza governance: Egypt announced the formation of a 15-person Palestinian technocratic committee intended to administer post-war Gaza, aligning with plans for a panel of technocrats described by US and regional mediators.</li><li>US warning: Witkoff said the US expects Hamas to meet obligations that include the “immediate return of the final deceased hostage,” warning of “serious consequences” if it does not.</li><li>Aid surge context: Phase one included a partial Israeli withdrawal and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which several reports note helped underpin the October truce.</li><li>Supervision plan: PBS reports the second phase envisions Gaza’s day-to-day affairs being run by Palestinian experts “under American supervision,” a structure likely to shape how services and reconstruction are managed.</li></ul><blockquote>We are announcing the launch of phase two of the president’s 20-Point plan to End the Gaza conflict, moving from ceasefire to demilitarisation, technocratic governance, and reconstruction - Steve Witkoff</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House / US government: US officials say phase two has begun and centers on demilitarising Gaza alongside political and rebuilding steps, while acknowledging substantial hurdles ahead.
