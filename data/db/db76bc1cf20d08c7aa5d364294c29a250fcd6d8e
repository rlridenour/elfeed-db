<p>If you’ve been using Macs for any length of time, you’ve probably tried every file organization system imaginable. Color-coded folders, elaborate naming conventions, quarterly “clean-up days” that never quite stick. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The truth is, most of us have given up. Your Desktop is covered in screenshots. Your Downloads folder is a mess. And your Documents folder? Full of files you haven’t touched in years.</p>

<h2>Enter Sparkle: AI-Powered Organization</h2>
<p>Sparkle takes a radically different approach to file organization. Instead of requiring you to change your habits (good luck with that), it works with how you already use your Mac. Drop a file on your Desktop? Sparkle quietly organizes it. Download something for a project? Sparkle knows where it should go.</p>
<p>Here’s what makes it special:</p>
<p><strong>The Three-Folder System</strong></p>
<p>Sparkle automatically sorts your files into three intelligent categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recents</strong>: Files from the last three days stay easily accessible  </li>
<li><strong>AI Library</strong>: Older files get automatically organized into a smart folder structure that Sparkle creates based on YOUR specific files  </li>
<li><strong>Manual Library</strong>: For those folders you want to organize yourself (we get it, some things are sacred)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It Actually Understands Your Files</strong></p>
<p>Sparkle looks at your filenames and creates a folder structure that makes sense for YOU. Tax documents go with tax documents. Project files cluster together. Screenshots find their proper home. It’s like having a very patient assistant who actually understands how your brain works.</p>
<h2>Privacy-First Approach</h2>
<p>Before you ask (because I know you’re thinking it): Sparkle only sends filenames to process organization—never file contents. Filenames are temporarily stored for performance optimization and deleted after 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Built-In Duplicate Finder</strong></p>
<p>Sparkle’s built-in Duplicate Finder deserves special mention. It scans your entire folder structure—including deeply nested folders and external drives—to instantly identify identical files. With one click, you can clean up these duplicates and reclaim valuable disk space. For anyone who’s accidentally saved the same file multiple times or has collections of “Screenshot (1)” through “Screenshot (47)”, you know how much space these duplicates waste.</p>
<h2>What Makes Sparkle Different</h2>
<p>Sparkle solves a real problem without requiring behavioral change. Sparkle’s not going to suddenly make you an organized person. But your Mac can be organized anyway.</p>
<p>Sparkle works with any folder on your Mac, including external drives and cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, Box). Once you set it up, it runs quietly in your menu bar, doing its thing while you do yours.</p>
