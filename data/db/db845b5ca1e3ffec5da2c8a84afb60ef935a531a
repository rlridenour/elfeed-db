<p>Spanish authorities are investigating a deadly high-speed rail collision near Córdoba in southern Spain after one train derailed and ended up in the path of an oncoming service on Sunday evening. By Monday, officials reported at least 39 people killed and more than 120 injured, making it Spain’s worst rail accident in more than a decade. Services between Madrid and parts of Andalusia were suspended, and at least one report said the southern high-speed network faced wider closures as authorities worked at the scene and began safety checks.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/4DvGCPOp320QchMNWy0A-fkQGpcLoC5qUrO7tbm13MY0mT6brAegaPSKQcDxI4mjWEJNj6t5xlb8zAjYI3ydqunBeuT-yuOHaU6mns6Bic91uCfGtq51shwZ64ePwxqLQHkICaJJzFMqiUgR-Ey0BXhixmcLrfN_kOoM7dW8RDyrcvxTClM0eWqaeVoAT3UeMv6-MINo1ItZvU1YXlG0JiX40WcP5tpsnd6w3zMPEN35_nSeqB9-IqrU48bGg5WKOIFSQXhoTuXQX5pkew' alt='People affected by the derailment are transferred and treated at the Caseta Municipal in Adamuz after the collision near Córdoba (Jan. 18, 2026).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who was onboard: Rail operator Adif said the Málaga-to-Madrid train carried about 300 passengers and the other service had roughly 200 onboard, underscoring the scale of the emergency response.</li><li>Where it happened: The crash occurred near the municipality of Adamuz in Córdoba province at about 7:45 p.m. local time, according to Adif and multiple reports.</li><li>Injuries and care: Emergency services in Andalusia said 122 people received treatment, with 48 still hospitalized and 12 in intensive care as of Monday morning.</li><li>Investigation underway: Spain’s Railway Accident Investigation Commission opened an investigation, with officials saying the cause of the derailment was not immediately clear.</li><li>Why it puzzled: Transport Minister Óscar Puente said the derailment happened on a straight, recently renovated stretch of track and described the incident as “extremely strange”.</li></ul><blockquote>A night of deep pain for our country - Pedro Sánchez</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Spanish transport minister Óscar Puente: He said the crash was hard to explain at this stage because it occurred on a straight, renovated section of track and involved a train that was “practically new,” while warning the death toll might still rise.
