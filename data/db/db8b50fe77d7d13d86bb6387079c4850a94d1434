<p id="p1">Apple released a statement to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Gruber of Daring Fireball</a> today announcing that it is delaying a &ldquo;more personalized Siri.&rdquo; According to Apple&rsquo;s Jacqueline Roy:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote2"><p>
  Siri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we&rsquo;ve made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT. We&rsquo;ve also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It&rsquo;s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p3">This isn&rsquo;t surprising given where things stand with Siri and Apple Intelligence more generally, but it is still disappointing. Of all the features shown off at WWDC last year, the ability to have Siri take actions in multiple apps on your behalf through natural language requests was one of the most eagerly anticipated. But, I&rsquo;d prefer to get a feature that works than one that is half-baked.</p>
<p id="p4">Still, you have to wonder where the rest of the AI market will be by the time  a &ldquo;more personalized Siri&rdquo; is released and whether it will look as much like yesterday&rsquo;s tech as some of today&rsquo;s Apple Intelligence features do.</p>
