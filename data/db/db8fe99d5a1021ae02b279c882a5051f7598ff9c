<p>He stood on his head by the wild seashore,<br />
And danced on his hands a jig;<br />
In all his emotions, as never before,<br />
A wildly hilarious grig.</p>
<p>And why? In that ship just crossing the bay<br />
His mother-in-law had sailed<br />
For a tropical country far away,<br />
Where tigers and fever prevailed.</p>
<p>Oh, now he might hope for a peaceful life<br />
And even be happy yet,<br />
Though owning no end of neuralgic wife,<br />
And up to his collar in debt.</p>
<p>He had borne the old lady through thick and thin,<br />
And she lectured him out of breath;<br />
And now as he looked at the ship she was in<br />
He howled for her violent death.</p>
<p>He watched as the good ship cut the sea,<br />
And bumpishly up-and-downed,<br />
And thought if already she qualmish might be,<br />
He&#8217;d consider his happiness crowned.</p>
<p>He watched till beneath the horizon&#8217;s edge<br />
The ship was passing from view;<br />
And he sprang to the top of a rocky ledge<br />
And pranced like a kangaroo.</p>
<p>He watched till the vessel became a speck<br />
That was lost in the wandering sea;<br />
And then, at the risk of breaking his neck,<br />
Turned somersaults home to tea.</p>
