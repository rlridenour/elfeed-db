<p>Eli Tan and Mike Isaac, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Monday, WhatsApp said it would start showing ads inside its app
for the first time. The promotions will appear only in an area of
the app called Updates, which is used by around 1.5 billion people
a day. WhatsApp will collect some data on users to target the ads,
such as location and the device’s default language, but it will
not touch the contents of messages or whom users speak with. The
company added that it had no plans to place ads in chats and
personal messages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(a) I’ve never once looked at the Updates tab in WhatsApp; (b) does <em>anyone</em> believe they’re <em>not</em> going to put ads in the other tabs sooner or later?</p>
