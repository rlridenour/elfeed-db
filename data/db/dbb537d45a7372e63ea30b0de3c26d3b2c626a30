<p><a href="https://flathabits.com/">Flat Habits</a> 1.1 is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1558358855">App Store</a>. Flat Habits is a habit tracker that’s mindful of your time, data, and privacy. It's powered by <a href="https://orgmode.org">org</a> plain text markup, enabling you to use your <a href="https://xenodium.com/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/">favorite editor</a> (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.) to poke at your habit data.</p>

<h2>Historical management</h2>
<p>Sometimes you forget to mark a habit done or make a mistake toggling one. Either way, you can now toggle any habit day from the calendar/streak view.</p>
<h3>Long tap</h3>
<p>Long tap shows you the editing option available for that day.</p>

<h2>Where's today?</h2>
<p>A few folks rightfully asked for today's date to be highlighted in the calendar view, and so we now have a red circle.</p>
