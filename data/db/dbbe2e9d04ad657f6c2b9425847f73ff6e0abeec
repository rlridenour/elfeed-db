<p>The demise of CRMEP is part of the university&#8217;s plan to shutter the entire <a href="https://www.kingston.ac.uk/faculties/kingston-school-of-art/study/humanities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humanities Department</a>, which would affect English Literature and Modern Languages programs as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/kingston-axes-philosophy-centre-humanities-department-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Times Higher Ed</em></a> provides some background:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Originally started at Middlesex University in 1995, the unit moved across London in 2010 when it was threatened with closure and is still seen, in many philosophers’ eyes, as an important centre for the study of European philosophy. Dozens of leading philosophers including Jürgen Habermas, Judith Butler and Slavoj Zizek signed a protest letter in February 2024 after Kingston announced that it was suspending PhD admissions, describing the centre as “one of the most valuable and distinctive centres of philosophical research anywhere in the English-speaking world”. The cuts follows Kingston’s closure of history and politics degrees in 2021, while philosophy has been under threat since a portfolio review was announced last year.</em></div>
<p>The faculty and staff union at Kingston has <a href="https://kingston.web.ucu.org.uk/2025/02/27/email-response-to-slt-consultation-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">objected</a> to the &#8220;barrage of closures to courses and entire departments&#8221; and &#8220;emails to numerous members inviting them to “consultations” regarding the future of their employment,&#8221; arguing in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FR8SBodsl61P0xPc8GYAg-EawymtjqPz/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a> that the process has been &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">unlawful and unreasonable&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/notes/658933/open-letter-from-crmep-students-researchers-on-kingston-university-s-proposed-closure-of-the-department-of-humanities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open letter</a>, students and researchers at CRMEP say that they &#8220;unequivocally condemn&#8221; the proposal to close the center, writing that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>CRMEP has forged a distinct space for itself within UK higher education. Committed to a politically and socially engaged philosophy, one that probes the outer edges of the discipline in its relation to arts, sciences, and the wider humanities, it is one of a handful of institutions that offers an alternative to the analytic style predominant in most philosophy departments.  </em></p>
