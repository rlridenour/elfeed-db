You&rsquo;ve all heard me moan many times about my failure to bring my last remaining significant application—Web browsing—into Emacs. There <i>are</i> some solutions but none of them come close to being sufficient. If you want full featured browsing, you&rsquo;re mostly restricted to Safari, Firefox, one of the niche browsers, or the privacy violating Chrome and whatever Microsoft&rsquo;s browser de jour is called.

Still, there is EWW, which some people find some sufficient for a subset of browsing tasks. Charles Choi is one of those people so naturally he&rsquo;s made using EWW easier by adding <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/announcing-casual-eww.html">Casual EWW</a> to his Casual Suite.

You can read his announcement for the details but, as usual, it&rsquo;s mainly a set of transient menus that make discovery and remembering obscure commands easier. As I&rsquo;ve said before, even if you need only some of the apps, it&rsquo;s worthwhile installing the Casual Suite.</p>
