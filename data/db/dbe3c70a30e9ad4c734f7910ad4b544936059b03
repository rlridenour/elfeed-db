<p>Tanzanian electoral authorities declared incumbent President Samia Suluhu Hassan the winner of Saturday’s vote with nearly 98% of the tally, after the two main opposition figures were excluded from the presidential ballot . The result touched off nationwide demonstrations that security forces moved to disperse; opposition leaders and a security source say hundreds have been killed, while the United Nations and other monitors reported lower confirmed death counts and called for investigations . International observers and members of the European Parliament questioned the integrity of the poll after arrests and bans on opposition participation, and the U.N. urged restraint and an independent probe into the violence .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/sexrCV-J_9AUVIK1tbdxfJF4MWR79x0YNpm_9xmuZiL4T0wf3Vk96iv_ld_ROEWBekc35WfsCdjpkzpRFF4uiM1wWcueg_QZsivGFlsK85XHLgp5zK3zYcPGVm4E1OxGGoLoTtZFBb9esZx6WyL97IE5Yde_--nmoEgyfZIRWUAAH4SG9Naemo7z5AAt5u1rPA' alt='President Samia Suluhu Hassan was declared the winner of an election that has set off violent protests and reports of electoral irregularities.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Opposition exclusion: Two major opposition parties and key rivals were jailed or barred from running, a factor that opponents say prompted mass protests</li><li>Communications blackout: Reports said an internet blackout affected parts of the country during unrest, complicating independent verification and communications</li><li>Rapid transition plans: State television and officials signalled a quick swearing-in ceremony for the declared winner, with state media reporting a ceremony to follow the result announcement</li><li>European scrutiny: Members of the European Parliament and external election monitors publicly questioned the vote’s credibility and called for clarity on the disqualifications</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Tanzania electoral commission / state media: The commission announced the official result on state television, declaring Samia Suluhu Hassan the winner with nearly all votes counted.
