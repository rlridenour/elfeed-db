<p>If you&rsquo;ve been using Emacs on macOS and iOS for a while, you probably know <a href="https://xenodium.com">Álvaro Ramírez</a>, the maker of <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-for-ios">Journelly</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command">dwim-shell-command</a>. I&rsquo;m a <a href="https://taonaw.com/archive/?q=journelly">fan</a> of <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/06/07/compressing-mp-files-while-keeping.html">both</a>.</p>
