<p>Cambodia has extradited three Chinese nationals, including Prince Group founder Chen Zhi, to China following a joint investigation into transnational fraud networks tied to large online scam operations in Southeast Asia. Authorities and prosecutors in the United States allege Chen helped mastermind a multinational cyber-fraud and money-laundering operation that targeted victims around the world. In a parallel step aimed at protecting the financial system, Cambodia’s central bank ordered the liquidation of Prince Bank, a lender founded by Chen, and suspended it from taking new deposits and providing new banking services.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/vTQTBSDIyb76NxajlV7r_D0xi1AOADw0j6G8mZogARIx5hAXzCw_OYNXs8_ZHC-vZ4EFgtyg2KNaPglraBxNM1o190y_yKaZuaR0h86eDVYjPu5koze82E_6JKmgK5t3jLLGaWN2zHq4Be0Ry9WOBXdFwVsxkJ_9LZFxt3V7OWZcBcW0ggMm' alt='Image published alongside reporting on Cambodia’s extradition of Chen Zhi.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>US indictment: U.S. prosecutors charged Chen in October with conspiracy allegations connected to a multinational cyber fraud network.</li><li>Forced-labour claims: US prosecutors allege scam operations involved compounds in Cambodia where trafficked workers were held under coercive conditions.</li><li>Bank shutdown: Cambodia’s central bank said Prince Bank was placed into liquidation under Cambodian law and halted from offering new services, including deposit-taking.</li><li>China allegations: Chinese authorities accuse Chen of operating a transnational criminal network from Cambodia that included casino-related activity and fraud, according to reports cited by the South China Morning Post.</li><li>Global victim focus: BBC reported the alleged fraud hubs were linked to scams that stole money from people in multiple countries, underscoring the cross-border reach of the networks.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Cambodian government: Officials said the extraditions followed a joint investigation into transnational fraud networks linked to large online scam operations in Southeast Asia.
