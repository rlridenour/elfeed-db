<p>In 2000, three sisters from Inverness bought a £1 million insurance policy to cover the cost of bringing up the infant Jesus Christ if one of them had a virgin birth.</p>
<p>Simon Burgess, managing director of britishinsurance.com, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/highlands_and_islands/5105946.stm">told the BBC</a>, &#8220;The people were concerned about having sufficient funds if they immaculately conceived. It was for caring and bringing up the Christ. We sometimes get weird requests and this is the weirdest we have had.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company withdrew the policy in 2006 after objections by the Catholic Church. &#8220;The burden of proof that it was Christ had rested with the women and any premium on the insurance was donated to charity, said Mr Burgess.&#8221;</p>
