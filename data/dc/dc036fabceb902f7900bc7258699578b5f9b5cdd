This is one of those posts to remind me of a solution to a rarely occurring problem.
</p>

 <p>
Emacs has a feature called  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Interlocking.html#:~:text=Emacs%20removes%20the%20lock%20when,benefits%20that%20this%20feature%20provides.">interlocking</a> to prevent two different users from modifying the same file. If, like me, you regularly use two different machines, this may occasionally present a problem. Most of the time, Emacs behaves nicely and gives the user some options to either steal the lock, proceed with the edit, or quit. Recently, though, I had a file that I needed to edit that Emacs simply wouldn’t let me open. Every time I tried, I just got this warning:  <code>Unlocking file: Invalid argument</code>. I suspect this might have had something to do with a system crash that prevented Emacs from saving the file and clearing its locked status. Eventually, I stumbled on a solution: delete the lockfile, which is a file in the directory that contains a “#” in the filename.
