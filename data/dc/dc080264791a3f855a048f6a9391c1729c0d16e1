<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that his powerful chief of staff and lead peace negotiator, Andriy Yermak, has resigned after Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies raided his residence and office as part of a sweeping probe into alleged kickbacks in the energy sector in Kyiv. Yermak, widely described as the second‑most‑influential figure in Ukraine and a central architect of Zelensky’s wartime decision‑making, had recently been appointed to lead high‑stakes talks with the United States on President Trump’s proposed plan to end Russia’s war on Ukraine. Investigators from the National Anti‑Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the Specialized Anti‑Corruption Prosecutor’s Office searched his apartment as part of an investigation into a roughly $100 million kickback scheme in the energy sector that has already led to the resignations of two government ministers and implicated a longtime Zelensky associate, though Yermak has not been charged. Zelensky said the presidential administration will be reorganized and promised quick consultations on a new chief of staff, while urging Ukrainians to ignore rumors and stressing that state institutions must stay focused on defending the country and preparing for further negotiations with Washington amid ongoing Russian military pressure.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/OKBckNmVXr7is0caberOBAxHPz8ANna78e9KcO_fH71YijMtv4RPvDjGmDluDRWLcootivH9HaUcgNjS9D7ELzjwpjKckyEJivRbS7DJbM8H' alt='Andriy Yermak, then head of Ukraine’s presidential office, speaking at a news conference in Washington earlier in 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Anti-graft agencies: Ukraine’s Western‑backed National Anti‑Corruption Bureau and Specialized Anti‑Corruption Prosecutor’s Office coordinated the raids on Yermak’s apartment, part of a broader push that has already produced multiple arrests linked to energy‑sector embezzlement.</li><li>Energy scheme details: The alleged kickback network centers on about $100 million siphoned from Ukraine’s strategic energy sector and has been linked by investigators to businessman Timur Mindich, a longtime business partner of Zelensky who prosecutors say has since fled the country.</li><li>Opposition demands: Ukrainian opposition politicians are seizing on Yermak’s removal to renew calls for a national unity government and a less centralized style of rule in Kyiv.</li><li>Kremlin messaging: The Kremlin said Yermak’s resignation shows that Kyiv is in a deep political crisis, using the shake‑up to question Ukraine’s internal stability while the war continues.</li><li>Yermak’s next step: After stepping down, Yermak publicly vowed to join the armed forces, insisting he is an honest person and saying he does not want to cause further problems for Zelensky.</li></ul><blockquote>Letting him go gives a second chance for the President to reset everything. - Unnamed senior Ukrainian official quoted about Andriy Yermak</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Volodymyr Zelensky: Zelensky thanked Yermak for his service, emphasized that Yermak had represented Ukraine’s negotiating position patriotically in talks with the United States, and urged citizens not to pay attention to rumors surrounding the resignation while promising to quickly consult on a replacement..
