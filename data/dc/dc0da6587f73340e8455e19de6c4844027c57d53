<p>I often quote snippets of Common Lisp in my blog.  I thought it'd be cool if I could colorize them,
  so I generated this app that takes Common Lisp and outputs a syntax colored version in standalone HTML suitable
  for pasting into a blog.  The output HTML has a ton of &lt;span&gt; tags that apply a color style to the text.  No stylesheet
  is necessary.</p>
