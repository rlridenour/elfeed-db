<li>Is it available in Georgia Red: No, that would be a bit over the top for a deadbolt</li>
</ul><h1>Click</h1><p>Okay, here are 4 reasons to buy this deadbolt.</p>
<p><strong>1. Fingerprint scanners are cool.</strong></p>
<p>Probably the least important reason, but of the key-less ways to unlock something, the fingerprint <em>feels</em> the coolest.</p>
<p>Like, seriously, facial recognition on your phone? It’s way more impressive, technologically speaking. But the novelty wears off within the first week of your first facially-unlocking phone. After that, it takes more than three seconds to work, and you’re like, “What, you don’t recognize me, you stupid piece of shit? Pathetic.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a fingerprint scan never ceases to make you feel like James Bond.</p>
<p><strong>2. You can set it on a timer.</strong></p>
<p>You ever lie down to sleep, start to nod off, and then suddenly think: <em>Wait, did I lock the door?</em> I know I have once or twice… a night.</p>
<p>It quickly becomes an impossible equation.</p>
<p>If you get up, you risk starting from square one in terms of drifting off to dreamland. And anyway, you locked it. Probably. But if you didn’t? That’s a yikes. And even if you leave it open and nothing happens, it’s going to just make the urge to check the door even stronger the next night.</p>
<p>But with this thing, you can set it on a schedule. So that it automatically locks at a certain time. Thus, knowing whether the door is locked is as simple as checking the time.</p>
<p><strong>3. You can control it from anywhere.</strong></p>
<p>“Hey, I happen to be in the neighborhood,” the plumber says, “so I can take a look at that busted hot water heater now, if you’re around.”</p>
<p>What an amazing stroke of luck, getting such a crucial piece of work done earlier than expected!</p>
<p>Only problem: you’re actually not around.</p>
<p>You’re at work. Or you’re a mile away from home on a long dog walk. Or at the grocery store. Or in a hotel room a little ways out of town, because that’s how desperate you are for a hot shower.</p>
<p>With this thing, you can unlock the door via the app so they can get in and then head that way yourself rather than try and convince them to wait 40 minutes for you to finish up whatever you’re doing and haul ass home.</p>
<p>(You can also use it with Alexa or Hey Google, but only if you opt for the Wi-Fi Hub.)</p>
<p><strong>4. You can always use a totally basic key.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re slow to adapt to tech, or you’ve got a cat sitter coming while on vacation who’s a little sporadic with timing their visits (so you can’t set those above-mentioned timers), you always have a couple keys to use.</p>
<p>Sure, you could say that about any basic old deadlock, but we wanted to point it out, since some tech products neglect the easy analog override option.</p>
<p>See, 4 good reasons.</p>
<p>Buy a deadbolt, please.</p>
