<p>The joists in the tower in which Montaigne wrote his <em>Essays</em> are inscribed with his favorite quotations from Greek and Latin authors, many of which appear in his writings: &#8220;It is not so much things that torment man, as the opinions he has of things.&#8221; &#8220;Every reasoning has its contrary.&#8221; &#8220;Wind swells bladders, opinion swells men.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wrote, &#8220;The room pleases me because it is somewhat difficult of access, and retired, as much on account of the utility of the exercise, as because I there avoid the crowd. Here is my seat, my place, my rest. I try to make it purely my own, and to free this single corner from conjugal, filial, and civil community.&#8221;</p>

<p>In large Latin letters on the central rafter are the words &#8220;I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. I PAUSE. I EXAMINE.&#8221;</p>
