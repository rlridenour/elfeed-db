Since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/15/apple-watch-se-series-6-family-setup/">watchOS 7 in 2020</a>, parents have been able to pair their iPhone to their child's Apple Watch. Formerly known as Apple Watch Family Setup, and now marketed as <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-for-your-kids/">Apple Watch For Your Kids</a>, this option allows kids to use an Apple Watch with a cellular plan for texting, calling, and location sharing, even if they do not own an iPhone.<br/>

For children, a cellular Apple Watch can be a stepping stone towards an iPhone, and Apple has now marketed that idea in a series of new ads.<br/>
<br/>
On its YouTube channel in Canada, Apple has shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYHxcbocHAE">three</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAaz1jcwWgs">short</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X1NqZAOkBo">videos</a> advertising the benefits of the Apple Watch For Your Kids feature. In each video, a child uses their cellular Apple Watch to text their parents. And in one of the videos, a parent reminds their child who is secretly at a shopping mall that they can see their child's location.<br/>

Three key benefits of a cellular Apple Watch for kids: texting, calling, and location sharing.<br/>

"Apple Watch with cellular lets your kids text, call and location share, all without their own phone," says each video's description.<br/>

Apple Watch For Your Kids requires a child to have an Apple Watch Series 4 or newer with watchOS 7 and later, while the parent must have an iPhone XS or later. A cellular Apple Watch is recommended for full functionality, but a limited set of features are available on Apple Watch models with Wi-Fi only.<br/>
