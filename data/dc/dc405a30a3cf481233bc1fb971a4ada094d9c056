<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects Apple to release new AirPods Pro this year, and he said the earbuds will have a key new feature: heart rate monitoring.<br/>

From his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-24/apple-to-launch-iphone-17-pro-iphone-17-air-in-september-iphone-fold-next-year-mepmzpcj"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, with emphasis added:<blockquote>As for Apple's other devices, there's a lot <strong>in the fall pipeline</strong> — though many of the new products are only incremental upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
There will be Apple Watch updates, faster Vision Pro headsets and iPad Pros with the M5 processor. You should <strong>also expect new AirPods Pro earbuds</strong> (I reported earlier this year that Apple is working on a pair with heart-rate monitoring), as well as HomePod minis and Apple TV set-top boxes.</blockquote>Apple already introduced a heart rate monitoring feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/powerbeats-pro-2-announced/">on the Powerbeats Pro 2</a> earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
When both Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds are placed in the ears, and heart rate monitoring is active, Apple says LED optical sensors pulse at over 100 times per second to measure heart rate via blood flow. The feature integrates with popular fitness apps to collect data during workouts and sync it to Apple's Health app on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
The feature is based on the Apple Watch's heart rate sensing technology. If someone is wearing both Powerbeats Pro 2 and an Apple Watch, Apple says apps default to using Apple Watch heart rate data, and that will likely be the case for the new AirPods Pro too.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond heart rate monitoring, it is likely that the next AirPods Pro will feature improved sound quality, increased active noise cancellation, design changes, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The current AirPods Pro 2 launched in September 2022, and they were updated with a USB-C charging case and a few other tweaks in September 2023.<br/>
