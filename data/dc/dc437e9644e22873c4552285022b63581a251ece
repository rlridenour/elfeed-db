Lord Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
On this day that we mourn <br></br>
the loss of so many whom you love, <br></br>
it is tempting to pray <br></br>
that you would return <br></br>
and take us from this world.
</p>

 <p>
Tempting, because it shifts <br></br>
the burden to you, <br></br>
leaving nothing for us <br></br>
but escape, evasion, and excuse.
</p>

 <p>
Yet you are not the God who excuses, <br></br>
but the God who redeems; <br></br>
not the God of escape, <br></br>
but the God of the cross.
</p>

 <p>
You are not a passive God, <br></br>
and neither should we <br></br>
be a passive people.
</p>

 <p>
So we pray, <br></br>
not because it is <br></br>
the only thing we can do, <br></br>
but because it is <br></br>
the first thing.
</p>

 <p>
For what should follow, <br></br>
give us the wisdom to know it; <br></br>
grant us the courage to do it.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
