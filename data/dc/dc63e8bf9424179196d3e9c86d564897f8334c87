<p>I&rsquo;ve been waking up around 4 every morning, which I&rsquo;m grateful for because 4&ndash;8am is the only time I really have for coding on my own projects. The lack of sleep is getting to me, but I&rsquo;ve been productive. I&rsquo;m currently working on <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/random-words">a new Lorem Ipsum generator</a> in Ruby that will function as a library, a CLI, and the back end for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/md-lipsum/">md-lipsum</a>. It&rsquo;s not ready for prime time yet, but it&rsquo;s coming along.</p>

<p>But this morning I got distracted by trying to create better off-white backgrounds for web pages. I know it&rsquo;s a simple task with any color picker, but I have trouble getting it fine-tuned enough with sliders, and guessing different hex codes frustrates me. So I made <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//off">a little thing</a> for fine-tuning off-white and off-black background colors.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2025/04/offwhite.jpg"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a hue, saturation, lightness slider, but instead of the lightness going from 0&ndash;100, it only goes from 90&ndash;100, offering granular control even for clumsy users, and then updates the entire background with the selected hue/tint so you can see how it will look on a page. The &ldquo;Off Black&rdquo; version of it changes the lightness slider to 0&ndash;40, offering a little more range for those dark grays.</p>

<p>All put together, it&rsquo;s just called &ldquo;Off.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s for me, but I made it available here just in case somebody else might have a use for it. I amused myself with a little CSS and vanilla JS to make the slider backgrounds work, so at least take a look at it and <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//off">enjoy my latest stupid creation</a>.</p>
