Apple is required to publish energy labels on its <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16-pro">iPhone product pages in the EU</a>, and they reveal the official mAh battery capacities for the devices.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the battery capacities for each model, according to Apple:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>iPhone 17: 3,692 mAh (+3.7% over iPhone 16)</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone Air: 3,149 mAh</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 17 Pro: 4,252 mAh (+18.7% over iPhone 16 Pro)</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 17 Pro Max: 5,088 mAh (+8.6% over iPhone 16 Pro Max)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
These capacities match those <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/08/iphone-17-battery-capacities-allegedly-leaked/">uncovered in a regulatory database</a> a few days ago, but it is unclear if the figures apply to the SIM or eSIM-only models.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-esim-only-countries-list/">still have a SIM card tray in the EU</a>, so it would be reasonable to assume that the battery capacities are for models with a SIM card tray. However, the regulatory database suggested these battery capacities were for eSIM-only models, so the situation is unclear at this time.<br/>
<br/>
As for the iPhone Air, it is eSIM-only worldwide, so its battery capacity will be the same in any country or region of purchase.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the battery capacities for the iPhone 16 series:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16: 3,561 mAh</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16 Plus: 4,674 mAh</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16 Pro: 3,582 mAh</li><br/>
  <li>iPhone 16 Pro Max: 4,685 mAh</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Apple says eSIM-only models of the new iPhones are equipped with a larger battery that fills the space formerly occupied by the physical SIM card tray.<br/>
