<p>UPDATE: Journelly is <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only">now on the App Store</a>.</p>
<p>I've reignited Journelly, my note-taking/journaling project. The iOS app is coming along nicely.</p>
<p>I've been using Journelly daily. The best I can describe the experience is: &quot;kinda like tweeting but for my eyes only&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/journelly-open-for-beta/journelly.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Journelly automatically includes date and time in your entries. Optionally, it'll also include location and weather details.</p>
<p>For now, your entries can include text, images, checkboxes, bullets, and links.</p>
<p>While entering items orally isn't yet possible <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12842">as per Irreal's post</a>, you can use the standard keyboard button to dictate text.</p>

<h2>Powered by plain text (org markup)</h2>
<p>If you're an Emacs org mode fan, you'll be happy to know that Journelly stores data as plain text, using org to structure its entries.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with these things, you don't need to learn any of it to use the app. It's just what's under the hood.</p>
