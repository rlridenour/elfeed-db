         <p>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More
information in the announcement I posted:

<p>In my ~1-hour talk with Gino, I learn about how Emacs is used for data
engineering work. We discuss the use of Org mode for keeping notes and
for producing documents/reports that include prose as well as code
blocks. Part of the discussion revolves around Doom Emacs and how one
can learn about the capabilities of Emacs by relying on a starter kit
until they eventually decide to roll their own configuration. Gino
shares thoughts on contributing to Open Source and to the interactive
side of the Internet at-large, such as with this very talk. In the
last minutes of the video, I ask about Chile’s diverse geography and
the places one could visit there.</p>
