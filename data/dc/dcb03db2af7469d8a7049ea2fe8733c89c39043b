  <p>What if your car worked like so many apps? You’re driving
somewhere important…maybe running a little bit late. A few
minutes into the drive, your car pulls over to the side of the
road and asks:</p>

<p><em>“How are you enjoying your drive so far?”</em></p>

<p>Annoyed by the interruption, and even more behind schedule, you
dismiss the prompt and merge back into traffic.</p>

<p>A minute later it does it again.</p>

<p><em>“Did you know I have a new feature? Tap here to learn more.”</em></p>

<p>It blocks your speedometer with an overlay tutorial about the turn
signal. It highlights the wiper controls and refuses to go away
until you demonstrate mastery.</p>

<p>Ridiculous, of course.</p>

<p>And yet, this is how a lot of modern software behaves. Not because
it’s broken, but because we’ve normalized an interruption model
that would be unacceptable almost anywhere else.</p>

<p>I’ve started to think of this as <em>backseat software</em>: the slow
shift from software as a tool you operate to software as a channel
that operates on you. Once a product learns it can talk back, it’s
remarkably hard to keep it quiet.</p>

<p>This post is about how we got here. Not overnight, but slowly. One
reasonable step at a time.</p>

<p>If that lede pulls you in, like it did for me, you’re going to love the rest of the essay. This is one for the ages. It’s so good.</p>
