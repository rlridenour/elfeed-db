<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Taking a personal #writing habit and mapping it to the realities of work; with a goal of helping keep my work goals salient throughout the quarter.
</p>
        <p><time datetime="2025-01-16" title="2025-01-16">Ereyesterday</time> I wrote 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/01/16/some-entries-from-my-personal-journal/">Some Entries from My Personal Journal</a></cite>, mentioning that
I had adopted my personal journal habit for work.  For a week, I had used the
same capture templates, which produced the same structure.</p>
<p>The experiment worked, but needed refinement.  I was writing engineering journal
entries, but finding that I needed to carry forward blockers.  I chose to sit,
for a bit, without the refinement to ensure that I was sustaining the habit.</p>
<h2 id="clarifying-the-functionality">Clarifying the Functionality</h2>
<p><time datetime="2025-01-17" title="2025-01-17">Yesterday</time>, while waiting on some information to proceed, I started writing out
how I envisioned using my work journal.  I considered my past work, as mentioned
in 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2022/10/24/adding-a-function-to-carry-forward-an-org-mode-agenda-item/">Adding a Function to Carry Forward an Org-Mode Agenda Item</a></cite> and 
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2023/07/29/revisiting-my-org-mode-time-tracking-and-laying-out-a-different-direction/">Revisiting My Org-Mode Time Tracking and Laying out a Different Direction</a></cite>.</p>
<p>However, there was a substantive difference.  At my past work, I was responsible
for tracking my time to specific clients and projects.  In which the accuracy of
the time-sheet was of utmost importance.  In any given week, I might have had 4
or 5 different clients to whom I was billing.</p>
<p>Contrast to my present situation; I don’t bill to a client and I work on a
singular product (albeit with many components).  Instead, I work towards the
completion of quarterly goals.</p>
<p>I wrote the following as code comments before getting started:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

<p>At my current employer, I have quarterly managed business objectives
(MBOs).  These focal activities involve: initiation, tracking work,
and completion (with supporting documentation).</p>
<p><strong>Initiation</strong> :: Writing the stated objective with narrative around
the goal, measurement, and artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking Work</strong> :: As I work through these objectives, I&rsquo;m
recording and tracking tasks towards the larger MBO.  Some tasks
become blocked and I need to work towards their resolution by
providing sustained energy up and out; to get help with my team.</p>
<p><strong>Completion</strong> :: This involves providing documentation demonstrating
the completion of the MBO.  I can leverage the tracking information
to provide the documentation.</p>
<p>The two capture template letters reflect what I&rsquo;m using for my
personal (non-work related) notes.  So I&rsquo;m hoping to piggy back on
that muscle memory as I adopt these tracking approaches.</p>


</blockquote>

<h2 id="reviewing-existing-structures">Reviewing Existing Structures</h2>
<p>I already had my <span>Management by Objectives</span> (<abbr title="Management by Objectives">MbOs</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Management by Objectives”" title="Other site-wide references of “Management by Objectives”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVE">&#128214;</a></small>)
 in an <span><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" title="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ORG-MODE">&#128214;</a></small>
 document.  The structure looked as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-org-mode">* TODO [0/3] 2025-Q1 :mbos:
** TODO Do the thing
** TODO Do the other thing
** TODO Veer left
</code></pre>
<p>The first line is heading level one for the quarterly goals (e.g. “2025-Q1”)
tagged with <code>mbos</code>.  It is in the state <code>TODO</code> with the <code>[0/3]</code> tracking the state of
the sub-headings.</p>
<p>The next three lines are each heading level two.  Each is in a <code>TODO</code> state
followed by their terse name.  They inherit the <code>mbos</code> tag from the parent
heading.</p>
<p>Throughout the quarter, I’d rarely revisit those goals.  Instead, I’d hold them
in the back of my head, and towards quarter end revisit and begin assembling
documentation supporting their completion.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-crease">Finding the Crease</h2>
<p>I then set about thinking of my capture templates from my daily personal habit.
I mapped <kbd>j</kbd> to kicking off the day and <kbd>J</kbd> for appending to
the day.</p>
<p>I wanted to use the <code>BLOCKED</code> status for tasks.  Meaning, I’d want a level 3 (or
more) sub-heading, as that’s where I can easily track things in <span>Org-Mode</span>
.  I
spent a bit of time mapping the previous weeks notes to this newly emerging
structure.</p>
<p>It gave me a good perspective of what I was working on and what was blocked.
And as I started adding time stamps, I could now start seeing things in the
agenda view; that is I could see what my work week included and where I may have
drifted away from tackling a blocker.</p>
<h2 id="make-it-so">Make it So</h2>
<p>I settled on a structure as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-org-mode">* TODO [0/3] 2025-Q1 :mbos:
** TODO [1/2] Do the thing
*** DONE Step 1 :tasks:
*** TODO Step 2 :tasks:
** TODO [0/1] Do the other thing
*** TODO A different step 2 :tasks:
** TODO [0/2] Veer left
*** TODO First you turn :tasks:
*** TODO Then move :tasks:

</code></pre>
<p>A lingering problem is that this does not account for a daily entry that does
not track towards one of my <abbr title="Management by Objectives">MbOs</abbr>
; for example helping get someone else unstuck.
But I can see space for how I’d do that…make another heading level 2 node that I
don’t report.</p>
<h3 id="adding-to-a-task">Adding to a Task</h3>
<p>Here’s the <kbd>J</kbd> capture template, that is append a note to a task.</p>

    ;; The contents-end of the task is the begining of the line that

    (goto-char
      (1- (alist-get task incomplete-mbo-tasks nil nil #'string=)))))
</code></pre>
<p>The inline comments reflect a problem I encountered and how I solved it.</p>
<h3 id="junk-drawer">Junk Drawer</h3>
<p>In reviewing my notes, I found that some entries did not map to tasks.  I <em>could</em>
make them a task, but they were working notes.  So I decided to add a new level
3 headline: “Engineering Journal”.  And tagged it with <code>journals</code>.</p>
<p>The following capture template mimics the <kbd>J</kbd> template (<abbr title="example given">e.g.</abbr>
, append to
a task):</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
  '(&quot;e&quot; &quot;Engineering Journal entry for MBO&quot;
     plain (file+function
             jf/work/filename-for-mbos
             jf/work/position-in-mbo-journal-entry)
     &quot;%T :: %?&quot;
     :empty-lines-before 1
     :empty-lines-after 1
     :clock-in t
     :clock-resume t))
</code></pre>
<p>And the function to perform the capture leverages is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(defun jf/work/position-in-mbo-journal-entry ()
  &quot;Position point just before the selected journal.

Included to allow the re-use of logic for different 3rd level tasks.&quot;
  (let ((jf/work/org-map-entries-mbo-task-filter
          &quot;+LEVEL=3+mbos+tasks+journals&quot;))
    (jf/work/position-at-end-of-mbo-task-entity)))
</code></pre>
<p>I chose to separate the tasks and journal, in part to reduce the selection
process.  However, I might collapse these two.</p>
<h2 id="applying-to-the-personal">Applying to the Personal</h2>
<p>I don’t envision supplanting my personal <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>J</kbd> capture
templates with the more detailed work templates.  However, I’m going to hold
space on how I might use those work steps.  Maybe they can help me accomplish
personal goals?  Or even set them?</p>
