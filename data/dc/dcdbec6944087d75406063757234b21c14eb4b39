Apple's rumored foldable iPhone currently in development features an under-screen camera integrated into the folding display, but the module is unlikely to include TrueDepth components that make up Face ID. That's according to Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PnngRFfih">Digital Chat Station</a> who has sources within the Chinese supply chain. <br/>

On Monday, the leaker revealed the alleged <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/">screen resolutions</a> for the 7.76-inch inner display and the 5.49-inch outer display of Apple's book-style foldable device, and they also claimed that the inner display uses "under-screen camera technology." However, it was not clear whether this meant the TrueDepth system that underlies Face ID would be integrated beneath the screen along with the selfie camera.<br/>
<br/>
The latest tidbit of information clears this up, and suggests that the display will have a single punch-hole camera. It also aligns with industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's claim that Apple's foldable iPhone will <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">forgo Face ID authentication</a>, instead using a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space. Apple already integrates Touch ID into the side button on some iPads, so there's precedent for this.<br/>
<br/>
Integrating Face ID under the screen is difficult because the core components that make up the TrueDepth camera system – like the dot projector and infrared camera – need a clear, unobstructed view to accurately scan your face. Current display layers block or distort infrared light, which degrades the system's ability to create a secure 3D facial map. Fully under-display Face ID will remain a technical hurdle until displays can transmit infrared light cleanly.<br/>
<br/>
That said, it's possible that Apple has already made advances toward achieving such a feat. Apple is also developing a larger 18.8-inch foldable device, and according to Digital Chat Station, one of Apple's engineering prototypes features a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/foldable-ipad-pro-under-display-face-id/">metal superstructure lens</a>" that integrates the receiver and transmitter components of Face ID for under-display facial recognition. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has suggested the "giant" foldable tablet will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/foldable-ipad-likely-set-for-2028-launch/">launch in 2028</a>. Whether the new Face ID technology makes it into the finished device is unknown. <br/>

Apple will launch its long-rumored foldable iPhone late next year with a ~&#36;2,000 premium price tag attached, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/">according to Gurman</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/foldable-iphone-under-screen-camera-no-face-id/">Foldable iPhone&#039;s Under-Screen Camera Likely Won&#039;t Include Face ID</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphones-under-screen-camera-likely-wont-include-face-id.2455343/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
