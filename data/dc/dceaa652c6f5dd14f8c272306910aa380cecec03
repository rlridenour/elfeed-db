An in-person Live Translation feature could soon be available on the AirPods, according to imagery found in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta 6.<br/>

There's a picture of the AirPods with Hello in several different languages, along with a suggestion that the feature will be activated with a double press. The file itself is named "Translate," which certainly seems to imply that there will be a gesture to activate a Live Translation option.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/11/ios-26-beta-hints-at-upcoming-airpods-live-translation-gesture/">9to5Mac</a></em> reported on the image first, but we can confirm that it is tucked away in the files for the Translate app in the latest beta.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to the launch of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that the AirPods would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/airpods-live-translation-ios-19/">get a translate feature</a> for translating in-person conversations, and it looks like Apple is working on introducing it soon. Live Translation for AirPods could come either in the launch version of &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, or in an update to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; already offers Live Translation for the Phone app, Messages app, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, so an in-person option through the AirPods makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the images, the feature will work on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>. Existing Live Translation features are linked to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, which means the AirPods feature could also require an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that supports &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/live-translation-coming-to-airpods/">Live Translation Coming to AirPods</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/live-translation-coming-to-airpods.2463207/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
