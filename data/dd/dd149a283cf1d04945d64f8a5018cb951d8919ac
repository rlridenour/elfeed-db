  <p>Ever notice Claude struggling to write Swift code? It might not be
their fault!</p>

<p>Apple Developer docs are locked behind JavaScript, making them
invisible to most LLMs. If they try to fetch it, all they see is
“<em>This page requires JavaScript. Please turn on JavaScript in your
browser and refresh the page to view its content.</em>”</p>

<p>This service translates Apple Developer documentation pages into
AI-friendly Markdown.</p>

<p>Perfect little audio easter egg on the page. Beautiful Markdown output too. Look at <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">my boy</a>, all grown up, teaching robots how to program.</p>

<p>I do regret, though, that I didn’t define or influence the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks">fenced style for code blocks</a>. If I had, instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>```swift
// An array of 'Int' elements
let oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
```
</code></pre>

<p>You could do this, which looks so much better:</p>

<pre><code>``` Swift:
// An array of 'Int' elements
let oddNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
```
</code></pre>

<p>Those all-lowercase language identifiers, with no preceding space, just look a little lazy. I realize why GitHub’s <code>```</code>-fenced code blocks took off (they’re the only code block style most Markdown users know, I suspect), but they <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/31/sosumi-ai.text">don’t look nearly as nice</a>, to human readers, as <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#precode">my original tab-indented style</a>.</p>
