I have been really enjoying the more concentration workflow <a href="http://www.qtile.org/">qtile</a>, a tiling window manager, brings me, since I started using it a few months ago. I am more focus on the current task now as all the windows I care about are laid out on the same screen.</p>
<p>
As I get more used to qtile at every day&#39;s work, I noticed that I became more depend on short-life terminal sessions. Sometimes I need to quickly execute some commands on the current buffer on <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, such as searching text which having many matches and quit that terminal after I&#39;m done. So I wondered what could be the best way to achieve that.</p>
