<p id="p2">If you haven&rsquo;t noticed, it&rsquo;s not Friday, and Thanksgiving is still a week away. Yet here we are, talking about Black Friday deals. That&rsquo;s because every year, Amazon pushes the start of its deals a little earlier.</p>
<p id="p3">This is far from the first article you&rsquo;ll come across about Black Friday deals, and it won&rsquo;t be the last. But what&rsquo;s different about our approach to Black Friday is that we&rsquo;re pickier than most sites.</p>
<p id="p4">When I sat down to consider Amazon&rsquo;s Black Friday deals, I looked at a long list of factors, including:</p>
<ul id="ul5"><li>whether we&rsquo;ve reviewed and recommended a product on MacStories,</li>
<li>the percentage of the discount,</li>
<li>the absolute dollar amount of the discount (which we can&rsquo;t list due to Amazon rules), </li>
<li>whether each deal beats past deals,</li>
<li>and a bunch of other factors.</li>
</ul><p id="p6">What we&rsquo;ve come up with is a list of a couple dozen excellent deals that will save you loads of money on everything from great holiday gifts to nerd staples like storage, networking gear, and upgrades to your computing setup.</p>
<p id="p7">Every time I write one of these roundups, I inevitably run across even more great deals after the story has been published. So in addition to this story, we&rsquo;ll be posting deals on the MacStories Deals <a href="https://mastodon.macstories.net/@MacStoriesDeals" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/macstoriesdeals.macstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a> accounts.</p>
<p id="p8">Club MacStories Plus and Premier members will be sharing their Black Friday deal finds <a href="https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/1407403829108150393" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Discord</a> too. If you&rsquo;re not a member, you can sign up <a href="https://club.macstories.net/plans" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The Discord server is just one of the many perks of joining the Club.</p>

<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-18-1763656136197.jpg" alt="Some of Amazon's best deals are on storage."><p class="image-caption">Some of Amazon&rsquo;s best deals are on storage.</p></div>
<p id="p11">Storage is a staple of Black Friday, with excellent deals on hard drives and SSDs of all shapes and sizes. This year is no different. Whether your Mac&rsquo;s drive is filling up and you need to offload some large files or you&rsquo;re looking for a backup solution, now is the time to pull the trigger and get more storage.</p>
<p id="p12">I mention Samsung portable SSDs a lot on MacStories and the MacStories Deals accounts because I&rsquo;ve used them for years and they&rsquo;re reliable. Samsung&rsquo;s fastest model &ndash; the T9 &ndash; is my favorite because it uses USB-C 3.2 Gen 2x2, making it equally good for quick backups and working on large files externally.</p>
<p id="p13">Currently, both the <a href="https://amzn.to/4oPXGuL" rel="noopener noreferrer">4TB Samsung T9</a> SSD and <a href="https://amzn.to/4rbU4oj" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 2TB model</a> are on sale on Amazon, with the biggest discount on the 4TB model. You can save a little more with <a href="https://amzn.to/3XEX6UA" rel="noopener noreferrer">SanDisk&rsquo;s 2TB external drive</a>, but it runs at half the speed of the Samsung T9, so I recommend the T9. However, if you want to go really big with an SSD, SanDisk has Samsung beat with <a href="https://amzn.to/43ACMY4" rel="noopener noreferrer">an 8TB model</a> that, while expensive and half the speed of a Samsung T9, will be far faster than a mechanical hard drive for backing up a Mac with lots of internal storage. Samsung sadly does not offer an 8TB T9 drive.</p>
<p id="p14">SSDs are great, but even on sale, they&rsquo;re more expensive than mechanical hard drives. If you don&rsquo;t need the fastest speeds and can tuck your hard drive away somewhere the heat and noise won&rsquo;t bother you, Amazon has a great deal on <a href="https://amzn.to/488uVlM" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 14TB Western Digital Elements hard drive</a>. I&rsquo;ve used Elements drives a lot over the past several years for archiving big projects and Time Machine backups, and I&rsquo;ve been very happy with their performance. If you need a big drive, now is the time to pick one of these up; they&rsquo;ve never been cheaper.</p>

<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-19-1763656703444.jpg" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p16">For starters, the <a href="https://amzn.to/49oPdK9" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aqara 4MP Camera Hub G5 Pro</a> is deeply discounted for Black Friday. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/rugged-reliable-and-homekit-ready-a-review-of-aqaras-g5-pro-outdoor-camera-hub/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I reviewed this outdoor HomeKit-compatible camera</a> earlier this year and love it. From the feedback I&rsquo;ve heard, MacStories readers seem to love the camera, too.</p>
<p id="p17">I also <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/philips-hue-adds-flexibility-to-the-play-line-with-new-wall-washer-lights/" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewed</a> <a href="https://amzn.to/3X2ORl7" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K</a> this summer. Paired with Philips Hue lights, it&rsquo;s remarkably capable, syncing the colors of your lights to whatever is on your TV. While it&rsquo;s not a smart home essential, it is a lot of fun, and if you need a little push to pull the trigger on this sort of gadget, this discount is a great excuse.</p>
<p id="p18">On the more practical end of the spectrum, Philips Hue is also offering a great deal on its <a href="https://amzn.to/3LTZyE4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Smart Portable Table Lamp</a>, which works plugged in or via its built-in battery. I&rsquo;ve had my eye on this lamp for a while because it&rsquo;s very portable and would add nice accent lighting when I&rsquo;m working on my balcony in the evening or anywhere else with less-than-ideal lighting.</p>
<p id="p19">Finally, as I mentioned on <a href="https://youtu.be/-RhQhl_QuJI" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Setups video that Federico and I recently released</a>, I love my new <a href="https://amzn.to/4pruTwB" rel="noopener noreferrer">SwitchBot Smart Desk Fan</a>. It oscillates left and right as well as up and down, and it has nine speed settings. Best of all, I can control it from the buttons on the front of the device, using the included remote control, or with Shortcuts because it works with HomeKit.</p>

<h2 id="headphones">Headphones</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-20-1763656885209.jpg" alt="Amazon has great deals on Beats headphones."><p class="image-caption">Amazon has great deals on Beats headphones.</p></div>
<p id="p22">Headphones are another Black Friday staple and make great holiday gifts. If you&rsquo;re looking for a new set for yourself or someone else, here are three recommendations:</p>
<ul id="ul23"><li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3LVpsr0" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beats Studio Pro</a></strong>: Great sound and long battery life combined with active noise cancellation and excellent integration with Apple devices make these headphones a fantastic buy, especially at their current deeply discounted price.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/47Rp99t" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beat Solo 4</a></strong>: A great on-ear wireless option from Beats that&rsquo;s lightweight and has exceptional battery life; it&rsquo;s a favorite of MacStories&rsquo; Devon Dundee.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/4i7oDYe" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4</a></strong>: Sennheiser is known for its attention to sound quality, and while I haven&rsquo;t tried these over-ear wireless headphones myself, the discount being offered on Amazon is great. Coupled with long battery life and active noise cancellation, they&rsquo;re worth a look.</li>
</ul><h2 id="apple-gear-and-accessories">Apple Gear and Accessories</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-21-1763657199727.jpg" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p25">Now is a very good time to pick up a <a href="https://amzn.to/4oRde1r" rel="noopener noreferrer">13&rdquo; M4 MacBook Air</a>, a <a href="https://amzn.to/3X9tgHF" rel="noopener noreferrer">15&rdquo; M4 MacBook Air</a>, or an <a href="https://amzn.to/4r4o4m1" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPad mini</a>. Apple has several items on sale on Amazon, but these are the best in my opinion.</p>
<p id="p26">When it comes to accessories, here are some of my favorite deals, along with links to reviews I&rsquo;ve done on MacStories:</p>
<p id="p27">The <a href="https://amzn.to/4o8OQaq" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insta360 Flow 2 Pro Creator</a> iPhone gimbal is on sale on Amazon. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/whats-in-my-ces-bag/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I took this model&rsquo;s predecessor with me to CES</a> this year and loved it. This version has some nice incremental updates, and the bundle includes all the accessories you need for filming with your iPhone.</p>
<p id="p28">Logitech&rsquo;s Flip Folio Keyboard Case, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/logitechs-flip-folio-a-modular-ipad-keyboard-for-occasional-typing/" rel="noopener noreferrer">which I reviewed in June</a>, is on sale too. It&rsquo;s an iPad Pro case with a kickstand and a separate keyboard that attaches magnetically to the outside of the case. It&rsquo;s an interesting design that&rsquo;s well suited to people who only use a keyboard occasionally. Both the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Mbct4A" rel="noopener noreferrer">11&rdquo; model</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/4pdslli" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 13&rdquo; model</a> are on sale.</p>
<p id="p29">Logitech is also offering a great deal on the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Maia2G" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combo Touch Keyboard Case</a> for the 11&rdquo; iPad Pro and <a href="https://amzn.to/4498Xhm" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 13&rdquo; iPad Pro</a>. Like the Flip Folio, this case has a kickstand, but its keyboard is attached and includes a trackpad, too.</p>
<p id="p30">Logitech has gone all out with Amazon Black Friday deals, also discounting the <a href="https://amzn.to/3KepJF5" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keys-to-Go 2 portable keyboard</a> that I use with a variety of devices, including my iPad Pro, because it&rsquo;s incredibly light and offers a good typing experience considering its slim design.</p>
<h2 id="networking-gear">Networking Gear</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-22-1763657287171.jpg" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p32">I have two picks in this category. The first is <a href="https://amzn.to/4poznE1" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GL.iNet GL-BE3600 (Slate 7) Portable Travel Router</a>, which you&rsquo;ll find in my section of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/setups/#portable-setup" rel="noopener noreferrer">the MacStories Setups page</a>. That&rsquo;s quite a mouthful for a tiny router that runs at very low power and does everything from extending a weak Wi-Fi network to creating a Wi-Fi network of its own by tethering to your iPhone. That versatility and the Slate 7&rsquo;s support for Wi-Fi 7 make it a great device for anyone who works on a Mac or iPad on the go.</p>
<p id="p33">My second networking recommendation is <a href="https://amzn.to/3KbJwVG" rel="noopener noreferrer">the TRENDnet 8-port 2.5Gb Switch</a>. Seeing the discount on this switch pains me because I paid a lot more for it when 2.5Gb switches were less common. I&rsquo;ve been running mine for a few years, and it&rsquo;s reliably delivered fast speeds to my desktop Mac 24/7.</p>
