<p>I watched the first 3 episodes  of <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/127366/season/1">Splinter Cell: Deathwatch Season 1</a> 📺. Yeah&hellip; not great. I didn&rsquo;t expect something amazing, but I guess I had hopes for this one. The story fills flat and a bit cliche, rushed. I&rsquo;ll probably finish it since there are only 8 episodes.</p>
