<p>Devlin Barrett and Tyler Pager, reporting for The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Trump is demanding that the Justice Department pay him
about $230 million in compensation for the federal investigations
into him, according to people familiar with the matter, who added
that any settlement might ultimately be approved by senior
department officials who defended him or those in his orbit.</p>

<p>The situation has no parallel in American history, as Mr. Trump, a
presidential candidate, was pursued by federal law enforcement and
eventually won the election, taking over the very government that
must now review his claims. It is also the starkest example yet of
potential ethical conflicts created by installing the president’s
former lawyers atop the Justice Department.</p>

<p>Subject only to the approval of his own lickspittle cronies.</p>

  <p>In the world where Antonin Scalia dies six months earlier and RBG
retires at some point before the third cancer diagnosis, a
bankrupt Trump sits in a maximum security prison and costs us a
single Secret Service patrol.</p>
