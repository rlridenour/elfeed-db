The shows are available to watch on United's more than 130,000 seatback screens, and in the United app. At launch, the airline is offering the first seasons of <em>Severance</em>, <em>Shrinking</em>, <em>Ted Lasso</em>, <em>Slow Horses</em>, and <em>Silo</em>, with <em>The Morning Show</em> and <em>Bad Sisters</em> to be added this September. Additional content will be added each month.<br/>
<br/>
United eventually plans to have 300,000 seatback screens across its fleet, as it takes delivery of hundreds of new airplanes and retrofits existing aircraft.<br/>
<br/>
This latest partnership between United and Apple provides the airline's passengers with an additional entertainment perk, while giving hit Apple TV+ shows more exposure. With only the first seasons of hit shows currently available, the passengers may be inclined to subscribe to Apple TV+ to keep watching the shows.<br/>
<br/>
United also supports Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/25/united-airlines-live-activities/">Live Activities</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/united-delta-air-canada-find-my-luggage/">Share Item Location</a> features.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., Apple's streaming service is priced at &#36;9.99 per month, or &#36;99 per year. It is also bundled in all Apple One plans.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-airlines/">United Airlines</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/united-airlines-apple-tv-plus/">United Airlines Now Lets You Watch Hit Apple TV+ Shows For Free</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/united-airlines-now-lets-you-watch-hit-apple-tv-shows-for-free.2463229/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
