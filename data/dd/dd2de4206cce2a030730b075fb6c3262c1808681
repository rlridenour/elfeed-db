Apple mentioned the expansion in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-vision-pro-upgraded-with-the-m5-chip-and-dual-knit-band/">press release</a> for the new Vision Pro with the M5 chip. The Vision Pro app was first introduced earlier this year with iOS 18.4, giving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users the ability to browse and download apps, games, and media experiences for the Vision Pro without needing to wear the headset.<br/>
<br/>
The app features a Discover page that highlights curated recommendations for "new and noteworthy experiences available on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>," including categories such as Immersive Video, 3D movies, and other spatial apps. The My Vision Pro page within the app provides device-specific information and tools. The app also includes guest management features. <br/>
