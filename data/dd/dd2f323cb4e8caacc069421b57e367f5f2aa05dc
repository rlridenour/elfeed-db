<p>In this ~1-hour video I talk with Gavin about all sorts of interesting
topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how I got into Emacs and what I do with it</li>
  <li>the Vim paradigm and structural editing</li>
  <li>programming and writing prose have different requirements</li>
  <li>living in a city and then going to the mountains</li>
  <li>how taking a step back can help you be in control</li>
  <li>physical activity, hikes, and the like</li>
  <li>what kind of philosophy I do</li>
  <li>whether people should study philosophy</li>
  <li>if I am drawn to the academic philosophical discourse and what I
think about it</li>
  <li>whether we should have an interest in politics</li>
  <li>how I see politics and why I focus on common sense</li>
  <li>if I could change society, what I would try to do</li>
  <li>how we take freedoms for granted and why this can be a mistake</li>
  <li>the idea of small communities organising their collective life</li>
</ul>
