<p>India and the European Union announced a free trade agreement in New Delhi after nearly two decades of negotiations, aiming to deepen economic links alongside broader strategic cooperation. The deal is expected to cut or eliminate tariffs across large parts of bilateral trade, including autos and several industrial and pharmaceutical categories, creating new openings for companies and consumers on both sides. Several accounts describe the pact as partly shaped by today’s tougher geopolitical and trade climate, including pressure from Washington and Europe’s desire to diversify as it manages trade frictions with the United States and a large deficit with China. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer publicly argued the agreement appears to favor India, while European leaders framed it as a high-ambition partnership with major economic upside.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/41jpIF0xU00oAIo-l2Zr9oO8tZsf0Fh4_J-EYYweZaxrN5hvVTZ1qHRCFI_42EiJUWOs3SJG8pN3QhQwVrNJ51JFx9yFXbd_QEYV4SWyQ1cGFg0tNGjCuTnmRDh9Ic0SPtEiGcAF7qC1k7vls4XgtGjNhNUoo6pkVODt5dcVJUT413myOcSxexY_P0lDsYKMXyf1_D3-zUcRd32WvhaUBnc' alt='Representative photo accompanying coverage of the EU-India trade agreement announcement.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tariff coverage: The agreement is set to reduce or remove tariffs on 96.6% of the EU’s tariff lines covered in the deal, according to reporting on the finalized text and scope.</li><li>Export target: EU officials and coverage of the pact cite an ambition to roughly double the bloc’s exports to India by 2032, underscoring the long-run commercial bet behind the agreement.</li><li>Co-creation focus: Industry voices promoting the deal emphasize “co-creation” through joint manufacturing, R&amp;D collaboration, and green-technology partnerships as a key dividend beyond simple tariff cuts.</li><li>U.S. criticism: Jamieson Greer said India “came out ‘on top’” and criticized the EU on market access and immigration, contrasting it with the President Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.</li><li>Political framing: An NDTV opinion piece argues the pact’s significance goes beyond tariffs and sits within a wider push for great-power dealmaking and treaty-making in a shifting global order.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Commission: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the agreement as “the mother of all trade deals,” presenting it as a cornerstone for expanding EU-India economic ties.
