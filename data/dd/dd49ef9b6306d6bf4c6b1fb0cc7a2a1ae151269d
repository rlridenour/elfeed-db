<p>Denmark and Greenland said their sovereignty is “not negotiable” after President Trump said he reached a framework with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte that would give the United States “total access” to Greenland as part of a future Arctic security arrangement. Greenland’s prime minister said he had not been informed of the framework’s contents and stressed that any agreement affecting Greenland must involve Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark. Reporting on the talks says ideas under discussion include renegotiating the 1951 U.S.-Denmark defense pact and proposals related to U.S. military basing and limiting Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic, though details remain unclear and disputed.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/6OcVQPycAwkKk1oKvZ5BjCZC4Q8Q7rdUDAhQAdkW03hm9DQgIetCP7XZoM87rsDp52UJAP2dd21hGPYNweRb7pTDNPFE1w1U87874GAy8SIA' alt='Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen speaks at a press conference in Nuuk, January 22, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>1951 pact review: A source familiar with the discussions said the framework includes renegotiating the 1951 defense agreement governing U.S.-Danish arrangements in Greenland.</li><li>Basing sovereignty: American and NATO officials discussed giving the United States sovereignty over pockets of land hosting U.S. facilities in Greenland, an idea Denmark opposes.</li><li>No force pledge: President Trump publicly ruled out using military force to take Greenland, and Greenland’s prime minister said he welcomed that shift even while seeking clarity on the framework.</li><li>Arctic constraints: Proposals in the talks include provisions intended to curb Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic, including limits on their activities tied to Greenland.</li><li>Crisis cooling: One analysis said the standoff has eased for now after the Trump–Rutte talks, even as allies debate whether the emerging provisions are sufficient.</li></ul><blockquote>Nobody else than Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark have the mandate to make deals or agreements about Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark without us - Jens-Frederik Nielsen</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Greenland: Greenland’s prime minister said he did not know what was in the announced framework and insisted no deal can be made without Greenland’s involvement, citing “red lines” on territorial integrity, sovereignty and international law.
