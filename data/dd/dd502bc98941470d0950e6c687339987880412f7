<p>President Donald Trump has warned Cuba to “make a deal” with Washington, saying Venezuelan oil and money that have supported the island in recent years will stop after Nicolás Maduro was removed from power in Venezuela. The message follows major upheaval in Venezuela, where US forces seized Maduro in an operation that reportedly killed dozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel. Cuban leaders rejected the warning and defended Cuba’s right to obtain fuel from willing exporters, arguing the US approach escalates tensions and undermines sovereignty.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/IFJijN3iZzSQ-vQQYL2FQf3gg89FNdelNmhdU1__Bf5IaaB9Le1McGlrkpu5hlfftx1JEoE-sR-o4ii0DO-_pMYTnjs7-yrdB7SHyTAESflZbXWL26RJiLZI6masmB5UIN7VouupGHTWWQlBiChuPbxuVVwm0qU5JV6jIpIt8A8Kjki9gvxXgUczP5Rs74ifuaYyQhCVIY9YtMTbPNH2jw' alt='President Trump speaks as Washington increases pressure on Cuba.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Stated US goals: Asked later about the warning, President Trump said he wanted people forced out of Cuba or who “left under duress” to be “taken care of,” without detailing what a “deal” would include.</li><li>Rubio remark: Trump reposted a message suggesting Secretary of State Marco Rubio could become Cuba’s president, adding “Sounds good to me!”.</li><li>Energy lifeline: Cuba’s dependence on imported fuel has long been tied to arrangements with Venezuela dating back to the early 2000s, with Mexico also cited as a fuel source in recent years.</li><li>Prisoner releases: CBS reported Trump said Venezuela has “started the process” of releasing political prisoners in the wake of recent events there.</li><li>Cuba’s strains: Firstpost described Cuba as facing blackouts, fuel shortages, and deep economic strain as Washington increases pressure.</li></ul><blockquote>THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA — ZERO! - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US President Donald Trump: Trump argues Cuba benefited from Venezuelan oil and money while providing “security services,” and says that support will end unless Havana reaches an unspecified deal with Washington.
