<p>There is a library I rely on constantly in my day to day computing, at work and at home.
This library is called <a href="https://github.com/jacktasia/dumb-jump">dumb-jump</a>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see it is prized as often as Magit for example, which made me write this post.</p>
<p>Below I explain what it does but first, let me thank to <strong>Jack Angers</strong> and all the contributors.
I have used this library for 10 years. It is one of the best computer programs I have ever used.
There were periods when I was off Emacs during that time and the first thing I looked for in other editors was a plugin similar to dumb-jump.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-do">What does it do</h2>
<p>It jumps to definition of a function/method/class.</p>
<p>Here is my config for it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">use-package</span> dumb-jump
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#e6db74">:ensure</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">t</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#e6db74">:config</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> (add-hook <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;xref-backend-functions</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">#&#39;</span>dumb-jump-xref-activate)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> (<span style="color:#66d9ef">setq</span> dumb-jump-force-searcher <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;rg</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#75715e">;; use completion-read instead of a separate buffer with candidates</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> (<span style="color:#66d9ef">setq</span> xref-show-definitions-function <span style="color:#a6e22e">#&#39;</span>xref-show-definitions-completing-read))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Combined with <a href="https://github.com/dajva/rg.el">rg</a> it eliminated my need in LSPs or ctags/etags entirely.</p>
<p>Here is me using it on Emacs source code, which is big code base (click to view the video in a separate tab):</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://codelearn.me/assets/video/dumbjump-in-action.mov"><video src="https://codelearn.me/assets/video/dumbjump-in-action.mov" width="100%"/></a></p>
<p>In this video I:</p>
<ul>
<li>press <code>M-.</code> to go to definition.</li>
<li>In less than a second I get matching definitions that I can filter if necessary.</li>
<li>I jump straight to the definition.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h2>
<p>It just greps the entire project for the symbol at point. The best thing about it is that with LSP for example it&rsquo;s impossible
(or rather I haven&rsquo;t seen it working) to place my cursor over a function name in a comment somewhere and jump to it.</p>
<p>Like in:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">/**
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"> * This test function is cool but
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"> * check another_function_name for more info
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"> */</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">function</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">test</span>() {}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With dumb-jump - I can place my cursor at <strong>another_function_name</strong>, press <strong>M-.</strong> and I&rsquo;m looking at the definition of it.</p>
<p>It works with <strong>ANY</strong> programming language.</p>
<h2 id="why-not">Why not</h2>
<h3 id="ctagsetags">ctags/etags</h3>
<p>Every time a file is changed the ctags table must be regenerated. It can be automated but I think it&rsquo;s unnecessary overhead.</p>
<h3 id="lsp-eglot">LSP (Eglot)</h3>
<p>I love LSP as a technology but I don&rsquo;t want a background process to run on my machine while I&rsquo;m working on a project.
What if during the day I work on 10 projects, which is real for me at work for example. It will spawn 10 background processes
for different languages that I have to mentally track (because I do mentally track what&rsquo;s running in my computing environment).</p>
<p>The amount of RAM and CPU spent on this just feels too expensive.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>If for some reason you haven&rsquo;t tried this library - try. It&rsquo;s so good.</p>
<p>I wish I can find better words on how grateful I am that it exists. Thank you!</p>
