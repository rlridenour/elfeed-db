  <p>Well, would you look at that? The A18 Pro is 46% faster than the
M1 in single-core tasks, and almost identical to the M1 on
multi-core and graphics tasks. If you wanted to get rid of the M1
MacBook Air but have decided that even today, its performance
characteristics make it perfectly suitable as a low-cost Mac
laptop, building a new model on the A18 Pro would not be a bad
move. It wouldn’t have Thunderbolt, only USB-C, but that’s not a
dealbreaker on a cheap laptop. It might re-use parts from the M1
Air, including the display.</p>

<p>I like that Apple sells a laptop at $649, and I think Apple likes
it, too. A new low-end model might steal some buyers from the $999
MacBook Air, but I’d wager it would reach a lot of customers who
might otherwise not buy a full-priced Mac — the same ones buying
M1 MacBook Airs at Walmart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My first thought when I saw this rumor pop up was to dismiss it. But upon consideration, I think it makes sense. Especially if Apple considers the M1 MacBook Air at Walmart to be a success. And all signs point to “yes” on that — they started selling the M1 MacBook Air as a $700 Walmart exclusive <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/15/macbook-air-walmart">in March 2024</a> and they <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/walmart-macbook-air">continue to sell it this year</a> at just $650.</p>

<p>So I think if this rumor pans out, a MacBook at this price point will become a standard part of the lineup, sold everywhere — including Apple Stores.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The immediate downside to the A18 Pro is that it only supports USB
3 at 10 Gb/s, not Thunderbolt. This would make any Mac with an A18
at its heart only capable of USB-C. I think that’s fine on a
low-end Mac, but it could cause confusion for some customers.</p>

<p>For people looking at MacBooks in this price range, talking about USB 3 vs. Thunderbolt brings to mind <a href="https://desertdemocrat.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/blah-blah-blah-blah-ginger/">this classic <em>Far Side</em> cartoon</a>.</p>
