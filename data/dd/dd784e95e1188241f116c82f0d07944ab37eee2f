<p>A few weeks ago, I <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/ready-player-mode">announced Ready Player Mode</a>'s availability on <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player">GitHub</a>. As of today, you can <a href="https://melpa.org/#/ready-player">find it on MELPA</a>.</p>
<p>Ready Player Mode is a lightweight major mode to open media (audio/video) files in an Emacs buffer.</p>
<p>Install, enable via <code>M-x ready-player-mode</code> and you should be good to go.</p>
<p>Open and preview media files (audio + video) like other files. If in repeat mode, ready-player attempts to play other files in the current directory. Track playback from the corresponding <code>dired</code> buffer.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/ready-player-mode-now-on-melpa/ready-player.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Playback is handled by your favourite command line utility. <code>ready-player-mode</code> will try to use either <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a>, <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">vlc</a>, <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html">ffplay</a>, or <a href="https://mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html">mplayer</a> (in that order), but you can customize that. I'd love to hear of other defaults worth considering.</p>
<p>Bonus rendering includes media thumbnails and metadata, if either <a href="https://github.com/dirkvdb/ffmpegthumbnailer">ffmpegthumbnailer</a> or <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> are found.</p>
