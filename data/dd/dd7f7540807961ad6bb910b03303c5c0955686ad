<p>The White House has announced a “Board of Peace” that President Trump will chair to supervise a transitional period in Gaza focused on governance, reconstruction and investment, as part of a second phase of a U.S. plan following an October ceasefire arrangement. Named members include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, Jared Kushner, US envoy Steve Witkoff, World Bank Group president Ajay Banga, Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan and others. In parallel, a Palestinian technocratic committee intended to help administer Gaza under U.S. supervision held its first meeting in Cairo, with its leader Ali Shaath saying the group aims to move quickly on urgent needs like shelter and anticipates reconstruction taking about three years. While supporters portray the initiative as a practical step toward stabilizing and rebuilding a war-damaged territory, critics in the region and beyond object to some appointments and to the U.S.-led oversight model for Gaza’s future governance.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/UBUPYsNbgPKObfXX_6doOLp_3X3Gw84DDdqdEdvUppeOo9lzFxBa0GEcZw3YHCL8Vbvtwl4zaA29ugD5UfCkr1M-scr-TnfosjTBAjR9KvkpGFnJzk35tF6yCJRx1Ot0-3S6o5lxslqZwEr1bZB2m_0IJEd_5q2237KN-pZvQK-P9BfzSqmrOAcBSDH8I2qYfjMmiAPdXgLGB7kQxLAlkq_YFasdpWmEsitTTrXKn3Jf-qqXVuHxwp_PkeGlJBYRM1SNeVpvH8fMUq5jCw' alt='Palestinians inspect rubble after a strike in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, Jan. 16, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Security force: President Trump also appointed a U.S. officer to lead a nascent security force envisioned for post-war Gaza, according to reports on the plan’s security track.</li><li>Phase two focus: Envoy Steve Witkoff described the shift as moving “from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction,” and warned Hamas of “serious consequences” if it does not meet obligations, including returning a final deceased hostage.</li><li>Ceasefire context: Reporting notes Gaza has still seen deadly violence despite a ceasefire that took effect in October, underscoring the fragility of the security environment the plan aims to address.</li><li>Regional mediators: Witkoff publicly credited Egypt, Turkey and Qatar as “indispensable” in advancing the earlier ceasefire-and-exchange agreement that preceded this new governance and rebuilding push.</li><li>Board remit: The White House described the board’s portfolio as spanning governance capacity-building, regional relations and reconstruction financing, including investment attraction and large-scale capital mobilization.</li></ul><blockquote>Today, on behalf of President Trump, we are announcing the launch of Phase Two… moving from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction. - Steve Witkoff</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House / President Trump: The administration presents the Trump-chaired board as the executive structure to oversee Gaza’s transitional governance and to drive reconstruction and investment mobilization.
