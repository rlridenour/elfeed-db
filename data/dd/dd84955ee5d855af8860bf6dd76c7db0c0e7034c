<p>Brian X. Chen, in a column at The New York Times headlined “Why a Tariff-Inflated $2,000 iPhone Is Nothing to Fear”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t panic. Even if tariffs did cause the iPhone’s price to
surge, we would have plenty of cheaper options, like buying last
year’s phone model instead of the latest and greatest.</p>

<p>The most important lesson we can learn from the turmoil: The only
consistent way to save money on tech is to use devices for as long
as possible, which requires maintaining them as you would a car,
and upgrading only when you must.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This whole angle is no surprise coming from the tech columnist whose advice to readers who think their aging phone cameras don’t perform well in low light is “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/09/you_could_always_just_use_flash">Just use flash</a>.” If phone prices go up because of Trump’s tariffs, <em>all</em> phone prices are going to go up, including those for older models, whether you’re buying new or used. There is no silver lining here. Spending more to get a years-old phone sucks too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take the iPhone 16 as an example. Its $800 price tag can easily
inflate to $1,080, since you may also buy:</p>

<ul>
<li>An iPhone case for $50</li>
<li>AirPods for $130</li>
<li>256 gigabytes of storage for $100</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you buy things that aren’t an iPhone — like AirPods — the price of an iPhone goes up. Got it.</p>

<p>The anti-“big tech” bias here is so obvious. Don’t hold your breath waiting for a similar article in the Times about how it’s no big deal, nothing to worry about, if the price of cars doubles under these tariffs.</p>
