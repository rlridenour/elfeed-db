<p>Nilay Patel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a lot of tactical stuff you might talk about in the
aftermath of this ruling — about what Apple might do next, how it
might impact revenue, and how developers might respond. But I
really wanted Gruber to talk about Apple’s big picture and how a
company that so often prides itself on doing the right thing ended
up so fully on the wrong side of the courts.</p>

<p>One theme you’ll hear throughout this conversation is that Apple
often presents itself as small, but the company is actually huge
in every way — Apple now sells nearly as many phones in a single
quarter as it did in the entire first three years of the iPhone’s
existence combined. It now operates in a geopolitical context that
binds the United States, China, and Taiwan in ways you would have
never imagined 15 years ago. And perhaps most importantly, Apple
has control over applications on the iPhone, which means it has
control over what kinds of businesses can and cannot exist on its
mobile phones.</p>

<p>That’s the context for the other major theme here that you’ll pick
up on in this conversation: Apple’s major shift toward digital
services and whether that’s fundamentally changed the company’s
culture. You see, as Apple kept selling newer and better iPhones,
it simply ran out of people to sell them to. So, in order to keep
growing revenue and keep Wall Street happy, it started squeezing
more money from its existing customer base, including the very
developers that put apps on the App Store.</p>

<p>Good episode, if I do say so myself.</p>
