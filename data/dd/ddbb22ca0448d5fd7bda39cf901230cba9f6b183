I&rsquo;m a GNUs user and am pretty happy with it. However, I have a &ldquo;Sent&rdquo; message group where the summary line is the same as everywhere else, meaning it includes the author (me!) and not the recipient. How can I change the summary line format in just the outgoing buffers (or, alternatively, if the author is me)?
For reference, here&rsquo;s my current insensitive line-format variable:
(setq gnus-summary-line-format &#34;%U%R%([%-30,30f]:%) %-50,40s(%&amp;user-date;)\n&#34;) The winning solution?
