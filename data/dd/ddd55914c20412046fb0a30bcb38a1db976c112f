<p>I really enjoyed <a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/iphones-17-and-the-sugar-water-trap/">today’s Stratechery piece by Ben Thompson</a>, which tries to understand how Apple can have an impressive roll-out of some really good new products, and yet it all seems so much quieter than it used to:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I have, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/boomer-apple/">for the last several years</a>, noted how, from a Stratechery perspective, iPhone launches just aren’t nearly as big of a deal as they were when I first started. Back then I would spend weeks before the event predicting what Apple would announce, and would spend weeks afterwards breaking down the implications; now I usually dash off an Update that, in recent years, has been dominated by <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/apples-iphone-event-innovation-and-iteration-pricing-inflation-and-services/">discussions about price and elasticity</a> and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/the-services-iphone/">Apple’s transition to being a services company</a>.</p>
<p>  What was shocking to me, however, was actually watching the event in real time: my group chats and X feed acknowledged that the event was happening, but I had the distinct impression that almost no one was paying much attention, which was not at all the case a decade ago. And, particularly when it comes to tech discussion, you can understand why: by far the biggest thing in tech — and on Stratechery — is AI, and Apple simply isn’t a meaningful player.
