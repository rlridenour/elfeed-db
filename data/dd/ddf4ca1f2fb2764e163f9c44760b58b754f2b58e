A few days ago I wrote about my need for <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12842">something better than the Apple Notes app for my memo book</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using Notes for 10 years and it works well but I&rsquo;d like something that takes care of adding time stamps for me and is a little more seamless.

I wrote that I&rsquo;d discovered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1j393t5/journelly_kinda_like_tweeting_but_for_your_eyes/">Journelly</a> and that it seemed like it might be a good fit for my needs but that it was still pre-beta software. Now Ramírez has announced that he <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/journelly-open-for-beta">has an official beta program running that you can sign up for</a>. If it seems like something that would be useful for you, you should sign up for the beta and give it a try.

Ramírez says that the app doesn&rsquo;t (yet) support entering items orally but notes that you can use the system dictation facility for this. My reaction when I saw that was, &ldquo;Duh. Of course.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening in Notes. I&rsquo;ve never programmed in the iOS environment so I&rsquo;m pretty much a luser where it&rsquo;s concerned and don&rsquo;t have a good mental picture of what&rsquo;s happening under the covers.

I&rsquo;m not ready to commit to adopting Journelly for my memo book because it&rsquo;s an important part of my workflow but I do think I&rsquo;ll sign up for the beta and at least play around with it. If it <i>is</i> as good as it looks, I&rsquo;ll probably use it seriously as soon as there is an official release.</p>
