<p>In the latest development in efforts to end the Russia‑Ukraine war, the United States and Ukraine have sharply revised a US-drafted peace framework in talks in Geneva and Abu Dhabi, cutting it from 28 points to about 19 and removing several of Moscow’s most far‑reaching demands that Kyiv and European allies had rejected. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says many “correct” elements are now included and that the plan has become “doable,” but he insists that sensitive issues such as territorial control and long‑term security guarantees still need to be discussed directly with President Trump. While US officials describe the weekend talks as “highly productive,” European leaders warn that no quick deal is in sight and have pushed their own counter‑proposals to avoid what they see as excessive concessions to Russia. At the same time, Russia has welcomed parts of the original US proposal and signalled it expects any final agreement to start from that more favorable version, underscoring a wide gap between the positions of Kyiv, its Western partners and Moscow. Even as negotiators talk, Russia and Ukraine have exchanged heavy missile and drone barrages that killed people in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy and Russia’s Rostov region, a grim reminder that the war continues on the ground while diplomacy inches forward.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/-Cir1cQJJgEaj8Q3kCXY9A4U5_BB6N7R0-52NRzvBJnvrysEYs9k_rSynr_mqVVdbzVmd9RnrRn9YNPvIUMPcMIfeolSMsmEFGoDa66exal6uaO7TUJmv6t9zLaACiYx66rYKNV1boTJxC7tYuxA7Sa00XvyHVm0geN39RnxOfjAksa7Yj9cdjpuGUBFydU0pyS-xv4SnnnDIhIUi2jFjYLNTq_uCA' alt='Emergency workers respond after a Russian strike hit a residential building in western Ukraine amid intensified diplomacy over a US peace proposal.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Plan’s key changes: Officials say the revised framework no longer explicitly requires Ukraine to cede the entire Donbas region, trims the text from 28 to around 19 points, and adjusts language on Ukraine’s future military size and Western security ties, leaving the most sensitive territorial and NATO‑related questions for direct talks between President Trump and President Zelensky.</li><li>Trump administration’s role: President Trump publicly hailed that “something good just may be happening” as his team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, has spent roughly ten months shuttling between Kyiv, Geneva and now Abu Dhabi to promote a ceasefire blueprint and gather feedback from all sides.</li><li>European security concerns: European Union and UK officials, initially excluded from the 28‑point draft, now participate in the talks and have warned that any cap on Ukraine’s armed forces or de facto recognition of Russian‑held territory could undermine Europe’s own security architecture and encourage further aggression.</li><li>Russian position: The Kremlin describes many elements of the original US proposal as acceptable and says President Putin views it as a possible basis for a final settlement, while a senior adviser has dismissed Europe’s alternative plan as not fitting Russia “constructively” and nationalist commentators argue that anything short of full Ukrainian capitulation would be unacceptable.</li><li>Battlefield backdrop: As diplomats negotiate, Russia has fired dozens of missiles, including Kinzhal hypersonic weapons, and hundreds of drones at Ukraine’s capital and energy system, while Ukrainian forces have struck Russia’s Rostov region, leading to blackouts, damaged residential buildings and more than a dozen deaths and numerous injuries on both sides since the Geneva talks concluded.</li></ul><blockquote>As of now, after Geneva, there are fewer points, no longer 28, and many correct elements have been incorporated into this framework. - Volodymyr Zelensky</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Ukraine: President Zelensky says the amended framework has become more acceptable for Kyiv but stresses that Ukraine cannot agree to a plan that effectively lets Russia keep territory it has seized and that “sensitive” points must be thrashed out directly with President Trump..
