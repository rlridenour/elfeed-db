<p>Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) administrators cancelled &#8220;Ethics in Public Policy,&#8221; a graduate course in the university&#8217;s Bush School of Government and Public Service, because they rejected as too vague its professor&#8217;s explanation of when and how race and gender issues may come up in the course.<span id="more-56237"></span></p>
<p>First <a href="https://dailynous.com/2026/01/06/texas-am-bans-plato/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plato</a>, now ethics.</p>
<p>Is there some kind of &#8220;achievements in irony&#8221; award this university is gunning for?</p>
<p>Interviewed by <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2026/01/15/texas-am-course-canceled-race-gender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Texas Tribune</em></a>, the course&#8217;s instructor, Professor <a href="https://bush.tamu.edu/faculty/lbright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leonard Bright</a>, said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“I told them it was going to come up every day,” Bright said. “During discussions, book reviews, case studies, throughout the course. There is no one day. That’s how this class works.”</em></p>
<p>The Dean of the Bush School, <a href="https://bush.tamu.edu/deanscorner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Sherman</a> (like TAMU&#8217;s president <a href="https://dailynous.com/2026/01/13/a-dishonest-response-from-tamu-president-tommy-williams/">Tommy Williams</a>, not an academic), announced the cancelled class in an email to faculty, and the students were notified in an email from Lori L. Taylor, Head of the the Department of Public Service and Administration in which she blames Professor Bright for the cancellation, saying he declined &#8220;the opportunity to clarify the syllabus&#8221;:</p>

<p>According to Bright, what Sherman said is false. Rather, it seems, Sherman did not accept that the clarification of when and how gender and race would be discussed was something like the very normal and honest:<em> regularly, in a variety of ways, throughout the course</em>.</p>
<p>Bright posted the following email he had sent to Sherman about the course:</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G-pA_0vakAATucD?format=png&amp;name=900x900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email</a> to all Bush School faculty, Dean Sherman wrote that he had sent the university&#8217;s Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, <a href="https://provost.tamu.edu/directory/profiles/michael-johnson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Johnson</a>, several syllabi to see if they would require special approval (an &#8220;exemption&#8221;), given their content. Professor Bright&#8217;s was among them, and came back flagged as needing that approval. Here is an excerpt from Sherman&#8217;s email:</p>

<p>Sherman writes that &#8220;transparency does not equal censorship.&#8221; That is true. But censorship is not the only form that violations of academic freedom can take. In a context in which <a href="https://dailynous.com/2026/01/06/texas-am-bans-plato/">transparency has recently resulted in censorship</a>, it is not unreasonable to treat requests for transparency&#8212;requests which demand ridiculously, perhaps disingenuously, precise answers about recently censored topics&#8212;as violations of academic freedom.</p>
<p>Bright&#8217;s course was <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2026/01/15/texas-am-course-canceled-race-gender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> the only ethics course on offer at the entire school of public policy this term.</p>

<p>* Yes, this is a long headline. I hope it satisfies <a href="https://dailynous.com/2026/01/13/a-dishonest-response-from-tamu-president-tommy-williams/">my critics</a>.</p>
<p>Correction: the first email was mistakenly attributed to John Sherman; the post has now been corrected to indicate that the email to students was sent by Lori Taylor.</p>
