Our ultimate guide includes all of our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> coverage, and it is a useful resource for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users who haven't had a chance to test out &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, or those who might want a recap on what's new. We've organized it by app or feature to make it easy to find what you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="liquid_glass">Liquid Glass</h2><br/>
Apple's Liquid Glass design brings a big visual change to &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. Icons, apps, menu bars, navigation bars, and all other interface elements feature a Liquid Glass aesthetic. It's not just translucency that you have to deal with. There are pop out menus, collapsing navigation bars, and a much more rounded aesthetic.<br/>
