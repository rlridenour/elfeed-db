<p>Coffee time.
I woke up wondering about <code>.org-id-locations</code>. You know, that Emacs file that keeps track of all of your org-mode IDs. How does it know where are the headers in the files it refers to? Is there a size limit? Can I use a different file (or files) if I want to for the hell of it?</p>
<p>What?? Don&rsquo;t look at me like that. I often think about Emacs just before I fall asleep and when I wake up. Don&rsquo;t you?</p>
