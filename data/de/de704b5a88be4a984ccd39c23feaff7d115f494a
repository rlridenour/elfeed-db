<p>In the latest development in the Israel–Gaza war, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza reports that more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023, after adding hundreds of newly identified victims and the latest strike casualties to its tally. Officials say recent additions include people killed in earlier stages of the war whose remains were recovered from destroyed buildings, as well as several people reported killed in Israeli attacks this week. The ministry states that over 300 Palestinians have died since a ceasefire took effect on 10 October this year, as Israel continues to carry out limited strikes it says respond to truce violations, while Palestinian reports describe repeated shelling, air raids and sniper fire. Much of Gaza remains in ruins, making it difficult for local authorities to compile accurate casualty data, and Israel has questioned the ministry’s figures but has not released its own overall death estimate for the territory.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Pchsorky4EFRmw7I7DVmyuJKqV76sMcEQ4ikH70R9yZzHlY_z6WquZrMurgCcCZU-22VoTV_nd4S2q4hjPq887qT0fmXa8z9iaVoTLkmysW1xyUyTYknjz7HefedP13Rzg5gvzMHRu1_3HvcmCXpKxL4s71nqqesX0S0c7ZSuf0laAJSkVJYEUuVH1z5g7RcRRpxGdS4uhPpOCjPcEtpbXQEzghlpO-EDzHi' alt='Residents walk past damaged buildings in Gaza amid ongoing devastation from the Israel–Hamas war.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ceasefire violations: Palestinian news agency WAFA reported Israeli helicopter fire and artillery shelling near the Al-Bureij refugee camp, Bani Suheila and areas east of Rafah after the October ceasefire, while Israel continues to accuse Hamas of truce breaches.</li><li>Children among victims: A hospital in southern Gaza reported that Israeli fire killed two young Palestinian brothers in the area after the latest ceasefire, adding to the rising post-truce casualty figures.</li><li>Method of counting: Gaza’s health authorities initially relied on hospital records with names and ID numbers, then later delayed adding thousands of reported deaths until forensic, medical and legal checks could be completed amid the territory’s devastated infrastructure.</li><li>Post-truce body recovery: Since the October ceasefire, civil defense teams have used the relative lull in large-scale bombing to retrieve remains buried under rubble, prompting steady upward revisions of the official death count.</li><li>Entire families lost: Individual testimonies describe large-scale family losses, including a man near Bureij camp who said Israeli airstrikes on two residential buildings killed 62 of his relatives, among them his parents and four siblings.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Gaza health ministry: The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says its casualty figures are based on a combination of hospital records and verified reports from emergency teams, and that it continues to update the tally as more remains are recovered from destroyed areas..
