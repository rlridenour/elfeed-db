</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Feeling in a bit of a rut, I again consult my oracle and spend an evening in reflection.
</p>
        <p>I’ve been reading more, but am in a bit of a lull (as in only 45 minutes of
reading each of the last 4 days).  And I’m not quite feeling like writing
either.  As though I’m missing something.</p>
<p>So I pull a random quote from amongst those I’ve collected, as though consulting
the oracle:</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="constantly-bound-by-craving-and-fear-to-a-future-full-of-uncertainties">
<p>
Constantly bound by craving and fear to a future full of uncertainties, we strip
each present moment of its calm, its intrinsic import, which we are unable to
enjoy.  And so, the future destroys the present.
</p>
<footer>&#8213; Hannah Arendt</footer></blockquote>
<p>Craving and fear as binding agents.  Fear, I can immediately see.  I know that
is the diet proposed since before I was born.  But craving?  That I wrestle for
a bit.  What is the source of that?  Is it worry?  Fixation?  Needing to prepare
for that uncertainty?  A general fear of death?</p>
<p>I must remember to fixate less on the future, less hedging and more being and
doing.  I find myself reading, though wonder if I am deferring action instead?
What does action look like in this low population density area we call home?</p>
<p>It’s clear, to me, that my presence often brings an invigoration to gatherings;
or perhaps it is I whom feels invigorated and I project?  How could I even go
about testing that?  Would it reveal more than I already know?</p>
<p>Looking beyond myself, it is hard to imagine present calm moments for others.
As <abbr title="Immigration and Customs Enforcement">ICE</abbr> receives a massive boost in funding, where is the calm?  As torture,
extra-judicial rendition, and corruption run amok, stuffing the state with those
not interested in governing; but looting, where is the calm?  All of that moment
craving what could be.</p>
<p>I know I crave a time both now and in the future, in which not all things are
circling toward the demagogue event horizon.  Imagine how it will feel when
we’re no longer locked in the voracity of ever enclosing politicalization.  That
outrage machine, ever hungry and depraved.  Worried not of truth nor knowledge,
but of being superior by whatever logic they must twist.</p>
<p>Yet here beside me a dog sleeps.  Her paws drooping over the edge of the couch;
now flapping just a bit as she runs through her dreams.  Cicadas crackle and
crickets strum an overtone, here is calm.  As the evening skies cedes to
the cover of night, here is calm.</p>
<p>Dogs, now they know joy.  When they see us returned from an outing that left
them home.  Or of my walking to the shelf where we keep the frisbees.  Or of
pulling my swim trunks down from the line and starting to disrobe.  They know
joy in moments.  Of play and motion.  I wonder who might I see come through a
proverbial door that might bring such joy?  Or what might they offer to set me
aflame in the present moment.</p>
<p>As I write, I pick up the smell of wood smoke.  Is this carried from the boreal
forest fires up north?  No, from neighbors a few house down.  It is a campfire
of a family gathering to celebrate one of their own’s 70th birthday.  Yet that
smell reminding me that it is around the campfires in which I feel most
connected to the people with me and the world at large.  And never worried
craving nor fixating on the future, only wondering how those evenings might last
longer.</p>
<p>The wood smoke also transports me back to <cite data-id="fee4ffa7-1d45-46e7-86f1-af203b92f54b">Aflame</cite> by Pico Iyer.  A yearning for solitude, something that I will have for a few days
as Jenny heads to Chicago.  Is simplicity required for solitude?  What of books?
Pen and paper?  Do those visiting the retreats all bring books?  Is stepping out
of my home required to feel that liberating solitude?  Or can I conjure this at
home, even as the laundry asks to get done?</p>
<p>And of those books, the humble monastery had a bookstore, which helped fund
their operations.  Are these books, an often solitary activity, a meditation and
communion with others?  Does soul see soul?  Of those whom engaged in the
solitary act of writing.  Do those seeking solitude find kindred amongst other
authors; certainly not all authors.  But there are a plenty for us to bond with.</p>
<p>This is the second time I’ve pull quotes from the collection—the first being <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/07/30/a-game-played-with-a-pile-of-random-quotes/">A
Game Played with a Pile of Random Quotes</a>.  And each time I’ve found renewal,
through reflecting on a phrase I once found important enough to ensnare.  If the
present is enemy of the future, then perhaps the future shall lean on the past
to remind me of what was and very much still is.</p>
