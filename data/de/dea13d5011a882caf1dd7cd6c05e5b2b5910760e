Back in the 1980s <a href="https://archive.org/details/unix-magic-poster-gary-overcare-1">Gary Overcare&rsquo;s Unix Magic poster</a> was a popular item at USENIX conferences. It depicts a Unix Wizard casting his spells in a giant shell surrounded by various Unix paraphernalia.

The meanings of the various parts of the poster have always been a bit mysterious but now David Rio has released <a href="https://unixmagic.net/#poster-info">an interactive annotated version of the poster</a>. You can click on one of the items and get Rio&rsquo;s explanation of what it is and what it means. These are Rio&rsquo;s explanations not Overcare&rsquo;s so we can&rsquo;t consider them definitive but by and large they seem reasonable to me.
