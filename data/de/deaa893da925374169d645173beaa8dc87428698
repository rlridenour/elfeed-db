<blockquote>
  <p>The Razr+ 2024 model measures 3.46 inches tall, but still has a
4-inch diagonal screen size. For comparison, the smallest modern
(2021) iPhone is the 13 mini, and that one is 5.18 inches tall.
The Razr foldable is a legitimately small phone that can easily be
held in one hand. It slips into a front pocket. It’s 0.60 inches
thick. That might sound bulky, but in practice, it isn’t any
bigger than using an iPhone with a case on it.</p>

<p>For anyone unfamiliar with this style of folding phone, the front
screen isn’t just a novelty. It’s completely usable in the same
way the larger internal screen is. By the way, the full-sized
screen opens up to 6.9 inches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remain completely dubious of this form factor. Hayes compares the naked folded Razr+ to an iPhone in case, thickness-wise, but one of the problems inherent to this form factor is that most people adhere to a religious belief that they somehow need to put their phone in a case. <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/family/all-cases-and-protection">They sell cases</a> for these flip-style foldables but that just makes them even thicker. Comparing an un-cased foldable to an encased regular phone is bogus.</p>

<p>Worse, I dispute the notion that these phones are “completely usable” from the front screen alone. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/654846/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-specs-screen-price">Reviews</a> of these phones, including Hayes’s, tend to avoid including photographs of what they look like when the on-screen keyboard is showing. The keyboard <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/razr-keyboard-front.jpeg">basically takes up the entire screen</a> (<a href="https://youtu.be/AZl36e1LEAw?t=54">source</a>), <em>and</em> it’s awkwardly positioned an inch from the bottom, to sit above the camera lenses. Technically usable, but no one is going to type more than a few words like this. If you have to unfold the phone just to text or email, why not buy a phone that doesn’t fold at all?</p>

<p>Book-style foldables seem like a maybe to me. Flip-style foldables just seem dumb. And the only “perfect solution” for anyone who wants a smaller phone would be for Apple to bring back the Mini size.</p>
