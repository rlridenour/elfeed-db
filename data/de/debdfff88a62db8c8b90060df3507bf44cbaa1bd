In January, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that Apple was aiming to release a new HomePod mini "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/">toward the end of the year</a>." If that timeframe remains accurate, the HomePod mini 2 will likely be released in September, October, or November this year.<br/>
<br/>
The new HomePod mini will be equipped with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a>, according to Gurman. He said the chip will support Wi-Fi 6E, which is much faster and has lower latency compared to the current HomePod mini's Wi-Fi 4.<br/>
<br/>
No other features or changes have been rumored yet, but improved sound quality and a newer processor are safe bets. The current HomePod mini is equipped with the Apple Watch Series 5's S5 chip from 2019. The speaker could also be updated with Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, which debuted in iPhone 15 models.<br/>
