<p>&#8220;Whenever I see people engaged in philosophical debate or argument, I want to see people trying to <i>win.</i> I like my philosophy adversarial, aggressive, combative, and even hostile. I think there are some good reasons for this approach&#8230; but I also think it’s more fun that way. <span id="more-55360"></span>And I’m not the only one. Friedrich Nietzsche once said one of the reasons Socrates was so popular among the high-born youth of Athens was that he introduced them to a new kind of competitive wrestling.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why not? For one thing, he doesn&#8217;t like &#8220;loyalty oaths&#8221;:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Heterodox Academy (hereinafter, HxA) is an academic advocacy group devoted to promoting open inquiry, viewpoint diversity, and constructive disagreement in research and education&#8230; If you aspire to team up with notable heroes of the campus free speech movement and declare that you too are HxA, you must go online, click a box, and thereby affirm the following statement. “I support open inquiry, viewpoint diversity, and constructive disagreement”. In other words, you need to take a loyalty oath. </em></p>
<p>But he also thinks this particular loyalty oath has a problem:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The problem is that “constructive disagreement”, as HxA understands and advocates for it, is inconsistent with open inquiry and undermines viewpoint diversity. That makes the HxA loyalty oath logically self-contradictory and the act of requiring people to take it self-defeating.</em></p>
<p>What does HxA mean by &#8220;constructive disagreement&#8221;? Veber shares the following, from the organization&#8217;s website:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The objective of most intellectual exchanges should not be to “win,” but rather to have all parties come away from an encounter with a deeper understanding of our social, aesthetic, and natural worlds. Try to imagine ways of integrating strong parts of an interlocutor’s positions into one’s own. Don’t just criticize, consider viable positive alternatives. Try to work out new possibilities, or practical steps that could be taken to address the problems under consideration. The corollary to this guidance is to avoid sarcasm, contempt, hostility, and snark. Generally target ideas rather than people. Do not attribute negative motives to people you disagree with as an attempt at dismissing or discrediting their views. Avoid hyperbole when describing perceived problems or (especially) one’s adversaries&#8212;for instance, do not analogize people to Stalin, Hitler/the Nazis, Mao, the antagonists of 1984, etc.</em></p>
<p>As noted above, Veber likes seeing philosophers who are out to win. But he also objects to the prohibitions on tone and to that &#8220;etc.&#8221; at the end, indicating &#8220;an open ended, and therefore infinite, and therefore infinitely abusable list of prohibited words and phrases.&#8221;</p>
<p>He objects to HxA Community Moderation Policy, which states, in part, that &#8220;<i>Ad hominem</i> attacks and threats will not be tolerated.&#8221; About this, Veber writes: &#8220;Ad hominem arguments are fallacious only when they are failures of relevance. And sometimes they’re not. [And] since relevance is highly contextual and itself subject to disagreement, sometimes it can be hard to tell whether a given ad hominem is fallacious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Veber opposes HxA&#8217;s injunction to &#8220;always try to engage with the strongest form of a position one disagrees with (that is, &#8216;steel-man&#8217; opponents rather than &#8216;straw-manning&#8217; them)&#8221;:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I reject this also. If you disagree with me, I’d prefer you engage with what I actually said. To straw-man me is to distort what I said to make it easier to refute. But you can also distort by steel-manning. To say you should </em>always <em>steel-man me is to say everything I say should be filtered through your own opinion of what I should have said. But what I think and what you think I should think may be two very different things&#8212;especially if we are in a fundamental disagreement over some important matter. In a case like that, to steel-man is to paternalistically change the subject. And maybe you’re the one who’s out to lunch. So why not just listen to what I said and go after that? If I think I’m being mischaracterized, I can say so. If you think there’s a better view in the neighborhood of mine, you can tell me that and I can take it or leave it. And if you prefer to just criticize, I say go for it.</em></p>
