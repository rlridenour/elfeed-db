<p>My <a href="https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/zsa-voyager/">ZSA Voyager</a> keyboard has a new travelling companion: a <a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager/navigator">ZSA Navigator</a>. I love using it, but it has taken a bit of time to figure out the best configuration for me.</p>

<p>When I saw that ZSA had made an add-on trackball unit for the Voyager, I was immediately interested. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed a trackball, and had a Logitech thumb trackball mouse (I guess you would call it?) for several years. Finding a good spot to put a separate mouse, trackpad or trackball is always tricky with a split keyboard. If you put it to the right (or left, if left-handed) of the halves of the board, you can end up with shoulder pain from having to rotate your arm away from the midline. If you put it in between the halves, your wrist can end up at an awkward angle, or &mdash; if using a mouse rather than trackball or trackpad &mdash; you have limited room for manoeuvre. It also means that the distance between the halves is partially determined by needing to accommodate your pointing device of choice, rather than what is most comfortable for your arms and shoulders.</p>
<p>So I thought about it for a while. Using the Voyager has been a fantastic experience, and everything I have bought from ZSA has had excellent build quality, but I wondered whether I <em>needed</em> the Navigator, or just <em>wanted</em> it. It&rsquo;s not cheap, but then good quality mice are not cheap these days. However, as with many of ZSA&rsquo;s products, Navigator&rsquo;s design is open to home-customisation by 3D printing a new &lsquo;shell&rsquo; with <code>.stl</code> files ZSA provides (to hold the Core which has the sensors and connections), and it can integrate with standard QMK firmware to enable you to use it on other boards. As I explained in my review of the Voyager, this is something I really value about ZSA&rsquo;s products. They make great hardware, but they also enable and encourage you to customise it to your needs. While I certainly don&rsquo;t intend to switch away from the Voyager any time soon (if ever, it&rsquo;s a daily pleasure to use it), knowing that you are not locked in should things change is reassuring.</p>
<p>So, I took the plunge and ordered one. They offer one for left and right hand use. The shape of the shell differs between the two because it hugs the inner edge of the respective keyboard half which is obviously mirrored. This means you need to specify which variant you would like when you order. I had to think about this for a surprisingly long time. I am right-handed, but use my left hand habitually some things (like brushing my teeth). I normally use a trackball, mouse or trackpad with my right hand, but for some reason, my gut instinct was telling me that I might prefer to roll the trackball with my left and use my right to click the &lsquo;mouse button&rsquo; keys. In the end, I went for the right-handed version, and I think that was definitely the correct choice.</p>
<p>A work trip to Indonesia came between me receiving the Navigator and being able to try it out, but it gave me a nice thing to look forward to after the trip. As ever, the quality is great. It comes in a small padded and zipped carry case that will hold the unit and cables comfortably. Red is one of my favourite colours, so the deep red, slightly glittery ball gets a big tick from me. The shell holds the Core (in which the ball sits), and has concealed sockets for the TRRS cables: one short one that connects to the right half (in the right-handed version), and a longer one that connects to the left half of the keyboard. They provide new, nicely braided TRRS cables of suitable lengths, which have a straight connector on the Navigator end, and a 90° one for the keyboard end. The shell attaches to the keyboard half using ZSA&rsquo;s trademark ferociously strong magnets. I find I need to hold my palm over the trackball when attaching it, as otherwise the magnetic attraction clunks the halves together so forcefully and quickly that the ball can get popped out of the core. The shell doesn&rsquo;t interfere at all with the tenting feet if you use them, but it does raise the right half very slightly higher than the left if you don&rsquo;t use the tenting feet. Either way, the unit is really solidly locked on there, but &mdash; as they point out in the information &mdash; the trackball rests in the Core through gravity alone, so if you tent the halves at a steep angle, it may fall out.</p>
<p>Once you have the hardware connected up, you need to configure the unit in the Oryx configurator, and then flash the new firmware. It automatically provides a mouse layer for you, but you can edit this or delete it and create your own if you want. Either way, you need to set up mouse click keys, and a &lsquo;Drag Scroll&rsquo; key which you hold down while rolling the trackball to scroll (vertically or horizontally). You can also set the Navigator up to automatically activate your mouse layer when the trackball is moved, and deactivate some time later, with both timings being configurable.</p>
<p>This is the way I set it up initially. However, I found that I was pausing for too long after positioning the cursor before clicking, so the layer deactivated. If I lengthened the deactivation timeout, I was clicking things instead of typing. I therefore switched to manually activating my mouse layer by holding down a key, which worked much better for me. Finding the right position for that key took some time, because it needed to be easy for me to hold for as long as I wanted to move the cursor around, click or scroll, but also enable me to use the mouse click buttons in a way that felt natural.</p>
<p>Around this time, as I was changing and re-flashing my configuration frequently, I started to get issues of not being able to disable the automatic activation (which you do by choosing &lsquo;clear&rsquo; from the layer choice menu in the Navigator pop up). I also occasionally had situations (more often on macOS than Linux) where the mouse layer would &lsquo;stick&rsquo; on after I had released the manual layer key for it, and I would have to plug and unplug the USB cable to reset it.</p>
<p>At this point, I contacted ZSA support. I haven&rsquo;t had any need previously to contact them, but they were terrific, giving me clear instructions for things to try, as well as specific advice about my configuration. It turned out that something in the browser cache was to blame, and clearing that sorted out all my issues. Even better, Robin suggested that I might like to try out a new feature they had just added, which enables you to exit the mouse layer automatically when tapping any other key not specifically defined in the mouse layer map. This means that you can set the automatic activation on, with deactivation at its shortest timeout (1 ms), but you will immediately drop out of the mouse layer as soon as you do anything other than hit click or scroll keys.</p>
<p>This. Is. Amazing 🪄.</p>
<p>If you have a Navigator and don&rsquo;t have this setting enabled, I am very confident that you will love it if you try it. Essentially, the experience of using the Navigator went from enjoyable but requiring more mental and physical effort than I would like (trying to co-ordinate holds and clicks, for example) to almost completely transparent and effortless. It just does what you want. I move my right index finger to the trackball and find the spot I want then my left index finger clicks, or my left thumb resting on the outer thumb key holds while I scroll. As soon as I do anything else with the keyboard, I&rsquo;m automatically switched out of mouse mode. By the way, horizontal scrolling becomes really easy, as you hold the same drag scroll key, but just move the ball horizontally rather than vertically. The trackball&rsquo;s motion is very smooth, and a gentle flick will spin it for quite a while, so you can scroll fast to the top or bottom of a long page.</p>

</div>
<p>I also have middle and right clicks set up on the middle row (all are horizontally mirrored from their natural positions though, so that my strongest index finger is on the left click which I use the most), and on the bottom row I have set up click + modifier keys. That&rsquo;s useful if I need to <code>Cmd/Ctrl+click</code> or <code>Shift+click</code> something, and is easy to remember as it matches my usual modifier locations.</p>
<p>It might not be for everyone, but the Navigator feels like a complete and integrated keyboarding experience. Note that if you use drawing programmes, CAD or anything like that which requires precision mousing, you will probably still need a mouse for those purposes, but then standard trackballs or trackpads are also not well suited to those use-cases either. For everything else, it is a wonderful experience. It also &mdash; and this is obviously the most important selling point &mdash; frees up the critical &lsquo;between the halves&rsquo; real estate for the use of one&rsquo;s elderly cat.</p>
