Ediff is a thing of beauty. It provides a way of not only seeing the difference between two files but for merging various differences into a third combined file. It&rsquo;s very powerful and flexible. The problem is that using it can seem extraordinary complex. There&rsquo;s a command menu that may or may not appear in your current frame but even if it does there are a plethora of options most of which are unfathomably opaque.

Charles Choi is once again <a href="http://yummymelon.com/devnull/announcing-casual-ediff.html">easing our pain by providing a transient menu that tries to bring sanity to the confusion</a>. His new package, casual ediff, tries to cut through the confusion. Take a look at his post to see causal ediff in action.

Ediff is really powerful and every Emacs user should be able to use it. Choi&rsquo;s casual ediff can help with that but as I <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=11780">learned</a> from <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2023-11-17-emacs-ediff-basics/">this video from Prot</a>, you can ignore most of the complexity of ediff. There are really only a very commands that you need to know. As I said in my post about Prot&rsquo;s video:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
All you really need to know is n for the next diff, p for the previous diff, and a, b, or c to move the A, B, or C diff to the other buffer(s). That’s it. It covers almost everything you ever really want to do in Ediff.

If you&rsquo;re casual suite user, by all means include casual ediff in your repertoire but if you&rsquo;re not and just want to make using ediff as simple as possible, take a look at Prot&rsquo;s video.</p>
