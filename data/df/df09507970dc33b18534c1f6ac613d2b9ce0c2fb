<p>Feels like this vacation ended before it even started. We still have some time to spend tomorrow, and we&rsquo;re planning on pizza<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> at some point before we head back.</p>
<p>It took me too long to stop thinking of work. I haven&rsquo;t realized how deep I&rsquo;m in. It helps to have this understanding though. As always, I&rsquo;m glad to be going back home to my little cave, where Hedwig the second - my Pop OS desktop - is waiting with my games, after <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/06/30/my-latest-gpu-issues-updates.html">the latest issue</a> seems to be resolved.</p>
<p>Turns out I can take pretty good photos 📷 with the iPhone. I know, not a huge shock there. In the past, I used my camera for &ldquo;the serious&rdquo; stuff; this time, all the photos you see from the last couple of days on the blog are taken with my phone. I only took a couple with the camera that ran out of battery quickly. Considering the ease of use of syncing these&hellip; well, we will see.</p>
