<p>Portugal has elected centre-left Socialist António José Seguro as its next president in a second-round runoff held Sunday. Multiple outlets described a decisive, roughly two-to-one victory over far-right challenger André Ventura. Seguro will serve a five-year term, succeeding outgoing president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who is stepping down after two terms. Many framed the result as a choice for a familiar, moderate figure after a campaign in which Ventura and his Chega party pushed an anti-establishment, nationalist message. Seguro also drew support from some conservative figures who wanted to prevent a Chega win. Even in defeat, Ventura’s record runoff share underscored a shift in Portugal—long seen as an outlier in Europe’s far-right surge—toward a more polarized political landscape. Storms complicated voting logistics in parts of the country, but turnout was said to be roughly in line with the first round—evidence of strong participation despite difficult conditions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/bzWom8aO21JiHijnMs53mA8H_zFtNVVhJTh2DFljduM7EQca3lHFf6JY4qZsPPeKNiPlEh_j39-APP4pVDvkKDXTyNtIw2G5yHXnWoM8O9z8bO10Ctak8irTOB0djH-jehhEEHAzLLLADEeklQtnQbOUMpqX5Hgpm1uyZ-fKvzfBlGWGAkbdZ_yRsbKGjmhHn8RrOEOGF_T_PqW79kc2sZYFj_29XJKPQtvztgs-2o0fdmW7ls893En6L3pp4ugKh7mkxP0bf1iOHA' alt='Socialist António José Seguro after the presidential results announcement in Caldas da Rainha, Portugal, on February 8, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Vote totals: With more than 99% counted, Seguro led with 66.8% to Ventura’s 33.2%, according to results cited by multiple outlets.</li><li>Chega’s best showing yet: Ventura lost, but his result was described as the strongest presidential performance so far for the populist Chega movement.</li><li>A first in years: Seguro becomes Portugal’s first Socialist head of state in about 20 years, after conservative Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa’s two terms.</li><li>Momentum for Ventura: Le Monde said Ventura won more votes than Chega did in the May 2025 parliamentary elections, cementing him as a key political figure despite the defeat.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>António José Seguro’s backers: Reports described a cross-party effort after the first round, including support from some senior conservative figures, to help Seguro defeat Ventura in the runoff.
