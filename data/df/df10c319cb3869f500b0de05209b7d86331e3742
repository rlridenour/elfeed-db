<p>Foo Yun Chee, reporting for Reuters under the headline “Exclusive: Apple Set to Stave Off EU Fine Into Browser Options, Sources Say”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is set to stave off a possible fine and an EU order over its
browser options on iPhones after it made changes to comply with
landmark EU rules aimed at reining in Big Tech, people with direct
knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday. The European Commission,
which launched an investigation in March last year under the
Digital Markets Act (DMA), is expected to close its investigation
early next week, the people said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A win’s a win and a closed investigation’s a closed investigation, but the browser choice screen never seemed like a problem for Apple. I follow this stuff closely, and have even written (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_ios_continental_drift_widens">at times extensively</a>) about how <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/firefox-ios-doubling-france-and-germany">dumb and ineffective</a> these mandatory browser choice screens are, and I didn’t realize this investigation was still open, because it seemed so clear Apple had done what they needed to for compliance.</p>

<p>So, more interesting to me is this bit buried lower in the article, suggesting the EC is going to fine Apple next week over non-compliance with the DMA’s anti-steering provisions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Commission’s decision to close the investigation early next
week will come at the same time as it hands out fines to Apple and
Meta Platforms for DMA violations and orders to comply with the
legislation, the people said.</p>

<p>In this second Apple case, the issue is whether the company
imposes restrictions that hinder app developers from informing
users about offers outside its App Store free of charge.</p>
