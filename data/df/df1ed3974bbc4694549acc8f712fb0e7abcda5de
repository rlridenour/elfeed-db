Kiran Gopinathan has a very interesting video on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1niy3hk/how_i_read_papers_with_orgroam_zotero_emacs/">how she uses Emacs, Org-Roam, and Zotero to do her literature reviews</a>. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with the concept, <i>Literature Reviews</i> are the process of reading papers related to your current research topic. Typically there are a lot of papers and you have to take notes as you go along so that you can draw it all together for your own research and papers.

Her video serves as a real life example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> in action. A she reads a paper, she takes notes and, critically, links them to the other papers she&rsquo;s read on the current topic. Her workflow involves storing the papers in <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> and automatically updating her BibTeX file as new papers are introduced.

You can see Gopinathan&rsquo;s method in action in her video. Things move along fairly rapidly and can difficult to follow so you have to beardown when watching it but it&rsquo;s worth the effort. Even if you&rsquo;re not an academic, it&rsquo;s easy to see how the process could be useful for organizing your own data.

Although she doesn&rsquo;t mention it in the video, her Org-Roam configuration is available online <a href="https://gist.github.com/kiranandcode/7216310a6b7989afb30f12f17f058123">in this Gist</a>. Take a look at it if you&rsquo;re interested in her method. The video is 16 minutes, 6 seconds long so it should be fairly easy to fit into your day. On the other hand, you may want to watch it more than once to wring out all the information it contains.</p>
