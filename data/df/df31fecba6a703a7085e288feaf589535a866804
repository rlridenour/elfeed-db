<p>Russia says its forces have taken full control of the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk region after months of heavy fighting, with President Vladimir Putin calling the reported advance an important step toward Moscow&#x27;s broader military objectives. Ukraine has either not immediately commented or has insisted it still holds part of the city, dismissing Moscow&#x27;s announcements as premature and characterising them as loud statements rather than confirmed facts on the ground. The reported seizure of Pokrovsk, a key logistics and transport hub for Ukrainian forces in the east, coincides with Russian claims that they have also taken the city of Vovchansk in Kharkiv region, underscoring pressure on multiple fronts. The announcement comes just as President Trump&#x27;s special peace envoy Steve Witkoff visits the region, holding talks with Ukrainian and US negotiators in Florida and preparing for a Kremlin meeting with President Putin on a potential framework to end the war, a sequence European and French officials describe as a crucial moment for Ukrainian diplomacy.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JbXBUo07Av8H7NXbGTVU9bsJWbB_J-iNI7NZunUeM4ehCkDGB9cBoVqBcbJm9UxNsH3q3weiFc3yEXZKA8muR4R7TJ19M86cLlLpOFaQQxDOPk4ebr_EYSmm4_p-qcfuL4Z8Ifwjk9-uFhPRzS__lEP_1AWzyl6TDHb95IwosgBR_qzIf8vqNw' alt='A view of damaged buildings and smoke rising in eastern Ukraine amid ongoing fighting around Pokrovsk.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Strategic importance: Pokrovsk serves as a significant rail and road junction in Donetsk, previously enabling Ukraine to move troops and supplies across the eastern front, which analysts say explains the prolonged and intense battles for the city.</li><li>Russian casualty costs: Russian forces endured months of fighting around Pokrovsk, with reports that the offensive involved thousands of Russian dead and wounded as they pushed toward the city’s urban centre.</li><li>Parallel offensive: Alongside the push on Pokrovsk, Russia’s Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov reported that Russian troops have also seized the border city of Vovchansk in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, broadening Moscow’s territorial claims beyond Donetsk.</li><li>US-Ukraine consultations: Before the envoy’s expected meeting with President Putin, Ukrainian representatives and US officials held discussions in Florida that both sides described as constructive, focusing on possible terms for a peace arrangement while acknowledging significant uncertainties remain.</li><li>European diplomatic push: EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said all actors are entering a crucial week for Ukraine’s diplomatic efforts, highlighting coordinated moves by European leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron’s meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris.</li></ul><blockquote>It would help Moscow fulfil its wider war aims - Vladimir Putin</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Russian government: President Vladimir Putin praised what commanders described as the complete capture of Pokrovsk, presenting the reported advance as an important victory that he says will support Russia’s broader objectives in the conflict.
