<p>A district court in Nara sentenced Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, to life in prison for killing Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, after Yamagami admitted the 2022 shooting during a campaign speech. The case left a deep mark on Japan because gun violence is rare there, and it raised wider questions about political security and public trust. Reporting across outlets says Yamagami told the court he acted out of anger at the Unification Church, blaming it for financial harm to his family and targeting Abe due to perceived links to church-connected groups.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Z6aCww_zslTyCFdo5-BlH3yHhBO-WZn8UbN8EMNeWZolpmRut9Qa0L6ZuVP9e-7zp415N7yPXkO4nRJl60_lNRoWmc92bcT-MzuTNGedhZG4R3j9AV_NHkw2Y5xCydhnpuD8m5x0JZqBby9d1X2klThYRIzHihEQFP5EkU62br7ekSdB3u2-ekQEltXPWoHJ' alt='Shinzo Abe campaigning in Nara in 2022 before he was shot.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Homemade weapon: Multiple outlets report Yamagami used a homemade gun in the attack, a detail that intensified scrutiny of how he prepared and approached the event.</li><li>Prosecutors’ stance: Prosecutors sought a life term and described the killing as an extremely grave event with broad societal consequences, according to coverage of the trial.</li><li>Political fallout: The shooting prompted investigations into ties between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Unification Church, with an internal party review finding more than 100 lawmakers had some form of connection.</li><li>Church consequences: RT reports that after the assassination, then-Prime Minister Fumio Kishida publicly moved to distance the LDP from the Unification Church, and a Tokyo court later ordered dissolution of the group’s Japanese branch.</li><li>Appeal possibility: Le Monde reports Yamagami’s defense team said it had not yet decided whether to appeal the life sentence.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prosecutors: They argued the crime’s seriousness and societal impact justified a life sentence request.
