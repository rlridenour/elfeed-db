https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/58j1ui/how_to_intercept_the_power_button_to_avoid_brutal/ Note that you might want suspend instead of hibernate, if you want rapid resume.
 The power button isn&rsquo;t handled by the window manager, it&rsquo;s handled by systemd
For example this is in my /etc/systemd/logind.conf
[Login] HandlePowerKey=hibernate HandleLidSwitch=ignore IdleAction=suspend IdleActionSec=20min
