<p>The Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) officially opens after more than two decades of planning and construction, unveiling a $1 billion complex next to the Giza pyramids that will display roughly 50,000 artefacts . The opening follows a long run of delays tied to political instability, the Covid-19 pandemic and regional conflicts, and is being pitched by Cairo as a centrepiece to revive tourism and bring in foreign currency for the cash‑strapped state . The GEM&#x27;s debut includes galleries and conservation facilities intended to modernize how Egypt preserves and presents its ancient civilizational heritage .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/dZ2NVkT14UiZEXfykNd6BEyexohJz5epI_w-YpGZTFJhYPGTxKvpXww0BuiavGaYlODb6Si6rTtltfRTy91kH1EQcCtrcFpd-f2T9AW56Wzyej1IZQR1mhrcO3bOonG1RU3kzuHoUkam3BgmAbA_8eaD0QTLN3EnPUrEYsvo-pLwRvGsBe_Ope6K7YbDZiTUPZLYLRDK-H2V_psykarQkxj5NyRftPghdmC8ZrQnKmE' alt='Exterior view of the Grand Egyptian Museum complex at the Giza plateau ahead of the official opening' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Scale: The complex covers about 470,000 square metres and is billed as the world&#x27;s largest archaeological facility dedicated to a single civilisation .</li><li>Conservation focus: The museum includes modern conservation and display spaces designed to centralize care for Egypt&#x27;s collections and improve long‑term preservation .</li><li>Hidden artefacts: Officials say some items in the GEM&#x27;s galleries have never before been publicly displayed, offering new material for researchers and visitors .</li><li>Delay causes: Project setbacks over the build included political instability, the Covid‑19 pandemic and regional conflicts that repeatedly pushed back opening plans .</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Egyptian government: The GEM is being promoted as a centrepiece of a national push to boost tourism and earn foreign currency for the economy.
