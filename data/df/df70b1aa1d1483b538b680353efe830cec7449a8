<p>We all know that checking three different calendar apps before agreeing to coffee with a friend is simply not fun. Or realizing mid-dentist appointment that you’re also supposed to be on a work call. Or playing calendar Tetris across multiple screens just to figure out when you can squeeze in that thing you actually <em>want</em> to do.</p><p>We’ve all been sold the idea that more is better — more apps, more tools, more ways to “organise our lives.” But when it comes to calendars, more usually means chaos.</p><p>Here’s the truth: you don’t need multiple calendars. You only need one place to see them all.</p><h2 id="the-calendar-multiplication-problem" tabindex="-1">The calendar multiplication problem</h2><p>Calendars are a reality. There’s your work calendar (probably Outlook or Google, because that’s what IT chose). Your personal Fastmail calendar. The shared family calendar where someone keeps scheduling things without asking. Maybe a volunteer committee calendar. Oh, and that sports league schedule that lives in yet another app.</p><p>Your reality — managing five separate windows into your life, and none of them talk to each other.</p><p>The mental math alone is exhausting. “Okay, I’m free at 2 pm on Tuesday… wait, no, that’s just in my work calendar. Let me check my personal… and the family one… actually, can I get back to you?”</p><h2 id="one-view-to-rule-them-all" tabindex="-1">One view to rule them all</h2><p>This is exactly why we partnered with Morgen. Because they get it: the problem isn’t that you have multiple calendars. The problem is looking at them separately.</p><p>Morgen lets you bring all your calendars together — your Fastmail calendar, your work calendar, even that random shared calendar from your book club — into one unified view. Suddenly, you’re not playing calendar detective anymore. You can actually <em>see</em> your life.</p><p>And here’s the best part: Morgen has the same values as Fastmail, and for this reason, treats your Fastmail calendar as a first-class citizen. No hacks, no workarounds, no “well, technically you could…”— just straightforward integration that actually works.</p><h2 id="time-blocking-the-adult-version-of-planning-your-day" tabindex="-1">‘Time Blocking’: The adult version of planning your day</h2><p>Remember when you used to plan out your day with a paper planner? Color-coding your classes, blocking out study time, actually having a sense of what you were doing when?</p><p>Time blocking is basically that, but for grown-ups with too many responsibilities.</p><p>The concept is simple: instead of letting your calendar fill up with whatever comes at you, you proactively block time for what matters. Focus work. Exercise. That project you keep saying you’ll get to. Time with actual humans you care about.</p><p>The problem? Time blocking only works if you can see your <em>entire</em> schedule. And that’s where most people give up — it’s too hard to coordinate across multiple calendars.</p><p>With Morgen and Fastmail, time blocking becomes ridiculously easy:</p><ul> <li><strong>Drag tasks straight onto your calendar</strong> instead of maintaining a separate to-do list, you’ll never look at</li> <li><strong>See all your commitments at once</strong> so you know what time you actually have available</li> <li><strong>Block out focus time</strong> that appears across all your calendars, so people stop booking meetings during your deep work hours</li> <li><strong>Balance the work-life thing</strong> by actually seeing both work and life in the same place</li> </ul><p>It’s not revolutionary. It’s just finally… possible.</p><h2 id="your-data-your-rules" tabindex="-1">Your data, your rules</h2><p>Here’s where it gets important: both Fastmail and Morgen are built on the simple idea that your data belongs to you. Not to advertisers. Not to data brokers. You.</p><p>When you connect your Fastmail account to Morgen, you’re using OAuth — which is tech-speak for “secure connection that respects your privacy.” You control what gets shared. Neither company will sell or distribute your data. Your calendar stays yours.</p><p>In a world where most “free” productivity apps are monetizing your every click, this actually matters.</p><h2 id="making-it-ridiculously-simple" tabindex="-1">Making it ridiculously simple</h2><p>Here’s how the Fastmail-Morgen integration makes your life easier:</p><ul> <li><strong>All your calendars in one place</strong>: Work, personal, shared — they all show up together so you can finally see what you’re working with</li> <li><strong>Smart scheduling</strong>: Morgen’s booking pages check your availability across <em>all</em> your calendars, eliminating the “wait, let me check my other calendar” dance</li> <li><strong>Tasks that become time</strong>: Stop maintaining a to-do list separately from your calendar - drag tasks onto your schedule and actually make them happen</li> <li><strong>Works everywhere</strong>: Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android - your unified calendar view goes wherever you do</li> </ul><h2 id="getting-started-takes-only-minutes" tabindex="-1">Getting started takes only minutes</h2><ol> <li>Sign up and download <a href="https://www.morgen.so/fastmail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morgen</a></li> <li>Connect your Fastmail account</li> <li>Add any other calendars you’re juggling</li> <li>Start actually seeing your whole life in one place</li> </ol><p>That’s it. No complex setup, no IT degree required — just a few clicks to get started.</p><h2 id="the-real-bottom-line" tabindex="-1">The Real Bottom Line</h2><p>More calendars don’t make you more organized. They make you more stressed.</p><p>What you need isn’t another app or another system, or another calendar. You need to see everything in one place so you can make actual decisions about your time.</p><p>That’s what Morgen and Fastmail deliver: one view of your entire life, tools that actually help you manage it, and zero compromise on privacy.</p><p>Because at the end of the day, managing your life better isn’t about having more tools. It’s about having one clear view of what matters.</p>
