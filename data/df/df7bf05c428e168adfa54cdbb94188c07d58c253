Apple is planning to bring new AI features to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-06/apple-plans-to-allow-outside-voice-controlled-ai-chatbots-in-carplay">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple will allow third-party chatbot apps to integrate with &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, so AI services like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT will be accessible in the car for the first time.<br/>

&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; already supports third-party apps, but the types of apps that are supported are limited. Companies like Anthropic and OpenAI aren't currently able to create &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; apps, so users are limited to using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice controls in the vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
With the change, &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; users will be able to access apps like ChatGPT to ask questions hands-free, though the apps won't be able to control vehicle or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> functions. Third-party AI voice apps will not be accessible via a wake word and won't replace &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, so users will need to open an app to get access to a chatbot. App developers will be able to design in-car experiences that will launch a voice-based chat mode when the app is opened, which will streamline the process.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is planning to support third-party AI apps "within the coming months," which could align with when the company's smarter version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is set to launch. With iOS 26.4, Apple is debuting a more personalized version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that uses large language models.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to answer complex questions, complete multi-step tasks, maintain continuity, and do more in and between apps. The personal assistant is also set to gain a World Knowledge Answers feature, allowing it to search the web and summarize information from websites.<br/>
<br/>
Later in iOS 27, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will get full chatbot capabilities, allowing it to better compete with Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/06/apple-third-party-chatbots-carplay/">Apple to Allow ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini in CarPlay</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-allow-chatgpt-claude-and-gemini-in-carplay.2477298/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
