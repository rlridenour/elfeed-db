<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Learning to appreciate letting my mind and body find its rhythm, regardless of what the clock might say.
</p>
        <p>Lacey twice woke in the early hours of the day, and I took her and Ollie
outside.  The mercury claimed 1℉ with wind stripping the score well into the
negatives.  Even the dogs didn’t dawdle; business was done with an efficiency
the managing class would praise.</p>
<p>Out amidst the deep clawing and biting cold, I stood pajama’d with my body
wrapped in a quilted blanket.  I felt a stir and shift, and knew my mind was
waking in this second foray into frosts domain.</p>
<p>Most often I can get up with the dogs, take them out, and walk back to bed, and
fall asleep in under a minute.  But when my mind wakes, I know now not to fight
it.</p>
<p>Realizing that I would lay awake for a few hours, I ushered the dogs back to
bed, grabbed a pillow, and settled down to rest on the couch.  Wrapping myself
in the quilt that failed to hold the waking night at bay.</p>
<p>Having slept soundly for 6 hours, I accepted this bit of middle-of-the-night
awakedness.  I went to the fridge and poured a small glass of milk; something to
appease my belly for this brief wakening ahead.</p>
<p>Tonight, or is it tomorrow, would be a time of quiet solitude.  Maybe I’d read,
I thought.  And did so for a bit.</p>
<p>But then I set about writing, for that must’ve been what called to me from the
whispers of the cold winds, a memory adrift in the realm of Poetry.  One that I
could revisit as though guided by a ghost of some day past; that is were I able
to transcribe then recite the proper incantations.</p>
<p>Here and <time datetime="2025-01-20" title="2025-01-20">now</time>, one month past the winter solace, the morning still arrives late
and the day departs early.  I have ample time to both appreciate for an hour or
two the dark and still later claim an hour or more of shut-eye.</p>
<p>I once, years ago, might toss in my bed, worried about the sleep I was losing;
failing to appreciate the dark I was missing; not seeing nor being in those
quiet moments when the Earth is yet to be made for the day.</p>
<p>Yet <time datetime="2025-01-25" title="2025-01-25">now</time>, with my nest emptied and my commute discarded, I don’t need to worry so
much about the tyranny of the clock.  Whether I get about my day under the veil
of night, with the rising sun, or when the birds deem it safe to return to the
well-provisioned feeders: I’ll still have time to make that morning coffee
and steel myself for my waking obligations.</p>
