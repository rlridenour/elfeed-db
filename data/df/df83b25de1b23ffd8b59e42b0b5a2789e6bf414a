    Last night, interested Emacsians from around the PDX area gathered
    together for a <i>hack night</i>, with a goal to implement a rudimentary,
    breadcrumb project.  The basics of how to make a breadcrumb project
    should be easy to grasp for a group of hackers… and also fun to
    extend after everyone leaves to home.

    I polished my notes from the evening and cleaned up some of the
    function and variable names (no, they weren't offensive… just silly).

    The <a href="https://github.com/howardabrams/dot-files/blob/master/elisp/better-breadcrumbs.el">end result</a> turned out to be a great start to a personalized
    approach to remembering and jumping to file positions.
