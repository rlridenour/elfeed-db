<p>French President Emmanuel Macron urged European Union leaders to act more like a global power, warning that Europe faces sharper strategic pressure from China and Russia—and renewed friction with the United States, including over trade and digital regulation. He said a recent transatlantic flare-up he dubbed the “Greenland moment” should be a wake-up call for the EU to speed up long-discussed reforms and cut dependencies, including on the US. Ahead of an informal EU leaders’ retreat on competitiveness in Belgium, Macron called for a “Made in Europe” approach and bigger investment in strategic sectors such as defense, security, green technologies, and advanced tech. He also pushed steps to make the single market work better and to shield European industry from external shocks. A centerpiece of his pitch is a new joint EU borrowing capacity—often described as eurobonds—to help pay for these priorities. Germany’s government publicly rejected the idea, arguing that the focus should stay on productivity and the EU’s next long-term budget framework. Macron cast the tensions as a chance to build momentum. He said Europe’s unity during the Greenland dispute showed the bloc can stand together, and he urged leaders to turn that cohesion into faster decisions and investment that could strengthen Europe’s resilience in a shifting world order.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/v4LbimNOhlGP1iz5h028Nkb06UKxAIMoO4Lo41T3nQ9FU9QLmfuwuDE4ca7TO_WCSfcd1GkHKiII4Hob-iES0MeaDlHct0CPIScd9jhVC4z0Pw6aqnSlQ16AEhXBznmyFbBnBOheGuWM8bB79IA8CtV_k9d1y638wFwp7XAitI6AnRIQJJqLi14_oFi2UYSEIGpaYMqOcQfwHGAv3DWcM5CJpYcQzdDT3-A5FVk' alt='French President Emmanuel Macron during an interview at the Élysée Palace.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Eurobonds push: In an interview with six European outlets, Macron said the EU’s budget is too tight and called for a new common borrowing capacity—often described as “eurobonds”—to fund strategic investment and keep pace with the US and China.</li><li>Berlin pushes back: Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s government swatted down the eurobonds idea within hours of the interview’s publication.
