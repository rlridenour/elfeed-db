<li>This stuff is best-by 2027; we only got our hands on it because they changed the packaging</li>
<li>People seem to think milk thistle is decent for your liver</li>
<li>There’s other stuff too that no one agrees on</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: Maybe let’s leave the marg jokes for when we’re talking about something other than liver health</li>
</ul><h1>In Addition To</h1><p>If you’re curious why we keep selling this stuff, the answer’s pretty simple. Every time we sell, it… uhh… sells.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t buy it.</p>
<p>And I mean that in the figurative sense as well as the literal.</p>
<p>As discussed <a href="https://meh.com/deals/6-pack-nature-s-craft-liver-cleanse-detox-repair-formula-6-month-supply-10">last time we sold this</a>, the evidence of liver detox supplements’ effectiveness is pretty sparse. It doesn’t really scare me, necessarily. And, truth be told, I wouldn’t rank it among the top 10 products that have tested my morals. Like, remember when we sold weight loss coffee? Or that <em>other</em> coffee?</p>
<p>I’m sorry, milk thistle doesn’t really stack up against stuff like that.</p>
<p>But also, again, I literally don’t buy it. As in: I don’t spend my money on this stuff. I’ve never taken it. It’s just not for me.</p>
<p>I do, however, want to share one comment from the last sale. A user mentioned that they had a fatty liver and asked how effective this stuff is, to which another user replied with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These should be considered “support” for liver health. They’re not going to “cure” fatty liver. That’ll be more a function of one’s diet. Talk to your doctor first, but I take two Milk Thistle extract every day &amp; combined with a <strong>MUCH</strong> healthier diet have reversed my fatty liver disease in one year’s time. (I’ve also lost 128# over the past year, which helps significantly!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, just to be clear: these comments are, as far as I know, not from a medical professional. But I can appreciate the sentiment.</p>
<p>A new exercise regimen, a totally different approach to your diet, a major shift in your relationship to alcohol and sugar–these are significant lifestyle changes to make, and progress is rarely linear. One week will be wildly productive, the next replete with unforeseeable setbacks.</p>
<p>Taking a supplement every day won’t fix things on its own, but it might work as a daily reminder to stay vigilant.</p>
<p>Hypothetically speaking.</p>
<p>Again, I don’t use them. But some people seem to.</p>
<p>And if you’re one of them, maybe buy some. We’ve got it for pretty cheap.</p>
