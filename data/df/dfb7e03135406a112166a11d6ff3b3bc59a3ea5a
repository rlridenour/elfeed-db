<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> adds several features to the built-in Wallet app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, providing a new way to track your online shopping, an update to boarding passes, and more. We've outlined everything new in the Wallet app below. <br/>

<h2 id="order_tracking">Order Tracking</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; Wallet app features enhanced order tracking, and you can now use it to track all of your purchases rather than just those made using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007755" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/ios-26-order-tracking-wallet.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> is used to locate order related information from the Mail app, and then orders are pulled into the Wallet app. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can detect tracking numbers and order numbers, and update the status of packages as they move from order to delivery.<br/>
<br/>
Orders can be accessed by tapping on the "..." button in the Wallet app and tapping on the Orders option. The feature is opt-in, and you do need a device capable of &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; to use it.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that order tracking in the Wallet app is being made available in a beta capacity, and it's not perfect yet. Some orders don't update properly and need to be manually marked as complete, and some don't show up in the app.<br/>
<h2 id="digital_ids">Digital IDs</h2><br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, Apple Wallet will allow &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to add a U.S. passport that can be used in lieu of a physical passport for domestic travel.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005400" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/ios-26-digital-id-passport-wallet.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
The Digital ID can be stored on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or the Apple Watch, and it can be used at select TSA checkpoints throughout the United States. It is Real ID-compliant, as a passport can be presented instead of a Real ID when traveling.<br/>
<br/>
Digital IDs do not replace physical passports, and Apple warns that they cannot be used for international travel or border crossings. In these situations, a physical passport will be required, but for domestic travel, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users won't need to pull out a passport and can instead pass through TSA checkpoints more quickly.<br/>
<br/>
As with state driver's licenses and IDs, Digital IDs will work for age and identity verification in apps, retail store locations, and new in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, websites.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="enhanced_boarding_passes">Enhanced Boarding Passes</h2><br/>
Boarding passes for flights that are stored in the Wallet app are able to display more information in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;. You'll see maps that will help you navigate through the airport, and an option to access <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> to track items, report missing bags, and more using the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; airline integration features.<br/>

<h2 id="live_activities_support">Live Activities Support</h2><br/>
Boarding passes in the Wallet app support Live Activities, providing real-time updates on a flight. Flight information will be displayed on the Lock Screen and in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, plus the Live Activity for a flight can be shared with other people.<br/>

<h2 id="credit_card_info">Credit Card Info</h2><br/>
The Wallet app settings now includes an "AutoFill" section where you can view and store full credit card details like card number, expiration date, and security code. <br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="ad_controls">Ad Controls</h2><br/>
Apple added an option to turn off offers and promotions sent through the Wallet app, so you can turn off ads like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/24/apple-wallet-notification-f1-movie-ad/">the F1 offer</a> that Apple received criticism for.<br/>
<br/>

To turn off ads, open the Wallet app and tap on the three dots in the upper right corner. From there, toggle off the Offers and Promotions button.<br/>
