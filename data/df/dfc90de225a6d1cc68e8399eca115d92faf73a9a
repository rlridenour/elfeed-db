Apple's website does not currently list the amount of unified memory included in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">Vision Pro with the M5 chip</a>, but <em>MacRumors</em> has confirmed that the latest version of the headset is equipped with the same 16GB of RAM as the previous model.<br/>

The M5 chip supports up to 32GB of unified memory <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-macbook-pro-with-m5-chip/">in the new 14-inch MacBook Pro</a>, but Apple has opted to keep the new Vision Pro at 16GB of RAM.<br/>
<br/>
We also wanted to highlight that the Vision Pro now ships with Apple's newer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/17/apple-40w-to-60w-charger-key-advantage/">40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max</a> in the U.S., Canada, and select other countries. The previous model shipped with Apple's 30W USB-C Power Adapter, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/12/apple-stops-selling-30w-usb-c-power-adapter/">which was discontinued</a> in countries where the 40W-to-60W charger was released.<br/>
<br/>
However, the new Vision Pro still ships with Apple's international 30W USB-C Power Adapter variants in some countries, such as the U.K. and Australia.<br/>
<br/>
As we previously reported, other key Vision Pro changes beyond the M5 chip include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/new-accessories-for-vision-pro-now-available/">a more comfortable Dual Knit Band</a> in the box, along with 120Hz support for reduced motion blur and a smoother experience while using the Mac Virtual Display feature.<br/>
<br/>
