While the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/10/airpods-pro-3-features/">AirPods Pro 3</a> launched only six weeks ago, Apple is reportedly already working on new AirPods Pro, with two key changes rumored for the earbuds.<br/>

Specifically, the next AirPods Pro are expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/12/new-airpods-pro-airpods-5-h3-chip-rumors/">equipped with Apple's <strong>H3 chip</strong></a> for wireless audio, along with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/07/airpods-pro-3-this-year-per-kuo/">tiny <strong>infrared cameras</strong></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the H3 chip will offer improved sound quality and lower latency, compared to the H2 chip in the AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 3.<br/>

Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/%E9%85%8D%E5%82%99ir%E7%9B%B8%E6%A9%9F%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B0%E6%AC%BEairpods%E5%8F%AF%E6%9C%9B%E6%8F%90%E5%8D%87%E4%BA%BA%E6%A9%9F%E4%BA%A4%E4%BA%92%E9%AB%94%E9%A9%97%E8%88%87%E5%BC%B7%E5%8C%96apple%E7%A9%BA%E9%96%93%E9%9F%B3%E8%A8%8A-%E7%A9%BA%E9%96%93%E9%81%8B%E7%AE%97%E7%94%9F%E6%85%8B-new-ir-camera-equipped-airpods-to-enhance-2daa96913d7f">previously said</a> AirPods with infrared cameras could enable "in-air gesture control," but he did not elaborate on that possibility. He also expects the next AirPod Pro to have improved Vision Pro integration.<br/>
<br/>
The cameras could enable some artificial intelligence features, akin to Visual Intelligence on the iPhone 15 Pro and newer, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
No other features have been rumored yet.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if the next AirPods Pro would be AirPods Pro 4, or if they would still be AirPods Pro 3. AirPods Pro 2 were updated with a USB-C charging case and a few other tweaks a year after they launched, without receiving a name change.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the next AirPods Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/07/airpods-pro-3-this-year-per-kuo/">will launch in 2026</a>. If that timeframe proves to be accurate, then revised AirPods Pro 3 sounds likely, given there was a three-year gap between the AirPods Pro, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods Pro 3.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/29/what-to-expect-from-next-airpods-pro/">What to Expect From Apple&#039;s Next AirPods Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apples-next-airpods-pro.2470074/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
