<p>Give&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Weil">Dr. Andrew Weil</a> three minutes, and he can teach you a 60-second technique for falling asleep. Above, the alternative medicine guru walks you through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drweil.com/videos-features/videos/the-4-7-8-breath-health-benefits-demonstration/">4–7‑8 breathing method.&nbsp;</a>As he demonstrates, it “takes almost no time, requires no equipment and can be done anywhere.” And once you master it, you can use the&nbsp;4–7‑8 breathing technique&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.drweil.com/videos-features/videos/the-4-7-8-breath-health-benefits-demonstration/">explained and demonstrated in greater detail here</a>&nbsp;)&nbsp;to lower your anxiety levels (useful these days!), navigate tension-filled moments, and deal with food cravings.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Weil has said, “If I had to limit my advice on healthier living to just one tip, it would be simply to learn how to breathe correctly.” Hence why he created an audio recording,&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2k8riHQ"><em>Breathing: The Master Key to Self Healing</em></a>, which you can still purchase online.</p>
