<p>Mark Gurman got some interesting quotes from interesting former Apple employees for his report at Bloomberg on Jeff Williams’s retirement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Jeff’s importance and contributions to Apple have been enormous,
although perhaps not always obvious to the general public,” said
Tony Blevins, a former Apple operations vice president who
reported to Williams until the end of 2022. “As a shareholder, I
am saddened. Time takes its toll, and it’s almost as if the band
is dissolving. Jeff will be sorely missed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blevins is a fascinating character. A hard-charging negotiator nicknamed “the Blevinator”, Blevins was somewhat ignominiously <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/29/tony-blevins-leaving-apple-over-vulgar-tiktok-video/">run out of Apple</a> in 2022 after he appeared in a TikTok video that went viral making a joke that, out of context, seemed very crude, but was in fact just a quote from the mildly crude 1981 Dudley Moore hit movie <em>Arthur</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Clearly he wasn’t destined to be the Tim Cook replacement,” Bob
Mansfield, the company’s former chief of hardware engineering
under both Cook and co-founder Steve Jobs, said of Williams. “He’s
about the same age as Tim, so that wouldn’t make much sense. The
operations team at Apple is really going to miss Jeff.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mansfield is the only ex-Apple person I’ve seen quoted who addressed the succession issue. (And of course, no current Apple people are quoted anywhere, other than in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-announces-chief-operating-officer-transition/">Apple’s PR announcement of Williams’s retirement</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Myoung Cha, who reported to Williams in the health group until
2021, said the outgoing COO’s “personal passion for health” helped
shape the Apple Watch and that his presence on the team will be
“hugely missed.”</p>

<p>“Sabih is very much cut from the Tim Cook cloth,” said Matthew
Moore, a former Apple operations engineer. “Jeff was a little more
product minded; Sabih is just a really brilliant operator and
methodical in the same way that Tim would operate.” Moore added
that Khan has already been running Apple’s operations group and
that the team “won’t miss a beat.” “The concerns will be in the
other areas” that Williams currently oversees, he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/07/jeff_williams_is_retiring_as_coo">Williams’s “overseeing” of design yesterday</a>. Design — software at least — has already become a concern in the six years since Jony Ive left Apple, which is when design teams started reporting to Williams. And, frankly, it’s been a concern for many of us ever since <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2012/10/forstall_out">Scott Forstall was fired and Ive put all design — HI and ID — under the same roof</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-announces-chief-operating-officer-transition/">Apple did announce yesterday</a> that after Williams fully retires at the end of this year, design leaders will start reporting to Tim Cook directly. Left unsaid in Apple’s announcement is who will take over Williams’s roles overseeing Apple Watch and Health. I presume Watch will simply fall under John Ternus (SVP hardware) and that Sumbul Desai, who already has the title VP of health and frequently (always?) appears during the Health segments of Apple keynotes, will report directly to Cook.</p>
