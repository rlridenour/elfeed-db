Best Buy advertises a starting price for the M5 iPad Pro of &#36;499 with trade-in of an M4 Wi-Fi model with 512GB of storage, but between member trade-in bonuses and cash discounts, you can likely bring the out-of-pocket cost down even more, so be sure to check trade-in offers and your final cart price.<br/>

<br/>
A My Best Buy Plus membership is priced at &#36;49.99 per year, so the &#36;50 discount on the iPad Pro pays for a year's membership by itself, and any discounts on other products and additional membership benefits like free 2-day shipping and extended return windows become essentially free bonuses.<br/>
<br/>
My Best Buy Total is a higher-tier plan priced at &#36;179.99 per year, but it includes benefits like up to two years of protection such as AppleCare+ on purchases, discounted repairs, and premium Geek Squad support.<br/>
