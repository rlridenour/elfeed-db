<p>Scheduled to drop Monday, but you can click-through to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/puzzmo-solve-smile-share/id6714482734">pre-download it now</a>. If you’re not familiar, Puzzmo is sort of a collection of “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23929222/puzzmo-newspaper-games-crossword-zach-gage">newspaper puzzle games for the online age</a>”. (Which is also a good description for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/lex-games">recent DF sponsor</a> <a href="https://lex.games/df">Lex.Games</a>.) One of Puzzmo’s cofounders is <a href="http://stfj.net/">Zach Gage</a>, whose hits include <a href="http://www.reallybadchess.com/">Really Bad Chess</a> and <a href="https://playknotwords.com/">Knotwords</a>, and who was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/05/09/ep-346">my guest on The Talk Show back in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, if casual puzzle games are your jam, you should check out Puzzmo. My suggestion is check them out now, see how you like it as a web app on your iPhone, and then compare when the app hits the App Store on Monday. Puzzmo is a really good web app. I bet, though, the app is better.</p>
