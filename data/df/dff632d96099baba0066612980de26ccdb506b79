The annual Swift Student Challenge gives <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/eligibility/">eligible student developers</a> around the world the opportunity to showcase their coding capabilities by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/get-ready/">using the Swift Playground or Xcode apps</a> to create an interactive "app playground."<br/>
<br/>
Apple said winners will be selected based on submissions that "demonstrate excellence in innovation, creativity, social impact, or inclusivity." A subset of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/distinguished-winners/">Distinguished Winners</a> with "truly exceptional" submissions will be invited to visit Apple in Cupertino, California for three days in summer 2026, with travel and lodging included.<br/>
<br/>
Distinguished Winners are typically invited to attend Apple's annual developers conference WWDC, at the company's Apple Park headquarters. Apple has yet to announce WWDC 2026 dates, but the weeklong conference is typically held in June.<br/>
<br/>
WWDC 2026 is where Apple will announce iOS 27, iPadOS 27, macOS 27, watchOS 27, tvOS 27, visionOS 27, and other software updates.<br/>
