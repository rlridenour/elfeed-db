<p>Severe monsoon flooding in southern Thailand has killed at least 33 people across several provinces after days of exceptionally heavy rain, including what officials described as a &quot;once in 300 years&quot; downpour in the city of Hat Yai. The floods have affected around two million people, cutting off communities, inundating homes and hospitals, and stranding residents and tourists as water levels rose to several metres in places. Thai authorities have declared a state of emergency in Songkhla province, deployed an aircraft carrier, helicopters, boats and military trucks, and begun airlifting critical patients while converting university campuses into temporary shelters. In neighbouring Malaysia, days of rain have also triggered floods across multiple northern states, forcing tens of thousands from their homes and showing how increasingly intense weather is affecting communities across Southeast Asia.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/oBBpr035TlOWGX-KKKB4b7ZEHFktOc56WDW9xQd9RYm2rDc25SF47D2nqjNO00mEgAzQbdIr76C-xUYKHuPnpqS89c03K0CNdK4F8b3govSP' alt='Floodwaters surround homes and streets in Hat Yai, a major city in Thailand’s southern Songkhla province.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tourists stranded: Around 7,000 foreign visitors, mainly from Malaysia and Singapore, became trapped in Hat Yai hotels and high-rise buildings when floodwaters submerged streets and disrupted mobile networks and electricity in parts of the city.</li><li>Songkhla emergency response: Songkhla province has evacuated more than 10,000 residents, set up food centres capable of producing up to 20,000 meal boxes daily, and turned university campuses into shelters for displaced families.</li><li>Medical evacuations: Thailand’s military deployed helicopters and an aircraft carrier to move patients from flooded hospitals and isolated districts to functioning medical facilities as waters rose across at least nine provinces.</li><li>Infrastructure disruption: Flooding forced the temporary shutdown of the Chana power plant in Songkhla due to high water, although other power stations continued operating to keep most of the grid online.</li><li>Regional spread: Malaysian authorities reported flooding across eight states after days of heavy rain in areas bordering Thailand, with more than 27,000 people moving into relief centres as forecasters warned of further rainfall.</li></ul><blockquote>The water level is expected to recede in the south. - Siripong Angkasakulkiat</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Thai government: Officials said that while dozens of people have died across several southern provinces, they expect water levels to start falling and emphasised that emergency teams are continuing evacuations and relief operations.
