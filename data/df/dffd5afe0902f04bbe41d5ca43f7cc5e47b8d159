<p>President Trump said Venezuela’s interim authorities agreed to provide the United States with between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil, describing it as “sanctioned oil,” and said he had directed Energy Secretary Chris Wright to execute the plan immediately. He said the oil would be sold at market prices, and that the proceeds would be controlled by him as president to ensure they benefit both Venezuelans and Americans. Venezuelan acting/interim leader Delcy Rodríguez pushed back on the idea of outside control, saying Venezuela is not run by a “foreign agent”. The announcement comes amid fast-moving US-Venezuela developments following the reported capture of President Nicolás Maduro, which multiple outlets describe as a significant turning point in Washington’s leverage over Venezuela’s oil sector.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eJ2dvgW6LroFWt5vIx-1Owwx5cY4KMEeoPOXmZMeNSzMF7t2DfmdgqTR2KurQt9NwMScJ7TbUDAbQszddY2IbZgsxvUyNXM7W6z8DAXdiMSj2Yyo2s4ei0I1ca6XKPgY0-yHI7Yn3XxsNb8JrviLLEXt6PZmoKwOeEY49UJABE9n6pmXx0EkHagGh_F1FqDpaBmAG8TtXOFhgKFj_a9YgycG-00-DhAtABwKINY-EVZcQh1kxcQkfotrG5HWFx9ZBWzqDw-Ul_ULoVZBJw' alt='A macaw stands on a decorative oil drill in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Logistics shift: Reuters-cited sources said supplying the crude to the US may require redirecting cargoes that had been bound for China, Venezuela’s top buyer in the past decade.</li><li>Output ambitions: President Trump separately said US oil firms could be “up and running” in Venezuela within 18 months, signaling an interest in restarting investment and operations beyond this one-off transfer.</li><li>Executive meeting: The White House is organizing a Friday meeting with US oil executives about Venezuela; attendees are expected to include Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips, according to a person familiar with the plans.</li><li>Market ripple: Oil prices fell after Trump’s announcement, according to The Guardian’s reporting on market reaction.</li><li>Value estimates: Some coverage pegged the shipment’s gross value at roughly $2.8 billion at current prices, illustrating the scale of the proposed sale.</li></ul><blockquote>This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States! - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US President Donald Trump: He framed the oil sale as a deal with Venezuela’s interim authorities and said the US presidency would control the proceeds to ensure benefits flow to both countries, while directing Energy Secretary Chris Wright to carry it out quickly.
