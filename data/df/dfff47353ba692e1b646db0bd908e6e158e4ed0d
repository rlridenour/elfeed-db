Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> shipments are expected to grow nearly 4% in 2025, lifting the entire smartphone industry as rivals face slower demand and regional setbacks, according to new data from <a href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53767725">IDC</a>.<br/>

IDC has raised its 2025 worldwide smartphone forecast, projecting 1% year-over-year growth to 1.24 billion units, compared with its earlier May forecast of just 0.6%. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is the main driver behind the increase, which is now expected to expand 3.9% this year. IDC noted that without Apple, the global smartphone market would be flat or in decline.<br/>
<br/>
The resilience of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; stands in contrast to weakening Android sales, particularly in China. IDC emphasized that trade-in offers, installment plans, and customer loyalty have enabled Apple to sustain upgrades in an environment where many users now keep smartphones for four years or more. The firm said most &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; customers remain committed to iOS, a factor that has helped Apple expand its share even as other manufacturers pursue lower-cost volume.<br/>
<br/>
Average selling prices in the smartphone industry are forecast to increase 5% in 2025, with overall value rising 6%. IDC attributed this to a vendor focus on premiumization, supported by promotions and interest-free financing. Apple has leaned heavily on this approach, doubling down on its premium lineup while making devices more attainable through trade-in programs and carrier partnerships. IDC also highlighted the growing importance of on-device generative AI features.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple continues to dominate the premium sector, its performance is closely tied to U.S. carriers. A <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/apple-loyalty-depends-on-carrier">separate report</a> from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) covering June 2024 to June 2025 found that about three-quarters of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales in the United States occur through AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile.<br/>
<br/>
CIRP said overall &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; loyalty is 89%, climbing to 92% among customers who remain with their carrier but dropping to 79% when users switch providers. The report noted that promotions and in-store staff influence remain significant in determining whether buyers choose &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or switch to Android alternatives. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirp/">CIRP</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/idc/">IDC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/28/iphone-lifts-smartphone-market-shipments/">iPhone Lifts Smartphone Market Shipments as Rivals Stall</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-lifts-smartphone-market-shipments-as-rivals-stall.2464175/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
