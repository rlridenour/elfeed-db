<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The NCBQ seeks to foster intellectual inquiry on moral issues by publishing articles that address the ethical, philosophical, theological, and clinical questions raised by the rapid pace of modern medical and technological progress. Inspired by the harmony of faith and reason, the NCBQ unites faith in Christ to reasoned and rigorous reflection on the findings of the empirical and experimental sciences. While the NCBQ is committed to publishing material that is consonant with the magisterium of the Catholic Church, it remains open to other faiths and to secular viewpoints in the spirit of informed dialogue.</em></p>
<p>What does it mean for a journal to say that it will not publish &#8220;views that are clearly contrary to the established teachings of the Catholic Church&#8221; but that &#8220;it remains open to other faiths and to secular viewpoints in the spirit of informed dialogue&#8221;?</p>
<p>Recently, a philosopher whose work was critiqued in an NCBQ article found out.</p>

It invited him to consider writing a reply, saying, in part:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>&#8230;this is one of several of our regular columns by a regular columnist that reports on, reviews, and responds to select publications in philosophy and theology, especially but not exclusively in journals&#8230;  You can decide if this column warrants a reply. </em><em>Since our principal scope is Catholic bioethics, we do have an editorial policy in our submission guidelines that “the NCBQ is committed to publishing material that is consonant with the magisterium of the Catholic Church” and “We do not publish any work advancing views that are clearly contrary to established teachings of the Catholic Church.” Basically, we wouldn’t be willing to publish a defense of the permissibility of direct procured abortion, for example, but we would be willing to publish a letter critiquing the columnist’s argument, defending yourself against misrepresentation or misunderstanding or the like, or pointing to other publications where you have already responded to his concerns.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Professor Nobis submitted a reply article, “<a href="https://www.nathannobis.com/2025/07/reply-to-christopher-kaczor-on-abortion.html">Reply to Christopher Kaczor on Abortion</a>”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He soon heard back from the journal&#8217;s editor-in-chief, <a href="https://www.ncbcenter.org/meet-the-ethicists/edwardfurton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edward (Ted) Furton</a>, who said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>We have received your reply to Dr. Christopher Kaczor concerning abortion.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Your reply generally argues that moral arguments offered in opposition to the killing of unborn human beings are false and that therefore the practice should be permissible (except, if I understand, for late term pregnancies). Our journal does not print submissions that contradict established Catholic teaching on moral matters.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The Managing Editor has suggested that your reply and perhaps a further response from Dr. Kaczor might be published in another journal so that the discussion can continue. We would be happy to facilitate that effort, if we can.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Nobis replied, in part:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Thank you for your response but your evaluation here doesn&#8217;t seem to be correct. This was a response article that showed that Kaczor&#8217;s objections to our arguments and claims were poor. This was not any new defense, or really any defense, of our positive claims: it was just &#8220;these critiques are weak and here&#8217;s why.&#8221; I was told earlier that such a response would be allowable. </em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Furton replied:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The claims of weakness in Dr. Kaczor’s arguments are difficult to separate from the substance of your position. You hold that his arguments fail. Therefore, it follows that your position in defense of abortion is untouched and so remains true.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">To which Nobis wrote:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>&#8230;your conclusion does not follow here:</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 80px;"><em>&#8220;You hold that his arguments fail. [<strong>yes</strong>] Therefore, it follows that your position in defense of abortion is untouched [<strong>yes, untouched by those objections</strong>] and so remains true. [<strong>no: that does not follow: that some claims/arguments are poor objections to some arguments for conclusion p does not entail that p is true or that p is supported by good arguments: that&#8217;s a separate matter, requiring a separate &#8220;positive&#8221; defense</strong>]. </em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I do want to share what I was told earlier:</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 80px;"><em>we wouldn’t be willing to publish a defense of the permissibility of direct procured abortion, for example, but we would be willing to publish a letter critiquing the columnist’s argument, defending yourself against misrepresentation or misunderstanding or the like, or pointing to other publications where you have already responded to his concerns&#8230;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>What I am unclear on now is whether your policy means that really pretty much any critique of these critiques would be considered a defense of the permissibility of abortion&#8212;since any saying &#8220;well, this was a poor reason to think that this pro-choice argument was  a bad argument&#8221; is, in a way, a kind of defense of abortion&#8212;and so this is pretty much an impossible task here, for this forum.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Furton replied:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Thanks for your observations, but this is not merely a matter of logic. Perhaps I erred in encouraging a response from you and Dr. Dudley, but I wanted to see if it might work&#8230;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">This response by Nobis was the last bit of the exchange:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You are correct that this is not merely a matter of logic. </em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Presumably, you want people to think abortion is wrong, on the basis of good arguments. And you want people to have responses to pro-choice arguments that are, or are based on, good arguments.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Kaczor&#8217;s responses to our arguments were very poor. Not considering publishing something that shows this because of the (logical) error of not distinguishing &#8220;these objections to arguments for p are poor&#8221; and &#8220;here are good arguments for p&#8221; is bad. This results in your readers missing an opportunity to have a stronger understanding and better arguments on these issues.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Now, we have no &#8220;right&#8221; to a reply here, or even a reply being considered, but some offer for a reply was given. If this really was an impossible task, since almost any response would have been perceived as a positive argument for abortion, then that offer should have never been made. </em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Nobis shared the exchange on his <a href="https://www.nathannobis.com/2025/07/on-denied-opportunity-for-rebuttal-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> (and via email, Furton confirmed its accuracy). Nobis prefaced his account of it with a brief discussion of premises, conclusions, arguments, and criticism, reminding readers, for example, that &#8220;One can critique an argument’s premises without taking any stance on whether the conclusion is true or false.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To sum up, in this case, Nobis (and Dudley) had first, in <em>Salon:</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(1) argued against arguments against the permissibility of abortion</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then Kaczor, critiquing Nobis in the NCBQ:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(2) argued against arguments against arguments against the permissibility of abortion.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Then Nobis, in his reply to Kaczor:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>(3) argued against arguments against arguments against arguments against the permissibility of abortion. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The editor-in-chief of the journal took 3 to be equivalent to arguing in favor of the permissibility of abortion and rejected it because the journal does not publish work advocating views &#8220;that are clearly [!] contrary to the established teachings of the Catholic Church.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like some other journals, the NCBQ publishes peer reviewed and non-peer reviewed writing. My understanding is that Kaczor&#8217;s piece was not a peer-reviewed submission; it&#8217;s a regularly appearing column in the journal. But had it been, presumably, the same policy invoked in rejecting Nobis&#8217;s reply, interpreted in the same way, would have applied.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The episode raises interesting questions about the policies of religious and other ideological journals and their role in the academic ecology. Discussion welcome.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>ADDENDUM</strong>: Some criticisms of the journal and the editor are rolling in, and that&#8217;s fine, but it may be useful for people to also think about how to do an ideological journal <em>well</em>. I understand that on the face of it such a journal may seem to many people at odds with the academic enterprise, but need it be? Isn&#8217;t there room for robustly academic inquiry and debate that takes for granted certain assumptions? (Doesn&#8217;t most academic inquiry and debate take for granted certain assumptions?)</p>
