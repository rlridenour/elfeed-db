<p>They say that history is written by the victors, but that isn’t always true: sometimes it’s embroidered by the victors. Such was the case with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayeux_Tapestry">Bayeux Tapestry</a>, which commemorates the build-up to and successful execution of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Conquest">Norman conquest of England in 1066</a>. Created not long after the events it depicts in what we now call the United Kingdom, the nearly 230-foot-long cloth has been kept in France for most of its existence. But as <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/1026805/bayeux-tapestry-to-return-to-uk-after-nearly-1000-years/">reported by Hyperallergic’s Isa Farfan</a>, the Bayeux Tapestry is now set for a yearlong sojourn back in its homeland, and at no less an august institution than the British Museum, after spending the better part of a millennium abroad.</p>
<p>In a style that may strike twenty-first-century viewers as a predecessor to the graphic novel — or even to the straight-ahead comic book, with its grotesque exaggerations — the Bayeux Tapestry’s embroidery tells the story, writes Farfan, of “the victory of William the Conqueror, the Duke of Normandy, over England in the Battle of Hastings. William assembled a fleet of ships filled with thousands of men and horses to cross the English Channel and successfully claimed the throne from the last Anglo-Saxon king, Harold Godwinson.”</p>

<p>All this takes place over “58 scenes featuring more than 600 wool-threaded people and 200 horses. Though it focuses on the historical battle, the embroidery also reveals fixtures of broader eleventh-century life, including architecture and armor, and includes almost 400 Latin words accompanying the images.”</p>
<p>Those words are interpreted by YouTuber Lindybeige in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnieUa2-22o">the video above</a>, which offers a humorous animated tour of the full length of the Bayeux Tapestry — or, in any case, a very close replica made in England in the mid-nineteenth century. The elaborateness of its treatment underscores that the Norman conquest was one of the most momentous events, if not the most momentous event, in all of English history; the extent of its glorification underscores how much the conquerors felt the need to legitimize their rule. Nothing would ever be the same for English culture, English law, and even, <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2025/07/the-entire-history-of-english-in-22-minutes.html">as recently featured here on Open Culture,</a> the English language. If you go to London next year to behold the Bayeux Tapestry for yourself, you’ll hear the usual ambient grumbling about the state of England — with a refreshed emphasis, perhaps, on how wrong it all went after 1066.</p>
