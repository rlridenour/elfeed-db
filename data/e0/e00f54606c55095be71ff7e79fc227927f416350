Apple and its content partners are working on <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-previews-new-immersive-films-for-apple-vision-pro/">new immersive films designed</a> for the Vision Pro headset, including sports, travel, music, and nature-themed films. Immersive video is a major selling point of the Vision Pro, because it makes you feel like you're in the middle of the action.<br/>

Tour De Force from CANAL+ and MotoGP is available today through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app, and can be watched on the Vision Pro. Apple retail locations will be providing an extended preview starting next month, so if you don't have a Vision Pro, you can visit an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> to watch.<br/>

Tour De Force follows MotoGP rider Johann Zarco, documenting his win of the French Grand Prix at Le Mans in May 2025. It was filmed using four of Blackmagic Design's URSA Cine Immersive cameras, paired with ambisonic microphones for spatial audio.<br/>

Experience Paris, a travel film, will include visits to a three-Michelin-star kitchen, the Eiffel Tower, and Montmartre's historic streets. For music-related content, Apple this fall will debut a film on BBC Proms, a classical music festival, and a film featuring K-pop boy band CORTIS.<br/>
