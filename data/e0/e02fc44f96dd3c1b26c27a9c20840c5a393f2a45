Apple will resist a new Indian government directive that would require all iPhones sold in the country to ship with a preinstalled state-run security app, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-resist-india-order-preload-state-run-app-political-outcry-builds-2025-12-02/">Reuters</a></em>. <br/>

This week, India's Department of Telecommunications ordered all smartphone makers to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/india-iphone-preinstall-government-app/">preload Sanchar Saathi</a>, a non-removable government app designed to help users block stolen devices, report fraudulent calls, and verify second-hand phones. <br/>
<br/>
The app includes detailed tracking functionality controlled by the government, potentially opening a pathway for broad data access and potential surveillance, so there are privacy and security implications for iPhone users.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.tbsnews.net/world/south-asia/apple-resist-india-order-preload-state-run-app-political-outcry-builds-1300086">The Business Standard</a></em>, citing industry sources familiar with the matter, Apple has informed officials it does not plan to comply with the requirement. The company will reportedly tell the government it does not follow such mandates anywhere in the world as they raise a host of privacy and security issues for the company's iOS ecosystem. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's resistance to the directive will put added pressure on New Delhi, with political opposition parties already accusing the government of overreach.<br/>
<br/>
In response to the criticism, India's telecom minister Jyotiraditya M. Scindia on Tuesday said the app was "completely optional," adding that users can choose to activate it and can "easily delete it from their phone at any time." Scindia rejected allegations of surveillance, stating the app contains no provisions for snooping or call monitoring.<br/>
<br/>
There are more than 700 million smartphone users in India, so any final decision will have major implications for how much control the government can exert over device software and how far tech companies like Apple can go in enforcing their own privacy standards.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/02/apple-resists-india-order-state-app-iphones/">Apple to Resist India&#039;s Order to Preload Government App on iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-resist-indias-order-to-preload-government-app-on-iphones.2473668/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
