<p>The Texas A&amp;M University System&#8217;s Board of Regents took steps yesterday to impose its conservative ideology on college students by prohibiting professors from teaching certain ideas about race and gender. <span id="more-55590"></span></p>
<p>They did so by making <a href="https://www.tamus.edu/regents/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/11/Item-4.2-TAMUS-Policies-08.01-and-12.01-Revisions-2ND-REVISED-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changes to the system&#8217;s policies</a>. One change to the &#8220;Civil Rights Protection and Compliance&#8221; section of the policies they approved states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>No system academic course will advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity, unless the course and the relevant course materials are approved in advance by the member CEO.</em></p>
<p>The use of the term &#8220;advocate&#8221; in the policy is worth noting. It is a label for an inappropriate pedagogical approach (indeed professors should teach students, not lobby them) and it associates this inappropriate pedagogical approach with teaching about race and gender, insinuating that if students are hearing about race or gender in their course, it must be because their professors are doing something illicit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Advocate&#8221; is also a slippery concept. If a professor covers evidence for and against some aspect of gender or race &#8220;ideology,&#8221; when discussing the evidence in its favor, are they thereby &#8220;advocating&#8221; for gender ideology? What about devil&#8217;s advocacy? Is the use of that teaching tool banned when it comes to race and gender? What about explaining an idea without condemning it?</p>
<p>The policy bans courses that advocate race or gender ideology as well as courses that advocate &#8220;topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity.&#8221; But &#8220;advocate topics&#8221; is a very odd way to speak. They probably meant &#8220;include topics&#8221; but perhaps didn&#8217;t want to say that, since to say that discussion of certain topics in a college course is banned is too transparently dictatorial.</p>
<p>The inclusion of those topics is prohibited &#8220;unless the course and the relevant course materials are approved in advance by the member CEO.&#8221; This presupposes an impressive degree of administrative micromanagement. The idea that the administration may dictate the materials and subjects for all courses is quite a departure from the academic freedom that faculty at institutions like Texas A&amp;M expect.</p>
<p>What is gender or race ideology anyway? The policy offers the following definitions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Gender Ideology – means a concept of self-assessed gender identity replacing, and disconnected from, the biological category of sex. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Race Ideology – means a concept that attempts to shame a particular race or ethnicity, accuse them of being oppressors in a racial hierarchy or conspiracy, ascribe to them less value as contributors to society and public discourse because of their race or ethnicity, or assign them intrinsic guilt based on the actions of their presumed ancestors or relatives in other areas of the world. This also includes course content that promotes activism on issues related to race or ethnicity, rather than academic instruction.</em></p>
<p>A change to the section of the policies on &#8220;Academic Freedom, Responsibility, and Tenure&#8221; doubles down on the  micromanagement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Each faculty member is entitled to full freedom in the classroom in discussing the subject that the faculty member teaches, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a faculty member will not introduce a controversial matter that has no relation to the classroom subject or teach material that is inconsistent with the approved syllabus for the course</span>.  </em></p>
<p>The idea of the sacred syllabus was at the center of the university&#8217;s <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/09/10/be-careful-what-you-teach-trumps-minions-may-get-you-fired/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firing of Melissa McCoul</a> earlier this year. What does &#8220;inconsistent with the approved syllabus&#8221; mean? If it simply means &#8220;not on the syllabus&#8221; are the regents really saying that faculty cannot, say, teach an unscheduled lesson with an additional reading about a current event to which ideas covered elsewhere in the course might apply? If &#8220;inconsistent with the syllabus&#8221; means something besides &#8220;not on the syllabus,&#8221; then what does it mean? Perhaps: inconsistent with the ideology the Board is hoping to impose on students through the strict oversight of syllabi creation and course content.</p>

<p>The Board of Regents is also recruiting students into their political movement, encouraging them to be suspicious of their professors. The <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/texas-a-m-system-sharply-restricts-how-faculty-can-teach-about-race-and-gender" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em></a> reports:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>the system created a “24/7 reporting mechanism” for students to report what they consider “inaccurate or misleading course content” that does not align with the approved syllabus, as well as other course-related issues.</em></p>
<p>That ideology the Board of Regents seeks to impose on students doesn&#8217;t concern just race and gender, but the very aims of higher education. In a revealing quote about the policy changes reported in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/us/texas-am-gender-race-ideology-rules-classroom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, one of the regents, Sam Torn, said the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Curriculum is created and approved based on the accepted body of knowledge needed for our students to be successful in their chosen profession&#8230; It is unacceptable for other material to be taught instead.</em></p>
<p>In other words: students, your university education should be nothing more than job training.</p>
<p>What a message for the people in charge of a university system to send.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/11/14/a-mess-at-texas-am/">A Mess at Texas A&M</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
