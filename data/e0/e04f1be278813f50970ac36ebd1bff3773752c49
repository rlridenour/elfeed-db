Courtesy of a post from the_cecep over at the Emacs subreddit, I just discovered a builtin gem I didn&rsquo;t know about. The post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1ohr4uy/tip_use_deletepair_to_change_surroundings_similar/">is about the delete-pair function</a>. The idea is that you have some text surrounded by a pair of delimiters and you&rsquo;d like to delete the surrounding delimiters.
</p>
<p>
That&rsquo;s something that I sometimes want to do but it gets better. The_cecep shows how to quickly change <code>(foo)</code> to <code>[foo]</code> with <code>delete-pair</code>. That&rsquo;s something that I want to do less frequently than simply deleting the delimiters but it&rsquo;s still useful.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the_cecep&rsquo;s post for some more examples and a few details. He also recommends that because <code>delete-pair</code> is unbound you should bind it to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>z</kbd>, which he thinks of as &ldquo;zap pair&rdquo;. That seems like a good suggestion to me.
</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s a couple of things worth noting:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although the post doesn&rsquo;t make it clear, you don&rsquo;t need to select the expression if you just want to delete the delimiters.</li>
<li>You can set <code>delete-pair-blink-delay</code> to 0 to disable the delay if you don&rsquo;t want it. The default is 1 second so you should at least set it to a smaller value as the_cecep suggests.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I&rsquo;m really happy to learn about <code>delete-pair</code>. It&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m going to use every day but I will use it often enough to internalize it.</p>
