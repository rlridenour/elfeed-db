 
          <p>A friend convinced me to attend <a href="https://www.spiel-essen.de/">SPIEL Essen</a> this year, the largest board game fair in the world that attracts over two hundred thousand visitors yearly. It&rsquo;s crazy to have something like this close by. When we humble Belgians read about &ldquo;the world largest whatever&rdquo;, we usually say &ldquo;oh must be in the US, bummer&rdquo;. But no, this one&rsquo;s in Essen<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and that German city is only two hours driving away&mdash;not counting another hour of patiently queuing at the parking lot. Yesterday was my third <em>SPIEL</em> visit, the last one being from 2017, so it&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
<p>That being said, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll want to do this again any time soon, especially on a Sunday. As you can imagine, the halls were overcrowded, the queues were long, most shops were sold out, and the fresh air was long gone. We didn&rsquo;t stay to find out how busy the connecting highway was going to get during closing time. My friend&mdash;his first time on the fair grounds&mdash;called it <em>an experience</em>.</p>

<p>The experience being rushing towards hall two and three to get our hands on an English version of the <em>SETI</em> expansion that supposedly is nowhere else available (yet). The person behind the counter told us we were lucky because they had a few copies left and it was basically sold out since Friday. We were less lucky trying to score the mini-expansion of <em>The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth</em>: only the German editions were left. Most shops in the halls only sold German editions of games which is a bit odd considering people all over the world come to <em>SPIEL</em> to enjoy a good board game. Knizia&rsquo;s new <em>Lord of the Rings</em> roll and write? Sold out. I moved <em>Fate of the Fellowship</em> to my Christmas list instead.</p>
<p>During all that running around, I did spot a cheap English copy of <em>Dorfromantik Sakura</em>, a <em>Carcassonne</em>-like tile laying game with some Legacy elements to it. You gradually unlock more tiles that score differently and it&rsquo;s supposed to be lovely as a laid-back cooperative experience. Or you can enjoy it on your own. It was stamped for approval by my wife after our first playthrough today so it must be doing something right.</p>
<p>The second game I bought was <em>Urbion</em>, a solo card game in the <em>Onirim</em> universe (&ldquo;Oniverse&rdquo;) by Shadi Torbey. Shadi himself manned their small stand and helped us by explaining the difference between a few of the card games as I hesitated between buying <em>Urbion</em> or the more well-known <em>Onirim</em>. These have been on my list for a long time and it was great to meet an indie designer on the fair: most official meet-and-greets were planned on Friday. We even got to try <em>R.A.V.E.L.</em>, their latest logical puzzle involving the flipping of dice in order to meet certain criteria.</p>

<p>After the essentials were bagged, it was time to play. Depending on the free table spots, that is. We didn&rsquo;t really fancy waiting an hour just to play the popular ones and we also skipped heavier board games as these tend to take too long to explain let alone play. I did want to try out <em>Tea Garden</em> but had to content myself with staring at others playing it instead. The box was <code>€52</code> and the steeper price kept me from instantly buying it. <em>Fate of the Fellowship</em> was <code>€70</code>, by the way. Ouch: almost 12% more expensive than my usual shop (where it&rsquo;s out of stock but that&rsquo;s beyond the point). If you were expecting some kind of special fair prices, you&rsquo;d be sorely disappointed.</p>
<p><em>Creature Caravan</em> is another entry on the wishlist I hoped to try out but was nowhere to be seen. The Cult of the New strikes again: <em>SPIEL</em> is mostly about new releases, not about previous year&rsquo;s games, even though <em>Creature Caravan</em> is barely a year old. Instead, I discovered yet another iteration on Uwe Rosenberg&rsquo;s <em>Bohnanza</em> but this time with flowers. Yay, I guess? Speaking of Rosenberg, I found a German <em>Hallertau</em> in a shop (pass) while looking for the English <em>Nusfjord</em> (fail), making this my first <em>SPIEL</em> without buying a Rosenberg game. Sad times!</p>
<p>For me, one of the biggest reasons to attend this huge fair is BoardGameGeek&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Math_Trades">Math Trade</a>&rdquo;, a way to swap or buy/sell games from other Geek members that are also attending. Usually, around lunch time, on a set location in-between the halls or at the foyer, you&rsquo;ll see a lot of silly people walking around donned in bright striped T-shirts and straw hats, waving plaques in the air toting their BGG nickname to find their swapping buddy. That&rsquo;s usually the place to do great deals and get your hands on these rarer out of print boxes, but it does require carefully following the BGG SPIEL Math Trade forum thread which I neglected to do this year. I bought a near mint copy of <em>Nightfall</em> for only <code>€10</code> from a British chap there once. Now, <em>Nightfall</em> is nowhere to be found (contact me if you&rsquo;re interested).</p>
<p>The last game we played was <em>Bravest</em> from Maxime Rambourg, known for <em>The LOOP</em> and <em>The Big Book of Madness</em>.<em>Bravest</em> is an interesting road tile placement game where you try to fill up your board to maximize your score whilst also hate drafting tiles you think your opponent might use.  I&rsquo;d rather play his <em>Dracula vs Van Helsing</em> but hey, that game is two years old so doesn&rsquo;t get any table presence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I went home with &ldquo;only&rdquo; two games as there are a few funded Kickstarters headed my way early next year and I still have to dig into <em>Earthborne Rangers</em> that same friend gifted me for my birthday. So many games, so little time!</p>

<p>I suppose that is because board gaming in Germany is huge: most publishers you know are German ones (Kosmos, Haba, Pegasus Spiele, Lookout Games, Amigo, &hellip;).&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
