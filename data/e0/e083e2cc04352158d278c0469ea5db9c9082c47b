<p id="p1">The EU&rsquo;s Digital Markets Act requires Apple to allow third parties to offer web browsers with their own browser engines. However, more than a year later, there are no browsers built with Chromium, Gecko, or any other engine in the EU.</p>
<p id="p2">At a recent EU workshop on Apple&rsquo;s compliance with the DMA&rsquo;s browser requirements, Apple representatives were <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/apples-browser-engine-ban-persists-even-under-the-dma/" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked some pointed questions by Open Web Advocacy (OWA)</a>, and others about its browser engine policies. OWA, <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/contributors/" rel="noopener noreferrer">a non-profit that advocates for the open web</a>, raised multiple issues with Apple&rsquo;s approach to browser engines in the EU that they believe are holding back third-party engines.</p>
<p id="p3">One issue is that versions of the same browser with different engines can&rsquo;t be part of the same app bundle. According to OWA, that effectively means vendors like Google and Mozilla would need to release a new EU-only version of their browsers, starting the process of acquiring users from scratch, which I can&rsquo;t imagine any browser company would sign up to do voluntarily.</p>
<p id="p4">Another issue OWA raised is that there is currently no way for web developers outside the EU who are not associated with the browser makers to obtain browsers with competing engines for testing purposes. That&rsquo;s a problem that&rsquo;s been solved with other apps by allowing test versions to be distributed outside the EU. However, as things stand today, OWA says that web developers couldn&rsquo;t use EU-only browsers for testing even if there were any available.</p>
<p id="p5">Other issues were raised, too, but these two strike me as practical impediments to third-party browser engines that can and should be resolved. Apple&rsquo;s responses to OWA&rsquo;s challenges focused on privacy and security, which are legitimate factors to consider, but it&rsquo;s disappointing that more than a year after the DMA took effect, the practical problems raised by OWA and others still haven&rsquo;t been solved.</p>
