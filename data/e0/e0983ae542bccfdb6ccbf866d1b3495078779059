<p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said he asked Chinese leader Xi Jinping to help bring North Korea back to talks and curb its nuclear programme, during Lee’s trip to China this week—the first South Korean leader visit in six years.

He also floated a proposal to freeze North Korea’s nuclear and long-range missile development in exchange for “compensation,” while reiterating the longer-term aim of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wdTMyzC8dSGU1lE1lBQz_cdeE7cA6AIx5cVbncE8DK0nuq2eMlTKtAWuvk_E2_l7AHbfAdqUC120zKGNzHlpP5N8DkI1Q82svF5nMVHb5wOJ' alt='China’s President Xi Jinping and South Korea’s President Lee Jae Myung shake hands on Nov. 1, 2025. — AFP/File' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Missile backdrop: Lee’s comments came a day after North Korea fired two ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, underscoring the urgency Seoul says it faces.</li><li>Patience message: Lee said Xi urged Seoul to show “patience” on the nuclear issue, reflecting Beijing’s preference for a gradual approach given the current state of inter-Korean ties.</li><li>Freeze specifics: Lee described a possible initial “gain” as stopping further production of nuclear weapons, blocking any transfer of nuclear material abroad, and halting additional development of ICBMs.</li><li>Shared signals: Lee said he asked China to pass his proposal to Pyongyang and that he perceived agreement in Beijing on those general points.</li><li>Reset attempt: Seoul is also using the visit to pursue a broader reset with its biggest trading partner, linking security talks with an effort to stabilize the wider relationship.</li></ul><blockquote>We hope China can serve as a mediator — a mediator for peace - Lee Jae Myung</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>South Korea (President Lee Jae Myung): Lee says South-North channels are blocked and proposes a freeze of North Korea’s nuclear and missile development in exchange for “compensation,” asking China to mediate.
