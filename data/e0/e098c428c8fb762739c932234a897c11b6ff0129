<p>Japan’s fisheries authorities seized a Chinese fishing vessel and arrested its captain after the boat allegedly ignored an order to stop for an inspection and tried to flee while operating in waters Japan described as within its exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki Prefecture, multiple outlets reported on February 13. The seizure is expected to add friction to already strained Japan-China ties. Several outlets noted that ongoing maritime disputes and heightened political tensions have made even routine enforcement actions more sensitive.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Av6MORXz36ZZL2qIcYKcHYfNEHppduLbSzdszTQWhsqN7jKBn4B6TwScBLGB13NK_1rFlRixYyhtjlbvMU848Eysz2pTpMJANITrIyPjwHrqjGWAQnAYnDD301jzVY_bvBWqE8BBNMXEhA522RAwgvIgPye1nxpBrBypxs77ul5CGlXIQAPVSZpQBOVGYq4jLLQ6rA' alt='A photo released by Japan’s Fisheries Agency shows a Japanese patrol vessel (left) and a Chinese fishing boat off Nagasaki on Thursday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>First since 2022: Deutsche Welle said this was Japan’s first seizure of a Chinese fishing vessel since 2022, underscoring how rare such detentions have been in recent years.</li><li>Distance and timing: The Guardian and SCMP reported the seizure happened on Thursday, about 170km from the south-western port city of Nagasaki.</li><li>Diplomatic backdrop: SCMP said the incident follows a November flare-up in which Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi angered Beijing by suggesting Japan would intervene militarily if China sought to take Taiwan by force.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Japan’s Fisheries Agency: The agency said the vessel ignored an order to stop for an inspection and then fled.
