 
          <p>The more holiday seasons I see coming and going, the less enthused I am by the forced celebration that tastes an awful lot like capitalism. I put up my <a href="/post/2025/11/2025-holiday-gift-guide">gift guide</a> anyway, just in case anyone is willing to buy me that dough mixer, otherwise I&rsquo;ll have to do it in January as an early expense for the upcoming year. Thanks in advance! There isn&rsquo;t a lot of mental space left to prepare for celebrations anyway, with the second kid giving us an equally hard time as the first. Anyway. Welcome, last month of the year, I guess. The first one who plays <em>Last Christmas</em> <a href="https://whamageddon.com/">is out</a>.</p>
<p>Previous month: <a href="/post/2025/10/september-2025">September 2025</a>.</p>
<h2 id="book-ive-read">Book I&rsquo;ve read</h2>
<p>Lots!</p>
<p>Not really. None, to be very precise. But I did buy yet another one: Mara van der Lugt&rsquo;s <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9780691265629/hopeful-pessimism">Hopeful Pessimism</a>, which sounded like it was written for me. I expect equally great and miserable things from this work.</p>
<h2 id="games-ive-played">Games I&rsquo;ve played</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only had the time to write the review for <a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/games/switch/rise-of-the-triad-ludicrous-edition/">Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition</a> (ROTT) that I ended up buying for the Nintendo Switch thanks to Limited Run Games&rsquo; stock overflow. It felt wonderfully weird to be playing a 1994 DOS cult classic on the Switch. And yes, the Ludicrous Edition is <em>ludicrous</em>. I finally made it past the third map! I&rsquo;m still feeling the retro shooter vibe and bought the <em>Turok Trilogy</em> on a whim after learning it was also done by Nightdive Studios.</p>
<p>Another smaller game I played in-between the ROTT sessions was <em>Shotgun King</em> that somehow manages to combine chess with shotguns, and very successfully so. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a bit of a bare bones roguelike, difficult as hell, and therefore not really my forte. I have yet to unlock all the shotguns. Don&rsquo;t buy the game on MacOS: GOG ended up refunding my purchase because it kept on crashing in the introduction cutscene. The Switch edition is fine.</p>
<p>Slightly game related: my wife sent me this YouTube video where Ghostfeeder explains how he uses the Game Boy to make music. I think that&rsquo;s worth sharing here:</p>

<li>Felienne Hermans <a href="https://www.felienne.nl/2025-11-25/">criticizes the AI Delta Plan</a> (in Dutch). We should stop proclaiming <em>build, build, build!</em> as the slogan of the future and start thinking about reduce &amp; re-use.</li>
<li>Hamilton shares his <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/2025-01_programming-language-tier-list">2025 programming language tier list</a>.

I don&rsquo;t agree with his reasoning at all (spoiler: it contains AI), but it&rsquo;s an interesting read nonetheless.</li>
