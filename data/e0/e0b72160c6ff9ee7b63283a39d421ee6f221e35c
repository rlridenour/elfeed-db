  <dt><a href="https://replay.software/sleeve">Sleeve 2 — Now playing on your Desktop</a></dt>
  <dd>Sleeve is my current top choice for displaying &ldquo;now playing&rdquo; information on my desktop, with a very customizable display, theme sharing, and last.fm scrobbling.</dd>
  <dd>
    <p>Side note: I found <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quietscrob-last-fm-scrobbler/id741599377">QuietScrob</a> to be pretty good for scrobbling Apple Music plays on the iPhone. I recently cancelled Spotify and am trying to make my way with Music now&hellip;</p>

  <dt><a href="https://mesoul.me/">MeSoul - Smart Journaling &amp; Self-Discovery App</a></dt>
  <dd>There are some benefits to this being web-based, and I like that the AI integration doesn&rsquo;t try to write for you, it just answers questions and improves long-term memory.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://www.bzgapps.com/quip">Quip – AI Clipboard Manager and Text Expander for macOS &amp; iOS</a></dt>
  <dd>I&rsquo;ve tested this out and it&rsquo;s pretty great. As a side note, there&rsquo;s a brand new app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stash-clipboard-shelf/id6752602271?mt=12">Stash</a> that functions more as an AI-powered <a href="https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/mac/">Yoink</a> that looks worth checking out (as is Yoink).</dd>
  <dd>
    <blockquote>

  <dt><a href="https://www.vibebackup.com/">Vibe Backup - Code Backup Tool for Vibe Coding Developers</a></dt>
  <dd>I&rsquo;m not a &ldquo;vibe coder,&rdquo; but I <em>have</em> been using AI to add some features to my apps. And given how quickly AI can make a mess and totally break things, constantly committing to your VCS is a must. This little app seeks to automate and make that process simpler. Features Shortcuts integration, Timeline management, and quick Rollback capabilities for secure code backup. $4.99 for the Pro version with no limits.</dd>
