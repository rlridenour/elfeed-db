<p>I don’t think there’s been any more effective advocate for the iPad over the years than Federico Viticci. Federico got an interview with Craig Federighi about the iPadOS changes. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/interview-craig-federighi-opens-up-about-ipados-its-multitasking-journey-and-the-ipads-essence/">It’s an excellent interview</a>. I think this new balance of adding power user features while still keeping the single window mode will (finally) turn out ot be the right fit for the iPad.</p>
