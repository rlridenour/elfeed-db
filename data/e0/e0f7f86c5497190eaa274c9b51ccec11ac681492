As always, there is more to come. In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-14/apple-pitches-a-return-to-design-roots-six-years-after-jony-ive-exit-2026-plan"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple plans to release many products in the "coming months."<br/>
<br/>
In late 2025 to early 2026, Gurman expects Apple to release 10 products, including an iPad Pro with an M5 chip "as early as October":<ul><li><strong>Apple TV:</strong> A faster <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/">A17 Pro chip</a> that will support next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/tim-cook-shares-personalized-siri-update/">revamped version of Siri</a> powered by Apple Intelligence, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">likely</a> Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-n1-chip/">N1 chip with Wi-Fi 7 support</a>. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">built-in FaceTime camera</a> has been rumored for a future Apple TV, but it is unclear if that will arrive with the next model specifically.</li><br/>
<li><strong>HomePod mini:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/homepod-mini-new-chip/">S9 chip or newer</a> with support for next year's revamped version of Siri powered by Apple Intelligence, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-custom-bluetooth-wifi-chip/">likely</a> Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-n1-chip/">N1 chip with Wi-Fi 7 support</a>, improved sound quality, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip for proximity features, and potentially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/05/new-homepod-mini-vision-pro-colors-rumored/">new color options like Red</a>.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>AirTag:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/airtag-2-longer-range-rumor/">Up to 3× longer item tracking range</a> vs. current AirTag, a more tamper-proof speaker, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/25/airtag-2-september-or-later-rumor/">"very low" battery life alerts</a>.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPad Pro:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">M5 chip</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/20/ipad-pro-two-front-cameras-rumor/">two front cameras</a>, allowing for photos and video calls in both portrait and landscape orientations.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Vision Pro:</strong> A faster <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/apple-vision-pro-2025-features/">M4 chip</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/apple-code-confirms-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">M5 chip</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/apple-vision-pro-2025-features/">a new head strap</a> that improves comfort, and potentially a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/05/new-homepod-mini-vision-pro-colors-rumored/">Space Black color option</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 17e:</strong> The successor to the iPhone 16e is expected to launch around March with the same A19 chip as in the iPhone 17.</li><br/>
<li><strong>MacBook Pro:</strong> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/macbook-pro-with-m5-chips-2026-rumor/">Multiple</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/10/no-m5-macbook-pro-2025/">sources</a>, including Gurman, have indicated that MacBook Pro models with the M5 series of chips might not launch until early 2026, and it is unclear if any other Macs with M5 chips like an iMac or Mac mini would debut this year as a result. Perhaps we will see another MacBook Pro announcement <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-announces-m2-pro-macbook-pro/">in January</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>MacBook Air:</strong> New models with the M5 chip are expected in the first quarter of 2026.</li><br/>
  <li><strong>Studio Display:</strong> A new version of the Studio Display with mini-LED backlighting is expected to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/studio-display-2-rumor-recap/">in late 2025 or early 2026</a>. If no new Macs launch this year, then early 2026 is the more likely timeframe.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple Home Hub:</strong> Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/15/the-macrumors-show-apple-smart-home-plan/">long-rumored smart home hub</a> is expected to be announced around March next year.</li></ul>Gurman's list did not mention the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/lower-cost-macbook-rumor/">rumored lower-priced MacBook with an A18 Pro chip</a>, which will launch in late 2025 to early 2026, according to previous reports.<br/>
<br/>
It is not yet known if Apple plans to host another special event this year, or if these products would be announced with press releases on the Apple Newsroom website only. If the M5 chip debuts in 2025, then it is likely that Apple would host an event, as the M1 chip through to the M4 chip were all unveiled during events.<br/>
