<p>Matt Emerson opened the conference keynote talk on Clozure CL. He also touched on using and celebrating CL. It provided a jolt of enthusiasm and positivity to kick off a fun conference. And it made me want to use Clozure CL more often and learn how to effectively hack on and with it.</p><p>Nicolas Hafner’s talk on shaders was interesting, but partway through the talk he revealed that the slideshow system itself was an interactive Common Lisp program. Along with standard slideshow behavior, it displayed and animated the classic teapot, with interactive recompilation and redisplay of the shaders.</p><p>Ethan Schwartz’s talk on Google’s tweaks to SBCL’s GC was a reminder that you don’t have to settle for the system-provided customization knobs. When source is available and you’re willing to customize very specifically for your application’s workload, you can get nice improvements.</p><p>(Also his passing mention of Docker inspired me to work on a Docker image with all the Quicklisp-required foreign libraries baked into it. I think it will be helpful to me for easier testing, and maybe distributed builds. It should be helpful to others for testing everything in Quicklisp without the pain of gathering all the build requirements for its many projects.)</p><p>You should check out Douglas Katzman’s lightning talk, “Self-modifying code (for fun and profit)”. He’s added a neat thing in SBCL where the system can be disassembled completely and reassembled into a new binary with various bits of optimization or instrumentation. <br/></p><p>There were many other great talks and discussions!</p><p>It’s rejuvenating to hear about all the cool things people are working on. There’s stuff people are making that you might make use of in your own projects, or inspiration to hack your own things to share with others.</p><p>Also: great weather, great city, fun excursion to Ronda, seeing old friends from past conferences, meeting new friends, putting online names to real-life faces, hearing directly from people who use Quicklisp. And Dmitri Fontaine told me about <a href="https://tic.computer" style="font-size: 14px;">tic80</a>, which my kid and I used to make a retro game in just a few days.<br/></p><p>Next ELS conference is in Genova, Italy on April 1, 2019. Start planning today, and I’ll see you there!</p>
