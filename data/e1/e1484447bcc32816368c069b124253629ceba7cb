<p><a href="http://isync.sourceforge.net/">Mbsync</a> and <a href="https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html">mu4e</a> are great for syncing and handling IMAP email. I've now migrated 4 email addresses, including an old Yahoo account.</p>
<p>I wanted to mark all my Yahoo unread emails as read. Yahoo's webmail enables marking 500 emails at a time, making the process a little tedious.</p>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mu-discuss">Mu-discuss</a> has a handy <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mu-discuss/zaA394sH1Ow/QSVPXS22BQAJ">thread</a>, highlighting that moving/renaming synced messages (in your local file system) would do the job. This worked well for me.</p>
<p>Let's do just that…</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Copy a small sample of your mails to a separate directory and run some trials until you feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Find your mail directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">cd path/to/mail
</code></pre>
<p>Peek at the messages you'd like to mark unread:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">ls -1 new/
</code></pre>
<p>Rename message files by appending &quot;S&quot; to their filename and moving from new/ to cur/ directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">for FILE in new/*; do mv &quot;${FILE}&quot; cur/$(basename &quot;${FILE}&quot;)S; done;
</code></pre>
<p>We can verify the move.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">ls -1 cur/
</code></pre>
<p>Let's sync the local changes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">mbsync -Va
</code></pre>
<p>…and we're done ;)</p>
