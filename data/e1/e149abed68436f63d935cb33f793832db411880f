<p>Tim Hardwick, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the first time, every model in Apple’s latest flagship iPhone
17 lineup features a base 256GB storage capacity, up from the
lowest 128GB option in the iPhone 16 series. The regular iPhone 17
now comes in 256GB and 512GB storage options, while the all-new
ultra-thin iPhone Air and the iPhone 17 Pro come in 256GB, 512GB,
and 1TB capacities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is offered in the same three
capacities as the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro, but with the
addition of a maximum 2TB option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know it’s been 18 years, but it’s kind of wild to compare today’s storage tiers to the original iPhone’s 4, 8, and 16 GB options.</p>
