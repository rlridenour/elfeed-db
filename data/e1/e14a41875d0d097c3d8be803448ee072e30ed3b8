<p>President Trump on Friday asked Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice to investigate alleged ties between the late Jeffrey Epstein and prominent figures and institutions, including former president Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase, Larry Summers and Reid Hoffman. The request followed the release this week of a large trove of Epstein-era documents and emails that renewed scrutiny of many high‑profile social and business connections. The Justice Department said it would fulfil the president&#x27;s request, a move that Democrats say is intended to shift attention from questions about Mr Trump’s own past ties to Epstein.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/bzIbPT0pL4oefqYuxIuu5nl35BjQa1tutt8IQmb7azBHlZPLTUHS3F-qLULt7IWpCvmrz4VVT3ApH2w-CzaiiK5iLd5lY5oc-D-a2A524zm3' alt='US President Donald Trump speaks at the White House on November 13, 2025 — Reuters' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>DoJ assignment: Attorney General Pam Bondi has assigned the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton, to take the lead on the investigation, the AG’s office signalled in public comments.</li><li>Bank settlement: JPMorgan Chase previously agreed in 2023 to pay about $290 million to settle claims by Epstein victims, a fact raised by reporting as part of scrutiny of his financial ties.</li><li>Public reaction poll: A recent poll cited by reporting found roughly four in 10 Republicans approved of Mr Trump’s handling of the Epstein files, indicating mixed support within his party.</li><li>Clinton&#x27;s past statements: Bill Clinton has said he &#x27;had no inkling&#x27; of Epstein’s crimes and accounts note he flew on Epstein’s plane in earlier years, though he has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing in the scandal.</li></ul><blockquote>I will be asking AG Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, JP Morgan, Chase and many other people and institutions - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: Mr Trump framed the request as exposing what he called an &#x27;Epstein Hoax&#x27; used by Democrats to deflect from political issues, and named specific Democrats and institutions he wanted investigated.
