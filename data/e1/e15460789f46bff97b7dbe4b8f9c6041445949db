I saw this snippet in a 2016 interview in Psychology Today with T. Berry
Brazelton:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“BB: I've just finished writing a book, The Final Touchpoint I'd like to
get that out there. There are better and worse ways to handle our aging,
our denial of it, our acceptance, and&#x2014;as Erik Erikson put it&#x2014;our
being generative, to produce as much as we can while we can. I'm 98 but
I'm still trying to be generative.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He died two years after the interview and I don't think The Final
Touchpoint has been published, but it might be interesting to find
similar books.

Hmm, an On This Day RSS feed might be worth writing a tiny script that I
can add to a crontab.
</p>

<p>
“Naturally there's an On This Day web feed too so these posts appear in
my newsreader each morning. Some personal serendipity to start the day.”

On the value of legible source code for websites, especially personal
ones:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Today's heavily optimized websites have largely killed the "view
source" learning experience. The code is minified, bundled, and often
incomprehensible to beginners trying to understand how things work.<br>
I got the ick from my own small optimisation. My personal website is
small and it isn't an urgent service. It's hardly ever visited from a
mobile phone. Maybe I shouldn't be using the little time I have to focus
on that side of front-end development in this instance?<br>
But deep down, all I want for my personal website is to give back to the
web. I want anyone, regardless of skill level, to inspect elements,
understand the structure, and learn from readable code. And I am fully
aware my code isn't perfect. It's old and there's a lot of room for
improvement.”

Homework experiments continue. So far, we have determined that homework
is more likely to be done if the kiddo is on top of me (2 instances) or
if she's dictating answers while eating lunch (1 instance) or playing
Minecraft (1 instance).</li>
