<p>You’ll never guess what cohosts Andru Edwards and Jon Rettinger talked to me about on their Geared Up podcast this week. OK, fine, you guessed <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">it</a>. But I bet you didn’t guess that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2008/02/news_flash_no_flash">Flash on iPhone</a> came up. Very fun show — I think you’ll enjoy it.</p>
