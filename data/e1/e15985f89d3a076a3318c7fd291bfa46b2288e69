<p>My thanks to <a href="https://www.turbulenceforecast.com">Turbulence Forecast</a> for sponsoring Six Colors this week. Whether you want to keep your nerves in check, are flying with kids, or even want to know the best time to get out of your airline seat for a dash to the bathroom, Turbulence Forecast is the easiest way to know in advance just how smooth or bumpy your next flight is going to be.</p>
<p>This is a weather app of a different kind, charting your flight routes and sending you a detailed PDF with multiple maps, with updates pushed right to your phone. You’ll see exactly where it might get bumpy and where it should stay nice and smooth, up to five days ahead, with regular updates as the weather changes.</p>
<p>Turbulence Forecast can see out as far as five days, making it easier to pick a calmer day if your plans are flexible. They’re even <a href="https://www.turbulenceforecast.com/drift">tracking their forecast stats</a> so you can see how steady their predictions have been over time.</p>
<p>And if you want a personal touch? Turbulence Forecast offers a Handcrafted Forecast — where the founder, who’s been doing this for 20 years, personally looks at your flight, answers your questions, and even suggests smoother options if you’ve got some wiggle room. (Bonus, he’s a huge Six Colors fan.)</p>
<p>Fly smarter, and <em>much</em> smoother, with Turbulence Forecast, available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id486438834?pt=697513&amp;ct=sixColors&amp;mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.turbulenceforecast.android">Android</a> as well as at <a href="https://turbulenceforecast.com">turbulenceforecast.com</a>.</p>
