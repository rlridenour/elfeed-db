After launching new iPhones last month, Apple is <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/">promoting iCloud+</a> with a prominent banner on its home page, in a bid to boost its services revenue. In addition to more storage, all iCloud+ plans include five perks for iPhone users.<br/>

As a refresher, iCloud includes 5GB of storage for free. If you want extra storage, you need to subscribe to an iCloud+ plan. In the United States, prices range from &#36;0.99 per month for 50GB of storage to &#36;59.99 per month for 12TB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the five perks included with all iCloud+ plans:<ul><li><strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102602">Private Relay</a></strong> keeps your Safari browsing history entirely private from network providers, websites, and even Apple.</li><br/>
