<p>&#8220;Harvard University Press published 142 new titles in the fall of 2016. Last fall, it put out just 26.&#8221;<span id="more-53750"></span></p>
<p>And &#8220;revenue from new books — the &#8216;frontlist&#8217; — declined by half since 2018.&#8221;</p>
<p>These figures are from a lengthy investigative <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/5/2/harvard-university-press-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> published at <em>The Harvard Crimson </em>about <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard University Press</a> (HUP).</p>
<p>What explains the drop?</p>
<p>Reporters William C. Mao and Veronica H. Paulus write:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>In September 2017, George T. Andreou ’87 became the director of HUP. Since then, press staff alleged — in interviews with The Crimson, union surveys, and letters to Harvard administrators — that he has belittled HUP employees to their peers, instilled a fear of retaliation and layoffs, and mismanaged the publishing house.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>That environment has caused an exodus of talent, staff say. Since 2018,<strong> </strong>at least 50 employees have left the press — and, in interviews and in letters obtained by The Crimson, several cited Andreou’s leadership as a key catalyst for their departures&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“I have never in my professional life in trade publishing experienced the kind of abusive, egotistical and unprofessional behavior that I have seen consistently over the course of the last two and a half years,” a former editor wrote in a 2020 letter to </em>[then-provost Alan]<em> Garber that called for Andreou’s removal.</em></p>
<p>The reporters note that circa 2020 decline in output &#8220;was not unusual among academic presses as the Covid-19 pandemic hit.&#8221; Still, &#8220;university presses at some peer schools, however, recovered from their pandemic-related dips in output after several months. HUP did not. Instead, its publishing numbers fell precipitously over the next several years,&#8221; as you can see on the following graph:</p>
