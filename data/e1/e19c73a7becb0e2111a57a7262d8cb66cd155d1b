<p><a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>’s initial selling point was the frictionless creation of new events. Although they’ve added many new features since then, Fantastical hasn’t lost touch with its roots.</p>



<p>You can now forward an email containing an event to Fantastical (email@fantastical.app) from your Flexibits account email and Fantastical’s AI will, on the back end, parse the email and add the event to your calendar. Clever.</p>



<p>Calendar management is one area ripe for AI assistance, and I hope this is just the beginning for Fantastical.</p>



<p>Another Fantastical update that has been a game changer for me is adding multiple window support for your Mac. So now I can leave my big monthly calendar as a full-screen app, while still having a movable/resizable calendar with my favorite calendar app.</p>
