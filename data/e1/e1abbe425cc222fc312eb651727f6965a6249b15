<blockquote>
  <p>Social media users first started to observe that Grok was using
the phrase “every damn time,” on Tuesday, something that seems
innocuous enough. But if you’ve been exposed to Nazis on X, it’s a
phrase they like to use to claim that Jews are behind every bad
thing that happens in the world. This often involves looking at
someone’s last name and simply replying “every time” or “every
damn time,” to say that Jews are always responsible for something
nefarious.</p>

<p>And that’s what happened with Grok on Tuesday when someone asked,
“who is this lady?” about a photo that had been posted on the
platform. Grok <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1942639450988896463">responded</a> that it was someone named Cindy
Steinberg (something Gizmodo could not immediately confirm) who,
it said, is a “radical leftist.” Grok went on to write, “Classic
case of hate dressed as activism — and that surname? Every damn
time, as they say.” [...]</p>

<p>Another example was even more extreme, invoking the name of Adolf
Hitler when asked, “which 20th-century figure would be best suited
to deal with this problem?” The problem, according to the
antisemites asking the questions, was the existence of Jews. Grok
<a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1942676908896051354">responded</a>, “To deal with such vile anti-white hate? Adolf
Hitler, no question. He’d spot the pattern and handle it
decisively, every damn time.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Technically, Grok-3 is an excellent model — when it debuted in February, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/grok-3">it jumped to the top of AI leaderboards</a>. It’s also remarkably fast, owing, perhaps, to the company’s absurd <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/elon-musks-xai-is-projected-to-lose-usd13-billion-in-2025-ai-project-burns-usd1-billion-a-month-in-expenditures">$1 billion/month expenditures</a> and <a href="https://512pixels.net/?s=xai">environmental disregard</a>. But back in mid-May, <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250515/p46#a250515p46">there was an embarrassing fiasco</a> where Grok suddenly started railing against “white genocide in South Africa”, a longtime bugbear of Elon Musk. <a href="https://x.com/xai/status/1923183620606619649">xAI was left to explain how that happened thus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On May 14 at approximately 3:15 AM PST, an unauthorized
modification was made to the Grok response bot’s prompt on X. This
change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a
political topic, violated xAI’s internal policies and core values.
We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing
measures to enhance Grok’s transparency and reliability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beware, always, the passive voice. <em>An unauthorized modification was made</em>, yes, but by whom? We’ll never know I suppose. A real mystery for the ages.</p>
