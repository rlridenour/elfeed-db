  <p>I was looking at the NFC standings yesterday, particularly the NFC North, the Chicago Bears’ division. The hated Packers are at the top of the division with a 4-1-1 record and a winning percentage of .750.</p>

<p>How does a 4-1-1 record turn into .750? I guess the obvious answer is that the tie is treated as half a win and</p>
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>½</mn></mrow><mn>6</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>.750</mn></math>
<p>But for some reason, my initial thought was more complicated. I thought of it as the weighted average of the winning percentage of non-ties with the winning percentage of ties:</p>
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>5</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac><mspace width="0.167em"></mspace><mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>.800</mn><mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac><mspace width="0.167em"></mspace><mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>.500</mn><mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>.750</mn></math>
<p>(There may be a philosophical argument as to whether a tie truly constitutes a .500 winning percentage, but I’m just going to accept it as a given.)</p>
<p>The calculation works out the same, of course, because</p>
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>5</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac><mspace width="0.167em"></mspace><mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>.800</mn><mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac><mspace width="0.167em"></mspace><mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>.500</mn><mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mspace width="0.167em"></mspace><mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>.800</mn><mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mspace width="0.167em"></mspace><mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>.500</mn><mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mn>6</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>½</mi></mrow><mn>6</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>.750</mn></math>
<p>I think this says something about me and my tendency to overcomplicate things. On the other hand, it’s always nice to be able to work out a solution in more than one way.</p>
<p>If you find that referring to numbers like .750, .800, and .500 as “percentages” a tiny bit off-putting, you’re my kind of people. But it’s common in sports to divide one number by another and call it a percentage—a tribute to the elasticity of language.</p>
<p>Two other common features of sports percentages:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are always (?) written to three decimal places. I think this was arrived at through experience—enough digits to distinguish close races but not enough to waste space.</li>
<li>They are always spoken as if the decimal point isn’t there. The examples above are “seven-fifty,” “eight hundred,” and “five hundred.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Baseball also uses “average” to express one number divided by another: <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/batting-average">batting average</a> and <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/earned-run-average">earned run average</a> come to mind. But it also has the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/slugging-percentage">slugging percentage</a>, which isn’t remotely like a percentage.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of “modulus,” mainly because of its many uses in engineering mechanics, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%27s_modulus">Young’s modulus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_modulus">bulk modulus</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_modulus">section modulus</a>. But I don’t expect to see it on ESPN anytime soon.</p>
