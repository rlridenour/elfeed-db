An invitation was <a href="https://x.com/JHawkShoots/status/1975989937335050296">shared on X (Twitter)</a> by photographer Johnny Hawk, featuring a simple message: "Hi Johnny. We're so excited to welcome you to Colorado. Please enjoy this bag of essentials to use during your time here. See you soon!" The card is accompanied by a black backpack emblazoned with Apple's logo and a white flask.<br/>

When news of the mysterious Colorado gathering first surfaced, there was some speculation online that it might relate to Apple's anticipated October product refresh, which is expected to include new iPad Pro models with M5 chips and an updated Vision Pro, with potentially other updates also coming. Apparently, that's not the case at all.<br/>

The Rocky Mountain gathering appears to be just another aspect of Apple's marketing campaign for its been-and-gone iPhone 17 fall event.
