<p>A new Global Carbon Project assessment projects global CO2 emissions from burning coal, oil and gas will reach about 38.1 billion metric tons in 2025, a record and roughly 1.1% higher than 2024 levels. The group’s 20th annual global carbon cycle analysis, released alongside a 2025 full-year projection, warns that the increase makes keeping warming to 1.5°C effectively out of reach and raises urgency at this week’s COP30 summit. The report notes uneven changes by country — the United States is projected to see a 1.9% rise in emissions while China’s emissions are expected to grow modestly after years of decline tied to heavy renewable investment.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/WSaOrj7jgtx8InTHWT7jnU1L8PM__qccq2aKkscn5g5LQDY9JlsvUnIHmyjz4w2PVPZ-dslxo3a8uWwT1Il0aI-FZXMwCVeR0ioULkaHCtwquBkqGs67Ulj28btFxl2yOmGvd4NxPNFR-sGwEJr7xPpKl3F_mnKhuj1DWziw6-wxjA4ge0F9-E8WLbmA4i2t1J2G-YCvNKQxfBo76z5m7QwtZKhCHCOaOFM' alt='A coal-fired power plant in Candiota, in southeastern Brazil.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Report milestone: The assessment is the Global Carbon Project’s 20th annual global carbon cycle analysis and includes a modeled full-year projection for 2025 released in the journal Earth System Science Data.</li><li>Cement included: The emissions tally counts CO2 from burning fossil fuels and from cement manufacture, with cement singled out as one of the largest non-energy contributors to the total.</li><li>COP30 backdrop: The study was published amid negotiators’ talks at COP30 in Brazil, adding pressure on delegates as the report indicates current policies will not keep warming below 1.5°C.</li><li>Renewables vs demand: Despite rapid growth in renewable energy capacity, rising global energy demand has driven increased oil, gas and coal emissions in 2025 projections, underscoring a gap between cleaner supply and overall consumption growth.</li></ul><blockquote>We have to have emissions of CO2 declining every single year over the next 20 to 30 years if we want to leave warming below two degrees - Pierre Friedlingstein</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Global Carbon Project / lead researcher: The annual assessment projects a record in fossil fuel CO2 for 2025 and stresses that sustained year-on-year declines are required to meet long-term temperature goals.
