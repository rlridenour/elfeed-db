<p>Israel’s military chief of staff, Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, has ordered the dismissal or disciplining of about a dozen senior officers for their roles in what the army calls a systemic failure to prevent and respond to Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel from Gaza. Those affected include former heads of the intelligence and operations directorates and the former commander of the Southern Command, who had already stepped down from active posts but will now also be removed from reserve roles, while others received formal reprimands or were told their service would end. Zamir said the army failed in its primary mission to protect Israeli civilians and described the shortcomings as severe and wide‑ranging, adding that lessons from that day would guide future reforms in the Israel Defense Forces. The disciplinary steps come amid mounting public pressure in Israel for a full state commission of inquiry into the attack and the subsequent war in Gaza, which the Israeli government has not yet formally launched.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/D_8Z5EeNpEdsntFDELgPu-UohigR-5fPa0-Ab5EUgVHHYfG34KZ1m7HDK90HWnaphiKZIAU56E2Tsfs9tzReDwaWNxLSX-uaya6XVTAGj5nYsXM_wdoIZpVBaEy_2F97z25Sylhbne3dF63Z4vQqKvE4mwuWyBOGKs1r-2VVJ9omC2VyNME_K-QvzJm-wttAeBi5lxogH5iORjkv' alt='Israeli military chief of staff Lt.
