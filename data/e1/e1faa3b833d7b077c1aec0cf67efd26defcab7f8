<p>Projectile is great Emacs package you definitely have to install if you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Along with projects management and quick switching among of them it allows you to limit grep/ack, find files and replacing commands.
Here I want to note how to quickly search and replace strings in your project.</p>
<h2 id="search-grepackag">Search (grep/ack/ag)</h2>
<p>If you know basics of <code>grep</code> you shouldn&rsquo;t get any issues with it. Just call <code>projectile-grep</code> interactive function
and type the query.</p>
<p>Here is how it works on this blog with <code>title:</code> query:</p>

<p>As you can see there is new buffer created called <code>*grep*</code>. At the bottom it says that search is finished (<code>:exit</code>) and have matches (<code>[matched]</code>).
Filenames are links, so you can click on them and file will be opened in new buffer on the matched line.</p>
<h2 id="replace">Replace</h2>
<p>Projectile is also really great in replacing with its <code>projectile-replace</code> and <code>projectile-replace-regexp</code>.
When you call one of those functions you will be asked for an input to search for.
Let&rsquo;s search the blog for <code>Replace</code>.
When you typed the query, you need to input the string you want to replace on. Let&rsquo;s replace our <code>Replace</code> with <code>Find</code>.</p>
<p>When both params are entered the buffer with first match will be opened.</p>
<p>You can see the info in the mini-buffer:</p>

<p>Now you can press some keys to perform actions.
Press <code>?</code> for help.</p>

<p>As you can see if you click <code>y</code> button then the replace action will be performed. If you see something wrong is going to be replaced just press <code>n</code> button to skip the
currently highlighted match and Emacs will switch to the next match.</p>
<p>Searching and replacing should be used as often as possible with minimum of manual work. It will save you from mistakes and improve your productivity a lot.</p>
<p>Good luck &lt;3</p>
