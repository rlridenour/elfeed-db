<p>Canada and China announced a deal in Beijing on Friday to roll back trade barriers, including Canada lowering its tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles and China reducing tariffs on Canadian canola products. Prime Minister Mark Carney, on the first visit to China by a Canadian prime minister in years, presented the move as part of Canada’s effort to broaden export markets and reduce dependence on the United States. The agreement also highlights a wider trend of countries pursuing new trade arrangements as they adjust to a more protectionist posture from Washington under President Trump, according to reporting and analysis in several outlets.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/kQpsaej5vm9JUsHkCZku9iXIWSV0CLXu8K2ytrMvMGTzpZ8iZ_LLj6RFMZIet9GmaJ8g4WcdztUgX8VGPG9b54e1T7OIve3PfXa7snygdgIBWXzitcxxN7ZLWFkvecf4dW296CvbFD7abFXg5LWdsJqle-9Yj812OZMB3Z6DoEvgpotkEkz0_yRx34h-86vAwep_Xt1G' alt='Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada meeting with Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>EV import cap: RT reported Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles to enter under a reduced tariff as part of the initial arrangement.</li><li>Tariff levels differ: Accounts varied on the exact new Canadian tariff rate on Chinese EVs, with Al Jazeera citing 15% and RT citing 6.1% in their reporting.</li><li>Strained ties context: Several outlets framed the announcement as a reset after years of strain in the bilateral relationship, with the Financial Times noting it followed a period of dispute and the first Canadian leader visit to Beijing in nearly a decade.</li><li>US warning: US officials criticized Ottawa’s move, with Al Jazeera reporting Washington said Canada would “regret” opening its market to Chinese EVs.</li><li>Wider realignment: Semafor pointed to other trade moves alongside Canada’s talks—such as Kenya’s preliminary agreement for broad duty-free access to China and progress in EU-India negotiations—as signs of diversification away from the US.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Canadian government (Prime Minister Mark Carney): Carney described the agreement as a pragmatic step to expand Canada’s trade options and said improved relations could help strengthen a global governance system he argued is under strain.
