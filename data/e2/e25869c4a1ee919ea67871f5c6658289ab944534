If you listen to audio using <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all/beats-featured">Beats</a> or <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/">AirPods</a> when going to bed, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> has a useful new feature for you. The update adds a "Pause Media When Falling Asleep" option that is designed to shut off your earbuds when you're no longer awake to listen.<br/>

Apple mentioned the feature during its Worldwide Developers Conference, but it was highlighted as an AirPods feature. Code discovered by <a href="https://x.com/SteveMoser"><em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser</a> suggests that the option is also available for Beats headphones.<br/>
<br/>
The option to pause audio when asleep will save your spot in an audiobook or a podcast, but it should also preserve battery life by preventing your earbuds from staying on all night.<br/>
<br/>
Pausing audio should be on by default when you install &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, but it can be enabled by connecting your headphones to your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and then tapping on them in the Settings app. Apple has not explained how the Beats or AirPods detect that you've fallen asleep.<br/>
<br/>
You'll need &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; to use the option, plus updated firmware that Apple is beta testing. &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is limited to developers, but a public beta is coming soon. The update will launch this September.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/01/beats-airpods-sleep-pause-ios-26/">Beats and AirPods Headphones Shut Off When You Fall Asleep in iOS 26</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-and-airpods-headphones-shut-off-when-you-fall-asleep-in-ios-26.2460016/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
