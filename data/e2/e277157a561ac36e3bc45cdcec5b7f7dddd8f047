<p>In the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080720221038/http://home.pacific.net.au/~bangsund/muphry.htm">March 1992 newsletter</a> of Australia&#8217;s Society of Editors, John Bangsund offered a rule that he called Muphry&#8217;s Law:</p>
<p>(a) if you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading, there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written;<br />
(b) if an author thanks you in a book for your editing or proofreading, there will be mistakes in the book;<br />
(c) the stronger the sentiment expressed in (a) and (b), the greater the fault;<br />
(d) any book devoted to editing or style will be internally inconsistent.</p>
<p>In November 2003, the <em>Canberra Editor</em> noted, &#8220;Muphry&#8217;s Law also dictates that, if a mistake is as plain as the nose on your face, everyone can see it but you. Your readers will always notice errors in a title, in headings, in the first paragraph of anything, and in the top lines of a new page. These are the very places where authors, editors and proofreaders are most likely to make mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier, editor Joseph A. Umhoefer had observed that &#8220;Articles on writing are themselves badly written.&#8221; A correspondent wrote that Umhoefer &#8220;was probably the first to phrase it so publicly; however, many others must have thought of it long ago.&#8221;</p>
