<p>Little oil studies of elderly folk. I seem to be quite drawn to studying older faces. Cracks and wrinkles, a gnarlier texture seems more absorbing to me. These painting are no more than 5 or so inches tall and intended to be quick studies I don&rsquo;t spend <em>too</em> much time over. It&rsquo;s kinda nice to have a sheet of little studies..when you get stuck on one or need to wait for something to dry you can jump across to another and keep engaged with painting. my other intention was to practice colour and mixing. I wouldn&rsquo;t put these paintings on a wall or anything - just good practice.</p>
