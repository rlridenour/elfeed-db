Apple today announced its "Awe Dropping" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">iPhone-centric event</a>, which is set to take place on Tuesday, September 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. There are a long list of products that are coming, but we thought we'd pull out five feature highlights to look forward to.<br/>

<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>That Super Thin iPhone</strong> - Apple's September 9 event will see the unveiling of the first redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> we've had in years, with Apple set to introduce an ultra thin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>. We don't know the name of the device just yet, but "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>" makes sense given Apple's other product names. It should be around 5.5mm thick, which will make it the thinnest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date. It's not without compromises, though, so it'll only have a single-lens camera and battery life could be shorter than expected.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Satellite for the Wrist</strong> - The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is rumored to include satellite connectivity, allowing wearers to get help in an emergency using a satellite connection in remote areas where Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity are unavailable. Unfortunately, it sounds like it's going to be an Ultra only feature, so don't expect it for the Apple Watch Series 11.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>AirPods Heart Rate</strong> - Apple is finally refreshing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, and along with improved Active Noise Cancellation, better sound, and a refined design, rumors suggest that the AirPods will get in-ear heart rate tracking, much like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a> 2.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>New "Pro" Camera Design</strong> - The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; is going to be the star of the event, but Apple is redesigning the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models too. There's a new pill-shaped camera bump that's much bigger than before, plus we're expecting a more durable build for the back that primarily uses aluminum instead of glass. It's not quite clear why the cameras are changing, but there are rumors of a 48-megapixel Telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Colors, Cases, Lanyards and More</strong> - Apple usually chooses muted colors for the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models, but this year we're getting some shade of orange. It might be more copper than orange, but still, it's sounding like it might be a little brighter than Apple's typical safe color choices. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will come in a light blue, and there are some interesting case rumors too. Apple is supposedly introducing new "TechWoven" fabric cases to replace the ill-fated FineWoven cases everyone hated, and it looks like Apple's case lineup is going to get little cutouts to support straps and lanyards.</li><br/>
