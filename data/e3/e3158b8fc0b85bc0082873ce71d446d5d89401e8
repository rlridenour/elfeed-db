<p>In his lifetime, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a> had only one successful art show. It took place at the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York in November 1949, and afterward, his fellow abstract expressionist <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/3213-willem-de-kooning" rel="nofollow">Willem de Kooning</a> declared that “Jackson has finally broken the ice.” Perhaps, according to Louis Menand’s book <a href="https://amzn.to/3TnNTxI"><em>The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold War</em></a>, he meant that “Pollock was the first American abstractionist to break into the mainstream art world, or he might have meant that Pollock had broken through a stylistic logjam that American painters felt blocked by.” Whatever its intent, de Kooning’s remark annoyed art critic and major Pollock advocate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Greenberg">Clement Greenberg</a>, who “thought that it reduced Pollock to a transitional figure.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t necessarily a reduction: as Menand sees it, “all figures are transitional. Not every figure, however, is a hinge, someone who represents a moment when one mode of practice swings over to another.” Pollock was such a hinge, as, in his way, was Greenberg: “After Pollock, people painted differently. After Greenberg, people thought about painting differently.”</p>

<p>When they made their mark, “there was no going back.” Gallerist-YouTuber James Payne examines the nature of that mark in <a href="https://youtu.be/0sQ_cfZ8q9k">the new Great Art Explained video above</a>, the first of a multi-part series on Pollock’s art and the figures that made its cultural impact possible. Even more important than Greenberg, in Payne’s telling, is Pollock’s fellow artist — and, in time, wife — <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/3240-lee-krasner" rel="nofollow">Lee Krasner</a>, whose own work he also gives its due.</p>
<p>We also see the paintings of American regionalist Thomas Hart Benton, Pollock’s teacher; Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, in whose workshop Pollock participated; and even Pablo Picasso, who exerted subtle but detectable influences of his own on Pollock’s work. Other, non-artistic sources of inspiration Payne explores include the psychological theory of Carl Gustav Jung, with whose school of therapy Pollock engaged in the late nineteen-thirties and early forties. It was in those sessions that he produced the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/485157">“psychoanalytic drawings,”</a> one of several categories of Pollock’s work that will surprise those who know him only through his large-canvas, wholly abstract drip paintings. Each represents one stage of a complex evolutionary process: Pollock may have been the ideal artist for the new, post-war American world, but he hardly came fully formed out of Wyoming.</p>
