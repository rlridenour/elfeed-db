A few weeks ago I mentioned that <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13068">Sacha Chua is tremendously organized and gave an example of that organization</a>. That example was about how she automated organizing tasks based on her calendar. Now she provides us with another example.
</p>
<p>
This time, <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/07/emacs-open-urls-or-search-the-web-plus-browse-url-handlers/">she provides a shortcut for dealing with the thing at point</a>. Someone asked her for a way of either opening the URL at point or searching for the word or region if the point wasn&rsquo;t on a URL. Chua, of course, not only ran with that but expanded it to be even more useful. She presents code that deals with whatever the point is on in the following way:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unless there is an active region, assume that the thing at point is a URL, word, an email address, or a filename. If it <i>is</i> a region, just add the text for processing as below</li>
<li>If there are links, open them</li>
<li>If there are email addresses open an email compose buffer with those addresses populating the &ldquo;TO:&rdquo; header</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a filename, open it</li>
<li>Otherwise do a Web search on the word or text from the region</li>
</ul>
<p>
Chua also describes some nice customizations. You can specify what function to call for searching. This is more than just picking your browser of choice. See Chua&rsquo;s post for the details. This can even be fine grained. You might want to use different &ldquo;browsing functions&rdquo; depending on what kind of link it is. Again, see the post for details.
</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s not really enough code involved to make it into a package but if you&rsquo;re interested, it would be easy to just add Chua&rsquo;s code to your <code>init.el</code>.</p>
