<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Taking inventory of machines in my possession and then thinking through a personal move from #Macos to #Linux.
</p>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I became the steward of a trove of old Windows laptops and a Chromebook.  And
I’m looking to breath some life into those laptops by installing <span><a href="https://linux.org/">Linux</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Linux”" title="Other site-wide references of “Linux”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-LINUX">&#128214;</a></small>
.  With
this trove of laptops, if I’m going to make them useful, I need to “use”
them.<small class="side-container">

  <span class="side" role="note"> What do I consider useful?  Finding folks needing a computering environment,
and making it available.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>There is a part of me that simply wants to send out a message asking folks if
they want one of these computers.  But I’m also curious about how I can provide
a level of support for folks less computer inclined, who still need computers.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-04-15" title="2025-04-15">This evening</time>, I created a live boot image of <span><a href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Debian”" title="Other site-wide references of “Debian”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-DEBIAN">&#128214;</a></small>
 and <span><a href="https://xfce.org/">Xfce</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Xfce”" title="Other site-wide references of “Xfce”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-XFCE">&#128214;</a></small>
 on a thumb drive
and took inventory of each of the computers; at least the cooperative ones.  We
don’t need all of these computers, but I need to get them in a good “here you
go” state.</p>
<p>There’s likely unmet computering needs in my neighborhood that I might help
address.</p>
<h2 id="to-leave-a-walled-garden">To Leave a Walled Garden</h2>
<p>I have also been considering a shift to Linux; away from the walled garden of
proprietary operating systems.</p>
<p>I’ve experimented with using <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM on my Mac</a>, but kept hitting on display
problems; and a little critter in my head saying “I don’t want to run an OS in a
virtualized yet walled environment.”</p>
<p>Which leads me to exploring replacing my current daily driver, a <time datetime="2021" title="2021">2021</time> 13” M1
Macbook Air.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> <dfn>Daily driver</dfn> being the thing that I use on a daily basis for a
specific task; in this case computering.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
 This Macbook Air is an absolute joy to use and is in great
shape.  And I have a significant number of stickers on it.</p>
<p>Yet, before I commit to a path, albeit one that is reversible, I want to know my
migration strategy.  Namely what are the functional needs and desires that I
have.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>I’m looking at a similar approach as what I took when I stopped using the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(text_editor)">Atom</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Atom”" title="Other site-wide references of “Atom”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ATOM">&#128214;</a></small>

text editor and eventually settled on <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
.  Namely to determine the
fundamentals of my computering environment; and have a plan to implement those
in short-order.</p>
<h3 id="first-order-applications">First Order Applications</h3>
<p>First, I took an inventory of the first-order applications I regularly use.
What do I consider a first-order application?  One that directly accomplishes a
computering task I set out to do (e.g. search the web; compose an email; write
in my journal; etc.)</p>
<p>As I looked through my Application directory, I found 3:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Emacs</span>
, I can almost get by with this as my only first-order application.</li>
<li>A “rich” web browser (e.g. <span><a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “LibreWolf”" title="Other site-wide references of “LibreWolf”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-LIBREWOLF">&#128214;</a></small>
 and <span><a href="https://mullvad.net/en/browser">Mullvad Browser</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Mullvad Browser”" title="Other site-wide references of “Mullvad Browser”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-MULLVAD-BROWSER">&#128214;</a></small>
); because I might
need <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Javascript”" title="Other site-wide references of “Javascript”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-JS">&#128214;</a></small>
 based functionality.</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “LibreOffice”" title="Other site-wide references of “LibreOffice”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-LIBREOFFICE">&#128214;</a></small>
, because sometimes I want a robust spreadsheet for advanced
nerdery.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the most part, I rarely open <span>LibreOffice</span>
, however for other folks this is
likely something necessary.</p>
<h3 id="second-order-applications">Second Order Applications</h3>
<p>Then I thought about other functionality.  I have a keyboard shortcut for
resizing and rearranging windows; this functionality is provided via
<a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/">Hammerspoon</a>.  I use <cite><a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org">Karabiner-Elements</a></cite> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Karabiner-Elements”" title="Other site-wide references of “Karabiner-Elements”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-KARABINER-ELEMENTS">&#128214;</a></small>
 to remap a few keys, namely to implement
more <span>Emacs</span>
 type navigation functions.  And I use <span><a href="https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html">Lulu</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Lulu”" title="Other site-wide references of “Lulu”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-LULU">&#128214;</a></small>
 for guarding outbound
network traffic.  For my clipboard manager, I use <span><a href="https://maccy.app/">Maccy</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Maccy”" title="Other site-wide references of “Maccy”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-MACCY">&#128214;</a></small>
.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-04-14" title="2025-04-14">Last night</time>, I spent time researching <span>Linux</span>
 packages that are analogues to the
<a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/">Hammerspoon</a>, <cite>Karabiner-Elements</cite>
, <span>Lulu</span>
, <span>Maccy</span>
:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Hammerspoon</dt>
<dd>Read <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/best-tiling-window-managers-for-linux/">alternate tile managers</a> and found the following of interest:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">Ratpoison</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Karabiner Elements</dt>
<dd><a href="https://linuxconfig.org/personalizing-keyboard-layouts-in-linux">Personalizing Keyboard Layouts in Linux</a> offers some
insight.</dd>
<dt>Maccy</dt>
<dd>Reading <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/best-clipboard-managers-for-linux/">multi-paste buffer alternatives</a> the following look promising:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/">CopyQ</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Keruspe/GPaste?via=tecmint">GPaste</a></li>
<li><a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Klipper?via=tecmint">Klipper</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/clipman/?via=tecmint">Clipman</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CristianHenzel/ClipIt?via=tecmint">Clipit</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Lulu</dt>
<dd>Reviewing <a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/little-snitch/">alternatives to Little Snitch</a>, I’ll investigate further:
<ul>
<li>Portmaster</li>
<li>OpenSnitch</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Of these, I consider <span>Lulu</span>
 and <span>Maccy</span>
 the most “urgent.”  I have an external
keyboard that stores its keyboard mappings.  I can use that to keep working.
And I don’t “need” immediate tile management; in part because I <em>can</em> use a mouse.</p>
<p>Of these second order applications, I don’t consider any of them “required” for
other folks; though firewall protection is a good idea.</p>
<h3 id="other-applications-packages-commands">Other Applications/Packages/Commands</h3>
<p>In addition, I have a <a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotzshrc/blob/main/RUNBOOK.org">MacOS Runbook document</a> that contains packages that I often
install when setting up a computer.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> The notes are Macos focused, but the packages are generally available.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
 Some of those, such as <span><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">Ripgrep</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Ripgrep”" title="Other site-wide references of “Ripgrep”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-RIPGREP">&#128214;</a></small>
, are
dependencies for my <span>Emacs</span>
 computering.  Most of those will build on <span>Linux</span>
.</p>
<p>And I consider my runbook adequate for migration purposes.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>I already have a repurposed 2012 iMac that has <span>Debian</span>
 for distribution and <span>Xfce</span>

for desktop.  I chose <span>Debian</span>
 for best general support and <span>Xfce</span>
 for its
lightweight nature.  Other considerations for desktop is <span><a href="https://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Gnome”" title="Other site-wide references of “Gnome”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GNOME">&#128214;</a></small>
.</p>
<p>My challenge is balancing the configuration time with my other obligations.  I
do, however, consider this abundance of laptops as an obligation; namely to help
make these machines generally usable.  Especially in light of the erratic trade
tariff tantrums.</p>
<p>Once configured, I rely on my daily driving to guide further tweaking and
discovery.</p>
