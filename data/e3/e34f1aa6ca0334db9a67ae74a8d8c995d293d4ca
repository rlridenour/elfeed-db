<p>Harry McCracken of Fast Company has a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91461534/apple-vision-pro-immersive-video">great, in-depth story</a> about how Apple is working with filmmakers and other creators to help them build more immersive content for the Vision Pro:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  …much of the progress the Vision Pro has made hasn’t stemmed from the routine tick-tock of software and hardware updates. Apple has also been throwing itself into the equally vital work of getting third-party developers and creators to build experiences that will help the rest of us understand what, exactly, its headset is good for. That was the goal of a Vision Pro developer event the company held at its Cupertino campus in late October.

<p>I <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/hello-robot-sandwich-launches-immersive-commercial/">wrote a little about this event</a> at the time, and met some of the creators Harry interviewed for his story, which really captures the current state of Apple’s immersive content evangelism.</p>
