In 2020, Apple introduced the ability for developers to offer customers unique, alphanumeric codes that they can redeem in the App Store <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/02/apple-developer-subscription-codes/">for free or discounted auto-renewable subscriptions</a>. Later this year, Apple will be allowing developers to offer these codes for any in-app purchases, including consumable items like in-game currency.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously said that developers can offer customers these one-time codes digitally, such as through an email, or offline at physical events. For example, the team behind Clash of Clans could promote the game at a convention by offering customers who walk by their booth a card with a redemption code for a free or discounted Sack of Gems.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/apple-offer-codes-for-all-in-app-purchases/">Apple Says iPhone Games Can Offer Redemption Codes Later This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-iphone-games-can-offer-redemption-codes-later-this-year.2458967/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
