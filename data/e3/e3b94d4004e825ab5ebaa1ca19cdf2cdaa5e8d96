<p>I was looking for something to write about, but instead spent some time reading. &ldquo;You know what,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;let me just post what I have open on my browser right now.&rdquo; Good idea, me. Let&rsquo;s call this &ldquo;In the Tabs&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>The NASA picture of the day of <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250525.html">Jupiter</a> is nice. I love the colors. Wallpaper material.</li>
<li>Manton <a href="https://timetable.manton.org/2025/05/29/episode-vladimir-prelovac.html">interviewed</a> the maker of Kagi search engine, which I use every day. Turns out he kinda has his own irregular podcast of sorts, Timetable.</li>
<li>(via irreal): <a href="https://xenodium.com/awesome-emacs-on-macos">Awesome Emacs on macOS</a> from the guy who made one of my currently favorite apps, Journelly. When he talks Emacs, I listen, or er, read.</li>
<li>The New Yorker has an appropriate <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/daily-cartoon/thursday-may-29th-gutted-by-doge">cartoon</a> about Musk leaving Doge. Good riddance.</li>
<li>Manuel is frustrated and has stuff to say on <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/on-browsers-ai-and-the-web">Browsers, AI, and the web</a>. He got a point. Several of them actually, as he usually does. Worth a read.</li>
</ul>
