<p>The 68th annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles turned into a night of both celebration and political messaging, with several artists using the global stage to address US immigration enforcement. Bad Bunny won album of the year for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos,” which multiple outlets described as a history-making win for a Spanish-language album, and he used his moment to call for the removal of ICE. Billie Eilish’s “Wildflower” won song of the year, and she was among the winners who spoke about immigration in acceptance remarks. The show also highlighted the growing reach of global pop, with “Golden” from the project “K-Pop Demon Hunters” winning best song written for visual media—reported as the first time a K-pop act has won a Grammy—and its writers delivered a bilingual (English and Korean) acceptance speech. Across the evening, visible protest symbols—such as “ICE out” pins—signaled a coordinated effort by parts of the music community to link awards-night visibility to broader public debates about migration and enforcement.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/p5muWWvNXt43bTdrOqAKb827-nzvZ1LckWDU_IvOKpuxnI5NJgaCa_ywqBO0cO0js-lWOiqOeo4NAVoR-EVuR_n2eK-ltY98qRsCeXXhBf4kbSJXzxh3pepbKc8w_it-NLlNBzA3-hcEzytXzJ5ZYMbAdDzxisKTWLXtgr8WT1Z0f7FlUWq-S1jxJuPcAsgcTVo75Rs_8H9KfOx1bJWO7GChiVCGAz7RHVR1EaaOUddS3JJ9GD7wvYsqvLBOOIMcU5yEuk3HJ7ioIO1Olw' alt='Bad Bunny accepts the album of the year Grammy for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” in Los Angeles.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Politics onstage: Several outlets described the ceremony as being dominated by politics, with immigration repeatedly raised in speeches and on attire during the broadcast.</li><li>Five-award night: Le Monde reported Kendrick Lamar as another top winner, taking five Grammys including record of the year.</li><li>British winners: BBC reported The Cure, Yungblud and FKA Twigs as the first British winners on the night in Los Angeles.</li><li>Visual media prize: SCMP reported “Golden” won best song written for visual media, with the acceptance speech delivered in both English and Korean to reflect the song’s bilingual appeal.</li><li>Film recognition: SCMP reported best music film went to the documentary “Music by John Williams”.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Bad Bunny: In acceptance remarks, he criticized ICE and called for the agency’s removal after winning album of the year.
