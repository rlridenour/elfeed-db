<p>&#8220;Many of us owe our careers to&#8230; well-timed acts of professional kindness in the face of bureaucratic mechanisms or capricious supervisors.&#8221; (Pinning this to the top for a couple of days.)<span id="more-53379"></span></p>

<p>Human history is full of turmoil and trouble; bad news isn&#8217;t new. Though we all know this, I also know that a lot of my readers are dealing with a fair amount of fresh, vivid, bad news. In the midst of challenging times, it can be consoling, inspiring, or just plain pleasant to remind ourselves of the goodness we&#8217;ve come across.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I invite you to share when you&#8217;ve been the beneficiary of a particular act of professional kindness&#8212;with as much detail as you like.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also pleased to be able to present, with his permission, John Koethe&#8217;s poem, &#8220;John Rawls et al.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>JOHN RAWLS ET AL.</strong><br />
for Julius Sensat</p>
<p>Everyone says they want to live in a decent world,<br />
But that no one can really say what it is. I don&#8217;t think<br />
It&#8217;s that hard though: John Rawls essentially described it,<br />
Though a) he was a philosopher, so no one gives a shit,<br />
And b) other philosophers keep debating it to death,<br />
Since that&#8217;s what philosophers are supposed to do. Still,<br />
It comes down to a few things that I don&#8217;t think anyone denies:<br />
First, it&#8217;s one that everyone could accept without coercion;<br />
Second, it&#8217;s one where everyone tries to have the life they want<br />
As long as others can have theirs too; and third, where what we value<br />
Is distributed in a way that makes sense to everyone. Of course<br />
The devil is always in the details, which you could spell out<br />
In various ways, and yet the overall design seems pretty clear:<br />
A vision of a realm of ends that even Plato would have been able<br />
To recognize, if not accept. So much though for philosophy.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t we simply see it and go on? Are we so oblivious<br />
To what&#8217;s there right before our eyes that we behave as though<br />
It doesn&#8217;t even exist? There must be something in the very ideas<br />
Of justice and decency that makes people laugh or scream<br />
Or pretend that they&#8217;re illusory, even though they know they&#8217;re real.</p>
<p>Maybe what seems compelling in the abstract doesn&#8217;t speak to us<br />
Unless we see each other face to face as we attempt to get along,<br />
Though empathy has its limits and proximity can drive you crazy too<br />
Like a domestic argument. Or maybe the underlying nature of the world<br />
Is so hidden from us that we hold it in awe as we go about our days,<br />
Surrounded by the starry heavens and the moral law. Either way,<br />
We seem to have an urge to make the obvious obscure and the obscure<br />
Seem obvious in the isolation of our individual lives, as in this poem,<br />
Which isn&#8217;t part of anyone&#8217;s life but mine, though I wish it were.</p>
<p>Let me lift that veil of ignorance a bit. Jack Rawls played end<br />
At Princeton and belonged to Ivy Club. He was going to be<br />
An Episcopalian minister, then became an atheist in the trenches<br />
Of WWII and wrote the book that I&#8217;ve been celebrating in this poem,<br />
A book that clarifies what everyone believes about a decent world,<br />
Whether they know it or not. My memory of him though is more down to<br />
earth:<br />
He sat in on my doctoral defense after Rogers Albritton decamped<br />
For California. Burton Dreben wanted to make me take out something<br />
I&#8217;d said about Quine, flailed about for an hour until Rawls finally<br />
Wrapped things up with &#8220;C&#8217;mon Burt&#8221;&#8221;&#8216;&#8211;it&#8217;s not for publication,&#8221; offered<br />
Me a drink at the faculty club which I declined, and then I went home.<br />
That&#8217;s my most vivid memory of the greatest moral philosopher since Kant.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure what any of this has to do with philosophy and poetry</p>
<p>Or anybody&#8217;s life, except that they&#8217;re mixed up together, as everything is.<br />
I used to talk about <em>A Theory of Justice</em> in the big introductory course<br />
I taught, though I&#8217;m no authority and no doubt got a lot of details wrong.<br />
Yet it&#8217;s remained with me and seems to me more obvious every day<br />
As I watch television and read newspapers and journals of opinion&#8212;<br />
Which you can&#8217;t say about most philosophy, or for that matter much else.<br />
And I still wish I could live in that humane and decent world, even if it<br />
only exists<br />
In my imagination and memories of Jack Rawls and of what philosophy<br />
Aspires to before it comes back down to earth and sees its vision fade.</p>
