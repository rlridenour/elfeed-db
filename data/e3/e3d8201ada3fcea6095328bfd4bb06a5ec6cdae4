  <p>The Tinted glass option generally has a relatively subdued impact
inside apps, making bars a bit frostier. But on the lock screen,
it transforms all the notifications into grey opaque blobs. I
would never choose this mode because that effect is just too ugly.</p>

<p>Now that I think about it, this is almost entirely <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/21/ios-26-1-beta-4-liquid-glass-tinted-option">why I don’t prefer the new “Tinted” option</a> for Liquid Glass in iOS 26.1 — notifications look orthopedic, like an extra-high-contrast accessibility option for the vision impaired. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1op2yhe/the_difference_between_glass_and_tinted_ios_261/">Here’s a good side-by-side comparison in a post on Reddit</a>. But as the top Reddit commenter points out, this severe over-correction from iOS 26.0 (where “Clear” was effectively the only option) is only with Light mode — in Dark mode, notifications in iOS 26.1 look good with the Tinted option.</p>
