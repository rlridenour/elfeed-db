<p>Apple Newsroom, “John Giannandrea to Retire From Apple”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced John Giannandrea, Apple’s senior vice
president for Machine Learning and AI Strategy, is stepping down
from his position and will serve as an advisor to the company
before retiring in the spring of 2026. Apple also announced that
renowned AI researcher Amar Subramanya has joined Apple as vice
president of AI, reporting to Craig Federighi. Subramanya will be
leading critical areas, including Apple Foundation Models, ML
research, and AI Safety and Evaluation. The balance of
Giannandrea’s organization will shift to Sabih Khan and Eddy Cue
to align closer with similar organizations.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">the fiasco around Apple Intelligence and the “more personalized Siri” features</a> — which were announced at WWDC in June 2024, but postponed until 2026 in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">a tail-between-their-legs announcement in March 2025</a> — and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/gurman-rockwell-siri">the executive reshuffling immediately after that delay was announced</a> that put Mike Rockwell in charge of Siri and moved all or most of Apple Intelligence and Siri under Craig Federighi, it would have been much more surprising if Giannandrea had stayed at Apple. In fact, I’m surprised he wasn’t out before WWDC this past June.</p>

<p>I don’t think we need to wait for additional details to know that he was squeezed out. If, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/apple-vision-pro-chief-mike-rockwell-named-siri-head-giannandrea-keeps-ai-role">as Mark Gurman reported back in March</a>, “Tim Cook has lost confidence in the ability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product development”, why was he still there?</p>

<p>As for Subramanya, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amar-subramanya-3642498a/">according to his LinkedIn profile</a>, he was at Google for 16 years, and left to join Microsoft <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amar-subramanya-3642498a_super-excited-to-share-that-ive-started-activity-7353453746091081729-ElkV">only five months ago</a>. Either he didn’t like working at Microsoft, or Apple made him an offer he couldn’t refuse (or, perhaps, both).</p>
