In Australia, the term ‘<a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/essence-of-entrepreneurship/">entrepreneur</a>&#39; has a very mixed heritage that may be responsible for discouraging others from embarking on a new enterprise. Bond and Skase are central to many Australians&#39; view of an entrepreneur and they, Bond, Skase and Entrepreneurs are often cited with venomous derision; so much so that it has even generated the straight-to-video release of equally dubious movies such as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264792/">Let&#39;s Get Skase</a>.</p>
<p>
Additionally, many Australians experience a sense of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">schadenfreude</a> in watching successful public figures fall from grace, even going so far, at times, to assist their fall, in a cultural phenomenon known as the Tall Poppy Syndrome. The Tall Poppy Syndrome is a social levelling phenomenon, related to envy, that is well-known in Australia and New Zealand (Feather, 1989; Mouly and Sankaran, 2002).</p>
<p>
Against the backdrop of failed entrepreneur pariahs and a social phenomenon acting to drag the successful toward mediocrity, it can be daunting for the inspired would-be Australian entrepreneur to act on their ideas; particularly because entrepreneurism, despite the bad press entrepreneurs may have received, is often a force for positive change within society.</p>

Entrepreneurs as contributors
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Understanding whether or not you would like to become an entrepreneur
greatly depends on what being an entrepreneur means to the individual.
The scholarly definition of entrepreneur and entrepreneurism has seen a
significant evolution over time. Daniel Wren, in his excellent
examination of the <em>History of Management Thought</em> (Wren, 2005: 42),
describes the use of entrepreneur, or more literally the word
&#39;undertaker&#39; by Richard Cantillon in 1755 as anyone that bought or made
a product at a certain cost to sell at an uncertain price. This
definition encompasses almost all those engaged in any commercial
enterprise.</p>
<p>
Since Cantillon&#39;s definition, the <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/management/essence-of-entrepreneurship/">distinction between the entrepreneur and the manager</a> has further evolved, possibly
as part of the academic drive to develop conceptual dichotomies. Entrepreneurs are seen as those that drive innovation whereas the
manager is primarily engaged in imitation (White, 2004).</p>
<p>
The view that the entrepreneur is a source of innovation is one
presented and supported by the often-quoted and well-regarded Austrian
economist Joseph Schumpeter, that the role of the entrepreneur is to
drive creative destruction; that is, to reform or revolutionise
(Petrakis, 2005; Turner, 2009). The necessity for entrepreneurial
activity to be creative or innovative has also led to the conclusion
that small business, previously thought to be synonymous with
entrepreneurism, need not be entrepreneurial (Carland et al., 1984).</p>
<p>
The role of the entrepreneur in creating jobs and consumer value has
also been described in great detail, particularly by Peter Drucker who
goes on to describe the activity of the entrepreneur as someone that
always searches for change, responds to it, and exploits it as an
opportunity (Drucker, 1985: 28).</p>

Entrepreneurs take on risks
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>When the activities of entrepreneurs are watched from afar though media
reports it may appear that entrepreneurs are people that take on very
large risks. This apparent propensity for taking on risk has been
extensively described in the literature (for a summary see Petrakis,
2005). However, studies have not conclusively confirmed that
entrepreneurs engage in greater levels of risk-taking behaviour than
non-entrepreneurs (Brockhaus, 1980) and for a review and summary of
other studies see Busenitz, 1999).</p>
<p>
If entrepreneurs, successful or otherwise, make the decision to act upon
their innovative ideas despite the prevailing depressed economic
conditions, what can the non-entrepreneur learn from the experiences of
entrepreneurs to gain the audacity to transition from
non-entrepreneurship to entrepreneurship?</p>
<p>
This essay seeks to examine two Australian entrepreneurs; Sidney Myer
and William McPherson to argue that the prevailing economic conditions,
boom or bust, provides an opportunity for the astute entrepreneur.</p>
<p>
Additionally, it will be argued that lessons may be learnt from the two
examples of entrepreneurs so that the non-entrepreneur may take that
walk through the ‘valley of darkness&#39; to emerge a successful
entrepreneur on the other side.</p>

<h3 id="headline-3">
Simcha Baevski (Sidney) Myer (1878–1934)
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Simcha Baevski was born in Kritchev, Belarus, in 1878, the last of 11
siblings, his mother Koona Dubrusha who ran the family&#39;s drapery
business and his Father, Israel, a scholarly Talmudist (Lifiman, 1999).
After arriving in Australia in 1899, he adopted the name Sidney Myer
and, with his brother Elcon, opened a small store in Bendigo, Victoria
and began door-to-door sales of fabric and clothes to country housewives
(Lifiman, 1999). His attitude, charm and enthusiasm, despite the initial
language barrier, led to relatively rapid success and he moved his
business to a larger store in Bendigo where he worked on building and
improving the Myer Emporium.</p>
<p>
He committed himself to world travel to make business contacts,
understand emerging fashion trends and marketing methods and eventually
took a large, but calculated risk in buying Moffat&#39;s Drapery in
Melbourne (Anonymous, 1922). Sidney, coming from a background in which
scholarly pursuits were valued, became a benefactor of educational and
health facilities during the Great Depression and, being an amateur
actor, he also became a great supporter of the arts (Lifiman, 1999). He
was equally generous to his staff, providing paid holidays, staff share
offerings and even providing an elaborate in-store hospital (Hyslop,
1986). He also established the Myer Woollen Mills in Ballarat to deal
with difficulties with imports of some of his lines of products (Neil,
1920).</p>
<p>
Following his untimely death in 1934 (Anonymous, 1934), Sidney Myer&#39;s
legacy is one of courage and philanthropy and would most suitably fit
within the Great Person school of entrepreneurism described by
Cunningham and Lischeron (1991).</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-4">
William Murray McPherson (1865–1932)
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>William McPherson was the son of an iron merchant who inherited his
business concerns after his father&#39;s death in 1888 and his brother&#39;s
death in 1896 (Patrick and Hamer, 1986). William received a six-year
apprenticeship to a metal merchant and machinery import company prior to
his inheritance, giving him a good understanding of that business. In
later years he, among others, established the Acme Bolt Company which he
owned outright by 1905 (Patrick and Hamer, 1986) which eventually became
McPherson&#39;s Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>
His educational and family background provided the basis for his
entrepreneurial activities maintaining and growing the business during
the Great Depression he did this through a shrewd business manner and an
aversion to debt. Throughout his role as a businessman, he interviewed
every job applicant and, after going on to serve as Treasurer, and
subsequently Premier of Victoria. He ensured that his staff were treated
well; providing them with lunch facilities, share offerings and bonuses
at a time when this was uncommon (Patrick and Hamer, 1986). William
McPherson&#39;s profile fits best with the Managerial School of
entrepreneurism (Cunningham and Lischeron, 1991).</p>

Defining Characteristics of Entrepreneurs
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<p>From the two case studies, and the observations of Peter Drucker
(Drucker, 1985), it appears that change is the fuel of entrepreneurs.
Though change is all surrounds us all of the time, it takes skill to
identify the opportunities offered by that change. To be able to
identify change, the above case study examples constantly searched it
out. They believed in intellectual improvement and pursuits often
travelling around the country or around the world to find new ideas and
fresh perspectives.</p>
<p>
It may be argued that being politically connected may also foster
entrepreneurial activity, as William McPherson certainly had a very
close affiliation with politics. This may provide the appearance that
it&#39;s not what you know but who you know, it could be argued that
politics is a profound source of change and being near to and in
constant communication with the agents of change means that the
entrepreneur is more likely to be able to identify a change in the
general environment.</p>
<p>
To respond to and exploit an opportunity, it is essential to have a
great deal of support. The entrepreneurs above sought out that support
from several sources to achieve their goals. They required a support
network of families and friends to help guide their values, provide them
with initial skills, give them encouragement during times of stress and
to cheer them on when they were winning. They required the support of
their customers, which they achieved by identifying their needs and
meeting them with innovative or more efficient goods and services. They
also depended on their staff to ensure that their customers are well
looked after, and both Myer and McPherson demonstrated this example in
their innovative approaches to valuing their staff. They also needed the
support of the community in which they operate, and the aforementioned
entrepreneurs are exemplars of not only corporate social responsibility
but corporate social benevolence.</p>
<p>
It is also possible that entrepreneurs identify and diagnose opportunity
differently. While the research for two of the case studies cannot
definitively provide an answer to how they identified an opportunity, in
each case the next step was to be willing and able to act upon the
findings of an opportunity diagnosis (Pech and Cameron, 2006). It is
this willingness to take that leap of faith that requires the
convergence of a number of factors based on personal attributes of the
entrepreneur such as abilities, attitudes, skills and knowledge. It also
required an understanding of the environmental obstacles and opportunity
factors affecting the new venture such as cultural and community
acceptance, social, political and environmental shifts, and resource
availability (Pech, 2009).</p>

Key differences between entrepreneurs
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The two entrepreneurs cited above came from different educational
backgrounds. One started his own enterprises while the other modified
the activity of existing enterprises that was inherited. In one case
there is a clear example of where the entrepreneur had a good
understanding of the need for someone that complemented their own
business skills; such as Lee Neil&#39;s management skills supporting Sidney
Myer. It would appear that the differences outnumber the similarities,
which may be of comfort to the non-entrepreneur looking toward embarking
on an entrepreneurial enterprise.</p>

Becoming an Entrepreneur
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The decision to take the leap and become an entrepreneur is a daunting
one, a walk through the valley of darkness as suggested in the title,
but each successful entrepreneur has made this journey by being prepared
with a map and a torch (a good understanding of their industry and
customers), taking each small step at a time, surrounded by supportive
family and friends, with enthusiasm for the journey itself.</p>
<p>
For a non-entrepreneur to make the transition to entrepreneur, based on
the case studies and literature cited in this essay, it is recommended
that you start learning to think what no-one has thought yet to identify
opportunities but then develop the decision-making skills to evaluate
and then map out a way to bring ideas to life. This may be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding an opportunity that you are passionate about or develop a passion for the opportunity you find.</li>
<li>Developing the abilities skills and knowledge necessary to run a business.</li>
<li>Maintaining a high awareness of change and remain in frequent communication with change agents.</li>
<li>Being aware of the actions of potential competitors.</li>
<li>Enlisting the support of your loved ones and friends.</li>
<li>Understanding your skills and limitations and partner with those that complement your skills.</li>
<li>Planning and mapping out how you will develop the idea and then start the business; a business plan may assist this (Stutley, 2007).</li>
<li>Starting small but plan to grow.</li>
<li>Maintaining a lookout for new opportunities while remaining wary of new threats.</li>
<li>Committing yourself to self-improvement and education and</li>
<li>Being mindful of the support, you receive from your customers, staff and the community and ensuring that you provide support in return.</li>
