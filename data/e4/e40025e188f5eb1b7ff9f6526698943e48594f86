<p>President Trump hosted Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House on Monday for closed-door talks focused on counterterrorism, reconstruction and broader security cooperation, marking a major reset in U.S.-Syria relations. Washington recently removed al-Sharaa from its terrorism list and extended a temporary suspension of Syria sanctions as the two governments discussed pausing restrictions while exploring cooperation against the Islamic State. Syria has signed a political cooperation declaration to join the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, described by Syrian officials as a political, not military, agreement.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uOqrRfTo9iKUFXwD8aTirsc_eNPmDj_BHzRgzr5awIoK41QmPkDXL2axgAa4Dl3UNb1sxJ4FXkmLbOw7T_JcRDDOBgi3-3tJPumddRAEqZh32kdDatdDDhOBAB9-wfKlt9m2W-n-nZS_D5WBBBHh_piC9Mk8a0d4B86xZwKq18nJ5FBm-0xXfg' alt='President Ahmed al-Shara of Syria outside the White House on Monday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Private arrival: Al-Sharaa arrived and met behind closed doors, entering through a side entrance instead of the usual West Wing route, and the session had limited public detail afterward</li><li>Coalition terms: Syrian officials and coalition members described the document as a political cooperation declaration that, so far, contains no military components</li><li>Security talks: U.S. and Syrian officials discussed possible security arrangements regionally, including talks on a security pact and reports — not fully confirmed — about U.S. planning at a Damascus airbase</li><li>Threats to leader: Syrian authorities reported two allegedly foiled Islamic State assassination plots against al-Sharaa in the days before his Washington visit</li></ul><blockquote>He is a very strong leader.
