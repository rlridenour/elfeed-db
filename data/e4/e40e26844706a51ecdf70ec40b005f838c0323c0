<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. faces an investigation in France over the use of voice
recordings made with its assistant Siri. The probe has been
referred to the Office for Combating Cybercrime, the Paris
prosecutor’s office said in a statement on Monday. An Apple
spokesperson referred to <a href="https://www.apple.com/jo/newsroom/2025/01/our-longstanding-privacy-commitment-with-siri/">a blog post</a> the company published in
January about its use of voice recordings, and declined to comment
further.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/le-parquet-de-paris-ouvre-une-enquete-sur-siri-lassistant-vocal-dapple/">Politico earlier reported</a> the investigation.</p>

<p>The investigation concerns Apple’s collection of user recordings
through Siri, the digital assistant available on most of its
devices. Apple can record and retain audio interactions through
Siri to help improve its services, a feature the company says is
opt-in. Some of that data can be retained for up to two years and
reviewed by “graders”, or subcontractors, <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/improve-siri-dictation/">according to Apple</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sending recorded Siri voice interactions to Apple <em>is</em> opt-in, and the opt-in screen is very clear and cogent. It’s not just something Apple claims.</p>

<p>Amazing stuff continues to happen in the EU.</p>
