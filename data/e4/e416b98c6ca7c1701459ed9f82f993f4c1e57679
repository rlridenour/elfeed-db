Apple's former design chief Jony Ive long dreamed of an iPhone with a truly all-screen design, and his wish might finally become reality in a few more years.<br/>

<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-release-schedule-shakeup-new-styles"><em>The Information</em> today</a> cited multiple sources who said that at least one new iPhone model launching in 2027 will have a truly edge-to-edge display. The device's front camera and Face ID system would both be placed under the screen.<br/>
<br/>
2027 will mark the 20th anniversary of the iPhone, so the all-screen design could arrive at a significant moment in the device's history.<br/>
<br/>
As a stepping stone towards this all-screen design, the report said that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/">iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max will be equipped with under-screen Face ID</a>, with only a small pinhole remaining for the front camera on those devices.<br/>
<br/>
The all-screen design would likely be reserved for higher-end iPhones, so it is likely coming on the iPhone 19 Pro models in September 2027.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-19/">iPhone 19</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-report/">20th-Anniversary iPhone Will Reportedly Feature an All-Screen Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/20th-anniversary-iphone-will-reportedly-feature-an-all-screen-design.2456440/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
