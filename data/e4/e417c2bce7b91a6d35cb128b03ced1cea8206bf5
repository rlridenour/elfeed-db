Mophie today announced the launch of new <a href="https://www.zagg.com/battery-cases/">Juice Pack charging cases</a> designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>

The Juice Pack for &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; was designed to be slim so it doesn't add too much bulk to Apple's thin and light <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. It includes a 2,400 mAh battery that Mophie says provides up to 60 percent more power. The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; case is 15mm thick, but it is the thinnest of the three Juice Pack cases.<br/>
<br/>
The Juice Pack for &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; has a 3,000 mAh battery, while the Juice Pack for &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max has a 3,600 mAh battery. Both cases provide 50 percent more battery for Apple's Pro iPhones and are just over 19mm thick. All three cases weigh 98 grams, according to Mophie.<br/>
<br/>
Along with additional power, the cases provide protection for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup. There are raised edges to keep the screen from getting scratched or cracked, and high-impact protection shields the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from drops and bumps. An included lanyard loop port allows for a lanyard to be attached.<br/>
<br/>
Mophie's Juice Pack cases offer passthrough charging, so plugging them into USB-C will charge the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; first and then the case. There's also support for passthrough USB-C audio for those who prefer wired headphones.<br/>
<br/>
All three Juice Pack cases are priced at &#36;99.99 and can be purchased <a href="https://www.zagg.com/battery-cases/">from the Mophie website</a> as of today.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mophie/">Mophie</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/10/mophie-juice-pack-charging-cases/">Mophie Launches Juice Pack Charging Cases for iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mophie-launches-juice-pack-charging-cases-for-iphone-air-and-iphone-17-pro.2470916/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
