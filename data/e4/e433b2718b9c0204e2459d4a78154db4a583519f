"We are incredibly excited about the strength we're seeing across our products and services," said Cook. "We expect the December quarter revenue to be the best ever for the company and the best ever for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>." Overall revenue is expected to grow 10 to 12 percent year over year, while &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue is expected to grow double digits. <br/>

Cook went on to say that Apple is heading into the holiday season with a "truly remarkable lineup that includes the biggest leap ever for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;." Apple has received a "tremendous response" to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup despite supply constraints for some &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models and also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models before the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; launched. <br/>

Apple set a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; September revenue record at &#36;49 billion, up six percent year-over-year. <br/>
