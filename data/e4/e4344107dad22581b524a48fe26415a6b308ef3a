<p>Demonstrators clashed with police in Quito on Sunday amid a nationwide strike over fuel prices, with officers firing tear gas as protesters burned tires and blocked roads [abcnews.go.com#1][pbs.org#2][apnews.com#3]. The unrest stems from the government’s removal of a fuel subsidy that raised the diesel price from $1.80 to $2.80 per gallon, according to organizers and local reports [pbs.org#2]. Ecuador’s largest Indigenous organization called the strikes 21 days ago, and the continuing protests are testing President Daniel Noboa’s administration [pbs.org#2]. Noboa has refused to negotiate with the Indigenous federation leading part of the protests, further hardening positions on both sides [apnews.com#3].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/mtRpFX0iPG0b_EKUiopLs59a2A-Wh1w7EaLZ9EpeVaQNuFhHA4eCewovUcifhGCZkGHGN7rldjyBlLF8JW20hee3RWMiwy4jlHX6zCR2MtykSBNV4AiXGQUoaAbDaIJmerulCmCjh90iRjCALwXKW5Z-WxUe0wJkTLZlWiyOSA' alt='Protesters and police confront each other amid tear gas during demonstrations over fuel prices in Quito.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Price trigger: The strike was called after the removal of a fuel subsidy increased diesel from $1.80 to $2.80 per gallon [pbs.org#2].</li><li>Street clashes: Protesters burned tires and blocked roads, while police responded with volleys of tear gas in Quito [abcnews.go.com#1].</li><li>Organizers’ timeline: Ecuador’s largest Indigenous organization says it launched the strike 21 days ago over the subsidy removal [pbs.org#2].</li><li>Government stance: President Daniel Noboa has refused to negotiate with the Indigenous federation leading part of the protests [apnews.com#3].</li><li>Political pressure: The continuing demonstrations are testing Noboa’s administration as confrontations persist in the capital [pbs.org#2][apnews.com#3].</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Indigenous organization: Called nationwide strikes in response to subsidy removal that raised diesel prices from $1.80 to $2.80 per gallon.
