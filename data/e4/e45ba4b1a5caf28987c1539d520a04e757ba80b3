While the AirPods Pro 2 included a USB-C charging cable in the box, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/apple-announces-airpods-pro-3/">AirPods Pro 3</a> unveiled on Tuesday come without one, according to Apple's website.<br/>

Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/specs/">tech specs page for the AirPods Pro 3</a> confirms the USB-C charging cable is sold separately. In the U.S., Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW493AM/A/60w-usb-c-charge-cable-1-m">cheapest USB-C cable costs &#36;19</a>, but you can of course use pretty much any USB-C charging cable from any brand.<br/>
<br/>
The case for the AirPods Pro 3 can be wirelessly charged with MagSafe, Qi, and Apple Watch chargers, so a charging cable is not strictly required.<br/>
<br/>
AirPods Pro 3 also ship without a charger, but that has been the case since the original AirPods Pro launched in 2019, so that is no surprise.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., AirPods Pro 3 are priced at &#36;249, just like the AirPods Pro 2 were. However, while there was no price increase, Apple is now poised to earn some extra revenue from additional sales of USB-C charging cables.<br/>
