<p>US lawmakers from both parties are calling for formal congressional reviews and legal analysis of President Trump&#x27;s directive authorizing military strikes on vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, including a September 2 attack near Venezuela. The push follows reporting that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth allegedly ordered a second strike against survivors from one such Venezuelan boat, an account he firmly rejects as inaccurate. Several senators and representatives say they want to understand both who authorized any follow‑up strike and the broader legal basis for treating suspected traffickers at sea as enemy forces, especially amid questions about whether Congress was adequately consulted. President Trump has said he was unaware of any instruction to target survivors, while Venezuelan officials and UN experts have criticized the maritime campaign as unlawful killings, underscoring how US anti‑drug operations have become entangled with rising tensions with Caracas.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/FMPJquwxt9b8ayvx7dOaQEWmM0CVZ47KdbZLRBLHR3fECxYRK-OSfYzIPOnd_1qqIuebiDWRkpr-UF08vG43190uxBQWaDqmHTcQehwTxqhI35Zb6_yUwYN-F6IzV5cpCJk7def3EEqmGL4eofrrgDxVWGy4i8oAomBXuf00UEoipIh5WASFl0GKVJtHaLrYERl-LCpqzeIBa2ZswqvcJzBGeRp0qn6deOZAZNnOhIHWYD_2Mig5G-pW9_4wtkI1kBdHCMTYsYkBuDpPzw' alt='US Senator Tim Kaine speaks to reporters at the Capitol about President Trump’s policy toward Venezuela.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Bipartisan concern: Democratic Senator Tim Kaine and Republican Representative Mike Turner are among those publicly backing congressional oversight, highlighting that unease over the maritime campaign cuts across party lines even as members differ on how aggressive US policy toward Venezuela should be.</li><li>Alleged second strike: According to the Washington Post account summarized in multiple outlets, a US aircraft first ignited the suspected drug boat and a subsequent order allegedly instructed forces to ensure no crew remained alive, prompting lawmakers to question compliance with US military rules of engagement and international humanitarian law.</li><li>Hegseth’s defense: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed the follow‑up strike allegation as &quot;fake news&quot; and maintains that the operations focus on disabling narco‑vessels and neutralizing what the administration describes as narco‑terrorist threats to Americans.</li><li>Questions of authority: Kaine previously tried to advance legislation that would restrict any US attack on Venezuelan territory without explicit congressional authorization, and critics now argue that the maritime strikes test the limits of existing authorizations for the use of military force and counter‑drug authorities at sea.</li><li>Venezuelan reaction: Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has rejected US accusations that his government collaborates with cartels and, along with UN experts, has described the ship attacks as extrajudicial executions that violate the rights of those on board.</li></ul><blockquote>If that reporting is true, it’s a clear violation of the DOD’s own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance. - Senator Tim Kaine</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US lawmakers supporting review: Several senators and representatives say formal inquiries are needed to clarify who approved any follow‑up strike on the Venezuelan vessel and whether such actions met US and international legal standards governing how militaries treat people in distress at sea.
