<p>Some sad news. The San Francisco Chronicle (<a href="https://apple.news/AStXd9PofQ7yTRc24ijze8A">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The eight people killed in a sudden storm while boating on Lake
Tahoe over the weekend were a close-knit group of friends and
family members who had gathered for a birthday celebration,
according to a spokesperson representing some of the victims.</p>

<p>The boating trip was a part of the 71st birthday celebration for
Paula Bozinovich, one of the people who perished in the lake, when
their 27-foot powerboat capsized during a sudden, violent storm on
Saturday. Authorities on Tuesday released the names of those
killed when the boat sank near D.L. Bliss State Park, overwhelmed
by 8-foot waves and wind gusts topping 35 mph.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bozinovich’s husband Terry and son, Josh — a DoorDash executive — were among the victims. Via email, Brian Croll, who worked in product marketing at Apple for a <em>long</em> time before retiring a few years ago, wrote the following, which I’m publishing with his permission:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paula was an employee who you are not going to see profiled in any
books on the history of Apple or Steve Jobs. She worked closely
with the ops team to ensure CDs and then DVDs shipped on time and
correctly packaged in a box. She knew all the systems and the
right people to make things happen. She was always committed to
getting things better than just right — perfect. Paula’s
extraordinary commitment, along with all the hundreds of other
unheralded employees, translated the vision of Steve, the
designers, the engineers, and the marketing people into a shipping
product.</p>

<p>One of the secrets behind Apple’s success has been its ability to
execute. Paula was an important part of that fine-tuned machine.
She was also quite a character!</p>

<p>I’m sending you this because I’ve seen front page obituaries of
executives who probably did way more harm than good to their
companies, and yet when you scratch the surface of a successful
company you find that people like Paula make all the difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing but my warmest thoughts to her friends and family.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Cdespinosa/114746774944556319">Chris Espinosa</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m shattered to hear that Apple software ops stalwart Paula
Bozinovich was killed in a boat capsize on Lake Tahoe. She truly
embodied the spirit of the company in everything she did. A joy to
work with and a tragedy to lose her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve heard from a bunch of folks today about her, and all of them emphasize two things. First, she was very, very good at her job. Second, she was very, very fun. One person said she exemplified what has always made Apple so unique: that her personality was such that she probably never would have gotten any job at all at any other big company, but she was absolutely perfectly an Apple person’s Apple person.</p>
