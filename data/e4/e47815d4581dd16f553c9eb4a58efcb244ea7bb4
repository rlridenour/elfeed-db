Gracious God,
</p>

 <p>
Thank you for the precious people <br></br>
who, quietly and humbly, have <br></br>
been the hands and feet of Jesus for us, <br></br>
who have celebrated our joys, <br></br>
wept in our sorrows, <br></br>
and sacrificed to help us <br></br>
become everything you <br></br>
have created us to be; <br></br>
each one a gift of love <br></br>
from your gracious hand. <br></br></p>

 <p>
May we also be a gift to others, <br></br>
who need to see your grace, especially <br></br>
the many women around the world <br></br>
whose voices have been silenced, <br></br>
some, sadly, by the church herself.
</p>

 <p>
Give us the grace <br></br>
to listen to those <br></br>
who are rarely heard, <br></br>
and to empower them <br></br>
to share their gifts, <br></br>
whatever they may be.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
