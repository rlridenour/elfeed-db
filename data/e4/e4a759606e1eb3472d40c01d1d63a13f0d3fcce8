<p>In the latest development, reappointed Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu named a new French government on Sunday after marathon consultations with President Emmanuel Macron, as the country races to present its 2026 draft budget on Monday [france24.com#1][abcnews.go.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][firstpost.com#1]. The line-up blends familiar ministers with newcomers; the most notable shift is Laurent Nuñez, head of the Paris police, moving to the interior ministry [france24.com#1][straitstimes.com#2]. Lecornu — France’s fourth prime minister in a year — was reappointed Friday night after his first government resigned within hours last week, underscoring months of parliamentary deadlock [euronews.com#1][scmp.com#1]. The new team faces immediate tests, with two no-confidence motions threatening the government this week, even as Macron said Monday he would continue to serve to ensure stability [straitstimes.com#3][reuters.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7Vw9qo5W34rvTw3Bk_fuzMrSHh2emJwroX4cmvyNSYlJQqBuKobu7V_fD4W470gapt0SyZIXYjszh7WXAtJq1DkD9G2s8IGjnrVXsTuefCPUmg9qyiolUzIInD57IC0To31583b2BABdgmBmpMHdF-l0llDFN8WzHOA36dArQA' alt='President Emmanuel Macron during a period of cabinet change and budget pressure.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Budget clock: The new government must present a 2026 draft budget on Monday, a key early test for Lecornu’s team [aljazeera.com#1].</li><li>Cabinet makeup: Lecornu’s line-up mixes several old faces with new ones, and its longevity remains unclear amid ongoing turmoil [france24.com#1].</li><li>Interior change: Laurent Nuñez, previously head of the Paris police, was named interior minister [straitstimes.com#2].</li><li>Political gridlock: The cabinet seeks to pass an austerity budget through a deeply divided parliament after months of deadlock [scmp.com#1].</li><li>Investor nerves: Businesses and investors are unnerved by the turmoil, adding pressure on the government to deliver a credible budget [abcnews.go.com#1][france24.com#3].</li></ul><blockquote>Never forget that the mandate given by the French people is to serve, to serve and serve, and to provide answers to the questions of everyday French people, and to do everything possible for the independence of France, - Emmanuel Macron</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Emmanuel Macron: He said he will continue to serve to ensure stability despite calls to resign.
