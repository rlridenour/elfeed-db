Since at least July 4, Apple Maps has failed to treat the privately-operated Highway 407 ETR in the Toronto, Canada area as a toll road, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/applemaps/comments/1ls22e2/avoid_tolls_setting_not_working/">complaints from affected users</a>. This issue is not limited to any particular device or software version, with users experiencing the problem across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and web.<br/>

As a result of this issue, local Apple Maps users who have turned on the "Avoid Tolls" setting may still be routed onto the Highway 407 ETR when using turn-by-turn directions. This can prove to be a very costly mistake, as the highway is notoriously expensive, with rates of up to 85 cents (CAD) per kilometer traveled for passenger vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> was able to reproduce the issue, and alerted Apple to the matter shortly before publishing, so hopefully a fix is implemented soon.<br/>
<br/>
As of June 1, the Ontario government <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1005909/ontario-permanently-cutting-the-gas-tax-and-taking-tolls-off-highway-407-east">stopped collecting tolls</a> on the provincially-owned segment of Highway 407, which runs immediately east of the privately-operated ETR segment. Apple likely updated its Maps app to reflect this change, but perhaps it mistakenly treated the entire Highway 407 as a toll-free road.<br/>
<br/>
If you scroll to the bottom of the Apple Maps menu, there is a "Report an Issue" button that allows you to alert Apple to this issue.<br/>
<br/>
With the issue now receiving media coverage, it should be in the rearview mirror soon enough.<br/>
