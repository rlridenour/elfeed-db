<p>In 2018, <a href="https://zettelkasten.de">Sascha Fast of zettelkasten.de</a> was on a minimalist task management journey and dug into Emacs org-mode, and pressured me for days (we were sharing an apartment back then) to give it a shot, because it surely would be my jam.</p>

<p>While I knew Emacs existed, I didn’t feel compelled to even try it.</p>

<p>I did use Emacs as part of a compulsory University course on UNIX and terminal program basics. We went through the Emacs tutorial on our own terms there. I picked up a couple of shortcuts that turned out to be available system-wide on Macs, too, like <kbd title="Hold Control key, press letter D">Ctrl-D</kbd> to delete forward, for example, and I used that a lot on laptop keyboards that only come with a dedicated backspace key. But using Emacs for anything outside that course didn’t feel too appealing. I did use it for assignments, because I liked it somewhat better than the other options for text editing on our computer terminals at Uni.</p>

<p>Still, I was very happy with TextMate and other “Mac-assed Mac apps”, so I didn’t bother using the software we had to use from our University terminals for more than absolutely necessary, even though it was fun to hack around in such a bare-bones environment. – Oh, if only I knew how not-bare-bones Emacs in particular was! Nobody told me about the package system at University! For example, I used Emacs to edit source files, then <kbd>Ctrl-Z</kbd> to move it to the background, compile from the shell, then move Emacs to the front again. I could’ve done all of this and more from within Emacs, and I didn’t know. So that was my first Emacs experience as a terminal-based text editor that had some weird but learn-able text editing shortcuts. (If only I knew …)</p>

<p>When I got my first Mac, I already had a laundry list of must-have apps. That was in 2008. And during that time, OmniFocus came out (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070702162237/http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">work-in-progress page from 2007</a>), and I just needed to have that app. I used it as my project and task management tool for years, with short stints into trying out <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080718110235/https://culturedcode.com/things/">actu</a>. So in 2018, I had all my stuff in OmniFocus: private tasks, programming projects everything. I didn’t want to switch. It took Sascha a lot of convincing until I caved because of that. But I gave it a try eventually the more features and tweaks and packages he brought up. A digital nerd cave was promised, and boy did it deliver.</p>

<p>I found Emacs Lisp weird, but the malleability of the system sounded just too appealing. I was amazed that plain text UI’s could be ab-used to render so many details. Eventually, I managed to make Emacs look okay (I’m a software developer, so my standards for ‘okay’ are quite low to be productive). It eventually didn’t feel like a downgrade. OmniFocus handled copy-pasting of images and other files as task attachments nicely, and org-mode …. well, I gave up on using attachments and inline images/screenshots as much early on to focus on other things, and 7 years later still haven’t bothered to look into this for most of my <code>.org</code> files.</p>

<p>What I did adopt early on was a modal key binding by Xah Lee. All web searches for Emacs Lisp tips went to <a href="http://xahlee.info/">his site</a> (or <a href="https://sachachua.com/">Sacha Chua’s</a>), and Xah clearly is into ergonomics, so I gave it a shot and loved it.</p>

<p>Especially the <kbd>B</kbd> key in command mode, bound to <a href="http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/emacs_toggle_letter_case.html"><code>xah-toggle-letter-case</code></a>. It cycles the region or the word next to the point between capitalizing the first letter, lowercase, and all caps. I used this <em>a lot</em> when proof-reading and editing book manuscripts and blog posts in our collaboration at <a href="https://zettelkasten.de">zettelkasten.de</a>. Really, it’s not funny how often I pressed this key.</p>

<p>The Xah Fly Keys command mode (aka default/non-insert mode) also comes with very nice text movement keys without having to press any modifiers. It’s easier to visualize when you check out the key binding graphic:</p>

<p>You end up with arrow keys on <kbd>I</kbd>, <kbd>J</kbd>, <kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>L</kbd>, on QWERTY. And then above the left arrow (<kbd>J</kbd>) and the right arrow (<kbd>L</kbd>), you have <kbd>U</kbd> and <kbd>O</kbd> bound to move by word boundary backward and forward, respectively. And to the outside, left and right of <kbd>J</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd>, you have <kbd>H</kbd> and <kbd>:</kbd> to move to beginning and end of line, respectively.</p>

<p>It’s like an arrow key cluster, but enlarged.</p>

<p>When proof-reading, this and the case toggle key binding did a lot of the heavy lifting. It’s much nicer to have all the movement keys next to the right-hand home row than having to hold the <kbd>Opt</kbd> key and use arrow keys to move by word boundary on Mac. Much, much nicer.</p>

<p>This sold me to the idea that if I’m spending such an ungodly amount of time in a text editor anyway, I should be able to do these kinds of customizations to make it fit my work.</p>

<p>Eventually, I uninstalled TextMate (after more than a decade of use) and OmniFocus.</p>

<p>When I did, I also went down other rabbit holes to move email, version control, shell interaction, … into Emacs. Because I could, so why wouldn’t I …?</p>
