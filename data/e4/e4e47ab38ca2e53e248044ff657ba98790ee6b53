<p>President Trump sent a message to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre saying that after not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, he no longer feels an obligation “to think purely of Peace,” while adding that peace would remain “predominant”. In the same message, he renewed his call for the United States to have “Complete and Total Control of Greenland,” an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. The reporting notes that the Nobel Peace Prize is decided by the Norway-based Nobel Committee rather than Norway’s government, a distinction Trump has previously blurred in public comments. Norway’s prime minister confirmed receiving the message, which followed outreach from Norway and Finland urging de-escalation and proposing a three-way phone call.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fibKtxGpbW0MOSOZCDEd3mu2x0kvJG7P8DPr9s0DyG13yMRElxxQOysGu-q4I5lrEZZzuIjuWos-rjw_kzLzWVCd6D8Y33TjwOBK-tVo5mou' alt='US President Donald Trump is interviewed in the Oval Office in Washington, DC, on January 14, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>How it surfaced: PBS News correspondent Nick Schifrin posted what he said was a copy of the text on X after obtaining it from multiple officials, and said it was forwarded to multiple European ambassadors in Washington.</li><li>Nato appeal: In the message, Trump pressed Nato to “do something for the United States,” arguing he has done more for the alliance than anyone since its founding.</li><li>Security rationale: Trump argued Denmark cannot protect Greenland from Russia or China and questioned Denmark’s ownership by claiming there are “no written documents” supporting it.</li><li>Tariff threat: Politico reported Trump said he would impose “punishing tariffs” from Feb. 1 on European countries that oppose his plan to annex Greenland.</li><li>Nordic outreach: Støre said Trump’s letter responded to a short note sent earlier by Støre and Finland’s President Alexander Stubb calling for de-escalation and requesting a joint phone call.</li></ul><blockquote>Considering your country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America, - Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He told Norway’s leader he feels less bound to “think purely of peace” after missing the Nobel Peace Prize and reiterated his demand for U.S. control of Greenland, while urging Nato to act more for the United States.
