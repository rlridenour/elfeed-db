<p>Former UK ambassador to the United States Peter Mandelson has resigned his membership of the governing Labour Party, saying he wants to avoid causing it “further embarrassment” after newly released US Department of Justice documents revived scrutiny of his past association with Jeffrey Epstein. Mandelson said he denies wrongdoing and disputes claims that Epstein made financial payments to him, adding that he will look into the allegations. The fresh attention follows the DOJ release of files that media reports say include banking records and other materials involving Mandelson; multiple outlets report the documents appear to show $75,000 in transfers from Epstein-linked accounts to accounts connected to Mandelson in the early 2000s. The episode adds to political pressure on Labour as it seeks to limit reputational fallout, while keeping focus on accountability and the broader public interest in transparency around Epstein’s network.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/K30U1G0JKT8YrROR_I62bfRiAWLTppohRe4SthtWuBKQS1Q0qI3qNl79GgGnSHc5lig7OW1mPbHQYsVmSLq8aQgbdVyrKKOcnXYa8hU_porZ' alt='Peter Mandelson attends a BBC interview recording in London on January 10, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>DOJ document dump: Several reports say the U.S. Justice Department released a new tranche of Epstein-related records on Friday under a disclosure requirement, prompting renewed coverage of named associates.</li><li>Payment allegation: The released files are reported to include bank statements showing three separate $25,000 payments from Epstein’s JPMorgan accounts to accounts linked to Mandelson between 2003 and 2004.</li><li>Prior dismissal: Mandelson had already been removed as the UK’s envoy in Washington last year after earlier revelations about his relationship with Epstein, including a letter in which he called Epstein “my best pal”.</li><li>Older controversies: Dawn notes Mandelson’s earlier UK political career included resignations in 1998 over a house-loan issue and in 2001 related to a passport affair, before later returning to senior roles.</li><li>Banker-tax angle: The Financial Times reports Epstein correspondence included Mandelson urging JPMorgan to ‘threaten’ the UK over a banker tax, adding a separate strand to the scrutiny around their contacts.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Peter Mandelson: He resigned Labour membership to avoid “further embarrassment,” denied wrongdoing, and said he has no record or recollection of receiving the reported payments and will investigate the claims.
