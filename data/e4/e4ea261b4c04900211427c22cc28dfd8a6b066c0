The iOS 26 public beta is also rapidly approaching, and we're continuing to hear details about Apple's plans for a foldable iPhone next year, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>

<h2>All 15 New iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Colors Revealed in Latest Leak</h2><br/>
We may finally have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/all-new-iphone-17-and-17-pro-colors-leaked/">definitive list of all color options for the iPhone 17 series</a>, ahead of the devices launching in September. An "internal document" obtained by <em>Macworld</em> allegedly reveals all of the color options for the upcoming iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max models, including a new "orange" or copper color for the Pro and Pro Max.<br/>

Relatedly, a separate rumor claims there is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/liquid-glass-iphone-17-pro-color-ios-26-design/">"special" color for the Pro models connected to the Liquid Glass theme of iOS 26</a>. It's unclear whether this is the "white" color being mentioned by other sources, but it could have a somewhat refractive finish for a glassy look to match the user interface design.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Here's When to Expect the iOS 26 Public Beta</h2><br/>
Apple has so far only said that public betas of iOS 26 and the other upcoming major operating system updates will be coming in July, but it now looks like we may have an approximate date, with <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman claiming the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/ios-26-public-beta-release-date/">iOS 26 public beta should be released on or around Wednesday, July 23</a>.<br/>

<h2>Apple Sues Jon Prosser Over iOS 26 Leaks</h2><br/>
Earlier this year, YouTuber Jon Prosser shared multiple videos showing off what he claimed to be re-created renderings of what was then presumed to be called iOS 19 and which was eventually unveiled by Apple as iOS 26 at WWDC in June.<br/>
<br/>

While not everything exactly matched what Apple unveiled for iOS 26, Prosser's renderings were undoubtedly based on genuine iOS builds from earlier in the development cycle. Apple clearly took notice, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/apple-sues-jon-prosser-ios-26-leaks/">the company filed a lawsuit this week</a> against Prosser and Michael Ramacciotti for misappropriation of trade secrets.<br/>

<h2>Foldable iPhone's Thickness and Price Range Detailed in New Reports</h2><br/>
Apple appears to be gearing up for a late 2026 debut of its long-rumored foldable iPhone, finally putting it into direct competition with Samsung and other companies that have been offering foldables for years.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Iridescent-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-995555" /><br/>
New rumors suggest the foldable iPhone could have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/foldable-iphone-thickness-and-price-rumors/">starting price in the &#36;1,800–&#36;2,000 range and have a thickness of at least 4.8 mm</a> when unfolded. That compares to earlier rumors claiming it could be as thin as 4.5 mm.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/foldable-iphone-crease-free-samsung-display/">sourcing its "crease-free" display for the device from Samsung</a>, with the cutting-edge technology also likely <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/17/foldable-iphone-galaxy-z-fold-8-crease-free/">making its way into Samsung's own Galaxy Z Fold8 next year</a>.<br/>

Topping the list are the all-new thin "iPhone 17 Air," upgraded selfie cameras across the board, and a rumored new orange-ish color for the Pro models, while other changes like the large rear camera bump and a return to aluminum instead of titanium for the Pro models may be less well received.<br/>
