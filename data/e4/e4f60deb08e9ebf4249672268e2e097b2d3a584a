<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to live games for fans in the Lakers’ regional
broadcast territory — which covers Southern California, Hawaii,
and parts of southern Nevada, including Las Vegas — full game
replays and highlights will be available to Apple Vision Pro users
in select countries and regions from both the SportsNet and NBA
apps. These live games will be captured using the new URSA Cine
Immersive Live camera from Blackmagic Design, a version of the
camera that launched earlier this year to capture Apple Immersive
for Vision Pro, and will be available for purchase next year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn’t catch <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/09/apple-immersive-video-lakers">yesterday</a> that these immersive broadcasts would only be available live within the Lakers’ local broadcast territory, which stinks, but alas, makes sense given how sports broadcasting rights work.</p>
