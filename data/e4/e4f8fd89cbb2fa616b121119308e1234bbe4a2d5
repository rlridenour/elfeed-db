 
          <p>After two years of being back in the (enterprise) software engineering industry, I&rsquo;m back out. In January 2024, I wrote a long post about <a href="/post/2024/01/why-i-am-leaving-academia-for-now/">leaving academia</a>; why I couldn&rsquo;t get a foot in the door; why I probably didn&rsquo;t try hard enough; and my fears of losing touch with practice.</p>
<p>Well guess what. I&rsquo;m back into education. I wouldn&rsquo;t dare to call it <em>academia</em> though: I&rsquo;m now a lecturer at a local university college, where I teach applied computer science. While the institution is quite active in conducting (applied) research, I&rsquo;m not a part of it. Contrary to my last job in education, where I divided my time between 50% teaching and 50% research, this time, my job is 100% teaching.</p>
<p>It feels weird to write about my professional journey the last two years. In September 2023, I received my PhD in Engineering Technology and was in constant dubio state whether to try and stick around or return to my roots&mdash;the software engineering industry. My long practical experience turned out to be a blessing for the students but a curse for any tenure track: not enough papers published, not enough cool looking venues to stick on the CV.</p>
<p>So I left. I wanted a bit more freedom and I started freelancing under my own company. At my first client, I was a tech lead and Go programmer. Go was fun until <code>if err != nil</code> got the better of me, but the problem wasn&rsquo;t Go, it was enterprise IT, mismanagement, over-ambitiousness, and of course, Kubernetes. I forgot why I turned to education in the first place. I regretted leaving academia and felt I made the wrong choice.</p>
<p>About a year later, an ex-colleague called and asked if I was in need of a new job. I wasn&rsquo;t, and yet I was. I joined their startup and the lack of meetings and ability to write code for a change felt like a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Eight months later, we had a second kid. Everything changed&mdash;again.</p>
<p>While we hoped for the best, the baby turned out to be as troublesome as the first: 24/7 crying (ourselves included), excessively puking sour milk, forgoing sleeping, &hellip; We&rsquo;re this close (<em>gestures wildly</em>) to a mental breakdown. Then the eldest got ill and had to go to the hospital. Then my wife got ill and had to go to the hospital. I&rsquo;m still waiting on my turn, I guess it&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my professional aspirations took a deep dive. I tried to do my best to keep up with everything, both at home and at work, but had the feeling that I was failing at both. Something had to give.</p>
<p>Even though my client was still satisfied with my work, I quit. The kids were the tipping point, but that wasn&rsquo;t the only reason: the startup environment didn&rsquo;t exactly provide ample opportunities to coach/teach others, which was something that I sorely missed even though I didn&rsquo;t realise this in the beginning.</p>
<p>Finding another client with more concrete coaching/teaching opportunities would have been an option but it wouldn&rsquo;t suddenly provide breathing room. I&rsquo;m currently replacing someone who went the other way and he had a 70% teaching assignment. In the coming semester, There&rsquo;s 30% more waiting for me. Meanwhile, I can assist my wife in helping with the baby. There are of course other benefits from working in education, such as having all school holidays off, which is again both a blessing (we&rsquo;re screwed otherwise) and a curse (yay more kids-time instead of me-time).</p>
<p>That also means I&rsquo;m in the process of closing down my own business. Most people will no doubt declare me crazy: from freelancing in IT to a government contract with fixed pay scales in (IT) education&mdash;that&rsquo;s quite a hefty downgrade, financially speaking. Or is it? I tried <a href="/post/2025/06/do-freelance-consultants-earn-more-than-their-employee-counterparts/">examining these differences before</a>. We of course did our calculations to see if it would be a possibility.</p>
<p>Still, it feels a bit like a failure, having to close the books on <em>Brain Baking BV<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></em>. Higher education institutions don&rsquo;t like working with freelance teachers and this time I hope I&rsquo;m in there for the long(er) run. I could of course still do something officially &ldquo;on the side&rdquo; but who am I kidding? This article should have been published days ago but didn&rsquo;t because of pees in pants, screams at night and over-tiredness of both parents.</p>
<p>The things I&rsquo;m teaching now are not very familiar to me: Laravel &amp; Filament, Vue, React Native. They&rsquo;re notably front-end oriented and much more practical than I&rsquo;m used to but meanwhile I&rsquo;m learning and I&rsquo;m helping others to learn. I&rsquo;ve already been able to enthuse a few students by showing them some debugging tools, shortcuts, and other things on the side, but I&rsquo;m not fooling myself: like in every schooling environment, there are plenty of students less than willing to swallow what you have to say.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s another major thing I have to learn: to be content. To do enough. To convince myself I don&rsquo;t need to do more. I&rsquo;ve stopped racing along with colleagues that are willing to fight to climb some kind of invisible ladder long ago. At least, I think I did: sometimes I still feel a sudden stab of jealousy when I hear they got tenured as a professor or managed to do x or y.</p>
<p>At this very moment, managing to crawl in and out of bed will do.</p>
