<p>I’m always intrigued by tools that rethink the way we work, especially when they take on an existing app category with some fresh ideas. That’s why I’m happy to see the launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bzgapps.com/quip">Quip</a>, a smart clipboard manager for Mac, iPhone, and iPad.</p>



<p>Clipboard apps usually aren’t exciting. They collect your copied text and images, and that’s about it. But Quip caught my attention by incorporating some clever new features: beautiful design, seamless iCloud syncing, robust customization with Shortcuts integration, and—most interestingly—on-device AI.</p>



<p>The addition of AI to clipboard management makes a lot of sense. Quip doesn’t just store your clips; it actively helps organize and retrieve them in context, saving you time and friction in your workflow. Plus, since the AI runs entirely on your device, your data stays private.</p>



<p>You can learn more about Quip and try it yourself&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bzgapps.com/quip">on their website</a>.</p>
