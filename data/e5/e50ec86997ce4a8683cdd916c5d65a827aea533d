<p>Some daily-note makers use paper, some use digital files, and some use both. All are valid, and I’m in the latter category. My analog daily notes are kept on scrap paper in a Paper Saver notebook and in my Wonderland222 planner while digital daily notes live in One Big Text File, known as an <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/091-obtf-obsidian-bullet-journal" title="wikilink"><span class="small-caps">OBTF</span></a>.</p>
<p>I freely admit that there’s no <em>need</em> to organise an <span class="small-caps">OBTF</span> with Markdown headings, none at all. In-file search will surface any date (assuming the entries are dated, which they should be) or topic. But I do it anyway!</p>

<p>At the beginning of this year I took the time to write out the weeks of the year. At the beginning of each new week I cut and paste the coming week’s dates to separate my notes into more easily navigable chunks. Pourquoi pas&nbsp;!</p>
<p>Here they are in case you would like to do the same:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ellanew.com/2025-01-30-week-headers-sunday" title="wikilink">Week starting Sunday</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ellanew.com/2025-01-30-week-headers-monday" title="wikilink">Week starting Monday</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Anne-Laure Le Cunff‘s <a href="https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next" target="_blank">Plus-Minus-Next</a> is a helpful way to structure regular reviews. I place it at the beginning of the week, going back to fill it in before the next week begins.</p>
<p>The<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Week <span class="small-caps">XX</span> Notes” section is there as a place marker (for want of a better word) to make it easier to view all Plus-Minus-Next reviews on one summary page. I haven’t bothered with that this year, preferring the simplicity of navigating via the Markdown outline.</p>
<p>Follow this pattern to view all Plus-Minus-Next entries on one page in Obsidian, replacing <code>OBTF</code> with the name of your file:</p>
<pre><code>![[OBTF#WEEK 01 (Dec 29 – Jan 4)]]
![[OBTF#WEEK 02 (Jan 5–11)]]
![[OBTF#WEEK 03 (Jan 12–18)]]
![[OBTF#WEEK 04 (Jan 19–25)]]
![[OBTF#WEEK 05 (Jan 26 – Feb 1)]]</code></pre>
<p>It’s not as laborious as newcomers to block quotes in Obsidian might think. Copy <code>![[../Pages/OBTF#WEEK</code> to the clipboard, paste it where you want to see the summary, then type the week number and the correct dates will appear. Press enter, then paste again to enter the next date.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this way of constructing a summary will only work in Obsidian, while reviewing Plus-Minus-Next entries via the outline works well in most Markdown apps. There’s also the option to export the summary page from Obsidian to <span class="small-caps">PDF</span> for use elsewhere.</p>
