The thin and light <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Air does not have a physical SIM slot, and is limited to eSIM-only operation. That's something of a problem, because in China, carriers have not traditionally supported eSIM for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; even though it's widely used around the world.<br/>

Until now, iPhones sold in China have always had a physical SIM slot, and that's still the case for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max. There wasn't space for a SIM tray in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air, but China won't have to go without. Apple was able to work with China Unicom to bring the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air with eSIM to the Chinese market.<br/>
<br/>
On its website in China, Apple says that customers will need an eSIM-supported carrier and mobile plan to use the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air. The company also clarifies that not all carriers support eSIM, and that customers who want to use the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air will need to sign up for a plan with China Unicom. As of right now, China Unicom is the only carrier that supports eSIM.<br/>
<br/>
China has a requirement that links a user's ID to their cellular phone, something that's harder to do with an eSIM over a physical SIM. China Unicom customers who buy an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air will be required to visit a China Unicom retail store to verify their IDs with store staff and activate their device.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/123879">support document</a> on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air in China that further says only the model A3518 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air will be able to be activated via eSIM in China. All other &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air models, including those purchased outside of China, will not be able to install an eSIM profile from a China mainland carrier.<br/>
<br/>
Chinese customers who have an eSIM-capable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air purchased in China will be able to activate an eSIM from a local carrier when traveling, but eSIMs from non-China mainland carriers cannot be installed while located in China mainland.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-air-esim-china-unicom/">eSIM-Only iPhone Air Available in China Through China Unicom</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/esim-only-iphone-air-available-in-china-through-china-unicom.2465033/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
