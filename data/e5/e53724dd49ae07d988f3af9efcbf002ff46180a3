I recently changed jobs and found myself in a position where I would need to do a lot of work on remote machines. Since I am Emacs user, the most common way to do this is using TRAMP (Transparent Remote access, Multiple Protcol). TRAMP is an Emacs package that let&rsquo;s you treat a remote host like a local system, similar to VSCode Remote Development Extension. I had used TRAMP before and it tended to be slow.
