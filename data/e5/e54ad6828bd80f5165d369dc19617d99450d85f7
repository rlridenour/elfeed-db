<li>A big honkin’ cooler that’s insulated enough to keep ice frozen inside for days</li>
<li>We’re over here slashing Amazon’s Black Friday price by 90 bucks</li>
<li>There’s a drawer (for sandwiches!)</li>
<li>Comes with a freezer pack divider and a cutting board</li>
<li>Is it available in Georgia Red: No, but imagine rolling up to a Bulldogs tailgate with this thing, packed full of beverages (and sandwiches!)</li>
</ul><h1>Portable Space</h1><p>Big holiday get-togethers. That means: lots of people. Which means: lots of food to cook. Which means: not a lot of fridge space. All of this makes sense so far, right?</p>
<p>But the problem? Lots of people also means: lots of drinks on hand. Which does not square with: not a lot of fridge space.</p>
<p>Enter the Ninja FrostVault 45-quart Cooler.</p>
<p>All you do is wheel that thing up next to the kitchen door, pack it with ice and drinks, and you’re in business.</p>
<p>Now, some of you might be saying, “But Meh, I am not one of these people who reside in the harsh climes where the very outdoors themselves function as a refrigerator from November until March. Surely, were I to fill this thing with ice and set it outside during a December day in the high 60s or low 70s, the ice would melt, right?”</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>This thing packs some serious preservation power. The ice will stay icy for days, apparently. What’s more, when camping/grilling season rolls around, you can roll this thing out into the wild, use the cutting board for prepping food, and even pack a few sandwiches in the lower drawer. (This is something Ninja REALLY wants you to do, by the way; seriously, every other product photo for this thing shows the drawer open and proudly displaying a pair of sandwiches).</p>
<p>But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Back to the whole ‘provide a little extra space to stash beverages when your fridge is full during the holidays’ pitch. The only problem with this idea? It’s the same thing that happens every time you fill a cooler. You come out at the end of the party and find, despite your guests’ best efforts, it’s still pretty full. Which means you need to unload it.</p>
<p>Annoying.</p>
<p>That’s why we recommend putting together a nice playlist of beverage-themed holiday songs to inspire more consumption.</p>
<p>You know, such great hits as:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Soylent Night”</li>
<li>“All I Want for Christmas Is Dew”</li>
<li>“Fanta Baby”</li>
<li>“Fairy-ale of New York”</li>
<li>“Rudolph the Red Nosed Rainier”</li>
<li>“Silver Bell’s”</li>
<li>“Miller Kalikimaka”</li>
<li>“Feliz Navi-dad’s Root Beer”</li>
<li>“Little Drummer Croix”</li>
<li>“Good King Wencelsius”</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, conversely, you could show a beverage-themed holiday movie. Like, maybe, <em>It’s A Wonderful High Life</em>.</p>
<p>Pretty stupid, we know. The cooler, on the other hand, is not. It’s very serious. But if you get one, please promise us you’ll abide by Ninja’s wishes and put a couple sandwiches in that drawer.</p>
