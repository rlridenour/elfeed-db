<blockquote>
  <p>GitHub notes that Claude Opus 4.1 improves across most
capabilities relative to Opus 4, with particularly notable
performance gains in multi-file code refactoring. Rakuten Group
finds that Opus 4.1 excels at pinpointing exact corrections within
large codebases without making unnecessary adjustments or
introducing bugs, with their team preferring this precision for
everyday debugging tasks. Windsurf reports Opus 4.1 delivers a one
standard deviation improvement over Opus 4 on their junior
developer benchmark, showing roughly the same performance leap as
the jump from Sonnet 3.7 to Sonnet 4.</p>

<p>Nothing spectacular here, but incremental improvements add up. Mike Krieger — best known as a co-founder of Instagram, now chief product officer at Anthropic — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-05/anthropic-unveils-more-powerful-model-ahead-of-gpt-5-release?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NDQxMTg0NCwiZXhwIjoxNzU1MDE2NjQ0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMEo0SVdHUFdDTDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJFODA3NUYyRkZGMjA0NUI2QTlEQzA5M0EyQTdEQTE4NiJ9.ZBaEbfLOztvlCdvvpJohLjqYRA-XcYxKD80FPmhsXjo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">in an interview with Bloomberg</a>:</p>

  <p>“In the past, we were too focused on only shipping the really big
upgrades,” said Anthropic Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger.
“It’s better at coding, better at reasoning, better at agentic
tasks. We’re just making it better for people.” [...]</p>

<p>“One thing I’ve learned, especially in AI as it’s moving quickly,
is that we can focus on what we have — and what other folks are
going to do is ultimately up to them,” Krieger said when asked
about OpenAI’s upcoming release. “We’ll see what ends up happening
on the OpenAI side, but for us, we really just focused on what can
we deliver for the customers we have.”</p>

<p>I’m on board with the idea that Apple <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/05/apple-q3-results">need not acquire</a> any of these AI startups, but if they do, Anthropic — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/05/regarding-those-rumors-of-apple-pursuing-an-acquisition-of-perplexity">not Perplexity</a> — seems the one most aligned with Apple’s values. And I don’t mean <em>values</em> in just an ethical sense, but their entire approach to product development in general.</p>
