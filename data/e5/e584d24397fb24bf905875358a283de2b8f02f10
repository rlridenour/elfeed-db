<p>Now <code>dired</code> is becoming more ingrained into my muscle memory, navigating efficiently through the folder structure is becoming more prominent in my mind and it still doesn&rsquo;t feel natural enough.</p>

<p>I now don&rsquo;t even think about using <code>C-x d</code> and the <em>Enter</em> key is fine for either opening a file or traversing into a directory.  But what about moving up a directory!, also a very common action.</p>
<p>The default defined key is <code>^</code> and actually isn&rsquo;t too bad and almost feels quite natural, <em>almost</em>&hellip;</p>
<p>Currently to traverse windows and buffers I am using the <code>M</code> key with comfortable key navigation hand positions as I am using these all the time.  I feel like traversing up a directory should have the same feeling, and now I think about it, getting a feel for a hand position and hence an instinctual interaction with the keyboard is almost what emacs is all about (apart from the idea of extension by macros).  Anyways, I digress&hellip;</p>
<p>What I would like to achieve is a quick command, no more than I am currently using for my window/buffer navigation, so a quick <code>M</code> and another key, one that makes sense and is sensible.  So that is why I think I will have to discount the default <code>^</code> as it involves the shift key and actually trying to reach the tilda/6 key doesn&rsquo;t feel that comfortable.</p>
<p>Hence I present the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">define-key</span> dired-mode-map (kbd <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;M-u&#34;</span>) <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;dired-up-directory</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The hand position is very comfortable, it fits in with the rest of my window navigation keys and <code>u</code> could very well mean <strong>up!</strong></p>
<p>But there is something left, something that doesn&rsquo;t feel right, or natural&hellip; and that is switching to <code>dired</code> from a file.  Now I have this new defined key to traverse up a directory I have a general feeling that I should be using the same defined key to show <code>dired</code> from when I am visiting a file in a buffer.  It is very odd&hellip; I can&rsquo;t explain it, it just feels natural.</p>
<p>If it feels right then I am just going to go ahead and do it, I think the best method is probably to define a macro as thus:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(global-set-key (kbd <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;M-u&#34;</span>) <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;file-up-dir</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">fset</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;file-up-dir</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (kmacro-lambda-form [<span style="color:#e6db74">?\C</span>-x <span style="color:#e6db74">?d</span> return ] <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;%d&#34;</span>))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The macro is just calling <code>dired</code> and then <strong>return</strong> to action the current directory.  That is all I really want to do and for some reason in my own mind I seem to have extrapolated a file to be floating above / or below a directory so it almost makes sense to &ldquo;go up&rdquo; a directory to show the directory and hence <code>dired</code></p>
