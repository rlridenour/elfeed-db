<p>If the rumors are true, 2026 is shaping up to be one of Apple&#8217;s most interesting hardware years in recent memory.</p>



<p>According to the rumor mill, Apple has five all-new products in the pipeline: a foldable iPhone, augmented reality glasses, a HomePod with a touchscreen, home security cameras and a video doorbell, and a more affordable MacBook. That&#8217;s a lot of new territory for our favorite fruit company.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m genuinely optimistic about all of it.</p>



<p><strong>The iPhone Fold</strong></p>



<p>It&#8217;s time. I have several friends who love their Android folding phones, and I&#8217;ve watched them unfold those big screens with some envy. Apple&#8217;s late to this party, but that&#8217;s never stopped them before.</p>



<p>The interesting thing is that this likely creates a new kind of trade-off at the top of the iPhone lineup. I expect the iPhone Pro will still have the better camera and longer battery life.</p>



<p>So for the first time, there won&#8217;t be a single &#8220;best&#8221; iPhone. You&#8217;ll have to choose: big folding screen or superior camera and battery. That&#8217;s a healthy problem to have. Either way, I&#8217;m curious to see Apple&#8217;s take on a folding phone.</p>



<p><strong>Augmented Reality Glasses</strong></p>



<p>I expect Apple&#8217;s first steps here will be tentative. The Meta Ray-Bans have proven there&#8217;s a market for smart glasses that don&#8217;t look ridiculous. </p>



<p>Apple has a history of entering existing product categories and making something genuinely great. The Vision Pro showed they&#8217;re serious about spatial computing.</p>



<p>Lightweight AR glasses feel like the natural next step. Let&#8217;s hope they can pull it off.</p>



<p><strong>HomePod with Touchscreen</strong></p>



<p>This one has been rumored for years, and I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m strangely invested in it. I love the idea of dedicated home control centers. If Apple takes it in that direction, a HomePod with a screen could finally make the smart home feel cohesive instead of cobbled together.</p>



<p>The current HomePod is a good speaker with Siri bolted on. A touchscreen version could be something much more useful.</p>



<p><strong>Home Security Cameras and Video Doorbell</strong></p>



<p>This one is overdue. I&#8217;d love to see Apple get serious about HomeKit hardware.</p>



<p>Right now, finding home security products you can truly trust with your data is harder than it should be. Apple&#8217;s privacy-first approach could be a real differentiator here.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not expecting them to out-feature Ring or Nest on day one, but if they nail the basics with solid Apple integration and strong privacy protections, I&#8217;m interested.</p>



<p><strong>Affordable MacBook</strong></p>



<p>Finally. Apple Silicon is so good that even a basic entry-level chip would make for a genuinely capable computer.</p>



<p>There are a lot of people who need a Mac for school, for basic work, for browsing the web. They don&#8217;t need an M4 Pro.</p>



<p>An affordable MacBook with an efficient Apple Silicon chip would serve them well and bring more people into the Mac ecosystem. I sincerely hope this one comes to life.</p>



<p><strong>Will They Actually Ship?</strong></p>



<p>Five new product categories in a single year is ambitious. Will Apple actually ship all of them in 2026? Maybe not.</p>



<p>But even if we get three or four, it&#8217;s going to be a fun year to be an Apple nerd.</p>
