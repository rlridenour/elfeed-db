<p>A large mound of garbage collapsed at a private landfill and waste-segregation facility in the Binaliw area of Cebu City in the central Philippines, killing at least one person and triggering a major search for people believed buried beneath the debris. News reports said dozens were unaccounted for after the collapse, with different counts reported as the search continued (at least 27 missing in police information cited by ABC News, and 38 missing reported by other outlets). Rescuers pulled injured workers from the site and continued search-and-rescue operations, with officials and emergency teams warning the situation remained difficult and dangerous at the dump site.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gdapAu5fQmXgzuzX7mvqjuqXJFujgMH4thlJIOz5ldRqkfx8hORq2l6pgACqmrBWQE2zJOhQn2JBaGWkLMXcXwsxNVlbbcz2g7MU_xAfCF3k1p6RygMi8PeR7p4H9ZmdZbf9fio_5cgv4Rv99brpU8-Wl-lkzleec929eX-dKA0_hTr6zqML6cvy7WEjvogoCYc0os8pzHmhF9bW0QoQ' alt='Rescuers work at the site of a landfill collapse in Cebu City, Philippines.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Workers rescued: Rescuers brought out injured sanitation workers alive—12 people were pulled from the debris in early efforts, according to BBC News and local TV5 reporting.</li><li>People found alive: Al Jazeera reported that rescuers had retrieved eight people alive as searches continued in Binaliw, Cebu City.</li><li>Offices hit: The Hindu reported the slide struck buildings used as company offices and administrative and maintenance areas for the private firm operating the site.</li><li>Police join effort: TV5 reported that the Philippine National Police joined the rescue operations at the Cebu City landfill site.</li><li>Private landfill: BBC News described the site as a private landfill, highlighting that the affected workers were part of the facility’s sanitation operations.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Police (local authorities): Police information cited by ABC News put the death toll at one and said at least 27 people were missing as rescue operations continued.
