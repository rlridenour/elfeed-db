<p>In the latest development in Switzerland’s investigation into the New Year’s blaze at a ski-resort bar in Crans-Montana, prosecutors questioned the venue’s co-owners for hours and then moved to hold one co-owner in custody, citing a risk he could flee. The fire broke out during a New Year celebration and became one of the country’s deadliest recent incidents, leaving dozens of families grieving while authorities examine possible failures in oversight and safety enforcement. Switzerland marked the moment with a national day of mourning, a show of solidarity that residents and officials say should also lead to clear accountability and safer public spaces going forward.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/EQyXPdSPdrO1clgxZO6wwtwxRJ6uOU_Q4j6JjJmgH_yilBdDxiQgz56pH0102EakkBjyjv0ySyjGsWmTy8_a7CE4egcwNA1ls2eL0nOrfHc3u8b8mmHFPhgQeoR0lKKn24cChuokEhjEReAadwFmLGZNvICyyaqSJpFgsFu_1p_xLJclQDi_RvO9PWTvvoZlY8WoYs0xc0GeQS2eu56h4ThAz88' alt='Jacques and Jessica Moretti, the owners of the Swiss bar that burned, in Sion, Switzerland.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Day of mourning: Switzerland held a national day of mourning on Friday, including a televised or livestreamed ceremony honoring those lost in the fire.</li><li>Inspection gap: The Valais canton leader voiced anger that local authorities had not inspected the bar for six years before the fire.</li><li>Judicial split: Prosecutors sought pre-trial detention for the male manager to prevent flight, while his wife and co-manager remained free under judicial supervision.</li><li>Owners summoned: Swiss prosecutors summoned the bar’s owners as public calls for justice and accountability grew after the New Year’s tragedy.</li><li>Community questions: In Crans-Montana, residents questioned how the venue operated and pressed officials to explain what safeguards failed and what reforms will follow.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Valais chief prosecutor’s office: Prosecutors said pre-trial detention for one manager was necessary to address a “risk of flight,” while the co-manager would remain under judicial supervision.
