<p>    People say you should leave Emacs's defaults unchanged.</p><p>    Emacs is unbelievably customizable. Nearly any key can be changed. But there's advice given to rely on the defaults; they have been honed over years and years to be the best for everyone. I disagree.</p><h2>    What's best for everyone might not be best for you.</h2><p>    For example, <kbd>C-z</kbd> minimizes the Emacs frame. But I've never used it on purpose. I'd hit it by accident, surprising me when Emacs disappeared.</p><p>    For nearly a decade, I hoped to get used to it. After all, haven't the default keybindings been carefully planned out? Aren't they perfect? I say no.</p><h2>    Your perfect configuration might be very different from someone else's.</h2><p>    Your needs are not the average user's needs, and your solutions should be different too. So change your Emacs to work with you.</p><p>    You can override existing keybindings with improved functions:</p><ul>    <li><kbd>M-c</kbd> on my Emacs goes to <code>#'capitalize-dwim</code>, because that's better than <code>#'capitalize-word</code>.</li>    <li>I've replaced <kbd>C-M-f</kbd>, <kbd>C-M-k</kbd>, and other s-expression navigation functions with smartparens' versions.</li></ul><p>    But we can go further than replacing functions with better-behaved versions. Here are some other ways you might want to change Emacs's default behavior:</p><ul>    <li>Disable the toolbar and menubar. Take the screen space back.</li>    <li>Hide the startup screen. Make your Emacs boot right to <code>*scratch*</code>.</li>    <li>Don't use the custom file. Configure everything with Emacs Lisp.</li></ul><h2>    If you treat Emacs as unchangeable, you're missing out on the best parts.</h2><p>    After all, Emacs was made to let you change it.</p>
