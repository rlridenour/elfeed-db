<p>Moved Journelly to sync only through Syncthing for now (using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/synctrain/id6553985316">Synctrain</a>). Only hiccup was ensuring Synctrain on the iPhone is configured to sync automatically (by default, it asks you each time if you want to sync files).</p>
<p>One thing I already appreciate: if there&rsquo;s a conflict, it tells me, and saves the conflicting changes in another file, just like in Syncthing. Meanwhile, iCloud just &ldquo;resolves&rdquo; sync conflicts for me, and I have already lost important notes because of that.</p>
