22 Shenanigans is an organization dedicated to reducing the number of suicides among veterans. Here is the benediction from the sermon I preached at an event they held on Labor Day weekend.
</p>


 <p>
Go now, follow where Christ calls you <br></br>
and proclaim the message God gives you.  <br></br>
Don’t be distracted by the concerns of the world, <br></br>
but stay focused on the hope that is within you.
</p>

 <p>
May the Father be your strength and confidence; <br></br>
May Christ Jesus give you courage for his mission; <br></br>
And may the Spirit speak when your words fail.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
