<p id="p1"><a href="https://allenpike.com/2025/why-is-chatgpt-so-good-claude" rel="noopener noreferrer">Great post by Allen Pike</a> on the importance of a <em>great</em> app experience for modern LLMs, which <a href="https://www.macstories.net/notes/the-ai-app-experience-matters-more-than-benchmarks-now/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I recently wrote about</a>. He opens with this line, which is a new axiom I&rsquo;m going to reuse extensively:</p>

  A model is only as useful as its applications.

<p id="p3">And on ChatGPT for Mac specifically:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  The app does a good job of following the platform conventions on Mac. That means buttons, text fields, and menus behave as they do in other Mac apps. While ChatGPT is imperfect on both Mac and web, both platforms have the finish you would expect from a daily-use tool.</p>
<p>  [&hellip;]</p>
<p>  It&rsquo;s easier to get a polished app with native APIs, but at a certain scale separate apps make it hard to rapidly iterate a complex enterprise product while keeping it in sync on each platform, while also meeting your service and customer obligations. So for a consumer-facing app like ChatGPT or the no-modifier Copilot, it&rsquo;s easier to go native. For companies that are, at their core, selling to enterprises, you get Electron apps.

<p id="p5"><a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/is-electron-really-that-bad/" rel="noopener noreferrer">I don&rsquo;t hate Electron</a> as much as others in our community, but I can&rsquo;t deny that ChatGPT is one of the nicest AI apps for Mac I&rsquo;ve used. The other is the recently updated <a href="https://boltai.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoltAI</a>. And they&rsquo;re both native Mac apps.</p>
