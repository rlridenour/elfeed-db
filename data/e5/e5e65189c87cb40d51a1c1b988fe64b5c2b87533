</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Hoping to fill my sleep with dreams of thankfulness, I instead awake with nothing.
</p>
        <p>I asked myself to dream of thankfulness <time datetime="2025-08-04" title="2025-08-04">last night</time>.  Laying in bed, having just
closed a book, I thought at first of happiness, but instead set about
manifesting thankfulness.  As I was rather tired, I only recalled one or two
thoughts on the matter before drifting off.</p>
<p>I don’t even recall getting up once during the night.  I awoke without
remembering any dreams.  Nothing.</p>
<p>Was it because I slept with a sleep mask?  Was my sleep deeper, beyond the
boundaries of the realm of dream?  I know that it can’t be that I have nothing
for which to be thankful.  So is it a koan on which to meditate upon?  Be
thankful for nothing(ness)?  I recall a chapter in the <cite>Tao te Ching</cite>
in which the empty space of the bowl is what we find useful.</p>
<p>Were I asked what I did yesterday, I might answer “oh nothing much.”  But that
would be a falsehood.  For I cooked dinner, made and ate cookies, read from a
few books, went swimming with our dogs, wrote three blog posts, refactored some
personal code, played a few rounds of frisbee, did some yoga stretches, cleaned
up the dishes, moved some books, found a notebook I’d used in years past, worked
my day job and likely more.  For that list of “nothing much” I am thankful.</p>
<p>I am thankful for the time and space between obligations; to have both narrow
and extended moments to be: a writer, swimmer, cook, baker, coder, and more.
But also, importantly to be a human.  And that nothingness, that space between
myself and others, that is what gives perspective on this life I live.</p>
<p>Were things crammed together, tight, how could I make sense of things.  My eyes
aren’t as young as they once were and I often need a bit of distance between me
and what I’m looking at.</p>
<p>And I consider nihilism’s “nothing matters”; something that seemed to steep my
formative years in which I lived under the backdrop of looming nuclear winters;
in the shadow of a larger generation who shaped and continue to shape the
present.  Yet nothing <em>does</em> matter.  Without it, everything would be piled
hopelessly on top of and within each other.</p>
<p>I may have dreamed of nothing, but it’s a blessing to have a bit of it.</p>
