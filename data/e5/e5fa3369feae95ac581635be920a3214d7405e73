<p>In the latest development in the Gaza conflict, Palestinian medics and civil defence officials say an Israeli drone strike hit an encampment for displaced people in the Al-Mawasi area west of Khan Younis on Wednesday evening, killing five Palestinians, including two children, and injuring dozens near the Kuwaiti Field Hospital. Israel’s military said the strike targeted what it described as a Hamas member in southern Gaza and came after clashes earlier that day near eastern Rafah in which several Palestinian fighters allegedly emerged from an underground structure and wounded five Israeli soldiers. The incident occurred despite a US-brokered ceasefire that has sharply reduced hostilities since October but has not fully stopped shelling, raids and airstrikes in parts of Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Separately, the Israeli army announced that it had identified the remains of a Thai national held in Gaza since the 7 October attacks and notified his family that his body had been returned for burial.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Iffq7qagcX65cLEU5aviOIVXwQgo9LQjLlbmNeyaaV7Dizc5ZHUEEtkIIOagbcQpAswsy35fKpYUZzeaP0eZFBmmvjxQXSfzWI-t6M5vbOQdHPzm3JaM-U45VjasaDCt0daJ7qzzLvZGRTwxaJg_17IjM1tCAFCNyKo8KWD_5zkjke-eez5uEq18hcBDyJgBRgpOZz-D7BS-czoXTuOV94aNYBnGAxOKAA7y8v0EegCvR7V3fmLQupQNNgGgqkmGL-EbM5sQozMM' alt='Smoke and damage seen in Gaza following an Israeli strike, as both sides report casualties.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Casualty details: Medical sources near the Kuwaiti Field Hospital reported that among the dead were two children aged about eight and ten, while roughly thirty or more other displaced people received treatment for shrapnel and blast wounds after the strike on the nearby tent area.</li><li>Displacement context: The strike hit tents sheltering Palestinians who had previously fled other parts of Gaza, including areas around Khan Younis and Rafah that saw heavy combat in earlier phases of the war.</li><li>West Bank raids: On the same night, Israeli forces carried out raids in the occupied West Bank, entering Qabatiya near Jenin as well as homes in Qalqilya, where Palestinian media reported arrests and people being forced from their houses.</li><li>Hostage remains: Israeli authorities said the identified Thai victim, Sudthisak Rinthalak, had been killed during the 7 October attacks before his body was taken into Gaza and held there until it was recently recovered and processed for identification.</li><li>Ceasefire strain: Local security sources described heavy artillery fire and gunship activity east of Rafah on Wednesday afternoon, suggesting that ground operations and demolitions have continued in some sectors even as the ceasefire has largely reduced large-scale fighting elsewhere in Gaza.</li></ul><blockquote>Five citizens, including two children, killed and others injured, some seriously, as a result of an Israeli missile strike - Mahmud Bassal</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Gaza civil defence: The civil defence in Gaza said the missile hit civilians in Al-Mawasi, killing children and adults and leaving others with serious injuries at a site that was being used as a shelter area for displaced families.
