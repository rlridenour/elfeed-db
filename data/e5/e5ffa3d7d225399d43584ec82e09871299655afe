Apple has partnered with multiple merchants to provide three percent Daily Cash back for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> purchases, and T-Mobile has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/19/apple-card-3-daily-cash-t-mobile/">participated in the program</a> since 2019. That's going to end in July, though, and Daily Cash back from T-Mobile will revert to the standard two percent when using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>.<br/>

In its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120400">Daily Cash support document</a>, Apple says that starting on July 1, 2025, using &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; with &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; at T-Mobile will provide only two percent cash back, instead of the bonus three percent cash back.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users get two percent cash back for all purchases made with &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, so there will no longer be any extra cash back beyond the two percent when transacting with T-Mobile, including for monthly bills.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is still offering three percent cash for &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; purchases from Ace Hardware, Booking.com, ChargePoint, Duane Read, Exxon and Mobil gas stations, Nike, Uber, and Walgreens.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/08/apple-card-daily-cash-back-t-mobile/">PSA: Apple Card Daily Cash Back From T-Mobile Dropping to 2% in July</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-apple-card-daily-cash-back-from-t-mobile-dropping-to-2-in-july.2456749/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
