</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A reflection on a new found eagerness to rise early and write.
</p>
        <p>In years past, I sustained an enamorment of early waking.  In part to make space
for myself and their thoughts; to pursue those thoughts a bit further, in the
liminality of a dawning day.  On occasion I would wake early, making space for a
time of paper and pen; in which dawn’s arrival hastened the closing of my
thoughts.  After all, it was time to get about the business of getting to work.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve made a few changes.</p>
<p>First, I no longer have a commute.  Meaning that I’ve reclaimed two hours each
day.  This began in <time datetime="2020-03" title="2020-03">March 2020</time> and I hope to continue this lack of commute to
the end of my days.</p>
<p>Second, my children have fledged, each living in cities elsewhere.  Meaning
there’s less daily back and forth to pick up, drop off, and attend school
events.  I do miss those, but that also has gifted me with perhaps an three
hours each week.</p>
<p>Third, I’ve moved to a space that has east facing windows.  Now, when I’m up
before the dawn (or in summer just with it) I can see the changing colors.  It
helps that these revelations dance with a lake that itself wakes for the day
ahead.</p>
<p>I think to friends of days past, whom would lament not having time to do the
things that we all seemed to love.  I’d mentally compare their schedule to mine,
and that I’d done the thing they lamented not doing.  I’d see that we had
similar working hours, commutes, life maintenance obligations, yet they weren’t
raising a family.  Where I’d prioritized time to engage with that shared loved,
it sounded as though they hadn’t…which is valid.  But the statement “I didn’t
have the time” sat ill with me.  I wanted to gently shake them and say, “I think
you have the time, but chose and keep choosing to prioritize other things, and
that’s okay.”</p>
<p>I wonder, what damage do we do to ourselves when we keep internalizing “I don’t
have the time?”</p>
<p>Those times were infrequent when I would rise early, shamble down to a kitchen
table and write.  I treasured and despised them, knowing that I was bartering
away a good night’s sleep for moments of near-dreamlike thinking.  And given all
other things, I couldn’t often prioritize that, because I knew that I did not
want to start incurring a sleep deficit.</p>
<p>Yet even as my children fledged and I stopped commuting, I couldn’t bring myself
to wake early.  I would instead find that thinking time in the evenings.  Time
that think it may have been in a sense of obligation.  To myself.  But also a
deep desire of “not wanting to spend each of my evenings consuming passive
visual media.”</p>
<p>Now, I almost dart out of bed in that hour of night’s fading, eager to rejoin
that intersection of thought and beauty.  I sit beside these windows and bath in
the shift from monochrome to gentle pastels.  Of a lake often glassy smooth
beginning to stir, as the coming sun brings temperature changes that set the
lake a rippling; along with the water foul waking to find a bit of breakfast.</p>
<p>I know now that those past efforts of early rising were destined to be isolated
events; nothing quite sticking.  First I was too tired.  Yet as I reclaimed more
time, I didn’t often wake early.  And this morning I believe, maybe, I know why.</p>
<p>First, there is the logistics of it all.  At our previous place of residence,
the space I attempted to ritualize writing was through a door, down some stairs,
through a hallway and to the table.  I’d guess fifty steps or so.  Now, it is
through a singular sliding door.  Five steps to get to the door and five steps
to get to a chair.  And while all of those steps are easy for me, the mental
resistance of the larger sequence creates a subtle deterrent.</p>
<p>Second, there is also now something silent and beautiful joining me each of
these days; changing from when we start to when we finish (for that day).  This
dawning event, unfolding slowly, outside of me, a companion whom I greet and
celebrate.  It demands nothing of me, yet I know it has everything to offer me.</p>
<p>And I think I needed both of these: a shift in the logistics of it as well as
adding the external (and beautiful).  Is it the beauty I needed?  Or a greater
sense of belonging?  Are those two even different?</p>
