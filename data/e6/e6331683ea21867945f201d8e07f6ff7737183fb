<p>It&#8217;s not just budget cuts that are leading some colleges and universities to get rid of their philosophy major programs. Sometimes its legislation.</p>

Reportedly, the new law has affected several philosophy departments in the state, with major programs being consolidated or cut.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that Indiana will be the only state to adopt such a measure (perhaps other states already have?).</p>
<p>Legislative, budgetary, and cultural threats have some people thinking about how philosophy can maintain a curricular presence on campus in the absence of a dedicated major program.</p>
<p>Some have suggested and implemented cross-curricular programming, such as &#8220;ethics across the curriculum&#8221; initiatives (see, for example, &#8220;<a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/08/05/philosophers-and-embedded-ethics-guest-post/">Philosophers and Embedded Ethics</a>&#8220;). At the same time, such programs have come in for some criticism (see, for example, &#8220;<a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/10/13/the-counterfeiting-of-the-humanities/">The Counterfeiting of the Humanities</a>&#8220;). Perhaps philosophers need to consider the role of <a href="https://dailynous.com/2019/10/30/philosophy-fits-schools-gen-ed-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">philosophy in their institution&#8217;s core curriculum or general education requirements</a>. Maybe there needs to be <a href="https://dailynous.com/2016/10/11/starting-maintaining-college-philosophy-club/">extracurricular philosophy</a> as well.</p>
<p>The topic will be the subject of an upcoming conference put on by the <a href="https://www.prindleinstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prindle Institute of Ethics</a> at DePauw University. &#8220;<a href="https://www.prindleinstitute.org/event/phil-conf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philosophy Beyond the Major: A Conference for Faculty and Administrators</a>&#8221; will be taking place in December and registration for it is still open. The aim of the conference is to &#8220;explore how philosophical thinking can be meaningfully integrated with other disciplines&#8212;and how we can communicate its value beyond the traditional major.&#8221; Check it out.</p>
