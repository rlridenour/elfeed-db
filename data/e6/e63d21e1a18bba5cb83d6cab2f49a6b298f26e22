<p>It appears that no new tenure-track hires will be made at public regional universities and community colleges in Oklahoma.<span id="more-56483"></span></p>
<p>J. Kevin Stitt, the governor of Oklahoma, has issued an <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/executive/2168.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive order</a> recommending  as much to the state&#8217;s Regents for Higher Education, who, it&#8217;s predicted, will comply with the recommendation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Existing tenure agreements&#8221; made prior to the executive order will remain in effect. Whether that refers only to agreements that have granted tenure, or also to agreements with existing tenure-track faculty about being eligible to be considered for tenure is unclear, though language in the order suggests it is the former.</p>
<p>Tenured and tenure-track hiring at the state&#8217;s two research universities&#8212;the University of Oklahoma at Norman and Oklahoma State University’s main campus in Stillwater&#8212;will continue, with tenured employees subject to post-tenure review at least once every five years.</p>
<p>Below are two pages of the executive order:</p>
