The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> that's coming in just under two weeks will feature the biggest design update we've seen to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X back in 2017. It's the most exciting &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; release in years, and it'll be the highlight of Apple's "Awe Dropping" event.<br/>

Here's everything we know about the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="size_and_design">Size and Design</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; is expected to be 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point, with a thicker pill-shaped horizontal bump for the camera. It will be the thinnest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date, and over 2mm thinner than the 7.80mm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Air-Colors-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010190" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will measure in at 6.6 inches, so it'll have a slightly smaller display than the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus that it is replacing. Since it's so thin, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will also be much lighter to hold than standard iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is supposedly using a hybrid titanium-aluminum frame, and the weight could come in at around 145 grams. At 145 grams, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; would be just a little heavier than the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 mini.<br/>
<br/>
Like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will supposedly have a frame that uses less glass than current models, so it could be able to better withstand damage from drops.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few design compromises that Apple made for such a thin &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The USB-C port isn't centered front to back at the bottom, and the speaker grilles have been simplified with fewer cutouts.<br/>
<br/>
As for colors, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will be available in black, white, light gold, and a light blue shade that's similar to the blue that Apple used for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="display">Display</h2><br/>
The 6.6-inch &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; display will use the same Samsung LTPO OLED panels as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models, offering 30 percent better brightness compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; display.<br/>
<br/>
The updated panel supports 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, so that could be a feature coming to the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; models. ProMotion refresh rates have always been a Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; feature in the past, but rumors suggest the entire <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup will feature the technology. LTPO also enables always-on display because it supports refresh rates as low as 1Hz in the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models, but it's not yet clear if the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will offer an always-on display.<br/>
<br/>
One rumor says that the LTPO displays for the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will support 120Hz, but not 1Hz, which would not allow for an always-on display.<br/>
<br/>
There have been some mixed rumors about a slimmer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, so it's not known if there will be changes there.<br/>
<h2 id="a-series_chip">A-Series Chip</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will feature either an A19 chip or an A19 Pro with one fewer GPU core than the A19 Pro chip used in the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;. Apple is planning to use vapor chamber heatsinks for the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup to improve thermal performance by spreading heat more evenly across a large area.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will have 12GB RAM like the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="battery">Battery</h2><br/>
Since the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; is only expected to be 5.5mm thick, it's going to have less room for a battery. Apple is optimizing battery life with the C1 modem, processor improvements, and high-density battery technology, but the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; could have notably worse battery life than the other &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest it will feature a 2,800mAh battery, which would be around the same size as the battery that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12. A leaked battery suggests that it's half as thick as the battery in the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="wireless_charging">Wireless Charging</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will support the Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard, so it will be able to charge at up to 25W with compatible Qi 2.2 chargers. 25W matches <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charging speeds.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2><br/>
There is limited internal space in the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;, so it will have a single-lens rear camera like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>. Apple plans to use the 48-megapixel Wide camera, and with just a single camera, the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; may not support spatial videos or spatial photos.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/iPhone-17-Air-Colors-Fanned-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1012942" /><br/>
All of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models will have an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera with better image quality than the 12-megapixel camera in the current &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; will use the same C1 modem chip that Apple debuted in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, which means it won't support faster mmWave 5G speeds. All &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models will use a new Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 7 support, and Apple's own hardware could bring efficiency and connectivity improvements.<br/>
<h2 id="other_iphone_17_air_features">Other iPhone 17 Air Features</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Camera Control</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charging</li><br/>
 <li>Action Button</li><br/>
 <li>No SIM tray in more countries</li><br/>
 <li>Launches with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a></li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; could be priced at &#36;899, which is the same price as the current &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus. There have been rumors of tariff-related price hikes, so it is possible that the price will be higher.<br/>
