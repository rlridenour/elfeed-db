<p>I&#8217;m pleased to welcome back&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fatcatsoftware.com/powerphotos/">PowerPhotos</a>&nbsp;as a MacSparky sponsor. If you&#8217;ve used Apple Photos for any length of time, you know the app is missing serious power-user tools. PowerPhotos fills those gaps beautifully.</p>



<p>The app has long been the go-to utility for managing Apple Photos libraries. Need to merge multiple libraries into one while keeping your albums, edits, and metadata intact? PowerPhotos does that. Want to split an oversized library into smaller, more manageable ones? Done. Looking to hunt down and eliminate duplicate photos clogging up your drive and iCloud storage? PowerPhotos has a powerful duplicate finder that handles it.</p>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s New in Version 3.0</strong></p>



<p>The newly-released PowerPhotos 3.0 is a significant update with some useful new features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Batch metadata editing</strong> — Edit photo titles, captions, and keywords directly in PowerPhotos, with keyboard-focused editing that makes tagging and organizing photos fast</li>



<li><strong>Advanced search engine</strong> — A new indexing system with nested predicates lets you search by criteria Photos doesn&#8217;t support, like file size, dimensions, and video duration. You can save your smart searches too.</li>



<li><strong>Enhanced photo browser</strong> — The browser is now faster with live updating as your library changes, plus new export options including XMP support and whole library export</li>
</ul>



<p>PowerPhotos 3.0 is a paid upgrade. If you&#8217;re an existing user of PowerPhotos 2 or earlier (or even the old iPhoto Library Manager from way back), you can enter your old license key for 50% off. Everyone can use the coupon code&nbsp;<strong>MACSPARKY26</strong>&nbsp;for 20% off both regular and upgrade orders.</p>



<p>If you want to go deeper, Brian Webster (the developer behind PowerPhotos) joined Stephen and me on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/810">Mac Power Users episode #810</a>&nbsp;to talk about the app and its features.</p>
