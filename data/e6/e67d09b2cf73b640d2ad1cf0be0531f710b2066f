<li>The Mega Mugs are 30 ounces and have a straw</li>
<li>The tumblers are 32 ounces but don’t have a straw built in</li>
<li>Fun colors</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but they sure can hold a margarita</li>
</ul><h1>Drink Up</h1><p>A 2-pack of 30oz “mega mugs” or 32oz tumblers. Sounds great, right?</p>
<p>But what will you put in them??</p>
<p>Well, that’s pretty simple. You can fill them with fresh seltzer! You know, the stuff you made using the soda-maker we sold last weekend. Just toss a few ice cubes in there to cool it down, and the Swig will do the rest. Sure, it might lose its fizz over the course of the day, but it won’t warm up; these things keep cold beverages cold for up to 24 hours!</p>
<p>Which means you might also decide to mix up a tall cocktail with the mixology set you bought from us Wednesday and load it into a mega mug or tumbler so you can sip something tasty during a backyard get-together.</p>
<p>Or, heck. Maybe you made that drink a little too strong, and you need to mainline some electrolytes. No problem! Just stir together a couple of those electrolyte powder packets we sold yesterday into 30 or 32 ounces of water in your Swig and drink it as you lounge around on the couch watching home renovation shows.</p>
<p>Or, hell, why not incorporate all three to make a fizzy, boozy, electrolyte-rich drink that’ll stay cold all day!</p>
<p>Wait, what are you talking about? You <em>didn’t</em> buy all three of those products?</p>
<p>You mean, not everyone buys every product every day?</p>
<p>Oh no! We’ve made some terrible miscalculations and overpromised some things to our investors. We better grab a flight out of the country before things really fall apart.</p>
<p>And when we do, we’ll bring a few of these Swigs with us! Because we can fill them up with cold water in the airport and be refreshed throughout the entirety of the flight that takes us to whatever far-flung corner of the world where we might best avoid the debt collectors sent by our benefactors!</p>
<p>Or, we could put coffee or tea in them, as they also keep hot drinks hot for 3 hours. (And doesn’t this feel far more reasonable than some other vessels’ claims? Like, with the cold side, we get it. Nobody wants to drink lukewarm water. But coffee that’s fresh out of the brewer? It actually <em>needs</em> to cool down a little to be fully enjoyed. So the promise of a piping hot sip 12 hours after you poured it seems a) unrealistic and b) not super appealing anyway.)</p>
<p>Our point is, these are good travel cups. So buy some if you want travel cups.</p>
