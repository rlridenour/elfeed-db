<p>If you haven't heard of <a href="https://plainorg.com">Plain Org</a>, it gives you access to <a href="https://orgmode.org">org</a> files on iOS while away from your beloved <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>.</p>
<p>Hadn't had time to post, but v1.5 has been available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002">App Store</a> for a couple of weeks now. The update is mostly a bugfix release, primarily addressing inline editing issues that appeared on iOS 16, along with a few other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Render form feeds at end of headings at all times.</li>
<li>Fixes new files not recognized by org-roam.</li>
<li>Fixes share sheet saving from cold launch.</li>
<li>Fixes inline editing on iOS 16.</li>
</ul>

<p>I love org markup, but we (iPhone + org users) are a fairly niche bunch. If you're finding Plain Org useful, <strong>please help support this effort</strong> by getting the word out. Tell your friends, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Plain%20Org%20https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid1578965002%20">tweet</a>, or blog about it. Or just support via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002">App Store</a> :)</p>
