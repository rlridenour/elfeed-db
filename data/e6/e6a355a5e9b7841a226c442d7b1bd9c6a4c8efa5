<p>&#8220;The universe is old, big, and empty. In comparison, we are new and small.&#8221;<span id="more-56091"></span></p>

<p>So begins an interesting and fun <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/738320" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> on a big question of perennial popular concern by <a href="https://www.luke-elson.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke Elson</a> (University of Reading) in the latest issue of <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/et/current" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Ethics</em></a>.</p>
<p>Observations of the vastness of the universe in comparison to tiny little us&#8212;the &#8220;cosmic disparity&#8221;&#8212;are familiar from common complaints about meaninglessness. &#8220;How could anything matter in a huge, cold, empty universe like this?&#8221; goes the cliché.</p>
<p>Philosophers have tended to reject inferences from the size of the universe to its lack of objective evaluative properties, as it&#8217;s unclear what one has to do with the other.</p>
<p>But Elson aims to defend a version of the cliché. He doesn&#8217;t argue that the size of the universe directly implies that nothing objectively matters. Rather, his position is that the universe&#8217;s immensity <em>weakens the</em> <em>evidence</em> for <em>robust realism</em>, the idea that &#8220;there are sui generis evaluative or other ethical properties.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, contrary to what many philosophers believe, size¹ matters².</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the skeleton of Elson&#8217;s argument, which he calls the &#8220;Abductive-Evidential Argument Against Robust Realism&#8221;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Robust Realism gains support from its explanation of our evaluative judgments.</li>
<li>The parsimony cost of its sui generis ontology counts against Robust Realism.</li>
<li>The cosmic disparity. Our evaluative judgments form a very small part of the total evidence base. In a smaller cosmos, our evaluative judgments would form a larger part of the total evidence base.</li>
<li>Scale matters. Insofar as a partial theory offers a good explanation or account of some part of the evidence base (or “set of facts”),this carries more theoretical weight, as that part is a larger portion of the total evidence base.</li>
<li>So, the cosmic disparity weakens the evidential support for Robust Realism provided by our evaluative judgments. That support is weaker in this cosmos than it would be in a smaller cosmos. (From 1, 3, and 4.)</li>
<li>The size of the universe doesn’t affect any of the other considerations for or against Robust Realism, such as the parsimony cost of its sui generis ontology.</li>
<li>So, all things considered, the cosmic disparity weakens the evidence for Robust Realism. (From 5 and 6.)</li>
</ol>
<p>For a further explanation of the argument and a defense of it against objections, read the whole paper, &#8220;<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/738320" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Size of the Universe Against Robust Realism</a>&#8220;, which the journal&#8217;s editor (Doug Portmore) and publisher (University of Chicago Press) have kindly agreed to make open-access for a couple of weeks.</p>
