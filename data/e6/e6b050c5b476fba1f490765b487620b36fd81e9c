<p>Alex Cheema is the founder of <a href="https://exolabs.net/">EXO Labs</a>, an AI company focused on “AI you can trust with your data” by making systems that run locally, on computers you own and control. Apple <a href="https://x.com/alexocheema/status/1899604613135028716">provided him with two M3 Ultra Mac Studios</a>, each maxed out with 512 GB of unified memory. Within a day, he had them linked together by Thunderbolt 5 and had the <em>full</em> DeepSeek R1 model running on his desk.</p>

<p>Sure, that’s over $20,000 of computing hardware. But to my knowledge there is no other way in the world to run the full DeepSeek R1 model for even <em>close</em> to $20,000, let alone doing it on your desk rather than a data center. It’s an exclusive advantage, made possible by Apple Silicon’s general performance and the breakthrough of Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686/">unified memory architecture</a>, which lets the GPU cores access the same RAM as the CPU cores.</p>

<p>Apple has tremendous technical advantages to offer in AI. But they’re marketing Genmojis of hot dogs carrying briefcases.</p>
