<p>Watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Sematary_(1989_film)">Pet Sematary 1989</a> again recently and was quite struck by the face of Judd Crandall aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Gwynne">Fred Gwynne</a> aka Herman Munster. Those Zelda scenes still creep me out. Quite often I need a bit of escapism from this crazy old techno future we find ourselves in and a slightly crappy 80&rsquo;s/90&rsquo;s movie seems to hit just the right spot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working with oils at the moment and this horrific thing keeps happening whereby I think something&rsquo;s starting to look pretty decent so I take a photo..then instantly I see it with an overly critical eye that stops me from ever sharing it. Enjoyment of the creation process comes to an end I will quite often noodle all the energy out of it. It&rsquo;s a habit I&rsquo;m trying to beat by just saying to myself I&rsquo;m going to work on something for a week then post it, wish it goodbye and move on to the next thing. I&rsquo;m not seeking perfection, I&rsquo;m after momentum. I just finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin">Rick Rubin&rsquo;s</a> book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60965426">&lsquo;The Creative Act&rsquo;</a> and this quote seemed to nail the kind of thing I&rsquo;m thinking about right now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Releasing a work into the world becomes easier when we remember that each piece can never be a total reflection of us..If we wait, it’s no longer today’s reflection..There is a timeliness to the work. Hanging on to your work is like spending years writing the same entry in a diary. Moments and opportunities are lost. The next works are robbed of being brought to life.&rdquo; ~ Rubin2023</em></p></blockquote>
