<p>I get the occasional question about my Emacs theme, font, and other eye candy. I'm always tickled and happy to share.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/Emacs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's been a while since I've made visually significant changes to my Emacs config. May as well briefly document for posterity…</p>
<h2>Nyan Mode</h2>
<p>First things first. The adorable and colorful little fella in my mode line is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyan_Cat">Nyan Cat</a> (if you dare, check the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yJgwwDcgV8">meme video</a>). Yes, I know it's sooo 2011, but it's 2023 and I still love the little guy hanging out in my Emacs mode line. I still get asked about it.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/Nyan.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This fabulous feature comes to us via the great <a href="https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode/">Nyan Mode</a> package. If looks haven't convinced you, Nyan also packs scrolling functionality. Click anywhere in it.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you can't get enough of Nyan, there's also <a href="https://depp.brause.cc/zone-nyan/">zone-nyan</a> for Emacs.</p>
<h2>Emacs Plus (macOS)</h2>
<p>I should mention I'm running Emacs 28 on macOS via the excellent <a href="https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus">Emacs Plus</a> <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> recipe. These are all the options I enable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.bash">brew install  emacs-plus@28 --with-imagemagick --with-no-frame-refocus --with-native-comp --with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-icon
</code></pre>
<h3>Icon</h3>
<p>Since we're talking eye candy, let's chat about <code>--with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-icon</code>. This Emacs Plus option enables Valeriy Savchenko's <a href="https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-icons">wonderful icon</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/swap.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Titlebar</h3>
<p>I've enabled both transparent title bar as well as dark appearance, giving a minimal window decoration.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/decoration.jpg" alt=""></p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . dark))
</code></pre>
<p>Note: both of these variables are prefixed <code>ns-</code> (macOS-only settings).</p>
<h2>Font (JetBrains Mono)</h2>
<p>I've been on <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a> font for quite some time now. In the past, I've also been a fan of <a href="https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/">Mononoki</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)">Menlo</a> (on macOS) or <a href="https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font">Meslo</a> (similar elsewhere).</p>
<h2>Theme (Materialized)</h2>
<p>I'm using <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/emacs-materialized-theme">Materialized</a> which I derived from the great <a href="https://github.com/cpaulik/emacs-material-theme">Material Theme for Emacs</a>.</p>
<h2>Modeline tabs/ribbons (Moody)</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tarsius/moody">moody</a> package adds a nice touch displaying mode line elements as tabs and ribbons.</p>
<h2>Modeline menus (Minions)</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tarsius/minions">minions</a> package removes lots of minor mode clutter from the mode line and stashes it away in menus.</p>
<h2>Hiding modeline (hide mode line mode)</h2>
<p>Hiding the mode line isn't something I use in most major modes. However, I found it complements my shell (<a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell">eshell</a>) quite well. While I was sceptical at first, once I hid the mode line in my shell I never looked back. I just didn't miss it. I also love the uncluttered clean vibe. <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-hide-mode-line">hide-mode-line-mode</a> can help with that.</p>

<h2>Welcome screen</h2>
<p>Back in October 2022, I experimented with <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-a-welcoming-experiment/">adding a minimal welcome screen</a>. I was initially hesitant, as I was already a fan of the welcome scratch buffer. In any case, I figured I'd eventually get tired of it and remove it. Well, it's enabled in my config still ;) My initial attachment to a landing scratch quickly faded. I'm only a <code>C-x b</code> binding away from invoking ivy-switch-buffer to get me anywhere.</p>

<h2>Zones</h2>
<p>I've been meaning to re-enable <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el">zones</a> in my config. They always gave me a good tickle. I've already mentioned <a href="https://depp.brause.cc/zone-nyan/">zone-nyan</a>, but if you're new to zones, they kick off after a period of inactivity (similar to a screensaver).</p>
<p>Here's <code>zone-pgm-rotate</code> in all its glory. Oh and it's built-in!</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/rotate.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Coincidentally, I had a go at writing <a href="https://xenodium.com/emacs-zones-to-lift-you-up/">a basic zone a little while ago</a>.</p>

<h2>Config</h2>
<p>Most of the items mentioned I pulled from my <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies">Emacs config</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/features/fe-ui.el">fe-ui.el</a>. There's more there if you're interested.</p>
