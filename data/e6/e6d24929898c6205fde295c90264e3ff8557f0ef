<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued Notices to Airmen advising airlines and pilots to use extra caution when flying over Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America and the eastern Pacific, citing possible military activities and risks of GPS interference. The advisories come amid heightened attention to counternarcotics operations in the region and after President Trump suggested the possibility of strikes against drug cartel targets in Mexico. Mexican authorities said the US advisory does not imply any operational change for Mexico, while Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed to “compelling results” in efforts against cartels. Overall, the move is framed as a safety step aimed at helping civilian flights plan conservatively and avoid navigational surprises in busy air corridors.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/WB7OSYBzqdQJFJv6ZCVjVFJOk2NxcJOeA03ANJtaOwZ1CD92-m3EpKLptObheoTmFS1EN8c8eyFIny6zZtAt7U5fGVbOoZKDmySWEmDgwNjqfnXq1ScdxLFkQNgQQwfrVo7BfY4_IGhT4GS6vRsQjippdkHd3Ow4GY1bWxIaaniOHhqYFBUuKAS1mUzn_E_SX5-WZHW3yysGCXOIJ4tm0sBIRxsXNGP58TYwhLLy8k5nn4US2nVgePZrD-2nYmhq5_Uf' alt='Commercial aviation image used with coverage of the FAA caution notices over parts of Latin America and the eastern Pacific.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Areas covered: The FAA notices specifically include airspace over Ecuador and Colombia and portions of airspace within the eastern Pacific Ocean, in addition to Mexico and Central America.</li><li>Navigation concern: The FAA cautioned about possible interference with the Global Navigation Satellite System, which aviation relies on for positioning and navigation.</li><li>Counternarcotics context: The notices follow nearly four months of US military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific that the US alleged were trafficking drugs.</li><li>Advisory duration: The FAA warning is set to remain in effect for 60 days, giving airlines a defined window to adjust routing and risk planning.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): The FAA says there are “potential risks” for aircraft at all altitudes in the specified regions, including potential military activities and GPS-related interference, and it advised additional caution via formal notices to pilots.
