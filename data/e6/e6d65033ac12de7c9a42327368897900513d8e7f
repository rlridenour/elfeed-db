<p>It is not uncommon for me to want to revert my current buffer.</p>

<p>For a long while I have used <code>(find-alternate-file)</code> which by default is bound to <code>C-x C-v</code></p>
<p>Recently I switched to mapping this keybinding to <code>revert-buffer</code> but now I have found out about:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">(revert-buffer-quick &amp;optional AUTO-SAVE)

Like ‘revert-buffer’, but asks for less confirmation.
If the current buffer is visiting a file, and the buffer is not
modified, no confirmation is required.
</code></pre><p>It is bound to <code>C-x x g</code> and has the added benefit of not always asking for confirmation!</p>
<p>I will try and add this new command to my muscle memory but shall I just unbind my old <code>revert-buffer</code> key-mapping or rebind <code>C-x C-v</code> to this new function also?, in other words should I fully commit?</p>
