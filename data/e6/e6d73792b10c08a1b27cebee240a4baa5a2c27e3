<p>The US Supreme Court has agreed to rule on whether President Trump’s executive order limiting birthright citizenship is constitutional, setting up a major test of how the country interprets its citizenship clause in the 14th Amendment. The order states that children born in the United States to parents who are in the country illegally or only temporarily should not automatically be recognized as US citizens, a position that lower federal courts have blocked so far. The justices accepted an appeal in a case arising from New Hampshire and are expected to hear arguments early next year, with a ruling anticipated by the end of June, a timetable that could shape the broader immigration debate in the middle of 2026. The decision will not only determine the fate of this particular order, but could also clarify how far a president can go in changing long‑standing interpretations of constitutional rights through executive action.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7V88WE9jAbr5Dtf9VnNXxZ2T6swTC7veJ8Gc52chDiiURbhOPzhdUwloGgQhaU7AbKvQnvJVpfHWKyLUQ4pSrBlpew43PPB5MkEtmoVXZOk_YaD9EEJAPzMALy5HBN5YJMinbqTJv3__gL6_uOYjfWVs1vOMVM8gh6ye_Vk7rDuL7MaKphZSV3vqU2AmOWK5jMOogCYMfK4LuiOQhDdHQKeFWq6bDNAHKyef97LgbacSzs372omRkpOO_Z6U1JgfX9iz0mkMybdJwOtnD1Y' alt='The US Supreme Court building in Washington, DC, which will hear the challenge to President Trump’s birthright citizenship order.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who is affected: The order targets children born in the US to parents who lack legal immigration status or are present on temporary visas, potentially affecting future cases involving families of tourists, students and other non‑permanent residents if it takes effect.</li><li>Lower court rulings: Several federal courts blocked implementation of the order, finding that it conflicted with long‑standing judicial interpretations that treat nearly everyone born on US soil as a citizen, which prompted the Justice Department to seek Supreme Court review.</li><li>Constitutional focus: The justices will focus on how to read the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of citizenship to persons born in the United States and &quot;subject to the jurisdiction&quot; of the country, language that has been central to debates over birthright citizenship for more than a century.</li><li>Immigration policy context: The birthright citizenship order forms part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to tighten immigration rules and reduce incentives that it argues encourage unauthorized migration to the United States.</li><li>Global interest: International media outlets from Europe and Asia highlighted that the ruling could reshape how one of the world’s most‑watched immigration systems defines membership in the national community, with potential ripple effects on global migration debates.</li></ul><blockquote>The Supreme Court has an obligation to say what the Constitution means, and that includes deciding whether the executive branch can change a century of practice on something as fundamental as who is a citizen. - Quoted legal analyst (as reported in coverage)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Trump administration: Officials argue that the Constitution does not require granting automatic citizenship to children born in the US to people who are in the country unlawfully or only on a temporary basis, and say the order restores what they view as the original understanding of the 14th Amendment.
