<p>The United States and Iran are due to open talks in Muscat, Oman, on February 6, an early test of whether diplomacy can restart around Iran’s nuclear programme—and reduce the risk of a wider conflict. Even with the meeting going ahead, the agenda is the biggest hurdle. U.S. officials say Washington wants the discussions to cover not only Iran’s nuclear work, but also ballistic missiles, support for armed groups in the region, and Iran’s treatment of its own people. Iranian officials, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, say they will discuss only the nuclear issue. They have framed the talks as requiring “mutual respect,” with Tehran emphasizing its rights and calling for commitments to be honored.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ar6gaSikW1CRXUjr_MScoLqdEvtt5NxGbvfAzcD2ie87a_i1_lendpn4eExA_uQpkwD6Kb5M3-LpMPVSrKg-ys2Cz40qSAG8l77orEBAgaZ-' alt='Chess pieces in front of displayed Iran and US flags in a Reuters illustration.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Confirmation and format: The meeting was confirmed only after days of conflicting reports on timing, location, and whether the talks would be direct; commentary has described the Muscat discussions as indirect, with Oman facilitating.</li><li>Who’s attending: Iran’s delegation is led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi. U.S. reporting says Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will serve as Washington’s counterpart.</li><li>Scope dispute (U.S. view): Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington wants talks to go beyond the nuclear file to missiles, regional armed groups, and Iran’s domestic conduct—an early sign of how far apart the sides remain on objectives.</li><li>Domestic backdrop: Multiple outlets link the timing to Iran’s nationwide protests and the government’s crackdown, arguing that internal unrest adds urgency—and complexity—to any diplomatic track.</li></ul><blockquote>Commitments need to be honored. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric – they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement. - Abbas Araghchi</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US administration: U.S. officials say President Trump prefers a diplomatic outcome with Iran but warns that military options remain if diplomacy fails.
