The company revealed the changes in a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-01-15/premium-pricing-update/">post published on its website</a> earlier today, stating that Premium subscribers in the affected markets will receive an email over the coming month explaining how the new pricing will apply to their accounts. Spotify said that the revised prices will take effect on subscribers' next billing date, while new customers will see the updated pricing immediately when signing up on spotify.com/premium.<br/>
<br/>
In the United States, Spotify is increasing the cost of every major Premium tier. The Individual Premium plan will rise from &#36;11.99 to &#36;12.99 per month. The Student plan will increase from &#36;5.99 to &#36;6.99 per month. Multi-user plans are seeing larger increases, with the Duo plan, which supports two accounts, moving from &#36;16.99 to &#36;18.99 per month, and the Family plan increasing from &#36;19.99 to &#36;21.99 per month. Spotify attributed the changes to what it described as periodic adjustments across its markets:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Occasional updates to pricing across our markets reflect the value that Spotify delivers, enabling us to continue offering the best possible experience and benefit artists.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
This latest increase is the third time Spotify has raised U.S. subscription prices since mid-2023. In July 2023, Spotify implemented its first U.S. price hike since launching in the country in 2011, increasing the Individual Premium plan from its long-standing &#36;9.99 monthly price. A second increase followed in June 2024, bringing the Individual plan to &#36;11.99 per month. The January 2026 change moves that price another dollar higher, continuing a pattern of more frequent adjustments after more than a decade of unchanged pricing.<br/>

Outside the United States, Spotify has also raised prices in recent years. The company increased subscription costs in multiple international markets in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/spotify-price-increase-2/">August 2025</a>, and previously raised prices in regions including the United Kingdom and Switzerland. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/estonia/">Estonia</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-states/">United States</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/spotify-increasing-subscription-prices/">Spotify Increasing Subscription Prices in the US Again</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-increasing-subscription-prices-in-the-us-again.2476094/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
