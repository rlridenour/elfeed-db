Starting today, the 2025 Year in Review appears prominently inside the Home tab of the Apple Books app. The feature offers a personalized breakdown of each user's reading activity throughout the year, including total books completed, top genres, most-read authors, and month-by-month engagement.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first introduced the Year in Review several years ago as a parallel to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Replay and other annual consumption summaries, and the company continues to refine the experience each year. The 2025 Year in Review displays reading trends in a visual timeline, graphs, and category-specific rankings.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the personalized recap, Apple has published its annual editorial lists highlighting the Best Books of 2025 and Best Audiobooks of 2025. These lists are curated by Apple Books' editorial team, are also featured inside the Home tab and include titles across fiction, nonfiction, memoir, thrillers, and new author debuts.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>It's been quite the year for brilliant books, so much so that it's hard to know where to start when it comes to choosing your next read. But our editors are here to help with their carefully curated top picks of 2025. There's something for every taste and mood: revealing memoirs, compelling crime and thrillers, sizzling romances, hotshot new names, trusty old favourites and so much more.
