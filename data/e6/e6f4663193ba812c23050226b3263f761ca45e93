<p>Here on Open Culture, we’ve previously featured <a href="https://dosmaps.com/">Domain of Science</a>’s elaborate infographic maps of such vast fields of intellectual endeavor as <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/02/the-map-of-mathematics.html">mathematics</a>, <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2016/12/the-map-of-physics.html">physics</a>, <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2017/09/the-map-of-computer-science.html">computer science</a>, <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2020/08/the-map-of-quantum-physics-a-colorful-animation-explains-the-often-misunderstood-branch-of-science.html">quantum physics</a>, <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2022/05/the-animated-map-of-quantum-computing-a-visual-introduction-to-the-future-of-computing.html">quantum computing</a>, <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2017/05/the-map-of-chemistry-new-animation-summarizes-the-entire-field-of-chemistry-in-12-minutes.html">chemistry</a>, <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2017/12/the-map-of-biology-animation-shows-how-all-the-different-fields-in-biology-fit-together.html">biology</a>, and <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2023/06/the-map-of-medicine.html">medicine</a>. Over time, the series’ creator Dominic Walliman has branched out, as it were, even to kingdoms of the natural world, like <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2024/01/the-surprising-map-of-plants-a-new-animation-shows-how-all-the-different-plants-relate-to-each-other.html">plants</a>. With Plantae down, which of the other five has he taken on next? That question is answered in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FqFg-rjzPo">the video above</a>, which introduces Domain of Science’s new <a href="https://dosmaps.com/the-fascinating-map-of-fungi">Fascinating Map of Fungi</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this big map depicts the realm of the humble mushroom, which “shares the forest with the plants and the animals, but it’s not a plant, and it’s not an animal.” And the mushroom itself, like we’re used to seeing sprouting beneath our feet, is only a small part of the organism: the rest “lives hidden, out of sight, below ground. Beneath every mushroom is a fungal network of hair-like strands called the mycelium,” which begins as a spore.</p>

<p>The hugely diverse “fruiting bodies” that they push out of the surface have only one job: “to disperse the spores and grow the next generation.” But only ten percent of fungi species actually do this; the rest don’t produce anything we would recognize as mushrooms at all.</p>
<p>About 150,000 species of fungi have been discovered so far. Though inanimate, they manage to do quite a lot, such as supplying nutrients to plants (or killing them), generating chemicals that have proven extremely useful (or at least <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2021/01/algerian-cave-paintings-suggest-humans-did-magic-mushrooms-9000-years-ago.html">consciousness-expanding</a>) to humans, hijacking the nervous systems of arthropods, and even surviving in outer space. And of course, “because of their ability to concentrate nutrients from within the soil, fungi are an excellent source of food for us and many other animals.” Mycologists estimate that there remain at least two or three million more species “out there in nature waiting to be discovered.” At least a few of them, one hopes, will turn out to be tasty.</p>
