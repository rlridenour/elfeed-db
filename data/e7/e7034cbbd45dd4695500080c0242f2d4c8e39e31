REPLACED [2022-11-11 Fri] The below is hopefully informative, but it actually only causes a thing to deploy once and then to re-deploy on system restart. For instructions that ACTUALLY auto-deploy, see https://tech.toryanderson.com/2022/11/11/systemd-devops-run-and-restart-services/
  Updated [2022-09-19 Mon] Fixed error in deploy script that occurred if trying to restart but nothing was in the docket
  Updated [2022-07-13 Wed] Enhanced the server-side deploy script to operate more transparently if files are missing.
