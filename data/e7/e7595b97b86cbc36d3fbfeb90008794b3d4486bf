<p>Last year on this day, I went out on a snow walk. I&rsquo;m considering doing this later today&hellip; only difference is it&rsquo;s 30 degrees colder than it was exactly a year ago. A year before that, my partner came up with what I call &ldquo;zombie margaritas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I really like the &ldquo;<a href="https://taonaw.com/on-this-day/">On this day</a>&rdquo; on my blog 😃</p>
