<li>5 bucks per switch for the non-dimmable</li>
<li>$7.50 per switch for the dimmable</li>
<li>Set them up with a well-reviewed app: here’s for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vesync/id1289575311">Apple</a>, here’s for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.etekcity.vesyncplatform&hl=en_US">Android</a></li>
<li>Set a schedule, make timers, or set them up to change with your local sunrise and sunset</li>
<li>Also works with Google Assistant and Alexa (but not IFTTT)</li>
<li>Dimmable ones can glow cool colors (like around the switch) but you don’t have to</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but they can glow a green margarita-y color</li>
</ul><h1>Intelligent Turners-On</h1><p>Like many people, before I took the dive into home ownership, I spent years and years renting. In fact, between college and the purchase of my first home, I lived in 9 rental properties in 8 different cities.</p>
<p>Which, thinking about that, yikes.</p>
<p>But anyway, my point here is, I went through a period of renting, which meant I dealt with home quirks galore.</p>
<p>Weird layouts. Awful color choices. A lot of janky bullshit. You name it.</p>
<p>And this conditioned me, in a way. It wired my brain to think: <em>hey, some stuff in a home is just weird and/or annoying</em>.</p>
<p>Bathroom door through the closet? Lol, sure. A pink sparkly wall? Interesting. Two-prong outlets only? Aww, shucks. Outlets that plugs keep falling out of? Yuk, yuk, too bad. Some totally busted old light switches? Oof, but oh well.</p>
<p>Except, here’s the thing: it doesn’t have to be this way. I’m in charge now. I can change whatever I want.</p>
<p>(Or, whatever I want within a reasonable budget. So maybe not big things that require renovation. The hot tub built into the kitchen floor will have to wait a little longer. <em>Sigh!</em>)</p>
<p>This seems so obvious for stuff like paint color or arranging furniture or whatnot, mostly due to the fact that this stuff provides immediate satisfaction. Meanwhile, it’s easy to overlook those last things on the list–the outlets and the light switches–because they’re not “fun.”</p>
<p>But, they will make a difference. And also, they’re pretty cheap.</p>
<p>At least these smart switches are.</p>
<p>You can choose between dimmable and non-dimmable. They can be controlled via an app. Or, you know, you can touch the buttons with your fingers. They can glow cool colors so you can see them at night. But they don’t have to. Basically, what we’re saying is that they’re smart switches, but we’re selling them cheap enough that you don’t need to feel bad if you rarely (or never) use the smart features.</p>
<p>Or, to put it differently: maybe it’s time to make the switch… to better switches!</p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p>Look, just buy some, okay.</p>
