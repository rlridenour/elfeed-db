<p>A posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre went on sale in London on Tuesday, reviving scrutiny of Britain&#x27;s Prince Andrew over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein; Andrew continues to deny wrongdoing [straitstimes.com#2][theglobeandmail.com#1][dw.com#1][straitstimes.com#1]. The release follows Andrew&#x27;s announcement on Friday that he would stop using his Duke of York title, a step taken after pressure from King Charles; Prince William was consulted on the move [newarab.com#1]. Andrew previously settled Giuffre&#x27;s U.S. civil case in 2022 without admitting liability [newarab.com#1][dw.com#1].
