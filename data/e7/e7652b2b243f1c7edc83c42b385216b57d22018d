<p>Heavy winter rains swept through Gaza&#x27;s tent camps on and around 15 November 2025, flooding makeshift shelters in sites such as the sprawling Muwasi camp and exposing displaced families to cold, wind and water damage. Aid groups and residents say the damage comes at a moment when shelter stocks are already low because deliveries of replacement tents and materials have been restricted, a dynamic humanitarians warn is worsening an already dire situation after more than two years of fighting. Agencies and local residents are calling for rapid access to winterized shelter, blankets, heating, clean water and sanitation to reduce immediate health risks from exposure and contamination.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/t1FalVn2tnZuAIgdZlXet9CD31ek-9QkOMJXCqPHEzFXdkK-GRyZGBr_8Awp0LSZY5Dmskoq4F5OMlqdGowtXEhLtM6m3bRaOk2Ldx6xrAwROaSL55RgMs8FJd25bl_SUDDNcmGUuQAbtH01lSOIllZyDz8JOFQbk6iq7oujg9RYyF11-__Cng' alt='A flooded tent in Gaza City on Friday; many Palestinians remain in camps without running water or electricity after prolonged fighting.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Supply restrictions: Reports say Israeli restrictions on some shelter shipments have limited agencies&#x27; ability to replace ruined tents, hampering winter relief operations.</li><li>Camp damage: In Muwasi camp, floodwater cascaded through rows of improvised shelters, leaving many tents soaked and structurally compromised.</li><li>Utilities lost: Large numbers of displaced people remain without running water or electricity after prolonged fighting, complicating sanitation and heating efforts during the rains.</li><li>Seasonal timing: Journalists described these events as Gaza’s first major winter rains of the season, sharply increasing demand for winterized shelter and warm supplies.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Palestinian families: Families in displaced camps called for help as tents flooded and shelter was destroyed, leaving many exposed to cold and rain.
