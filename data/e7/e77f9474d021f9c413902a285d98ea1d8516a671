In iOS 26, Apple Intelligence makes the Wallet app's order tracking feature genuinely useful by scanning your email for shipping details. <br/>

The ability to track orders in Apple Wallet isn't new – it's actually been around since iOS 16. But if you've never noticed it before, don't worry. Most people haven't used it either.<br/>
<br/>
The feature initially struggled because it relied on merchants to actively support it, but not many bothered. In fact, despite being available for years, order tracking in Apple's Wallet app remained largely unused. But there's a decent chance iOS 26 will change all that.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Order Tracking Meets Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
In iOS 26, Apple Intelligence now scans your emails to automatically extract order tracking information. This means virtually any online purchase that generates a confirmation email can now appear in the Wallet app.<br/>
<br/>
The on-device AI identifies shipping details from emails sent by merchants or delivery carriers, then consolidates everything in the Wallet app's Order Tracking page.<br/>
<br/>
Just note that you'll need an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone 17, or iPhone Air to access the improved order tracking, since Apple Intelligence isn't available on older devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Enabling Order Tracking in Settings</h2><br/>
You can enable the AI-enhanced order tracking feature in the following way:<br/>
<ol><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your iPhone.</li>  <br/>
<li>Go to <strong>Apps ➝ Wallet</strong>.</li>  <br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Order Tracking</strong> at the bottom of the menu.</li>  <br/>
<li>Toggle on <strong>Apple Pay</strong> (this enables automatic order addition).</li>  <br/>
<li>Toggle on <strong>Mail (Beta)</strong> to allow Apple Intelligence to scan your emails.</li>  </ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/09/wallet-order-tracking-ios-261.jpg" alt="" width="2760" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021193" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Finding Your Orders in Wallet</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Wallet</strong> app on your iPhone.</li>  <br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>More</strong> icon (three dots) in the top-right corner.</li>  <br/>
<li>Select <strong>Orders</strong> from the dropdown menu.</li>  <br/>
<li>Browse your orders, organized by month and year.</li>  <br/>

<br/>
Your orders appear with merchant details, order status, and tracking information when available. You can tap individual orders to see more detailed tracking information and shipping updates, as well as mark the order as complete, mute notifications, or delete the order.<br/>

The revamped order tracking finally delivers on Wallet's promise as a centralized hub for purchase information.
