<p>Iraq’s defence ministry says the Iraqi army has assumed full operational control of the Ain al-Asad Airbase in western Iraq after U.S. forces withdrew from the facility. Officials said U.S. troops left the base and removed American equipment as the handover took effect. The shift follows a 2024 U.S.-Iraq understanding to wind down the U.S.-led coalition mission and move toward a bilateral security relationship—an orderly transition that Iraqi officials frame as a step toward greater national responsibility for security.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/E7HkzfigmeA4_HIAc_MLwiaXRE-pTIkGp91PKhcxGWTGXQk4OVrxH3KQv1QsYxMxyuCrCpMYA-RJJI1zjpprGlT3d0bmnxa2WPBd7PW4NXCkdXas4q-EGOYrnao--S1rb78HKZQjLyIfuOYwgpq03K-8zNE' alt='An exterior view associated with coverage of the Ain al-Asad handover in western Iraq.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>First since 2014: Reuters described the handover as the first time Iraq has held full operational control of Al-Asad since 2014, marking a symbolic milestone in the post-ISIS era.</li><li>Coalition drawdown: The withdrawal is presented as part of implementing the 2024 U.S.-Iraq plan to end U.S.-led coalition operations and reconfigure cooperation into a bilateral security arrangement.</li><li>Equipment removed: Reporting emphasized that U.S. forces did not just redeploy personnel; they also took U.S. equipment out of the base during the withdrawal process.</li><li>Western Iraq role: The base previously housed U.S.-led forces in western Iraq, underlining why both sides treated the transition as a consequential operational change rather than a routine facility handover.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Iraqi defence ministry: Iraq’s military has now taken full control of Ain al-Asad following the U.S. withdrawal, according to the ministry’s statement.
