The cash-back offer is also available at qualifying ChargePoint stations for electric vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
5% Daily Cash is limited to &#36;500 in combined Exxon, Mobil, and ChargePoint purchases, meaning that the maximum cash back you can receive from this offer is &#36;25.<br/>
<br/>
Ordinarily, the Apple Card offers 3% Daily Cash for Exxon, Mobil, and ChargePoint purchases, which is already above the standard 2% Daily Cash that is offered for most purchases made with the Apple Card via Apple Pay.<br/>
<br/>
When using the physical Apple Card, Daily Cash is limited to 1%, so make sure to use the digital version in your iPhone's Wallet app.<br/>
