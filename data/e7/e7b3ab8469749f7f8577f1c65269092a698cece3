Software is generally terrible. It's buggy and slow, despite computers
being ridiculously fast. And even when it's not buggy it often does
something weird or that isn't quite what you want. When I saw the call
for <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/08/01/emacs-carnival-2025-08-your-elevator-pitch-for-emacs/">this month's Emacs Carnival</a> asking for elevator pitches for Emacs,
I started collecting bugs and oddities in the software I use. I don't
want to pick on some poor indie programmer, so here's a list of bugs
or odd behaviors I've observed during just this month in software from
Google and Facebook:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A boat load of YouTube bugs or quirks:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Play/pause button doesn't always show the right state.</li>
<li>The speed control UI is randomly selected among about 3 different ones.</li>
<li>Sometimes when double tapping to rewind 10 seconds, the playback
speed is reset to 1x.</li>
<li>Changing the playback speed sometimes does nothing.</li>
<li>Sometimes when you open the Android app, you get a tiny black rectangle
in the corner that I can't figure out how to interact with. I wind
up just restarting the application.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>In the YouTube Music app, finished podcast episodes sometimes don't
show up as "played". Leaving the list of downloaded episodes and
returning to it fixes this.</li>

<li>On the Facebook webpage the animations for reactions don't load for
me anymore. (Luckily hovering on the blank space shows a tool-tip
stating which reaction it is.) I'd be perfectly happy with static
images or even text...</li>

<li>The Google search page can be configured to match your system dark
mode preference. But it isn't fully automatic, for a change to
register, even in brand new browser tabs, you have to reload (or go
into settings, not to change anything, just going into settings is
enough!).</li>

<li>The battery indicator on my Android phone occasionally doesn't show
that the phone is plugged in until I reboot it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And there's nothing I can do about any of this! I guess I could try to
report the bugs and hope someone fixes them, but the play/pause
problem seems to be about a decade old from what I've read online so
I'm not holding my breath.
</p>

<p>
My elevator pitch for Emacs is simply: <i>you don't have to put up with
any of this crap in Emacs!</i> You can just fix any bug or behavior you
dislike without waiting for anyone! I often notice something I don't
like, fix it in my personal configuration, and only afterwards report
the bug (and usually I then monitor updates to that piece of software
to see when I can remove my personal workaround).
</p>

<p>
Now, you might think the problem is that I use proprietary software,
and that if I only used open source software all my computing
experience would be Emacsian, that I'd be fixing bugs left and right.
No, I wouldn't! Emacs makes this as frictionless as possible. For most
open source software I use, I don't even have the source code
installed (because that's not the default in Debian's package manager:
I'd have to go out of my way to get the source code). Even if I had
the source code, it would be hard to figure out where the code
responsible for the behavior I want to change even is and I'd have to
restart the program to test any changes I make, probably several
times. With Emacs this is all a breeze, I can:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>jump directly to the source code of the command that I just used
(and if I don't know what command that is, or what keys I pressed to
cause it to run, I can ask that too);</li>
<li>make any modifications and try the new code immediately without
restarting Emacs;</li>
<li>when I get it right, I can add code to my personal configuration
incorporating the fix without touching the original source code.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I know myself: I <i>need</i> all of that convenience to fix problems or I
just won't do it. Most fixes take a few minutes and that's the only
reason I'm willing to make them. I've gotten pretty good at making
Emacs do <i>exactly</i> what I want and I'm not a software developer, I
imagine that for them the experience is even smoother!
