<p>On Sunday, Ecuadorians voted in a national referendum and rejected proposals to allow foreign military bases and to start a process that could lead to a new constitution, handing a setback to President Daniel Noboa&#x27;s agenda. The vote represented a clear majority against the basing proposal and against each of four constitutional options on the ballot. The measures had been pitched by the government as tools to combat organized crime and drug trafficking; President Noboa said he accepts the result and respects voters&#x27; decision.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qQXALo8YEaTlIFE5PSheghItDSYre2tm9q1raqDSc0VGYjPVKFSGJZTh0WQTPA5IRt9i3dzDpVJjbiMeLFcHnXQ6pWlT5UBCeR7U1Vl8nluUQqxyeeQ11GB7HCmPglrwGJd_PwWnARuLchK4cxr-PlDQZbX6yEzuXTeewkdmHw' alt='Ecuadorian voters reject proposals to host foreign military bases and rewrite the constitution' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Vote margins: With much of the count reported, the four reform options were trailing by margins ranging roughly 53%–61%, according to interim tallies published after voting closed.</li><li>Security rationale: Noboa&#x27;s administration and supporters argued foreign troops would help fight organized crime, drug trafficking and gang violence that have intensified in parts of Ecuador.</li><li>U.S. engagement: U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Ecuadorian military sites and met President Noboa in July while exploring closer security cooperation.</li><li>Basing offers: Mr. Noboa at various times floated locations including the Manta airbase, the coastal city of Salinas and an island in the Galapagos as possible sites for foreign deployments.</li></ul><blockquote>We consulted with the Ecuadorians, and they have spoken.
