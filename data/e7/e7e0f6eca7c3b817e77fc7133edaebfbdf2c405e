<p>Mark Friedman just released his Scheme-JS interpreter which is a Scheme with transparent JavaScript interoperability.
  See his blog post at <a href="https://furious-ideas.blogspot.com/2026/02/scheme-js-scheme-interpreter-with.html">furious ideas</a>.</p>

<p>This interpreter apparently uses the techniques of lightweight stack inspection &mdash; Mark consulted me a bit about that hack works.  I'm looking forward to seeing the vibe coded architecture.</p>
