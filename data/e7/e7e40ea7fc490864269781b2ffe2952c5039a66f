<p>Weeks of intense monsoon downpours, amplified by multiple tropical systems, have unleashed severe floods and landslides across parts of Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, leaving hundreds dead and many more missing in one of the region’s worst flood episodes in years. Indonesia’s Sumatra island has been hit especially hard, with national disaster officials reporting more than 300 fatalities across North Sumatra, West Sumatra and Aceh provinces, and large areas still cut off by damaged roads and landslides. Thailand has reported heavy casualties in southern provinces such as Songkhla, where water levels rose several metres, while Sri Lanka’s authorities say deaths from flooding and mudslides there have also risen sharply as aid slowly reaches isolated communities. Governments have begun large-scale rescue, evacuation and clean-up operations, including cloud-seeding efforts to reduce further rainfall in parts of Indonesia, as local communities, religious centres and emergency services work together to shelter displaced families and clear mud-filled homes.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/3di7cBrWqUGZe6pA95B7Srr6DpNnhFBgrIWVUw757KGTu77wS3CqQNWnfN7VpbIvtTctfMo7H2M0BTlCB8ek1ss5VjKM24jaJopVNAIdv8Rf' alt='Rescue workers in North Sumatra search through landslide debris after days of torrential rain.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Worst-hit Sumatra: Indonesia’s disaster agency reported that fatalities on Sumatra include separate tallies for North Sumatra, West Sumatra and Aceh provinces, while access to numerous communities remains blocked by landslides and damaged infrastructure.</li><li>Missing and stranded: Indonesian authorities said hundreds of residents are still unaccounted for and that thousands were at one point stranded on rooftops or in upper floors awaiting rescue in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia as waters rose quickly.</li><li>Desperate shortages: Local officials on Sumatra reported that some survivors have broken into shops and storage facilities in search of food and drinking water after nearly a week of disruption to normal supplies.</li><li>Community shelters: Residents described leaving damaged homes to sleep in crowded mosques and other improvised shelters, sharing whatever food is available while waiting for formal aid distributions to expand.</li><li>Medical pressures: In one heavily affected area of southern Thailand, hospital workers moved bodies into refrigerated trucks because the morgue had exceeded its normal capacity after the flooding.</li></ul><blockquote>We, the community, are working together to clean up the mud - Novia, resident of Pidie, Aceh</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Indonesia’s National Disaster Agency: Agency head Suharyanto said that tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from affected provinces on Sumatra, while teams struggle to reach remote areas and have started cloud-seeding flights in an effort to limit further rainfall over West Sumatra.
