<p>I figured out the attachment linking issues in Plain Org - it&rsquo;s not the path (it was the same) but the way the app renders images inside a logbook in emacs (or I guess maybe a &ldquo;drawer&rdquo;) - it just doesn&rsquo;t. Once the image link is out of the drawer, it works fine.</p>
<p>OK, it&rsquo;s time to start writing something a bit less cryptic and more detailed about my recent Emacs changes&hellip;</p>
