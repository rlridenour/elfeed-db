<p>The area code of the provided phone number I had never seen before. But I will say, while I rolled my eyes at Ollie’s bravado in discussing his employer initially, speaking to the man, my opinion changed almost instantaneously. It is hard to explain.

The topic of our conversation was to be <em>Ollie</em>. <em>He</em> was the one who needed to make a good impression via the telling of <em>his</em> supervisor. And yet, I found myself eager to please this man over the phone. Or, not exactly please him, but make a good impression. I wanted him to think of me as ‘nice.’ This impression seemed absolutely necessary, as did the inverse need, not to be thought of as ‘naughty.’</p>
