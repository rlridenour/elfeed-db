<p><strong>Chapter 4: Interior Tips</strong></p>
<p>As one approaches their stone tower or strolls the grounds surrounding their stone tower, one is never in doubt of their abode’s imposing height, nor of its relatively narrow girth. Inside a tower, however, one will find rooms, many of which would be indistinguishable from those in any other structure, save for the occasional rounded stone wall.</p>
<p>Mind you, this is nothing unique to the stone tower. Sprawling mansions still contain closets, and the door to a small bungalow might reveal an interior with vaulted ceilings and an open layout giving the impression of expansiveness. And some might see this–the incongruity of the outer and the inner regions of the structure–to be a strength. It allows one to <em>feel</em> as though they live in something distinctive without dealing with any inconveniences that said distinctiveness might present.</p>
<p>But for those who do not want to forget they live in a stone tower upon taking the first step into their stone tower, a few thoughtful design choices can help.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Center each room’s layout around its windows</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking for somewhere to install a few cozy chairs for reading and socialization? You might think to arrange them around the fireplace. But so many homes possess such a feature. Instead, arrange these chairs around a window, allowing you (and your guests) to peer out and be reminded of your altitude. Same goes for dining tables and desks. Any furniture you plan to spend much time in should be within easy viewing distance of a window to confirm exactly how high up you find yourself.</p>

<li><em>Do not fear inefficiency</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Logic would tell us that a stone tower dweller should cluster their essential rooms close to each other. The kitchen, the dining area, the master bedroom, the bathroom–it would make sense for all of these areas to be at the bottom of a stone tower, while its upper reaches might be devoted to rooms of lesser practicality. And yet, this is exactly he kind of thinking that drives many to live in structures that extend further across their plot of land than they do into the air. It is this author’s opinion that a bit of stair-climbing fitness is a small price to pay to be forever conscious of one’s uniquely tall confines. So put the kitchen halfway up, the dining area near the ground, and the master bathroom somewhere atop the structure, and work those legs!</p>

<p>A laptop? Something wide that flattens to nothing? No, thank you! Tower dwellers should use tower PCs exclusively. Similarly, a few round fans may be capable of moving the dank air through the stone-walled rooms efficiently enough. But so too could a pair of Vornado ATOM 1 Compact Oscillating Tower Circulators. And these, simply by virtue of their name and shape, will call to mind one’s chosen architecture, even when one is doing something as simply as trying to cool off or enjoy some white noise during the night.</p>
<p>Follow these three tips and your stone tower home will feel homey, stoney, and towery in equal measure!</p>
