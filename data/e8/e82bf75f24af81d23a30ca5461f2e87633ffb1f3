<p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced he had &quot;terminated&quot; trade negotiations with Canada after an Ontario provincial advertisement used audio from a 1987 Ronald Reagan speech criticizing tariffs, a move Mr. Trump said misrepresented the former president . Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he would pause the ad campaign effective Monday after speaking with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to allow trade talks to resume, and Ottawa said it stands ready to continue constructive discussions . The dispute drew attention because the spots were slated to air in U.S. markets during World Series broadcasts, prompting an unusually public diplomatic spat between the neighbours .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/QExDHH_Uxf-3aBrVhrnN_xojtF7x1C2nAj310WyP8tO3PfyeuwmhRpOKzWG2HT1uZnjyFZfeG6kttQbSNbGG2PPCE1oxQGz1sayqSRYM2bzBgu2c05iWzCSe9eE8ravnmq9nVlq8kbeC2JZZjmvP3bDLzvN6ZoF-451QiZyrO_c0rYx_ZTdliUvlrnUW78OrmOAEQBwmkNjSLn4m68iPr3L5ey4LvlTU0nXncoc7kkTJ7yGKj11XGoAU0gch0dmAJkB8RBFUycCUm5TOHA' alt='U.S. President Donald Trump stands in front of a painting of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan; Mr. Trump halted trade talks after an Ontario ad used Reagan audio.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>World Series timing: Ontario planned to place the 60‑second Reagan ad in U.S. markets during the first two World Series games to reach a broad American audience, a decision that helped escalate the row</li><li>Presidential response: President Trump posted that he had &quot;terminated&quot; negotiations and publicly accused Canada of a &quot;fake&quot; ad campaign, later saying he could &quot;play dirtier than they can,&quot; remarks reported while he was departing for Asia</li><li>Ottawa&#x27;s posture: Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada is ready to resume talks and that negotiators had made &quot;a lot of progress&quot; before the interruption, signaling willingness to return to the table quickly</li><li>Media analysis: Canadian commentary framed Mr. Trump&#x27;s abrupt halt as emblematic of his approach to foreign policy, with opinion pieces arguing the reaction reflected broader presidential tendencies</li></ul><blockquote>All trade negotiations with Canada are hereby terminated. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Donald Trump: Mr. Trump said the ad misrepresented Ronald Reagan and labeled the campaign &quot;fake,&quot; announcing that he had ended trade negotiations with Canada on social media .
