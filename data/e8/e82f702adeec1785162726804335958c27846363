Visa wants to pay Apple approximately &#36;100 million to be the new payment network for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/apple-card-visa-mastercard-deal-3ce762da">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>. As of right now, the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; is on the Mastercard payment network, but that is set to change because Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/15/goldman-sachs-apple-card-partnership-end-early/">ending its partnership</a> with Goldman Sachs.<br/>

Both American Express and Visa are vying to replace Mastercard as Apple's card services provider, while Mastercard is aiming to retain its position. Apple apparently plans to choose a new &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; network before it selects a partner to replace Goldman Sachs as the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;'s issuing bank, and competition is intense. Visa is offering Apple a &#36;100 million upfront payment, while American Express is "in the mix" and Mastercard is "fiercely trying" to retain its role.<br/>

Apple and Goldman Sachs have been working to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">dissolve their partnership</a> since 2023, with Goldman Sachs planning to exit the consumer banking market. JPMorgan Chase and Synchrony Financial are in talks with Apple to take over for Goldman Sachs, but American Express has also been aiming to become the issuer and network of the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;. Apple needs both an issuing bank for the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; and a payment network that facilitates transactions.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs and Apple have worked together on the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; since its 2019 launch, and have also teamed up for the high-yield Apple Savings account. Apple has not been happy with Goldman Sachs because of customer service issues caused by long wait times for disputed &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; transactions and savings account withdrawals.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau even <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-fed-probes-goldman-sachs-consumer-business-wsj-2023-01-20/">launched an investigation</a> into Goldman Sachs due to the customer complaints, which led to tension, so both companies are eager to end their relationship.<br/>
