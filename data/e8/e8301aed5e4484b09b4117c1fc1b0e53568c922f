<p>Following up on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/via-mastercard-apple-card">the previous item</a>, here’s a WSJ report from October on Visa’s dominant position in the payments industry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visa, based in San Francisco, has built its network over more than
60 years — going back to clunky manual credit-card readers and
carbon-paper copies of receipts. It accounts for around 60% of the
total dollar amount of U.S. debit-card purchases and about 50% of
U.S. credit-card purchases, according to the Nilson Report, a
trade publication. Its closest competitor, Mastercard, accounts
for around 22% and 23%, respectively. Visa’s profit totaled $17.3
billion in its 2023 fiscal year, after more than tripling in the
last decade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amex accounts for about 19% of U.S. credit card transactions (and doesn’t support debit), and Discover is down around 3 or 4%. I really thought Visa and Mastercard had comparable market share, but it turns out Visa is far bigger, and it’s Mastercard and Amex that are around the same size.</p>
