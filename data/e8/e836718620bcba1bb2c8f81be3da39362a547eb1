God of grace and love, <br></br> <br></br>
History is filled <br></br>
With names like <br></br>
Alexander, <br></br>
Hannibal, <br></br>
Caesar, <br></br>
Napoleon; <br></br>
Men who took up arms, <br></br>
And with violence, <br></br>
Bent the world to their will. <br></br> <br></br>
But history whispers <br></br>
Of others, <br></br>
The faceless ones, <br></br>
Who were deemed <br></br>
To insignificant to name. <br></br> <br></br>
We think of the woman <br></br>
Who, with her daughter, <br></br>
Gave her son to the Nile, <br></br>
Yet found a way to get him back, <br></br>
And by saving her son, <br></br>
Saved a people from their bondage. <br></br> <br></br>
The world sees those <br></br>
Who bear swords, <br></br>
And calls them heroic. <br></br>
What greater courage <br></br>
Has the one <br></br>
Who faces the sword <br></br>
With compassion and love? <br></br></p>

 <p>
Amen
