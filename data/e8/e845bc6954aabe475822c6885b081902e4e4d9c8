<p>A severe heatwave-driven bushfire outbreak in Australia’s southeast has burned vast areas of Victoria, destroying hundreds of structures, including homes, and causing one death, authorities said. Victoria declared a state of disaster/state of emergency to expand powers for evacuations as thousands of firefighters continued working on multiple blazes expected to last for days or longer. Officials warned that conditions can still change quickly, including the possibility of new ignitions from lightning. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited affected towns and urged residents to follow evacuation orders as damage assessments continued.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/9EhTwQ_dHeOFSfP2wuAcvgCX8sumgMk0ToQ2Qqvp5zxt-YcoSUttl7ID6YNiqYEzOYlPjN87oe6PLXq-WlEExSBLWo5cCeSHnel6vH3l' alt='A man inspects damage to his property amid bushfires in Harcourt, Victoria.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Emergency powers: Victoria’s premier said the disaster declaration is designed to protect lives by enabling authorities to compel evacuations where needed.</li><li>Fire footprint: One of the most destructive fires burned close to 150,000 hectares near Longwood, with photos showing an orange-glowing night sky over bushland.</li><li>People located: Officials said three people previously missing within a high-risk fireground were found.</li><li>Rural losses: Emergency officials reported damage beyond houses, including impacts on livestock, cropping land and vineyards.</li><li>Warning tiers: As some fires were downgraded to “watch and act,” authorities maintained emergency warnings for other active blazes across Victoria.</li></ul><blockquote>It’s all about one thing: protecting Victorian lives - Jacinta Allan</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Victoria state government: The premier framed the disaster declaration and evacuation enforcement as a life-protection measure, urging people told to leave to do so immediately.
