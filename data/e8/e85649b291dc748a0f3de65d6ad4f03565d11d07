 
          <p>This <a href="/post/2025/12/getting-emacs-and-macos-to-play-nice">Emacs thing</a> is getting out of hand and eating away all my free time. Now I know what they mean with the saying &ldquo;diving into a rabbit hole&rdquo; (and never seeing the bottom of it). We&rsquo;re at 1k lines of Elisp code and I still add items to the <code>TODO</code> list that don&rsquo;t work well enough on a daily basis. For some weird reason, I decided to try my hand at using Emacs as an email client as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, we can save those boring technical details for another post you can safely skip then, but for now, let&rsquo;s stick with the philosophical implications of messing with my email schedule and/or habits. I&rsquo;ve had some dirty habits that I thought kicked the bucket way back in 2021 when I <a href="/post/2022/02/visualizing-personal-data-takeouts">threw out everything Google-related</a>. Except that I didn&rsquo;t throw out much&mdash;I just started doing something else.</p>
<p>My Google &amp; GMail account still lives but now primarily serves as yet another spam address. But I forgot to clean up and process the archive! I had another account lying around (<code>jefklak@gmail.com</code>) that I stopped using in 2013-ish but I forgot to clean up and process those archives as well! The Google Takeout as backup I saved, but the original ones I didn&rsquo;t delete, meaning my data was still out there. Whoops. The question is: what to do with a bunch of very old emails? Do you save them all? Locally or centrally? Which ones?</p>
<p>I had to think about this because the Emacs package I use&mdash;excellent Dutch software called <a href="https://djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/index.html">mu4e</a>&mdash;works with IMAP. I still rocked POP3 so I moved to IMAP. But in IMAP, you synchronize between client and server, meaning most stuff stays on the server which I don&rsquo;t like. Why keep an <code>/Archive</code> IMAP folder in there just accumulating junk to wire up and down? And should I dump my GMail archive in there as well?</p>
<p>Since moving from GMail (<a href="/post/2023/01/goodbye-protonmail">and then Protonmail</a>), my preferred mail client has been Apple Mail. I want a proper application for working with email, not a webapp, and I don&rsquo;t want any email near my smartphone (so I don&rsquo;t really care about syncing that much, which is why I stayed with POP). Nothing is stopping you from creating a folder &ldquo;On My Mac&rdquo; and moving stuff in there instead of pressing the <em>Archive</em> button&mdash;in that way, the email disappears from the server. But then it ends up in a proprietary database format. Now, it&rsquo;s all just flat text files syncing with <code>mbsync</code> and auto-backed up with various stuff.</p>
<p>But perhaps you still want a semi-permanent archive folder to sync just in case? I&rsquo;m a zero inbox kind of guy: once the mail has been dealt with, it needs to go:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it spam? Move to junk &amp; have your filter learn from it.</li>
<li>Is it a short thing that you can answer (if needed) and forget about? Delete.</li>
<li>Is it informational/an invite/whatever that you can move to a calendar? Do it &amp; delete.</li>
<li>Is it an invoice/whatever where you can save the attach into the DEVONThink inbox? Do it &amp; delete.</li>
<li>Is it a receipt without attach? Print as PDF and treat as above.</li>
<li>Is it an email from family full of photos of last Saturday&rsquo;s party? Save them all to your NAS where Photoprism can find them &amp; delete.</li>
<li>Is it from an ongoing project that you still need to keep as evidence just in case? Move to the &ldquo;projects&rdquo; folder.</li>
<li>Is it an exciting email from friends, co-bloggers, et al.? Answer &amp; archive to save.</li>
</ol>
<p>That means my folders look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>- Archive/
- brainbaking/
	| Drafts/
	| INBOX/
	| Junk/
	| Mailinglists/
	| Projects/
	| Sent/
	| TempArchive/
	| Trash/
</code></pre><p>Why isn&rsquo;t <code>Archive/</code> inside the <code>brainbaking/</code> folder? Because that&rsquo;s outside IMAP sync zone. <code>TempArchive/</code> is there in case I need something synced, but it&rsquo;s rarely used and I plan to delete it in the coming months. <code>Projects/</code> will serve as the semi-saved &ldquo;ongoing thing but don&rsquo;t need to deal with right now but can&rsquo;t get rid of just yet&rdquo; folder.</p>
<p>But what about <code>Mailinglists/</code>? That&rsquo;s simple: I set up rules that automatically move emails to that folder to only occasionally glance at. For example, our daughter&rsquo;s preschool loves to send at least four days a week titled &ldquo;NEW MESSAGE IN PARENT PLATFORM!!!!!ONE!!11&rdquo;. Ah, and yes, that Limited Run Games mailing list? *Cough*. Yeah, that one that I shouldn&rsquo;t be looking at. In it goes: at least it&rsquo;s not staring at me in <code>INBOX/</code>.</p>
<p>Now about that (local) archive. Why keep emails around? Several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&rsquo;t say goodbye to them. Several conversations with my late father-in-law and other deceased where I honestly don&rsquo;t have the courage to trash them permanently.</li>
<li>They were meaningful to me. Same as above, I guess, except for these people are still alive? I like keeping emails from lovely folks around.</li>
<li>They might still have a practical use. Since all mails are indexed by <code>mu</code>, I can quickly whip up a search and find stuff not stored elsewhere. It should, though.</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, I am an opponent of blindfully preserving everything &ldquo;just in case&rdquo;. You don&rsquo;t need that email invoice if you have the invoice stored. You don&rsquo;t need that project mail if the project was done and buried five years ago. You don&rsquo;t need those superficial &ldquo;sure I&rsquo;ll be there&rdquo; appointment emails once the event is over. I hate it when people say <em>Just Save Everything, Dude, It&rsquo;s GMail!</em>. To me, that sounds like <em>I&rsquo;m Too Lazy To Filter, Dude! Where&rsquo;s My Stuff?</em> &mdash;although that&rsquo;s also a perfectly valid strategy.</p>
<p>But then again, that might just be me. How do you deal with your emails? What&rsquo;s your grand archival plan? Send me a mail and let me know! If it&rsquo;s interesting enough I&rsquo;ll promise to keep it indefinitely.</p>
