Eli Zaretskii <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2025-05/msg00409.html">has announced that the first pretest for Emacs 30.2</a> is now available for testing. That&rsquo;s great news. It&rsquo;s nice to see that development is proceeding apace with the planned bug releases between the—more or less—yearly major releases.

As I always say, if you don&rsquo;t mind living on the edge a tiny bit, download and test this new release. And as I also always say, thanks to Eli and all the other developers who give so much to our community. They&rsquo;re real heroes and deserve the gratitude of us all.</p>
