<p>Thousands of people protested across Australia over the visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog, with large rallies in Sydney and Melbourne. Herzog’s multi-city trip was billed as a show of solidarity with Australia’s Jewish community and as a chance to honour victims of the Bondi Beach shooting. In Sydney, a demonstration outside Town Hall escalated into clashes after police enforced restrictions around the site and moved to clear access. Officers used pepper spray, and reports said multiple people were arrested. Australian leaders urged calm as police defended their actions, while officials said they would investigate “concerning” footage from the rally.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/t01OTl_mFcMczTG9NgxAsapbda1neL6MuKNQ-sO-Q2shNSNhlWl2He1HACA63FppK07azGlJ3ZAi6ecg4vE_vLbMPCBJLjKlGJJTW068ghcC' alt='Pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrate in Sydney against Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s visit, Feb. 9, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Crowd bottleneck: Reporting from the scene said police restricted movement at most exits from the Town Hall square, creating gridlock as some tried to leave while others called to march.</li><li>Footage scrutiny: Videos from the rally appeared to show officers punching protesters and dragging away men who were praying, prompting sharper calls for accountability.</li><li>Protest limits: Organisers’ plans to march through Sydney were shaped by a court decision that upheld police powers to restrict protests, according to reporting from the event.</li><li>Visit security: Reporting described Herzog’s trip as a tightly secured, multi-day visit that drew protests in several cities.</li><li>Media impact: Journalist Peter Lalor said police pepper-sprayed him while he was covering the protest, adding to reports that some media were caught up in crowd-control measures.</li></ul><blockquote>It’s worth remembering they did everything possible to avoid that confrontation, starting last week when they begged protest organisers to have it in Hyde Park, where it was safe and a march could take place. - Chris Minns</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>NSW Police: Police said they made 27 arrests and alleged that 10 people assaulted officers after police moved to clear access for pedestrians at the protest site.
