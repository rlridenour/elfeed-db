Apple's primary <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> manufacturer Foxconn has invested &#36;1.5 billion into India, signaling a significant acceleration in Apple's efforts to shift &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; production away from China, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-19/apple-partner-hon-hai-injects-1-5-billion-into-india-unit"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>.<br/>

The investment was disclosed in a stock exchange filing by Foxconn, which has been actively expanding its manufacturing footprint in southern India in recent years. The company is also increasing its investment in the United States. <br/>
<br/>
The move comes as Apple continues to diversify its production base away from China, which has long served as the cornerstone of its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; manufacturing. India has emerged as Apple's most critical alternative manufacturing hub. <br/>
<br/>
Apple reportedly assembled &#36;22 billion worth of iPhones in India during the 12 months ending in March 2025, a nearly 60% increase over the previous year. Foxconn, Tata Electronics, and Pegatron now operates facilities in India focused on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; manufacturing. Apple is apparently aiming to manufacture the majority of iPhones sold in the United States in India by the end of 2026. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/">Foxconn</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/foxconn-pours-1-billion-into-india/">iPhone Maker Foxconn Pours &#36;1.5 Billion Into India Manufacturing Efforts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-maker-foxconn-pours-1-5-billion-into-india-manufacturing-efforts.2457332/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
