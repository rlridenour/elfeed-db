Below, we recap what is new in the Messages app on iOS 26:<ul><li><strong>Polls:</strong> You can now create polls in group chats, allowing people to vote on topics or questions, such as which restaurant to go to. Apple Intelligence can detect when a poll might come in handy and suggest one.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Backgrounds:</strong> You can now add a background to any conversation, and all participants will see it. You can choose from Apple's selection of backgrounds, or you can set any of your own photos as a background. You can turn off conversation backgrounds in the Settings app if desired.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple Cash in group chats:</strong> You can now send and receive Apple Cash in group chats.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Typing indicators in group chats:</strong> You can now see who is typing in group chats.</li><br/>
<li><strong>"Add Contact" button in group chats:</strong> This button makes it easier to add people to the Contacts app in group chats.</li><br/>
<li><strong>"Select" option:</strong> When you tap and hold on a message bubble, a new "Select" option appears. Tapping on it allows you to select a portion of text in a message, whereas you could previously only copy an entire message.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Unknown sender screening:</strong> This new option automatically moves messages from unknown senders to the Unknown Senders folder, and hides notifications for them until you accept them. The app can also detect spam and move it to a new Spam folder, with notifications for these messages also hidden.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Natural language search:</strong> You can now search for photos within a conversation by describing what you are looking for. Examples: "Eric skateboarding in a tie-dye shirt," or "Juli with stickers on her face."</li><br/>
<li><strong>Photo previews:</strong> When a new "Send Photo Previews" setting is turned on, the Messages app will only send a lower-quality preview of a photo while an iPhone is in Low Data Mode. The full photo will be sent later.</li><br/>
<li><strong>End-to-end encryption for RCS:</strong> In March, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/15/ios-19-rcs-upgrades/">announced</a> that it planned to add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to the Messages app in a future iOS update, which is likely to be iOS 26, or a later version like iOS 26.1. This change would prevent Apple and any other third party from being able to read RCS messages and attachments while they are being sent between devices, as has always been the case with iMessage blue bubbles.</li></ul>iOS 26 is available now in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-ios-26-developer-beta/">developer beta</a>, with a public beta to follow next month. The update will be released later this year for the iPhone 11 and newer.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/11/ios-26-new-messages-app-features/">iOS 26 Will Add 10 New Features to the Messages App on Your iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-will-add-10-new-features-to-the-messages-app-on-your-iphone.2458765/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
