<p>Over time in Micro.blog, I started forming a habit of blog &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; that I usually do, whether or not I have a post waiting. Habit for my blog? This means an org-mode capture template!</p>
<p>But even if you don&rsquo;t use Emacs, you might find some of the steps helpful. Here it is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>    *Blog Stuff
    
    - [ ] tinylytics
      - [ ] most popular posts in the last month
      - [ ] most popular countries?
    - [ ] new webmentions (under *Account* on the Micro.blog site)?
    - [ ] Linkrot:
      - [ ] &quot;On this day&quot; if exist:
        - [ ] check for typos
        - [ ] check for links/broken images/missing emojis
      - [ ] if no post, see OTD below
    - [ ] check plugins
    - [ ] photo page / movies page fixes
    
     **If you need a post (OTD):
    
    - Check RSS feeds for stuff to save and comment on
    - Fosstodon (check the org-mode feed)
    - Reddit (org-mode)
    - Journal
    - Take a random picture? of something you like
</code></pre><p>First, I want to check on <a href="https://tinylytics.app/">TinyLytics</a>, which is a privacy-conscious analytics tool, kind of like Google Analytics, just not as evil. TL tells me which days I get more traffic, and for which pages (which usually translates to posts). It&rsquo;s no surprise that my more popular posts are Emacs or org-mode related.</p>
<p>TL also tells me which browsers are the most popular on my site (Firefox bit Safari recently, Chrome is a close third), which operating systems (macOS, no big surprise, followed by Linux, which is not shocking considering where I hang out online), and which countries (USA is first by a long shot, but Germany has always been second which I find interesting).</p>
<p>Webmentions are something I&rsquo;m still not too clear about. I set it up on my site a while back, but usually my blog gets mentioned on someone&rsquo;s list of lists, which seems automated. Every now and then though someone mentions me directly from their blog, and I&rsquo;d love to thank them for that, so this is what it&rsquo;s for.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkrot">Linkrot</a> is important for anyone who has a site, I think. It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward. For plugins, I check to see if a new version exists on the backend of Micro.blog. Finally, since a change that was introduced on Micro.blog a while back, some of the images on my Photos page shouldn&rsquo;t be there (it sometimes captures screenshots or other boring photos that are not really worthy being on the photo page), and then the Movies page needs a &ldquo;kick&rdquo; sometimes - refreshing and rebuilding the site so it captures the RSS feed from letterboxd, which is where I post my movie reviews which get synced into the site.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;if you need a post&rdquo; refers to On This Day but also in general. It lists a couple of good places to get some ideas. I am a bit better these days at &ldquo;unjournaling&rdquo; some of my personal journal entries and posting them on my blog.</p>
