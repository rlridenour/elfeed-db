GNU Emacs. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">standard-light</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">standard-dark</code> emulate the
out-of-the-box looks of Emacs (which technically do NOT constitute a
theme) while bringing to them thematic consistency, customizability,
and extensibility. Other themes are stylistic variations of those.</p>

<p>In practice, the Standard themes take the default style of the
font-lock and Org faces, complement it with a wider and harmonious
colour palette, address many inconsistencies, and apply established
semantic patterns across all interfaces by supporting a large number
of packages.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Version 3.0.0 on 2025-11-09</h2>

<p>This major version makes Standard build on top of my Modus themes. The
latter provides extensive face/package coverage and a wide range of
customisation options. As a result, the Standard themes retain their
design while giving more control to the user.</p>

<p>These release notes are essentially the same as what I wrote earlier
today for my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef-themes</code> package, which is now also built on top of my
Modus themes: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-11-09-emacs-ef-themes-2-0-0/">https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2025-11-09-emacs-ef-themes-2-0-0/</a>.</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User options that were provided by the Standard themes are now mere
aliases for their Modus counterparts.</li>
  <li>Commands that were defined by the Standard themes are now reduced to
convenience wrappers that build on top of Modus.</li>
  <li>The new minor mode <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">standard-themes-take-over-modus-themes-mode</code> can
be enabled to make all Modus commands that load a theme only
consider the Standard themes. This is effectively the opposite of
enabling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-include-derivatives-mode</code> or using one of
the Standard commands to load just a Standard theme (like
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">standard-themes-rotate</code>).</li>
  <li>The manual of the Modus themes covers everything from the basics to
advanced topics on how to use and customise the themes. Evaluate
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(info "(modus-themes) Top")</code> or visit <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes">https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes</a>.</li>
