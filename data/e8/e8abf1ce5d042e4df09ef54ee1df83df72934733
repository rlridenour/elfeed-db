Apple is expected to implement a &#36;50 price increase across its iPhone 17 lineup when the new models launch in September as a way to offset rising component costs and China tariffs, according to a new <a href="https://x.com/DeItaone/status/1950502871545356352">investor note</a> by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee.<br/>
