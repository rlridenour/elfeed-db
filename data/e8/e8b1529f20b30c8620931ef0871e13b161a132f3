<blockquote>
  <p>This comes just a few months after <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/musk-x-xai/">xAI acquired X</a>, one
year after Musk <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html">shifted</a> a bunch of Tesla-bound Nvidia GPUs
to xAI, and just a few years after he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-pulled-50-tesla-employees-twitter-takeover-rcna54946">used staff</a> from
Tesla to work on Twitter. So, to recap: he has moved people and
resources from two publicly traded companies to two privately
owned ones, has used funds from one of his privately owned
companies to buy another one of his privately owned companies, and
is now using one of his <s>publicly traded</s> privately owned
companies to give billions of dollars to (another) one of his
privately owned ones.</p>

<p>Musk can and should be able to do whatever he wants with his privately held companies, like X Corp and SpaceX. But the way he treats Tesla Motors, which is publicly traded, as though it’s just part of his personal fiefdom is absurd. And the European Commission <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2024/10/17/musk-empire-risks-being-targeted-by-eu-for-potential-x-fines/">isn’t fooled</a>.</p>
