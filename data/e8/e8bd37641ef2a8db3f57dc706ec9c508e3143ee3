<p>There&#8217;s power in owning your words.</p>



<p>At Tom&#8217;s IT Cafe, we built a fully self-hosted Matrix Synapse server &#8211; secured, encrypted, and tuned for reliability.</p>



<span id="more-8279"></span>



<p>The setup runs behind an Nginx reverse proxy, wrapped with Let&#8217;s Encrypt certificates for trusted TLS, and rate-limited to resist noise.</p>



<p><br>A TURN server handles voice and video bridging, while PostgreSQL and routine backups ensure consistency and resilience.</p>



<p><br>It&#8217;s not an experiment anymore; it&#8217;s production-grade communication, built to last.</p>



<p>In a world that normalizes surveillance, <em>privacy is no longer a luxury-it&#8217;s survival</em>.</p>



<p><br>For small and mid-sized enterprises, sealed local communication means that client data, internal strategy, and private exchanges never leave trusted ground.</p>



<p><br>No third-party logging. No data mining. No silent observers in the stream.</p>



<p>The setup is not open-sourced in full, because true security is never copy-paste &#8211; it&#8217;s design, context, and discipline.</p>



<p><br>But if your organization values control and confidentiality, Tom&#8217;s IT Cafe can build and maintain a hardened Matrix communication server for you.</p>
