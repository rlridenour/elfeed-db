Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis confirmed that a fourth season was being written back in March. He suggested there would be new characters and a new storyline, with the show taking place in the United States. Titular character Ted Lasso will be coaching a women's soccer team, a departure from the UK men's team featured in the initial three seasons.<br/>

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/15/ted-lasso-season-three-launch/">released the third season</a> of the show in March 2023, so there has already been a two-year pause between season three and season four. There is no word yet on when filming will finish, or when season four will launch.<br/>
<br/>
Ted Lasso is one of Apple's most popular TV shows, and the first three seasons have won several awards. In the series, Sudeikis plays a college football coach from Kansas who is hired to coach a professional soccer team in England, even though he has little experience with soccer. <br/>
<br/>
Season three wrapped up with Ted Lasso returning home, in what seemed to be a series finale. Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham recently told <em><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/columns/hannah-waddingham-thrilled-ted-lasson-season-4-1236459995/">Variety</a></em> that reviving the show for season four was akin to exhuming the corpse of a beloved dog that had been buried. She said she wanted to know what happened to her character, so she's "thrilled that it’s been exhumed."<br/>
<br/>
Jason Sudeikis, Hannah Waddingham, Jeremy Swift, and Juno Temple are all in the image that Cook shared today. It's unclear if other cast members are set to return.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/21/ted-lasso-season-4-filming/">Filming for &#039;Ted Lasso&#039; Season 4 Underway</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/filming-for-ted-lasso-season-4-underway.2461912/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
