<p>The US State Department said it revoked the visas of six foreign nationals after reviewing social media posts that officials said celebrated or made light of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, announcing the decision on Tuesday [dw.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][newarab.com#1][scmp.com#1]. The department stated the US &quot;has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans&quot; and indicated it is continuing to identify additional cases; the individuals were not named and are from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa [dw.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][straitstimes.com#1][newarab.com#1]. The move came the same day President Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom; Kirk was killed on September 10 while speaking at a Utah college campus [newarab.com#1][scmp.com#1]. The administration has increased social media vetting since taking office in January, while critics say the broader campaign has raised free speech concerns amid reports of firings and disciplinary actions over comments about Kirk [dw.com#1][newarab.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/cDHdEEt9HoP0qnsnLWtB6oS4PNroJWjB8d9nJzszddjH1gTENprmYO82x8jjxqRKz7Y3F7OfvjY85tvu6rr6vApOu07FEN8jaHg-9zLVuM8hp0LUTEXEIDpAyJacv-IYt4G6vSokvhbLEw6CI4pjL8TiOFtIoQdStbNjees8l3tBel39NeDHe4sG-9OWL_9JWXEaxZVN7XXZOaJwtKGfJeWwJPG_dodxcw15UtKRmjqzs8N9b4gpS6yHVb3ret1QZzKm-QlZA4yjshNPmzTf' alt='The State Department said it revoked six visas after reviewing posts about Charlie Kirk’s killing.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who was affected: Those losing visas were not identified publicly and are from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa [aljazeera.com#1][newarab.com#1].</li><li>Ongoing reviews: Officials said they continue to identify visa holders who celebrated the assassination and suggested more revocations could follow [straitstimes.com#1][ft.com#1].</li><li>Reporting push: Officials, including the Deputy Secretary of State, urged the public to flag offensive posts about Kirk, reflecting an active monitoring effort [newarab.com#1].</li><li>Event context: Kirk was killed on September 10 while speaking at a Utah college campus, prompting widespread online discourse [scmp.com#1].</li><li>Vetting emphasis: The administration has ramped up social media vetting since taking office in January [dw.com#1].</li></ul><blockquote>No obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans. - US State Department</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US State Department: Said the US has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans and vowed to enforce immigration laws against those celebrating assassinations.
