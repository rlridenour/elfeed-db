Tesla is working to add support for Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> in its vehicles, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/tesla-is-working-to-add-apple-carplay-in-bid-to-boost-vehicle-sales">Mark Gurman reports</a>.<br/>

Tesla vehicles rely on its own infotainment software system, which integrates vehicle functions, navigation, music, web browsing, and more. The automaker has been an outlier in foregoing support for Apple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, which has otherwise become an industry standard feature, allowing users to mirror their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> apps to their in-car infotainment screen.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Tesla seems to have abruptly reversed course and apparently intends to add support for the highly requested feature. Apple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; for Tesla vehicles is said to now be in testing, according to several individuals familiar with the matter. The company has purportedly discussed a roll out of feature "in the coming months," but release plans are not yet finalized and it could come at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
Tesla's adoption of &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will involve the feature operating "within a window inside its broader interface," rather than being a full-screen experience like it is in most vehicles. Tesla's implementation will also be the standard version of wireless &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, rather than the next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Ultra that started rolling out earlier this year. <br/>
<br/>
Tesla apparently hopes that adding support for Apple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will help boost sales, with some prospective buyers citing the lack of &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; support as a reason for not choosing the company's cars.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tesla/">Tesla</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wireless-carplay/">Wireless CarPlay</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/13/tesla-to-add-carplay-support/">Tesla Working to Add Apple CarPlay Support to Vehicles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tesla-working-to-add-apple-carplay-support-to-vehicles.2471098/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
