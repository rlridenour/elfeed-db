<p>From that same Reuters report by Akash Sriram <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/unchanging_prices_vs_nonsensical_tariffs">that I just wrote about</a>, speculating that iPhone prices might rise dramatically under Trump’s tariffs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, other analysts noted that iPhone sales have been
floundering in the company’s major markets, as Apple
Intelligence, a suite of features that helps summarize
notifications, rewrite emails and give users access to ChatGPT,
has failed to enthuse buyers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Merriam-Webster defines <em><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flounder">flounder</a></em> thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>: to struggle to move or obtain footing : thrash about wildly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s Jason Snell’s chart of iPhone sales <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/01/apples-reports-record-revenue-for-q1-2025/">through their most recent quarterly report</a> — a record-breaking quarter for the company overall — covering the last three calendar months of 2024:</p>

<p>It’s certainly up for debate whether Apple Intelligence is an effective marketing driver for iPhone sales. I mean that with no snark. Maybe Apple Intelligence <em>is</em> driving iPhone sales. I don’t know why people have purchased new iPhones in the last six months. Neither do you, and neither do the “other analysts” (conveniently unnamed) cited by Reuters. But what we do know, because Apple reports the revenue numbers, is that iPhone sales have been remarkably flat, year-over-year, for the last 13 quarters.</p>
