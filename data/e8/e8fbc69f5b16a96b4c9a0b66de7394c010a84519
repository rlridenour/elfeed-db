<p>Wes Davis, The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646809/ftc-v-meta-antitrust-monopoly-trial-instagram-whatsapp">Meta’s antitrust trial today</a>, lawyers representing
Apple, Google, and Snap each expressed irritation with Meta over
the slides it presented on Monday that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648893/meta-redacted-documents-leak-ftc-antitrust-opening-statement">The Verge found to
contain</a> easy-to-remove redactions. Attorneys for both Apple
and Snap called the errors “egregious,” with Apple’s
representative indicating that it may not be able to trust Meta
with its internal information in the future. Google’s attorney
also blamed Meta for jeopardizing the search giant’s data with the
mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is yet another one of those situations where the botched redactions were just objects layered atop the supposed-to-be-redacted material in a PDF file, leaving the original layer’s content intact but just visually occluded. In 2025 you either have to be really bad with computers to do this, or you did it this way on purpose. Perhaps we should apply Occam’s razor and presume it’s just Meta displaying their usual regard for privacy.</p>

<p>You can properly redact a PDF digitally, but botched digital redactions are so commonplace (and at times disastrous and/or humiliating) that when then Attorney General William Barr released the Mueller Report in 2019, the DOJ printed the unredacted original, did the redactions on paper, <a href="https://pdfa.org/a-technical-and-cultural-assessment-of-the-mueller-report-pdf/">and then scanned it back in to create the redacted PDF</a>.</p>
