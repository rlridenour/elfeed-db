</ul><h1>Out Of Sight</h1><p>You know what’s a weird bit of math?</p>
<p>Every day you wear one of four t-shirts, five pairs of shorts, or three pairs of jeans. You’ve got those two sweaters and two sweatshirts for when it gets cool, a rain slicker, and a bigger coat for the winter.</p>
<p>That’s not many clothes.</p>
<p>And yet, somehow, your drawers are totally packed. Like, you can barely close them a lot of the time. They’re basically overflowing with apparel.</p>
<p>So, what’s the story there?</p>
<p>Well, it’s pretty simple: you’ve got a lot of items that you never actually wear. Does this make you a full-blown hoarder? Absolutely not. It does, however, result in a cluttered closet.</p>
<p>So, why don’t you cull the herd a little bit, so to speak? Go through some of those shirts you never put on anymore and decide which ones can stay and which need to take a trip to the thrift store.</p>
<p>Let’s start here: it’s a 3-sizes-too-big long-sleeve tee commemorating your ex-girlfriend’s family reunion, which you attended as her plus-one. You can’t possibly get rid of that! It’s such a great conversation piece. Or, it would be, if it didn’t fit you like a poncho.</p>
<p>Here’s another: this one was from the annual softball game you played in graduate school against a rival department. Another definite keeper! Sure, you don’t actually work in a field related to your degree, and, yeah, to a certain extent, that bugs you, and, actually, pulling this thing out of the drawer just now filled you with a sense of failure and dread. And okay, to be honest, you’ve put on a little weight since those days, and also you ran it through the dryer a few too many times, shrinking it further. But, like, weren’t you just talking a few months ago about trying Keto?</p>
<p>Oh, check this one out: it’s the shirt you got for running a 5k, an old one at that, considering it’s from a time before all such offerings were of the moisture-wicking variety. It’s a bit splotchy from that time you wore it while repainting the living room, but you could probably still wear it mowing. At least, on days when your shirt that says ‘Mow grass, mow problems’ is dirty.</p>
<p>You know what? Here’s an idea: let’s just kick this can down the road a bit. Load those shirts (and maybe some shorts, and maybe a few other things, too) into some of these underbed storage bags and shove them somewhere. That way, you don’t have to get rid of them, but at least they’re out of the way.</p>
<p>Wow, what a great solution!</p>
<p>Now, let’s talk about your bookshelf. Sure are a lot of books piling up, aren’t there?</p>
