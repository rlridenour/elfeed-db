<p>While we already have lots of note-taking apps on iOS, I wanted a minimal <code>*scratch*</code> area (à la Emacs), so I built one.</p>

<p>What's the use-case? You're on the go. Someone's telling you directions, or a phone number, name of a restaurant, anything really… you just need to write it down <em>right now, quickly</em>!</p>
<p>No time to create a new contact, a note, a file, or spend time on additional taps, bring up keyboard… You just want to write it somewhere with the least amount of friction.</p>

<p>Being an Emacs and org user, I had to sprinkle the app with basic markup support for headings, lists and checkboxes. Also, having a <code>*scratch*</code> &quot;buffer&quot; on my iPhone gives me that warm emacsy fuzzy feeling :)</p>
<p>You can download <code>*scratch*</code> from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/scratch/id1671420139">App Store</a>.</p>
<p>Find it useful? Please help me spread the word. Tell your friends.</p>
