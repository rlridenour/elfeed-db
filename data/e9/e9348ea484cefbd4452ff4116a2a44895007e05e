<h3>Base iPhone 17 Pro Could Cost &#36;200 More But With Doubled Storage</h3><br/>
Pricing estimates for the iPhone 17 lineup are all over the place, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/04/base-iphone-17-pro-cost-200-more-double-storage/">some sources expecting price increases</a> for at least the iPhone 17 Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/04/iphone-17-air-price-1099-256gb-base-storage/">potentially for the iPhone 17 Air</a> compared to the current Plus-model price point.<br/>
<br/>

Those price increases could, however, see some storage capacity bumps at those starting prices to help cushion the blow for some customers.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Under One Week Until iPhone 17: Here's What We Know</h3><br/>
The base iPhone 17 will be the cheapest of the new flagship lineup, and while it should get some welcome upgrades, it will probably the tamest update Apple has in store.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iPhone-17-Base-Model-Rumored-to-Come-in-New-Green-and-Purple-Colors-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2724" height="1533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007176" /><br/>
While we should get some new color options, the overall form factor should be nearly identical to the iPhone 16. It will get the usual chip and camera upgrades, potentially a display update for 120Hz ProMotion, and a range of additional improvements. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-iphone-17-rumors/">Read up on everything we're expecting in our dedicated overview.</a><br/>

<h3>Foldable iPhone Coming in 2026, Foldable iPad to Follow in 2028</h3><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/02/foldable-iphone-foldable-ipad-launch-dates/">release a foldable iPhone in 2026</a>, and will then follow it up with a foldable iPad in 2028, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/Apple-Foldable-Thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015809" /><br/>
Multiple sources have now confirmed that Apple is planning to release its first foldable ‌iPhone‌ in 2026, with the device coming as part of the iPhone 18 lineup. Launch timing on a larger-screened foldable device has been more uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Lighter, Cheaper Vision Air Coming in 2027</h3><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/02/vision-air-2027/">release a lighter weight and more affordable version of the Vision Pro in 2027</a>, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/Midnight-Vision-Pro-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-999091" /><br/>
The upcoming device, which he refers to as the "Vision Air," will supposedly be over 40 percent lighter than the current model. The Vision Pro weighs in at round 1.375 pounds, so a version that's 40 percent lighter should come in at under a pound.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo also says the Vision Air will be over 50 percent cheaper, which could make it much more attractive to prospective buyers. The Vision Pro costs &#36;3,499, which means a half-priced version would be &#36;1,750.<br/>
