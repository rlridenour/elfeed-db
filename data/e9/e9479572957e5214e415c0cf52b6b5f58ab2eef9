<p>Israel&#x27;s military chief, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, pledged on Wednesday to halt a recent surge in settler violence in the occupied West Bank after troops arrested several settlers following clashes near Tulkarem that left Palestinians injured and property damaged, with four people evacuated for medical treatment. President Isaac Herzog also publicly condemned the attacks as &quot;shocking&quot; and said they must end, a rare high‑level rebuke that added political pressure on authorities to act. The United Nations&#x27; Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said October was the worst month on record for settler attacks since it began recording incidents in 2006, reporting 264 attacks that caused casualties or property damage.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/-NjUdacG-vX3gCzCUzbB6hgAa2-qirUgU-IAsV2svdInv7t0Jgm3YOqtFTglqfnU34O3-aWQKZ8RQuRUyjA80BSi8BtjwoClI5P5Jp-N_e2LIOINRA1_maBiTILNl9H7Wo99klLEsruX20fgMO4ISqIF-GHkbKv5GA0sBlm_8a5hZ-R3E8_Hb_henHmYiKZkZVWN1T54w8fUFEbZhsfTnEI3tPeIRhvBhwZKhoDCljgitM0v_AALCA' alt='Israeli forces and residents in a West Bank area after recent clashes reported by multiple media outlets' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Settler population: More than half a million Israeli settlers live in West Bank settlements, which the articles note are considered illegal under international law.</li><li>Specific targets: Dozens of masked settlers attacked villages including Beit Lid and Deir Sharaf, setting vehicles and a Palestinian warehouse on fire and damaging Bedouin community property.</li><li>Accountability gap: Reporting highlights a accountability shortfall: sources say almost none of those behind settler attacks have been held to account by Israeli authorities.</li><li>Uncommon rebuke: Commentators and media described President Herzog&#x27;s public condemnation as a rare, forceful intervention compared with previously muted senior-level criticism.</li></ul><blockquote>We are aware of the recent violent incidents in which Israeli civilians attacked Palestinians and Israelis.
