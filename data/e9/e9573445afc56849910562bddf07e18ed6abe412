Developers can opt-in to the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta. <br/>

There's no word yet on what's included in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.6, but rumors suggest that Apple plans to bring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> to China. There have been some regulatory hurdles that Apple is dealing with, so &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; in China might be delayed beyond macOS 15.6.<br/>
