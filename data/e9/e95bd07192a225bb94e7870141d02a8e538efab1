Are you also tired of having to leave Emacs to read documentation? Whether be a simple command for your terminal (which you can run inside Emacs off course!), or information relating to the code you are working on? The good news it that you can read much of this documentation directly from inside of Emacs! No need to ever leave it again. By reading this post, I hope you will learn of a new way to get more of your information without ever leaving your favorite editor.
