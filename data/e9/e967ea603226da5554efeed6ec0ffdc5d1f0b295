<p>I read Timothy Snyder’s <em>On Tyranny</em> after the election. A collection of 20 essays — each relatively brief, some exceptionally brief — it’s more booklet than book, and can easily be consumed in an afternoon or a few evenings. I finished it with an unsettled feeling. I read it again last week, and my feeling now is both more unsettled and more resolute.</p>

<p>Snyder, a plain-speaking history professor at Yale, has a core message, <a href="https://snyder.substack.com/p/obeying-in-advance">which he’s been hammering</a> since <em>before</em> Trump’s re-election: <em>Do not obey in advance. Resist.</em> The following passage hit me harder on this second reading, two months into Trump 2.0, than it did in November. From Chapter 19: “Be a Patriot”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not patriotic to admire foreign dictators. It is not
patriotic to cultivate a relationship with Kim Jong Un; or to say
that Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin are superior leaders. It
is not patriotic to call upon foreign leaders to intervene in
American presidential elections. It is not patriotic to cite
Russian propaganda at rallies. It is not patriotic to share an
adviser with Russian oligarchs. It is not patriotic to appoint
advisers with financial interests in Russian companies. It is not
patriotic to appoint a National Security Advisor who likes to be
called “General Misha,” nor to pardon him for his crimes. It is
not patriotic when that pardoned official calls for martial law.
It is not patriotic to refer to American soldiers as “losers” and
“suckers.” It is not patriotic to take health care from families,
nor to golf your way through a national epidemic in which half a
million Americans die. It is not patriotic to try to sabotage an
American election, nor to claim victory after defeat. It is not
patriotic to try to end democracy.</p>

<p>A nationalist might do all these things, but a nationalist is not
a patriot. A nationalist encourages us to be our worst, and then
tells us that we are the best. A nationalist, “although endlessly
brooding on power, victory, defeat, revenge,” wrote Orwell, tends
to be “uninterested in what happens in the real world.”
Nationalism is relativist, since the only truth is the resentment
we feel when we contemplate others. As the novelist Danilo Kiš put
it, nationalism “has no universal values, aesthetic or ethical.”</p>

<p>A patriot, by contrast, wants the nation to live up to its ideals,
which means asking us to be our best selves. A patriot must be
concerned with the real world, which is the only place where his
country can be loved and sustained. A patriot has universal
values, standards by which he judges his nation, always wishing it
well — and wishing that it would do better.</p>

<p>Democracy failed in Europe in the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s, and it is
failing not only in much of Europe but in many parts of the world
today. It is that history and experience that reveals to us the
dark range of our possible futures. A nationalist will say that
“it can’t happen here,” which is the first step toward disaster. A
patriot says that it could happen here, but that we will stop it.</p>
