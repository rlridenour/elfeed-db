<li>Nonstick so stuff doesn’t stick to them (how’s that for a sales pitch?)</li>
<li>2 frying pans (8&quot; &amp; 10&quot;), 3 pots (5qt, 2.5qt &amp; 1.5qt), 3 lids</li>
<li>Dishwasher safe and oven safe up to 450 degrees</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but you can drink a margarita out of one in a pinch</li>
</ul><h1>Slides Right Off</h1><p>You know that friend you have who’s a little lost?</p>
<p>They always have some idea of what they’re going to do next, the thing that’s really gonna break the world wide open for them. They’re thinking maybe they should go back to school to become a vet. After all, they’ve always loved animals. Or, hey, there’s good money in wind turbine work. What about delivering the mail? You get paid to do cardio!</p>
<p>And throughout it all, the unspoken rule is you can’t point it out. Sure, their interests seem completely different than they were less than a month ago, but to be a good friend, you need to pretend you have no memory and say something like, “Wow, yeah, totally, I think that sounds great,” or else risk driving them further into despair.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with today’s project?</p>
<p>Well, we’re kinda like that friend of yours but with cookware.</p>
<p>One week, it’s: “We’re sorry, but stainless steel is simply the way to go! Once you learn how to use and take care of it, it cooks like a dream, and will last FOREVER! You can’t get <em>that</em> from nonstick pots and pans!”</p>
<p>The next week, it’s: “Bro, we’re telling you, these copper-looking pans (that have no actual copper in them) with a sort of waffle-patterned surface, they’re the <em>real deal</em>. Anything else SUCKS!”</p>
<p>And now: “Buddy, last time we checked, the food we cook is for <em>us</em>, not our pots and pans, amirite? That’s why you need something that’s <em>seriously</em> nonstick. None of this BS about how ‘YoU jUsT HavE tO lEArN hOw To UsE thEm.’ Pfft. You want a fried egg, you deserve a fried egg. No worrying about whether the pan got hot enough before you added the fat.”</p>
<p>A little chaotic, right?</p>
<p>So let’s reframe things.</p>
<p>It’s all about options. Some of you swear by stainless steel. Some of you swear by ceramic coating. Some of you prefer nonstick.</p>
<p>This sale is for those in the last category, the ones who see all the stainless steel stuff we offer and think, <em>I could use a new cookware set, but truth be told, I’m too set in my nonstick ways to change.</em></p>
<p>Also, this stuff is dishwasher safe. Which is nice. Nothing worse than when your largest, most annoying to maneuver kitchen stuff can’t go through the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Buy them if you want some nonstick pans.</p>
