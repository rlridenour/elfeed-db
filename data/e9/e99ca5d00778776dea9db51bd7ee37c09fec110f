<p>The U.N. Security Council on Monday adopted a U.S.-drafted resolution that endorses President Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza, authorizing an international stabilization force and creating a transitional &#x27;Board of Peace&#x27; to oversee governance and reconstruction. The resolution frames a conditional pathway toward future Palestinian statehood and gives the United States a central role in supervising the interim authority. Palestinian leaders in Ramallah welcomed the vote and called for its immediate implementation, while Hamas rejected the text as falling short of Palestinian political and humanitarian demands.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Q_fVwkRycUSg6thgSiBmenknN26EVFUmjJv_yYuMVftC0KpDC3Zm2fhA672CVGwWDiZIeuDUSdNbppOfWHePZhmV1pbp6I-_ABEVbTDLyUBUh1zWz9J4AtJsX0jKSeFPHd0RWxmJpj8X03hak9DZhP2TpW81e-NHXSwullkq2wjK-M5WJilkWgKrPDxGNFcI4DBQ3VYQCg' alt='Members of the United Nations Security Council during the vote on the U.S. Gaza plan on November 17, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>International stabilization force: The plan authorizes an International Stabilization Force (ISF) to help demilitarize Gaza, secure borders and train new Palestinian police, with operational cooperation noted with Israel and Egypt.</li><li>Transitional governance: The resolution creates a &#x27;Board of Peace&#x27; to oversee reconstruction and governance during a transitional period and envisions oversight arrangements led by President Trump.</li><li>Regional contributions uncertainty: Arab states signalled that U.N. authorization was necessary before they would consider contributing troops, leaving actual ISF membership and troop commitments unresolved.</li><li>Diverging reactions: Israel hailed the vote as a step toward security and reconstruction while Russia and China abstained and voiced procedural and substantive concerns about the plan&#x27;s details.</li></ul><blockquote>Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation, - Hamas (statement)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States / President Trump: The U.S. framed the resolution as a pathway to stabilize Gaza, endorse the Board of Peace, and support demilitarization while enabling reconstruction under international oversight.
