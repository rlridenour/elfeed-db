<p>A US government vaccine advisory panel has voted to end the long-standing recommendation that every newborn receive a hepatitis B shot within 24 hours of birth, keeping the birth-dose advice only for babies whose mothers have hepatitis B or whose status is unknown. For infants whose mothers test negative during pregnancy, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) now recommends that the first hepatitis B dose be given at the standard two‑month visit instead of in the delivery room. Supporters on the panel argued that widespread maternal screening means very few low‑risk newborns are exposed, and that aligning the shot with other routine infant vaccines may simplify schedules for parents and clinicians. Many liver and infectious‑disease specialists, however, warn that moving away from a universal birth dose could increase missed vaccinations and threaten decades of progress against a virus that can cause lifelong liver disease and cancer.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/CPoTzvlNbPt3auLcrD3qlH-gUEGTUx9dnn_TJppek1CAOykgmb88GK3mO2_um-OB6mnzcebzOx7jdLbd6eZSsx6YbSvFeheeOVysBKZan2h0BZfXRwTZyGh_6NK0-F6ioKjhiaxgyFjnkPO6D6UW0EQhLogmYuWXlxvfTpjGH0ejajhKY5x3WIkkc28ZKPGDz9IYmFOktnh3u7HptQxLC-guM2HkDFmKZPxm8jlqOgQcXnTt6BRri29Leh4CRPkf5VFHTZJW8F61oSOTp_oo' alt='A pediatric nurse prepares an infant vaccination in a US clinic as new hepatitis B guidance is debated.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Vote details: ACIP members approved the change by an 8–3 margin, after a debate that highlighted disagreements between the committee and several major medical societies that had urged retaining the universal birth‑dose policy.</li><li>High‑risk infants: Newborns whose mothers test positive for hepatitis B or whose infection status is not documented will still be advised to receive the vaccine in the first day of life under the updated recommendations.</li><li>RFK Jr. role: Health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. appointed the current slate of ACIP advisers, and several outlets report that the hepatitis B decision aligns with priorities long advocated by vaccine‑skeptical groups that have supported him politically.</li><li>Departure from precedent: The move marks one of several recent ACIP decisions that diverge from positions held by leading pediatric and infectious‑disease organizations, a shift observers say is unusual after more than thirty years of close alignment on vaccine schedules.</li><li>Implementation path: ACIP’s vote constitutes an advisory recommendation to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the CDC director must formally sign off before the change is incorporated into national immunization guidelines used by states and clinicians.</li></ul><blockquote>What is being implemented under the guise of “health freedom” is, in fact, the demolition of the very institutions and structures that have protected millions from infectious disease. - World Socialist Web Site editorial board</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>ACIP majority: Committee members who backed the change argued that universal maternal screening and follow‑up systems mean most low‑risk babies can safely receive their first dose at two months, and that the new schedule better reflects current epidemiology of hepatitis B in the US.
