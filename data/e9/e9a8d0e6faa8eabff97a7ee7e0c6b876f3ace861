separating lonely from solitude then reflecting on why I don&rsquo;t feel lonely writing.

The point of being here [in solitude] is not to get anything done; only to see
what might be worth doing.

<p>Spent a bit of time reading this morning and Tracy’s <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/08/22/re-do-blogs-need-to-be-so-lonely/">Re: do blogs need to be so
lonely?</a> rolled into my feed.  Tracy is responding to Jay’s <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/do-blogs-need-to-be-so-lonely/">Do blogs need to be
so lonely?</a>  And Tracy pulls this quote and then engages by sharing her
experience:</p>
<blockquote>
So why not collaborative blogging? Why not groups of people coming together to
create personal blogs? Something less formal than a journalist collective, but
more communal than a personal blog.  Blogging collectively opens us up to a new
kind of content, one in which members of the blog are in conversation with one
another in a way that’s comfortable and unique.
</blockquote>
<p>These posts spoke to me, with the hook being the word “lonely.”</p>
<p>Important in this is my distinction between loneliness and solitude.  Loneliness
for me is a feeling of isolation, in which I’m yearning for the presence of
others.  Whereas solitude is a deliberate retreat into myself; a place of
reflection, rejuvenation, and personal discovery.</p>
<p>With solitude and loneliness established, I look to Discord and Slack and other
“here’s where I can have online conversations.”  Due to their enclosed nature, I
don’t consider them “blogging.”  I view blogging as writing then publishing so
that it is available and shareable with others on the internet without
requirements of authorization nor authentication from the reader.</p>
<p>Further Discord and Slack overwhelm me.  For 40 hours a week I live in Slack.
And the thought of collaborative blogging reminds me of Slack and coordinating
group projects.  To which Tracy’s spot on, namely consider the “goals,
expectations, and vision upfront.”</p>
<p>Were I to find a group in which we worked those things out, I might make space
for collaborative blogging.  Yet even then, I’d be curious about the underlying
collaborative platform.  And wonder “Why isn’t it adequate for each person to
write their own posts on their own site in their own idiomatic way and aggregate
that into something.”  The aggregator could subscribe to each blog’s <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">Rich Site Summary</a></span> (<abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" title="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-RSS">&#128214;</a></small>)
 feed and re-post those blog posts.</p>
<p>Further, I don’t want my blogging to be beholden to obligations; that is “I need
to get my post in so as to unblock your post.”  Workflow orchestration amongst
people starts sounding very much like work.  And then enters the hobgoblin of
succession planning.</p>
<p>Instead, I look and think “we’re collectively failing on the possibility of
bi-directionality of links.”  Webmentions are one of those technologies.  And
for a few years, I was running a process that would receive pingbacks from
others referencing me as well as ping those I referenced.  But what I found was
that it was easy to get overrun with spam.  So instead, I dropped those, just as
I dropped comments.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> See <a href="doc-url">Comments on &ldquo;Comments on other blogs&rdquo;</a>.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>What this means is that folks who wish to comment can either: send me an email
or write their own response.  When they write their own response, there’s no
guarantee I’ll see it unless they then notify me.  Which works.  This keeps a
healthy relationship between the friction of things.<small class="side-container">

</small>
</p>
<p>But this all does not address the specter of loneliness.  I have taken to
writing emails to the authors of some of the posts I’ve read.  And have received
emails from other folks.  And from that we’ve engaged in conversation, which
invariably draw to a close.</p>
<p>I also think about the decades I’ve lived coordinating role-playing groups.  I’m
good at instigating and sustaining the initial effort, but I often run out of
energy trying to hold that together; unless we establish a ritual (e.g. we meet
every Monday).  Then I look at the energy to hold together the game for
everyone.  Which invariably I’ve failed at, in part because I hyper-fixate then
the interest fades.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> Maybe I should start an <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">Role Playing Game</a></span> (<abbr title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Role Playing Game”" title="Other site-wide references of “Role Playing Game”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-RPG">📖</a></small>)
campaign that is GM-less.  Or just run
adventures from modules and offer no transition from module to module.  Just
plunk, you stand before the dungeon doors.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>Which is to say, standing up a collaborative blogging effort seems like effort
to which I know my usual trajectory.  And in writing this post, I envision at
best that collaborative blogging would only have a miniscule chance of something
positive.  Further, relative to my current approach seems like it might turn my
hobby into something that feels like a job.</p>
<p>And I wonder if, as I write this, I’m also wrestling a bit with “Is there an
unspoken goal of this collaboration to strike it big?  Create something greater
than its parts that might lift my station in life?”</p>
<p>For all of this, I think I’d much rather spend my solitude time in writing and
reading and when feeling lonely, consider auditioning for a local summer
Shakespeare performance, or zine crafting fair at a local library, or take a
walk and chat with a neighbor.</p>
<p>Last, I don’t feel lonely writing.  I might turn to writing when I feel lonely,
but once I sit and commit to write, I feel as though I’m communing with myself
and those that might read this.  As Pico Iyer noted in <cite data-id="fee4ffa7-1d45-46e7-86f1-af203b92f54b">Aflame: Learning from Silence</cite>, he would go to Big Sur for solitude amongst a community of people also
seeking solitude.</p>
