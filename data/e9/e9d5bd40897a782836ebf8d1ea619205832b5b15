The fourth beta of iOS 26.1 includes an option to turn off the Lock Screen swipe that activates the camera, a feature that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users have been wanting for years.<br/>

In the Camera section of the Settings app, there's a Lock Screen Swipe to Open Camera setting, and turning it off disables the feature where you can swipe left to open the camera.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has long allowed users to open the Camera app directly from the Lock Screen with a swipe, but it can be a setting that's easy to activate, and it provides a way for someone that gets ahold of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to use it to take unwanted photos. <br/>

There was previously no way to turn off Lock Screen camera activation without disabling the camera app entirely. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/20/ios-26-1-lock-screen-camera-swipe-toggle/">iOS 26.1 Beta 4 Adds Toggle to Turn Off Lock Screen Camera Swipe</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-1-beta-4-adds-toggle-to-turn-off-lock-screen-camera-swipe.2469474/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
