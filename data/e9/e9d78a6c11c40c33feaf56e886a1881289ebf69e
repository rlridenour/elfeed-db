<p>A U.S. Navy F-35 fighter jet shot down an Iranian Shahed-139 drone after it “aggressively” approached the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln while the ship was operating in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday, U.S. Central Command said. U.S. officials said the drone kept heading toward the carrier despite “deescalatory measures,” and they described the shootdown as self-defense. The incident comes as Washington and Tehran still plan to hold nuclear talks in Oman on Friday, February 6, according to diplomats and regional officials, even as both sides trade warnings and show military strength. President Trump has warned of consequences if diplomacy fails. Iran’s president has called for “fair and equitable” negotiations, and Iran has tried to keep the agenda tightly focused on nuclear issues to lower the risk of a wider escalation. The downing is a reminder of how quickly a close encounter at sea can spiral. Still, several outlets pointed to a steadier through-line: both sides are still preparing to meet in Oman, keeping a channel open for de-escalation even amid tense maritime friction.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/dqIhCFdTAoiyGVXlkhJt4fJFju0mgwsjmTlI35_whI3msslaq-YZ3YIE4eHY6f-jNjEutBZJxIj4gb3oQOdtuUe-EaXfCeg306fsO9qI4kxqUynYYYm7-vMDjvh5Gp2XkAEln3bAGNsMfDfU8AGjkwMws_y_kuA7HKuvNDri177XTC5yLbzsFi7XVI9TuTT26jl2PgUaQCnTVESI' alt='F/A-18 fighter jets parked on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln in 2024.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Carrier deployment: The USS Abraham Lincoln headed to the Arabian Sea last month as part of a broader U.S. force buildup in the region.</li><li>Talks venue shift: A regional official said Tehran asked to move the planned meeting from Turkey to Oman and keep it limited to the nuclear programme, an effort to narrow the scope and reduce escalation risk.</li><li>Trump warnings (pressure context): President Trump’s “bad things” warning came alongside talk of possible military action and a widening standoff that has included mutual threats of air strikes.</li><li>Iran’s arsenal: NDTV highlighted the Shahed-139 as one piece of Iran’s broader drone inventory and capabilities.</li><li>Maritime friction: AllSides reported Iranian gunboats harassed a U.S.-flagged oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, but none of the other sources listed here corroborate that detail.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. Central Command: CENTCOM said the drone “aggressively approached” the carrier with “unclear intent” and continued toward the ship despite “deescalatory measures,” prompting a self-defense shootdown.
