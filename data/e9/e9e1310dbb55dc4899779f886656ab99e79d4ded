<h3 id="plain-text-productivity-changes">Plain text productivity changes</h3>
<p>2025 has seen some significant changes to my plain text (paper, less) productivity systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning on paper has moved from a regular planner/notebook to a <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/09/01/ptpl-171-edc-one-page-notebook" title="wikilink">One Page<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Notebook”</a> (<span class="small-caps">1P</span>)</li>
<li>The One Big Text File (<span class="small-caps">OBTF</span>) is now a <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/06/ptpl-176-simple-obsidian-iphone-shortcuts" title="wikilink">One Note Inbox (<span class="small-caps">1N</span>)</a></li>
<li>I’m managing tasks in the <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/27/ptpl-179-time-sectors-keep-tasks-relevant" title="wikilink">todo.txt format</a>, with nothing but saved searches: no specialised apps or <span class="small-caps">CLI</span> tools</li>
<li>My calendar home-base switched from Apple Calendar to <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/09/29/ptpl-175-calendar-txt-simplest-time-planning-system" title="wikilink">calendar.txt</a>, and from there to planner-md. More on this soon. Follow the hashtag #PlainTextPlanner on Mastodon to find out more, and join the conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s going so well! I’m in the process of writing it up to show exactly how all these elements work together to keep me calm and organised.</p>
<h3 id="meet-russ-the-clown-with-a-penchant-for-plain-text">Meet Russ, the clown with a penchant for plain text</h3>
<p>From 2018 to 2021, Scott Nesbitt published different people’s comments on their plain text lifestyle. Russ Sharek was one of those people. In the early 2000s he delved into technical areas like Linux, and Vim, and more recently into OpenBSD. I’ve so far stayed away from these, but the values that drive our systems are the same. <em>Note that there are no rights, no wrongs, and no shoulds when it comes to how technical you do or don’t get with plain text!</em></p>
<p>In 2020, Russ described himself as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a classically-trained theatrical clown, variety performer, circus artist, show runner, troupe director, and most recently teacher of human silliness as part of a physical theater residency program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is also a plain text enthusiast! I briefly connected with Russ on Mastodon a few weeks ago, where I learned about this virtual interview. Following are quotes from Russ’ piece on Scott’s (no longer maintained) site, and my take on them. Read the complete interview <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/articles/2020/04/07/Sharek.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="control-your-tools">Control your tools</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The notion that my tools could really be under my control was exciting, even if it meant burning everything to the ground a couple of times in the process of learning how it all worked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember what it felt like to taste the freedom of being tool agnostic for the first time! Exciting stuff indeed. Burning things to the ground was definitely part of my process, too. The plain text planner I created in 2022 felt like the pinnacle of success at the time, but it’s vastly different from where I am with my plain text planner today.</p>
<h3 id="give-in-to-the-obsession">Give in to the obsession</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve found the most effective way for an old dog like me to learn a new trick is to give over to my obsessive nature. If I really want to learn something, I have to take a deep breath and dive fully into the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely. There’s a fine but important line between prioritising working on the system over working in it, and giving a topic your full attention in order to truly understand it. Like Russ, I learn best when I live and breathe the thing I’m trying to solve / optimise / understand.</p>
<h3 id="turn-away-from-the-shiny">Turn away from the shiny</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The part of me that had previously found comfort in shiny, candy-like user interfaces seemed to suffer from something akin to trust issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Early on, I put my faith in a few software products that weren’t the most reliable because they seemed shiny and interesting. When they ultimately failed me, it took a lot of work to reconstruct everything I had given over to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So relatable! Recognising <a href="https://ellanew.com/2020/08/26/i-was-a-task-management-app-addict" title="wikilink">my propensity for following shiny objects</a> is what lead me to drop everything and embrace plain text in the first place. Sometimes the solution to avoiding shrapnel injuries from failed or obsolete software is to shift to plain text. Sometimes it’s the discipline to export your work into a portable, interoperable format like&nbsp;.txt,&nbsp;.md,&nbsp;.opml,&nbsp;.pdf.</p>
<p>Had I done that back in the day, I wouldn’t now be left with a pile of 30-year-old InDesign and Illustrator documents that can no longer (easily) be converted to anything readable. Fortunately there’s nothing vital in there.</p>
<h3 id="the-beauty-of-minimalistic-text">The beauty of minimalistic text</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>As a countermeasure to my easily-fascinated nature, I’ve learned to appreciate the beauty of efficiency and minimalism. Having a simple interface to my world is a bit of zen meditation for me, and it helps keep me focused on my creative goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>High five, Russ! The meditation aspect of plain text helps me to feel calm and centred, too. I like Obsidian’s source and live preview modes which let you switch from complexity to simplicity (and back again) with a keyboard shortcut.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-in-flexibility">Freedom in flexibility</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This goes back to why I love plain text in general. I can send the output of a file from one program to another and do all kinds of things never considered by their creators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that is the benefit of interoperability: even if you work with the bulk of your text in one preferred app, let it be in a format that’s accessible by many others. If you have to use a locked-in format, make the export-to-an-open-format habit a part of your life.</p>
