</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A brief recollection of a journey amongst the open sources.
</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, I switched my personal computering environment from MacOS to
Linux.  I first started with <span><a href="https://system76.com/pop/">Pop!_OS</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Pop!_OS”" title="Other site-wide references of “Pop!_OS”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-POP-OS">&#128214;</a></small>
 but in <time datetime="2025-09" title="2025-09">mid-September</time> I switched to <span><a href="http://debian.org/">Debian</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Debian”" title="Other site-wide references of “Debian”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-DEBIAN">&#128214;</a></small>
.
Part of the reason is reducing dependencies: <span>Pop!_OS</span>
 builds on <span><a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Ubuntu”" title="Other site-wide references of “Ubuntu”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-UBUNTU">&#128214;</a></small>
 which
builds on <span>Debian</span>
.  Another is to work within an <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">Operating System</a></span> (<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Operating System”" title="Other site-wide references of “Operating System”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-OS">&#128214;</a></small>)
 that supports a
broad base of computers.</p>
<p>I’m looking to be able to help others, if interested, move away from proprietary
<abbr title="Operating Systems">OSes</abbr>
.  Plus, I have a few old machines that are rather happy running <span>Debian</span>
.  As
I’ve long worked in MacOS, and continue to use one for my day job, I’d long used
<span><a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Homebrew”" title="Other site-wide references of “Homebrew”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-HOMEBREW">&#128214;</a></small>
.  Which I continued using in Pop!_OS and my initial <span>Debian</span>
 excursion.
Yet not all packages I wanted were in <span>Homebrew</span>
, so I mixed them with <span>Debian</span>

packages.</p>
<p>However, in building <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
 by hand, I encountered linking problems.  I ran an
experiment removing <span>Homebrew</span>
 from my path, and building what I needed.  That
worked well, so I kept doing it.</p>
<p>Now, I have a simpler Linux installation, using well-vetted packages, and things
work quite well.  I explored using <span><a href="https://xfce.org/">Xfce</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Xfce”" title="Other site-wide references of “Xfce”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-XFCE">&#128214;</a></small>
, but prefer the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">User Interface</a></span> (<abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “User Interface”" title="Other site-wide references of “User Interface”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-UI">&#128214;</a></small>)
/<span>User Experience</span> (<abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “User Experience”" title="Other site-wide references of “User Experience”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-USER-EXPERIENCE">&#128214;</a></small>)
 of Gnome.  I’m
going to give another try of Wayland, but I’m wanting to make sure that I map
<code>Hyper</code> to the bottom left <code>Control</code>.  I see <a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2024/04/28/the-simplest-thing-in-the-world-modifing-keymaps-in-wayland/">The Simplest Thing In The World:
Modifying Keymaps in Wayland</a> and I pause and wonder if I really want to
introduce that heartburn.<small class="side-container">

</small>
</p>
<p>I find myself writing more in my personal journal and less for a blog.  In part,
I’m doing more personal reflecting, but also recognizing that this is a season
in which I both have less to say and need to listen more.  Which means I’m also
reading a lot more; having completed 54 books this year.</p>
<p>I’m also feeling an itch to get back to some solo games, and know that winter is
a great time for building story.  So the blog rests but is not forgotten.</p>
