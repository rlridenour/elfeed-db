For this week's giveaway, we've <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/pages/rock-daily-planner?src=mrga">teamed up with Astropad</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro, and a Rock Paper Pencil kit to go along with it. Astropad has a range of useful hardware and software like the <a href="https://astropad.com/product/studio/">Studio</a>, <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/products/luna-display">Luna Display</a>, and <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/products/rock-paper-pencil">Rock Paper Pencil</a>, but the company just recently launched a new planning app, the <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/pages/rock-daily-planner?src=mrga">Rock Daily Planner</a>.<br/>

The Rock Daily Planner was built for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with full &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; integration, and it's clear that a lot of thought went into how people use planning apps on their tablets. The app has a clean design that minimizes distractions and puts maximum focus on events and tasks.<br/>

There's a side bar with a full calendar, but the most useful view is the daily interface. Each day gets a dedicated page, with an organized hourly timeline and a separate to-do list. A Daily Plan summarizes everything that you have going on.<br/>

The default view shows an hourly timeline and to-do list, but there are customization options for adding note-taking pages. You can create a page with dots, lines, a grid, or a to-do list, or opt for a blank page. You can import your calendar, so you can see your hour-by-hour schedule, important notes, and to-do list all in a single view.<br/>

The Rock Daily Planner is meant to be used with an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, so you can handwrite your calendar events, to-dos, and take notes. Notes can be customized with emoji labels, and can be pinned to the side bar so you can keep what's most needed front and center.<br/>

Rock Daily Planner was designed for Astropad's <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/collections/shop-astropad/products/rock-paper-pencil">&#36;45 Rock Paper Pencil</a>, and it's <a href="https://shop.astropad.com/pages/rock-daily-planner?src=mrga">free to download and use</a>. Rock Paper Pencil is a screen protector and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; tip kit that's designed to provide &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; users with a paper-like writing experience.<br/>

There's a microtexture screen protector that goes on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and it has a thin, papery feel. Since it's removable, you can put it on when you need it and then take it off later if you want to play a game. The screen protector is combined with a 1mm stainless steel &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; tip that feels like writing with a pencil when combined with the screen protector. If you dislike the feel of writing on smooth glass, the Rock Paper Pencil is a useful solution. There are options for most &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models.<br/>
