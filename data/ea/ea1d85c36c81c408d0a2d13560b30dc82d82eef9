Recently <a href="https://christiantietze.de/posts/2025/06/emacs-carnival-2025-06-take-two/">Christian Tietze called for Emacs blog posts</a> with the topic
"Take Two", meaning things that took two or more tries to get right.
He also said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Don’t have a blog, yet?
</p>

<p>
Well, just start one already! :)
</p>

<p>
It’s the future of the internet!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I mulled over this the whole month and finally decided to start a blog
about Emacs just in time to miss that first round of the Emacs
carnival! (I'm likely to miss deadlines like that again in the
future.)
</p>

<p>
Now, about twenty years ago, when blogs did actually seem like the
future of the internet, I had one on a hosted service. I think I may
have started on Blogspot, but then <a href="https://notandiario.wordpress.com/">moved to Wordpress.com</a>. It was a
personal blog about whatever random topic I wanted to write about. I
did not write very frequently on that blog, and am unlikely to write
often here either, although maybe constraining the topic to Emacs
might inspire me more than having no constraints did.
</p>

<p>
I was already an Emacs user back then, but I wasn't as gung-ho about
it as now, and back then I meekly accepted Wordpress making all sorts
of decisions for me, which seems cowardly today; so I definitely want
a more Emacsy way to write this new blog. I figure all a blog needs is
a publicly accessible web page and a publicly accessible RSS feed. An
important optional component is a system for comments. So, to do the
easiest thing possible, I will write my blog in a single Org file (for
now, I'll manually paginate if it turns out I do keep it up!), use
<a href="https://github.com/benedicthw/ox-rss">ox-rss</a> to create <a href="https://www.matem.unam.mx/~omar/apropos-emacs.xml">an RSS feed</a>, and for comments I'll just use Mastodon.
</p>

<p>
Since I threw this together in about ten minutes, I'm sure there will
be bugs. I probably don't have permalinks correct at all.
