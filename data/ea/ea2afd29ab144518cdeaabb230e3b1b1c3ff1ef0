<p>French prosecutors say police have arrested four additional suspects from the Paris region in connection with last month’s audacious daylight theft of imperial jewels from the Louvre Museum, bringing the total number of people detained to eight so far. The new detainees—two men aged 38 and 39 and two women aged 31 and 40—were taken into custody on Tuesday as part of an investigation led by the Paris prosecutor’s office into how a four-person gang used a truck, crane basket and angle grinders to access and remove historic French crown jewels in minutes. Investigators have linked three of the newly arrested individuals to the crime scene or related equipment through DNA traces, and earlier arrests included a couple identified after their genetic material was found in the basket lift used in the break‑in. Authorities say the thieves escaped on scooters with several high-value pieces, including a necklace once given by Napoleon I to Empress Marie‑Louise, while dropping a jewel‑encrusted crown during their getaway, and the stolen items—valued around $102 million or €88 million—remain missing as the probe continues.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/e_L3_KZTmCS69tkyBiA6uJp-lpbrDw-N9JRkMc8Y4WUvWP4aVrVToRQdqOVGP1BSdRiD6udcMRRxGrNa91hSbNNOD3FWCFguMEEjFVCjU7oz' alt='A broken Louvre Museum window, now boarded up, after thieves used a crane to smash their way into the Apollo Gallery in Paris.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>DNA evidence: Paris prosecutors report that genetic material from three of the four people newly detained was found either at the Louvre crime scene or on items linked to the heist, providing key forensic leads for investigators.</li><li>Suspects’ profiles: The latest group of suspects consists of two men and two women from the wider Paris area, all between their early thirties and around forty years old, adding to an already diverse set of alleged participants.</li><li>Earlier charged suspects: Among the four people previously charged is a 37‑year‑old man with 11 prior convictions, mostly for theft, and his partner, with whom he has children, both identified after DNA was recovered from the crane basket used in the break‑in.</li><li>Heist logistics: The gang used a moving truck equipped with a ladder and bucket lift to reach the Apollo Gallery window, then employed angle grinders to cut open glass display cases, completing the operation in only several minutes before escaping on scooters.</li><li>Cultural loss risk: The stolen collection includes multiple imperial jewels tied to Napoleon‑era France, and their ongoing absence poses a serious risk that historically significant pieces could be trafficked into private collections or altered for resale if not quickly recovered.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Paris prosecutor’s office: The prosecutor’s office has emphasized that the investigation remains active and that the newly arrested suspects are being questioned over their potential roles in planning or executing the theft of imperial jewels from the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery.
