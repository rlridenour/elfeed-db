Question When I do insert-char (C-x 8 RET) I get lots of &ldquo;no character&rdquo; font displays, as when I seek characters matching &ldquo;smil&rdquo;. Can I fix this without rebuilding emacs?
Answer Solved by following https://github.com/rolandwalker/unicode-fonts. Just put the .ttf files in my ~/.fonts dir, and where the repo links were broken I was able to download the font from google fonts. Didn&rsquo;t even have to restart my emacs.
