<p>US immigration authorities have frozen decisions on all asylum cases nationwide and paused issuing visas to Afghan passport holders after a shooting in central Washington, DC, in which two National Guard members were wounded and one later died, officials said on Friday. Joseph Edlow, director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, said his agency has stopped approving or denying asylum claims while it conducts a review of vetting procedures, explaining that the pause will remain until officials are satisfied screening is as thorough as possible. The moves came after President Trump announced that he would temporarily halt migration to the US from what he described as &quot;third-world countries,&quot; linking the policy shift to the suspect’s immigration background. Rights advocates and refugee organisations warned that a blanket suspension could strand vulnerable people in dangerous conditions abroad and create new legal challenges over US obligations to protect those fleeing persecution.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/vfRgbGCl5148EX4VqUrHR5UfZ4FDS3Lp9e6iAJ5lCJiSMO5JzzShwHDfXa1A1iRWQcvtcJ53Mxhhr2ph5mlQEdqFIhhE8nUXufWZVZ5H7CV1' alt='US National Guard soldiers secure a cordoned‑off area near the downtown Washington, DC, crime scene after the shooting.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Suspect identified: Officials identified the accused gunman as 29‑year‑old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who US media report previously served in CIA‑backed “Zero Units” in Afghanistan before entering the US in 2021.</li><li>Upgraded charges: Prosecutors in Washington, DC, have upgraded the case to first‑degree murder after specialist Sarah Beckstrom died from her injuries, and they say further charges are expected.</li><li>Victims’ conditions: Beckstrom, a 20‑year‑old West Virginia National Guard member deployed to the capital, died in hospital, while 24‑year‑old staff sergeant Andrew Wolfe remains in critical condition but is still alive, according to officials.</li><li>Additional deployments: Following the attack near the White House, President Trump ordered an extra 500 National Guard members to Washington, DC, as part of a broader public‑safety push in the city.</li><li>Death‑penalty pledge: US Attorney General Pam Bondi has said she will seek the death penalty for Lakanwal if he is convicted, calling the case a top priority for federal prosecutors.</li></ul><blockquote>It is a premeditated murder.
