<p>A federal court in El Paso on Tuesday struck down a Republican-drawn Texas congressional map, ruling it amounted to unlawful racial gerrymandering and cannot be used in the 2026 midterm elections. The map had been redrawn to try to convert five Democratic-leaning districts into likely Republican seats, a move that supporters said would protect the party&#x27;s slim U.S. House majority. The decision was hailed by civil rights groups that brought the challenge and will force Texas officials to seek appeals as the political stakes for the 2026 midterms rise.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/3otjhYvFO4rpgdpPjGB9phSq6aDeN2ij5uejb-_4YD-rFnpxIYOp6zLU9q-zhz0BkUyZ1qsfGqGc1rQVz2OrYuOvAqh6UWr1bCCAjz1yTMMws2Nm0nBA9SEJmm67AYwWjtiv1S1xYZfCjDe7BW67vRCOg1FvVJr_3RQ' alt='&#x27;Texas racially gerrymandered&#x27; map, US court rules' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Judges&#x27; finding: An El Paso three-judge panel found &quot;substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered&quot; the plan and criticised state actions that directed race-based redistricting</li><li>Procedural outcome: The panel ordered that congressional elections in 2026 be carried out under the previous map approved in 2021 rather than the new plan challenged in court</li><li>Seat math: Under the 2021 map, Republicans hold 25 of Texas&#x27;s 38 U.S. House seats, a baseline the new map had sought to alter by targeting five Democratic districts</li><li>Next steps: Governor Greg Abbott said Texas will appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, signalling the state intends to seek higher-court review before finalising 2026 plans</li></ul><blockquote>Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered - Three-judge panel</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Civil rights groups: They argued the new map diluted the voting power of racial minorities and successfully challenged it in federal court.
