<p>Though it isn’t the kind of thing one hears discussed every day, serious Disney fans do tend to know that Goofy’s original name was Dippy Dawg. But how many of the non-obsessive know that Mickey’s faithful pet Pluto was first called Rover? (We pass over in dignified silence the quasi-philosophical question of why the former dog is humanoid and the latter isn’t.) It is Rover, as distinct from Pluto, who passes into the public domain this new year, one of a cast of now-liberated characters including&nbsp;Blondie and Dagwood as well as Betty Boop — who, upon making her debut in&nbsp;Fleischer Studios’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL6aY_BXWUc"><em>Dizzy Dishes</em></a> of 1930, has a somewhat canoid appearance herself. You can see them all in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh9f_k7fQPA">the video above</a> from Duke University’s Center for the Study of the Public Domain, with much more information available in <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2026/">their blog post marking this year’s “Public Domain Day.”</a></p>
<p>The year 1930, write the Center’s Jennifer Jenkins and James Boyle, was one “of detectives, jazz, speakeasies, and iconic characters stepping onto the cultural stage — many of whom have been locked behind copyright for nearly a century.”</p>

<p>Novels that come available this year include William Faulkner’s <em>As I Lay Dying, </em>Dashiell Hammett’s <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, and Agatha Christie’s <em>The Murder at the Vicarage</em>; among the films are Lewis Milestone’s Best Picture-winning <em>All Quiet on the Western Front,</em> Victor Heerman’s Marx Brothers picture <em>Animal Crackers</em>, and&nbsp;Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí’s <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2012/06/two_vintage_films_by_salvador_dali_and_luis_bunuel.html"><em>L’Âge d’Or</em></a>. In music,&nbsp;compositions like “I Got Rhythm” and “Embraceable You” by the Gershwin Brothers as well as recordings like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzaWFfyh1N4">“Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen”</a> by Marian Anderson and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAExrFCVVT0">“Sweet Georgia Brown”</a> by Ben Bernie and His Hotel Roosevelt Orchestra have also, at long last, gone public.</p>
<p>Reflection on some of these works themselves suggests something about the importance of the public domain. With the title of <em>Cakes and Ale</em>, another book in this year’s crop, Somerset Maugham makes reference to “a classic public domain work, in this case Shakespeare’s <em>Twelfth Night</em>”; so, for that matter, does Faulkner, given that the line “as I lay dying” comes from the <em>Odyssey</em>.&nbsp;“To tell new stories, we draw from older ones,” write Jenkins and Boyle. “One work of art inspires another — that is how the public domain feeds creativity.” Today, we’re free to take explicit inspiration for our own work from <em>Nancy Drew</em>, “Just a Gigolo,” <em>Blondie</em>, Mondrian’s <em>Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow</em>, Hitchcock’s&nbsp;<em>Murder!</em>, and much else besides. And by all means use Rover, but if you also want to bring in Dippy Dawg, you’re going to have to wait until 2028.</p>
