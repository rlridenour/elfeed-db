<p>President Trump announced late on 24 October 2025 that the United States has “terminated” all trade negotiations with Canada after an Ontario government television advertisement used excerpts of a 1987 Ronald Reagan address to criticize tariffs, which the President and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation said misrepresented Reagan’s remarks . The move comes amid an ongoing dispute since earlier in 2025 over U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminium and autos and reciprocal measures from Ottawa, and it raises immediate uncertainty for industry talks that had been under way between the two countries . Officials in Canada — including Premier Doug Ford and Prime Minister Mark Carney — and the Reagan Foundation have issued responses, with the foundation saying it is reviewing legal options over the ad’s use of edited material .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8Z5kr3jWVMn82HTJ6IzYG8DgBaD3Egi0VJFdVotscbaNxXuDJzDk8ZylpnZRAFTn1NO8HsaZvJnP8LCVUxYfh2a3mChSC4ZWBaseVzsHuETL' alt='President Donald Trump meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney (not pictured) in the Oval Office, October 7, 2025 — image used in reporting on the bilateral talks' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ad spending: Ontario’s ad campaign is reportedly large-scale, with one report saying it cost about C$75m and will run through January on multiple U.S. networks, a campaign Ottawa says quoted a public-domain Reagan address .</li><li>Tariff background: U.S. duties on Canadian steel, aluminum and autos imposed earlier in 2025 prompted retaliatory measures from Ottawa and broader trade tensions between the neighbours .</li><li>Legal questions: The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation said the ad “misrepresents” Reagan’s 1987 remarks and is reviewing legal options, raising a potential copyright and editing dispute .</li><li>Policy timing: Officials and reporting note the U.S. Supreme Court is due to hear arguments related to the tariffs on 5 November, a timeline the White House tied to its concerns about the ad’s intent .</li></ul><blockquote>Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED. - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump / White House: The president said the Ontario advertisement &#x27;fraudulently used&#x27; edited Reagan audio and described Canada’s behaviour as &#x27;egregious,&#x27; announcing termination of all trade negotiations on social media.
