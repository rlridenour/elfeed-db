<p>Yesterday President Trump threatened via social media to stop &#8220;all federal funding&#8221; for &#8220;any College, School, or University that allows &#8220;illegal protests&#8221;.<span id="more-52973"></span></p>

<p>I think the first question to ask in regard to things like this is, &#8220;what is this meant to divert our attention from?&#8221; After all, it&#8217;s a social media post, not an executive order he&#8217;s issuing or a piece of legislation he&#8217;s supporting.</p>
<p>About the content of the post, well, everything hinges on what makes a protest &#8220;illegal&#8221;. <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-federal-funding-will-stop-colleges-schools-allowing-illegal-protests-2025-03-04/">reported</a>: &#8220;A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to questions about how the White House would define an illegal protest or how the government would imprison protesters.&#8221; Reuters also drily noted, &#8220;The U.S. Constitution&#8217;s First Amendment protects the freedom of speech and assembly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) issued a <a href="https://www.thefire.org/news/statement-president-trumps-truth-social-post-threatening-funding-cuts-illegal-protests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> in response to Trump&#8217;s threat. It says, in part:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Colleges can and should respond to unlawful conduct, but the president does not have unilateral authority to revoke federal funds, even for colleges that allow “illegal” protests. </em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>If a college runs afoul of anti-discrimination laws like Title VI or Title IX, the government may ultimately deny the institution federal funding by taking it to federal court, or via notice to Congress and an administrative hearing. It is not simply a discretionary decision that the president can make.  </em></p>
<p><em>President Trump also lacks the authority to expel individual students, who are entitled to due process on public college campuses and, almost universally, on private campuses as well.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Today’s message will cast an impermissible chill on student protests about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Paired with <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-combating-anti-semitism/">President Trump’s 2019 executive order </a>adopting an unconstitutional definition of anti-Semitism, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/">his January order</a> threatening to deport international students for engaging in protected expression, students will rationally fear punishment for wholly protected political speech.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As FIRE knows too well from our work defending student and faculty rights under the Obama and Biden administrations, threatening schools with the loss of federal funding will result in a crackdown on lawful speech. Schools will censor first and ask questions later&#8230; </em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Misconduct or criminality — like true threats, vandalism, or discriminatory harassment, properly defined — is not protected by the First Amendment. In fact, discouraging and punishing such behavior is often vital to ensuring that others are able to peacefully make their voices heard. </em><em>However, students who engage in misconduct must still receive due process. </em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, as the <em>New York Times </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/nyregion/trump-columbia-antisemitism.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>, &#8220;The Trump administration is threatening to cut tens of millions of dollars in federal funding for Columbia University, making the school the first major target in its effort to root out what it considers <a class="css-yywogo" title="" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-formation-task-force-combat-anti-semitism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antisemitic harassment</a> on college campuses.&#8221; Columbia is one of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-task-force-combat-antisemitism-announces-visits-10-college-campuses-experienced" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ten universities explicitly named</a> as targets of investigation by the Federal Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/03/05/trumps-threat-to-universities-about-illegal-protests/">Trump’s Threat to Universities about “Illegal Protests”</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
