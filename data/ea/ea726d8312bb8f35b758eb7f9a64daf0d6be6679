<blockquote>
  <p>If Microsoft owns 27 percent of OpenAI, it stands to reason under
equity accounting that it bears 27 percent of OpenAI’s losses.
Microsoft’s admission that it shaved $3.1 billion off its net
income to account for its share of OpenAI losses therefore
suggests OpenAI lost about $11.5 billion during the quarter.
Microsoft declined to comment beyond confirming that the $3.1
billion loss “this year” referred to Microsoft’s current fiscal
year, which started July 1, not the calendar year. So that’s a
quarterly loss, not a nine-month loss.</p>

<p>That’s a humongous number for OpenAI given it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-first-half-revenue-rises-16-about-43-billion-information-reports-2025-09-30/">reportedly</a>
generated only $4.3 billion in revenue for the first half of the
year, but a sum that won’t hurt Big Daddy Redmond too much given
it earned $27.7 billion in net income in the last quarter alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A pre-IPO startup is a different animal from an established publicly-held corporation, but an $11.5 billion quarterly loss is quite different from the $20–30-ish billion quarterly profits <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/30/apple-q4-results">booked by the big six</a>.</p>
