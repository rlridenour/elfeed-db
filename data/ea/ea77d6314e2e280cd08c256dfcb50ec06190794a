<p>George Washington&#8217;s teenage journal contains <a href="https://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/washingtons-youth/washington-the-love-poet">this love acrostic</a>:</p>
<p>From your bright sparkling Eyes, I was undone;<br />
Rays, you have, more transparent than the sun,<br />
Amidst its glory in the rising Day,<br />
None can you equal in your bright arrays;<br />
Constant in your calm and unspotted Mind;<br />
Equal to all, but will to none Prove kind,<br />
So knowing, seldom one so Young, you&#8217;l Find.<br />
Ah! woe&#8217;s me, that I should Love and conceal,<br />
Long have I wish&#8217;d, but never dare reveal,<br />
Even though severely Loves Pains I feel;<br />
Xerxes that great, was&#8217;t free from Cupids Dart,<br />
And all the greatest Heroes, felt the smart.</p>
<p>Reading the first letter of each line spells FRANCES ALEXA. Who was this? Possibly the subject&#8217;s full name was Frances Alexander and Washington hadn&#8217;t finished the poem.</p>
