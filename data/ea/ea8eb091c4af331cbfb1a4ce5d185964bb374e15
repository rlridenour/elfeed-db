EDIT: I now recommend use of the excellent Disqus forum instead of built-in Drupal. It automates and crowd-sources spam control, and has a host of other features.
As this frustrated user put it,
 I want Drupal comments to work like every other blog&rsquo;s comments. Who are writing their homepage URL can write &ldquo;www.example.com,&rdquo; or &ldquo;https://www.example.com,&rdquo; and they both work. Right now, Drupal throws an error if the URL doesn&rsquo;t contain &ldquo;https://.
