</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Looking at recently arrived books and feeling a sense of exploration and desire to play.
</p>
        <p>Back in high school, when I didn’t access to such ubiquitous personal electronic
computing, one of my time sinks was rolling up AD&amp;D 2nd Edition characters.  To
this day, I can look at three six-sided pipped dice and immediately know the
sum.  I can also do so with 4d6, dropping the lowest roll.</p>
<p>This past week, I received <a href="https://necroticgnome.com/products/welcome-to-dolmenwood">Dolmenwood</a> source books.  And I felt the call to roll
up a character.  There are online character generators for this game, but I have
felt that these cheapen the character generation experience.</p>
<p>There’s something about engaging with the tables in an open book that gets me
thinking.  Perhaps it is rolling on a table for names or features and seeing
other possibilities; that is absorbing just a bit more of the world lore.  It is
why I love <cite><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/194344/Apocalypse-World-2nd-Ed?affiliate_id=318171">Apocalypse World</a></cite> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Apocalypse World”" title="Other site-wide references of “Apocalypse World”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-AW">&#128214;</a></small>
 playbooks—the custom moves and abilities create a
flavor of where this game might go.  But it is not the only flavor, as game play
also creates the melange that is the experience.</p>
<p>One thing I have wondered about Dolmenwood is if the rules are a suitable
representation of the campaign world?  For it is the campaign world that I find
intriguing.  I know that the chassis of the game is robust; but is Faerie
something that can be suitably modeled in the system.  Does it matter?  Because
the rules are but one aspect of the experience and overall enjoyment.</p>
<p>The published adventures are another facet.  And reading through
<cite>Winter’s Daughter</cite>, the ambiance and encounters track toward Faerie.
And being of a particular rules set, it means many many adventures are readily
available for dropping into the game.</p>
<p>I do miss playing table-top role-playing games.  I’ve tried the online play, but
having known the other options, I much prefer face to face.  At this point given
the option of playing online or not playing, it is clear that I’d rather not
play.  As I live in a very rural corner of Southwest Michigan, the preference
for face to face is a barrier.</p>
<p>Which has me considering solo-play.  At present, I’m finding lots of enjoyment
in reading.  Both my partner and I are participating in a reading challenge; and
we’re finding common literary interests, which is an unexpected and pleasant
surprise for this challenge.  Which means that I think—again at present—that I’m
more interested in reading a book that both she and I might like versus playing
a game.</p>
<p>Which, if Dolmenwood is helping nudge me towards play, I’ll take that as a net
positive.</p>
