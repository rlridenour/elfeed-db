<li>Simultaneous 65W+65W charging</li>
<li>Or 140W max on a single port</li>
<li>6-foot 140W USB-C cable included with each one</li>
<li>Works for phones, laptops, whatever</li>
<li>GaN means they charge efficiently, and they charge fast</li>
<li>You can’t have too many of these things, really</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: We wouldn’t be surprised if blenders started plugging into USB-C soon (if they haven’t already)</li>
</ul><h1>Charge It</h1><p><em><strong>PRODUCT COMPARISON: Einova Polaris Dual-Port 140W USB-C Charger vs. Buzzed Power Dispenser 5.0</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Einova Polaris Dual-Port 140W USB-C Charger</strong></p>
<p><em>Pros:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>2 USB-C ports on each charger</li>
<li>Charges at 65W in both ports at the same time, or 140W if you just use one port</li>
<li>Can charge phones, laptops, you name it</li>
<li>GaN (gallium nitride) transistors allow for efficient energy transfer, resulting in faster charging</li>
<li>Non-addictive for devices</li>
<li>Available in a 2-pack</li>
<li>Easy to take with you</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cons:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Only provides devices with one flavor (unsweetened electricity)</li>
<li>Only works with USB-C-ended cables</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Buzzed Power Dispenser 5.0</strong></p>
<p><em>Pros:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Pours delicious electricity into devices, regardless of port</li>
<li>Three year-round flavors of electricity: lemon-lime, cotton candy, and blue razzmatazz</li>
<li>Seasonal flavors released regularly (a little pumpkin spice power, anyone?)</li>
<li>Has what devices crave</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cons:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Can dehydrate and overstimulate devices</li>
<li>Flavor-syrup refills sold separately</li>
<li>Will keep pouring electricity into devices well after they’ve had their fill</li>
<li>Devices can become addicted to sweet electricity and grow despondent, belligerent, and/or shaky if you try to give them unsweetened electricity</li>
<li>Even if you stop buying the flavor-syrup refills in an effort to detox your devices, you may wake up and find your phone has pawned your smart watch to buy more</li>
<li>On that last point: the more we think about it, the worse it is; that’s not like you pawning a watch, it’s like you pawning a SIBLING</li>
<li>Syrup bottles are non-recyclable</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Verdict: Though your devices may ask for the Buzzed Power Dispenser 5.0, the Einova Polaris Dual-Port 140W USB-C Charger is the safer bet.</p>
