<p>About 153 Palestinians from the Gaza Strip arrived in Johannesburg on a charter flight this week and were held on the tarmac after authorities found they lacked proper travel documents; South Africa later allowed 130 to enter on short-stay terms while 23 took onward flights. President Cyril Ramaphosa said the group appeared to have been &quot;flushed out&quot; of Gaza and ordered an investigation into who organised the transfer. Palestinian officials say families were deceived by an unregistered organiser, while Israeli sources and some evacuees say Israel helped facilitate the transfers and that visas had been issued in advance.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wUuXTkKUobFl6doRrZTa11lOxSXJER11ZUQCRaQkjno8KK2XM8TZW1i9u2TDJAH2M6JVl8xNGOG5Z3WUt9YUPN3isq8GNdlz5N4KkNc7VCll' alt='Hanan Jarrar, Palestinian ambassador to South Africa, smiles for a picture on a plane in a location given as Johannesburg, South Africa, in this handout image released on Nov 13, 2025. — Embassy of the State of Palestine/South Africa Facebook via Reuters' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tarmac delay: Border police kept the passengers aboard the charter for about 12 hours because many lacked Israeli departure stamps, prompting the initial refusal to disembark</li><li>Charity support: The South African charity Gift of the Givers guaranteed accommodation that allowed authorities to permit the group to land and be taken into care</li><li>Earlier arrival: A previous flight carrying 176 Palestinians landed in Johannesburg on October 28, some of whom later travelled on to other destinations, indicating this is not an isolated transfer</li><li>Who&#x27;s investigating: South African intelligence services and home affairs officials have opened inquiries into who arranged the chartered flights and whether an unregistered organisation was involved</li><li>International context: Meanwhile the United States urged the UN Security Council to support President Trump&#x27;s Gaza peace plan, a diplomatic development running alongside the arrivals</li></ul><blockquote>It does seem like they were being flushed out, - President Cyril Ramaphosa</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>South African president (Cyril Ramaphosa): The arrivals &quot;appear to have been &#x27;flushed out&#x27; of Gaza,&quot; and South Africa will investigate the details while admitting people &quot;out of compassion&quot;.
