Apple CEO Tim Cook today said that a more personalized version of Siri remains on track to launch at some point next year, with the new set of features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/">expected to debut on the iPhone as part of iOS 26.4</a> in March or April.<br/>

"We're also excited for a more personalized Siri," said Cook, on Apple's earnings call for the third quarter of the 2025 calendar year. "We're making good progress on it, and as we've shared, we expect to release it next year."<br/>
<br/>
Apple first announced the personalized Siri features during its WWDC 2024 keynote, but in March it announced that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">they were delayed</a>. The new capabilities will include better understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. For example, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.<br/>

Apple is facing multiple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/apple-intelligence-siri-lawsuit/">class action lawsuits</a> over the delayed features.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/30/tim-cook-say-siri-revamp-on-track-for-next-year/">Apple CEO Tim Cook Says Revamped Siri on Track to Launch Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-says-revamped-siri-on-track-to-launch-next-year.2470153/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
