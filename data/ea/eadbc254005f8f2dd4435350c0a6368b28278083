<p>Madagascar’s military announced it had taken power on Tuesday after lawmakers voted to impeach President Andry Rajoelina, with Colonel Michael Randrianirina saying a military council would govern alongside a transitional civilian administration and organize elections within two years [reuters.com#1][france24.com#3][bbc.com#1]. The army said it dissolved most state institutions except the lower house of Parliament, while Rajoelina’s whereabouts remained unclear after he fled or moved to a “safe place,” and he has insisted he is still in charge [france24.com#3][allafrica.com#1][bbc.com#1]. The takeover follows nearly three weeks of mass, youth-led protests over water and power shortages and broader grievances; crowds in the capital cheered the army at times, and at least 22 people were killed during the unrest [lemonde.fr#1][npr.org#1][bbc.com#2][washingtonpost.com#1]. Parliament’s impeachment vote came after Rajoelina issued a decree attempting to dissolve the National Assembly, which lawmakers refused to accept [apnews.com#2][reuters.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/mRT5TDb4VLFp2ZrXvXsygGMM0lqw2qWrklxV8csRoVKVcLDE_D7686SEibw7kp0CbGL0AfhhEgQ6Sc-r2BonHlMNMEC2ijpXxPv8cnJolw6u7awIQvzrMkWvwhNmpvymeG30ZIU9RIZidKSG5gBl6pT4X4l-NIXnbt28NTO8ZiCsWGo61DV5E1lrfC96STU2UeUY5Pih31h7rbpBg8KiZ47dTpmxUizCKXFORlPp0W0dSrAV0M1bkbU0N7fNHEGuLfXNtN2RArOgmJIdrQ' alt='CAPSAT commander Col.
