<p>I have my local vim set up to integrate with my system clipboard (so that <code>p</code>
pastes from my system clipboard etc), but I thought it was impossible to do the
same thing over SSH. It turns out that actually it is possible with an ANSI
escape sequence called OSC52! A few links:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a core Neovim feature: the <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/provider.html#clipboard-osc52">neovim OSC 52 docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fcpg/vim-osc52">a vim-osc52 plugin</a></li>
<li>a <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/14995">vim github issue about adding OSC 52 support</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried this yet but it seems very cool</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cyberdemon.org/">Dmitry Mazin</a> also told me you can create this
script on a remote host, call it <code>pbcopy</code>, and piping into it will copy to your
clipboard! I tested it and it works.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
printf &quot;\033]52;c;%s\007&quot; &quot;$(base64 | tr -d '\n')&quot;
</code></pre>
