Below, we've collated an updated set of key details that have been leaked about Apple's foldable iPhone so far.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Overall Design</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Book-Style</span><br><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-23/apple-aapl-explores-turning-watches-into-wearable-ai-devices-with-cameras-m8ll6mvy"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple's foldable iPhone is similar in style to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold, which uses a book-style folding mechanism, rather than the clamshell design of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">Industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> expects the foldable ‌iPhone‌ to measure between 9 and 9.5 mm when folded, and around 4.5 to 4.8 mm when unfolded. More recently, Weibo-based leaker Instant Digital has said that the foldable iPhone will have a thickness of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/foldable-iphone-thickness-and-price-rumors/">at least 4.8mm</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Display Sizes</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Dual Screens</span><br><br/>
When folded, users will interact with a 5.5-inch outer display that is similar to a typical iPhone screen, while unfolding it will reveal a larger 7.8-inch iPad-style screen. The inner display is said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/25/apple-2026-foldable-phone-has-no-crease/">virtually crease-free</a>, thanks to Apple's use of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/foldable-iphone-crease-free-samsung-display/">metal plate</a> that can disperse and control the stress generated by bending the display. These dimensions have been corroborated by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/">two</a> reputable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/">sources</a>. According to one rumor, the inner folding display will have a 4:3 aspect ratio and use a 2,713 x 1,920 resolution, while the outer display will use a 2,088 x 1,422 resolution.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Chassis and Hinge</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Durable Materials</span><br><br/>
The foldable iPhone reportedly has a titanium chassis, with the hinge constructed from a combination of titanium and stainless steel, <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">according to Kuo</a>. Apple is said to be using liquid metal in the hinges to improve durability and help eliminate screen creasing. Liquid metal, manufactured using a die-casting process, has been chosen by Apple to address these two common issues with foldable devices, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/apple-liquid-metal-foldable-iphone-hinges/">according to the analyst</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Cameras</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Front and Rear</span><br><br/>
The foldable iPhone is expected to include a dual-lens rear camera, with a front-facing camera for both folded and unfolded states, <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">according to Kuo</a>. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/foldable-iphone-rumored-features/">corroborated</a> reports that the device will have four cameras consisting of one front camera, one inner camera, and two rear cameras. Prolific Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station claims that the rear dual lenses will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/26/foldable-iphone-dual-rear-camera-rumor/">48 megapixels each</a>. Other sources have claimed that the inner display features an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/">under-screen camera (USC)</a>, while the outer display – in the device's folded state – will have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/iphone-fold-camera-setup-outer-display/">punch-hole camera</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Authentication</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Touch ID</span><br><br/>
Kuo believes the phone will <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">forgo Face ID authentication</a>, and instead use a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-24/apple-to-launch-iphone-17-pro-iphone-17-air-in-september-iphone-fold-next-year-mepmzpcj">corroborated</a> the rumor. Apple has previously integrated Touch ID into the side button of the iPad, iPad Air, and iPad mini.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Cellular Connectivity</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">C1 Modem</span><br><br/>
The foldable iPhone will use Apple's second-generation C2 modem for cellular connectivity, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/foldable-iphone-rumored-features/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Apple debuted its custom-designed C1 modem in the iPhone 16e earlier this year, as part of a multi-year plan to transition away from Qualcomm modems. Gurman says the foldable device will not have a physical SIM slot.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Battery Life</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">High-Density Cells</span><br><br/>
Apple is putting a heavy focus on improving power efficiency by slimming down key components like the display driver to make room for more battery cells, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/foldable-iphone-impressive-battery-life-thinness/">Korean blog</a> that has leaked accurate details about unreleased products before. The phone will reportedly use <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">high-density battery cells</a> – the same ones that Kuo believes will be used in Apple's upcoming ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air. Expect the C2 modem to be faster overall, and for it to gain mmWave support in the United States. Further power efficiency improvements are likely too.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Color Options</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Black and White</span><br><br/>
Apple is currently only testing variations of black and white for the folding phone with suppliers, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-24/apple-to-launch-iphone-17-pro-iphone-17-air-in-september-iphone-fold-next-year-mepmzpcj"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, although he says that Apple's plans could evolve before the device launches.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Pricing</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Premium Segment</span><br><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/foldable-iphone-price-estimate/">Multiple</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/">reports</a> suggest the foldable iPhone will be priced between &#36;2,000 and &#36;2,500 in the United States, which could make it the most expensive iPhone ever. More recently, analysts at investment banking firm UBS believe the phone will be between <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/16/foldable-iphone-thickness-and-price-rumors/">&#36;1,800 and &#36;2,000</a>. Regardless of the price, the foldable is expected to tap into Apple's loyal fanbase, some of whom will view it as a "must-have device" if its quality meets expectations.<br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Launch Date</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Late 2026</span><br><br/>
According to industry analyst Jeff Pu, the device entered the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/">New Product Introduction (NPI) phase</a> at Foxconn in March. Foxconn is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/18/foldable-iphone-manufacturing-2025-start/">expected</a> to officially start producing Apple's foldable iPhone late in the third quarter of 2025 (late September), or early in the fourth quarter (October). An exact launch date is currently unknown, but both Kuo and Pu say mass production is planned for the second half of 2026. <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman has said he expects the device to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/">launched next year</a> in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-24/apple-to-launch-iphone-17-pro-iphone-17-air-in-september-iphone-fold-next-year-mepmzpcj">fall season</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/25/2026-foldable-iphone-leak-roundup/">2026 Foldable iPhone: All the Leaks So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2026-foldable-iphone-all-the-leaks-so-far.2461696/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
