<p>Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine was taken from his home in Kampala in what his party said involved an army helicopter, after a tense national election held amid a nationwide internet blackout. As provisional results were released, Uganda’s Electoral Commission figures reported President Yoweri Museveni holding a large lead with more than half of polling stations reporting, while Wine and his party alleged irregularities and restrictions on their activities. Police spokespeople were quoted as saying they were not aware of Wine being under house arrest, a claim repeatedly made by his party as security surrounded his residence. The competing accounts, alongside reports of election-day violence, have raised concerns about political freedoms and the integrity of the process even as many Ugandans hoped the vote would offer a peaceful way to shape their country’s future.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SzhU4CGIoUApCCOLIzDu--ORSx-R60V3UcZ0jNMi0UJMoDuaxoJfyjHVOMbiJZSK7i-xgD01Wl5nMJkExFrtELiRKSGyYCTwDsBQIGJrUVo5cu8nctUsMPqSD6Ota8kBjfj_aFJyMDvWikUvndTxAQWSOjXTBf8On-wyxl-M-UzN4TpXnc7PLXZUyN_B6-6xtcsA3UbsTs8' alt='Supporters of the opposition leader Bobi Wine in Kampala, Uganda, on Monday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Vote snapshot: With close to 60% counted, the Electoral Commission tally cited by SCMP put Museveni at 75.4% and Wine at 20.7%.</li><li>Observers present: Uganda accredited more than 1,600 international and regional observers, including delegations from the African Union, East African Community, EU, US, UK, China and others.</li><li>Observer praise: A Russian observer delegation said it saw orderly queues, identification checks, and ballot designs intended to help non-literate voters, and reported no serious violations affecting results.</li><li>Violence claims: A senior opposition figure told AFP that security forces shot dead 10 campaign team members inside his home on polling day, an allegation also echoed in other reports of election-related violence.</li><li>Rigging allegations: Wine alleged “massive ballot stuffing” and said opposition polling agents and supervisors were abducted, while warning he could call protests if the vote was “rigged”.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>National Unity Platform (Bobi Wine’s party): The party said Wine was forcibly taken away after an army helicopter landed at his compound, and separately described him as effectively confined at home by surrounding security forces.
