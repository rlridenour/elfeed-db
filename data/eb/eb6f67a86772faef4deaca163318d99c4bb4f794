<p>OK not quite, but having recently learned about <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Appending-Kills.html">C-M-w (append-next-kill)</a>, I used it in a keyboard macro to fish out matching lines. This is similar to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Repeating-Search.html">flush-lines</a>, except the kill ring is also populated. This is handy, if you need the flushed lines. Here's an example.</p>

<p>Here's the equivalent in Emacs lisp:</p>
<pre><code class="language-{.commonlisp">(defun flush-kill-lines (regex)
  &quot;Flush lines matching REGEX and append to kill ring.  Restrict to \
region if active.&quot;
  (interactive &quot;sFlush kill regex: &quot;)
  (save-excursion
    (save-restriction
      (when (use-region-p)
        (narrow-to-region (point) (mark))
        (goto-char 0))
      (while (search-forward-regexp regex nil t)
        (move-beginning-of-line nil)
        (kill-whole-line)))))
</code></pre>
