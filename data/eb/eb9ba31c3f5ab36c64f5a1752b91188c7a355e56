<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds-bounce/id6462195757">Angry Birds Bounce</a> is a new take on the iconic Angry Birds game, which has been downloaded billions of times over the years. According to Apple, it combines classic Angry Birds slingshot gameplay with arcade-style brick-breaker mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's full description of the game:<blockquote>Join Red, Chuck, Bomb, and the rest of the gang on a brand-new adventure. Angry Birds Bounce combines the classic charm of Angry Birds with an innovative arcade brick-breaker twist. When the pigs take over their islands, the birds must bounce back — literally — combining into powerful flocks and launching themselves to defeat an army of piggies and reclaim their home. With strategic rogue-lite gameplay, each level is a new challenge where players will master precision shots, unlock exciting power-ups, and build unique combos during each run.</blockquote>All four games that are coming to Apple Arcade on July 3:<ul><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds-bounce/id6462195757">Angry Birds Bounce</a></li><br/>
