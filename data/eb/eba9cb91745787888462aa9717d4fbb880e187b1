<p>Hey,</p>
<h2 id="the-project-link">The project link</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/KryDos/laradock-helper">https://github.com/KryDos/laradock-helper</a> is the project repo.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>Since recently I work mostly with Laravel and run it with <a href="http://laradock.io/">Laradock</a>
I&rsquo;ve came up with some Makefile targets I use constantly instead of running some commands manually.</p>
<p>Like an example are migration or seed commands, or commands to join php container I can call just
<code>make run-migrations</code> or <code>make join-php</code> which is faster.</p>
<p>Hope it can be useful for someone else too.</p>
