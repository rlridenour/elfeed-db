Launched in 2022, the Self Service Repair program provides customers with <a href="https://selfservicerepair.com/en-CA/order">access to genuine Apple parts</a>, <a href="https://selfservicerepair.com/en-CA/order">tools</a>, and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/docs">manuals</a> to repair select iPhone, iPad, and Mac models, as well as the Studio Display and the Beats Pill. Apple says the program is "intended for individuals with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices."<br/>

Meanwhile, the Genuine Parts Distributor program allows repair shops that do not have a direct relationship with Apple to order genuine iPhone and iPad parts like displays, batteries, and cameras via select third-party distributors. In Canada, parts can be purchased from <a href="https://www.mobilesentrix.ca/gapp/">MobileSentrix</a>.
