<p>A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday repeatedly questioned the validity of the grand jury indictment against former FBI director James Comey after prosecutors acknowledged that the full grand jury never saw the final version of the indictment, a procedural lapse defense lawyers say could warrant dismissal before trial. The filings were secured by a prosecutor described in coverage as closely aligned with President Donald Trump, a fact that commentators say has added political scrutiny to the case&#x27;s handling. Comey&#x27;s lawyers asked the court to dismiss the charges, arguing the error and past grand jury disagreement over one proposed count undercut the indictment&#x27;s validity.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/egUAz6LJXZ12uofTB2UxKeKN-weQFkP9JcJ7cNO20xMsZcqopCtZI2_E-c3sMzG5gcEzIGmMMngPkzxJL8Ve1z_98PsaRqELD4pwqi5EVCTXXz40dAENDO5abyMk628gtTgx4vG7szqte1m7Wh-qNIFiN2li6eHMtnqK_c6ET-LdMMml344mlUFJrZEfDb4qx82EEv4RGC7gYZsPp4Ney0whk6imGM4IbzVQW4Q-Um5oWnExOcna9hT7IN46jOo_7rEau1GuwnMAwF6HgA' alt='FILE PHOTO: Former FBI Director James Comey speaks to the media after giving a private deposition to congressional committees on Capitol Hill, Dec. 7, 2018.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Presiding judge: U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff repeatedly challenged prosecutors&#x27; account at Wednesday&#x27;s hearing, directly rebuking the prosecutor over the procedural lapse</li><li>Defense claim: Comey&#x27;s lawyers told the court the failure to present the final indictment to all jurors is &#x27;another reason to dismiss the case entirely,&#x27; framing the mistake as part of what they call selective prosecution</li><li>Grand jury dispute: Reports say the grand jury had earlier rejected one proposed criminal count, raising questions about which version jurors actually approved and complicating prosecutors&#x27; narrative</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>James Comey legal team: Comey&#x27;s lawyers argued the procedural lapse is another reason to dismiss the case entirely.
