<p>There are three browser tabs continously used in my workflow: GMail, Google Calendar, and Google Play Music. I normally have many more tabs open, but these three I access periodically. As the number of open tabs increases, and I fail to cleanup, getting back to my usual three gets a little trickier.</p>
<p>So far, I've kept each of these services open in separate windows. But that doesn't always work. Click on any link in your inbox and you're back to playing cleanup. This is where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser">site-specific browsers</a> (SSB) can help.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dmarmor/epichrome">Epichrome</a> enables you to build Chrome-based SSBs (on Mac OSX). Build an SSB for the usual suspects and easily jump to them using the app switcher.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Enable the Chrome extension to open URLs in default browser.</p>

<p>And choose the default browser to open URLs.</p>
