<li>The adjustable spacers separate your toes to keep them from rubbing together and getting uncomfortable</li>
<li>The bunion correctors are basically single toe separators</li>
<li>Ideal for barefoot training, correcting hammer toe and all sorts of other toe stuff</li>
<li>Are they available in Georgia Red: No, they’re more like Ari-toe-na fans</li>
</ul><h1>Straighten Up</h1><p>We find ourselves, as humans, constantly chasing some beauty standard or another. A new haircut, a new style, a new diet, a new exercise routine–whatever it takes to see ourselves in the mirror and think, <em>Hey, nice!</em></p>
<p>And sure, this is natural. It can sometimes even be positive. You discover something that’s truly the best of both worlds: the haircut that perfectly frames your face while being easy to maintain; the wardrobe that’s extra comfortable and extra flattering; the diet that opens up exciting new culinary options; the workout that leaves you feeling great for hours.</p>
<p>But there are times when it goes too far, when we try and change things about ourselves that we shouldn’t, when we make ourselves uncomfortable and unhappy in order to fit in. In such cases, we should perform more radical self-acceptance.</p>
<p>You know, the way many of us do with our feet.</p>
<p>And, actually, on that subject, maybe we’ve gone a little too far.</p>
<p>Like, look, we get it. Some of us are born with lithe digits and great nail beds. But others of us? We got stubby little buddies and weird-shaped nails. And that’s totally fine. But beyond that, there are certain things we just put up with as if they can’t be changed or improved. Like toes that are too tightly packed and rub together, or overlapping, or adorned with big old bunions.</p>
<p>Which is to say nothing about the pain. Our head hurts? We take something for it. Our toe hurts, and we’re like, “Ha, ha, okay, little buddy! Relax!”</p>
<p>That’s what this stuff can help with.</p>
<p>The separators will… well… separate your toes. And that’s when you’re home, or when you’re out for an adventure in the wild, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H5W6GXTAUSGJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&tag=mehdown-20">according to Amazon user Barbi</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love these! They fit comfortably and I can wear them with my Hike Barefoot shoes. I bought a different pair many years ago and they were so huuuuge they were uncomfortable. I broke my leg several years ago and my right leg is shorter than my left, so my foot turns out to accommodate that. These help with that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the bunion correctors, they’re pretty much just single toe spacers. But they sure do help, <a href="https://www.target.com/p/zentoes-single-loop-toe-spacer-for-bunion-pain-relief-honey-2pk/-/A-86119273">says an anonymous Target reviewer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have hammer toe on my right big toe. Your spacer works very well in keeping the necessary space between big toe and #2. It allows me to work an eight hour shift on my feet with little to no discomfort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, these won’t change your feet entirely. But they might help them feel a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>So get some. And space out. Your toes, we mean.</p>
