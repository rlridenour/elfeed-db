Ahead of Earth Day on April 22, Apple plans to launch an in-store promotion that offers customers 10% off select Apple accessories when they bring in old electronics for free recycling, according to <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1912155413639807112"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

Apple has long <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in#recycle">offered to recycle</a> older devices, cables, cases, and accessories for free, as part of its environmental initiatives. Starting this Wednesday, customers who recycle electronics that are not eligible for trade-in credit at an Apple Store will temporarily qualify for up to &#36;20 off select Apple accessories, including the AirTag, AirPods, Apple Pencil, Apple Watch bands, iPhone cases, and the Magic Mouse/Trackpad/Keyboard trio for Macs.<br/>
<br/>
Apple even accepts certain electronics from other brands for free recycling, so it will be interesting to see what qualifies for this promotion.<br/>
<br/>
The promotion will run for one month, according to Gurman. It is unclear if the offer will be available in the U.S. only, or in multiple countries.<br/>

While a 10% discount is not significant, Apple rarely offers direct savings on its products beyond its annual Back to School and Black Friday events.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earth-day/">Earth Day</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/apple-to-launch-recycling-promotion/">Apple Stores to Offer 10% Off Accessories When You Recycle Electronics</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stores-to-offer-10-off-accessories-when-you-recycle-electronics.2455365/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
