<li>Sprays water in a nice way</li>
<li>Also does aromatherapy (optional)</li>
<li>Looks metal, but it’s plastic</li>
<li>Reviews say it feels durable and some think metal would be too heavy.  Let us know your thoughts in the forums.</li>
<li>Can it make a margarita: No, but if you think about it, cutting up and juicing limes to make margs is the original aromatherapy, isn’t it? (This makes sense to me)</li>
</ul><h1>Smell That?</h1><p>It’s a nice shower head. It mounts via magnet, meaning you can stand under it or take it down for a closer clean. And it has a massage-like spray.</p>
<p>Plus, you can pop in the included aromatherapy capsules for a little extra luxury.</p>
<p>Because of this last bit, we imagine it’ll go one of two ways for those of you who get one.</p>
<p><strong>Way #1</strong></p>
<p>You buy this thing <em>specifically</em> for the aromatherapy feature. For the first few weeks, every time you take a shower, you load in one of the Nespresso-looking pods and enjoy a soothing scent to go along with the soothing spray of hot water.</p>
<p>It’s amazing!</p>
<p>It feels so good, so relaxing!</p>
<p>Just the perfect way to unwind after a grueling day at the office or a rough workout!</p>
<p>Until, you know, you run out of the supply it came with. At which point, let’s be real, you’re not going to go online and buy a bunch of aromatherapy pods.</p>
<p>That’d be ridiculous.</p>
<p>And it’s kind of a bummer, right? Because that’s what drew you to the shower head in the first place. But, hey, on the positive side, now you have a nice new shower head!</p>
<p>Or…</p>
<p><strong>Way #2</strong></p>
<p>You buy this shower head for the shower head, rolling your eyes at the promise of aromatherapy. Lol, c’mon! You’re never gonna use that. A shower is a shower. There’s steam. There’s the smell of shampoo and soap. That’s all the “aromatherapy” you need!</p>
<p>But then again, it’s not like the pods are optional. They’re included in your order no matter what.</p>
<p>Which means it’d be <em>stupid</em> not to try one… right? Just to see how silly the whole thing is…</p>
<p>And, wow, holy shit. This is NICE, huh? Seriously, can you believe you used to shower with just the steam and the smell of the shampoo and soap as your only aromatherapy???</p>
<p>As soon as you’re down to your last few pods, you’re online, ordering a whole bunch more.</p>
<p>Because that’s just how it goes, right?</p>
<p>Or who knows, maybe you buy it for aromatherapy and keep restocking, or maybe you buy it just to have a shower head and you really never feel the temptation to try a pod.</p>
<p>Point is: this is a good budget shower head for an extra-budget price. So get one if you need a new shower head and/or some soothing aromas.</p>
