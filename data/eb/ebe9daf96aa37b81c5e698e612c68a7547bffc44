<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl-C5_RqJZg">the new <em>Architectural Digest</em> video above</a>, Michael Wyetzner talks about a fair few buildings we’ve featured over the years here on Open Culture: the <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2022/07/a-virtual-tour-of-frank-lloyd-wrights-lost-japanese-masterpiece-the-imperial-hotel-in-tokyo.html">Imperial Hotel</a>, the <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2024/10/take-a-tour-of-frank-lloyd-wrights-ennis-house.html">Ennis House</a>, <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2015/08/take-a-360-virtual-tour-of-taliesin-frank-lloyd-wrights-personal-home-studio.html">Taliesin</a>, <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2025/04/a-meditative-tour-of-fallingwater-frank-lloyd-wrights-architectural-masterpiece.html">Fallingwater</a>. These are all, of course, the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, who still stands as the embodiment of American architecture more than 65 years after his death. That’s a fairly long stretch by modern standards, but nevertheless a shorter one than Wright’s career, which ran over 70 years. During his long life, Wyetzner explains, Wright witnessed the introduction of indoor plumbing, electricity, the telephone, the automobile, the airplane, the radio, television, and space travel — and even given that, his architecture shows a dramatic evolution.</p>
<p>Beginning with Wright’s apprenticeship in Chicago under Louis Sullivan, “the father of modernism,” Wyetzner continues on to his development of the horizontal indoor-outdoor “Prairie Style” house; his Japanese commissions and subsequent much-photographed Los Angeles houses; the emergence of his philosophy of “organic architecture” meant to unify the building with its site and natural environment; his discovery of the desert; and his Depression-era conception of the “Usonian house,” which adapted his refined spatial sensibility for American-style mass production. This would be more than enough for even the most distinguished architect’s career. Yet it doesn’t even get around to such projects as the Unity Temple, <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2022/09/what-its-like-to-work-in-frank-lloyd-wrights-iconic-office-building.html">Johnson Wax Headquarters</a>, the <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2023/09/why-frank-lloyd-wright-designed-a-gas-station-in-minnesota-1958.html">R. W. Lindholm Service Station</a>, the <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2024/08/frank-lloyd-wright-thought-about-making-the-guggenheim-museum-pink.html">Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</a>, or his first and last <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2022/07/when-frank-lloyd-wright-designed-a-doghouse-his-smallest-architectural-creation-1956.html">doghouse</a>.</p>
<p>No matter which period of Wright’s career you examine, you can find evidence for his belief in the inspiration of place, in organic aesthetics, in structural expressiveness, and even in indirect moral instruction. Yet it’s also possible to imagine that, in some sense, a series of different Frank Lloyd Wrights existed, repeatedly destroyed and recreated by professional setback, personal disaster, foreign sojourn, immersion in a new landscape, or even acquaintance with a new technology. Surely no one could remain productive to the end of his 92 years without a little re-invention. During that time, he designed more than 1,000 projects, only about half of which were ever built. Young architects who idolize Frank Lloyd Wright would do well to remember that he, too, knew full well the sting of never making it to construction.</p>
