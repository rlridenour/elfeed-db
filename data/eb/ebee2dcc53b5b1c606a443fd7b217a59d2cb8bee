<p>Bungie:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media
and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear. We’ve taken
this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft <em>Marathon</em>
into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much
discussion within our Dev team, we’ve made the decision to delay
the September 23rd release.</p>

<p>The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and
focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling — survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every
corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s
genre-defining FPS combat.</p>

<p>We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense,
high-stakes experience that a title like <em>Marathon</em> is built
around. This means deepening the relationship between the
developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation to plain English: <em>The game as currently imagined stinks, so we’re going back to the drawing board. We can’t explain why we, the game’s developers, didn’t know that it stunk, and instead seemingly needed to wait for scathing alpha test feedback from players — but Occam’s Razor clearly suggests the problem is that decisions at Bungie are made by executives with no taste.</em></p>
