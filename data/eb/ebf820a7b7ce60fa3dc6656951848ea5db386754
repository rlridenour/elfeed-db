Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> experience is still nowhere to be seen following Porsche's <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2025/products/porsche-communication-management-change-of-the-model-year-38985.html">announcement</a> of a major upgrade of its infotainment system for 2026.<br/>

The upcoming 2026 model year Porsche Taycan, 911, Panamera, and Cayenne feature an upgraded version of the Porsche Communication Management (PCM) system, making it more responsive, adding Dolby Atmos support, and integrating Amazon's Alexa voice assistant. The new system brings the Porsche App Center, a kind of app store for the vehicle,  to all of the new models.<br/>
<br/>
It continues to support the standard version of Apple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; and Android Auto. Support for Apple's next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; experience is again conspicuously missing from Porsche's new lineup, and the automaker did not mention it at all during its latest announcement—another bleak sign for the delayed feature.<br/>
<br/>
Next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will have deeper integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster, climate controls, FM radio, and more. It will also support multiple displays across the dashboard, and offer widgets for apps like Calendar and Weather. In addition, next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will be highly customizable, allowing automakers to tailor the design of the system to match their vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">first previewed next-generation CarPlay</a> at WWDC 2022. Until the end of last year, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple's website</a> said that the first vehicles with next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; support would "arrive in 2024," but this did not occur.<br/>
<br/>
Aston Martin and Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed next-generation CarPlay vehicle designs</a> in late 2023, but neither automaker has announced any vehicles with support for it. Apple continued to highlight next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-next-generation-carplay-images/">in WWDC 2024 coding sessions</a> for developers and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/apple-statement-on-next-generation-carplay/">shared a statement</a> in January reiterating its commitment to the feature.<br/>
<br/>
When it unveiled next-generation &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; in 2022, Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. Nearly three years have gone by since Apple shared that list, however, so it is unclear if it remains entirely accurate.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/porsche/">Porsche</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/26/2026-porsches-still-wont-have-next-gen-carplay/">2026 Porsches Still Won&#039;t Have Next-Gen CarPlay</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2026-porsches-still-wont-have-next-gen-carplay.2454086/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
