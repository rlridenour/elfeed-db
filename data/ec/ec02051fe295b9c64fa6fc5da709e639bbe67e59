Apple's first foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> will feature relocated volume buttons, an all-black camera plateau, a smaller <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, and more, according to design leaks from a known Weibo leaker.<br/>

The user known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>" today claimed to share several key details about the design of the foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li>The volume buttons will be located on the top edge of the device, aligned to the right, similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>.</li><br/>
	<li>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> power button and Camera Control continue to be located on the right edge of the device, just like other recent iPhones.</li><br/>
	<li>The left side of the device is smooth and does not have any buttons.</li><br/>
	<li>The front-facing cameras feature a single punch-hole design, resulting in a smaller &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;.</li><br/>
	<li>The back left of the device features an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air-style camera plateau, containing two horizontally arranged cameras, the microphone, and the flash. Unlike the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a>, the camera plateau appears to be completely black and not match the color of the device's body.</li><br/>
	<li>The only "confirmed" color option is said to be white, but a single additional color is expected to be available upon launch, giving customers just two choices.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The motherboard is apparently located on the right side of the device. As to not run cables across the screen to the left side for the volume buttons (where they are located on all other &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models), Apple is said to have decided to run them directly upwards, which maximizes internal space.<br/>
<br/>
The internal structure purportedly features an innovative stacked design, with the space being almost entirely dedicated to the display and battery. It is also said to feature the biggest battery ever used in an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. <br/>

<br/>
For the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> alone, the leaker reported the device's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/will-iphone-17-pro-start-at-256gb-storage/">256GB base storage configuration</a> and its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/15/iphone-17-pro-max-telephoto-camera-rumor/">improved telephoto camera</a>, as well as its improved <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/03/new-iphone-17-pro-details/">battery life, thermal design, and display brightness</a>. As a result, their reports are worth taking seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Other rumors suggest that Apple's first foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will feature a 7.8-inch crease-free inner display, a 5.5-inch cover display, &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj;, two rear cameras, the A20 chip, and the "C2" modem. It is expected to launch alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max later this year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/02/first-foldable-iphone-design-details-revealed/">First Foldable iPhone Design Details Revealed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-foldable-iphone-design-details-revealed.2477047/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
