<p>Yet again, I&rsquo;ve tweaked my <a href="https://github.com/ashton314/.dotfiles">emacs configuration</a>. The big change this time is switching to <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Ivy</a> from <a href="https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/">Helm</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to say right off the bat that Helm is a great tool. I used it for several months and enjoyed it. Once thing that I love about helm is how discoverable it makes commands and functions. helm also got me into using bookmarks. I don&rsquo;t keep many bookmarks; I tend to collect a few when working on a multi-file project long-term. The bookmark that I use most consistently is to my <code>.emacs</code> file; these days I&rsquo;m fiddling constantly with my settings.</p>
<p>I switched to Ivy because I found its completion options to be <em>killer</em> when using <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>: being able to fuzzy match branch names was sooo nice. I&rsquo;ve also liked how Ivy handled completing file names. I <em>feel</em> faster. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m that much faster navigating around my file tree with it, but it does feel nice. There&rsquo;s so much that Ivy makes better: any function using <code>completing-read</code> benefits from Ivy&rsquo;s fuzzy matching.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a gradual process; there&rsquo;s a lot that Helm does out-of-the-box that Ivy took some tweaking to get right. For example, sorting candidates for <code>M-x</code> by most recently used was one of my favorite features of Helm. I had to install <a href="https://melpa.org/#/ivy-prescient">Ivy Prescient</a> to get the behavior I wanted. On top of that, I needed <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#counsel">Counsel</a> to show the key bindings next to their functions in <code>M-x</code>. Finally, I like to be able to fuzzy match anywhere within the command name, so I took out the leading <code>^</code> in counsel with this:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">
  Conclusion

</h2>
<p>Both Helm and Ivy are fantastic packages. They&rsquo;ve changed the way I use Emacs and I feel like they&rsquo;ve made me substantially more productive and happy. If you haven&rsquo;t used either, you might want to start off with Helm for a nice out-of-the-box experience with loads of features and sensible defaults. However, if you just would like to be able to fuzzy-match things, Ivy is your library. It&rsquo;s fast, clean, and configurable. The only problem is that it sometimes requires configuration before it&rsquo;s exactly how you like it.</p>
