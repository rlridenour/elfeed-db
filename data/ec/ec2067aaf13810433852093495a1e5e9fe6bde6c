<blockquote>
  <p>Apple removed an app for preserving TikToks, Instagram reels, news
reports, and videos documenting abuses by ICE, 404 Media has
learned. The app, called Eyes Up, differs from other banned apps
such as ICEBlock which were designed to report sightings of ICE
officials in real-time to warn local communities. Eyes Up,
meanwhile, was more of an aggregation service pooling together
information to preserve evidence in case the material is needed in
the future in court.</p>

<p>The news shows <a href="https://www.404media.co/iceblock-owner-after-apple-removes-app-we-are-determined-to-fight-this/">that Apple</a> <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-calls-ice-agents-a-vulnerable-group-removes-ice-spotting-app-red-dot/">and Google’s</a> crackdown
on ICE-spotting apps, which started after pressure from the
Department of Justice against Apple, is broader in scope than apps
that report sightings of ICE officials. It has also impacted at
least one app that was more about creating a historical record of
ICE’s activity during its mass deportation effort.</p>

<p>“Our goal is government accountability, we aren’t even doing
real-time tracking,” the administrator of Eyes Up, who said their
name was Mark, told 404 Media. Mark asked 404 Media to only use
his first name to protect him from retaliation. “I think the
[Trump] admin is just embarrassed by how many incriminating
videos we have.”</p>

<p>Sometimes consistency is a bad thing.</p>
