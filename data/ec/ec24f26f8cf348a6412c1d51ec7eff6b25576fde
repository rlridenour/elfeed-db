<blockquote>
  <p>On a recent Saturday afternoon, Kendall Mayes was mindlessly
scrolling on X when she noticed an unsettling trend surface on her
feed. Users were prompting Grok, the platform’s built-in AI
feature, to “nudify” women’s images. Mayes, a 25-year-old media
professional from Texas who uses X to post photos with her friends
and keep up with news, didn’t think it would happen to her — until it did.</p>

<p>“Put her in a tight clear transparent bikini,” an X user ordered
the bot under a photo that Mayes posted from when she was 20. Grok
complied, replacing her white shirt with a clear bikini top. The
waistband of her jeans and black belt dissolved into thin,
translucent strings. The see-through top made the upper half of
her body look realistically naked.</p>

<p>Hiding behind an anonymous profile, the user’s page was filled
with similar images of women, digitally and nonconsensually
altered and sexualized. Mayes wanted to cuss the faceless user
out, but decided to simply block the account. She hoped that would
be the end of it. Soon, however, her comments became littered with
more images of herself in clear bikinis and skin-tight latex
bodysuits. Mayes says that all of the requests came from anonymous
profiles that also targeted other women. Though some users have
had their accounts suspended, as of publication, some of the
images of Mayes are still up on X.</p>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Emma, a content creator, was at the grocery store when she saw the
notifications of people asking Grok to undress her images. [...]
Numbness washed over Emma when the images finally loaded on her
timeline. A selfie of her holding a cat had been transformed into
a nude. The cat was removed from the photo, Emma says, and her
upper body was made naked.</p>

<p>Emma immediately made her account private and reported the images.
In an email response reviewed by Rolling Stone, X User Support
asked her to upload an image of her government-issued ID so they
could look into the report, but Emma responded that she didn’t
feel comfortable doing so. [...] In our call, she checked to see
if some of the image edits she was aware of were still up on X.
They were. “Oh, my God,” she says, letting out a defeated sigh.
“It has 15,000 views. Oh, that’s so sad.”</p>
