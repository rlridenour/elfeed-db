<p>I mentioned on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@drdrang/114870784206883912">Mastodon</a> how much I enjoyed Myke Hurley’s interview of John Gruber on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex/169">the most recent episode of Cortex</a>. One part that particularly resonated with me was when Gruber spoke of all the online bookmark managers he’s used over the years and how none of them have stuck. It was like I was listening to myself. So when he said he’s shifted to using a Shortcut that saves the page he’s looking at to a list in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot/id1491071483?mt=12">Tot</a>, I figured I’d give it a try.</p>
<p>I wrote some Tot Shortcuts last year: one for <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2024/07/tot-notes/">dictating short notes</a> that includes the date, time and location; and another for <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2024/08/tot-shopping-redux/">cleaning up my shopping lists</a> after a trip to the store. I still use them, and I still like Tot in general as a place to put ephemeral notes. I used Drafts for many years, but never cleared out the old notes; Tot’s seven-note limit forces me to keep temporary text temporary.</p>
<p>I keep the links in the 6th dot. Here’s what it looks like on the Mac:</p>
<p><img alt="Tot dot 6 with links" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2025/20250720-Tot%20dot%206%20with%20links.png" title="Tot dot 6 with links" width="80%"/></p>
<p>For each link, it saves the date, title, and URL on successive lines. Blank lines separate the entries. It sounds as if Gruber’s system is more sophisticated, with an automation that runs every night to (I think) add a date header that applies to all the links saved on that day. That would make the list more compact, but I’m not going to take that step until I know I’ll actually keep using this system.</p>
<p>What is the system? It’s just this Shortcut, which you can make for yourself or <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d23e9c5934fd473cb43887060d58645e">download</a>:</p>

<p>Not much to it, which is why I don’t feel bad about building it, even though my track record for saving links is pretty poor. My goal is to use this only for links to pages I intend to write about and to clear them when the post is written. Tot will help with that by getting crowded quickly.</p>
<p>To make it easy to use this Shortcut, I’ve <a href="https://osxdaily.com/2020/06/16/how-to-add-to-edit-sharing-menu-options-on-iphone-ipad/">added it to my favorites</a>. It appears just below <span class="menu">Copy</span> in that section of the Share Sheet on both my iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p><img alt="Shortcut added to Favorites" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2025/20250720-Shortcut%20added%20to%20Favorites.png" title="Shortcut added to Favorites" width="60%"/></p>
<p>Running a Shortcut from the Mac Share Sheet takes more clicking than I’d like, so if I use this enough to get frustrated by the extra work, I’ll probably make a <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> macro that does the same thing.</p>
