<p>Mike Florio, NBC Sports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And while the Guardians <a href="https://x.com/ZackMeisel/status/1946961807198875727">stood up and responded to Trump</a>, the
Commanders are hiding under the bed. With the NFL right next
to them.</p>

<p>We’ve sent multiple emails to both the team and the league seeking
comment on one of the biggest stories in all of sports. No one has
responded. It’s a common, low-tech, P.R. play. Ignore the request,
and maybe the reporter will forget about it. Force the reporter to
remember, and to ask again. And maybe again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the statement from Guardians team president Chris Antonetti:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I understand there are very different perspectives on the
decision we made a few years ago, but it’s a decision we made and
we’ve gotten the opportunity to build the brand as the Guardians
over the last four years and we’re excited about the future that’s
in front of us.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d recommend going a little further and saying that everyone in the organization loves the new brand, but that’s quibbling. What the Commanders and the NFL are doing is cowardice.</p>
