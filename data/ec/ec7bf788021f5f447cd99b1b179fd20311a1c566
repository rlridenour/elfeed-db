I remember why it was hard to watch the first time and the second time wasn't easier.</p><p>This movie is too real to dismiss as just another "Batman" movie. While dramatized, the events in the film revolve around a realistic situation of a realistic mental illness of a potentially realistic person. I'm not surprised to see that most of the negative criticism came from prestigious places like the New Yorker or the NYT: these are exactly the guys that would miss the point.</p>
