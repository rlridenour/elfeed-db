<p>Army officers in Guinea-Bissau appeared on state television saying they had removed President Umaro Sissoco Embaló from office, suspended the electoral process and closed the country’s borders, just days after a closely fought presidential vote and on the eve of provisional results being announced. The officers, calling themselves the &quot;High Military Command for the Restoration of Order,&quot; announced a nightly curfew, the dissolution of state institutions and the suspension of several media outlets while they take charge &quot;until further notice&quot;. Embaló told French media that he had been arrested and deposed, but the main opposition candidate instead accused him of staging a fake coup to delay an unfavourable result and cling to power. The takeover adds another episode to a string of recent military interventions in West Africa and raises concern over democratic backsliding in a country that has struggled with political instability for decades.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/eTtzMwX9bXiMyugurt74d9g-II7bh6L_nCK79Eo-hDBllSShhuYvX5gW1liztzTnm_7PD0YgIfPZ-efdUE_deutpYbLzJxeOdVUgSITw0Q5W4vX3XpMM9-IL94dZFWmEjWkB1rWbxp7gDJTQswSZLGrF3i5x3NjyZ8dRyt-NES5uU2lcWk1av2LWvjHeoX4KE84MeqAFKbgityp78C7Aa2s-IODzChm-O16pysQU2zu8LMlKMX3O2gFsEwdsuahhK555XwnRJ9URzpRQ7w' alt='Soldiers patrol a main road in Bissau after army officers announced they had seized power in Guinea-Bissau.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Election context: The coup announcement came three days after a hotly contested presidential election in which Embaló, who campaigned on having brought stability since 2020, faced strong opposition criticism over governance and corruption allegations.</li><li>Security measures: Following the televised statement, soldiers patrolled main roads in Bissau, gunfire was reported near the presidential palace, and troops blocked access to government buildings around the capital.</li><li>Media and communication: Military officials ordered several media outlets off the air and took control of state broadcaster facilities, significantly limiting independent reporting from within Guinea-Bissau.</li><li>Opposition’s claim: Opposition leader Domingos Simões Pereira alleged that Embaló orchestrated the putsch himself, describing it as a manoeuvre to interrupt the release of results that he believed would show the president losing the election.</li><li>Regional backdrop: The events in Bissau follow recent military takeovers in other West African states, prompting regional observers to warn that the pattern could further weaken the Economic Community of West African States’ efforts to defend constitutional rule in the region.</li></ul><blockquote>Stability has been achieved - Umaro Sissoco Embaló</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>High Military Command for the Restoration of Order: The officers said they had assumed &quot;total control&quot; of the country and framed their actions as necessary to restore order and correct alleged irregularities in the electoral process.
