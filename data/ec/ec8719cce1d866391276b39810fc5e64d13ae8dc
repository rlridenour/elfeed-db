Priests and other religious leaders of various persuasions have been known to use Emacs. It&rsquo;s not common, of course, but Irreal has mentioned a couple of them—most recently <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13191">Randy Ridenour</a>—but in almost 16 years, I can&rsquo;t remember more than two.

Until now. MykhailoKazarian is a priest in the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and is far from a casual Emacs users. Rather than using Emacs to write his sermons, papers, and keep church records, Father Mykhailo is an actual coder who&rsquo;s worked with Pascal, Python, and Java.

Due to the current difficulties in the Ukraine, Father Mykhailo has had to work with less than ideal conditions, including poor Internet connections and—what some would call—under powered hardware. Through it all he&rsquo;s been an Emacs user. He says <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1niadv5/still_using_emacs_in_2025_yes_and_heres_why/">he&rsquo;s still an Emacs user in 2025</a> and has a long post on why.

One of the things you often hear about Emacs is that it&rsquo;s bloated, needs a lot of memory, and won&rsquo;t run reasonably on anything but the most powerful hardware. Put aside, for the moment, the history of Emacs that puts the lie to that claim, Father Mykhailo is running Emacs on a Raspberry Pi—sometimes, when conditions warrant, powered by an automobile battery—and still manages to enjoy the many benefit that Emacs offers.

Father Mykhailo&rsquo;s post goes into a lot of detail on why he&rsquo;s still using Emacs after 20 years and plans to keep on using it. Take a look at his post for a deeper dive.</p>
