<p>The US Justice Department has released another large tranche of records from its Jeffrey Epstein investigation, saying it made public more than three million pages of material along with thousands of videos and a large set of images. Officials said the disclosure is meant to meet requirements of a new transparency law passed by Congress, after months of public and political pressure to open the files. The department said it reviewed and redacted parts of the release to protect victims and avoid exposing identifying information, including redacting images of women except those of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in recruiting underage girls for Epstein. The document dump has reignited political debate in Washington, including scrutiny of how fully and how quickly the government complied with the statutory deadline and what the records show about Epstein’s associations with prominent figures. While the Epstein case remains closely tied to painful allegations of abuse, the release also reflects a concrete step toward transparency and accountability, with officials inviting potential victims to report redaction mistakes so they can be corrected.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/NG9Vikp9W7-E4fCgi3TaMlXv45Z1Ei0oDiEWqY2_gu3uj2s5oqmcDBC-4xygHrizJ0t9lU5apRROfbUejZXe5rjKslcf9idYs3oChghbT4C-qUESCSZC9YLWdUOqMrbbWA2u0Iv-OsetwQq694Bw9nvIjlK5p0Y6ZzvVNKQaLPahGJj71jkoYdsK8KL9W2mI5MGUQua5zc1Zoj_pQQRV8iRumSmi09U1RMOVjYGpkdG8ID7Mx0ZFEqzo4v6Hc5h9XlM' alt='Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche speaks at the Justice Department in Washington on January 30, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>What’s included: The DOJ said the release package included more than 2,000 videos and about 180,000 images in addition to pages of records.</li><li>Deadline dispute: Politico reported the release came more than a month after the Dec. 19 statutory deadline, and DW noted some Democratic politicians questioned whether all legally required materials were made public.</li><li>Trump claims: Le Monde reported the DOJ statement said some submissions contained “untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump” sent to the FBI before the 2020 election, and the department described those claims as “unfounded and false”.</li><li>Uncharged names: Dawn reported earlier-released FBI emails from July 2019 referenced 10 alleged “co-conspirators,” but the names were redacted, and Maxwell is the only person charged in connection with Epstein’s crimes.</li><li>Missing records: Axios, cited by Dawn, said some significant items not yet released include a draft federal indictment and an 82-page prosecution memo from 2007.</li></ul><blockquote>Today’s release marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process to ensure transparency to the American people and compliance with the act - Todd Blanche</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US Justice Department: The department said the release fulfills its legal obligations under the transparency law and followed an extensive review and redaction process to protect victims and comply with the act.
