<p>I do change my workflow from time to time to keep myself in shape.</p>
<p>Now, once again, I&rsquo;m trying to switch back to Emacs. This time I decided to go with Doom.
I already tried to install use it but it didn&rsquo;t work well for me and I didn&rsquo;t bother to change
the configuration.</p>
<h2 id="main-functionalities-i-need">Main functionalities I need</h2>
<h3 id="quick-search-in-a-project">Quick search in a project</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I used <code>ag</code> for in my Vim. I could easily look for a word under the cursor everywhere in the project.</p>
<p>Projectile fortunately have something like this as well and I can search for word under cursor with <code>SPC-*</code>.
The issue though is in PHP the word under cursor was including <code>$</code> sign which is not want I wanted.</p>
<p>Fixed by excluding <code>$</code> sign from part of a keyword</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(after! php-mode
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> (<span style="color:#a6e22e">modify-syntax-entry</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">?$</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;.&#34;</span> php-mode-syntax-table))
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="git-interface">Git interface</h3>
<p>I usually use <code>git</code> in terminal to create a branch, for merging, branch switching.
But I need a quick way to stage files and write commit messages.</p>
<p>Magit is definitely the suits my needs here.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-cursors">Multiple cursors</h3>
<p>Doom has <code>multiple-cursors</code> package. For some reason it doesn&rsquo;t bind anything and I had to manually bind <code>M-d</code> to <code>evil-multiedit-match-and-next</code></p>
<h3 id="tasks-management--notes">Tasks management / Notes</h3>
<p>Well, in Vim I didn&rsquo;t have any good tool for this. I usually switched to Obsidian to take notes.</p>
<p>With Emacs there is org-mode and that&rsquo;s the primary reason why I&rsquo;m even switching to Emacs right now.</p>
<h3 id="projects-management">Projects management</h3>
<p>I used Vim with Tmux and every tmux session was created per project. Every session had windows for vim, terminal operations, background jobs.</p>
<p>In Doom we already have Projectile included. There are also workspaces.</p>
<p>These two packages are great for managing projects and buffers.</p>
<h2 id="issues-that-i-still-need-to-solve">Issues that I still need to solve</h2>
<h3 id="php-mode-is-slow">php-mode is slow</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s something I didn&rsquo;t notice many years ago when I was using Emacs.
Hard to tell if this is related to Evil mode enabled or some other Doom related configuration but when I try to
<code>evil-shift-right</code> with more than 50 lines selected I have to wait some time for this action to happen.</p>
<h3 id="magit-is-slow">magit is slow</h3>
<p>Magit is pretty quick for small editings. But when I have, let&rsquo;s say a merge conflict with a lot of files it takes
5-10 seconds for magit to open. It obviously depends on exact amount of files to show there but that&rsquo;s pretty painful.
Of course every other subsequent command is also slow.</p>
<h3 id="company-mode-doesnt-autocomplete">company-mode doesn&rsquo;t autocomplete</h3>
<p>Company in my case didn&rsquo;t want to autocomplete by default. The reason was that company backends chosen in doom don&rsquo;t really work at least on
my projects.</p>
<p>Moreover when I try to set <code>company-backends</code> variable to something I need and open a php file the variable updates automatically
and <code>company-capf</code> with <code>company-yasnippet</code> is prepended to the list of backends.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Overall Doom experience is pretty nice. Configuration is hard sometimes because Doom sets some package variables, add hooks here and there
and changes configuration of packages to some non-default behavior.
It makes a bit more complex to setup a package/mode to something I need.</p>
<p>Maybe I should have chosen Doom in the first place because I already have some habits and needs that I want to have in my editor
while Doom is probably good if you don&rsquo;t have those habits or want to change them.</p>
