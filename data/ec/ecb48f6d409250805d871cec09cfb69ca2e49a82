<p>Australia’s federal government says it will recall parliament two weeks early to introduce a package of hate-speech and gun measures after the Bondi Beach attack, which authorities have described as a terrorist atrocity. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said lawmakers will return next week for a condolence motion before debating reforms aimed at curbing extremist incitement and tightening firearm rules. The proposed laws include new criminal offences targeting people who preach hatred, tougher penalties for hate crimes, and expanded restrictions on prohibited symbols, with ministers arguing the changes are intended to protect social cohesion and public safety.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/5sGl0au9TVRdNlFdjUlDPaLBptIJ44KltGstLXmDowrf0cfvpXrAku-1va1ehMkOrenyEJkV2kUyhtliM-VOlg3b2iBLa666lnllmNbTxfl0m4cbNNRwpiAz_RIE2UnASNRh_ymW44mj5rphHIprHBrWcJpSgFpQYDm8LshW0aUogDixIvX01uKwp0grGev2IoB_f58Lht5YH0CP_aNtiL5b5C16cIjpGYEyM8CXKR3bm0ARLBJaa-HSkw' alt='Anthony Albanese will recall parliament for Monday and Tuesday next week.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>New offences: The legislative package would create new offences aimed at “hate preachers,” including a specific offence for inciting hatred to intimidate or harass, according to government statements reported in Australian media.</li><li>Sentencing focus: Under the proposal, courts would explicitly take extremist motivation into account at sentencing, alongside increased penalties for hate crimes.</li><li>Symbol restrictions: The government plans to expand and strengthen Australia’s ban on prohibited Nazi symbols and also broaden restrictions on other prohibited symbols, as outlined in reporting on the bill.</li><li>Visa powers: The package would make it easier for the home affairs minister to cancel or refuse visas for people the government says intend to spread hatred in Australia.</li><li>Gun buyback: The bill would establish a National Guns Buyback Scheme and introduce limits on how many firearms one person can own, according to details published alongside the hate-law measures.</li></ul><blockquote>Let me be clear – once these laws are passed, they will be the toughest hate laws Australia has ever seen - Michelle Rowland</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese: Albanese said parliament will begin with a condolence motion to recognise trauma from the Bondi attack, honour bystanders and first responders, and commit the legislature to combating antisemitism and extremism.
