<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The laureate of the Ernest-John Solvay Excellence Prize 2025 in Cultural Sciences is Professor Bence Nanay, a philosopher and </em><em>cognitive scientist at the University of Antwerp. Nanay demonstrates that philosophy does not have to be a closed system. His interdisciplinary work, which also incorporates technology, contributes to a better understanding of how people think and what influences this. In this way, he proves how socially relevant the classical discipline of philosophy can be.</em> (translated by Google)</p>
