<p>In the latest development, Australia’s state of Victoria has declared a state of disaster as major bushfires continue to burn across the southeast during a heatwave, with temperatures reported above 40°C (104°F). Authorities say the fires have destroyed homes and other structures and have burned large areas of bushland, warning the emergency could last for weeks. Thousands of firefighters are working on multiple blazes, while officials urge residents in high-risk areas to leave early if told to evacuate.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/C80azn0Tsex72BWIWTef7ENzuE82borMygI6okrTM8fDNNyMtPC8RJYbInG1z9VMYqtSroHytuEKi7OWzjs8bqGLmdc0OimdbsnIYM2byxNoTIjZ2JP5HwoFIrSi8_t81mNF8G-85qA0yo2yw7jKzOfrbivvjvWIJuIvK1Q9-s4AOjiz1WETuMDfwilm2ocB1J9UnFR66S7GuxqTaZECmQ1O4zTySEh4PxxBnHOwpANqZ3-kgmV5i8hgaMl5' alt='The aftermath of a fire in Natimuk, Western Victoria.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Rescues and reunions: Three people previously reported missing were later found safe, offering a note of relief amid the ongoing emergency.</li><li>Transport disruption: Fire damage forced the closure of the Bendigo railway line, adding travel and freight disruption in affected parts of Victoria.</li><li>Interstate support: New South Wales began sending additional firefighting strike teams to Victoria after a request for assistance, supplementing crews already deployed across the border.</li><li>Cyclone concerns: While Victoria battles fire, northern Queensland’s Townsville has also been bracing for a cyclone, highlighting the strain of concurrent weather threats across Australia.</li><li>Resource criticism: A separate analysis argued federal and Victorian Labor governments were unprepared and had not provided sufficient resources to prevent such a disaster.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Victorian authorities: Officials declared a state of disaster and emphasized early evacuation messaging for communities facing extreme fire danger.
