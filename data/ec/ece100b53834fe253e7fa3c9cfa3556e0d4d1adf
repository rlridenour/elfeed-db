Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17e is set to launch "imminently" with at least four new features, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

In the latest edition of his "<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk">Power On</a>" newsletter, Gurman said that the new lost-cost &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will feature the A19 chip first introduced with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> last year. The device will also address one of the most glaring omissions from the current generation and add <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> connectivity. The device is also apparently set to feature Apple's latest cellular modem, the C1X chip, as well as its N1 chip for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Thread connectivity.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman added that the device is set to be sold at the same &#36;599 starting price as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, proposing to offer more features for the same cost. Apple is said to be planning to market the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e heavily to users in emerging markets and enterprises, and could benefit from weakened competition in the segment from competitors like Google and Samsung. <br/>
