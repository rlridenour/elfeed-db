<p><a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2017/12/05/the-feynman-ciphers/">Back in 2017</a> I wrote about the Feynman ciphers, three coded messages that had been presented as challenges to Richard Feynman in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Feynman couldn&#8217;t crack them, and even at the time of my post only the first of the three had been decoded &#8212; it turned out to be a transposition of the opening of Chaucer&#8217;s <em>Canterbury Tales</em> in Middle English. But in May 2023 <a href="https://codewarrior0.github.io/cipher-blog/2023/05/27/feynman-solved.html">David Vierra solved the other two</a> &#8212; one turns out to be an excerpt from A.E. Housman&#8217;s 1896 poem &#8220;Terence, This is Stupid Stuff,&#8221; and the other is the start of Feynman&#8217;s 1953 paper &#8220;Atomic Theory of the &#955; Transition in Helium,&#8221; from <em>The Physical Review</em>.</p>
<p>Who was the &#8220;fellow scientist&#8221; who had devised these challenges? Nick Pelling thinks the most likely candidate is Paul Olum, who had been Feynman&#8217;s officemate at Los Alamos in the 1940s, but hard evidence is lacking.
