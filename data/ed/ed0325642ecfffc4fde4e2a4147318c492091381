<p>Many Mac gamers are fans of <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover">CrossOver</a>, a Mac application that enables you to run native Windows software on macOS. When compatible, it’s an easy way to play PC games on your Mac. I once used it to play a PC-only Star Wars online role-playing game (RPG) on my Mac. I stopped not because CrossOver failed, but because I realized I can’t be trusted with an online RPG.</p>



<p>The latest version, <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/mjohnson/2025/3/11/experience-next-level-gaming-on-mac-with-crossover-25">CrossOver 25</a>, introduces several enhancements, including the ability to play popular PC games like <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. It’s built on Wine 10.0, incorporating over 5,000 improvements that benefit many applications. Notably, CrossOver doesn’t require a Windows license, making it a straightforward solution for running Windows apps on your Mac.</p>



<p>If you’re using a Mac and are missing your PC games, <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover">CrossOver 25</a> might be the answer you’re looking for.</p>



<p>CrossOver can also run PC productivity apps, too. I have a friend that uses it to run an ancient Windows version of Quicken. (Long story…)</p>
