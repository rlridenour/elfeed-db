<blockquote><p>
Paris newspapers once carried an ad offering a cheap and pleasant way of travelling for the price of 25 centimes. Several simpletons mailed this sum. Each received a letter of the following content:</p>
<p>&#8216;Sir, rest at peace in bed and remember that the earth turns. At the 49th parallel &#8212; that of Paris &#8212; you travel more than 25,000 km a day. Should you want a nice view, draw your curtain aside and admire the starry sky.&#8217;</p>
<p>The man who sent these letters was found and tried for fraud. The story goes that after quietly listening to the verdict and paying the fine demanded, the culprit struck a theatrical pose and solemnly declared, repeating Galileo&#8217;s famous words: &#8216;It turns.&#8217;
