It&rsquo;s been about a month since JTR (over at <a href="https://taonaw.com">TAONAW</a>) and I started using <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/journelly-open-for-beta">Journelly</a>. Although it&rsquo;s still in beta—but approaching its release date—I&rsquo;ve nevertheless come to rely on it for my memo book. It&rsquo;s smooth integration with Org mode and Emacs makes it a natural iOS front end for Org and a perfect fit for my memo book. Keeping its file in Org format and syncing it to my Mac make it really easy to integrate it into my Emacs workflow.

JTR has a post <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/04/27/a-month-with-journelly.html#fnr.3">reporting on his own experience with using Journelly over the last month</a>. Like me, he&rsquo;s settled into using Journelly as part of his day-to-day work and depends on it even though it&rsquo;s still beta software. As I discussed the last time I wrote about JTR and his use of Journelly, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12908">he uses it as a staging area for his other Org files</a>. That appears to be working well for him and he&rsquo;s been refining his workflow as he gains experience with the app.

One of his major concerns is dealing with the photos that he adds to the entries. He likes to tweak them in various ways such as reducing their resolution and sometimes even editing the photo itself. Happily, I don&rsquo;t have those problems. I suppose it might happen that I need to work on a photo for some reason or another but I can do that from the comfort of my Mac.<br />
If you&rsquo;re dealing with the Journelly photos a lot, you might want to read about how JTR deals with the fact that Journelly names them with unique IDs that give no clue as to what the photo is of. The TL;DR is that he uses Dired thumbnails to see what each picture is about. The photos are kept in a separate file so it&rsquo;s easy to display the thumbnails in Dired.

As I&rsquo;ve said before, Journelly can adapt itself to a variety of workflows so it&rsquo;s worth your while to read about as many of them as you can. Take a look at JTR&rsquo;s post to see one of those workflows.
