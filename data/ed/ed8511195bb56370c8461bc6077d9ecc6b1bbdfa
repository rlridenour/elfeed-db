As I&rsquo;ve said <i>many</i> times before, I&rsquo;m a <i>big</i> fan of Emacs Calc. Try as I might, I haven&rsquo;t been able to master Calc in its entirety. That&rsquo;s mostly because it has many advanced features that I seldom or never have the need to use.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, there are a lot of features that I <i>do</i> use. As long as I&rsquo;m on my laptop, Calc is the only calculator that I use. I can&rsquo;t remember ever having a calculation, no matter how esoteric, that it couldn&rsquo;t make. I use it enough that I have it bound to <kbd>F10</kbd> in Emacs.

Thomas Ingram has done me one better. He&rsquo;s <a href="https://taingram.org/blog/emacs-calc-desktop-entry.html">arranged to make Calc a desktop app</a> by having his computer call Calc from anywhere. He does this on Linux by adding a  <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry/latest/">Desktop file</a> that points at Emacs with an <code>--eval</code> command line option asking it to run <code>full-calc</code>. He has a version for those who—inexplicably—don&rsquo;t run Emacs in server or demon mode and one for those who do.
</p>
<p>
Living in the Apple ecosystem, as I do, the Desktop file option isn&rsquo;t open to me but I could do the same thing by using <a href="https://github.com/deseven/icanhazshortcut">iCanHazShortcut</a> that I use for macOS keyboard macros. Doubtless there are plenty of other ways. Regardless, in either ecosystem or probably any modern OS it&rsquo;s possible to call Emacs and ask it to run calc.
</p>
<p>
I <i>always</i> have Emacs running so I probably won&rsquo;t implement Ingram&rsquo;s solution unless I find myself often needing Calc when I&rsquo;m not inside Emacs. As I said, it would be easy to add it to my <code>iCanHazShortcut</code> app if I do. If you don&rsquo;t spend most of your time in Emacs, as I do, Ingram&rsquo;s solution may be just what you need to keep Calc at your fingertips.</p>
