<p>Stephen Hackett <a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/07/ten-years-indie/">celebrated the 10th anniversary of quitting his job</a> and going out on his own:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Merri and I had little kids when I went out on my own; our youngest son was born a month after Relay launched…. Today, we’ve got two teenagers and a 5th grader. I’ve been able to attend more school programs, go to more doctor appointments, and be present for more everyday moments than would have been possible had I stayed in a traditional job. Those things add up to something special. To be clear, I have prioritized work over family life way too many times over the last decade, just like other parents, but I like to think that when my kids reflect on their upbringing, memories of Merri and me both being present will be at the forefront of their minds.

<p>If you’re just a fan of Relay, you may not realize that Stephen has made some very serious changes to his “one job” over the years—most independent creators don’t have a single job that brings in enough income, so we end up working <a href="https://www.relay.fm/focused/203">five or six different ones</a> instead—most notably becoming the co-host of <a href="https://relay.fm/mpu">Mac Power Users</a> and working with David Smith on his <a href="https://www.crossforward.com">stable of apps</a>.</p>
<p>Back in my days at IDG, your tenth anniversary got a <a href="https://x.com/pathere/status/26399912704">dinner with the Chairman</a> and a fancy pen set. Being an indie gets you <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/09/ten/">moments of reflection about your life</a>, some congratulations from friends (Congratulations, Stephen!), and a hearty pat on the back—if you’re flexible enough to reach.</p>
