<p>David Remnick, in a fine short piece for The New Yorker on Signalgate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is an Administration that does not have to slip on a Signal
banana peel to reveal its deepest-held prejudices and its painful
incapacities. You get the sense that we would learn little if we
were privy to a twenty-four-hour-a-day live stream of its every
private utterance. Part of what was so appalling about Trump and
Vance’s recent meeting with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> was not
just their penchant for channelling the world view and negotiating
points of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> but their comfort in expressing
them, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/newsletter/the-daily/trump-and-zelenskys-stunning-fight"><em>barking</em> them</a>, at the Ukrainian President in front
of reporters in the Oval Office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stupidity and ignorance as a governing style. That’s it. They are <em>exactly</em> who they claim they are, and in private speak how they do in public. There is no secret plan.</p>

<p>These idiots do not believe polluting the atmosphere with carbon emissions has caused calamitous damage to our climate, despite the fact that experts, decades ago, almost universally predicted it would. Few issues in science had as much expert consensus.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/03/thompson-no-vaxxers">These idiots think vaccines</a> — one of the great breakthroughs in the history of science and medicine — are a bigger health risk than the diseases they immunize against. Now there are unvaccinated American kids dying from measles, a disease that was effectively wiped out in the modern world by the time I was born.</p>

<p>These idiots think the universe is only 6,000 years old.</p>

<p>Now they’re bringing the same sort of idiocy, unbound by critical thinking, history, or anything recognized as economic expertise, to trade policy.</p>
