<p>Fun episode of Tested with Adam Savage and Norman Chan. The first segment goes deep on what’s new in VisionOS 26. Apple is ignoring the jokes about the platform’s relative obscurity and has obviously been heads-down on building the platform out and up. VisionOS 26 is a <em>huge</em> year-over-year upgrade. Tons of exciting stuff, and so many little things are so much better.</p>

<p>The second segment of the show features cohost Norm Chan going backstage at The Talk Show Live From WWDC on Tuesday night, to speak with Adam Lisagor about the production details of the live immersive broadcast in Theater.</p>

<p>(The YouTube version of the show is in editing now — we’ll post it as soon as it’s ready. <s>But the immersive version in Theater is available for purchase now.</s> Whoops, my bad. The immersive version, which looks significantly better than the livestream — which looked pretty good! — will be available for purchase in <a href="https://theater.sandwich.vision/">Theater</a> a few days after the 2D version hits YouTube.)</p>
