2026's Super Bowl has the New England Patriots facing the Seattle Seahawks at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, with the kickoff time scheduled for <strong>3:30 p.m. Pacific Time / 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time</strong>.

<br/>
The big game is airing on NBC and streaming on Peacock Premium today.<br/>
