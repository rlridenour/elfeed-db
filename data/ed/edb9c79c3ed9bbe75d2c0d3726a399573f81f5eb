We have two cases of mangoes on our kitchen
counter: the last case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataulfo_(mango)">Ataulfo mangoes</a> W- could
find at the Nations supermarket a short bike-ride
away from the house (slightly underripe at
purchase; it's been a few days, so now A+ says
they're perfect), and a case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Atkins_(mango)">Tommy Atkins</a>
mangoes that are greener and tougher. He had meant
to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haden_(mango)">Hadens</a>, but accidentally picked the Tommys
up instead. That's okay, I said. I can turn them
into mango shakes.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Atkins_(mango)">Wikipedia</a> describes the Tommys as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Although generally not considered to be the best
in terms of sweetness and flavor, it is valued for
its very long shelf life and tolerance of handling
and transportation with little or no bruising or
degradation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Thomas Atkins submitted the fruit to the variety
committee of the Florida Mango Forum multiple
times during the 1950s, which rejected it due to
its unremarkable eating qualities and considerable
fiber in the flesh.
</p>

A+ has definitely developed mango preferences.
Like me, she likes the smooth, sweet creaminess of
Ataulfo and other Philippine-type mangoes. She's
the one who regularly checks the mangoes for
ripeness and reports on their status, letting us
know as soon as they're soft. After a good meal,
she often prepares a mango for herself, using a
paring knife to skim it close to the seed.
Sometimes she cuts a criss-cross grid and flips it
into a turtle, or scoops out the insides for
chopstick practice. She's gotten much better at
getting most of the mango out; there's usually
very little for me to scrape off the rest of the
skins. Without prompting, she remembers to wash
her hands before and after. One evening, watching
her deftly cut her mango, I said, "People pay good
money to send kids to cooking classes so they can
pick up knife skills. Could buy a lot of mangoes
for that money." We had fun joking about the
short-term and long-term benefits.
</p>

<p>
I grew up eating mangoes in the Philippines.
Sometimes they were on the breakfast table.
Sometimes I had them at <i>merienda</i> (afternoon
snack). Mangoes were either yellow, kidney-shaped,
soft, and sweet, or the tart green mangoes that
were also delicious in a different way, either
straight-up or with salt or with <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagoong">bagoong</a></i>
(fermented fish or shrimp paste). (It took me a
while to appreciate bagoong, but eventually I got
the hang of it.) Green mango shakes were also a
treat.

<p>
After I moved to Canada in 2005, I went a long
time without regularly buying mangoes. Still
mentally converting costs to Philippine pesos, I
balked at the expense of individual mangoes. The
supermarket rarely sold good-looking Ataulfo
mangoes, mostly just other mango cultivars that
were more fibrous. If they did have the yellow
kidney-shaped mangoes of my memory, the ones sold
individually tended to be wrinkly and sad. A case
of mangoes felt like overkill for just me, and I
never quite got around to seeing if any of my
friends wanted to, I don't know, rotate mango
buying.
</p>

<p>
I think we only started buying cases of mangoes
last year or the year before that. Now we're more
comfortable knowing that even if we buy cases one
after the other, we'll eat them before they go
bad. We'll never say, "I'm all mangoed out." (And
if we ever do get to that point, I can just
dehydrate whichever mangoes are left.) It is
definitely a frill and we're lucky to be able to
enjoy them.

When it's warm enough for the kids to complain of
the heat, we tend to ramp up our mango consumption
even more. For the past two years, I've been
bringing a cooler of frozen treats to A+'s park
playdates. It started as a way to fend off
temptation from the ice cream trucks that like to
prowl around parks, and as a reaction to the
ridiculousness of retail/wholesale pricing when it
comes to summer refreshments. My days in A+'s
sphere of friends are numbered, so I may as well
make the most of it. It's a splurge, but
time-limited. She will probably not invite me to
lurk in the background with a cooler of popsicles
when she's 18 years old. So yes to all the things,
for now: home-made mango freezies; strawberries
and peaches from the farmers market when they're
in season; freezies made from pick-your-own
strawberries when we make it out to a farm. (Child
labour!) Raspberry freezies are sometimes too
intense or too seedy for the kids. A+ is not a fan
of cantaloupe freezies, but I like them. For the
watermelon freezes, we're a bit divided. I like to
add a little bit of sugar to the watermelon if it
seems like it needs it. A+ takes pride in not
adding any sugar to home-made freezies, so
whenever she wants to be in charge of making them
(which is almost always), I let her go with
whatever she wants. She likes to use the
mini-watermelons and add a splash of lemon juice.
It always tastes refreshing.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we bring Chapman's ice lollies (the kids
prefer the single-flavour ones) or other
store-bought treats. Sometimes A+ proudly insists
on paying for these herself; early experiences of
<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=45753">prosocial spending</a>, hooray! When the fruits are in
season, I prefer to make home-made freezies. We
don't follow any recipes. We just prepare the
fruits and put them into the blender.

<p>
I use disposable popsicle bags from AliExpress
since I haven't found a local source I like, and
have determined that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Zipper seals are nice for filling, but difficult
to open. The best bags have a little notch for
tearing under the seal, but this is hard to see
in product photos. I often bring scissors if the
bags don't have notches.</li>
<li>22cm x 5cm: just right</li>
<li>28cm x 5.5cm: too much</li>
</ul>

<p>
We have a couple of reusable freezie molds that we
sometimes use. I save those for A+ and me because
I know they'll find their way back to the cooler.
</p>

<p>
I used to walk to the playdates with A+ in a
stroller (she still fits in the Thule Chariot
Cheetah XT, even at 9 years old), with the cooler
balanced on top of it. It took me 45 minutes to an
hour to walk to her usual park playdates, but the
freezies were fine if I packed the cooler with
lots of ice packs. With the <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2024/11/a-year-with-my-cargo-bike/">cargo bike</a>, I can get
to the playdates in 15 minutes or so, which means
there's plenty of time for A+ to play and get warm
before she decides it's time for a freezie break,
and the freezies are all still nicely cold.

<p>
A+'s favourite friends get first dibs by virtue of
proximity when she decides it's popsicle time
(after A+, of course, who gets first pick). It
feels quite satisfying when A+'s friends sidle up
and ask very politely if there happen to be any
more of those mango popsicles. Then we extend the
selection to everyone else in the playgroup, and
then, when everyone's sorted out, the occasional
brave soul who wanders up to the strange woman
handing frozen treats out to kids. I try to make
eye contact with their grown-up first to check if
it's okay. Sometimes when I'm distracted, I ask
the new kids if their grown-up is okay with it,
but I get the feeling that their quick nod might
not be entirely reliable as it tends to be done
with their eyes fixed on the prize. Gotta find
their actual grown-up. I know A+ likes to go back
for seconds or thirds on really hot days, so
sometimes I keep a special stash for her in a
nylon drawstring bag in the cooler. Sometimes I
have one too.

I'm Filipino. Part of my love language is food.
Taste can anchor memories, and I hope these are
part of her core experiences of childhood. I want
these to be part of my memories of her. That's
worth the mangoes.
