<p>In the latest twist in a fast-moving UK political scandal, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s director of communications, Tim Allan, resigned on Monday, a day after Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, stepped down. The exits follow fallout over Starmer’s decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as the UK’s ambassador to the United States, after newly released Epstein-related files renewed scrutiny of Mandelson’s past relationship with the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. McSweeney said he took “full responsibility” for urging Starmer to make the appointment and said it was wrong, as critics inside and outside Labour question the prime minister’s judgment and leadership. Allan said he was stepping down to make room for a “new No 10 team,” leaving Starmer once again searching for a communications lead at a time of weak polling and rising internal tension. Starmer is expected to face Labour MPs at a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting, with anger inside the party still running high over the Mandelson appointment.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/YFQPpiwx1DIWbqps9Amh-5QCn7Nw7kXQ66zZ3y6NLtfvxOPOOL8zz2n7s2qUSvj8_rqJhtUN5_VrKFUELyJINmW-k4Pay4wcJQ-hPLvdoPcY1UmmosbLDYY6yyFAA-zq7nDZezwcH7Y5-w2mM_6QwNLHdHyRX2rvgPO_rFRCMFONiO7dUtsyRQmKqZUQmwEYCs9HNtOR' alt='Morgan McSweeney in December.
