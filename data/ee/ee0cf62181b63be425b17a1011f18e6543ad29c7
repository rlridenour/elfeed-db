<p>Rumors are swirling about a redesigned MacBook Pro slated for release next year, featuring the M6 chip, a thinner chassis — and most notably — an OLED display. A recent <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/30/redesigned-macbook-pro-2026-upgrades/">9to5Mac article</a> summarizes the rumors.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m particularly excited about the prospect of an OLED screen. This technology promises higher brightness, improved contrast ratios, and more vibrant colors, making the types of things folks do on a MacBook Pro even easier.</p>



<p>However, the notion of a thinner design makes me nervous. In my experience, when surveying the needs of MacBook Pro users — especially those in same creative professions — the desire for a slimmer profile rarely tops the list. More commonly, folks want better battery life, enhanced performance, and adequate input/output.</p>



<p>Apple has a history of pursuing thinner designs, sometimes at the expense of functionality.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-in/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks">The butterfly keyboard</a>&nbsp;is the most recent example. If “thinner” is on that whiteboard in Cupertino, I hope Apple doesn’t compromise the performance and reliability that MacBook Pro users depend on. Perhaps advancements in chip design will allow for a thinner MacBook Pro without sacrificing battery life or power. But even if that is true, I’d argue the MacBook Pro still doesn’t need to get thinner. I’d fill that empty space with more battery and a better cooling system to let the new MacBook Pro run even harder.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we can anticipate the release of the M5 MacBook Pro later this year, likely in the fall as the last MacBook Pro with this current, much-loved, design.</p>
