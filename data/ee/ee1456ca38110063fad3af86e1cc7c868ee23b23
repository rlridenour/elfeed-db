<p>On social media, the Talking Heads <a href="https://fb.watch/A2eyMsGNea/">teased</a> a major announcement on June 5th, leading fans to wonder if a reunion—41 years after their last tour—might finally be in the offing. As one fan put it, “If this is a tour announcement, I am going to freak out!” Alas, we didn’t quite get that. (Maybe next time!) Instead, we got the first official music video for “Psycho Killer.” Directed by Mike Mills and starring Saoirse Ronan, the video helps commemorate <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2012/08/the_talking_heads_play_cbgb_1975.html">the band’s first show at CBGB 50 years ago</a>.
