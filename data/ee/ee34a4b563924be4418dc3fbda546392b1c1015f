Many automakers have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/30/carplay-ultra-automaker-comments/">tight-lipped about adopting CarPlay Ultra</a>, so Polestar confirming that it still plans to offer the software system is notable.<br/>
<br/>
CarPlay Ultra is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/first-look-at-carplay-ultra/">limited to luxury Aston Martin vehicles</a> in the U.S. and Canada. Apple said that many other automakers around the world are working to offer it over the next year and beyond, including Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis. <br/>

Polestar was one of more than a dozen automakers that Apple had listed as being committed to offering the next generation of CarPlay, now known as CarPlay Ultra, when it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">first announced in 2022</a>. Given the list is now three years old, however, it is possible that some automakers have shifted gears. For example, Mercedes-Benz was included in the list, but it has since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144356/mercedes-benz-ceo-apple-carplay-next-gen-decoder">decided not to</a> let Apple take over its in-vehicle software experience.<br/>
<br/>
That original list from 2022 was as follows:<ul><li>Acura</li><br/>
<li>Audi</li><br/>
<li>Ford</li><br/>
<li>Honda</li><br/>
<li>Infiniti</li><br/>
<li>Jaguar</li><br/>
<li>Land Rover</li><br/>
<li>Lincoln</li><br/>
<li>Mercedes-Benz</li><br/>
<li>Nissan</li><br/>
<li>Polestar</li><br/>
<li>Porsche</li><br/>
<li>Renault</li><br/>
<li>Volvo</li></ul>Aston Martin was announced later.<br/>
