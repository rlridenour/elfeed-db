Addy Osmani has been working at Google for about 14 years. During that time, he&rsquo;s learned a few—basically non-technical—lessons about life as a software engineer. His post, <a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/21-lessons/">21 Lessons From 14 Years at Google</a>, lists some of the things he learned along with a bit of commentary about each one.

There&rsquo;s probably not anything in the list that will surprise you but it&rsquo;s instructive to see them written down. My favorite is the (slightly) ironic &ldquo;Abstractions don’t remove complexity. They move it to the day you’re on call.&rdquo; If the meaning of that isn&rsquo;t clear to you, take a look his accompanying commentary.

It&rsquo;s a nice list and worth taking a look at. It&rsquo;s a fairly short read so it won&rsquo;t take you long.</p>
