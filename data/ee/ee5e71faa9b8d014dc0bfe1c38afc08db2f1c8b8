Apple's latest original film, "F1: The Movie," has become the company's highest-grossing theatrical release to date, earning over &#36;293 million globally within ten days of release, <em><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/f1-movie-apple-highest-grossing-film-napoleon-1236448149/">Variety</a></em> reports.<br/>

According to <em>Variety</em>, the film earned &#36;146 million globally during its opening weekend and has since surpassed &#36;293 million worldwide, overtaking Ridley Scott's "Napoleon" (&#36;221 million) and Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon" (&#36;158 million) as Apple's highest box office performer to date. Two of Apple's movies, "Fly Me to the Moon" (&#36;42 million) and "Argylle" (&#36;96 million), severely underperformed.<br/>
<br/>
IMAX screenings have been a significant contributor to revenue, accounting for &#36;60 million globally, or roughly 20% of total ticket sales. Outside of the United States and Canada, where F1 has grossed &#36;109.5 million to date, the top-performing international markets include China (&#36;22 million), the United Kingdom (&#36;17.3 million), Mexico (&#36;12.3 million), France (&#36;11.5 million), and Australia (&#36;9.8 million).<br/>
<br/>
The production cost for F1 is estimated to have exceeded &#36;250 million, with marketing expenses reportedly adding another &#36;100 million. While the film's box office performance has exceeded that of Apple's previous theatrical titles, the total gross remains below the estimated break-even threshold for a film with such a high combined budget. Box office returns are also typically split between studios and exhibitors, with studios often receiving around 50% of domestic ticket revenue and a smaller share internationally. As a result, it is unlikely that F1 has yet recouped its full investment from theatrical ticket sales alone.<br/>

Following its run in theaters, F1 is expected to become available on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ later in 2025. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/variety-com/">Variety</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/06/gamble-on-f1-starting-to-pay-off/">Apple&#039;s &#36;350 Million Gamble on &#039;F1&#039; Is Starting to Pay Off</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-350-million-gamble-on-f1-is-starting-to-pay-off.2461071/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
