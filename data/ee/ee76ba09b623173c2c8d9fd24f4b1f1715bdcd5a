AT&T today launched <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2025/att-stands-up-for-consumers.html">a new ad campaign</a> that goes after T-Mobile, calling out the "litany of misleading and deceiving claims in T-Mobile's marketing."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Ain't Our First Rodeo ft Luke Wilson AT&T" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EHkISq0p9Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>AT&T's new ad features actor Luke Wilson, with Wilson calling T-Mobile the "master of breaking promises." AT&T points out that the BBB's National Advertising Review Board has recommended T-Mobile change its advertising 16 times over the past four years, though AT&T fails to mention that the NARB also found that some claims were accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile often ask the National Advertising Review Board to <a href="https://bbbprograms.org/search?searchTerm=t-mobile&sortresultsby=most-relevant&page=0">investigate the advertising claims</a> that their competitors are making, and all three carriers are regularly asked to make various changes as a result.<br/>
<br/>
AT&T says that it covers 300,000 more square miles than T-Mobile, and that it had the fewest dropped calls in recent tests. AT&T claims that it is the first and only network to offer a guarantee for its wireless and fiber networks, providing "transparent communication" and proactive bill credits during outages.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/att/">AT&amp;T</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/">T-Mobile</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/23/att-t-mobile-ads/">AT&amp;T Targets T-Mobile in New Ad Campaign</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/at-t-targets-t-mobile-in-new-ad-campaign.2469703/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
