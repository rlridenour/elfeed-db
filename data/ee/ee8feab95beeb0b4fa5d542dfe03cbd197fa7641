<a href="https://www.anker.com/anker-prime">The Prime line</a> includes Anker's first charger with a 300W maximum output that can power three devices simultaneously, including two laptops and a smartphone. The 26,250mAh Prime 300W Power Bank can recharge at up to 250W with two separate 140W USB-C cables and power adapters, or with a 150W charging base.<br/>

According to Anker, its new Prime Charger is the "world's most compact 160W multi-port charger." It can charge a laptop, tablet, and phone at the same time, splitting the 160W across three USB-C ports.<br/>

Under <a href="https://www.eufy.com">the Eufy Brand</a>, Anker announced the Robot Vacuum Omni S2 and the Marswalker, a stair-climbing carrier that allows robot vacuums like the Omni S2 to climb stairs. The Omni S2 has an AeroTurbo deep cleaning system to remove dirt, pet hair, and debris from carpets and rugs, and there is a HydroJet 2.0 system with constant downward pressure and a self-cleaning pad for mopping hard floors. The new robot technology will launch in late 2025 in Europe, and will expand to the rest of the world in January 2026.<br/>
