<p>Jason Snell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the ads played on, I began creating a thought experiment: There’s a $10 difference between the ad and ad-free plans. If Mr. Netflix (he wears a top hat) came to my house and said, “Jason, I’ve got a great deal for you. I’m going to pay you $120 a year, and all you have to do is watch ads while you watch Netflix,” what would I do? When I started thinking about it, I thought it might be an interesting intellectual question. What <em>would</em> I accept in exchange for having Mean Mr. Netflix beam ads into every show I watch?</p>
