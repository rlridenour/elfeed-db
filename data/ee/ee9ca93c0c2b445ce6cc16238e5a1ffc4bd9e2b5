<p>The FBI has requested voluntary interviews with six Democratic members of the US Congress who appeared in a video telling US service members they can and must refuse unlawful commands, according to a US Justice Department official and multiple media reports. The lawmakers framed their message as a reminder that troops are bound by US and international law rather than any individual leader, after public debate over the legality of potential future orders from President Trump related to military operations and domestic deployment. The Pentagon has separately warned that it may recall Senator Mark Kelly, a former US Navy captain and astronaut, to active duty to face possible military charges over what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called &quot;seditious&quot; conduct on social media linked to the video. The lawmakers and their allies argue that the FBI actions amount to intimidation for raising legal concerns and say they will cooperate while defending what they describe as lawful, duty-focused guidance to the armed forces.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Qefiq_rZtE_pxg5wHZpDKK_UwXN16hOcrGcLK7pJnxX1uz0-rnVuK0Uh_2s-itAzfrw9JfcHWCFlUo-74d1FfpeRxFi2c2a6yFKP8FDU_nk89SP-vXsFWbLUSxGI9m-pM99npd0ZRfPydLm2BjZpT6-AsXmcS_GzWrzjUlYfbr87fnyK1b-Cca0_gmXZ3IeJsMSv2qjg5SeoSvdDWlvi1hC52f5x6pveIKOPYKXv8IMaoWDbZOzUtdvOJ6unJNbBwUR1Ng' alt='US Senator and former Navy officer Mark Kelly, one of the lawmakers featured in the video about unlawful orders.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Who is involved: Six Democrats in Congress, including Arizona Senator and Navy veteran Mark Kelly, appeared in the video reminding military personnel about their obligation to refuse illegal commands, prompting the FBI’s interview requests.</li><li>Possible military recall: The Pentagon has indicated it could use its authority to bring Senator Kelly back onto active duty status so that he could face potential charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice over his participation in the message.</li><li>Legal framing: The video emphasizes that US troops are required under both US military law and international law to disobey orders they reasonably believe to be unlawful, a principle long taught in military ethics and training.</li><li>Lawmakers’ response: The targeted Democrats have described the FBI outreach as an attempt at &quot;intimidation&quot; and &quot;harassment&quot; but say their goal was to prevent war crimes and uphold constitutional limits on presidential power.</li><li>Public political dispute: President Trump has publicly attacked the six lawmakers over the video and has endorsed severe punishment for them, escalating the confrontation between the White House, parts of Congress, and the military over the boundaries of lawful orders.</li></ul><blockquote>The FBI has requested interviews with six Democrats from the U.S. Congress who told members of the military they must refuse any illegal orders - Unnamed Justice Department official (as reported)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Democratic lawmakers in the video: They argue their statement simply reminded troops of longstanding legal duties to reject unlawful instructions and accuse federal authorities of trying to silence concerns about potential abuses of power.
