providing it in response to requests for functionality that
streamlines the work of merging contents from one file into another.
Thanks to Sia Piperea for reminding me about it, making a suggestion
for region-related functions, and for testing my prototype:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-org/issues/16">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-org/issues/16</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/649">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/649</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-merge/issues/1">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-merge/issues/1</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-merge</code> package is a more refined implementation of those
ideas, plus more. As of now, the package provides support for two
broad kinds of “merging”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Merge one file into another.</li>
  <li>Merge a region into a file.</li>
</ul>

<p>For merging a region, in particular, there are options and concomitant
convenience commands to format the region in a certain way, such as an
Org source block, a Markdown blockquote, a plain indented region, and
the like.</p>

<p>The official manual describes the technicalities. In short, I have
taken care to make the relevant commands do the right thing, including
to update backlinks, annotate the contents, and establish links, where
relevant.</p>

<p>Note that the GNU ELPA package is not available yet. I have prepared
the relevant patch and am expecting everything to be done in the near
future.</p>

<p>Please stay tuned.</p>
