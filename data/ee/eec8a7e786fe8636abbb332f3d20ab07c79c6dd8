  The event, which has not been promoted or advertised, is taking place in the White House on Saturday. Guests include director <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/brett-ratner/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brett Ratner</a>; Queen Rania of Jordan; Zoom CEO Eric Yuan; Apple CEO Tim Cook; New York Stock Exchange CEO Lynn Martin; AMD CEO Lisa Su; Mike Tyson; socialite and Fiat heiress Azzi Agnelli; self-help guru Tony Robbins; and photographer Ellen von Unwerth, who shot the movie poster for the film.

<p id="p3">Earlier that day, a Minneapolis man was shot and killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/24/us/minneapolis-shooting-alex-pretti-timeline.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">by federal agents</a>. I’d like to think that in the face of such a tragedy the screening would have been called off or that attendees, including Cook, would have been no-shows, but <a href="https://x.com/MarlowNYC/status/2015857140343128423" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Rolling Stone editor Marlow Stern</a>, Cook and others did attend.</p>
