<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/apple-ipad-macbook-oled-displays/">iPad mini</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/macbook-pro-oled-touch-screen/">and MacBook Pro</a> will receive an OLED display as early as this year, but he does not expect the MacBook Air to adopt the technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/apple-ipad-macbook-oled-displays/">until 2028 at the earliest</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A new iPad Air is expected to be released this year, but Gurman said it will have an LCD display. He <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/apple-ipad-macbook-oled-displays/">expects a subsequent iPad Air model to have an OLED display</a>, suggesting that the device will not adopt the technology until at least 2027.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, the South Korean publication <em>The Elec</em> reported that Apple is planning to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/18/apple-developing-24-inch-oled-imac/">24-inch iMac with an OLED display</a> in 2027 or 2028.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, here is when each device is expected to get an OLED display:<ul><li><strong>iPad mini</strong>: 2026</li><br/>
  <li><strong>MacBook Pro</strong>: Late 2026 or 2027</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPad Air</strong>: 2027</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iMac</strong>: 2027 or 2028</li><br/>
  <li><strong>MacBook Air</strong>: 2028</li></ul>OLED displays have better overall image quality compared to LCD displays, thanks to richer colors and higher contrast ratio with true blacks.<br/>
<br/>
All of the new iPhone, Apple Watch, and iPad Pro models that Apple sells today already have OLED displays, while the Apple Vision Pro has micro-OLED displays.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/16/next-5-apple-products-with-oled-displays/">These 5 Apple Products Will Reportedly Be Upgraded With OLED Displays</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-5-apple-products-will-reportedly-be-upgraded-with-oled-displays.2476163/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
