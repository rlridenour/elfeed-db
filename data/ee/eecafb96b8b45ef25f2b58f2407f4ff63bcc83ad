The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> will be available for pre-order in China this Friday, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> today <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/u/5524254784?luicode=10000011&lfid=1005051834280165&featurecode=sinanews20170424">said on Weibo</a> during a visit to the country.<br/>

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/12/apple-delays-iphone-air-launch-china-e-sim/">initially postponed</a> the release of the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; in China while it worked with mainland authorities to resolve regulatory issues related to the device's eSIM requirement. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max already went on sale with the global launch as normal.<br/>
<br/>
At 5.6mm thick, the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; does not have a physical SIM slot, and is limited to eSIM-only operation. That's a problem in China, since carriers have not traditionally supported eSIM for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> even though it's widely used around the world. Apple has said that all three state-owned telecommunications network operators – China Unicom, China Mobile and China Telecom – will "provide eSIM support [with] specific timing subject to regulatory approval." <br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; starts from 7,999 yuan in China. Pre-orders will open on Friday, October 17, with launch on Wednesday, October 22. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-Air">iPhone Air (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/13/iphone-air-to-launch-in-china-this-week/">iPhone Air to Launch in China This Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-to-launch-in-china-this-week.2469024/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
