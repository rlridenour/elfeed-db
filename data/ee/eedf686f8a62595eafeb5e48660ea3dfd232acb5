<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>I sometimes work with long functions or big org subtrees and it&rsquo;s not always clear
what function or org subtree I&rsquo;m in right now.
I wish there is a package that can show me what function I&rsquo;m in.</p>

<p>Turns out Emacs has this mode built-in so this functionality is just <code>M-x which-function-mode</code> away.
It shows in the status line a function name I&rsquo;m currently in (see <code>[encode_terminal_code]</code> on the screenshot above).
It&rsquo;s global mode so as soon as it&rsquo;s enabled, you&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s working for every buffer.
You can have it enabled on Emacs startup by adding <code>(which-function-mode)</code> to your config file.

I just started to get benefits of this mode but it&rsquo;s already surprising how well it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>it works in various prog modes</li>
<li>it works in org mode</li>
<li>it even works in markdown files</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to work in html files I tried it with or modes that use html (e.g. vuejs or laravel blade files).
<br>It definitely not an issue for me so I&rsquo;m going to continue using it and <strong>I suggest you to try it out</strong>.</p>
