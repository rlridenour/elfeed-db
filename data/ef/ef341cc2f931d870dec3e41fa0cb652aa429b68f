<p>
Last week I came into a problem with Git, that I can&#39;t fetch the remote branch that I just pushed to. It was so weird because I can push it. It never happens before, and it happened when I was in a rush to rebase my code, as someone in my team pushed his code.</p>

After searching, it seemed that the configuration of <code class="verbatim">fetch</code> of that repo was different(this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11623862/fetch-in-git-doesnt-get-all-branches">Stack Overflow</a> thread for example) than before, it was specified that only <code class="verbatim">master</code> can be fetched. It worked after I changed it to <code class="verbatim">+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</code>.</p>
