<p>OpenAI:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can now ask ChatGPT to handle requests like “look at my
calendar and brief me on upcoming client meetings based on recent
news,” “plan and buy ingredients to make Japanese breakfast for
four,” and “analyze three competitors and create a slide deck.”
ChatGPT will intelligently navigate websites, filter results,
prompt you to log in securely when needed, run code, conduct
analysis, and even deliver editable slideshows and spreadsheets
that summarize its findings.</p>

<p>At the core of this new capability is a unified agentic system. It
brings together three strengths of earlier breakthroughs:
<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/"><em>Operator’s</em> </a> ability to interact with websites, <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/"><em>deep
research’s</em> </a> skill in synthesizing information, and ChatGPT’s
intelligence and conversational fluency.</p>

<p>ChatGPT carries out these tasks using its own virtual computer,
fluidly shifting between reasoning and action to handle complex
workflows from start to finish, all based on your instructions.</p>
