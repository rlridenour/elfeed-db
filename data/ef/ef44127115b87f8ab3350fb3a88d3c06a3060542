<p>For some time we&#8217;ve been hearing rumors of the M6 MacBook Pro due to be released late next year or early 2027. Note this is not the incoming M5 MacBook Pros expected in soon or early next year (depending on which rumor you believe), but instead the M6 MacBook Pro that comes after that.</p>



<p>This would be the first redesign of the MacBook Pro since Apple switched over to Apple Silicon. I think most folks are pretty happy with the current design of the MacBook Pro, but this sounds like it&#8217;s really taking it up a notch. The rumors are that it has an OLED screen and possibly even a touchscreen. The notch is supposed to go away. It may be getting Apple’s new cellular chip, making it the first Mac with onboard cellular, and the whole thing is supposed to be driven by the M6 2nm chip.</p>



<p>The rumor that the redesign will also make it thinner and lighter has folks nervous, but I think Apple learned its lesson with the butterfly keyboard. If it becomes thinner and lighter, I expect Apple to avoid any unforced errors.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure Apple is perturbed by all these rumors, given that the M5 MacBook Pro hasn&#8217;t even been released yet. Regardless, I think many potential buyers will be tempted to wait for M6.</p>
