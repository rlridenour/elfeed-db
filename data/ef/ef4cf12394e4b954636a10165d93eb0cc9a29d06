    After all the fun I had this summer at the Open Source Bridge giving
    my talks on both Lisp/Clojure and Emacs, I figured that I would
    upload them to YouTube:
    </p>

    <ul class="org-ul">
    <li><a href="http://youtu.be/3T00X_sNg4Q">Learn you Some Lisp</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DB6jfrrwR10k">Introduction to Emacs</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dkt-wLpz-9PA">Emacs transpose-words and defadvice</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Just noticed that the audio to my talk, <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/964">Literate Programming</a> now has
    the <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/osbridge/audio/2013/June%2B18/B202-203/06_Literate%2BProgramming%2Bfor%2Bthe%2B21st%2BCentury_Howard%2BAbrams.mp3">audio online</a>, however, without the Emacs demonstration of
    <a href="http://orgmode.org">org-mode</a>, I wonder how helpful it would be.
