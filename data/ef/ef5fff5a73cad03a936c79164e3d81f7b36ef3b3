<p>Turkey will host the UN COP31 climate summit in November 2026 in Antalya after a compromise with Australia that hands Canberra the role of leading the conference&#x27;s formal government negotiations and staging pre-meetings in the Pacific; the arrangement resolves a stand-off that began after both countries bid in 2022. Australian leaders framed the split as a pragmatic compromise that preserves Australia’s negotiating influence, while Pacific governments have voiced disappointment that co-hosting ambitions were curtailed. The deal must still be finalised, and organisers have about a year to prepare for an event that typically attracts tens of thousands and requires months of diplomatic work to reach agreement.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/W2azl0KYG_DawsS4yf-pvFsw0mb1hpYz_Bshpj_pXkCR6hDZJCW21urE0al1jmGaPNYtQFHQoz7WCAgSTVV0p7UFEMyAz6xGeKwFCYNzbDqu1AsIqvxzqI-Iiq73m1IzPOqggxQmlnr0k-YeB0BjEKHEtl20ODMxhYy2qL8GI7Q6IFuUSSDUaTcoNo93v2aPTLRbpiYWghiE0HNRJR1uTjr8JZ_JyD06UJjM-Yz52CdM6DNEd_BEyhg92g' alt='Chris Bowen speaking from the sidelines of COP30 as he confirmed Australia would withdraw its bid to host COP31' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Pacific disappointment: Papua New Guinea’s foreign minister said Canberra’s withdrawal left Pacific partners “not happy” and disappointed, signalling strained regional trust after Australia abandoned its co-host bid</li><li>Australia&#x27;s pitch: Australia had promoted a “Pacific COP” approach that emphasised low-lying island nations’ vulnerability and had spent A$7 million preparing its bid and partnership platform before yielding hosting rights</li><li>Selection mechanics: Under UN practice, hosting rights were settled by negotiation and consensus after a protracted stand-off in which neither country initially agreed to stand down following their 2022 bids</li><li>Political cost: Australian commentators and outlets say the late concession is likely to be politically sensitive for Canberra after years of campaigning and public spending on the Adelaide bid, which some reports say consumed significant government effort and funds</li></ul><blockquote>What we&#x27;ve come up with is a big win for both Australia and Turkey - Anthony Albanese</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Australian prime minister (Anthony Albanese): Albanese described the compromise as &quot;a big win for both Australia and Turkey,&quot; framing it as a way to secure Australia&#x27;s negotiating influence while resolving the impasse.
