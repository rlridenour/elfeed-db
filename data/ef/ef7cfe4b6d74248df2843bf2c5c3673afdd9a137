<p>I <a href="https://taonaw.com/2025/10/15/microblog-added-movies-and-shows.html">mentioned</a> that micro.blog now connects with movies and shows directly, so it&rsquo;s even more convenient to write quick thoughts about a movie I watched. I don&rsquo;t always want to commit to a whole review, and many times I don&rsquo;t add something right away because I need to make the time to write a full review on Letterbox for it to show on my blog; now, this friction point is gone, and I can even add shows that I watch, which is a welcome addition. I watch more shows and often have more thoughts about an episode I watched than I do about movies.</p>
<p>This led me to think about centralizing again. I <em>like</em> that I can save everything on my blog for two reasons: first, it&rsquo;s one place for everything; I don&rsquo;t need to have an app for movies and a separate place for photos, and then also have my blog. It&rsquo;s all here. It&rsquo;s all accessible. This, of course, leads to the &ldquo;all eggs in one basket&rdquo; problem, which is why I make frequent updates of my blog (posts and uploads) just in case. Micro.blog is very convenient to export from, which is a critical requirement for me.</p>
<p>Still, I worry. I worry that Micro.blog will go away one day, and then I will have to find a range of separate solutions again. I worry I will need to re-invent my workflow, which I do quickly from muscle memory now.</p>
<p>The web in general and tech today are mostly built into silos. If I want to talk to more people about Emacs and org-mode, I need to go to Reddit, which is locked away and regularly bans my alternative accounts because I use a VPN. This doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Reddit is a place I have to go to often to interact with people, because, well, that&rsquo;s where people go. Superuser forms and the like are a little better, but not by much. Discord is another platform that I don&rsquo;t like but have to put up with, because that&rsquo;s what the &ldquo;kids&rdquo; use today, and if I want support and a good community, then,  yes, some of those Discord &ldquo;servers&rdquo; (I hate that they use this term) are the place to go.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1044247-old-man-yells-at-cloud">an old man yelling at clouds</a>. I know that the people on Reddit or Discord or whatever don&rsquo;t know anything else and don&rsquo;t have even a sense of perspective of what privacy can mean, of what truly &ldquo;off the cloud&rdquo; can mean. It&rsquo;s a losing argument I&rsquo;m not willing to have anymore. I just nod quietly and say &ldquo;yeah, that&rsquo;s nice&rdquo; when someone mentions a new flashy app. And besides, as a person on macOS Tahoe, I am somewhat of a hypocrite myself. The only truly non-cloud app I use daily is Emacs, and even though Emacs works well on the Mac, it requires preparations and know-how that other people just don&rsquo;t know exists (try to explain Homebrew to a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; person, and why they might need it).</p>
<p>I like technology and new tools. There are many good, amazing things out there, and I would be a fool not to be aware of and not to use them out of sheer principle. I talked about photography last week and how I&rsquo;m leaving Photoshop behind (just look under the <a href="https://taonaw.com/archive/">Archive</a> section, too many posts to link directly to), and I&rsquo;m glad I can take photos with my phone and edit them to a satisfactory level there, without even firing up my Mac, for example. This means less friction, which means more photos, and that&rsquo;s part of the point.</p>
<p>Is there a point I&rsquo;m trying to get to&hellip;? No, not really. There&rsquo;s something cooking, but it&rsquo;s not ready yet. I think I&rsquo;m just setting the stage. We will see.</p>
