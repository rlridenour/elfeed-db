<p>To my American readers: Tomorrow, as you sit down for Thanksgiving dinner, you might find yourself across from someone with very different political views. Before the tension rises, consider this: there&#8217;s a decent chance that some of the most inflammatory political content you&#8217;ve both seen this year was created by someone in Bangladesh or Morocco, <a href="https://www.404media.co/americas-polarization-has-become-the-worlds-side-hustle/">turning American polarization into a literal side hustle</a>.</p>



<p>So we should stop letting folks halfway around the world profit from making us hate each other. Your uncle who votes differently from you? He&#8217;s not the enemy. He&#8217;s just on the other wing of the same bird. And last I checked, birds need both wings to fly.</p>



<p>So smile, pass the mashed potatoes, and remember: we&#8217;re all in this together.</p>
