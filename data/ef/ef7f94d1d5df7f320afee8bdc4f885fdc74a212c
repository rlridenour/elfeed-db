<p>Here’s the full statement, given by Apple to the media, including Daring Fireball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Today we filed our appeal because we believe the European
Commission’s decision — and their unprecedented fine — go far
beyond what the law requires. As our appeal will show, the EC is
mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which
are confusing for developers and bad for users. We implemented
this to avoid punitive daily fines and will share the facts with
the Court.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone — including, I believe, at Apple — agrees that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/apple_app_store_policy_updates_dma">the policy changes Apple announced at the end of June</a> are confusing and seemingly incomplete in terms of fee structures. What Apple is saying here in this statement is they needed to launch these policy changes now, before the full fee implications are worked out, to avoid the daily fines they were set to be penalized with for the steering rules.</p>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/07/apple-formally-appeals-e500-million-dma-fine-in-the-eu/">Chance Miller, reporting for 9to5Mac</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple also reiterates that the EU has continuously redefined what
exactly it needs to do under the DMA. In particular, Apple says
the European Commission has expanded the definition of steering.
Apple adjusted its guidelines to allow EU developers to link out
to external payment methods and use alternative in-app payment
methods last year. Now, however, Apple says the EU has redefined
steering to include promotions of in-app alternative payment
options and in-app webviews, as well as linking to other
alternative app marketplaces and the third-party apps distributed
through those marketplaces.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Apple says that the EU mandated that the Store
Services Fee include multiple tiers. [...] You can view the full
breakdown of the two tiers <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/store-services-tiers/">on Apple’s developer website</a>.
Apple says that it was the EU who dictated which features should
be included in which tier. For example, the EU mandated that Apple
move app discovery features to the second tier.</p>
