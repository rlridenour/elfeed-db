Apple's next-generation AirPods Pro will feature cameras to see around a user, according to the leaker and prototype collector known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>."<br/>

In a <a href="https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/2020516239039246517?s=20">new post</a> on X, Kosutami said that the next AirPods Pro will be able to see around the wearer, presumably via cameras in each earbud. Supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that the 2026 AirPods Pro will feature a "more significant" hardware upgrade in the form at least one <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/apple-still-exploring-airpods-with-cameras/">tiny infrared camera</a>. He previously said AirPods with infrared cameras could recognize hand gestures and provide an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-airpods-to-feature-ir-cameras/">enhanced spatial audio experience</a> with Apple's Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
Kosutami added that the new AirPods Pro will be available at the same &#36;249 price as the current model. This contrasts with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/20/higher-end-airpods-pro-coming-this-year/">previous rumors</a> suggesting that the next AirPods Pro would be a secondary version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a> this year, sitting in the lineup alongside the current model.<br/>
<br/>
The Chinese leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/08/two-versions-of-airpods-pro-3-coming/">corroborated the rumors</a> about new AirPods Pro featuring infrared cameras for gesture controls, with some additional details and clarifications. Rather than being a new generation, the 2026 AirPods Pro will apparently be a pricier, high-end variant of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; introduced in 2025, suggesting that both models will ultimately be on sale alongside each other. It is worth noting that Apple offers two version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> at &#36;129 and &#36;179 price points, so this is a highly plausible move.<br/>
<br/>
The current AirPods lineup has offerings priced at &#36;129, &#36;179, &#36;249, and &#36;549. An additional product between the &#36;249 &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; and &#36;549 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> seems possible, especially given the rise of higher end Bluetooth earbuds from the likes of Bang Olufsen, Bowers & Wilkins, and Bose.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, back in September 2025, Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/07/airpods-pro-3-this-year-per-kuo/">reported</a> that Apple is planning to introduce a successor to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; in 2026. This would be somewhat unusual since Apple normally waits around three years to make major changes to the AirPods' hardware. AirPods Pro 2 debuted at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14 event in September 2022, and they were updated with a USB-C charging case and a few other tweaks in September 2023. Otherwise, Apple has waited about three years to update all of its AirPods models. <br/>
<br/>
Whether they are a new, high-end version of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; or full-fledged AirPods Pro 4, launch timing is currently unclear, but Apple typically announces new AirPods in the second half of the year. The original AirPods, AirPods Pro 2 and their subsequent USB-C revision, &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj;, and &zwnj;AirPods Pro 3&zwnj; were all announced at Apple's annual &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; event in September. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro 3</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/airpods-pro-4-could-feature-cameras-to-see-around-you/">AirPods Pro 4 Could Feature Cameras to &#039;See Around You&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-4-could-feature-cameras-to-see-around-you.2477403/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
