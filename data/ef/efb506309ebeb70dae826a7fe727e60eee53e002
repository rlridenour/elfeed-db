<blockquote>
  <p>Representative Kat Cammack (R-FL) introduced a bill Tuesday that
would require “large app store operators” like Apple to let users
install third-party app stores and set them as their default. The
bill, called <a href="https://cammack.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/cammack.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/app-store-freedom-119.pdf">the App Store Freedom Act</a>, aims to “promote
competition and protect consumers and developers in the mobile
app marketplace,” according to a <a href="https://cammack.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-cammack-introduces-app-store-freedom-act-promote-competition-protect">press release on
Tuesday</a>. [...]</p>

<p>It would also require Apple and Google to offer developers “equal
access to interfaces, features, and development tools without cost
or discrimination,” as well as allow users to remove or hide
pre-installed apps. Violations of the bill would result in
penalties from the Federal Trade Commission, along with an
additional civil penalty of up to $1 million for each violation.</p>

<p>This is a stunt from the Epic/Spotify-backed <a href="https://appfairness.org/">Coalition for App Fairness</a> that we’ll probably never hear about again.</p>
