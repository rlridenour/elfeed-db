<p>Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country faces a choice between “losing dignity” or risking the loss of a key partner after the U.S. presented a 28‑point peace plan seen as favoring Russian demands; he vowed not to “betray” Ukraine’s interests and to work “calmly” with allies [ft.com#1][ndtv.com#1][pbs.org#1][aljazeera.com#1]. President Trump said next Thursday (Thanksgiving in the U.S.) is an “appropriate” deadline for Kyiv to accept the plan, while indicating deadlines can be extended if talks progress [scmp.com#1][time.com#1][politico.eu#1]. Several outlets published the full draft, which would require Kyiv to cede territory, cap its military at 600,000, and permanently forgo NATO membership—terms European leaders criticized as they rallied behind Zelensky after being excluded from the drafting [politico.eu#2][ft.com#2][aljazeera.com#3][nytimes.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wtJjnFtkmQ6mbSpWr5wkf5A9EuGJiv0bGHvmnoqDjCOvgJ7vzSd999Dw_eUemkx3RIWBaV3W7Wihkpwmsq_q3Z-RjjHnnjMOF7BW2s1XPbUJ2-BqdHMwdMrvC3VLAfS0ou-3NT1CDzhW12_10yD2Jc34TVX1iAA8YvNISBrCvgq_WY_KcOrwn56is5HuKYc1D64gOPs_nagIsjOAa2Xhm-rsIrfJny5WAXRDWDFBCzoM7NQZA5-Tg-2g7I97ngHSdhkexbhu0RdBNuXGcdedIHzyjOsWcrZZfSfbQ7cXfiPlMsVgzCQgvHF-GtfP48u2r32MGHYesoaX0e_6awQ0vW1rZpYheFhB6dC0vF_NvoUQiBBci2qNQA0C_ynUVqKWJeecuzUTLLKP9nnYZnkpfj2P-jNwdzSEyz0PZOCbLshjYwPOIrPj5X7DiiPewJhnDZNhY261iYpmZ_yPx5pCqlgsX-H6i3N2UFaZgs8W0K1LKqeQUg1RbMQP' alt='Zelensky addresses Ukrainians, pledging not to betray national interests amid peace plan talks.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Thanksgiving deadline: President Trump said next Thursday is an “appropriate” deadline for Kyiv to accept the peace framework, though it could be extended if talks are “working well” [time.com#1][scmp.com#1][politico.eu#1].</li><li>Core concessions: The draft plan would freeze front lines, recognize Crimea and parts of Donetsk/Luhansk as de facto Russian, limit Ukraine’s forces to 600,000, and bar NATO membership permanently [politico.eu#2][cbsnews.com#2][bbc.com#1].</li><li>Aid pressure reports: Multiple reports say U.S. support could be curtailed if Kyiv rejects the framework, including warnings on weapons and intelligence sharing [straitstimes.com#5][theglobeandmail.com#4][politico.eu#1].</li><li>European response: European leaders expressed support for Zelensky and frustration at being sidelined, with concerns the plan skews toward Moscow’s demands [nytimes.com#1][politico.eu#1].</li><li>Russian reaction: President Vladimir Putin said the U.S. proposal “could form the basis of a final peace settlement,” while noting Moscow had not discussed details extensively with Washington [npr.org#2][ndtv.com#2][straitstimes.com#7].</li></ul><blockquote>We will work calmly with America and all partners. - Volodymyr Zelensky</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Volodymyr Zelensky: Vows not to “betray” Ukraine; says any deal must ensure a “real and dignified peace,” and that Kyiv will work “calmly” with America and partners [ndtv.com#1][pbs.org#1][aljazeera.com#1].
