Apple released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-26/">watchOS 26</a> yesterday, and if you have a Series 9 or later or an Ultra 2 or later, there are a surprising number of useful new features. Apple could have limited new additions like Sleep Score and Hypertension notifications to the newest Apple Watch models, but now you don't need to buy a new watch to get helpful features.<br/>

 <li><strong>Widgets</strong> - <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> in the Smart Stack are customizable, so you can rearrange them to show what's most important to you first. Third-party apps are supported.</li><br/>

 <li><strong>Sleep Score</strong> - Sleep Score gives you a number-based evaluation of your sleep quality. It takes into account sleep duration, the number of times you woke up in the night, and when you went to bed.</li><br/>

<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Smart Actions</strong> - The Messages app can suggest smart actions like location sharing, providing an address, and more based on the context of a text.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Smart Replies</strong> - Smart replies have been improved so you should get more relevant one-tap responses for incoming messages.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Live Translation</strong> - The Messages app supports Live Translation, so incoming texts in another language can be translated to your language.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Backgrounds</strong> - Personalized backgrounds that you create for conversations on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sync to the watch.</li><br/>

<ul><br/>
 <li><strong>Photos</strong> - The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> watch face uses Liquid Glass for the time, and the size and location of the time adjust based on the image that's being displayed. The shuffle option also uses Featured content from &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Flow</strong> - Flow is a watch face designed for Liquid Glass. It features an orb of color with Liquid Glass numbers.</li><br/>
 <li><strong>Exactograph</strong> - Exactograph has hour, minute, and second dials for precise time keeping. If you tap on the face, it zooms in on the minutes and seconds dials so you can measure in even smaller increments of time.</li><br/>

 <li><strong>Hermes</strong> - There's a Hermes Faubourg Party watch face for Hermes watches. It displays different animations based on the time of day.</li><br/>

</ul><br/>
<h2 id="other_features">Other Features</h2><br/>
