<p>In the latest escalation of tensions with Venezuela, the United States has formally designated the so‑called Cartel de los Soles, which it links to President Nicolás Maduro and senior Venezuelan officials, as a foreign terrorist organization effective Monday. The Trump administration says the move provides new legal tools for sanctions and potential military operations as it increases its naval and air presence in the Caribbean near Venezuelan waters. Officials describe the group as a network inside Venezuela’s security forces involved in drug trafficking, although NPR notes that experts say it does not function like a traditional cartel with a clear hierarchy. The administration is also weighing tactics such as psychological operations, including dropping information leaflets over Caracas, and what some reports describe as a new phase that could include covert actions to pressure Maduro’s government without launching a full‑scale invasion. Venezuela’s leadership, which already faces extensive US sanctions, rejects Washington’s accusations and views the measures as part of an effort to destabilize the country.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/cUpVfOB46y1r6XbFCs3FbpYBiszslkHu71uIFxJN6OWRWHzieehrJpDryrQ4ll59mluYbZeK3M0nttmTXabzKXUi1VfpdEmVkNI3S1ePjDtrd3anqexf-ocI18SVgzD_d763_p2HRvlDIttgVGPJ0PJ85G_G0E8a4LDXHUhJeTKd_npvcePkaHYhsOy8uOxNIcgnKitoCDEp4JBALPkpy3VlXTRsJiEr_SFknUA' alt='The aircraft carrier USS Gerald Ford conducting operations in the Caribbean amid rising US–Venezuela tensions.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Military buildup: US moves include a growing naval deployment in the Caribbean, with vessels such as the aircraft carrier USS Gerald Ford operating in the region as part of operations publicly framed as counter‑narcotics but now increasingly tied to pressure on Caracas.</li><li>Legal implications: Placing the Cartel de los Soles on the State Department’s terror list allows the US to criminalize material support, freeze assets under terrorism authorities, and open the door to using counterterrorism powers to justify operations against individuals it associates with the group inside Venezuela.</li><li>Psychological operations: US officials are actively discussing the use of leaflet drops over Caracas as a psychological warfare tactic, aiming to influence Venezuelan public opinion and undercut Maduro’s authority without direct combat.</li><li>Covert options: Reporting from regional and US outlets indicates that Washington is also preparing for a possible new phase of Venezuela‑focused action that could involve clandestine operations designed to weaken Maduro’s inner circle and security apparatus.</li><li>Terminology debate: Analysts cited by NPR caution that Cartel de los Soles is more a loose label for alleged networks within Venezuela’s security forces than a clearly structured cartel, raising questions about how the broad US designation will be interpreted in practice.</li></ul><blockquote>The designation provides new tools for our efforts to combat the destabilizing and criminal activities of Nicolas Maduro and his associates. - Unnamed senior US administration official (as quoted)</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US administration: Officials argue that treating Cartel de los Soles as a terrorist organization will let Washington use counterterrorism authorities against what it portrays as a drug‑trafficking and criminal network embedded in Venezuela’s state structures.
