<p>Professor Solomon worked in ethics, particularly virtue ethics. At Notre Dame he was the founding director of the <a href="https://ethicscenter.nd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">de Nicola Center for Ethics and Culture</a> and the Arts &amp; Letters/Science Honors Program. A festschrift for Solomon, <em><a href="https://www.baylorpress.com/9781481310413/beyond-the-self/">Beyond the Self: Virtue Ethics and the Problem of Culture</a></em> was published in 2019. You can learn more about his writing <a href="https://philpapers.org/s/David%20Solomon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Solomon joined the Notre Dame faculty in 1968. He earned his PhD from the University of Texas and his undergraduate degree from Baylor University.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://irfankhawajaphilosopher.com/2025/03/01/w-david-solomon-1944-2025-rip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obituary</a>, one of Solomon&#8217;s former doctoral students, Irfan Khawaja, writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Solomon often joked about being a “Southern guy with a Jewish name, a Baptist upbringing, and a Catholic perspective on the world”–every word of which was true. I’m none of those things, and we ended up disagreeing about a lot, especially the last part. He was an unapologetic defender of what always struck me as the most reactionary parts of Catholic doctrine. But disagreements with him were always productive. He was always eager to have them. He was never intemperate or intolerant in conversation. He was a model of candor. And even if you rejected virtually every argument, as I did, you learned something important from the exchange. </em></p>
<p>W. David Solomon died on February 26, 2025 from leukemia and esophageal cancer.</p>
