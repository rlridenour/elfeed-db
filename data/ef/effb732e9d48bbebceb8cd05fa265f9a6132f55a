         
         <p>I just published the prototype of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote</code>: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/consult-denote">https://github.com/protesilaos/consult-denote</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is to use Consult across the various prompts of Denote to get
the helpful features of previewing and narrowing. In addition, we can
leverage Consult to perform searches in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code>.</p>

<p>At this stage, I want to get a better sense of what we can do with
Consult to help users of Denote. If this is something people are
interested in, then we can check how to extend it further and
eventually produce a formal package for inclusion in GNU ELPA.</p>

<p>What <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote</code> does as of this writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provides a drop-in replacement for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-file-prompt</code>. This is
used in a variety of commands, such as those that link between
Denote files.</li>
  <li>Defines a source for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-buffer</code> which lists buffers that visit
Denote files. We call these “Denote buffers”.</li>
  <li>Introduces thin wrappers to search by files contents or name in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code>. The commands are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote-grep</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote-find</code>. The user options <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote-grep-command</code>
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote-find-command</code> control which Consult function is
called.</li>
  <li>Adds the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote-mode</code> to set up Consult-powered prompts in
place of the generic ones that Denote offers. Currently, this is not
done in the way I intend to do it: it uses the advice mechanism,
though my plan is to modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote.el</code> (or others) to run the
function prompts via a variable, thus giving packages like this one
the option to cleanly define their own replacements.</li>
</ul>

<p>I repeat, this is a prototype. I am not distributing a user manual at
this stage, nor am I doing any video demonstration. Let us first have
a fully fledged package. Then we go with the flow.</p>
