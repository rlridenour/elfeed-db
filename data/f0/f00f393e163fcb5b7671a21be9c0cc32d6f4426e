Nearly three months have passed by since Apple last released new devices, but the AirTag could be receiving an update fairly soon, according to rumors.<br/>

Last year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a new AirTag would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/">released around the middle of 2025</a>. In February, a leaker known as Kosutami claimed that Apple planned to release a new AirTag <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/airtag-2-in-may-or-june-rumor/">in May or June</a> this year. If these timeframes remain accurate, an AirTag 2 could launch within the next month. If so, perhaps the AirTag 2 will be announced during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/apple-announces-wwdc-2025-schedule/">WWDC 2025 keynote on Monday, June 9</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Three upgrades have been rumored for the AirTag 2 so far:<ul><li>A second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/airtag-2-longer-range-rumor/">up to 3× longer range</a> compared to the current AirTag. The chip debuted in the iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models, there is a Precision Finding for People feature that can help you to find your friends in crowded places, and it offers a range of up to 200 feet (approximately 60 meters).</li><br/>
<li>A more tamper-proof speaker, as a safety measure to reduce stalking.</li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/">Improved integration with the Apple Vision Pro</a>.</li></ul>No major design changes are expected.<br/>
<br/>
The original AirTag was announced during an Apple Event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-airtags-tracking-devices/">in April 2021</a>. In the U.S., an individual AirTag costs &#36;29, and a set of four costs &#36;99.<br/>
