<p>MG Siegler, back on Sunday, <em>before</em> Judge Gonzales Rogers’s “<em>settle this between yourselves or I’ll see you in court next week</em>” <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/19/the-first-rule-of-legal-fight-club">order on Monday</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again, Sweeney is not a moron, he has to know all of this. But why
simply sit quietly when you have an excuse to poke the bear again
and raise hell for your cause? So that’s what he’s doing. He
wasn’t going to win the legal fight, but he could win the
political one. And now he’s not going to win <em>this</em> legal fight,
but he can win the pressure campaign. Especially important in the
weeks leading up to WWDC...</p>

<p>If I’m him, here’s the general game plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Re-submit Fortnite to the US App Store even though you have no
legal grounds to do so. No one will care about that. They will
have just read about your legal win and assume you won
everything and so Fortnite can return — even though this
particular aspect of the case had nothing to do with that.</li>
<li>When Apple rejects (or refuses to rule) on the new submission,
pull your app around the world under the notion that the
unified apps all have to be updated in unison, including an
element bringing the US back to the App Store. So yeah, blame
Apple for this. It may even technically be true, but it doesn’t
matter. Again, it’s a perception thing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-16/apple-denies-blocking-fortnite-from-eu-stores-in-epic-dispute?ref=spyglass.org">File a new legal claim against Apple</a> for blocking your
submission in light of the recent ruling. Again, this has no
legal grounds, but perhaps the Judge who issued that ruling is,
in fact, <a href="https://spyglass.org/tear-down-the-app-store-walls/">pissed off enough</a> to entertain this in some way — even if just in weighing in on it to dismiss it
sympathetically, thus generating more press, instead of
immediately dismissing it, legally.</li>
<li>Give more interviews about all of the above in the coming
weeks. Again, leading up to WWDC. Keep the pressure on.</li>
</ol>
