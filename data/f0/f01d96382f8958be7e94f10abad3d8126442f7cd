Over that the Emacs reddit, arni_ca asks about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1jfnfl6/ways_to_move_your_cursor_without_relying_on_the/">key bindings for cursor movement</a>. It&rsquo;s not quite clear what he&rsquo;s asking but the theme is moving the cursor without bindings like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd>,<br />
<kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd>,<br />
<kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd>,<br />
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd>, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>.

As is often the case, all the juice is in the comments. It&rsquo;s astounding how many different strategies people have for such movements. They range from everything to using the arrow keys to custom Elisp snippets. Take a look at the post to see if any of the ideas will work for you.

By now, you all know my answer to questions like this. I started with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/effective-emacs#h.p_ID_245">this epiphany from Steve Yegge</a>: large scale navigation—more than a few characters or lines—should be made with search. It&rsquo;s perfectly obvious but it occurs to few of us until someone points it out. The wonderful <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/avy">avy package</a> refines this strategy and offers finer grained control of where the cursor ends up. Avy is probably my most used set of commands. I use them constantly as I write and edit. Following <a href="https://karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/">Karthinks</a>, I&rsquo;ve mostly pared my use down to <code>avy-goto-char-timer</code> although I do sometimes still use <code>avy-goto-word-1</code>. Regardless, if you aren&rsquo;t already using Avy, you should take a look.  It&rsquo;s the backbone of my navigation.

The other navigation tool I use is an import from Vim: <a href="https://github.com/lewang/jump-char/tree/master">jump-char</a> that lets you jump to the next or previous instance of a character. It&rsquo;s  incredibly useful and, again, I use it several times a day. If you use Avy and Jump-char, you will have most of your navigation needs met.</p>
