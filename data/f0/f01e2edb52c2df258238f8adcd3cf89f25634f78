Apple's refurbished iPhones are unlocked, and they come with a new battery, a new outer shell, and a plain box with a USB-C cable. The devices are also covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty, and they are eligible for extended AppleCare+ or AppleCare One coverage. Apple says its refurbished products are thoroughly cleaned and tested, and generally they are virtually indistinguishable from brand new devices.<br/>

iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models feature 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays, respectively, up from the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro and 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max. Other new features included a Camera Control button, an A18 Pro chip optimized for Apple Intelligence, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, support for 4K at 120 FPS video recording, longer battery life, faster charging over MagSafe, and improved microphones.<br/>
