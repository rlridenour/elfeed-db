I want to articulate something I find confusing. It's not about Vim,
but rather about Vim users. (And since this is an Emacs blog, I'll
also give some Emacs pointers along the way.) I used Vim for a few
years and still like it a lot. When forced to edit text in a non-Emacs
editor, I usually use the editor's Vim emulation mode because there is
very often a decent one.
</p>

<p>
Vim users often say that what makes Vim great is that it has a
composable text editing language, and they'll tell you that what that
means is that you choose separately what text to operate on and what
operation to perform on it, and can combine any operation with any way
to select text. And you can choose those components in any order: in
what is called normal mode you first choose an operation and then an
operand; but if you prefer to do it the other way around, you can use
Vim's visual mode.
</p>

<p>
Here's what really confuses me: Vim users never tell you that this
composable editing model, of choosing separately what text to operate
on and operation to perform on it, is extremely common and is built-in
to almost all text editors. They also don't say it is unique to Vim, I
don't think, but it still feels very odd to rave about composability
when it is a commonplace feature. It feels like a friend excited about
their new car telling you that the model he bought is crazy cool
because it has tires!
</p>

<p>
Even the lowly Windows Notepad is a composable text editor: to select
text you can highlight with the mouse, use shift and the arrow keys,
double click to select a word, or triple click to select a line; once
you've selected you text you can press backspace to delete it, ctrl+x
to cut it to the clipboard, ctrl+v to replace it with the contents of
the clipboard, etc. There's a dearth of operations in notepad, but
they all compose with the various means of selecting text.
</p>

<p>
I don't think I've ever used a single text editor that isn't
composable in the sense Vim users explain. To me that is not at all
what makes Vim special ---it can't be since all text editors do that!
What I find most special about Vim is the variety of operations and of
ways to select text. I specially like all the fine-grained
distinctions Vim has to say exactly what stretch of text you want to
act on. In Emacs I missed Vim's distinction between words and WORDS
(the all caps one means a maximal consecutive stretch of
non-whitespace characters), so I wrote a command <code>mark-non-whitespace</code>
to mark the WORD at point. In Vim when you move by words you can
decide whether you want to land just beyond the end of the word or at
the beginning of the next word, which I also missed in Emacs until I
found the <code>forward-to-word</code> command in <code>misc.el</code>, which I bind to <code>M-F</code>.
</p>

<p>
After the sheer variety of motions, text objects and commands in Vim,
I think what I like best is the help you get in automating editing
tasks. First, commands can take a numeric repetition count. I don't
think that is common in text editors. I'm sure there are some others
that do it but, of the ones I've used, only vi, Vim and Emacs do that,
that I can recall. Second, there is the marvelous dot command, that
repeats the last editing operation (I say "editing operation" as
opposed to commands that only move the cursor without modifying the
text you are editing). With <code>n</code> to repeat the last search and <code>.</code> to
repeat the last editing command, you can really fly over text making
parallel edits all over the place: <code>n.n.nn.</code> (two <code>n</code>'s in a row because I
wanted to skip one search result!). And third, there are keyboard
macros to automate more complex tasks. I haven't used VS Code, but I
have heard it doesn't have keyboard macros (except maybe in a plugin),
which sounds like a very hostile-to-automation way to design a text
editor.
</p>

<p>
Of course, Emacs also has ways of repeating the last command; there
are <code>repeat</code> and <code>repeat-complex-command</code>, for example. But the experience
in Vim with <code>.</code> is smoother and it illustrates a subtlety about the
composable editing model: Vim's <code>.</code> repeats the last combination of an
editing operation and text selection, those two parts are fused
together into a single repeatable unit. I guess you could say that is
a sense in which Vim is composable and many other editors are not
(though I don't often see Vim users making this point; they tend to
explain what they mean by composability as I did above, accidentally
describing every text editor in existence). In Emacs when you use
<code>repeat</code> or <code>repeat-complex-command</code> you only get the last Emacs command
repeated, which might only be half of the fused operation-selection
whole. To get an experience more similar to Vim's <code>.</code> in Emacs, you can
try the <a href="https://github.com/wyrickre/dot-mode">dot-mode</a> package, which makes a keyboard macros out of the
last consecutive stretch of buffer-modifying commands. In a way, I
like it even better than Vim's <code>.</code> command, because, and this will sound
funny: it's a little less stressful to use for certain personality
types. In Vim I constantly paused to think: "can I do the next edit in
a single command so that I can repeat the whole thing with <code>.</code>?", and
would be disappointed in myself whenever I made an edit using two or
more commands, soon after needed to repeat it and hadn't though to
record a macro, and doubly disappointed if I then realized I <i>could</i>
have done it in a single command! With dot-mode you can relax: you get
all the consecutive editing commands you made repeated, not just the
last one.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays I don't even use dot-mode in Emacs anymore, sticking to
keyboard macros. But I have made their use as frictionless for me as
possible. First, I bind <code>kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter</code> to <code>M-r</code>
and <code>kmacro-end-or-call-macro</code> to <code>M-m</code>, where find I them more readily
accessible than at the default bindings of <code>&lt;f3&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;f4&gt;</code> (specially
since on my laptop I need to press the <code>fn</code> key to use functions keys).
And I bind <code>M-n</code> to a command that repeats the last isearch so I can
play the <code>n.n.nn.</code> game in Emacs too by holding down the meta key and
going <code>nmnmnnm</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #531ab6;">defun</span> <span style="color: #721045;">isearch-next</span> ()
  <span style="color: #2a5045; font-style: italic;">"Go to next isearch match."</span>
  (<span style="color: #531ab6;">interactive</span>)
  (<span style="color: #531ab6;">if</span> (equal isearch-string <span style="color: #3548cf;">""</span>)
      (<span style="color: #884900;">user-error</span> <span style="color: #3548cf;">"No previous search."</span>)
    (<span style="color: #531ab6;">let</span> (isearch-lazy-highlight)
      (isearch-repeat 'forward))
    (isearch-exit)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now let me get back to what I like about Vim: so far I've said (1)
variety of operations and way to select text, especially the
fine-grained selection distinctions, (2) features for automation:
repeat counts, the dot command and keyboard macros. To that I'd add
(3) the concept of buffer: that text need not reside in a file to be
edited in Vim (this is also a key idea in Emacs, of course), and I
very often put text in a new temporary buffer to save it for later or
to edit it quickly and paste somewhere else; and, of course, (4)
extensive customizability. As you can see what I like about Vim is
basically also what I like about Emacs. What can I say? When it comes
to text editors I definitely have a type!
</p>

<p>
Of course, some Vim users do also mention all the other neat features
of Vim that I like, but why are there so many blog and forum posts
about Vim's composability that don't mention this is the normal way
for text editors to be designed? Here are a few conjectures, none of
which I really believe:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Vim users who talk about composability have never used any other
text editor and don't know those are composable too. This would
explain the situation but seems exceedingly unlikely.</li>
<li>Vim users think that Vim does composability better than other
editors but fail to explain in what ways is better and wind up
describing composability in a way that other editors also have. This
is possible: explaining things is hard (I do it for a living and am
still terrible at it); and there are ways in which composability in
Vim is better, namely the <code>.</code> command repeating an edit comprising an
operation-selection pair.</li>
<li>Vim users don't really believe other text editors lack
composability, what truly bothers them is that in addition to
composability other editor also offer as shortcuts some fused
operation-selection combos. For example Emacs will let you mark a
region by any means you wish and then compose that with a
<code>kill-region</code> command, but it also offers <code>kill-word</code>, <code>kill-line</code>,
<code>kill-sentence</code>, <code>kill-paragraph</code>, etc. Maybe what Vim users really like
is Vim's principled insistence in not offering shortcuts, making you
always specify an operation and a target text separately? I don't
think this either matches what they say or makes much sense really
---why would it bother you that other software offers additional
shortcuts?. (Also, Vim does have a few shortcuts: for example, in
insert mode <code>&lt;C-w&gt;</code> deletes the previous word.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
To me the prevalence of people saying "Vim is great because it is
composable" and then explaining composability in a way that applies to
every text editor I've ever used is just one of life's mysteries.
