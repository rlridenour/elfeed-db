<p>In its comments on Singer, the magazine <a href="https://time.com/collections/time100-philanthropy-2025/7286017/peter-singer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>His 1972 essay “Famine, Affluence, and Morality” argued that people ought to prevent suffering from death and poverty when they can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance. It has long influenced giving strategies for wealthy donors and laid the foundation for the effective altruism movement. Meanwhile, his 1975 book </em>Animal Liberation<em>, which argued that the interests of non-human animals deserve equal moral consideration, helped launch the modern animal welfare movement.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Last year, Singer’s charity, The Life You Can Save, which makes research-based recommendations of nonprofits fighting extreme poverty, passed the $100 million mark in donations to organizations it recommends, a decade after its founding. And in recognition of his impact, Singer, a professor emeritus of bioethics at Princeton, won the Berggruen Prize for Philosophy &amp; Culture in 2021, donating the $1 million that came with it to high-impact charities tackling extreme poverty and animal suffering.</em></p>
<p>Singer was included in the &#8220;Innovators&#8221; category</p>
<p>You can view the whole list, which includes economist Tyler Cowen, philanthropy critic Anand Giridharadas, as well as major donors like Michael Bloomberg, Oprah Winfrey, K.
