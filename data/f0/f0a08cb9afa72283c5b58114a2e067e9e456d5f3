iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 will include a preinstalled Preview app from Apple, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/apple-wwdc-2025-preview-ios-26-macos-26-new-ai-features-ipados-26-redesigns"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

In a lengthy report outlining his WWDC 2025 expectations today, Gurman said that the Preview app will provide iPhone and iPad users with an all-in-one, built-in solution for managing, editing, and annotating PDF documents.<br/>
<br/>
The app will look similar to Apple's longstanding Preview app on the Mac, he said:<blockquote>The software looks similar to the Mac version, and its launch screen is in the same style as apps like Pages and Keynote. It includes a big logo on the top portion of the screen advertising the Preview name and a gallery of document options below it.</blockquote>Gurman did not say if the Preview app on the iPhone and iPad will also offer basic image editing abilities, like it does on the Mac.<br/>
