<p>On <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/micro.blog/mac/Micro.blog_3.6.5.zip">Micro.blog for macOS</a>, the application can now display a preview of your post using your blog theme. To do this, check <strong>Use blog theme</strong> in the preview window:</p>

<p>This is especially useful if you post code snippets in markdown and want to make sure you got the <a href="img%20src=%22https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96826/2025/web-summary.png%22%20width=%22600%22%20height=%22477%22%20alt=%22Auto-generated%20description:%20A%20text%20editing%20interface%20for%20creating%20blog%20posts%20is%20shown%20with%20options%20for%20entering%20a%20title%20and%20summary,%20featuring%20buttons%20for%20generating%20text%20and%20publishing.%22">right syntax</a> highlighted.</p>
<p>By the way, to see the latest changes to the macOS Micro.blog app, look under <strong><a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/micro-blog-for-mac/45">Micro.blog for Mac</a></strong> in the Micro.blog help forms.</p>
<p>More on the macOS application:</p>
<p>Under <strong>View</strong>, you also have the option to turn on <strong>Summary</strong>. The Summary can be written manually or generated by AI, if you have turned on AI assistance for your blog.</p>

<p>On the web, the <strong>Summary</strong> is under your post text. You need to select it to expand it and view the text field, with the <strong>Generate</strong> option for AI underneath:</p>

<p>The AI writes summaries in a factual third-person kind of way; I find that I prefer to use my own summaries. However, for long posts (especially if I write them in parts over a couple of days) I find that it&rsquo;s helpful to use it just to remember what I was yapping about, and then rewrite it as a human.</p>
<p>Summaries are important when you cross-post to Mastodon or Bluesky: these become the posts that will show there with a link to your full posts. No more posts that cut mid-sentence once you reach the character limit on these social networks.</p>
<p>Speaking of AI assistance, selecting <strong>Copy HTML</strong> on images, both on the web and the macOS versions, will now copy the HTML for the image <em>with</em> the  AI-generated alt description for the image directly. You don&rsquo;t need to go into the uploads section of your blog and find the image again with the embedded code. The AI-generated alt descriptions will start with &ldquo;Auto-generated description&rdquo; to ensure your readers know AI generated them.</p>
<p>I find that the AI-generated descriptions are especially good for photos, and often don&rsquo;t need retouching. This is great if you take quick posts and attach a single image with the image button, especially on your mobile device, as the description will be included in your post.</p>
