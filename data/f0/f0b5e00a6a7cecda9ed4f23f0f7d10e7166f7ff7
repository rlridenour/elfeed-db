<p>As I prune my <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/">Emacs config</a> off, I came across a forgotten bit of elisp I wrote about 6 years ago. While it's not going to power up your Emacs fu, it may lift your spirits, or maybe just aid discovery of new words.</p>
<p>You see, I had forgotten about <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el">zone.el</a> altogether: a fabulous package to tickle your heart. You can think of it as screensaver built into Emacs.</p>
<p>If the built-in zones don't do it for ya, check out the few on melpa (<a href="https://depp.brause.cc/zone-nyan/">nyan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kawabata/zone-sl">sl</a>, and <a href="https://xenodium.com/added-emacs-zone-rainbow/">rainbow</a>).</p>
<p>So, my nostalgic bit of elisp dates <code>Jun 17 2016</code>: a basic but functional zone (<a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/zone-words.el">zone-words</a>), displaying words from <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a>. Surely the package can use plenty of improvements (<a href="https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/commit/00215e215be1413ea9d0085dd2de5123c635b8c0">here's one</a>), but hey this is Emacs and pretty much all existing code will run, no matter how old. In Emacs time, 2016 is practically yesterday!</p>
