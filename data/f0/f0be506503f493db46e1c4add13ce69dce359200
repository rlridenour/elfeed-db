<p>Despite the name of his blog, <em>Hypercritical</em>, I&#8217;ve always appreciated the measured tone John Siracusa takes when it comes to criticizing Apple. From the outside, it&#8217;s always easy to oversimplify analysis of what&#8217;s going on in a trillion-dollar company, and John doesn&#8217;t do that. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s why his recent post, <a href="https://hypercritical.co/2025/05/09/apple-turnover">Apple Turnover</a>, stands out for me, in that John makes a simple argument that Apple has lost its North Star and needs a management change. It&#8217;s hard to argue with his logic.</p>
