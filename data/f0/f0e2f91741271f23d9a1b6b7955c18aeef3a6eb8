<p>In Fredric Brown&#8217;s 1954 short short story <a href="https://cyborgink.com/2023/02/26/experiment-fredric-brown-1954/">&#8220;Experiment,&#8221;</a> Professor Johnson displays a brass cube and proposes to send it backward in time. An identical cube appears in his time machine at 2:55, and Johnson announces that at 3:00 he will complete the transaction by sending his own cube 5 minutes into the past.</p>
<p>A friend asks: What would happen if he changed his mind and didn&#8217;t send it?</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no paradox at all. The cube remained.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the entire rest of the Universe, professors and all, vanished.&#8221;</p>
