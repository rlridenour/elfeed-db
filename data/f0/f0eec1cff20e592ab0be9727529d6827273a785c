Apple is allowing members of its public beta testing program to download and install <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a> starting today. You can sign up for the public betas <a href="https://beta.apple.com">on Apple's beta website</a>. The first public beta features the same content as the fourth developer beta that came out earlier this week, though there is a new fourth beta available for developers as well. <br/>

Beta testers that have registered on Apple's website can download the &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 26&zwnj; updates by opening the Settings app, going to the General section, tapping on Software Update, and choosing the &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPadOS 26&zwnj; Public Beta options.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 26&zwnj; feature Apple's Liquid Glass design, with a visual aesthetic that focuses on transparency. Icons, menu buttons, navigation bars, and more reflect and refract light with subtle animations. There are pop-out menus in some areas, tab bars shrink down, and everything has a more rounded look.<br/>
