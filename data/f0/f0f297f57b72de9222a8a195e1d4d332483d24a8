<h3 id="its-not-easy-changing-browsers">It’s not easy changing browsers</h3>
<p>After using Arc since the end of 2022, <a href="https://vivaldi.com" target="_blank">Vivaldi</a> is my new default browser.</p>
<p>Why change, and why choose Vivaldi?</p>
<p>I’d been feeling uneasy for some time about relying so much on an app with no apparent sustainable business model, that was starting to push <span class="small-caps">AI</span>. I’m not interested in paying for my browser, and the hint of a subscription was definitely in the air.</p>
<p>Arc isn’t dying, according to The Browser Company but it’s no longer under active development, with the bulk of the Arc team now focusing on an AI-driven product called Dia. I struggle to express just how <em>not into</em> <span class="small-caps">AI</span> tools in my browser I am.</p>
<p>Vivaldi seems stable, sustainable, and has a good community behind it. It’s privacy focused and allows installing Chrome extensions, both strong pluses in my book.</p>
<h3 id="muscle-memory-rebellion">Muscle memory rebellion!</h3>
<p>A few days in I experienced some muscle memory rebellion demanding I go back to Arc, but no, I am holding strong! Vivaldi is slowly taking shape. Bit by bit I’m learning to do the things I used to do in Arc without thinking.</p>
<p>And of course the things I used to do in Arc without thinking are the things I had to make myself learn bit by bit when I was a new user, resisting the muscle memory rebellion that was demanding I return to Brave.</p>
<p>One of the things I liked about Arc was the <span class="small-caps">⌘⇧C</span> shortcut for copying the current <span class="small-caps">URL</span>. I haven’t yet found a one-step solution for this in Vivaldi so I’ve created a Keyboard Maestro macro that lets me use the same <span class="small-caps">⌘⇧C</span> shortcut for a 2-step process: <span class="small-caps">⌘L</span> followed by <span class="small-caps">⌘C</span>.</p>
<p>It took a while to get used to the way Vivaldi handles tabs and bookmarks but now I like it. On the whole I’m finding that switching browsers has been a good thing for tightening up my workflow and cleaning out some bookmark cruft.</p>
<p><a href="https://pkm.social/@jarango@mastodon.social" target="_blank">Jorge Arango</a> mentioned that Vivaldi doesn’t have profiles in its iOS version, so he prefers Safari. One day when I need a nice tech-distraction I’ll <em>finally</em> learn how to use Safari properly.</p>
<p>I’m part way through <a href="https://crossedwires.net/podcast/build-a-browser/" target="_blank">this podcast</a> with Vivaldi’s creator, and so far I like what they stand for very much. Next up: learn more about Vivaldi’s features so I can choose which will fit in with my workflow.</p>
<h3 id="plain-text-spotlight">Plain Text Spotlight</h3>
<p><a href="https://mikegrindle.com/waffle/" target="_blank">Waffle</a> is a script from Mike Grindle that<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>enables users to search, edit and append a&nbsp;.md file stored in their home directory (~/obtf.md) from a terminal.”</p>
<p>I like it because it’s another good example of someone crafting their own system on top of a simple text file. There are features without lock-in, but above all there is the flexibility to take it or leave it.</p>
<p>I won’t be using it because my One Big Text File is just a scratchpad. I’m happy with a simple text file that I search by the classifiers I add to each entry. It’s like a searchable Bullet Journal.</p>
