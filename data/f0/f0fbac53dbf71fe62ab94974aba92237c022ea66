Woot today has brought back its <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Fplus%2Fapple-watch-band-discovery-box-buy-1-get-some-free">sale on Apple Watch Solo Loop and Braided Solo Loop bands</a>, but with a twist. This time, when you buy any Solo Loop or Braided Solo Loop at a discount on Woot, you'll get up to two extra bands for free.<br/>

<br/>
The way it works is when you purchase any Solo Loop band for the discounted price of <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-watch-solo-loop-discovery-box-buy-1-band-get-2-free%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_1"><strong>&#36;19.99</strong></a> (&#36;29 off), you will get two additional Solo Loop bands for free. When you purchase any Braided Solo Loop for the discounted price of <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-watch-braided-solo-loop-discovery-box-buy-1-band-get-1-free%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_2"><strong>&#36;29.99</strong></a> (&#36;69 off), you will get one additional Braided Solo Loop band for free.<br/>

<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Fplus%2Fapple-watch-band-discovery-box-buy-1-get-some-free"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">BUY ONE GET 2 FREE</div>Apple Watch Bands at Woot</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
The catch here is that you won't be able to pick out the color of the bands. You start by selecting the size of the band and Apple Watch model, then Woot will randomly select three Solo Loop bands or two Braided Solo Loop bands to send to you.<br/>
<br/>
Woot guarantees that each band will be a unique color and there will be no duplicate colors in each box. These are also in new condition and come individually packaged in their original Apple retail packaging, as well as with a one year Apple manufacturer limited warranty.<br/>
<br/>
Although there's a bit of risk at play in Woot's new sale, these are massive discounts on the Apple Watch bands, and it's a great way to expand your band collection and try out new colors. This sale will run through April 25 at 11:59 p.m. Central Time.<br/>
