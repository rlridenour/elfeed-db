<p>We know more or less everything we could possibly know about ancient Egyptian civilization. That owes in large part to the advanced state of record-keeping it achieved, and how many of its writings have survived, up to and including — as previously featured here on Open Culture — a <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2019/01/an-ancient-egyptian-homework-assignment-from-1800-years-ago.html">homework assignment</a> and a <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2022/02/3200-year-old-egyptian-tablet-shows-why-people-missed-work-the-scorpion-bit-him-brewing-beer-more.html">list of excuses</a> given by builders who missed work. There just happens to be one especially glaring gap in our knowledge: exactly how the ancient Egyptians built the <a href="http://openculture.com/2021/10/a-walking-tour-around-the-pyramids-of-giza-2-hours-in-hi-def.html">Pyramids of Giza</a>. This intersection of relative ignorance and extreme fascination has, as architecture YouTuber Dami Lee <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5kWDOuY2Uo">acknowledges in the video above</a>, inspired no end of crackpot-ism. Nothing could be as unpromising as unsolicited contact from someone claiming to have discovered the secret of the pyramids.</p>
<p>The case of a Korean independent researcher called Huni Choi proved to be different, for reasons Lee uses the video to lay out. Conventional assumptions about how the pyramids were built hold that workers would have had to drag the stones up one or more ramps,&nbsp;though the dimensions of the structures dictate that&nbsp;the project would necessitate huge, complex, or huge and complex ramp systems — whose own construction has somehow left behind not a trace of evidence.</p>

<p>According to Choi, “the Great Pyramid wasn’t built on its own, but through a chain of ‘sacrificial’ structures” designed to be “cannibalized.” The idea is that the pyramids were “overbuilt,” starting with a gigantic “trapezoidal mass” with an integrated ramp system, which, after being topped out, was then carved down into the pyramid shape we still find so familiar and compelling.</p>
<p>If true, Choi’s theory would solve the long-intractable problem of the pointed tops, which posed such a thorny engineering problem that even other pyramid-building civilizations seemingly avoided even attempting them. It also accounts for how the Egyptian designers and builders could have kept an eye on the angles all the while, in order to make sure the things were going up straight. And what of the leftover stone cut away from each pyramid? Why, it would simply have been re-used for the construction of the next one. This all squares not just with the estimated mass of the Giza complex, but also with apparent ancient Egyptian attitudes toward the natural and built environment. Alas, unlike in, say, physics, an archaeological theory like this one remains difficult to prove dispositively, barring another technological breakthrough that enables a new form of analysis of the pyramids themselves. Still, it’s a lot more satisfying than just assuming some ancient aliens did it.</p>
