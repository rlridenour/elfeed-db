<p>Israeli strikes hit multiple locations across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, with Gaza’s Hamas-run civil defence reporting at least 13 deaths, including five children. Israel’s military said it carried out a precise strike near a launch point after a projectile was launched from the Gaza City area but fell inside Gaza. The incident comes amid a fragile, US-sponsored ceasefire in place since October 10 that has largely reduced fighting, though both Israel and Hamas have accused the other of violations and the next phase of the truce remains delayed.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/7Ok-cZV4P07gILZwEBQyo_FniQRdVgS87yyXE3ai8149_v3sOmOrapzNwYrtz7iHKuJefwtmn1UEGlBuE-pRabKHwRNr2mWjKV17VEmtcgHd' alt='Palestinians walk past destroyed buildings in a neighbourhood heavily damaged during the war, in Gaza City, January 5, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tent shelter hit: Gaza’s civil defence said a drone strike hit a tent sheltering displaced people in southern Gaza, killing four people, including three children.</li><li>School area strike: Civil defence reported a separate strike on a school in northern Gaza that killed one person, alongside other incidents near Jabalia refugee camp.</li><li>Ceasefire toll claims: Gaza’s health ministry has reported at least 425 Palestinians killed since the ceasefire began, while the Israeli military said militants killed three Israeli soldiers over the same period.</li><li>Aid access rules: Israel said it barred entry to Gaza for some foreign medical and humanitarian staff from organisations told to halt operations unless they register employee details and meet new requirements, prompting NGOs to weigh compliance.</li><li>Iran protests noted: Separately, The New Arab reported protests spreading across Iran after a call by the exiled crown prince, with authorities cutting internet and international phone access, limiting verification of the demonstrations’ scope.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli military: Israel said it carried out a precise strike on the launch point after a projectile fired from the Gaza City area fell within the Gaza Strip, and said it was checking reports of casualties from other strikes.
