<p>Jake Schumacher, director of the 2017 documentary <em><a href="https://appdocumentary.com/">App: The Human Story</a></em>, sent me a note that Sebastiaan de With’s post this week, “<a href="https://www.lux.camera/physicality-the-new-age-of-ui/">Physicality: The New Age of UI</a>” (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/03/sdw-physicality-new-age">my thoughts here</a>), reminded him of a clip from the movie where Neven Mrgan compared Skeuomorphic design to classic cars from the 1940s and ’50s. So true. If you’ve got two and a half minutes to spare, watch this.</p>
