<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Adding an Emacs function to quickly toggle default browser.
</p>
        <p>These days I run a few different browsers.  My baseline default browser is the
<a href="https://mullvad.net/en/browser">Mullvad Browser</a>; when I open a URL its in this browser.  Leaking the least
amount of information.</p>
<p>When I want persisted sessions, I jump over to Firefox but with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin">uBlock Origin</a>
and <a href="https://noscript.net/">NoScript</a> which prompts me to make decisions about each and every domain that
tries to load a resource.</p>
<p>And when I don’t want to fuck around with various privacy antics, I load up
Safari.</p>
<p>What I found was that I would want to shift my default browser to accomodate
some odd task I was attempting.  So <time datetime="2025-02-05" title="2025-02-05">today</time> I wrote an <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
 function to help me
quickly set my default browser.  This leverages the <a href="https://github.com/kerma/defaultbrowser">defaultbrowser MacOS shell
command</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the interactive command that makes this change quicker:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(defun jf/default-browser (&amp;optional name)
  &quot;Set the default browser based on the given NAME.&quot;
  ;; brew install defaultbrowser
  (interactive (list
                 (completing-read
                   &quot;Browser: &quot;
                   '(&quot;mullvadbrowser&quot; &quot;firefox&quot; &quot;safari&quot;))))
  (shell-command (concat &quot;defaultbrowser &quot; name)))
</code></pre>
<p>This is a minor quality of life improvement, but one that helps me navigate a
surveillance capitalism hell-scape.</p>
