<p>Venezuela’s interim authorities said they are releasing a “significant” or “important” number of prisoners—Venezuelans and foreign nationals—in what they described as a unilateral gesture to “seek” or “consolidate” peace. The move comes days after US forces captured Nicolás Maduro and transferred him to the United States to face federal charges, and as Washington pressed for detainees to be freed. Several outlets framed the releases as an attempt by the new leadership under Delcy Rodríguez to ease international pressure while maintaining control at home. For families and supporters, the first releases offered a tangible moment of relief, even as uncertainty remains about how broad the measure will be and whether any restrictions will apply.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/gHVpmy34ACqHxZYK9aPzR0kACsLIN6fln_SP2ULQ_DkylEAyKQ3s6RNh5krb9jSlAGC6np7Tm0lruAejnxxYzuxx3znwU-J0bhHeAnKqTJtOeMz8AL83vHt-37SGPnibmZKYO76smGb5h9XrULSbDNWl80XAo-hkP5LDKAx-69oH1TIAoHjEAlCxYb43VzDcpxyHpVE6oPfr06nVtasy5ciIR2y9kRrg-cWWXFgv' alt='A mother waits outside El Helicoide prison in Caracas as releases begin.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Named releases: Reports named some of those freed, including opposition figure and former presidential candidate Enrique Márquez and opposition member Biagio Pilieri.</li><li>Spanish nationals: Spain’s foreign ministry confirmed the release of five Spanish citizens as part of the initial wave.</li><li>Human rights case: Barron’s reported the release of prominent Spanish-Venezuelan human rights activist Rocío San Miguel, citing her lawyer.</li><li>Argentina detainees: Mercopress reported that three Argentine nationals were among the foreign political prisoners released by the interim government.</li><li>US domestic pushback: Deutsche Welle reported the US Senate voted to curb further military operations in Venezuela by President Trump.</li></ul><blockquote>It is a unilateral gesture of peace and was not agreed upon with any other party - Jorge Rodríguez</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Venezuela’s National Assembly leadership: National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez described the releases as a unilateral “peace” gesture aimed at peaceful coexistence, without saying how many people would be freed immediately.
