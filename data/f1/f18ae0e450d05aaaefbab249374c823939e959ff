embark-org.el file missing This issue is a repeat1 of an old, closed one. because I cannot re-open that issue. I have tried the fixes mentioned there and more, but to no avail.
What&rsquo;s wrong when straight builds the embark package, it omits the embark-org.el file which is present in its embark repository directory. This results in blocking errors as I have things that depend upon functions from embark-org.
Directions to reproduce (use-package embark)
