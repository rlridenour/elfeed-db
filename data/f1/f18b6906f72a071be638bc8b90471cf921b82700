<p>From Lee Sallows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Numerical panmagic squares of 3&#215;3 being impossible, the above square is in fact the first known order-3 panmagic square, a boast it can enjoy until the day that someone comes up with an improved solution. Such as one using all nine <em>connected</em> pieces, say.</p>
<p>Or not, perhaps? For the square above has a further property that other panmagic squares may not possess. Choose any three of the four corner pieces. There are four possibilities: <em>aci</em>, <em>cig</em>, <em>agi</em> and <em>acg</em>. Whatever your choice, the three pieces selected will tile the target.
