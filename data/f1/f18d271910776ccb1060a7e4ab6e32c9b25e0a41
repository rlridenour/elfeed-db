The motorized shades are designed to raise or lower via an included remote control, the Apple Home app, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands, or time-based automations. There are options to integrate shade controls with other smart home products, or based on whether or not someone is home.<br/>

GE's Smart Shades support Matter over Thread, and can connect to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> with a compatible Matter hub. In Apple's ecosystem, that includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>.<br/>

GE is offering multiple width options up to 38 inches, in lengths up to 76 inches. GE says that the motor that powers the shades is "whisper quiet." An included magnetic rechargeable battery will last for up to six months before it needs to be recharged.<br/>
