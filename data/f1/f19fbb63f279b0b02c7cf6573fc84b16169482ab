<p>Marine Le Pen returned to a Paris court on Tuesday to open her appeal against a conviction for misusing European Parliament funds, a case that could determine whether she can run for France’s presidency in 2027. She was barred from standing for public office for five years, a sanction that would block a 2027 presidential candidacy unless overturned or altered on appeal. The hearing keeps the spotlight on how France’s courts handle high-stakes political cases—while offering a clear, rules-based process for voters to see accountability tested in open court.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/9SBHDiOyUJlghnydQL2fyX8dw9Br6D2AWxvzS6LJa-bUiSDS4gC85t9nVrWjjr9d2A2kXbbER8coH99vO9BDvvmYMRzLm0RH33ZUtZ2Ag7j-0D866LjUQX7DCwuZZAJNnYtQqstE21fn21D9OiF5oeOepaw9a7RbO-GxvEIFLHZ3i4CcUg' alt='Marine Le Pen at Jordan Bardella&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s address to the press, Paris, January 12, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Party succession: National Rally party leader Jordan Bardella said it would be “deeply worrying” for democracy if Le Pen were prevented from running, underscoring how closely the party’s strategy ties to her eligibility.</li><li>Case scope: The appeal concerns what several outlets describe as a long-running “fake jobs” arrangement involving European Parliament funds, with the original ruling portraying it as extensive and systematic rather than an isolated incident.</li><li>Defense approach: Le Pen has adjusted her appeal strategy compared with earlier phases, appearing to move away from outright denial of the underlying facts to seek more legal room to maneuver, according to analysis in Le Monde.</li><li>Immediate effect: Le Pen’s ban from holding elected office took immediate effect after the March ruling, making the appeal timeline central to whether she can realistically mount a 2027 campaign.</li></ul><blockquote>Deeply worrying - Jordan Bardella</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Marine Le Pen: She is asking the appeal court to overturn the ruling that found she misused European Parliament funds and barred her from office, because the outcome directly affects her ability to contest the 2027 presidential election.
