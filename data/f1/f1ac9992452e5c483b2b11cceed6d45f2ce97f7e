There were 1,961,596 total apps on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; at the end of 2024, up nearly 100,000 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/2023-app-store-transparency-report/">from last year</a>. The &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; sees 839,266,915 average weekly app downloads, and 813,110,348 average weekly visitors to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, with both metrics up compared to 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reviewed 7.77 million app submissions, and rejected 1.93 million of those. Performance, legal, design, business, and safety were the top reasons for rejection, in that order.<br/>
<br/>
Of the 1.93 million submissions that were rejected, 295,109 were approved after developers addressed the issue. Apple removed 82,509 apps from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; during the year, primarily in the Utilities and Games categories. Apps that were removed are broken down by the reason behind the action, with design issues and fraud at the top of the list.<br/>
