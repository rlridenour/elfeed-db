<p>Japan is holding a snap lower-house election on February 8. Opinion polls point to a decisive win for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s conservative coalition, even as record snowfall in parts of the country threatens to depress turnout and make travel to polling stations harder. The vote will fill all 465 seats in the House of Representatives. Several forecasts put the coalition above 300 seats—well beyond its current defense of 233—with some scenarios suggesting it could reach roughly 310 seats, enough for a two-thirds majority in the lower house. Takaichi, 64, became prime minister in October after winning the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership. She called the rare winter election to seek a clearer mandate for her agenda. Across reports, her priorities include conservative policy goals, higher defense spending, and economic steps such as stimulus and tax relief meant to ease pressure on household budgets. Analysts say a big win would give her more room to legislate, while warning that markets could balk at her fiscal commitments and the yen could come under pressure. Heavy snow has not stopped many voters from turning out, but the weather could still weigh on participation in some areas.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ufM191EJZMrX-hm8TnYawM1Sb9iewe6eIA__Vgky2nNlzOwTZD7Zgz4mecnsFY5SS0VsOmLn_Unkwmu2QzA5X_M6t_RPh5SiFnA2xOIKa978eSLULtzXsnzINslm6qSI5R0I84QwpGZLo2GH_OsiCVBS3Q9piShIsfVwTNgdun0pq1MzN8jc4a4kx00CNAd6icNwjEu70gmMOrkPX6Ng554QSSAWTlpH' alt='Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi campaigns in Tokyo ahead of the snap election.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Coalition makeup: Coverage describes Takaichi’s governing bloc as the LDP allied with the Japan Innovation Party (Ishin).</li><li>Leader profile: Reports describe Takaichi as Japan’s first woman prime minister, highlighting her straight-talking style and “hard worker” image, and noting her appeal among younger voters.</li><li>Leader vs party: Even with Takaichi polling well personally, some outlets note weaker public sentiment toward the long-dominant LDP—an undercurrent of uncertainty beneath the strong forecasts.</li><li>Economic/market watch: Analysts say investors are watching how far she goes on fiscal pledges and any consumption-tax-related moves, with warnings the yen could face renewed pressure.</li><li>Foreign policy line: Takaichi has campaigned on higher military spending to counter China, a stance that has drawn criticism from Beijing.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Sanae Takaichi and LDP leadership: Takaichi called a snap winter election to seek a stronger mandate to advance her conservative agenda after taking office in October.
