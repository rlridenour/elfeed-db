<p>A large overnight Russian assault on Kyiv on Friday left at least four people dead and dozens wounded after missiles and drones struck residential areas and critical infrastructure, Ukrainian officials said. Ukrainian leaders reported the attack used large numbers of drones and ballistic missiles — figures cited by officials include roughly 430 drones and 18 ballistic missiles — and that energy, rail and other infrastructure were targeted. Kyiv authorities and emergency services fought multiple fires and reported damage across the city, while Ukraine said it struck a Russian oil terminal in response and urged partners to supply more air-defence systems and interceptor missiles.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lBI5BIweXpxYbZz0gMScdpJUGJKSggmojBV-ACwZUjmhnu4aZ3eHVdzQlNnJTY5ZZtTdcZzTsdx3JDgsx9r6yizAxNF-hzez0XqRYlFQzpBWyumTQYN3IWP2K0iesJN8mgICwr3TitG5KbJNvvrTGE2IRsMSeqVuisSmu2jtfQ' alt='Damaged residential building in Kyiv after overnight strikes, November 14, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Utility outages: Kyiv’s mayor said heating stopped in at least two districts after the strikes, underscoring the immediate winter utilities risk for civilians</li><li>Diplomatic fallout: Debris from a struck missile reportedly hit the Azerbaijani embassy in Kyiv, reflecting damage that reached diplomatic sites and complicating foreign missions&#x27; operations</li><li>Wider geography: Officials reported that strikes were not confined to Kyiv and also affected areas in Kharkiv and Odesa regions, stretching emergency response across multiple fronts</li></ul><blockquote>This was a deliberately calculated attack aimed at causing maximum harm to people and civilian infrastructure. - Volodymyr Zelenskyy</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: He described the strikes as deliberately aimed at civilians and called for more air-defence systems and international measures to stop Moscow&#x27;s attacks.
