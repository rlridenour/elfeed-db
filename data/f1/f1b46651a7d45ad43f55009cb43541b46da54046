<p>Reuters, with a headline that truly could have come from The Onion, “Trump Threatens Washington Stadium Deal Unless NFL Team Readopts Redskins Name”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Sunday to interfere with
a deal to build a new football stadium in Washington, D.C., unless
the local NFL team, now known as the Commanders, changes its name
back to Redskins. The American football team dropped the name
Redskins in 2020 after decades of criticism that it was a racial
slur with links to the U.S. genocide of the Indigenous population.</p>

<p>Trump had called for a return to the name Redskins — and for the
Cleveland Guardians baseball team to once again adopt the name
Indians — on other occasions, but on Sunday he added that he may
take official action.</p>

<p>“I may put a restriction on them that if they don’t change the
name back to the original ‘Washington Redskins,’ and get rid of
the ridiculous moniker, ‘Washington Commanders,’ I won’t make a
deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington,” Trump said in a
post on his Truth Social platform.</p>

<p>The team moved from Washington to suburban Landover, Maryland, in
1997, but earlier this year reached an agreement with the local
District of Columbia government to return to the city with a new
stadium expected to open in 2030.</p>

<p>Trump has limited authority to intervene under the current
home-rule law governing federal oversight of the District of
Columbia, but he has raised the prospect of taking more control,
telling reporters in February, “I think we should take over
Washington, D.C.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be emphasized — and shame on Reuters for not doing so — that Trump can’t just “take control” of the District of Columbia. Per <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/">Article I, Section 8</a> of the Constitution, it’s Congressional authority that oversees the district, not the Executive branch.</p>

(“<em>Look at me, I’m a crazy old angry racist, not a creepy old pedophile!</em>”)</p>
