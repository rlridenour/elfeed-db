Saudia, the flag carrier airline of Saudi Arabia, now supports Apple's iPhone feature that makes it easier to share the location of AirTag-equipped baggage at airports, according to <a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/industries/travel-hospitality/saudia-enhances-baggage-recovery-with-new-feature-for-apple-users">local media</a>.<br/>

With iOS 18.2, Apple introduced a new Find My feature that lets you temporarily share the location of an AirTag-equipped item – such as a bag – with others, including participating airline staff, to help track it if it's lost or delayed.<br/>
<br/>
Users running iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, or macOS Sequoia 15.2 and later can generate a "Share Item Location" link in the Find My app. Recipients can view the item's location on a live-updating web map.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says it collaborated with airlines to enable private and secure access to these links. Only a small number of people can view each link, and airline staff must authenticate using an Apple ID or a verified partner email to gain access.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as customers find their item, location sharing is disabled. The owner can also stop sharing their location at any time, and the sharing link automatically expires after 7 days to ensure the privacy of passengers.<br/>

American Airlines rolled out support for the feature in February. Other airlines that also offer the feature include Delta, United, Air Canada, Virgin Atlantic, British Airways, Lufthansa, and more.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/saudi-arabia/">Saudi Arabia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/30/iphone-tracking-lost-baggage-saudia/">iPhone Feature for Tracking Lost Baggage Expands to Saudia Airlines</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-feature-for-tracking-lost-baggage-expands-to-saudia-airlines.2462475/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
