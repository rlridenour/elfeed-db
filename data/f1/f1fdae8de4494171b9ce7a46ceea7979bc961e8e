I was receiving the error &ldquo;We cannot play the video in this browser. Please try a different web browser.&rdquo; I noticed they worked in Chrome but not Firefox; in my experience this is because Firefox has some additional protections against non-free software that CHrome doesn&rsquo;t care about. I identified that my browser was missing some codecs checking youtube and spotting the red-boxes under &ldquo;what does this browser support?&rdquo;
Looking around I found this solution.
