<h3>New &#36;599 MacBook Could Launch This Year</h3><br/>
We've been hearing rumors of a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">low-cost MacBook powered by the A18 Pro chip</a> from the iPhone 16 Pro, and a new report indicates that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/new-12-9-inch-macbook-launch-this-year-599-price/">could come in at a price point as low as &#36;599</a>. The laptop will reportedly include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/new-12-9-inch-macbook-launch-this-year-599-price/">12.9-inch display</a>, slightly smaller than the 13.6-inch screen on the smaller MacBook Air models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/Low-Cost-MacBook-Feature-A18-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="2680" height="1508" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008940" /><br/>
The new MacBook would be a successor to the M1 MacBook Air from 2020, which continues to be an ultra low-cost option <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/macbook-air-with-m1-chip-599-at-walmart/">available only through Walmart for &#36;599</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Everything New in iOS 26 Beta 6</h3><br/>
Apple has moved to a one-week interval for iOS 26 beta releases, which means this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/ios-26-beta-6-features/">saw the release of iOS 26 beta 6</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005033" /><br/>
Apple is continuing to make changes to the upcoming update, such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/ios-26-gets-more-new-ringtones/">adding new ringtones</a>, faster and bouncier animations when opening and closing apps, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/ios-26-beta-6-liquid-glass-changes/">more tweaks to the Liquid Glass look</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26 should be released to the general public in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Will the iPhone 17 Cost More?</h3><br/>
As seems to be the case every year, rumors have been circulating about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/iphone-17-price-rumors/">potential price increases</a> coming with the launch of new flagship iPhones in September. The rumors have been split about whether we might see an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/09/iphone-17-higher-prices-likely-says-analyst/">across-the-board increase</a> on the order of &#36;50 or whether increases might be targeted at certain models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17-Pro-on-Desk-Centered-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010582" /><br/>
The latest rumor claims the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/iphone-17-pro-minimum-256gb-storage-up-from-128gb/">iPhone 17 Pro in particular will come with a &#36;50 increase</a> in its starting price to &#36;1,049 in the United States, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/iphone-17-pro-may-break-8-year-streak/">breaking an 8-year streak</a> of Apple holding the line on a &#36;999 price point for that model. A potential price increase could come with one benefit, however, and that is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/iphone-17-pro-minimum-256gb-storage-up-from-128gb/">doubled base storage of 256 GB</a>, matching a change Apple made as part of a price increase for the Pro Max model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-pricing/">a couple of years ago</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Blood Oxygen Feature Returns to All Apple Watches in U.S.</h3><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/apple-releases-ios-18-6-1/">released iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1</a> updates with one big change: the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/blood-oxygen-monitoring-returning-to-apple-watch/">Blood Oxygen feature is now re-enabled</a> on all Apple Watch models sold in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/08/Apple-Watch-Series-6-Blood-Oxygen-LEDs.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1015055" /><br/>
On the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the U.S., the feature now works by sending the sensor data to a paired iPhone for calculation, with the results viewable in the Respiratory section of the Health app.<br/>
<br/>
The feature had been unavailable on Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra models sold in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-online/">since mid-January 2024</a>, as a result of a U.S. International Trade Commission order connected to a patent infringement lawsuit <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/09/apple-masimo-apple-watch-lawsuit/">filed by health company Masimo</a>. <br/>
