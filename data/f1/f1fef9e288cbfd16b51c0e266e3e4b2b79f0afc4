<p>Great roundup from The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Nintendo told us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">very little in the official reveal of
the console in January</a>, now we know when the Switch 2 is
coming and how much it will cost at launch: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">June 5th and
$449.99</a>. We also have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">more hardware details and specs to
pore over</a>, like a 1080p, 120Hz 7.9-inch LCD screen, Joy-Con
controllers with mouse-like functions, 256GB of storage, and 4K
output via the dock.</p>

<p>Nintendo also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">cleared up the mysteries about the system’s “C”
button</a> with details about new GameChat features and a camera
accessory and confirmed that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">GameCube games are coming to
Nintendo Switch Online,</a> along with a dedicated controller.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Nintendo showed off a number of new games,
like a Switch 2 edition of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and the
exclusive Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are going to object to the pricing, but the world has changed (and inflated) since the original Switch debuted in 2017. What I love about all of these announcements is that they’re so focused on <em>fun</em>. Nintendo doesn’t just still have it, they’ve got it more than they ever have. Just wonderful news all around.</p>
