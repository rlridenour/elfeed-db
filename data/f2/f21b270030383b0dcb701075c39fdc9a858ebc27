Another image of the iPhone 17 Pro's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/02/iphone-17-pro-new-magsafe-design/">rumored new MagSafe design</a> has surfaced. Unfortunately, though, the image's quality is pretty low.<br/>

A user known as "UnclePan" on Chinese social media platform Weibo this week <a href="https://weibo.com/5367283758/PCIUckade">shared an image</a> of third-party MagSafe cases that are apparently for the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
On the iPhone 17 Pro cases, the MagSafe layout has changed slightly, with the magnets no longer forming a complete circle on those devices.<br/>
<br/>
On the regular iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air, however, the MagSafe design is unchanged compared to previous iPhone models.<br/>
<br/>
It has been rumored that the Apple logo on the back of the iPhone 17 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-planning-to-change-iphone-17-logo-placement/">will be positioned lower</a> than it is on previous iPhone models, as a result of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/26/iphone-17-pro-expected-features/">larger rear camera bump</a>. The new MagSafe design would ensure that the Apple logo remains fully visible when these devices are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/06/iphone-17-pro-renders-highlight-design-changes/">covered by an updated MagSafe case</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As always, the MagSafe outline will only be visible on cases, and not on the iPhones directly.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, "UnclePan" accurately leaked that the Apple Watch Series 7 would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/24/apple-watch-series-7-case-sizes-increase/">available in then-new 41mm and 45mm sizes</a>, but the account does not have a perfect track record. However, this particular rumor has been corroborated by other sources.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will likely announce the iPhone 17 series in just about six weeks from now.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/unclepan/">UnclePan</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/29/iphone-17-pro-alleged-magsafe-design/">Here&#039;s Another Look at the iPhone 17 Pro&#039;s Alleged New MagSafe Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-another-look-at-the-iphone-17-pros-alleged-new-magsafe-design.2462398/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
