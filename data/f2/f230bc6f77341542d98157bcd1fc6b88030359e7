<p>One thing I&rsquo;m realizing as I transition to vegan foods is the need to cook more often. 🥗</p>
<p>Most restaurants don&rsquo;t have a lot of vegan options (even here in NYC, it&rsquo;s kind of an &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; section on the menu, and dedicated vegan restaurants close down all the time), and vegan groceries are usually super-duper processed.</p>
<p>Looks like I&rsquo;ll need to get over my fear of food processors and blenders. But at the same time, a mental note for myself that everything takes time, and I won&rsquo;t just &ldquo;learn kung fu&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a life thing, not a week thing.</p>
