Apple shares opened at &#36;177.24 today, as the company's stock price has continued to drop since U.S. President Donald Trump last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/apple-stock-trump-tariffs/">announced steep new tariffs</a>. The tariffs will significantly impact Apple, which still assembles the majority of iPhones and many other devices in China, which is facing a 54% tariff starting April 9.<br/>
<br/>
About an hour into the trading session, however, Apple's stock briefly surged to as high as &#36;194.14, following <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-reverses-course-hassetts-142738704.html">reports</a> that the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs, in all countries except China. A spokesperson for the Trump administration later <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/04/07/white-house-says-fake-news-that-trump-is-considering-90-day-tariff-pause.html">described that claim as "fake news,"</a> resulting in Apple's stock plunging below &#36;180 again. As of writing, shares are trading around the &#36;181 mark.<br/>
<br/>
Many stocks have plummeted since Trump's announcement, amid fears of a prolonged trade war and economic downturn. Apple's stock price has dropped nearly 20% since closing at &#36;223.89 last Wednesday. Trump threatened China with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-threatens-additional-tariffs-china-terminates-talks-2025-04-07/">additional tariffs</a> today, adding to the uncertainty that has sent shockwaves through global markets.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to publicly comment on the tariffs, as customers fear that the price of iPhones and other devices <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/04/2300-dollar-iphone/">may eventually increase</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-stock-wild-morning/">Apple&#039;s Stock Had a Wild Morning</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-stock-had-a-wild-morning.2454898/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
