<p>Swiss investigators are examining whether a locked service/exit door contributed to the deadly New Year’s Eve fire at the Constellation bar in the resort of Crans-Montana, Switzerland. Jacques Moretti, a co-owner, told authorities the service door was locked from the inside during the blaze and said he forced it open, finding people behind it. Prosecutors have taken Moretti into custody, and he and co-owner Jessica Moretti are suspected of homicide in connection with the incident as the inquiry continues.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/FuTCNb5tpgmd88iAzVMRN7LuQKPHN2Ypg3sZUCfkiu54wDpeqSbAMbCjxvqWup9fcZK3DfvkbMATKZYXzWy2nPVck8FnXT81_LrKTHYsgEA00KLckSfaa8LBMh4r3qEJ_KhTK87-C0zhyEnuKrFcWmrnL9zc0brZYnPOSy0nlighXD3CiqtGClVeUtVpPXGHDXkMshPYMjNQwV5VZM1osv247cqKbxeQ6RTtxhS7hGyrkgcdD_m1-YsmN85JIvNoam8jOabtVPNnThA4NlqaZuc' alt='' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Owner’s account: Moretti told investigators he does not know why the fire-exit/service door was locked, a detail prosecutors will weigh as they assess possible responsibility.</li><li>Possible charges: Euronews reported prosecutors could face added complexity if they conclude the bar owner bears partial blame for the locked door.</li><li>Custody status: The Guardian reported Swiss prosecutors took Moretti into custody on Friday as the investigation into the deaths proceeded.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Jacques Moretti (co-owner): He told investigators the service door was locked from the inside, said he forced it open, and said he did not know why it was locked.
