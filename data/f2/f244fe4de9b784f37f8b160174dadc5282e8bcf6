From <em>Digital Trends</em>:<br/>
<blockquote>We love Sneaky Sasquatch and are excited that the 2-person RAC7 team has joined Apple to continue their work on it with us. We will continue to deliver a great experience for Apple Arcade players with hundreds of games from many of the best game developers in the world.</blockquote><br/>
RAC7 will become an internal game studio within Apple, and Apple purchased the company to help Sneaky Sasquatch continue to grow on &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;. Sneaky Sasquatch was one of the first games to launch on &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; when the service went live, and it has continued to be popular with subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already works with developers and game companies to create titles for &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;, but this is the company's first game studio acquisition. <em>Digital Trends</em> notes that Apple does not appear to be implementing a new gaming strategy, describing the RAC7 acquisition as a unique situation.<br/>
