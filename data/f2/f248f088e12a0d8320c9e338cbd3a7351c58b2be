Apple introduced the super thin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Air today, and <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera was able to test it out after Apple's event. He shared some initial thoughts, giving us a first look at the device in the real world.<br/>

Unsurprisingly, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air is indeed "Awe Dropping" at first touch just because it's so lightweight and thin in the hand despite the 6.5-inch display. Even though it's light, it still feels like a premium device, which is expected at the &#36;999 price point. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air is 5.6mm thick, which makes it the thinnest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to date, and it weighs 165 grams.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added a new 18-megapixel front-facing camera that has a square sensor, so you can get more into the field of view. It's useful for group selfies and video calls.<br/>
<br/>
There's a camera "plateau" at the back of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air for the single-lens 48-megapixel rear camera. According to Apple, that area holds the front-facing camera, rear-facing camera, and some other hardware, enabling the thin design. The frame is titanium, and Apple says it won't bend. The OLED display offers 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates.<br/>
<br/>
Other features include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, Camera Control, and an Action button.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added a custom N1 networking chip for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, a new C1X modem, and the A19 Pro chip to optimize battery life. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air battery lasts for up to 27 hours when watching videos, and you can extend that if you pay another &#36;99 for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> battery pack. The other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> models have longer battery life, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air does have a better battery than the prior-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Air will be available for pre-order this Friday, and it'll launch on the 19th.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-air-hands-on/">iPhone Air First Look: Apple&#039;s Thinnest iPhone Feels Premium</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-first-look-apples-thinnest-iphone-feels-premium.2465084/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
