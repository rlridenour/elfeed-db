Lord, hear my prayer.
</p>

 <p>
For saying that something needs to be done <br></br>
while refusing to do anything myself, <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Lord, have mercy.</i>
</p>

 <p>
For believing that cries of outrage <br></br>
were the same as acts of love,
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Lord, have mercy.</i>
</p>

 <p>
For letting my own ego keep me from <br></br>
reaching out to those with whom I disagree.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Lord, have mercy.</i>
</p>

 <p>
For pretending that loving humanity <br></br>
was the same as loving my neighbor,
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Lord, have mercy.</i>
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
