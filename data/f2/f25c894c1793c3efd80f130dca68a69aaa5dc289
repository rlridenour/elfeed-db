<p>In the latest development in Gaza ceasefire talks, Israeli authorities say forensic tests show that body parts transferred from Gaza by the International Committee of the Red Cross do not belong to either of the two remaining known deceased hostages, Israeli officer Ran Gvili or Thai national Sudthisak Rinthalak. The material, described by officials as &quot;findings&quot; or presumed remains, was handed over on Tuesday after Palestinian armed groups indicated they were returning one of the last two bodies held in the enclave. Israel’s national forensic institute concluded the remains did not match the two men, leaving their families still without confirmed access to their loved ones’ bodies. The handover comes as Israel, Hamas and other groups move toward completing the first phase of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that includes the return of both living hostages and the bodies of those killed in captivity or during earlier fighting.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/dHzW8YzOxm6iK6-REVG9uaJLNyNUYGEBOikaKhUJAB1lj63wucZczXeq_utM0MVtVXqfMr0QxaxBff3_ubBnU4iJ14akndB2pjtLqXuIT_kHPhel7MZ8VRSfVecZc6lp-KmHBaywi8lMl7_nEB6wuNG4R4LSH7S03LZdYdm4BNQt4WTD0tkr0OKLpVs9G3aEF9LLt5A' alt='Israeli security and medical teams transport remains received from Gaza to a forensic facility for identification.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Hostages identified: Israeli and Thai officials say the two deceased captives still unreturned are police officer Ran Gvili and Thai agricultural worker Sudthisak Rinthalak, whose bodies are believed to remain somewhere in Gaza.</li><li>Islamic Jihad role: The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which held Ran Gvili, has told media it is searching in northern Gaza to locate his body amid the widespread destruction from months of fighting.</li><li>Ceasefire phase: Completion of the first phase of the U.S.-mediated truce hinges in part on the return of all identified hostage remains, alongside earlier releases of living captives and Palestinian prisoners.</li><li>Police escort: Israeli police accompanied what they initially described as the coffin of a fallen hostage from the handover point to the national forensic centre before tests showed the contents did not match either missing captive.</li><li>Thai worker context: The presence of a Thai citizen among the last two deceased hostages highlights how foreign farm workers employed in Israeli agriculture were among those kidnapped in the October 7 attacks and later killed.</li></ul><blockquote>We will continue to act to bring back all our abductees and the bodies of the fallen for burial in Israel - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli government: Israeli officials stress that the forensic mismatch means the whereabouts of Ran Gvili and Sudthisak Rinthalak remain unknown and pledge to keep working to bring their bodies home for burial.
