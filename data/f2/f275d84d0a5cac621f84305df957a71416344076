<blockquote>
  <p>According to senior Indian officials cited in the report, Apple
flew five planes full of iPhones and other products from India and
China “in just three days during the final week of March.”</p>

<p>“Factories in India and China and other key locations had been
shipping products to the US in anticipation of the higher
tariffs,” <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/how-apple-flew-5-flights-full-of-iphones-from-india-and-china-in-3-days-to-beat-trump-tariffs/articleshow/120044321.cms">one source to The Times of India</a> said.</p>

<p>Apple currently assembles the entire iPhone 15 and iPhone 16
lineups in India as well as China. A 10% baseline tariff on all
imports into the United States kicked in on Saturday. On April 9,
the tariffs that Trump has falsely labeled as “reciprocal” will
kick in. This will raise the tariff rate on imports from China to
54% and imports from India to 27%.</p>

<p>By stockpiling as much inventory as possible in the United States,
Apple can delay the impact of the tariffs. It’s unclear just how
much inventory Apple has on hand in the US right now, but if
there’s one thing I know, it’s to never doubt Tim Cook’s supply
chain prowess.</p>
