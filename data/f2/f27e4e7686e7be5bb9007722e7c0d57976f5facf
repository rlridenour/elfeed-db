<p>If you didn&rsquo;t look at <a href="https://codelearn.me/2018/07/16/frontend-interview-discuss.html">Part 1</a> of this post please check it out.</p>
<h2 id="project-2">Project 2</h2>
<p>Given a news site and its admin area. In admin area there are many users. Each user can edit a news-post.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal</strong> is to make sure only one user can edit a post even if multiple users are visited the same news-post for editing. Users visited a news-post after the first user should see the &ldquo;someone else is editing the post&rdquo; message.</p>
<p><strong>More info about the project:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not a single page application</li>
<li>Backend part of the code already able to lock/unlock the post internally (we just need to call the function).</li>
<li>Backend developer can implement endpoints/services a candidate ask.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possible-flow">Possible flow:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Candidate usually come up with the idea to use Web Sockets. If so, you can ask candidate about how it should work.</p>
<ul>
<li>What message(s) should be send by web socket client to a server?</li>
<li>What answer should be send by web socket server so client can know that post is blocked?</li>
<li>How to make sure two users will not block the post?</li>
<li>When user leaves a post who should be the next &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of a post if multiple other users are on a post page?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have discussed all that possible implementations for web socket you can tell candidate that
&ldquo;<strong>unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have ability to setup web socket server on
our production and have to come up with something else</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something else is <strong>long polling</strong> technique which is basically periodic Ajax requests to a server.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frontend can have two Ajax requests sending by interval (one is to lock, another one is to check if locked)</li>
<li>Backend should receive the &ldquo;lock&rdquo; and lock the post <strong>TEMPORARY</strong>.</li>
<li>If no another &ldquo;lock&rdquo; request received by the same user we should unlock the post (temp record should be removed)</li>
<li>Lock the post when there is no &ldquo;lock&rdquo; on the post and mark that post is locked by a user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this project and the project from Part 1 will help you to understand more about your candidate.</p>
