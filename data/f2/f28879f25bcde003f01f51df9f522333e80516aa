Unless plans change, the new "voice mode" feature could be released as soon as this month – nearly a year after OpenAI began rolling out its own equivalent to users.<br/>
<br/>
The feature, which will be available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/claude/id6473753684">Claude iOS app</a> and likely elsehwhere, reportedly includes three voices named Airy, Mellow, and British-accented Buttery. <br/>
<br/>
Anthropic has previously said it is working on a voice mode for Claude, but it has not officially revealed a planned launch window or any other details. The feature was discovered in Anthropic's code by app researcher M1Astra.<br/>
<br/>
Anthropic recently launched a new feature for its Claude AI assistant called "Research," aimed at providing thorough, citation-supported answers by drawing from online sources and corporate customer data. The tool is Anthropic's answer to OpenAI's Deep Research, which debuted earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, Claude is gaining support for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Docs, enabling users to query and interact with their Google Workspace content for more efficient task and information management.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/anthropics-claude-ai-voice-mode-this-month/">Anthropic&#039;s Claude AI Chatbot Expected to Gain &#039;Voice Mode&#039; This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anthropics-claude-ai-chatbot-expected-to-gain-voice-mode-this-month.2455412/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
