<li>5 filters: Washable Pre-Filter, Okaysou Nanois-Filter, H13 True HEPA Filter, Honeycomb Activated Carbon Filter, and Cold Catalyst Filter</li>
<li>All of that combines to remove 99.97% of tiny bullshit from the air in your house</li>
<li>Can clean rooms up to 1,145 square feet</li>
<li>Pretty quiet</li>
<li>Is it Mac-compatible: So, I discussed the mild Mac resemblance in the write-up</li>
</ul><h1>Clean It Up</h1><p>So, when I first saw this air purifier…</p>

<p>…I thought, <em>Whoa, this thing looks like an enormous iPod Shuffle</em>! And then I thought, <em>Hey, maybe there’s something funny I could do with that</em>.</p>
<p>Some riff on ‘AirPod,’ perhaps? You know, because it’s an air purifier? One with 5 filters to gather 99.97% of air pollutants like dust, pollen, smoke, dander, hair, and various nasty odors? Oh, and did I mention it can do so <em>quietly</em>?</p>
<p>But then I looked at a picture of an old Shuffle…</p>

<p>…and I realized the resemblance isn’t as straightforward as I thought. In fact, what I was doing in my memory was superimposing the spinner-navigation-thing from the original iPod…</p>

<p>…onto the black Shuffle.</p>
<p>What’s the point of all this?</p>
<p>Not much!</p>
<p>Just giving you a peek behind the curtains of how the writing process works. Or, in this case, doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Anyway, I mostly covered why you should buy this thing. It cleans the air and it does so without making a bunch of noise. Maybe you want to keep things fresh when all the windows are shut tight to lock in the heat or air conditioning. Or maybe the morning sun is coming in just so to reveal how dusty your house is. Either way, this will help.</p>
<p>So get one. Unless you love eating nasty air.</p>
