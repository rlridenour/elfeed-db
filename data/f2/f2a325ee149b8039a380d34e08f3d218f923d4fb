Following &zwnj;CES 2026&zwnj;, we talk through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/08/ces-2026-productivity-gear-wireless-tvs/">this year's tech showcase</a>, which saw major announcements related to robotics, AI, and display technology, as well as plenty of new Apple accessories. We discuss some of our favorite products highlighted at the event, such as <a href="https://strada.tech">Strada</a> and the <a href="https://www.clicks.tech/powerkeyboard">Clicks Power Keyboard</a>.<br/>

Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/apple-creator-studio/">announced</a> a new bundle called "<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-creator-studio/">Apple Creator Studio</a>" that offers access to six creative apps, as well as exclusive AI features and content, as part of a single subscription. In the U.S., pricing is set at &#36;12.99 per month or &#36;129 per year. Six apps are included with the subscription:<ul><li>Final Cut Pro on the Mac and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a></li><br/>
<li>Logic Pro on the Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;</li><br/>
<li>Pixelmator Pro on the Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;</li><br/>
<li>Motion on the Mac</li><br/>
<li>Compressor on the Mac</li><br/>
<li>MainStage on the Mac</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
For college students, Apple Creator Studio costs &#36;2.99 per month or &#36;29.99 per year. If you set up Family Sharing, you can share an Apple Creator Studio subscription with up to five other family members with a linked Apple Account for free. <br/>
<br/>
Pixelmator Pro was previously only available on the Mac, but it is now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/13/pixelmator-pro-is-coming-to-ipad/">coming to the iPad</a>. Apple Creator Studio subscribers will receive access to exclusive AI features and premium content across not only the Final Cut Pro and Pixelmator Pro apps, but also the iWork apps Numbers, Pages, and Keynote, and the Freeform app later this year. <br/>
<br/>
Apple Creator Studio will be available through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> starting on Wednesday, January 28. Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage will each remain available for one-time purchase, and free versions of the Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and Freeform apps will continue to exist, but only Apple Creator Studio subscribers will receive access to some of the premium new AI features and content.<br/>
<br/>
In other news, Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-next-generation-siri/">released a statement</a> confirming that Google Gemini will power the next-generation version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/30/tim-cook-say-siri-revamp-on-track-for-next-year/">slated to launch later this year</a>, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/apple-siri-google-gemini-partnership/">was widely rumored</a>. After a considerable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">delay</a>, the new capabilities will deliver better understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to lean on Google's artificial intelligence technology should result in the revamped &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; being more capable and advanced than it otherwise would have been, as Gemini's large language model is significantly larger than Apple's own model. Apple and Google added that Gemini will help power not only <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/12/google-gemini-next-generation-siri/">a more personalized version of Siri</a>, but a range of future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features.<br/>
<br/>
The next-generation version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-intelligence-siri-spring-2026/">expected to be introduced with iOS 26.4</a>, which will likely be officially released to the public in March or April.<br/>
