The ESD420 can be attached to the back of a MagSafe-compatible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and connected using the appropriate cable, such as a USB-C to USB-C cable. It supports &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; video recording features that require an external SSD, such as 4K ProRes video recording.<br/>
<br/>
Transcend designed the SSD to be compact and portable, and it weighs 48 grams. Transcend says that it offers military-grade drop resistance so that it can withstand shocks and falls, and it is meant to match the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with gold and space gray color options available. Because there is a magnet inside, the SSD can also be attached to other magnetic surfaces for storage purposes.<br/>
<br/>
The ESD420 comes in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities. It supports read and write speeds of up to 2,000MB/s, and it comes formatted in the exFAT file system.
