<p>Here’s an illustrated follow-up regarding the absurdity of MacOS 26’s “looks like they’re rounded off like a child’s toy but actually they’re still rectangles with corners” windows. If you turn on always-visible scroll bars (which you should) and scroll to the bottom, they look like this:</p>

    alt = "Screenshot of the bottom right corner of a window in MacOS 26 showing a scroll bar thumb cut off by the rounded corner."

<p>(That’s Safari, which I think is a somewhat popular app.)</p>

<p>It would make more sense if we found out that the team behind redesigning the UI for MacOS 26 Tahoe was hired by Meta a year ago and deliberately sabotaged their work to make the Mac look clownish and amateur.</p>
