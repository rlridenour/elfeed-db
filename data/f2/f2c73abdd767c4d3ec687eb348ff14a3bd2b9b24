<p>That&#8217;s the question that should be kept in mind when doing social metaphysics, argues <a href="http://www.astaphilosophy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ásta</a> (Duke University) in a new article, &#8220;<a href="https://journalofsocialontology.org/index.php/jso/article/view/9018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critical Social Metaphysics: Metaphysics for Liberation and Social Science and Theory</a>&#8221; in the <em>Journal of Social Ontology</em>.</p>
<p>She writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I want us to keep front and center why we are talking about gender, race, disability, and other social categories. I want us to ask ourselves, for example, what we want a theory of gender for? Similarly for the other social categories we may be interested in&#8230; The concept of gender is a theoretical concept and the sex/gender distinction is a theoretical distinction that nevertheless applies to everyday phenomena&#8230; What do we want them for? My answer is that we use these sorts of concepts and distinctions to bring into focus phenomena in the world, especially phenomena that are unjust.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>One of the things that many feminists care about is patterns. There is a pattern to the distribution of resources in every corner of the world; there is a pattern to the violence that occurs every day; there is a pattern to the respect, the opportunities, and the wellbeing that people enjoy. Many of us feminists care about these patterns. We care about training ourselves to notice these patterns, we care about devising language and concepts to understand the explanations of these patterns and what keeps them in place; and we care about building tools to disrupt them and encourage other patterns that are more just. That is what a feminist like me wants the concept of gender for.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>When we are interested in gender, we can of course be interested in various things&#8230; But when we are interested in the metaphysics of gender our interest is more focused. We are interested in the question: what is gender? What is it to have a gender? We are enquiring into the nature of gender. But when we ask this fundamental and abstract question, we always should keep in mind why we are asking it; what we want a metaphysics of gender for. </em></p>
<p>Ásta notes that &#8220;what is the theory for?&#8221; is a question applied in various other domains:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The demand that we keep in mind what we want the theory for is not an eccentric demand. Philosophers working in many areas of philosophy will recognize it: What do you want your theory of natural laws to explain? What is a theory of moral motivation to account for?</em></p>
<p>When it comes to gender, her primary example in the article, she says, &#8220;I want a theory of gender that can play a role in explaining certain patterns and phenomena that we observe.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is a good methodology for determining that theory? It&#8217;s not, for example, &#8220;analyzing, via introspection, the concept of gender.&#8221; That may simply take for granted popular &#8220;<span class="">gender practices and the content of the ideology those practices </span><span class="">express.&#8221; We need an approach that can &#8220;</span><span class="">illuminate our gender practices and the content of the ideology those practices </span><span class="">express&#8221; and &#8220;also illuminate them as ideology.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to read the article for the details on her proposed method.</p>
<p>One reason I&#8217;m drawing attention to the article is that it is helpful in illuminating a basic methodological divide in how to do metaphysics which seems at the heart of certain recent controversial debates. That divide could be characterized as being over whether or not to accept both of the following two ideas. First, as Ásta puts it, that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>metaphysics is unavoidably value laden in this specific sense: guiding us are the values regarding what needs to be explained and what is relevant to that explanation</em></p>
<p>and second, which we can borrow from years of discussion in philosophy of science (see, for example <a href="https://upittpress.org/books/9780822960263/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/values-in-science/8C9899A25764AA9A791287325A511C3C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>), that those values are not merely epistemic values.</p>
