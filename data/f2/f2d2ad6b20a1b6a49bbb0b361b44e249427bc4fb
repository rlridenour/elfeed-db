<p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>I already have a post about <a href="https://codelearn.me/2018/02/19/gdb-dashboard.html">GDB Dashboard</a> package which is cool but I&rsquo;ve just found somethine even better.</p>
<p>Meet <a href="https://github.com/longld/peda">PEDA</a>. It looks really awesome. I wasn&rsquo;t able to try all the commands
it provides but the interface looks pretty awesome.</p>
<p>It shows stask in realtime which Dashboard package lack. Not just showing addresses but also strings
if any of them are on the address.</p>
<p>Now my GDB looks like debuggers I have used to before like OllyDbg.</p>
<p>If you use GDB a lot especially for software exploring you have to try the PEDA package.</p>
<p>Here is screenshot from their repo.</p>
