<p>President Trump instructed the Pentagon to begin &quot;testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; a directive that signals a possible end to a decades-long pause on U.S. explosive nuclear testing and has prompted international concern . U.S. national laboratories and defense officials already use extensive simulations and non‑explosive stewardship programs to evaluate warheads, and several experts say there is no scientific need for new full-yield explosive tests . The announcement touched off alarm among analysts and foreign governments worried it could weaken long-standing arms-control norms and increase geopolitical tensions .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/GMaD2Q24p4XhaxGK489u3AzjrkOJIwMtwdGvGqXpiUTa2bXbWXHP99xqzOm9pJAE53goyxtkKWIalQDn9wOlhHWIDIO_DfEMAHHL5MVHC4fXBxp3bReh2gv2lkL-vpzxPl4CzDTRILrx5eIuLZcVC34u9aeyH2JIXQmTBOkp_fEVVq7Q9XxEPcGzCcj_VpxyFGzM' alt='The tower for Icecap, a nuclear test that was nearly ready to execute but never happened because of the testing moratorium enacted on Oct. 1, 1992, at the Nevada National Security Site.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Simulation capacity: Powerful supercomputers and the U.S. stockpile stewardship program can simulate warhead performance, a capability experts say reduces the technical need for explosive tests</li><li>Testing ambiguity: Analysts note Trump&#x27;s order is ambiguous — it could mean flight or delivery-system tests rather than explosive yield tests, leaving open multiple technical interpretations</li><li>Domestic politics: The decision deepened partisan divisions in Congress, with some lawmakers warning it risks national security and others framing it as a response to perceived Russian and Chinese advances</li><li>Practical hurdles: Experts say re-establishing explosive testing would require years of planning and environmental review, and Russia has warned it would &quot;act accordingly&quot; if the moratorium were broken</li></ul><blockquote>Start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. - President Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He ordered the Pentagon to &quot;start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,&quot; framing the move as a response to other countries&#x27; activities in the nuclear sphere .
