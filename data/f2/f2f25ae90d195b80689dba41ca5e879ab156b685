<h2 id="md-capture">md-capture</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pdxmph/md-capture" target="_blank">md-capture</a> is a package which lets me capture information to a Markdown file like org-capture. Okay, not fully like org-capture with all of its options, but a reasonable solution in the Markdown world.</p>
<pre><code>;; markdown-capture
(use-package md-capture
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/elisp/md-capture.el"
  :commands (md-capture)
  :init
  (setq md-capture-targets '("~/Dropbox/org/markdown files/inbox.md")))</code></pre>
<h2 id="buffer-terminator">buffer terminator</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/buffer-terminator.el" target="_blank">Buffer-Terminator</a> is a newish package.</p>
<p>At any given point, I have a couple of hundred buffers open in Emacs. In other words, I open a buffer and never kill it. Any buffer I open, stays open. That leads to a state where I get a whole bunch of open buffers. And the list of open buffers keeps growing. It is not a strain on the computer or the program, but it seemed inelegant. Buffer-terminator solves that problem. It automatically kills buffers when you don’t access them for a while. Much neater approach.</p>
<p>You can always use consult-buffer to search through your buffers. I have been trying this for a while and I like it.</p>
<pre><code>(use-package buffer-terminator
  :ensure t
  :custom
  (buffer-terminator-verbose nil)
  (buffer-terminator-inactivity-timeout (* 30 60)) ; 30 minutes
  (buffer-terminator-interval (* 10 60)) ; 10 minutes
  :config
  (buffer-terminator-mode 1)
(setq buffer-terminator-rules-alist
      (keep-buffer-property . visible)
      (kill-buffer-property . inactive)))</code></pre>
<h2 id="save-your-tab-sets">Save Your Tab-sets</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/localauthor/tab-sets" target="_blank">Tab-sets</a> lets you save a set of tabs. Depending on the project I am working on, it makes sense to have a different set of open tabs leading to particular files relevant to that project. Tab-sets lets me set this up.</p>
<pre><code>;; tab-sets
;; https://github.com/localauthor/tab-sets
(use-package tab-sets
  :ensure nil
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/localauthor/tab-sets")
  :custom
  (tab-sets-data-file "~/.emacs.d/tab-sets.eld")
  :config
  (tab-sets-setup-embark))</code></pre>
<h2 id="denote">Denote</h2>
<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote" target="_blank">Denote</a> package in Emacs to write. All of my notes, blog-posts, associated scribbling happens in Emacs with Denote. Denote is at its base a file naming convention. Makes it easy to name your files and keeps them searchable. Denote has the ability to handle org files, markdown files, and plain text files. You have the option of choosing a default format, and mine is org-files.</p>
<p>The problem is <a href="https://blot.im" target="_blank">blot</a>, my blogging platform doesn’t deal with org-files, it only deals with Markdown files. I thus have a mix of org files, Markdown files and plain text scribbles in my notes/writing folder.</p>
<p>I like keeping files in silos. What that means is that I have sub-folders in the main notes/org folder for my organizational needs. The notes in org-mode are all contained in the base folder. I have sub-folders for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book I am writing on macOS.</li>
<li>Book I am writing on Emacs. (This is a dream of mine. I am far away from realizing it).</li>
<li>Posts for the blog.</li>
<li>Inbox to quickly capture ephemeral notes.</li>
<li>Folder containing assorted Markdown files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is twofold, the usual denote command:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically puts all its files in the main org folder.</li>
<li>Denote also defines the extension as org as that is what I have set as default.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to have options. I want the ability to make new files as org-files and save them in the main org folder. In addition, I want the ability to create files which get saved in one of the sub-folders. I also want control over the file-type when I create and save files in these sub-folders.</p>
<p>Denote is well-designed. Prot is brilliant. It lets me do that. I have the usual denote command, it lets me make org files saved in the main org folder. I added this bit of code to let me have an option to choose both the type of file and the location of the file when I don’t want the default behavior.</p>
<pre><code>(defun my/denote-create-note ()
  "Create a denote note with file type selection."
  (interactive)
  (let ((file-type (completing-read "File type: " 
                                    '("org" "markdown-yaml" "text"))))
    (let ((denote-file-type file-type))
      (call-interactively #'denote-subdirectory))))
;; Bind to a key
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n n") #'my/denote-create-note)</code></pre>
<p>I am sure there are more elegant ways of achieving this, but this works.</p>
<p>Howard Melman improved my function with this iteration:</p>
<pre><code>(defun my/denote-create-note ()
 "Create a denote note with file type selection."
 (interactive)
 (let ((denote-file-type (completing-read "File type: " '("org" "markdown-yaml" "text"))))
   (call-interactively #'denote-subdirectory)))</code></pre>
<p>Brilliant. Elegant and saves me from the sin of “nested lets.”</p>
