<p>President Trump said he would impose 200% tariffs on French wine and Champagne after learning that French President Emmanuel Macron intends to decline an invitation to join a US-led “Board of Peace” initiative. The proposed body is described as beginning with Gaza-related work and then expanding to other conflicts, but it has also raised questions among diplomats about how it would interact with existing international mechanisms such as the United Nations. Macron’s camp criticized the use of tariff threats to influence foreign policy, while the Kremlin said it is examining details of the invitation extended to President Vladimir Putin.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/0OQmQvv5_wBuD_Kd5IClmw18aD6zTsv9Ht2frrI8Fg7rch4feWNuYaJLIzckLOr8DVeF97WkUUXtCQUy8ZTRcVoNUQ0oykZAkHJKaWnL3vERvtMgdRZKVxnlIDgtSert45GrlMUCF91zzF9IdYiQfHzHnJb84yIu6-2Uyqtl_Uf04cWVJg' alt='Donald Trump speaks to reporters at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, January 19, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Draft charter: A draft charter for the Board of Peace was sent to about 60 nations and calls for members to contribute $1 billion in cash to keep membership beyond three years, according to a document cited in reporting.</li><li>Davos push: Bloomberg reported that President Trump wants the board’s constitution and remit finalized at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.</li><li>Who was invited: Reporting said invitations went to a wide range of leaders, including Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Belarus’ Alexander Lukashenko.</li><li>France’s concern: A source close to Macron said France’s refusal was driven by concerns about the board’s powers and scope, with the initiative chaired by President Trump.</li><li>Kremlin response: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow is studying the invitation and will seek clarity on “all the nuances” through contacts with the US.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>US administration (President Trump): President Trump presented the tariff threat as leverage to encourage Macron to join the Board of Peace, while also saying Macron does not have to join.
