Apple is working on a new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> with an OLED display, a hole punch camera, and touch screen functionality, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-16/apple-readies-high-end-macbook-pro-with-touch-hole-punch-screen">Bloomberg</a></em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said today. The updated &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is set to launch sometime between late 2026 and early 2027.<br/>

Apple hasn't redesigned the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; since the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/">M1 Max</a> machines in 2021, but that is set to change with the launch of the OLED models. Along with new display capabilities, there will be a hole-punch camera and no notch, plus a thinner and lighter design. Apple is also adding a reinforced hinge and an updated screen design that will ensure the display does not move when it is touched.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple plans to add a touch screen, the MacBook will continue to have a trackpad and a keyboard, with touch gestures augmenting existing functionality.<br/>
<br/>
With an OLED display and touch integration, the upcoming 2026/2027 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models will likely be more expensive than the current higher-end &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models that are priced starting at &#36;1,999 for the 14-inch model and &#36;2,499 for the 16-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
The touch screen &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models will be equipped with Apple's next-generation M6 chips. Apple just this week debuted the M5 Apple silicon chip, so the M6 is a ways off. Apple won't have M5 Pro and M5 Max chips ready until early 2026, which means it is increasingly likely the M6 variants will come in 2027.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that Apple will introduce two &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; refreshes in the same year, but it would be unusual.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to test touch screen Macs with the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; line, and the technology won't come to other Macs until Apple learns how it fares with consumers. Apple's last attempt at touch-based functionality in the Mac did not go well. The Touch Bar that was added to the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; in 2016 did not prove popular with customers, and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/touch-bar-discontinued/">ended up phasing</a> it out starting with the 2021 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; refresh.<br/>

Rumors about a touch screen Mac surfaced earlier this year when Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that Apple would incorporate on-cell touch technology in the OLED &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;. Kuo said that Apple decided to give the Mac a touch screen after "long-term observation of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> user behavior" that suggested touch controls can enhance productivity and user experience in certain scenarios.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/macbook-pro-oled-touch-screen/">MacBook Pro With OLED Touch Screen Launching as Soon as 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-pro-with-oled-touch-screen-launching-as-soon-as-2026.2469255/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
