<p>Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te has announced a special defense package worth about $40 billion that his government will submit to the legislature as a supplementary budget, mainly to fund new arms purchases from the United States in response to growing military pressure from China. Lai framed the move as essential to protecting Taiwan’s sovereignty, freedom and democratic system, saying there can be no compromise on national security as Beijing steps up military flights, naval activity and espionage around the island. The government says the funds will significantly enhance Taiwan’s “asymmetric” defense, including systems designed to make any attack costly and difficult, and are part of a broader plan to reach a higher level of combat readiness by 2027. Chinese officials condemned the plan as wasteful and dangerous, accusing Taipei of following “external forces” and warning that more weapons will not bring safety, while Taiwan argues that stronger self-defense capabilities can help maintain peace and stability in the region.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/-Z5MO7Az3tp-C0Nyt7KqF6ANFmiQyHECQkDUemiCPyx6D-5Nu7Hy-lZ-1t3E1ITs0UpFBDweOlgnNY84Mbab1LIFfsWUiS8gWxRbaLoC-WIp' alt='Taiwan President Lai Ching-te speaks at a press conference on defense spending in Taipei.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Budget structure: Taiwan’s special defense package of T$1.25 trillion is separate from its regular military budget and will be spread over several years to finance specific procurement programs rather than routine spending.</li><li>U.S. arms focus: Officials say the money will cover a range of U.S.-made systems, including advanced air and missile defenses and other platforms intended to complicate any Chinese assault and protect critical infrastructure.</li><li>Taiwan Dome plan: Part of the budget will fund the so‑called Taiwan Dome, an integrated air defense network with high‑end detection and interception capabilities aimed at creating a protective “shield” over the island.</li><li>Rising defense share: Taipei plans to lift annual defense spending to about 3.32% of GDP in 2026, and President Lai has previously said he wants to move toward roughly 5% by 2030 in line with calls from Washington for greater burden sharing.</li><li>Signal to Washington: The package is described as Taiwan’s largest special defense budget in three decades and is intended in part to show President Trump’s administration that Taipei is prepared to pay more toward its own security as it seeks continued U.S. support.</li></ul><blockquote>There is no room for compromise on national security - Lai Ching-te</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Taiwanese government: President Lai argues the package is a “landmark” step to defend a democratic Taiwan, emphasizing that the choice is between safeguarding self-rule or being turned into “China’s Taiwan” and insisting that investing in deterrence is the best way to preserve peace.
