<p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Thursday as London and Beijing moved to stabilise a relationship Starmer said had been stuck in an “ice age”. Both leaders framed the talks as an effort to expand practical cooperation while keeping space for frank disagreement, with Starmer describing China as “a vital player on the global stage” and Xi urging the two sides to “rise above differences” after years of “twists and turns”. The most tangible outcome highlighted in the reporting was China’s agreement to grant UK citizens visa-free short stays of up to 30 days, alongside a new services-focused partnership meant to help British firms operate in China. Starmer also said the sides made progress on reducing tariffs affecting Scotch whisky and agreed to cooperate on issues such as food and product standards and information exchange on irregular migration, presenting the reset as an economic win aimed at supporting jobs and growth at home. The outreach is unfolding amid wider geopolitical uncertainty, with multiple outlets noting that European leaders have increased engagement with Beijing as they hedge against unpredictability from the United States under President Donald Trump. At the same time, Starmer’s openness to a possible future UK visit by Xi drew criticism from UK politicians who cite concerns about espionage allegations and human rights, underscoring that any warming will remain politically contested.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/5TlPRy6R1owb6O3YJHOsoPdVAGbfAKaQ41W2d82D2eKVvgotxaejUwWU-cTK65v9xH-Yyx9LvxqSjWO1XaKvLMVLo5RR9bp8629Kgf53Mqa2TTPN6qmWY-sfWzYt_xXN8GrRP1nmb8EG2px_VDolEq1mR7GR1iLGVfjUFUI5Du4GBPFHke6ckuBdC8NIGhyx9zGz2P6AYCtBPTS7Sthf9nJsBuAjA0UXEJEW3-dmUBOgk2MYrtSXy0gnx5MdOioEEVgWEjc84hP1Nguw1Q' alt='Britain&#x27;s Prime Minister Keir Starmer shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Thursday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Services pact: The UK and China announced a services partnership covering areas such as healthcare, financial and professional services, legal services, and education/skills, and they agreed to run a feasibility study on a potential bilateral services agreement with legally binding rules for firms.</li><li>Whisky tariffs: Downing Street said China agreed to halve tariffs on Scotch whisky, restoring the rate to where it was a year earlier.</li><li>Hong Kong mention: Starmer said he raised Hong Kong’s stability and the national security trial of jailed media figure Jimmy Lai in his meeting with Xi, according to reporting on the readouts and his comments to journalists.</li><li>Migration cooperation: Starmer said the two sides discussed information exchange and cooperation on irregular migration, including a focus on “small boats and engine parts”.</li><li>Diplomatic tone: Starmer said he and Xi even talked “soccer and Shakespeare,” an example he offered of a warmer tone alongside business discussions.</li></ul><blockquote>China is a vital player on the global stage, and it’s vital that we build a more sophisticated relationship where we can identify opportunities to collaborate, but of course, also allow a meaningful dialogue on areas where we disagree, - Keir Starmer</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>UK government (Starmer/Downing Street): Starmer portrayed the visit as a pragmatic reset aimed at growth and security, combining business openings (including easier travel) with space for “meaningful dialogue” on disagreements.
