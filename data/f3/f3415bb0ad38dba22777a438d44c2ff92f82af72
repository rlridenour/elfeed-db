<p>The U.N. COP30 climate conference opened in Belém, Brazil, on November 10 and runs through November 21 as the United States is notably absent after President Trump decided not to send a delegation. Brazil, holding the rotating presidency, framed the summit as a return to the Rio-era focus on vulnerable groups and the Amazon and asked parties to act on past promises rather than make new ones. Analysts and some officials say the absence of the U.S. creates space for BRICS and China to take a more visible role on mitigation and finance, while the European Union faces heavier diplomatic pressure to lead for wealthy countries despite domestic political strains.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/oe_qtBxJLa903rhTpiLsFf5MpL_I7Yr2lefAebH3x5K0maKTeOhc49C-2cueSpB4yayoDHX6pguuxC7RlyiZ0V2SAeso9Lnj16I_GLPVExskwqH41nWy3rEDTkSma6_6QKgPx8hp-pEknWH0IrIud2HDqsCwJtnHuiYIvniQo3NSLiFst_DRTa5uYSbIJORiqHJJ29_XtQEfRg' alt='The U.N. climate conference is being held in Belém, Brazil.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>BRICS role: Brazilian analysts and commentators say BRICS countries could drive the debate and propose practical actions at COP30 in Washington’s absence.</li><li>European strain: EU officials arrive in Belém under pressure to act as the lead wealthy-country interlocutor even as some member states have weakened domestic green policies, complicating diplomatic leverage.</li><li>Business turnout: Several major global companies scaled back or limited their delegations, creating a muted corporate presence with more Latin American and Brazilian business representation expected.</li><li>Host priorities: Brazil’s presidency emphasised implementing past COP promises, giving space to indigenous groups and spotlighting Amazon protections rather than opening new large pledges.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>European Union: EU climate officials say the bloc is committed to stepping up leadership and urging other countries to increase ambition despite domestic debates over the green transition.
