<p>Israeli authorities have confirmed that remains handed over this week by Palestinian armed groups in Gaza are those of Sudthisak Rinthalak, a Thai agricultural worker who was abducted from Israel during the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack and later killed. His body was transferred to Israel via the International Committee of the Red Cross under the terms of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that requires militants to return both living captives and the bodies of hostages taken from Israel. Thailand’s government said Israel formally notified it that the remains were identified as Thai, and plans are underway to repatriate Rinthalak so his family in northeastern Thailand can hold funeral rites. With this identification, all known Thai hostages have now been accounted for, while the remains of one Israeli hostage, officer Ran Gvili, are still believed to be in Gaza.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/b508zZh6kjLqbzVlTa1dnH1cqXFjJ8uPuLTQG5p33YME3QSUZaM7Kma1lPXPNthRczcxtqa-TzABJ8ee4pwSg3q2Eys2MZZW3FIADrE5d7Rip29S3j-pmPrOPUtn3_aG0iP06MXDkxiYtsjDZkasc5hOrACr3DAFoPVXwruqOmu4kofA-sQlbTwlGZ49fYhbHszxoA' alt='Placards bearing the image of Thai hostage Sudthisak Rinthalak displayed during a rally in Tel Aviv calling for the return of all hostages’ remains from Gaza.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Ceasefire framework: Under the first phase of the U.S.-mediated ceasefire, Palestinian militants in Gaza were obligated to hand over all 48 remaining hostages they held, including both survivors and those who had died in captivity or during the October 7 attack.</li><li>Hostage numbers: Since the current truce started in early October, Israel has received 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others, leaving only the body of Israeli hostage Ran Gvili still to be returned from Gaza according to Israeli officials.</li><li>Thai workers in Israel: Rinthalak was one of 31 Thai nationals seized while working on farms in southern Israel during the October 2023 attack, reflecting Thailand’s large community of migrant agricultural laborers in the country.</li><li>Family circumstances: Friends and Thai officials described Rinthalak as a hard‑working breadwinner who had travelled to Israel to support his family financially after a divorce and to &quot;find himself&quot; through overseas work.</li><li>Ongoing dispute: Israeli authorities have accused Hamas and allied groups of delaying the return of some bodies, including that of Ran Gvili, despite ceasefire commitments to transfer all remaining hostage remains.</li></ul><blockquote>He went to Israel to work and to find himself after the divorce - Thanasak Saengpchan, friend of Sudthisak Rinthalak</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Israel: Israel’s prime minister’s office announced that forensic examination identified the remains received as those of Thai national Sudthisak Rinthalak and stated that only the body of Israeli hostage Ran Gvili still has not been returned from Gaza under the ceasefire arrangements.
