<p>A mass shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School in the remote community of Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, killed 10 people — including the suspected shooter — and sent dozens for medical care Tuesday afternoon, Canadian police said. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said officers responded around 1:20 p.m. local time, issued a localized emergency alert telling residents to shelter in place, and later found the suspected attacker dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted injury. Authorities said six victims were found dead inside the school. Another person died while being transported to hospital, and police later found two more bodies at a nearby residence they believe is connected to the incident. More than 25 people were reported injured, including two with life-threatening injuries, as investigators worked to secure the scenes and determine a motive. Officials said the immediate danger to the public had passed after officers found the suspect dead.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fNpBYxDHi9SUWEGhvvU-Iw5_sQH5F6Yfjea1zxQDwVqrK5FPrf3zp1yT_6ZsXyTIX2ZEd95lNC_vz3-bJGC99nV2jKkEapliApvPDoZUfPpXfrBgjRs5VR1RxTPn4A3IyELDUfCCEMXop9xWCI0IVDP9gOZDmU5o5DpD-1uRBywx7cNr6BfkqkknNO-RUmqGpL3iH6A1fc5qVkVaT6u1qiKCNQdqF6GdwzMcm9L55IwXOHT8qNeL8uIE4G13fw' alt='' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Injury toll (detail): The RCMP later said 27 people were wounded.
