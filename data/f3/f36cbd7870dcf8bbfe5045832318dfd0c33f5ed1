<p>Venezuela’s National Assembly has approved, and acting President Delcy Rodríguez has signed, a sweeping overhaul of the country’s hydrocarbons law that reduces state control and creates a clearer path for private and foreign companies to participate more directly in oil production and sales. The package is designed to attract investment by changing fiscal terms and governance—an acknowledgment that Venezuela needs fresh capital and operational capacity to revive output. The shift also lands in a fraught political moment. Several outlets describe the reform as coming amid U.S. pressure and a thaw in some commercial ties, while also linking it to recent security and leadership upheaval inside Venezuela. For global readers, the near-term question is whether the new rules will be stable enough—and open enough—to bring sustained investment, jobs, and more predictable oil trade flows.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/XJr73Z2eiqdD3bJWHv6Io6hTTfKRuUM5pfvzIGFpKTnKVQ5hvahDP2edJFpRu5LTlxzpB8XOjKGhzGCn6vDvaMlREvWQE4ngt785e7sWVGVVwT7SCUhSIopU58rEuZ_2AqOfDsSH4bqYb-yEMgSdED1HpgbcsA9OeEHzcsLB0Jv0IpD7LZSpZkAsulS5ff0NsQdaeSsuA4gPjS0c5mH2_jze_oGqm8OAPyz-YJQ' alt='Venezuela’s National Assembly votes on the hydrocarbons law reform in Caracas, Jan. 29, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tax terms: Lawmakers modified the proposal to lower taxes as part of the final package, aiming to make projects more financially viable for operators.</li><li>Operator autonomy: The reform is expected to grant private producers greater operational autonomy and to allow asset transfers and outsourcing arrangements that were harder under prior rules.</li><li>Dispute process: The new law includes provisions for independent arbitration of disputes, a feature often sought by international investors before committing capital.</li><li>Scope of control: Despite the opening, reporting notes the state would still retain a significant role in the sector, and analysts question whether the changes go far enough to satisfy U.S. expectations.</li><li>US ties: One account says Washington has lifted restrictions on crude trade and resumed commercial flights, framing the reform within a broader normalization of commercial relations.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Venezuela’s government/acting presidency: Officials present the overhaul as a way to ease state control and lure investors into rebuilding the oil industry through a new legal framework.
