<p>The guides are intended to provide useful advice about engaging in public philosophy.</p>
<p>Some of the guides cover subfields of philosophy, such as philosophy of science and aesthetics. Others are about specific topics, like food and migration. And yet others are about types of public engagement, such as podcasts, community events, or philosophy with children.</p>
<p>The guides are free and available <a href="https://www.publicphilosophynetwork.net/guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The series is edited by <a href="https://ianolasov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ian Olasov</a> and <a href="https://jeanneproust.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeanne Proust</a>. They are currently accepting proposals for new guides.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/10/07/new-guides-to-public-philosophy/">New: Guides to Public Philosophy</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
