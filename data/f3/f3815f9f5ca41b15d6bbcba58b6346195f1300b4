With the design overhaul that's coming this year, Apple plans to rename all of its operating systems, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/apple-to-rebrand-device-operating-systems-ios-26-macos-26-watchos-26">Bloomberg</a></em>. Going forward, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS will be identified by year, rather than by version number. We're not going to be getting iOS 19, we're getting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a>.<br/>

&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; will be accompanied by iPadOS 26, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS 26</a>, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26 instead of iPadOS 19, macOS 16, tvOS 19, watchOS 12, and visionOS 3.<br/>
<br/>
Changing the name of the operating systems will introduce consistency across the lineup, rather than having several disparate numbers that don't match up. Apple is using vehicle-style numbering for operating systems and choosing the number of the upcoming year, so it'll be &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; instead of iOS 25 because the update will be available across both 2025 and 2026.<br/>
<br/>
The names will reflect a new effort by Apple to provide a more unified design across operating systems on different devices. The refreshed visionOS-like design update is coming to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.<br/>

Apple plans to announce the new naming scheme at the Worldwide Developers Conference that's set to begin on Monday, June 9.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/">No iOS 19: Apple Going Straight to iOS 26</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/no-ios-19-apple-going-straight-to-ios-26.2457838/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
