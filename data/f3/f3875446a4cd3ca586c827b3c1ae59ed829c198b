Apple will launch the iPad mini 8 with OLED display in the third quarter of next year at the earliest, according to Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/QfDAZ44qp">Instant Digital</a>.<br/>

Today's claim from the Chinese social media account broadly aligns with reports from <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/apple-ipad-macbook-oled-displays/">Bloomberg</a></em> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-plans-to-bring-oled-to-nine-new-devices/">Korean</a> <a href="https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/092/0002332359">media</a> indicating the iPad mini will get an OLED display as soon as 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Corroborating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/apple-ipad-macbook-oled-displays/">previous rumors</a>, Instant Digital says Apple will make the iPad mini the second model in its iPad lineup to adopt OLED display technology, followed by the iPad Air – likely in 2027 at the earliest. Currently, OLED panels are exclusive to iPad Pro models. <br/>
<br/>
OLED panels can individually control each pixel, resulting in more precise color reproduction and deeper blacks compared to other common display technologies. They also provide superior contrast, faster response times, better viewing angles, and greater design flexibility.<br/>
<br/>
For the iPad mini 8, Apple is likely to use the mid-tier A19 Pro chip found in the iPhone Air. Apple built the A19 Pro chip on an upgraded third-generation 3-nanometer N3P process for modest speed and efficiency improvements. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is reportedly working to give the iPad mini 8 a more <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/ipad-mini-water-resistance/">water-resistant design</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman. To achieve this, Apple is said to have designed a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/29/ipad-mini-8-vibration-speakers/">vibration-based speaker system</a> that eliminates the need for traditional speaker holes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's ‌iPad mini‌ with OLED display technology and improved water resistance is expected to be more expensive, and Apple could charge up to &#36;100 more for the device, according to Gurman. The ‌iPad mini‌ is currently priced starting at &#36;499.<br/>
