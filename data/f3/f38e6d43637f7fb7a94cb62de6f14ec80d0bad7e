<p>The prize announcement states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span dir="ltr" lang="EN-GB">Prof. Dr. Ingrid Robeyns investigates how justice, wealth and well-being can be distributed more fairly. Combining philosophy, economics and political theory, her work advocates ‘limitarianism’&#8212;the idea that extreme personal wealth is morally and socially harmful. She argues for an upper limit on wealth and develops policy proposals to support it. Her excellent research provides concrete solutions to inequality and the institutions of our social contract, as well as the challenges posed by democratic decline. Through her sharp analysis, organisational skills and public visibility, she demonstrates that philosophy can drive real change.</span> </em></p>
