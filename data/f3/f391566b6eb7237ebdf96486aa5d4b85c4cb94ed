Christian Tietze has an informative post <a href="https://christiantietze.de/posts/2025/04/keep-org-mode-items-sorted-alphabetically/">that tells us how to keep an Org file sorted</a>. Your first question should be, &ldquo;What do you mean by sorted?&rdquo; Your second question should be, &ldquo;What does ‘keep sorted’ mean?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Tietze answers both these questions. The answer to the second question is easier. By &ldquo;keep sorted&rdquo; he means that after adding an entry to the file, it will automatically be inserted into its proper &ldquo;sorted&rdquo; place without the user having to do anything special.
</p>
<p>
The answer to the first question is &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;. Not very helpful, I know. The precise answer is &ldquo;whatever sorting order you can describe with <code>org-sort-entries</code>.&rdquo; Take a look at its documentation to see how many possibilities that entails. You can also provide your own comparison and data extraction functions so the practical answer is &ldquo;just about any order you desire.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
There is, of course, a bit of configuration that you have to do to have all this take place. Tietze&rsquo;s post explains how to set things up. The <code>org-sort-entries</code> function is so flexible that it will cover most cases out of the box but there is, as I said, an escape hatch for special needs.
</p>
<p>
This is another example of how much flexibility is built into Emacs and Org. Most users probably don&rsquo;t need and aren&rsquo;t even aware of the functionality that Tietze writes about but it&rsquo;s there for those who do need it.

<p>
As I and others keep telling you, it&rsquo;s not an editor, it&rsquo;s a Lisp instance with built in editing commands. You can make just about anything you need happen, usually pretty easily.</p>
