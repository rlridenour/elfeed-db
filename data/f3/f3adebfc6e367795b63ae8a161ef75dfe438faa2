<a href="https://theholdernessfamily.com/adhd-is-awesome/">ADHD is Awesome</a> (2024) by Penn and Kim Holderness
is a practical, positive, easy-to-read book on
living with ADHD.
</p>

<p>
I find ADHD-oriented tips useful. My brain is
prone to misplacing things, going off on tangents,
and having attentional hiccups. Organizing my life
around following my interests and minimizing
commitments helps me increase happiness and reduce
stress. Sketchnotes help me focus on what I'm
learning and provide visual stimulation in my
notes, making them more fun for me to review and
share. I don't stock extras of things in a
cabinet, but I do keep an Oops fund so I don't
have to beat myself up over mistakes that cost a
little money. I don't wear cargo pants, but I do
wear vests with lots of pockets, a habit I picked
up from my dad. I'm still working on developing
that 15-minute reset habit, and on seeing and
doing something about clutter.
</p>

<p>
As for the kiddo, there's no getting A+ to do
things she's not interested in, and there's no
holding her back if she's focused on something.
Tips for parenting kids with ADHD also seem to
work well for her: breaks, timers, taking
advantage of hyperfocus, avoiding shame. My job is
to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Practise connecting instead of correcting:</b>
Fretting at her doesn't accomplish anything.
We work better when we feel connected.</li>
<li><b>Explore and model things that work for me:</b> I
can show her how I use sketchnotes, checklists,
timers, breaks, curiosity, learning,
experimentation, self-compassion&#x2026; Also, taking
care of my sleep/exercise/happiness makes it
easier to be the kind of parent I want to be.</li>
<li><b>Help her learn how to figure things out for
herself:</b> I can help her navigate systems that
aren't designed for her (like school) and figure
out things that would work better for her.</li>
<li><b>Frame things positively:</b> Finding positive ways
to frame our quirks can help with both
self-image and other people's perceptions
(chapter 4). Focusing on our strengths works
better than beating ourselves up for our
weaknesses. We still want to work around our
weaknesses so they don't limit us, but might be
able to use our strengths to do that.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://epsig.substack.com/p/the-hypercuriosity-theory-of-adhd">The Hypercuriosity Theory of ADHD</a> (and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-024-00400-8">paper</a>)
is also a good read that's somewhat related.
