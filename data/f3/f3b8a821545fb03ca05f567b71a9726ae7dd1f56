In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-16/apple-s-iphone-road-map-iphone-air-2-iphone-18-mac-pro-future-tesla-carplay-mi1q4l2o"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, Gurman said that Apple Fitness+ may be merged into a broader new Apple Health+ service launching next year. If so, he said that Apple Fitness+ would no longer be available as a standalone subscription service.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Health+ will also feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/24/apple-health-plus-rumored-to-launch-next-year/">AI-based health coach</a> that offers nutrition planning and medical suggestions, according to Gurman's previous reporting.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Fitness+ launched in 2020. The service offers a library of trainer-led workout and meditation videos in Apple's Fitness app, across the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. In the U.S., the service costs &#36;9.99 per month or &#36;79.99 per year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Fitness+ is also available as part of the Apple One Premier bundle, with U.S. pricing set at &#36;37.95 per month. Gurman said there is a possibility that Apple will start letting customers pick and choose the services they want in an Apple One bundle in the future, and this might result in Apple Fitness+ remaining available as a standalone service.<br/>
