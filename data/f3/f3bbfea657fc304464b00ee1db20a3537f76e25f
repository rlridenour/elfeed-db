<h3>Apple Announces New 14-Inch MacBook Pro With M5 Chip</h3><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-macbook-pro-with-m5-chip/">updated the base 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M5 chip</a>, while more powerful 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models remain available with M4 Pro and M4 Max chip options.<br/>

In addition to the faster M5 chip, the new base MacBook Pro can now be configured with up to 4TB of storage that is up to twice as fast as in the M4 model.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, the M5 MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/new-macbook-pro-lacks-charger-in-europe/">does not ship with a power adapter in Europe</a>, with Apple removing it from the box in response to upcoming EU regulations that will require power adapters to be optional, though it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/17/eu-didnt-stop-apple-including-charger/">could have elected to address the requirement in a more consumer-friendly way</a>.<br/>

The M5 chip has up to a 10-core CPU, with a next-generation GPU with Neural Accelerator in each core for significant improvements in AI performance, while Apple's custom N1 networking chip delivers Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support. Apple's custom C1X modem in cellular models supports up to 50% faster data performance.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Apple Updates Vision Pro With M5 Chip, Dual Knit Band, and 120Hz Support</h3><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/apple-announces-vision-pro-with-m5-chip/">updated the Vision Pro headset with its next-generation M5 chip</a> for faster performance, and a more comfortable Dual Knit Band.<br/>

With the M5 chip, the Vision Pro offers faster performance and longer battery life compared to the previous model with the M2 chip. It also renders more pixels, allowing for sharper images and crisper text, and the Vision Pro can now ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate to reduce motion blur and provide a smoother experience when using Mac Virtual Display.<br/>

<br/>

A single line near the end of the press release states "‌Apple TV‌+ is now simply ‌Apple TV‌, with a vibrant new identity," which has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/13/apple-tv-vibrant-icon/">started to appear in the latest betas</a> of iOS 26.1 and related updates in the form of a more colorful icon.<br/>
