<p>I&#8217;ve heard from a lot of people questioning why the iPhone Air exists. This is common from power users when Apple releases a niche product. In my mind, there are several good reasons why the iPhone Air exists.</p>



<p>1. There are a substantial number of people who want the lightest and smallest iPhone they can get their hands on. Those people are not as concerned with battery life and camera quality as they are with weight, and now there is an iPhone just for them. Just because it&#8217;s not for you (or me) doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t a market for it. While the iPhone Air doesn&#8217;t qualify as the smallest, it certainly qualifies as the lightest. Those people are not normally power users, but their money is as good as anybody else&#8217;s, and I&#8217;m sure Apple is happy to take it to give them what they want.</p>

<p>2. This phone gives Apple the ability to experiment with making the thinnest possible iPhone at scale. That&#8217;s an important skill to master because…</p>



<p>3. Apple absolutely wants to make a folding iPhone, and a lot of the technologies they use to make the iPhone Air that thin are going to transfer into that folding iPhone next year.</p>
