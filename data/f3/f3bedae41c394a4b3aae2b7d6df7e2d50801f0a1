<p>Indonesian search-and-rescue teams have located wreckage believed to be from a fisheries surveillance aircraft that lost contact during a flight in South Sulawesi province, with aerial spotting guiding ground teams to a forested, mountainous area. Officials said the operation has been complicated by steep terrain and poor visibility, including fog, as teams work to reach the site and account for everyone on board. Authorities also reported recovering one body from the crash area.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/YoWOn2TGs_whnHC4lDh4QVNp-LErKPes1cKEbDBSv-RGY8-8NRXmgrqVxZpQq6Ah2gubdorKJURohyF0CUzrVmnl42avZWCAT5M-ODRib4rVWZb5LP-HkuZJM14kkGAPiW2cP88mcCVGH6HE8d_0H_MYUCx71_0OG3xx5R-aZq780OZPi2oC5zsWhqBt_Grrow' alt='Responders work amid difficult terrain after an aircraft went missing in South Sulawesi.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Mission purpose: The aircraft had been chartered to conduct air surveillance on fisheries for Indonesia’s Marine Affairs and Fisheries Ministry, and the passengers were ministry staff.</li><li>Aircraft type: Reports identified the plane as an ATR 42 turboprop operated by Indonesia Air Transport.</li><li>Search clues: A helicopter crew spotted what appeared to be a small aircraft window on the slope of Mount Bulusaraung, helping narrow the search area.</li><li>People onboard: Different outlets reported either 10 or 11 people on board, reflecting early, evolving information from officials and responders.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Indonesian authorities/search teams: Responders said they located wreckage on a fog-covered mountain slope and continued recovery efforts despite difficult conditions.
