iFixit today took apart the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/">iPhone Air</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> Battery pack, an accessory designed to work exclusively with the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;, and discovered something interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Did We Find the iPhone Air's Battery? Inside the iPhone Air MagSafe Battery" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkr58Sa2GeY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The battery inside the accessory has an unusual shape, leading iFixit to conclude that it's possible that Apple is using the same battery for the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Battery.<br/>
<br/>
iFixit compared the battery in the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Battery pack to the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; battery that Apple showed off when introducing the new device, and it does appear to be a close match if not identical.<br/>
<br/>
The battery has a 12.26Wh capacity, and it is 2.72mm thick, which means it is thin enough to fit inside the 5.6mm &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Battery pack is only able to charge an &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; to 65 percent even though it appears Apple is using the same exact battery that's in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but that's due to energy transfer loss during wireless charging.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj; &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Battery is thicker than the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;, and iFixit speculates that the size was the minimum needed to make it a viable product. The battery inside is protected with plastic and it does not have the same titanium frame as the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ifixit/">iFixit</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/18/iphone-air-magsafe-battery-pack-teardown/">iPhone Air MagSafe Battery Pack Uses Same Battery as iPhone Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-air-magsafe-battery-pack-uses-same-battery-as-iphone-air.2466493/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
