<li>It covers your windshield</li>
<li>Snow covers it</li>
<li>You take it off, removing the snow</li>
<li>Also: covers for your mirrors (that you don’t have to use if you don’t want to)</li>
<li>Is it available in Georgia Red: No, and who cares, it’s just gonna get covered in snow anyway</li>
</ul><h1>Somewhat Easier</h1><p>Getting snowed in?</p>
<p>It’s all about preparation. Stock up on essential groceries and other items. Request to work from home or else call in if you can. Then gas up the snow blower. Get the shovel and the salt ready. Do a pass in the middle of the storm if the accumulation will be too much to handle in one go once it stops.</p>
<p>Otherwise, make some hot cocoa, maybe add a little bourbon if you feel so inclined, get some snacks, turn on your favorite comfort food movie or TV show, and ride that thing out.</p>
<p>But then there are those things that can be tricky even for the ultra-prepared.</p>
<p>For example, dealing with your car when you don’t have a garage.</p>
<p>As we said, you can clear snow mid-storm to make the job more manageable later, and same goes for the snow on your car. But if the snow stops at 2am, and you’re already asleep in your warm bed, you’re pretty much screwed. Because whatever ends up on your windshield is gonna freeze.</p>
<p>Then, when eventually work or cabin fever drives you from your home, you will find your automobile is essentially a popsicle covered in shaved ice. You can turn it on and let defrost do it’s thing, but unless you want to let your car idle for, like, six hours (which we do NOT recommend), you’re going to have to do some brushing and scraping. Which means getting out the door early (lame), or doing a stressful rush job before rushing stressfully to wherever you need to go (also lame, not to mention dangerous; frantic, frazzled driving is bad enough on the nicest day, and only gets more hazardous as conditions worsen).</p>
<p>That is, unless you have one of these.</p>
<p>Or, well, actually, this doesn’t solve the whole issue. It does, however, make removing snow from your windshield easier. Slap it on before the snow hits, and then, come removal time, take it off. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>That does leave the rest of your car, of course–your roof, your hood, your trunk, et cetera. Which you should clean. Please. For all of us on the road with us. Like, as a former driveway dweller, I get it; it’s hard to get <em>all</em> of it off, but I beg of you, make an effort so you don’t create a mini-blizzard in your wake on the highway.</p>
<p>But still, even if you can save the time it takes to clear the windshield (and your mirrors!), that’s a win in our book.</p>
<p>In conclusion: it’s also good for frost mornings.</p>
