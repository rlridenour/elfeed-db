<p>The award was in recognition of the many Connecticut students who have attended workshops of the <a href="https://www.oxfordconsortium.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford Consortium for Human Rights</a> (OCHR).</p>
<p>OCHR was founded 13 years ago by Cheyney, his graduate student Johanna Luttrell, and Hugo Slim, formerly policy director of the International Committee for the Red Cross.</p>
<p>The Consortium has conducted over 35 week long intensive workshops at Oxford for over a thousand students, drawn from non-elite universities that would otherwise not have the opportunity to study at Oxford. Recent topics have included human rights and climate change, human rights and artificial intelligence, and human rights and community organizing. Next year the OCHR plans to begin a yearly conference for political philosophers on human rights, war and peace.</p>
<p>Cheyney also received an honorary doctorate in humane letters from Quinnipiac University in Connecticut in 2022 for his work in human rights education.
