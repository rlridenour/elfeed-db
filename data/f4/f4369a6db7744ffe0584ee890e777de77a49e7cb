Álvaro Ramírez is back with the fifth episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xenodium">Bending Emacs</a>. This video is about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1op2hyu/bending_emacs_episode_5/">Ready Player Mode</a>, his version of a media player in Emacs.

A year ago, Ramírez mostly moved away from streaming his music and went back to buying and playing his own copies of the music he liked. Of course, he wanted to do this from Emacs so he wrote his own Emacs-based music player. As Ramírez says, this is less of an effort than you might suppose. He leveraged Dired to keep track of the files and <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a> or one of several other music players to do the actual playing.

You can get a comprehensive tour of Ready Player Mode <a href="https://xenodium.com/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode">here</a>. The main point, at least from my point of view, is that you can move one more task into Emacs. That said, I&rsquo;ve been lazy and still haven&rsquo;t arranged to play music from within Emacs. I&rsquo;m still using the Apple Music App for that. Partly that&rsquo;s because some time ago I moved all my music to the iCloud so that it would be available on all my devices but mostly it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been too lazy to move the playing interface into Emacs.

Regardless, if you&rsquo;re looking for a way to move media playing into Emacs, take a look at Ramírez&rsquo;s video. It seems like a nice solution.</p>
