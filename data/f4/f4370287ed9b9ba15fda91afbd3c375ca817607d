Bozhidar Batsov is back with a quick tip that many of you will probably find useful. It&rsquo;s an improvement to <code>keyboard-quit</code> or, as we all know and love it, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>g</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
One of Batsov&rsquo;s pet peeves is that <code>keyboard-quit</code> doesn&rsquo;t function as expected when the minibuffer is active. Happily that and a few other infelicities are easily fixed <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2025/06/01/let-s-make-keyboard-quit-smarter/">as he shows in his post</a>. The code that Batsov presents in his post is short. It&rsquo;s more comment than code yet it does fix the problems that were annoying Batsov.
</p>
<p>
Here, from the code comments, is what his improved code does:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">The DWIM behaviour of this command is as follows:

- When the region is active, disable it.
- When a minibuffer is open, but not focused, close the minibuffer.
- When the Completions buffer is selected, close it.
- In every other case use the regular `<span style="color: #008b8b;">keyboard-quit</span>'.<span style="color: #8b2252;">"</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
You don&rsquo;t have to edit Emacs source code. You simply include his function in your <code>init.el</code> and remap <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>g</kbd> to it. It&rsquo;s easy to try out his code and if you don&rsquo;t like it, simply drop back to the default behavior by undoing the key sequence remapping.</p>
