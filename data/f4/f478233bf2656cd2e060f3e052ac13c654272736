I enjoyed walking in the park this week, and we
started gardening too. Good counterbalance to the
chaos of whatever the US is doing. I also enjoyed
writing more about life.
</p>

<p>
I added sidenotes duplicated as footnotes to my
blog, inspired by <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/free-and-open-access-in-the-age-of-generative-ai/">citationneeded.news</a>. The
sidenotes should show up on my blog if you have
Javascript enabled and the window is reasonably
wide. I like the way sidenotes allow me to me add
a little more context than a plain hyperlink.
Unlike the tangents that I've been tucking into
<code>&lt;details&gt;</code> elements, I don't even have to wait
until the end of the paragraph.
</p>

<p>
I also added an <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/on-this-day/index.xml">On This Day RSS feed</a>, which I've
added to my feed reader. I've been using it more
than the <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/on-this-day/">web view</a> to bump into my old posts.
Thanks to <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2021/02/10/reservoirs#:~:text=Naturally%20there%E2%80%99s%20an%20On%20This%20Day%20web%20feed%20too%20so%20these%20posts%20appear%20in%20my%20newsreader%20each%20morning.%20Some%20personal%20serendipity%20to%20start%20the%20day">Memexes, mountain lakes, and the

inspiration.<sup><a id="fnr.on-this-day-inspiration" class="footref" href="https://sachachua.com/blog/feed/index.xml#fn.on-this-day-inspiration" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> Ooh, let
me go add sketches to the RSS feed&#x2026; Might add
them to the web view as well at some point.

<p>
W-, A+, and I regularly played Minecraft after
dinner. This week, I set up tunnels going to a
trial chamber in the overworld and to a blaze
spawner in the Nether. A+ wants to get more XP in
a safe way, so I think I'll work on setting up
some XP farms. There's a skeleton spawner not too
far from our base, so that's probably a good
start.

<li>I hadn't realized that there was an <a href="https://social.sachachua.com/tags/orgmeetup">#OrgMeetup</a>
[on Wednesday], didn't notice <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@yantar92">@yantar92</a>'s email
on my phone, and I totally missed both
announcing it in Emacs News getting the
BigBlueButton server up. I've now added it as a
recurring entry on my calendar and I've added
cronjobs for the next six months so that
BigBlueButton will probably scale up and down
automatically. I'm so glad Ihor had Jitsi as a
backup. Whoops! Embarrassing&#x2026; <a href="https://social.sachachua.com/@sacha/statuses/01JRDWM0ZJ0RHF1EBGM3YEQPV5">(toot)</a></li>

planted radishes (Scarlet Globe, Easter Egg II Blend) and poppies
(Flemish Antique Peony, Canada Mix, and Purple Peony).  <a href="https://social.sachachua.com/@sacha/statuses/01JR6HBZZ720992HHZ4XBB9YXE">(toot)</a></li>

“BB: I've just finished writing a book, The Final Touchpoint I'd like to
get that out there. There are better and worse ways to handle our aging,
our denial of it, our acceptance, and&#x2014;as Erik Erikson put it&#x2014;our
being generative, to produce as much as we can while we can. I'm 98 but
I'm still trying to be generative.”

<p>
He died two years after the interview and I don't think The Final
Touchpoint has been published, but it might be interesting to find
similar books.

More writing and drawing this week, which was
nice. I still haven't gotten around to figuring
out how to squeeze those front-end consulting
requests in, since they take a fair bit of context
and concentration. It's okay.
