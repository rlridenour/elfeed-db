<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Bask in my superiority!!!</p>
<p>I subscribe not to Spotify,<br />Nor Pandora,<br />Nor Tidal.<br />Nor other music streaming platforms … errr, uh</p>
<p>Well, except for Apple Music … BUT that’s only for sharing my music across my Apple devices.</p>
<p>Well, except for Amazon Music that I get with my Prime membership … BUT that’s only for stuff I bought on Amazon that still has licensing for that specific piece of music at that time. And I barely use it, so … yeah.</p>
<p>Other than the 2 exceptions I mentioned, bask in my superiority!</p>
<p>Why am I so superior? Part of it comes from me long ago trying the streaming services and finding myself constantly skipping stuff I did not care for – they don’t seem to acknowledge to the jazz/classical/international/misc crowd. The algorithms are less than some make them out to be.</p>
<p>Part of it comes from the lousy way artists are paid by the platforms.</p>
<p>Part of it comes from the poor audio quality of what they serve.</p>
<p>Part of it comes from their attempts to in-house the “podcast boom” that only acts to silo content everyone knows was publicly available before the platforms got involved. Note: I do not want the platforms to silo podcasts.</p>
<p>Part of it comes from not being part of the faux censorship debate around some douche allegedly named Joe Rogan. Spotify bought that product. That’s their thing. I get to continue to not buy Spotify&#8217;s product regardless of if Spotify has that douche’s alleged content on their roster. Same goes for the other streamers … </p>
<p>I will continue to use Apple Music as needed and Amazon music until it looses all licenses for my purchased music.</p>
<p>By then I hope to own physical copies of my truly important media, by hook or by crook.</p>
