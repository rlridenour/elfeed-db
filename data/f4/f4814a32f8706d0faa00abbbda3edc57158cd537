<p id="p2"><a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/eu-fines-apple-e500-million-for-digital-markets-act-violations/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Last month</a>, the European Commission (EC) fined Apple &euro;500 million for violating the Digital Markets Act. Today, the EC issued its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202522/DMA_100109_906.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">full 67-page ruling</a> on the matter, giving Apple until July 23 to pay the fine or face accruing interest on the penalty.</p>
<p id="p3">The ruling focuses on Apple&rsquo;s anti-steering rules, which were the focus of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-breach-of-trust-apple-held-in-contempt-over-app-store-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the contempt order</a> recently entered by a U.S. District Court Judge in California. According to the EC:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote4"><p>
  Apple has not substantiated any security concerns. Apple simply states that some limitations, such as linking out only to a website that the app developer owns or has responsibility for, are allegedly grounded in security reasons. However, Apple does not explain why the app developer&rsquo;s website is more secure than a third party website which the app developer has taken the conscious decision to link out to. It also does not explain why this limitation is objectively necessary and proportionate to protect the end user&rsquo;s security and therefore has not provided any adequate justifications in this regard.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p5">(EC ruling at p. 22). In other words, &ldquo;the App Store isn&rsquo;t more secure than the web just because you say it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="p6">Apple has until June 22 to bring the App Store into compliance with the EC&rsquo;s ruling or face additional periodic penalties (EC ruling at p. 67). <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/eu-fines-apple-e500-million-for-digital-markets-act-violations/" rel="noopener noreferrer">As we reported in April</a>, Apple has said that it intends to appeal the EC&rsquo;s ruling.</p>
