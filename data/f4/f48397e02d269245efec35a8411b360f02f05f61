There's also a new Notes app and support for Live Translation.<br/>

tvOS 26 supports karaoke using an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as a microphone, improvements for using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> speakers with a TV, new Aerial screen savers, and support for quicker logins to apps at setup thanks to Apple Account syncing.<br/>

visionOS 26 adds support for spatial widgets that can be placed anywhere in the space around you, along with refinements to make personas more lifelike and support for shared spatial experiences between two Vision Pro users.<br/>
