<p>The Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics officially began Friday with an opening ceremony spread across four venues in northern Italy. Milan’s San Siro stadium anchored the show, with live video linking sites as athletes paraded in multiple locations. Organizers also lit two Olympic cauldrons in a multi-site format meant to bridge city and mountains in a single shared moment. The ceremony leaned into Italian culture and pageantry, with performances that included Andrea Bocelli and Mariah Carey. Coverage highlighted small, memorable touches and striking visuals, while photo galleries captured the breadth of nations on hand as competition began. The celebration also came with a political edge. Protesters in Milan demonstrated against the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel supporting the U.S. delegation and advising on security, and U.S. Vice President JD Vance was booed inside the stadium.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/PWPTuuk2ZDTyMkxyjUQuLNCFGzPVX-JbVrnjcWr8YoCEOnF2AcxfSNRwJQSLWtcwgkZlnTT4ytPaPFPo8MIzRiOeCmy-x70vHbZaf6IBctd2_nyeK1hibPinJhIni-nn8Ajaa9OHOhBbraVpApHQ9n6Ge0gl3rJkax1z0FFLJxOgjRWRHSGO-NaAUsQ1LI1R4hPnflgKMJyKOc0gQJ5_fPXkIFsXFuuMoY-B6OkFi1bwIuLgVFQcBFIYEA' alt='Artists perform during the Olympic opening ceremony at the 2026 Winter Olympics.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Creative direction: Italian creative director Marco Balich, a veteran of multiple Olympic opening ceremonies, oversaw the production and returned to design a home-country spectacle.</li><li>Performers lineup: Pre-ceremony coverage previewed performers including Mariah Carey and Andrea Bocelli, along with additional guests such as an actress known for roles in “The White Lotus” and “The Paper”.</li><li>Geographic scale: Le Monde called Milan-Cortina the most geographically dispersed Games in Olympic history, reflecting how events and festivities span multiple host locations.</li><li>African participation: Thirteen athletes from eight African countries are competing at the Milan-Cortina Games, continuing a Winter Olympics presence that sources trace back to 1960.</li><li>Athlete spotlight: Early coverage also flagged Lindsey Vonn’s return as one of the storylines as the Games opened.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Student protesters in Milan: Demonstrators called for ICE agents involved in the U.S. delegation’s security presence to leave, protesting U.S. immigration enforcement policies.
