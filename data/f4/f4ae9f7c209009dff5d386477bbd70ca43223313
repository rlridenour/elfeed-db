<p>Lex.Games is an iOS app (and website) for playing eight daily word games.</p>

<p>I paid Gruber many thousands of dollars to run this ad for free games which themselves have no ads. Please keep reading. </p>

<p>The games:</p>

<p><em>Conlextions:</em> Inspired by NYT’s Connections<br/>
<em>Lexicogs:</em> Solve crossword-style clues by assembling letter “cogs”<br/>
<em>By a Vowel:</em> A word jumble game with missing vowels<br/>
<em>Six Appeal:</em> Wordle with six-letter words</p>

<p>There’s also a daily <em>Mini Crossword</em>; a <em>Full-Size Crossword</em>; and <em>Mind Control</em>, which is a whole lot like Mastermind and not actually a word game at all; don’t sue me.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you only counted seven games here, the eighth is iOS-only. It’s called Letter Opener, and it’s my favorite.</p>
