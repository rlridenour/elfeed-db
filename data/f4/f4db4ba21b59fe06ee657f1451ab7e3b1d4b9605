<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <strong>stripspace</strong> Emacs package provides <code>stripspace-local-mode</code> and <code>stripspace-global-mode</code>, which automatically removes trailing whitespace and blank lines at the end of the buffer when saving.</p>
<p>(<strong>Trailing whitespace</strong> refers to any spaces or tabs that appear at the end of a line, beyond the last non-whitespace character. These characters serve no purpose in the content of the file and can cause issues with version control, formatting, or code consistency. Removing trailing whitespace helps maintain clean, readable files.)</p>
<p>If this enhances your workflow, please show your support by <strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/17.0.2/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> starring stripspace.el on GitHub</strong> to help more Emacs users discover its benefits.</p>
<p>The <em>stripspace</em> Emacs package additionally provides the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restores the cursor column on the current line</strong>, including spaces before the cursor. <em>This ensures a consistent editing experience and prevents unintended cursor movement when saving a buffer after removing trailing whitespace.</em></li>
<li><strong>Normalizes indentation</strong> by converting leading tabs to spaces or leading spaces to tabs, without modifying tabs or spaces within the text. (<em>Disabled by default.</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Restricts trailing whitespace deletion to buffers that were initially clean</strong>. When enabled, trailing whitespace is removed only if the buffer was clean before saving. (<em>Disabled by default.</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>(By default, <code>stripspace-global-mode</code> enables stripspace in all modes except those listed in the <code>stripspace-global-mode-exclude-modes</code> variable. By default, the excluded modes are: <em>view-mode</em>, <em>special-mode</em>, <em>minibuffer-mode</em>, <em>comint-mode</em>, <em>term-mode</em>, <em>eshell-mode</em>, <em>diff-mode</em>, <em>org-agenda-mode</em>, <em>message-mode</em>, and <em>markdown-mode</em>. <strong>Markdown-mode is excluded by default because</strong> trailing spaces are often used intentionally for line breaks in Markdown.)</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Here are the features of <code>(stripspace-local-mode)</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before saving buffer: Automatically removes all trailing whitespace.</li>
<li>After saving buffer: Restores the cursor&#8217;s column position on the current line, including any spaces before the cursor. This ensures a consistent editing experience and prevents unintended cursor movement when saving a buffer and removing trailing whitespace. This behavior can be controller by the <code>stripspace-restore-column</code> variable (default: <code>t</code>).</li>
<li>Even if the buffer is narrowed, <em>stripspace</em> removes trailing whitespace from the entire buffer. This behavior, controlled by the <code>stripspace-ignore-restrictions</code> variable (default: <code>t</code>).</li>
<li>An optional feature <code>stripspace-only-if-initially-clean</code> (default: <code>nil</code>), which, when set to non-nil, instructs stripspace to only delete whitespace when the buffer is clean initially. The check for a clean buffer is optimized using a single regex search for trailing whitespace and another for blank lines.</li>
<li>The <code>stripspace-verbose</code> variable, when non-nil, shows in the minibuffer whether trailing whitespaces have been removed or, if not, provides the reason for their retention.</li>
<li>The functions for deleting whitespace are customizable, allowing the user to specify a custom function for removing trailing whitespace from the current buffer.</li>
<li>The <code>stripspace-clean-function</code> variable allows specifying a function for removing trailing whitespace from the current buffer. This function is called to eliminate any extraneous spaces or tabs at the end of lines. (For example, this can be set to a built-in function such as <code>delete-trailing-whitespace</code> (default) or <code>whitespace-cleanup</code>.)</li>
<li>A global mode, <code>stripspace-global-mode</code>, is available to enable the feature across all buffers. Users can exclude specific modes by adding them to the <code>stripspace-global-mode-exclude-modes</code> list. Additionally, special buffers are excluded by default because <code>stripspace-global-mode-exclude-special-buffers</code> is set to <code>t</code>. However, the author recommends using the local mode instead, which is preferred for enabling the mode selectively in specific major modes.</li>
<li>Normalize Indentation: Convert indentation tabs to spaces or spaces to tabs (Disabled by Default).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already done so, <a href="https://melpa.org/#/getting-started">add MELPA repository to your Emacs configuration</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the following code to your Emacs init file to install <code>stripspace</code> from MELPA:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(use-package stripspace
  :ensure t

  ;; Enable for prog-mode-hook, text-mode-hook, conf-mode-hook
  :hook ((prog-mode . stripspace-local-mode)
         (text-mode . stripspace-local-mode)
         (conf-mode . stripspace-local-mode))

  :custom
  ;; The `stripspace-only-if-initially-clean' option:
  ;; - nil to always delete trailing whitespace.
  ;; - Non-nil to only delete whitespace when the buffer is clean initially.
  ;; (The initial cleanliness check is performed when `stripspace-local-mode'
  ;; is enabled.)
  (stripspace-only-if-initially-clean nil)

  ;; Enabling `stripspace-restore-column' preserves the cursor's column position
  ;; even after stripping spaces. This is useful in scenarios where you add
  ;; extra spaces and then save the file. Although the spaces are removed in the
  ;; saved file, the cursor remains in the same position, ensuring a consistent
  ;; editing experience without affecting cursor placement.
  (stripspace-restore-column t))</code></pre>
<p>(The <code>use-package</code> definition above uses <code>stripspace-local-mode</code>, which is preferred for enabling the mode selectively in specific major modes. Users who prefer to enable <em>stripspace</em> globally across all modes can instead enable <code>stripspace-global-mode</code>. Additionally, they can exclude certain major modes when <code>stripspace-global-mode</code> is enabled by adding those modes to <code>stripspace-global-mode-exclude-modes</code>. Special buffers are excluded by default because <code>stripspace-global-mode-exclude-special-buffers</code> is set to <code>t</code>.)</p>
<h2>Frequently asked question</h2>
<h3>How to prevent stripspace from deleting trailing lines?</h3>
<p>By default, the <code>stripspace-clean-function</code> variable is set to the built-in <code>delete-trailing-whitespace</code>, causing <em>stripspace</em> to remove both trailing whitespace and trailing blank lines. Trailing blank lines are empty lines at the end of a file that contain no content and appear after the last non-empty line in the buffer.</p>
<p>To prevent <em>stripspace</em> (and the <code>delete-trailing-whitespace</code> function) from removing trailing blank lines, set the <code>delete-trailing-lines</code> variable to <code>nil</code>.</p>
<h3>What is the purpose of checking if the buffer&#8217;s trailing whitespace is clean? (Disabled by Default)</h3>
<p>Checking if the buffer&#8217;s trailing whitespace clean helps prevent unintended modifications to files, preserving intentional whitespace and avoiding unnecessary edits.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you are submitting a merge request or pull request to a repository where some files contain trailing whitespace. If you modify just one or two lines in such a file, automatically removing all trailing spaces will cause the version control diff to display unnecessary whitespace changes throughout the file. This can make it harder for the reviewer to identify the relevant modifications, complicating the review and merge process.</p>
<h3>Normalize Indentation: Convert Tabs to Spaces or Spaces to Tabs (Disabled by Default)</h3>
<p>The <code>stripspace-normalize-indentation</code> option adjusts the buffer&#8217;s indentation to match the setting of the <code>indent-tabs-mode</code> variable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tabs to spaces:</strong> If <code>indent-tabs-mode</code> is <code>nil</code>, all indentation tabs in the buffer are converted to spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Spaces to tabs:</strong> If <code>indent-tabs-mode</code> is <code>t</code>, contiguous spaces used for indentation are converted to tabs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature can be enabled by setting the <code>stripspace-convert-tabs-and-spaces</code> option to <code>t</code>. <em>(The conversion behavior can be further customized using <code>stripspace-convert-tabs-and-spaces-function</code>, which defaults to the built-in stripspace function.)</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-elisp">;; The `stripspace-normalize-indentation' option adjusts the buffer's
;; indentation to match the setting of the `indent-tabs-mode' variable:
;; - Tabs to spaces: If `indent-tabs-mode' is nil, all indentation tabs in
;;   the buffer are converted to spaces.
;; - Spaces to tabs: If `indent-tabs-mode' is t, contiguous spaces used
;;   for indentation are converted to tabs.
(setq stripspace-normalize-indentation nil)  ; Set to t to enable</code></pre>
<h3>How to mark a buffer&#8217;s trailing whitespace as clean if it is unclean?</h3>
<p>When the <code>stripspace-only-if-initially-clean</code> variable is non-nil, <em>stripspace</em> deletes trailing whitespace only if the buffer is initially clean.</p>
<p>If the buffer is not clean, it remains marked as such, preventing trailing whitespace from being removed before saving.</p>
<p>To manually mark a buffer as clean, call the <code>(stripspace-clean)</code> function, which forces the deletion of trailing whitespace and updates the buffer&#8217;s state.</p>
<h3>Why delete trailing whitespace? Can&#8217;t tools like Git or diff ignore it?</h3>
<p>Tools like Git or diff can be configured to ignore trailing whitespace.</p>
<p>However, consistently removing trailing whitespace is still useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>It <strong>prevents conflicts caused by unnecessary end-of-line spaces</strong>, ensuring that merges and collaborative work remain smooth and predictable.</li>
<li>It <strong>eliminates noise in version control systems</strong>, allowing code reviews and diffs to focus solely on meaningful changes, which saves time and reduces cognitive load.</li>
<li>It <strong>enforces intentionality in the code</strong>, so every line and character serves a purpose, making the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and debug over time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It <strong>improves collaboration</strong>, as unintentional whitespace does not disrupt formatting or create frustration for other contributors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consistently removing trailing whitespace is not just a stylistic preference, it is a practice that directly improves readability, maintainability, and productivity.</p>
<h3>How to remove markdown-mode from the excluded modes in stripspace-global-mode?</h3>
<p>By default, <code>stripspace-global-mode</code> <strong>excludes <code>markdown-mode</code> by default because</strong> trailing spaces are often used intentionally for line breaks.</p>
<p>To allow <code>stripspace-global-mode</code> to remove trailing whitespace in <code>markdown-mode</code> as well, remove it from the list of excluded modes using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">;; Remove 'markdown-mode' from the list of modes excluded by `stripspace-global-mode'
(setq stripspace-global-mode-exclude-modes
      (delq 'markdown-mode
            stripspace-global-mode-exclude-modes))</code></pre>
<p>This ensures that all other excluded modes remain unaffected while allowing <code>stripspace-global-mode</code> to process Markdown buffers.</p>
<h3>What are the differences between stripspace and ws-butler?</h3>
<p>The <em>ws-butler</em> tracks modified lines and removes trailing whitespace only from those lines. However, it is slightly more complex, as it employs custom functions to track buffer changes, triggered by the following hooks: <code>after-change-functions</code>, <code>before-save-hook</code>, <code>after-save-hook</code>, <code>before-revert-hook</code>, <code>after-revert-hook</code>, and <code>edit-server-done-hook</code>.</p>
<p>In contrast, the <em>stripspace</em> package is lightweight. It operates solely on the <code>before-save-hook</code> to remove whitespace from the entire buffer using built-in Emacs functions, and on the <code>after-save-hook</code> to restore the cursor.</p>
<p>Optionally, when <code>stripspace-local-mode</code> is enabled, it can check if the buffer is already clean (with no whitespace) to determine whether trailing whitespace should be deleted automatically.</p>
<h3>What are the differences between stripspace and whitespace-cleanup-mode?</h3>
<p>The <em>stripspace</em> and <em>whitespace-cleanup-mode</em> packages are quite similar. The <em>stripspace</em> author wasn&#8217;t aware of <em>whitespace-cleanup-mode</em> when he developed <em>stripspace</em>.</p>
<p>Here are the key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customizations: <em>whitespace-cleanup-mode</em> uses the built-in <code>whitespace-cleanup</code> function (not all users prefer <code>whitespace-cleanup</code> because it deletes more than just trailing whitespace). There is no way to change this function in <em>whitespace-cleanup-mode</em>. On the other hand, the <em>stripspace</em> package defaults to the built-in <code>delete-trailing-whitespace</code> function, but users can assign a different function by setting <code>stripspace-clean-function</code>. For example, setting <code>stripspace-clean-function</code> to <code>whitespace-cleanup</code> makes <em>stripspace</em> behave like the <em>whitespace-cleanup-mode</em> package.</li>
<li>Performance: When <code>stripspace-clean-function</code> is set to <code>delete-trailing-whitespace</code> (default), <em>stripspace</em> function that detects whether the buffer is clean is faster than <code>whitespace-cleanup-mode</code>. (<em>stripspace</em> performs a single regex search for trailing whitespace and another for blank lines, while <code>whitespace-cleanup-mode</code> applies whitespace removal to the entire buffer. The performance of <em>whitespace-cleanup-mode</em> decreases as the buffer size increases.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the differences between stripspace and trimspace?</h3>
<p>The trimspace package only removes trailing whitespace before saving a file.</p>
<p>The stripspace package, however, provides additional features: it can restore the cursor column, optionally check if the buffer is clean before trimming, and customization of the whitespace removal function, etc. See the <a href="https://github.com/jamescherti/stripspace.el?tab=readme-ov-file#features">features</a> section of the README.md for details.</p>
