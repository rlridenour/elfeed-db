<p>Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the opposition Japan Innovation Party (Ishin) agreed to form a coalition, positioning LDP leader Sanae Takaichi to win a parliamentary vote on Tuesday and become the country’s first female prime minister [reuters.com#2][reuters.com#3][france24.com#1][aljazeera.com#1][theguardian.com#1]. The deal follows Komeito’s decision to end its 26-year alliance with the LDP after Takaichi’s selection as party chief; although the new alignment is short of a lower house majority, the vote for prime minister requires only a majority of ballots cast in any runoff, which Takaichi is expected to secure [reuters.com#3].
