As the version number implies, iOS 18.4.1 will obviously be a minor update that addresses software bugs and/or security vulnerabilities.<br/>
<br/>
There are no developer or public betas for minor updates like iOS 18.4.1.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.4.1 will be a stop-gap update ahead of iOS 18.5, which remains in beta testing. iOS 18.5 will likely be released to the general public in May, and so far the update includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-5-beta-features/">only two minor changes</a> in the Mail and Settings apps.<br/>
<br/>
The first iOS 19 beta should be released following the WWDC 2025 keynote <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/">on June 9</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/ios-18-4-1-coming-soon/">iOS 18.4.1 Update Coming Soon for iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-1-update-coming-soon-for-iphones.2455004/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
