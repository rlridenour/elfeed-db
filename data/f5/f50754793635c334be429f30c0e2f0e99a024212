<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A reflection on adding &ldquo;gatherer of books&rdquo; to the list of &ldquo;about me&rdquo; items.

        <blockquote class="verse epigraph" data-id="20221009T120440">
For being human holds special grief<br />
Of privacy within the universe<br />
That yearns and waits to be retouched<br />
By someone who can take away<br />
The memory of death<br />

<p>For awhile my personal tag line has been:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

I’m a recovering interrupter with occasional relapses, lover of spreadsheets,
blogger, adept debugger, conjurer of analogies, writer of code, and probably
other things.

</blockquote>

<p>But recently I added “gatherer of books” to that list.  I also feel like
“hoarder of books” nor “book-dragon” reflected the correct relationship.<small class="side-container">

  <span class="side" role="note"> I loved the scene in Battlestar Galactica, where Admiral Adama gifts
President Roslin a book, explaining that one does not lend books but gifts them.
A beautiful sentiment, letting go of a cherished possession, knowing that it is
the memory of reading that is cherished, not the book itself.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>

</p>
<p>I have gathered many books in my life.  Once in <a href="https://fablesbooks.com/">helping launch a local
bookstore</a>, other times in selling books at <a href="https:://soapygnome.com">my wife’s brick and mortar store</a>.
And also in growing our personal collection.</p>
<p>I’ve accepted that I won’t read all that I gather; they are instead touchstones
of past moments of inspiration, ready to burst forth again.</p>
<p>I think to what a wise man once said to me and my wife about ideas:</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

I like to sit along the river of ideas and look at them as leaves floating by.
I let many pass me, but some I pluck from the water, look at, and maybe return
to the river, or maybe hold for a bit.  Some I keep even longer, seeking the
mysteries held within.

</blockquote>

<p>These unread books are memories of untrod pathways, in which a congregation of
sparking fireflies illumined a pathway towards the captivating.  My response, to
those sparks, is to gather a book or two as a reminder of that pathway, maybe I
might return anew and take that fork in the road.</p>
<p>Sometimes I’ll set about reading one immediately.  Other times, they sit.  And
maybe a day, month, year, or decade later, I might pull that book off of the
shelf, remember, and then set about following that path untrod.  Yet even the
act of sifting through those books, churns something within me.  Memories of
curiosity, potential, and abundance.</p>
<p>I think about a term I recently learned: <dfn>quieseed</dfn>, a seed that stays
dormant due to an intuition not to seed until it finds a fertile environment.<small class="side-container">

  <span class="side" role="note"> From <a href="https://longreads.com/2025/03/13/language-words-climate-crisis/">Quieseeds</a>, an excerpt from <a href="https://nupress.northwestern.edu/9780810148376/my-oceans/">My Oceans - Northwestern University Press</a>.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>

Books are seeds, the carrier of yesterday, through today, and into tomorrow.</p>
<p>These books are also reminders of what has come before: the horrors, the
emergence, and the beauty.  There is an ebb and flow; of differing frequency.
Voices who have raged and struggled; witnessing the mix of progress and
setback.  All offering gifts to those who will sit and listen for a spell.</p>
<p>In decades past I could read for hours on end.  But as my daily habits
introduced more interactions with digital devices, I noticed something:</p>
<p>When I stop reading for a few months then return, I’m not able to read for as
long.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> Most of the books I read are paper copies.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
 It takes a few days of restarting my habit to rebuild my reading
endurance.  I find, in those restarting days, that it becomes a braid of garlic
to stave off the vampires of attention.</p>
<p>There’s also a defiance in choosing to disconnect, to slide on the ring of
invisibility, and disappear for a moment.  Communing with voices who took care
to write and publish their ideas, wisdom, and learning; sharing their voice so I
might hear more, expand my empathy, and see beyond the pathways put forward by
those vampires.</p>
<p>Which is also why I try to read broadly and diversify the authors (and genre):
to better prepare in me the conditions for change: to help me shed old skin,
molt yesteryear’s feathers, and shoot forth new growth.</p>
