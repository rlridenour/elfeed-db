<p>David pursued a career applying questions of ethics and philosophy to issues ranging from genetic testing to disability rights to criminal appeals. He worked over two decades at the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland, College Park (the Institute is now based at George Mason University). In 2007, he co-founded the Center for Ethics at Yeshiva University, led by his longtime collaborator, Adrienne Asch, before serving on the faculty of the National Institutes of Health Center for Bioethics, where he pursued bioethics research, organized academic events, and mentored numerous post-baccalaureate and post-doctoral fellows.</p>

He was a founding figure in the philosophy of disability and contributed extensively to debates on the ethics of reproduction. In 2015, he defended the ethical propriety of reproduction itself against David Benatar’s ‘anti-natalism’ in their book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debating-Procreation-Wrong-Reproduce-Ethics/dp/0199333556?crid=2D4WYNOV0ZQHV&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.acOp34qqIM15mELx4Xp1Xw.C0V5j7Q_2cYyY3hJ_UujgTIct78MnmRpglCC1P2iPOE&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=Debating+Procreation&amp;qid=1770243779&amp;sprefix=debating+procreation%2Caps%2C143&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=dainou-20&amp;linkId=ac251d0de5d88f77c8b63451364e0b19&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Debating Procreation</em></a>.
