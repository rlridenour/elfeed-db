<p>Ukraine has delivered a revised response to a US‑requested, 20‑point peace blueprint for ending Russia&#x27;s invasion, aiming to bring the plan closer to Kyiv&#x27;s own vision while keeping allied support intact. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is &quot;finalizing work&quot; on updated proposals and expects to continue detailed discussions with US negotiators and leaders of the so‑called &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; in the coming days. The new Ukrainian document follows criticism from Kyiv and several European governments that an earlier American draft, which included Ukraine ceding territory not currently occupied by Russia, gave too much ground to Moscow&#x27;s demands. The peace push has exposed tensions between Washington and European capitals, as President Trump publicly faulted European allies and signaled that US participation in future talks may depend on whether he views the negotiations as productive. Despite the strains, Kyiv and its partners frame the latest round of diplomacy as a chance to refine options for a negotiated end to the war while trying to safeguard Ukraine&#x27;s security and sovereignty.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/Di-tFgW8cfpGkGdH6Ijyn-RQKc0CJhKOn1ini0oDzOWUOkDsxJjHtV6YgsR07LNgicFKhn3IL7BEQMeYUwxu_fefhv4aj7SwuwjMrOlzitXhrOLeXnzb_vpHX7FjgAdyUN_aGLvWxxZFqfwZs2o4CJbQA6jXnNqYyNX-mcTEIGlqT6xRA_2nci-OOoJS8HoyFJ3n09dQeVLAcm8fNd9kojiC' alt='Representational image illustrating diplomatic efforts over Ukraine&#x27;s proposed 20‑point peace plan.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Coalition meeting: Leaders of Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; partners plan a video conference to review the updated proposals, coordinate positions and assess next steps in the diplomatic track.</li><li>Ukrainian assessment: A Ukrainian official briefed on the latest text said it &quot;takes into account Ukraine&#x27;s vision&quot; and is intended as &quot;a further proposal for adequate solutions to problematic issues&quot; raised by the initial US draft.</li><li>Contentious land clauses: Kyiv and several European capitals objected in particular to earlier US ideas that Ukraine relinquish areas not under Russian control, viewing such terms as rewarding maximalist demands from Moscow.</li><li>Trump&#x27;s public criticism: President Trump has sharply criticized both Kyiv and European governments over aspects of the emerging plan and has warned that the US could step back from discussions he considers a &quot;waste of time&quot;.</li><li>Upcoming Zelenskyy talks: Zelenskyy is preparing for urgent talks with allied leaders and officials, including US negotiators, as Ukraine seeks security guarantees and a peace framework that its domestic public and military can accept.</li></ul><blockquote>It takes into account Ukraine&#x27;s vision -- it is a further proposal for adequate solutions to problematic issues - Unnamed Ukrainian official briefed on the plan</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Government of Ukraine: Ukrainian officials describe the revised document as incorporating Kyiv’s own vision and offering new ways to address contentious points in the original US plan.
