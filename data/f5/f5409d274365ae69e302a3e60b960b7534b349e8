<p>It’s easy, as someone who writes about this stuff, to project our own preferences onto new products. And I’ll admit, I feel that pull strongly with the rumored iPhone Air.</p>



<p>As rumors continue to circulate about iPhone Air, a much thinner version of the iPhone that comes in at a higher price point than the entry-level model but not as powerful as the iPhone Pro, I can’t help but wonder: how big is the market for an expensive, skinny iPhone?</p>



<p>We’re now seeing mock-ups floating around, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84fbgEhayoQ">this one on YouTube</a>, as case manufacturers gear up. And yes, it’s definitely a lot thinner than the standard iPhone. But once you slap a case on it or even stick on an extra battery, you may very well end up holding something not noticeably different in hand from an iPhone Pro. Except now, it’s close to the Pro’s price&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;the Pro’s camera.</p>



<p>Maybe that’s the real inflection point: do you want a phone that’s slightly lighter, or one with a better camera? I suppose there’s a category of users who don’t take that many photos, or maybe never shoot video, and would gladly trade camera horsepower for something thinner and lighter.</p>



<p>The question (to which Apple should get an answer later this year) is exactly how many of those people are out there?</p>
