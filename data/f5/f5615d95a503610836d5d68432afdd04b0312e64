Apple has opened a temporary store in the mall, just down the hall from its original location, which will presumably be renovated. The company has not indicated when the original store will reopen, but its renovations often take months.<br/>
<br/>
Opened in 2001, Apple South Coast Plaza was one of the company's first retail locations, in the heart of Orange County. The mall is the largest in California.<br/>
