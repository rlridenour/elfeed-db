<p>Earlier this month, a group of authors sued Anthropic, the firm behind the Claude family of large language models, for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>The lawsuit states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Anthropic has built a multibillion-dollar business by stealing hundreds of thousands </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">of copyrighted books. Rather than obtaining permission and paying a fair price for the creations it </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">exploits,</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Anthropic</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">pirated</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">them.</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Authors</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">spend</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">years</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">conceiving,</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">writing,</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">and</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">pursuing </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">publication</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">of</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">their</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">copyrighted</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">material.</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">The</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">United</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">States</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Constitution</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">recognizes</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">the </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">fundamental principle that creators deserve compensation for their work. Yet Anthropic ignored </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">copyright protections. An essential component of Anthropic’s business model—and its flagship </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">“Claude” family of large language models (or “LLMs”)—is the largescale theft of copyrighted </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">works&#8230;</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Anthropic has not even attempted to compensate Plaintiffs for the use of their </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">material. In fact, Anthropic has taken multiple steps to hide the full extent of its copyright theft. </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Copyright law prohibits what Anthropic has done here: downloading and copying hundreds of </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">thousands of copyrighted books taken from pirated and illegal websites.</span></em></p>
<p>The group of authors includes writers of fiction and non-fiction. They want the court to require Anthropic to pay damages and to prevent the company from using pirated material in the future.</p>
