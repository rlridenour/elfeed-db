Many of us run Emacs on multiple platforms. Some, like me, simply run several OSs on our various computers, and some have one system type at work and another at home. Regardless, we all want a one true Emacs configuration that adapts itself to whatever system it&rsquo;s running on. Using a single configuration file means that you can make additions or changes and have them reflected across all your systems. Trying to keep such changes synced across several configuration files will, believe me, end in tears

Over at <a href="https://olddeuteronomy.github.io">The Emacs Cat</a>, olddeuteronomy, who deals with three different operating systems, explains <a href="https://olddeuteronomy.github.io/post/multiplatform-emacs-config/">how he handles a single Emacs configuration for all his systems</a>. The key to all such systems is using the Emacs variable <code>system-type</code>  to discover what OS you&rsquo;re currently running on and then conditionally executing system specific settings. Since most settings don&rsquo;t depend on the system type, this makes it easy to adjust general configuration items and have them take effect across all the systems at the same time.

Rather than clutter up my <code>init.el</code> with a bunch of conditionals, I use the following code at the start of my <code>init.el</code>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp"><span style="color: #b22222;">;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;</span>
<span style="color: #b22222;">;; </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Pull in system and platform specific configurations                    ;;</span>
<span style="color: #b22222;">;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;</span>

<span style="color: #b22222;">;; </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Just keep on going if the requisite file isn't there.</span>
<span style="color: #b22222;">;; </span><span style="color: #b22222;">Manipulations in second load is for "gnu/linux" &#8594; "linux"</span>

(load (car (split-string (system-name) <span style="color: #8b2252;">"\\."</span>)) t)
(load (car (reverse (split-string (symbol-name system-type) <span style="color: #8b2252;">"/"</span>))) t)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The first statement loads a file with the same name as the computer&rsquo;s name. The second loads a file with the name of the OS type. That way I can have a file, named <code>darwin.el</code>, with all the macOS specific settings and another for Linux specific settings. Similarly, if I need some machine specific settings—such as screen size—I simply put them in a file with the machine&rsquo;s name and the settings get applied automatically. I don&rsquo;t remember where I got the idea for that strategy but I&rsquo;ve been using it for a long time and it works well for me.
</p>
<p>
Whatever method you use, if you&rsquo;re dealing with more than one machine you probably need to adjust your <code>init.el</code> to handle them all seamlessly.</p>
