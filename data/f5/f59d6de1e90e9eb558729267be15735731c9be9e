In a <a href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/luXVWtplQ9Bokb">blog post</a> today, the well-known Apple supply chain analyst said that the iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be equipped with 12GB of RAM. He previously only expected the iPhone 17 Pro Max to have 12GB of RAM, so this is good news for customers who will be purchasing the other models.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said even the base-model iPhone 17 might be equipped with 12GB of RAM, but only if supply chain shortages can be overcome. He said that Apple will make a final decision on the amount of RAM it will offer in this device by May.<br/>
<br/>
All of the models in the iPhone 16 lineup are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/all-iphone-16-models-have-8gb-ram/">equipped with 8GB of RAM</a>, so the jump to 12GB would be a significant increase. Increased RAM can contribute to improved performance for Apple Intelligence and multitasking.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the base-model iPhone 17 sticks with 8GB of RAM, Kuo said he expects all models in the iPhone 18 lineup to have 12GB of RAM.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said the increased RAM will primarily benefit Apple suppliers Micron and SK Hynix.<br/>

Apple should announce the iPhone 17 series in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-12gb-ram-rumor/">iPhone 17 Air Now Rumored to Feature 12GB of RAM Like the Pro Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-now-rumored-to-feature-12gb-of-ram-like-the-pro-models.2455885/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
