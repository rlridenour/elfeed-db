<p>Dithering is my and Ben Thompson’s twice-a-week podcast — 15 minutes per episode, not a minute less, not a minute more. It’s a $7/month or $70/year subscription, and included in the Stratechery Plus bundle (a bargain). This year our CMS (<a href="https://passport.online/">Passport</a> — check it out) gained a feature that lets us make some episodes free for everyone to listen to on the website. Today’s episode, regarding Alan Dye leaving Apple for Meta, seems like a good one to do that with. (And, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/16/dithering-being-real-points">once again</a>, this month’s album art serendipitously captures my mood.)</p>

<p>Give it a listen. <a href="https://dithering.fm/">Subscribe if you enjoy it</a>.</p>
