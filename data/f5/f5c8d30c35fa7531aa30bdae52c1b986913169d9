<h2>4.6.0 on 2024-10-27</h2>

<p>This is a small release that makes minor refinements to an already
stable base.</p>

<h3>Command to rotate between selected Modus themes</h3>

<p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-rotate</code> switches from one theme to the next
in the list defined in the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-to-rotate</code>. The
default value of the user option covers all the Modus themes, though
users may prefer to set it to a small subset thereof.</p>

<p>Rotation works in such a way that (i) if the theme-to-be-loaded is
already the current one, the next in line is loaded instead, and (ii)
the next candidate is always to the right of the currently loaded
theme.</p>

<p>The rotation is done from left to right. When at the end of the list,
“right” points to the beginning.</p>

<p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-rotate</code> complements the existing commands
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-toggle</code> (which reads the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-to-toggle</code>
to switch between two themes) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-select</code> to select one
among all the Modus themes using minibuffer completion.</p>

<h3>More accurate faces for Org agenda dates</h3>

<p>We now adopt a more semantically consistent approach to the use of
font weights and colour intensity when styling all the permutations of
scheduled date and deadline faces. Pressing tasks stand out more,
while those that do not require immediate attention are rendered in a
more subtle style.</p>

<p>Thanks to Adam Porter (aka GitHub alphapapa) for suggesting this
revision and discussing the technicalities with me. This was done in
issue 102: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/102">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/102</a>.</p>

<h3>A slightly revised <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red-cooler</code> palette entry</h3>

<p>The value of this named colour now has a lower contribution from the
blue channel of light, meaning that it looks less pink and more rosy
red. The change is small, though it contributes to a more harmonious
distribution of colour in certain major modes that have preprocessor
constructs (e.g. for the C language).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">red-cooler</code> is also used in some contexts in Org and Org agenda
buffers.</p>

<h3>Completion popups are monospaced if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-mixed-fonts</code> is non-nil</h3>

<p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modus-themes-mixed-fonts</code> ensures that
spacing-sensitive constructs are always rendered in a monospaced font
(technically, they inherit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fixed-pitch</code> face). This is especially
useful when enabling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">variable-pitch-mode</code> in, say, an Org buffer that
has tables and code blocks.</p>

<p>The popup produced by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">corfu</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">company</code> packages will also be
rendered in a monospaced font if the necessary conditions are met,
ensuring proper alignment of all the elements.</p>

<h3>Directory icon colours are in line with each theme’s palette</h3>

<p>The directory icon presented by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all-the-icons</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nerd-icons</code>
packages is now rendered in the style of a semantic palette mapping
from the active theme, instead of using a hardcoded faint cyan colour.
This is to ensure that styles are consistent and that users with
deuteranopia or tritanopia get the desired colours while using the
relevant Modus themes.</p>

<p>For those who define palette overrides to refashion the themes, the
mapping is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">accent-0</code>: it is used in places where one or more
colours are needed for variation, such as what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">orderless</code> does in the
minibuffer or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">magit</code> in its status buffer.</p>

<h3>Refined support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">embark</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forge</code> packages</h3>

<p>We now cover more of their faces, have updated the relevant symbols of
those faces, and have made stylistic tweaks in the interest of
theme-wide consistency (i.e. the kind of quality you only appreciate
over time).</p>

<h3>Support for the built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hexl-mode</code></h3>

<p>It was using some background colour values that were somewhat hard to
read. Those are replaced with appropriate foreground colours.</p>

<h3>Documentation on how to support some packages</h3>

<p>These are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">combobulate</code>. Thanks to Damien Cassou in issue 108: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/108">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/108</a>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">engrave-faces</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">howm</code>. Thanks to Jabir Ali Ouassou for the discussion in issue 117: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/117">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/117</a>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meow</code>. Thanks to ZharMeny in issue 116: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/116">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/116</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are not covered by the themes for a variety of reasons, but that
may change in the future.</p>

<h3>Updated a colour value about the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">solaire</code> package</h3>

<p>This is another package whose support we only document. The manual was
referring to a colour that has long been removed from the themes.</p>

<p>Thanks to Edgar Vincent for bringing this matter to my attention. This
was done on the GitLab mirror, issue 316:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/-/issues/316">https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/-/issues/316</a>.</p>

<h3>Removed some needless <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:set</code> values from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defcustom</code> forms</h3>

<p>We did this after reviewing the state of the code following a
discussion with shipmints and Adam Porter about the behaviour of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setopt</code> macro when setting user options from the Modus themes. There
should be no visible change for users, though the edit is still useful
for the maintainability of the code. This was done in issue 118:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/118">https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/issues/118</a>.</p>

<h3>Switched to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if-let*</code> and its variants everywhere</h3>

<p>Emacs 31 deprecates the forms of these macros that lack the asterisk.
We can comply right away since the functionality is the same.</p>
