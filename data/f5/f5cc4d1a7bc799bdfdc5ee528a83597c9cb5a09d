<p id="p2">Announced earlier this year at <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI&rsquo;s DevDay</a>, developers may now submit ChatGPT apps for review and publication. <a href="https://openai.com/index/developers-can-now-submit-apps-to-chatgpt/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI&rsquo;s blog post explains that</a>:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment.
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p4">Under the hood, OpenAI is using MCP, Model Context Protocol, which was pioneered by Anthropic late last year and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/donating-the-model-context-protocol-and-establishing-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation" rel="noopener noreferrer">donated to the Agentic AI Foundation</a> last week.</p>
<p id="p5">Apps are currently available in the web version of ChatGPT from the sidebar or tools menu and, once connected, can be accessed by @mentioning them. Early participants include Adobe, which <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/adobe-announces-image-and-pdf-integration-with-chatgpt/" rel="noopener noreferrer">preannounced its apps last week</a>, Apple Music, Spotify, Zillow, OpenTable, Figma, Canva, Expedia, Target, AllTrails, Instacart, and others.</p>
<p id="p6">I was hoping the Apple Music app would allow me to query my music library directly, but that&rsquo;s not possible. Instead, it allows ChatGPT to do things like search Apple Music&rsquo;s full catalog and generate playlists, which is useful but limited.</p>

<p id="p8">Currently, there&rsquo;s no way for developers to complete transactions inside ChatGPT. Instead, sales can be kicked to another app or the web, although OpenAI says it is exploring ways to offer transactions inside ChatGPT. Developers who want to submit an app must follow OpenAI&rsquo;s <a href="https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/app-developer-guidelines" rel="noopener noreferrer">app submission guidelines</a> (sound familiar?) and can learn more from a variety of <a href="https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk" rel="noopener noreferrer">resources that OpenAI has made available</a>.</p>

<p id="p10">I haven&rsquo;t spent a lot of time with the apps that are available, but despite the lack of access to your library, the Apple Music integration can be useful when combined with ChatGPT&rsquo;s world knowledge. I asked it to create a playlist of the songs that The Replacements played at a show I saw in 1985, and while I don&rsquo;t recall the exact setlist, ChatGPT matched what&rsquo;s on <a href="https://www.setlist.fm" rel="noopener noreferrer">Setlist.fm</a>, a user-maintained wiki of live shows. I could have made this playlist myself, but it was convenient to have ChatGPT do it instead, even if the Apple Music integration is limited to 25-song playlists, which meant that The Replacements&rsquo; setlist was split into two playlists.</p>
<p id="p11">We&rsquo;re still in the early days of MCP, and participation by companies will depend on whether they can make incremental sales to users via ChatGPT. Still, there&rsquo;s clearly potential for apps embedded in chatbots to take off.</p>
