<p>John Voorhees, writing at MacStories, regarding a new command-line transcription tool cleverly named <a href="https://github.com/finnvoor/yap">Yap</a> written by his son Finn last week during WWDC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the way, Finn filled me in on a new class in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech">Apple’s Speech
framework</a> called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/speechanalyzer">SpeechAnalyzer</a> and its
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/speechtranscriber">SpeechTranscriber</a> module. Both the class and module are
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/277">part of Apple’s OS betas</a> that were released to developers
last week at WWDC. My ears perked up immediately when he told me
that he’d tested SpeechAnalyzer and SpeechTranscriber and was
impressed with how fast and accurate they were. [...]</p>

<p>What stood out above all else was Yap’s speed. By harnessing
SpeechAnalyzer and SpeechTranscriber on-device, the command line
tool tore through the 7GB video file a full 2.2× faster than
MacWhisper’s Large V3 Turbo model, with no noticeable difference
in transcription quality.</p>

<p>At first blush, the difference between 0:45 and 1:41 may seem
insignificant, and it arguably is, but those are the results for
just one 34-minute video. Extrapolate that to running Yap against
the hours of Apple Developer videos released on YouTube with the
help of <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp"><code>yt-dlp</code></a>, and suddenly, you’re talking about a
significant amount of time. Like all automation, picking up a 2.2×
speed gain one video or audio clip at a time, multiple times each
week, adds up quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s Foundation Models sure seem to be the sleeper hit from WWDC this year. This bodes very well for all sorts of use cases where transcription would be helpful, like third-party podcast players.</p>
