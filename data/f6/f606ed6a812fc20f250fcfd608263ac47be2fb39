After the <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12957">official release of Journelly 1.0</a>, Álvaro Ramírez has not been sitting on his laurels. He has a long list of feature requests from his beta testers and new users and has already <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/journelly-1-1-released">released Journelly 1.1</a> that implements many of them. You can check his announcement for the full list but they&rsquo;re mostly quality of life enhancements. For example, there&rsquo;s now  a hashtag picker that comes up when you push the <code>#</code> button. He&rsquo;s also added support for 10 additional languages. There&rsquo;s more—take a look at his post for the details.

<p>
One interesting aspect of his announcement is that he writes about a <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/157-2025-05-19-journelly-is-org-for-those-who-dont-do-org">post</a> from <a href="https://ellanew.com/about">Ellane</a> telling of her experience with Journelly. She makes two very interesting points. The first is that if you sync your Journelly files to the iCloud, you can control click on the directory to keep it always downloaded. That means you always have access to it even if you are offline.
</p>
<p>
Her second point is more important. I, and many others commenting on Journelly, have stressed that one of its strengths is its integration with Org mode. Ellane says that even if you don&rsquo;t know what Org is, Journelly is an extraordinarily useful app and well worth having. I made the same point while commenting on someone else&rsquo;s post but haven&rsquo;t stressed it enough. My use of Journelly as a memo book would work just as well even if I weren&rsquo;t an Org/Emacs user. Of course, the fact that I <i>am</i> an Org user makes it even better.
</p>
<p>
Let me say again that I really like this app. I&rsquo;ve been using it all day, every day and its ease of use and flexibility have improved my note taking. The other day I was on a web page that I wanted to save to Journelly. I was about to capture the URL and paste it into Journelly when I noticed that Journelly was in the share menu. I just clicked on it and the entry was automatically stored into Journelly for me. What could be easier? And did I mention that I can read and edit the file in Emacs?

<b>Update</b> <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2025-05-20 Tue 19:35]</span></span>: Ramírez reminds me that when you use the share button to add a web page to Journelly, you can highlight text on the web page and that will be added to the Journelly entry along with the page&rsquo;s URL.</p>
