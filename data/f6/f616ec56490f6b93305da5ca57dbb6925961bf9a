<p><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a> celebrates its ability to <em>export</em> to a multitude of formats. However, lesser known is its ability to <em>import</em> content. One of the ways to import into Org is through a custom URL scheme. This scheme is referred to as <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Protocols.html">Org Protocol</a> (scheme name: <code>org‑protocol://</code>). The motivating idea for using a URL scheme was this: <em>any</em> app outside of Emacs could construct and make an <code>org‑protocol://</code> URL request without needing any security permissions.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the original implementation of Org Protocol presumed that <code>emacsclient</code> would do the work of making the actual URL request to Emacs. This thinking did not consider the notion that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">app sandboxing</a> would become widespread practice, preventing other programs from calling <code>emacsclient</code>. So it is with recent releases of macOS: its default policy is to only allow an app to access programs within its prescribed sandbox.</p>
<p>That said, I ❤️ Org Protocol, so much so that I provided support for it in a utility called <a href="http://yummymelon.com/captee">Captee</a> that lets you share links and text clippings from the macOS Share Menu. I wanted Org Protocol to work on macOS, but for years it was broken due to its dependence on <code>emacsclient</code>. The only workaround was to use the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/src/master/">Mitsuharu Yamamoto fork of Emacs</a> which implemented native support for <code>org-protocol://</code> URL requests. For a number of years, the Yamamoto fork was my daily driver. Unfortunately though, it seems to have succumbed to bit-rot as it has not kept track with recent releases of GNU Emacs (in particular 30.1). I made the switch over to GNU Emacs 30.1, but in doing so I had to give up Org Protocol support.</p>
<p>I missed Org Protocol, so I decided to do something about it. I wrote an app.</p>
<p><strong>Scrim</strong> is a macOS utility to act as a proxy to take an Org Protocol request from any app and relay that to Emacs. In effect, <strong>Scrim</strong> is a native macOS client for Emacs server.</p>
