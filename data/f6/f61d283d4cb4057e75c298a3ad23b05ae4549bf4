<p>That is an excerpt from a March 11th letter from <a href="https://www.fredonia.edu/about/offices/president" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Kolison, Jr.</a>, the president of the State University of New York at Fredonia, to philosophy professor <a href="https://www.fredonia.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-liberal-arts-sciences/philosophy/faculty/Stephen-Kershnar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen</a> <a href="https://archive.is/HzQhZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kershnar</a>.</p>
<p>Readers may recall that Dr. Kershnar, a <a href="https://www.fredonia.edu/news/stephen-kershnar-named-suny-distinguished-teaching-professor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SUNY Distinguished Teaching Professor</a>, was barred by Kolison in 2022 from teaching his courses after a right-wing social media trolling account posted selectively edited excerpts from an appearance of Kershnar&#8217;s on a philosophy podcast. Details about those events are <a href="https://dailynous.com/2022/02/03/kershnar-cycle-reactivated/">here</a>. A source informs me that Kershnar&#8217;s lawsuit against Kolison and the university is ongoing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fredonia.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-liberal-arts-sciences/philosophy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Philosophy at Fredonia</a> was <a href="https://dailynous.com/2018/11/19/philosophy-threatened-suny-fredonia/">first threatened in 2018</a>. After the philosophy department chairs at <em>all </em>of the SUNY Campuses <a href="https://dailynous.com/2018/12/12/philosophy-chairs-suny-campuses-come-defense-fredonia/">came to Fredonia Philosophy&#8217;s defense</a>, it <a href="https://dailynous.com/2019/02/06/fredonia-philosophy-saved-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was spared</a>. But in 2023 it was <a href="https://dailynous.com/2023/12/07/suny-fredonia-president-recommends-eliminating-philosophy/">targeted again</a>, and the proposal to end the philosophy major was <a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/03/26/suny-fredonia-administration-approves-proposal-to-cut-philosophy/">approved in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>The Philosophy Department and its programs are being abolished &#8220;as a result of a curtailment of function and reallocation of resources,&#8221; Kolison&#8217;s letter said. There were no further details about the decisions.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/03/21/fredonia-cuts-kershnar-kills-philosophy-program/">Fredonia Cuts Kershnar, Kills Philosophy Program</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
