<p>I think I mentioned this on the podcast at some point: One summer morning in 1815, proprietor William Butterfield opened the White Wells at Ilkley, West Yorkshire, to a sound of whirring:</p>
<blockquote><p>
All over the water and dipping into it was a lot of little creatures, all dressed in green from head to foot, none of them more than eighteen inches high, and making a chatter and jabber thoroughly unintelligible. They seemed to be taking a bath, only they bathed with all their clothes on.</p>
<p>Soon, however, one or two of them began to make off, bounding over the walls like squirrels. Finding they were all making ready for decamping, and wanting to have a word with them, he shouted at the top of his voice &#8212; indeed, he declared afterwards, he couldn&#8217;t find anything else to say or do &#8212; &#8216;Hallo there!&#8217; Then away the whole tribe went, helter skelter, toppling and tumbling, heads over heels, heels over heads, and all the while making a noise not unlike a disturbed nest of young partridges.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1252362?seq=1">account</a> recorded by Charles C. Smith in the <em>Folk-Lore Record</em> of 1878. Butterfield had died in 1844, but Smith had the story from his associate John Dobson, who described the bathman as &#8220;a good sort of a man, honest, truthful, and steady, and as respectable a fellow as you could find here and there.&#8221; The fairies made no comment.</p>
