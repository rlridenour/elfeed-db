The violence came as U.S.-brokered truce arrangements that had eased parts of the two-year war — and allowed more aid and returns to the enclave — appear fragile again.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/hpEE3R38dQQfb9R21w8VnVDOK2hiZcHEZD9vlFdKz1DRVKGHXHjLMxu4TS_Yh7ty-x22vgs3TxrCGjRyCuLJfQh2gUBWW-oQLjbgnd608UCl' alt='Palestinians walk among piles of rubble in the northern Gaza Strip on November 19. — Reuters' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Civilian sites hit: Medics said strikes struck a building linked to Muslim religious authorities in Zeitoun and a UN-run club in Khan Younis that housed displaced families, highlighting risks to shelter sites</li><li>Command targets: Israeli forces said their wave of strikes included attacks on senior Hamas figures — including a reported commander and a naval chief — after gunfire at IDF troops</li><li>Violence spills to Lebanon: Israel also launched strikes in southern Lebanon on sites it blamed on Hezbollah, and a separate strike hit the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp, which observers called the deadliest Lebanon attack since last year’s ceasefire</li><li>Ceasefire mechanics: The October truce — described in reporting as U.S.-brokered and part of a broader post-war plan — included informal geographic lines and phased steps toward a second phase, which officials now say the coordination centre is trying to advance</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli military: The military said it struck Hamas targets across Gaza after members of the Palestinian militant group fired on its troops, and reported no Israeli injuries.
