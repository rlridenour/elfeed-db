"As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this was, in so many ways, a remarkable quarter for Apple, and we're excited for all the opportunities we'll have in the year ahead to deliver innovations that have never been seen before and enrich the lives of users every step of the way," <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2026/01/this-is-tim-complete-transcript-of-apples-q1-2026-financial-call/">said Cook</a>, on an earnings call on Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
Cook hypes up Apple's future on every earnings call, but "innovations that have never been seen before" is particularly bold wording compared to his usual comment about how the company's product pipeline is stronger than ever.<br/>
<br/>
