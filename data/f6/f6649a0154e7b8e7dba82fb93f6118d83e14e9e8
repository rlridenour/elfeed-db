With a recent hugo upgrade on my machine, suddenly all my front-pages were links to my &ldquo;posts&rdquo; section and only one click later would you see what had correctly been my homepage previously. I received no help on Reddit or on the themes (which, some of which, unfortunately, are no longer maintained), so did some studying and got it back to working. Here is hoping this helps solve your issue.
