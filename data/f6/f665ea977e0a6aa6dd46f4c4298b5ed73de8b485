<p>I <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2025/04/perplexity-moves-into-mobile/">wrote yesterday</a> that maybe Apple needs to buy Perplexity. To make my case, Perplexity released a voice assistant to their iOS app that makes Siri look pretty bad. </p>



<p>I occasionally make quick videos for the MacSparky labs members that don&#8217;t go through the usual edit process, just to get a quick demo or sample out. This was one of those. But this time I&#8217;m sharing it with everyone. If you&#8217;d like more content like this, check out the <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/join/">MacSparky Labs</a>.</p>
