<p>I&rsquo;m finding it hard to enjoy video games recently. They all feel&hellip; the same. I keep playing World of Warships (that&rsquo;s more of an addiction) and Helldivers here and there, but I want something with a story, and even though there are a couple of options, I can&rsquo;t seem to be interested in anything in particular.</p>
