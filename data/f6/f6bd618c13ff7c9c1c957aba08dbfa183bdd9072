Beta testers that have registered on Apple's website can download the &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 26&zwnj; updates by opening the Settings app, going to the General section, tapping on Software Update, and choosing the &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPadOS 26&zwnj; Public Beta options.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 26&zwnj; feature Apple's Liquid Glass design, with a visual aesthetic that focuses on transparency. Icons, menu buttons, navigation bars, and more reflect and refract light with subtle animations. There are pop-out menus in some areas, tab bars shrink down, and everything has a more rounded look.<br/>
