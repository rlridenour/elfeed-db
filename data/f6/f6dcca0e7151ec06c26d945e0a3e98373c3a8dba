<p>You may recall from my “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/siri_is_super_dumb_and_getting_dumber#fn3-2025-01-23">Siri Is Super Dumb and Getting Dumber</a>” piece back in January that the Dickinson Public Schools District in North Dakota had the rather unfortunate nickname the “Midgets”. Back in March, <a href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/dickinson-high-to-retire-midgets-mascot-after-nearly-a-century">the school district announced they’d be retiring the nickname</a>, after nearly a century. Last month <a href="https://www.dickinson.k12.nd.us/our-district/news/1810076/a-new-era-students-choose-dickinson-mavericks">they announced their new name</a>: the Mavericks. I’m going to call this the best rebranding of the year.</p>

<p>We still have <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/education/2024/11/19/estherville-lincoln-central-school-district-says-no-to-name-change/76333861007/">the Estherville, Iowa Midgets</a> to cheer for. But even better: <a href="https://yumahs.yumaunion.org/about-us/our-history">the Yuma Criminals in Arizona</a>. Now that’s a nickname.</p>
