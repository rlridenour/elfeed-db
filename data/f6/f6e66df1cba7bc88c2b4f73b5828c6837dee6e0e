</ul><h1>Plant-Based Pups</h1><p>Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/veganpets/comments/mavs6s/tried_bright_planet_burger_treats_for_dogs_highly/">r/veganpets</a>, user daftstar sang the praises of these Bright Planet treats. According to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of plant-based sweet treats on the market, but not really many savory ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great point and one we didn’t consider the previous time we sold these.</p>
<p>In the comments from that last sale, our very own <a href="/@Pufferfishy">@Pufferfishy</a> talked about their dog Max’s veggie intake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Max eats anything but “leafy greens” - we’ve been “bulking up” his food with veggies since he was a pup (he was getting a bit plump, but simply reducing his food left him ravenous all the time - enter carrots and green beans).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end, they added: “And his treats are simple air-fryer dehydrated yams - he loves them.” Which is awesome, and probably a bit better than whatever amalgamation of bullshit you get in those little soft treats that look like tiny T-bone steaks.</p>
<p>But not every dog wants something sweet like yams. Sometimes, they want something meaty. If your dog is one of those dogs, you can give them these and they can enjoy a little bit of meaty flavor without even a little bit of actual meat.</p>
<p>Is this a good sales pitch?</p>
<p>Maybe!</p>
<p>But maybe not.</p>
<p>What we’ve really established here is:</p>
<ol>
<li>It certainly would be cool if we could get this deal posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/veganpets/">r/veganpets</a> because we have to imagine the people there would be pumped to get this stuff at just $2 bucks per bag.</li>
</ol>
<p>And…</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>To establish, as <a href="/@Pufferfishy">@Pufferfishy</a> demonstrated, dogs are not inherently afraid of meat-free food. In fact, many of them will eat literally anything. And our price is cheap enough that you can afford to give these a try even if your dog isn’t on a plant-based diet.</li>
</ol>
<p>So buy them.</p>
<p>And those who bought them last time, tell us how your doggos liked them.</p>
