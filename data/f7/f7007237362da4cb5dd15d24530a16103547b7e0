<p>British political commentator Sami Hamdi was detained by U.S. immigration authorities and placed in ICE custody while on a speaking tour in the United States; officials say his visa has been revoked and he will be deported rather than allowed to continue the tour . Civil liberties and Muslim advocacy groups say the detention appears to be retaliation for Hamdi’s public criticism of Israel, calling the action an attack on free expression, while a far-right activist allied with President Trump publicly celebrated the detention . The case has drawn attention to how immigration enforcement, political activism and online pressure can intersect in high-profile speaking events .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/AOkUtldh-VjUYGBahf88l_KETpx38OqLzM1ce97fX5kT9farRbTF_IilkubNsGkJ_hG1M4Hhn1auv-olGSNyPtSig66rha_csC4_S7oU7PxeOV0rS33zZC6zw36odTWEzOE9WL_j972SlMKGSd_DYPFQQX2ADWUtSeNMo-GpaahTN-SvaoTOgDUgNMCkrDnu9NU2jkpKoEsQfl3tj8va0ANkCS34TvxL70DHHQLQkH3xQC7Lkyv7fxpj1XhKyw5a0sOS-9IpHblUh5NSybO1wfI' alt='File photo of Sami Hamdi; news outlets report he was taken into ICE custody during a U.S. speaking tour' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Detention location: Reports say Hamdi was detained by federal immigration agents at San Francisco International Airport and moved into ICE custody</li><li>Alleged pressure: Al Jazeera reports the detention occurred amid pressure from pro-Israel lobby groups, according to sources and local coverage</li><li>Political actor: Far-right activist Laura Loomer — identified in news coverage as an ally of President Trump — publicly celebrated and claimed credit for prompting the action</li><li>Rights concerns: The Council on American-Islamic Relations called the move &#x27;a blatant affront to free speech,&#x27; framing the detention as retaliation for criticism of Israel</li></ul><blockquote>A blatant affront to free speech - Council on American-Islamic Relations</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR): CAIR said the detention was &#x27;a blatant affront to free speech&#x27; and described it as apparent retaliation for Hamdi&#x27;s criticism of Israel.
