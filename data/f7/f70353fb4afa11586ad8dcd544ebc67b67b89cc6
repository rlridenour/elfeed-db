<p>Apple’s annual tradition of commissioning a special holiday-themed commercial film continues this year with “A Critter Carol,” a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-avONMmQtlI">two-minute long film</a> starring an array of singing woodland creatures portrayed by hand-made puppets.</p>

<p>The film definitely gives off muppet vibes, what with the shaggy forest puppets, occasional good-natured mayhem, and humor amplified by the spot’s use of <a href="https://youtu.be/jeEpTTNdCFg?si=GuMLu3MPKYhLn7UA">a fun song, “Friends,” by Flight of the Conchords</a>. Muppet vibes are good.</p>
<p>In addition to being imbued by the spirit of the holidays, does the film spotlight a blue iPhone 17 Pro? Yes, Virginia, it does. And as you might expect, it was shot (by veteran Apple short director Mark Molloy) on iPhone. (There’s also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANqqg8BoNoU">brief behind-the-scenes video</a> that’s almost as cute as the film.)</p>
