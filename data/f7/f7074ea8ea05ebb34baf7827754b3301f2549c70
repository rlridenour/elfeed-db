<p>Another great video from Quinn Nelson. If your dumb cousin who knows you’re an Apple nerd approaches you on Christmas and says “<em>Hey what’s going on at Apple, Bloomberg says it’s rats leaving a sinking ship over there?</em>” and you don’t feel like explaining, just tell him to watch this video. Just the perfect explanation.</p>
