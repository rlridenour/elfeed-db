<p>A 22-year-old student from China who had traveled from China to Texas to study philosophy at the University of Houston was detained upon arrival in the state, questioned, and deported back to China 36 hours later, according to the Associated Press.<span id="more-54838"></span></p>
<p>The student, identified only by his family name, Gu, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/chinese-students-trump-deportations-visas-1820a05254632a3d0fa52ab85f47fe31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AP reports</a>, had his paperwork in order, and had a full scholarship to the MA program in <a href="https://uh.edu/class/philosophy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">philosophy at the University of Houston</a>.</p>
<p>He had previously spent a semester as an exchange student at Cornell University.</p>
<p>Gu also was banned from returning to the US for five years, &#8220;abruptly halting his dream for an academic career in the United States,&#8221; according to the AP. Gu said of the events, &#8220;There is no opportunity for the life I had expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>The AP reports:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Gu told AP that he liked his Cornell experience so much that he applied for a master’s program to study philosophy in the U.S.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Despite reports of stricter policies by the Trump administration, Gu said he wasn’t too worried, not even when he was first stopped and taken to a room for questioning by a customs officer after landing at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. His belongings were searched, and his electronics were taken away, he said.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>After the officer went through the devices, he started interrogating Gu, focusing on his ties to the Chinese Communist Party, Gu said.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>He said his parents are party members, but he has never joined, though he — like nearly all Chinese teens and young people — is a member of the party’s youth arm, the Communist Youth League.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The customs officer also grilled him on his connections to the governmental China Scholarship Council, which popped up in his chat history. Gu said it came up in his chats with his schoolmates, but he did not receive money from the Chinese government.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Three rounds of interrogation lasted 10 hours, before Gu was told he was to be deported. No specific reason was given, he said, and the removal paperwork he provided to AP indicated inadequate documentation.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>By then [following the flight and the interrogation], he had hardly slept for 40 hours. The waiting room where he was kept was lit around the clock, its room temperature set low.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“I was so nervous I was shaking, due to both being freezing cold and also the nerves,” Gu said. “So many things were going through my head now that I was being deported. What should I do in the future?”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>It would be another day before he was put on a flight. Now, Gu is considering appealing the decision, but that might take years and cost thousands of dollars.</em></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>A commenter has shared a link to the student&#8217;s own account of what happened. An excerpt:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>By this time, it was around 11 p.m. local time. I had been traveling for 29 hours and was utterly exhausted, but the anxiety kept me from sleeping. About an hour or two later, D [a US Customs and Border Protection agent] called me back to his office. This time, he was a completely different person, full of aggression. As soon as I entered, he slammed the door shut, glared at me, and demanded, &#8220;Why did you lie to me? Do you know that lying to a federal officer is a felony, and you could go to jail for it!&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As I stood there confused, he followed up with, &#8220;Why did you say you never joined the CSSA?&#8221; I was even more bewildered, as I had never paid attention to such a student organization before. He then picked up my phone, opened WeChat, and pointed at our university&#8217;s &#8220;CSSA Chinese Student Freshmen Group,&#8221; asking, &#8220;Then what is this?&#8221; It was only then that I realized this freshman group, which I had joined after receiving an email invitation, was one of his main points of suspicion. D continued, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that the CSSA is funded by the Chinese government and is responsible for stopping any speech in the U.S. that slanders the Chinese government?&#8221; Actually, my first reaction was to laugh, and I wanted to tell him that the head of our CSSA freshman group was an American (though I didn&#8217;t say it to protect her). Still, I naively thought this wouldn&#8217;t be a reason for him to deport me.</em></p>
