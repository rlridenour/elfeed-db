<p>The Advent of Code will begin in a couple of hours.  I've prepared a Common
  Lisp project to hold the code.  You can clone it from
  <a href="https://github.com/jrm-code-project/Advent2025.git">https://github.com/jrm-code-project/Advent2025.git</a>  It contains an
  <code>.asd</code> file for the system, a <code>package.lisp</code> file to define the
  package structure, 12 subdirectories for each day's challenge (only 12 problems in this year's calendar), and a
  file each for common macros and common functions.</p>

<p>As per the Advent of Code rules, I won't use AI tools to solve the
  puzzles or write the code.  However, since AI is now part of my
  normal workflow these days, I may use it for enhanced web search or
  for autocompletion.</p> 

<p>As per the Advent of Code rules, I won't include the puzzle text
  or the puzzle input data.  You will need to get those from the
  Advent of Code website (<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2025">https://adventofcode.com/2025</a>).</p>
