<p>UN Secretary-General António Guterres has warned all 193 member states that the United Nations is nearing a cash crunch that could disrupt core operations as soon as July 2026, driven by unpaid mandatory dues and broader funding shortfalls. He urged countries to pay what they owe or to reform UN financial rules to prevent what he described as an “imminent financial collapse”. Several outlets highlight the role of the United States—the UN’s largest contributor—in the current squeeze, noting that President Donald Trump’s administration reduced some voluntary funding to UN programs and withdrew from the World Health Organization, even as Washington has also made large humanitarian pledges. Despite the gravity, the situation also points to a practical opportunity: if member states agree on reforms and predictable payment schedules, the UN could stabilize its finances and keep essential diplomacy and humanitarian coordination running without interruption.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/McAbADjdqzwNMCZ7W4wXZ1MpFEnKicLqdIif7O0Akt1OWVanijtkmfwgcDeRyGEqetUb-wenH9JZLyd-VlvMP_7AK1xkR-zxYqUWFTxX2KiErzL2qHqg9yb5ndb1GExi5v6g6pgGoP1ol_IW6saV_TusOZPe81m-ujhIbS4xlYvFG0K4g-Zxu_Mr6Zl8HcGJJECtfA7Qjdcsvs40CP6cTx0pMX93zkCh56DYVK38WGDVcnG1mgZcJZ-Ic76ElobUcXYrKG-UyWs6-UVuKg' alt='UN Secretary-General António Guterres speaks on a screen during a press conference at UN headquarters in New York City, January 29, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Record arrears: Guterres said outstanding regular-budget dues hit a record $1.568 billion at the end of 2025, with collections covering only 76.7% of assessed contributions.</li><li>US balance: A UN official cited by The Hindu said the U.S. owes $2.196 billion to the UN regular budget and will owe an additional $767 million for 2026.</li><li>NY headquarters: The UN warned it could be forced to close its New York headquarters if annual dues are not paid, according to The New York Times.</li><li>Rules problem: Guterres described a “Kafkaesque cycle” in which UN rules can require returning unspent program funds to member states even when pledged contributions were never actually paid.</li><li>US policy line: RT reports President Trump said U.S. pullbacks aimed to “end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities,” and the U.S. formally withdrew from the WHO last week.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>UN Secretary-General António Guterres: Guterres warned member states the UN faces an “imminent financial collapse” without urgent action on unpaid dues and financial rules.
