I&rsquo;ve written a couple of times about Álvaro Ramírez&rsquo;s Journelly [<a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12842">1</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12848">2</a>] and how it seemed like a good fit for my memo book needs. In the last of those posts, Ramírez announced that he was starting an official beta program. I wrote that I might sign up but as usual inertia prevailed and I didn&rsquo;t get around to it.

<p>
In his <a href="https://lmno.lol/alvaro/the-mac-observer-showcases-journelly">latest post</a> on Journelly, Ramírez notes that Mac Observer has a <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/tips/round-ups/journelly-journal-app-ios/">review of Journelly</a>. I hopped over there to take a look and was impressed. It&rsquo;s a nice review and makes Journelly seem like an even better fit for my needs than I had previously thought. If you&rsquo;re the slightest bit interested in Journelly or think you might be, you should definitely take a look at the Mac Observer review.

Ramírez&rsquo;s posts on Journelly tend to emphasize it&rsquo;s use as a sort of private Twitter/X but the Mac Observer review makes clear that it can also be used as a kind of journaling app as well. One of the best parts, from my point of view, is that the data is saved in Org mode format so I should be able to integrate it into my Emacs workflow easily.

In any event, I was finally able to bestir myself to email Ramírez and ask for a beta invite. He responded right away with my invite and I installed it without a problem. I&rsquo;ve never participated in an iOS beta before and wasn&rsquo;t sure how to get the beta app installed. It turns out to be easy. Apple has a special app called <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/">TestFlight</a> that automates everything. You simply install TestFlight, click on the invite, and everything else happens automatically.

I just finished the install and haven&rsquo;t had time to play with Journelly yet but I&rsquo;ll let you know what I think as soon as I get a bit of experience with it.</p>
