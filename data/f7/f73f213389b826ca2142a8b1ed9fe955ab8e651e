or region after a given function is invoked. Several user options
control the exact behaviour. <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-03-14-emacs-pulsar-demo/">Watch the original demo</a>.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<p>This version refines an already stable base. Users do not need to make
any changes to their setup, unless they wish to try the new features.</p>

<h2>Automatically pulse the affected region</h2>

<p>With the out-of-the-box settings, Pulsar temporarily highlights the
current line after any of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-pulse-functions</code> is invoked and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-mode</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-global-mode</code>) is enabled.</p>

<p>The new user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-pulse-region-functions</code> makes Pulsar
temporarily highlight the affected region as well. For example, when
pasting some text into the buffer, it will highlight the portion of
text that was added.</p>

<p>The default value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-pulse-region-functions</code> is nil, meaning
that no region pulsing is in effect (what we had before). Otherwise,
it is a list of functions. A typical use-case is the following:</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">pulsar-pulse-region-functions</span> <span class="nv">pulsar-pulse-region-common-functions</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This covers common commands, such as for copying and pasting a region
of text (restart <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-mode</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-global-mode</code> if needed).</p>

<p>Thanks to shipmints and Abdelhak Bougouffa for contributing the core
of this functionality. It was done in pull request 25:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar/pull/25">https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar/pull/25</a>. Abdelhak’s
contribution is within the ~15 line limit, meaning that no copyright
assignment to the Free Software Foundation is necessary, while
shipmints has already done the paperwork.</p>

<p>Relevant discussions took place in issues 10, 18, 21, and 22, as well
as pull request 24:</p>

</ul>

<p>Thanks to Anwesh Gangula, Alex Kreisher, Diego Alvarez, and Ronny
Randen for their participation.</p>

<p>The region pulsing is inspired by Daniel Mendler’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goggles</code> package,
which itself is a take on a common theme covered by many other such
packages.</p>

<h2>Style region highlights differently</h2>

<p>The following user options control the face of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-pulse-region-functions</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-region-face</code>:</strong> Face to pulse a region that has not changed.</li>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-region-change-face</code>:</strong> Face to pulse a region that has changed (added or removed).</li>
</ul>

<p>Pulsar defines several faces to get a nice style. Here is an example:</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">pulsar-region-face</span> <span class="ss">'pulsar-green</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">; unchanged regions are green</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">pulsar-region-change-face</span> <span class="ss">'pulsar-red</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">; changed regions are red</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2>Pulse on window state change</h2>

<p>An alternative to how Pulsar works out-of-the-box by reacting to the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-pulse-functions</code> is to check for changes to the window layout.
Users who wish to have this behaviour can set the new user option
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-pulse-on-window-change</code> to a non-nil value.</p>

<p>As there may be overlap between the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-pulse-functions</code> and the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pulsar-pulse-on-window-change</code>, users are advised to pick only one.
This is not a hard rule though: Pulsar will blithely highlight
everything if configured accordingly.</p>

<p>Thanks again to shipmints and Abdelhak Bougouffa for this
contribution. It is part of the aforementioned pull request 25.</p>
