<p>Though his movies may have benefited greatly from foreign audiences and backers, David Lynch was one of the most thoroughly American of all filmmakers. “Born Missoula, MT,” declared his Twitter bio, yet one never really associates him with a particular place in the United States (at least <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2015/10/david-lynch-draws-a-map-of-twin-peaks-to-help-pitch-the-show-to-abc.html">no extant one</a>). From Montana, the Lynch family moved to Idaho, then Washington, then North Carolina, then Virginia. The timing of that last stint proved culturally fortuitous indeed: living in the city of Alexandria, the eighteen-year-old Lynch was close enough to the nation’s capital to attend the very first concert <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdBJkXD1q0M">the Beatles played in North America, at the Washington Coliseum on February 11, 1964</a>.</p>
<p>“I was into rock and roll music, mainly Elvis Presley.” Lynch recalls this unsurprising fact in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuVTY9prYck">the clip above</a> (which would have been among the last interviews he gave before his <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2025/01/the-creative-genius-of-david-lynch.html">death a year ago</a>) from <em>Beatles ’64</em>, the Martin Scorsese-produced documentary on the Fab Four’s first U.S. tour.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have any idea how big this event was. And it was in a gigantic place where they had boxing matches. The Beatles were in the boxing ring. It was so loud, you can’t believe. Girls shuddering, crying, screaming their heart out. It was phenomenal.” That deafening crowd noise figures into most every account of the group’s Beatlemania-era shows — and played a decisive role in their permanent retreat into the studio a couple of years later.</p>
<p>Lynch surely would have understood the desire for artistic exploration and control that drove the Beatles’ concentration on making records. Even the sensibilities of his work and theirs had something in common, exhibiting as they both did the unlikely combination of popularity and experimentation.&nbsp; Somehow, David Lynch’s films and the Beatles’ albums could venture into bewildering obscurity and sentimental kitsch without losing coherence or critical respect. And dare one imagine that the experience of witnessing the American debut of what would become the most influential rock band of all time has given Lynch his appreciation — evident in his movies, but also his own recordings — for the power of music, which he calls “one of the most fantastic things”? Even if not, it must have been, well… surreal.</p>
