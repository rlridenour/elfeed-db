  <p>“We had spent way too much on programming that doesn’t bring in
any revenue,” Richard Grenell, a Trump ally and former ambassador
to Germany, <a href="https://washingtonreporter.news/p/interview-kennedy-centers-ric-grenell">told</a> the Washington Reporter, a conservative
media outlet, in late March. According to Grenell, the center
hadn’t been making money. It was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/08/13/trump-kennedy-center-honorees/">too woke</a> and
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/03/26/kennedy-center-social-impact-team-trump/">niche</a>. The new team was, in Trump’s words, going to make
it “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/video/trump-kennedy-center-board-phone-call-audio-tapper-ac360-digvid">hot</a>” again.</p>

<p>Nearly nine months after Trump became chair of the center and more
than a month into its main season, ticket sales for the Kennedy
Center’s three largest performance venues are the worst they’ve
been in years, according to a Washington Post analysis of
ticketing data from dozens of recent shows as well as past
seasons. Tens of thousands of seats have been left empty.</p>

<p>Since early September, 43 percent of tickets remained unsold for
the typical production. That means that, at most, 57 percent of
tickets were sold for the typical production — and some tickets
may have been “comps,” which are given away, often to staff
members or the press. That compares with 93 percent sold or comped
in fall 2024 and 80 percent in fall 2023.</p>
