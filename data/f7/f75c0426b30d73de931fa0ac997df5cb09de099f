<p>Ukraine and Russia carried out their first prisoner exchange in about five months after two days of U.S.-led talks in Abu Dhabi, with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff saying delegations agreed to swap 314 people. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said the negotiations were “not easy” but “constructive,” and Ukrainian officials thanked the United States and the United Arab Emirates for helping mediate. Several outlets described the exchange as 157-for-157. Russia’s defence ministry confirmed equal numbers, and Russian media showed those freed arriving in Belarus before heading to Russia for medical care and reunions. Zelensky said 157 Ukrainians returned on Thursday, including soldiers and civilians, and Ukrainian reporting highlighted that some of those freed had received life sentences in Russia and that some were defenders of Mariupol. The talks ended without a wider breakthrough on ending the war. Coverage pointed to continuing deadlock—especially over territory—alongside ongoing attacks hitting civilians and infrastructure.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/fQ8qL5tPK4vm8O9vZi38i2SEsIp71y13_T9fARgAbA5X9oV8Xv9_CQS6lb5qsd01FBpax7UVyCawHe9PNK0V3cDV75QMJ_r9cnI-oMdJ12GSTAXkWLkZa8_lsT1wZReg2C29RcnMILUCV3tIAviS3cJPeItV-Sjv4JDOZxJ998ZbVkSVMrZauU1uCwYfBin3Nalm1OmcuU4' alt='Workers at a Kyiv power plant damaged by recent missile and drone strikes.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>What’s next: In his post announcing the deal, Witkoff said talks would continue and that he expected “additional progress” “in the coming weeks,” while stressing that “significant work remains”.</li><li>Reconciling the tallies: Russia’s defence ministry said each side exchanged 157 people.
