<p>In the latest development in a growing U.S.-Denmark dispute, President Trump said he may impose tariffs on countries that do not support U.S. control of Greenland, arguing the Arctic territory is needed for national security. The remarks came as a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers traveled to Copenhagen to meet Danish and Greenlandic officials and signal that Congress does not back any move to take Greenland by force. Denmark and Greenland have continued to reject the takeover idea, even as the sides agreed to set up a working group to keep talks going.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/EfY3RAZTAZUkV5vP5fhzqlrO8_TbBKRqkeqvUQosEyGeng9TzIsKwBUPirOCfpqqvId2fWMuP_ADVqx_EGZ209r-ZU5UgsHzfUv_FaCQ7GoCaW9bcfpOm7gic-v3jCmWxhk-ybaDk-AAizhq-FluT2RAu9wzHTeMcYAd6w-yIB6QXIspK1pY1QdRKA6kqdAoPE_EoxwFMmh9XMkl9Bk-HKFhMHxSYWyHKVqdPztK5i6nhfE5T8fmzieyVz50Fq3D2MdEM--Thzrken4-NA' alt='President Donald Trump speaks at a White House event in Washington, Jan. 16, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Congressional leverage: Sen.
