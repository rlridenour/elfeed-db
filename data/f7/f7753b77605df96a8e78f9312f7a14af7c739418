<p>Prinzing and Vazquez incorporated these findings with further research they conducted and earlier this summer and published an <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/studying-philosophy-does-make-people-better-thinkers/45A7DE8F37BE4698265BD54490109D4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> about them in the <em>Journal of the American Philosophical Association</em>, discussed <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/07/14/studying-philosophy-makes-people-better-thinkers-further-data/">here</a> back in July.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve now, smartly, written an <a href="https://theconversation.com/studying-philosophy-does-make-people-better-thinkers-according-to-new-research-on-more-than-600-000-college-grads-262681" target="_blank" rel="noopener">op-ed</a> about their research for <em>The Conversation</em>. Many news venues republish articles from <em>The Conversation</em>, and the piece by Prinzing and Vazquez is being widely reprinted, usually with a headline that includes some variant on the phrase &#8220;studying philosophy makes people better thinkers&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is great publicity for philosophy. Philosophy departments should be sharing this article far and wide&#8212;posting it on their websites, emailing it to their students, printing out copies for major fairs, etc., not to mention showing it to their deans, provosts, and presidents.</p>
<p>Philosophers and philosophy departments have long claimed that studying philosophy improves one&#8217;s critical thinking skills. Yet apart from inconclusive correlations between majoring in philosophy and standardized test scores, there has been precious little offered in the way of empirical evidence. (One exception to this, from a few years ago, is &#8220;<a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/07/14/philosophy-majors-high-standardized-test-scores/">Philosophy Majors &amp; High Standardized Test Scores: Not Just Correlation</a>&#8221; by <a href="https://shc.academia.edu/ThomasMetcalf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Metcalf</a> of Spring Hill College.)</p>
<p>As valuable as this kind of work can be&#8212;especially when philosophy departments are worried about <a href="https://dailynous.com/category/cuts-and-threats-to-philosophy-programs/">cuts or elimination</a>&#8212;some people have expressed some dissatisfaction with the way Prinzing and Vazquez go about making their case. (A brief explanation of their approach and findings is below.)</p>
<p>In a conversation on social media about that, <a href="https://www.chriswsurprenant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Surprenant</a> (University of New Orleans) asked the following question, which seemed to me worth putting to all of you:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><em>Let&#8217;s say you had an unlimited budget and access to students. How would you design a project that tested whether or not taking philosophy courses makes people better thinkers?</em></strong></p>
<p>A brainstorming session on this could be useful. With luck, there will be some worthwhile, practicable ideas that, with further luck, could be funded and tried. Let&#8217;s hear your suggestions!</p>

<p><em>Information about Prinzing and Vazquez&#8217;s research:</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">Prinzing and Vazquez look at traits indexed by the Habits of Mind scale (a measure of intellectual dispositions) and performance on the GRE and LSAT. For the Habits of Mind scale, they rely on student self-reports. Here are the results as reported in their October 2024 report:</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #808080;">For the standardized tests, they control for selection effects by comparing SAT scores (taken before college) and GRE and LSAT scores (taken during or after having majored in a topic) and seeing which majors showed the greatest improvement:</span></p>
