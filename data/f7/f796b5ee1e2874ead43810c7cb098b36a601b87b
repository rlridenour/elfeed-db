the style of the Emacs cursor on graphical terminals. The intent is to
allow the user to define preset configurations such as “block with
slow blinking” or “bar with fast blinking” and set them on demand. The
use-case for such presets is to adapt to evolving interface
requirements and concomitant levels of expected comfort, such as in
the difference between writing and reading.</p>

<h2>Version 1.1.0 on 2024-09-14</h2>

<p>Cursory is in a stable state. This version includes quality-of-life
refinements.</p>

<h3>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cursory-mode</code> simplifies how the state is stored</h3>

<p>Cursory has functions to store and restore its state. In previous
versions, we would document how to use those by adding them to the
relevant hooks. This approach still works, though we now provide an
easier way to achieve the same result: just enable the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cursory-mode</code>.</p>

<p>Technically, all this does is to set the hooks if enabled, and unsets
them if disabled.</p>

<p>The “restore” phase is the same as before. For example:</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; Set last preset, if available, or fall back to the `bar' preset</span>
<span class="c1">;; from the `cursory-presets'.</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">cursory-set-preset</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">or</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">cursory-restore-latest-preset</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ss">'bar</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cursory-set-preset-hook</code></h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cursory-set-preset-hook</code> is a normal hook (where functions are
invoked without any arguments), which is called after the command
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cursory-set-preset</code>. Here are some ideas on how to use it:</p>

<div class="language-elisp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">;; Imagine you have a preset where you want minimal cursor styles.</span>
<span class="c1">;; You call this `focus' and want when you switch to it to change the</span>
<span class="c1">;; cursor color.</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">my-cursory-change-color</span> <span class="p">()</span>
<span class="s">"Change to a subtle color when the `focus' Cursory preset is selected."</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">eq</span> <span class="nv">cursory-last-selected-preset</span> <span class="ss">'focus</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">set-face-background</span> <span class="ss">'cursor</span> <span class="s">"#999999"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">face-spec-recalc</span> <span class="ss">'cursor</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="c1">;; Here we just show how to disable a given mode.  Of course, we can</span>
<span class="c1">;; have something more sophisticated, which stores the last value and</span>
<span class="c1">;; restores it if the condition we are testing for here is not met.</span>
<span class="c1">;; Keeping it simple for now.</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">my-cursory-change-color-disable-line-numbers</span> <span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="s">"Disable line numbers if the Cursory preset is `presentation' or `focus'."</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">memq</span> <span class="nv">cursory-last-selected-preset</span> <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">presentation</span> <span class="nv">focus</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">display-line-numbers-mode</span> <span class="mi">-1</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I am happy to include more examples here, if users have any questions.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a dependency for older Emacs versions. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subr-x</code>, which is
built into Emacs, needs to be explicitly loaded at compile time.
This makes some parts of the code work as expected. Thanks to Mehdi
Khawari for reporting the problem and Nicholas Vollmer for
suggesting this change. The exchange took place in issue 1:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/cursory/issues/1">https://github.com/protesilaos/cursory/issues/1</a>. Users should
already have this change, as I published a minor release for it
(version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added some missing metadata to the manual. This is useful for the
indices and COPYING section.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Updated the relevant links to the package sources. The main
repository is now on GitHub.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
