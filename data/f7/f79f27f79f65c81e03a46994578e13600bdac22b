Apple introduced the 2024 &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models back in September, and it is able to charge them at up to 25W. For the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 models to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, charging is capped at 15W. Apple replaced all of its &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; chargers with the new model, and now only sells the 2024 version.<br/>
<br/>
Firmware updates are released quietly over the air, and Apple does not provide release notes. We don't know what new features or bug fixes might be included in the software.<br/>
