<p>Japan’s Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) paused the restart process for Unit 6 at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power station in Niigata after an alarm sounded during start-up procedures, hours after the process began. TEPCO said the reactor remained stable and that there was no radioactive impact outside the plant while it investigates malfunctioning monitoring/electrical equipment. The halt underscores Japan’s cautious, step-by-step approach to bringing nuclear capacity back online after years of heightened scrutiny and public debate following the 2011 Fukushima disaster.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/a8LNTVUH4JDctmq_oBSSZQH1lFuk0kT8gp9tsU-UrMUUc95kySN-k-wq_uRs0N6CGcUCV9Z4-hCc8H5_KXsXeMcE6YAcq2S2T1nLVambD3hJ' alt='Central control room during Unit 6 start-up procedures at TEPCO’s Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, Jan 21, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Planned shutdown: TEPCO said it reinserted the control rods in a planned manner once it became clear troubleshooting would take time.</li><li>Repair timeline: Site superintendent Takeyuki Inagaki told reporters the issue likely would not be fixed “within a day or two,” and TEPCO could not yet say how long it would take.</li><li>Earlier delay: The restart had already slipped from Tuesday after a separate technical issue involving control-rod removal was detected last weekend and resolved on Sunday, according to TEPCO.</li><li>Scale of plant: Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is described as the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, though only one of its seven reactors was in the restart process.</li><li>Energy policy backdrop: RT reported Japan has moved in recent years to reactivate idled nuclear plants in part to stabilize energy prices after the post-2011 shutdowns.</li></ul><blockquote>We don’t expect this to be solved within a day or two.
