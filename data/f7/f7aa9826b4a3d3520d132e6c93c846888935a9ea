<p>Elon Musk, Friday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Join @xAI and help build a purely AI software company called
Macrohard. It’s a tongue-in-cheek name, but the project is
very real!</p>

<p>In principle, given that software companies like Microsoft do not
themselves manufacture any physical hardware, it should be
possible to simulate them entirely with AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it’s “a purely AI software company” why do they need to hire anyone?</p>
