<p>In the latest development in the Gaza hostage file, the International Committee of the Red Cross transferred a coffin from Gaza to Israeli forces on Tuesday, and Israel has now confirmed the remains are those of 48-year-old hostage Dror Or. Or, a father from Kibbutz Be’eri who worked in the community dairy, was abducted during the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which his wife Yonat was killed and several of their children were taken hostage. Two of his children, Noam and Alma, were released alive in a hostage-prisoner swap two years ago to the day of the remains’ handover, while another child, Hagar, was killed in the 2023 assault according to Israeli accounts. The transfer of Or’s body, which came via Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, leaves the remains of two deceased hostages still believed to be held in Gaza several weeks after a US-brokered ceasefire took effect. For Or’s family and community, identification of his remains, now undergoing forensic examination in Israel, closes one painful chapter while wider talks in Cairo continue over the final hostages and broader arrangements between Israel and Palestinian factions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/JhTRpa2ykQK-0zDaZMeDD-47-LqGFrAX8G05nBxu7CY8SrbGPQSkZ-UgzSQO4pGbT_6gXAfdsvxPE9OhkFjzd0NGqar-nE9tDv0Fbpal1gLLAaVbKRWFwjUcYBlYkFG4BRWPG4X_j3RP8kfkWyHOJ3OUIrzcWtgykxdGkH6m27WrYdyJ1sIx29mMriuErCoOAT9Ty7-0vcaMxQ' alt='A Red Cross convoy in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, believed to be carrying the remains of an Israeli hostage for transfer to Israel.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Role of Red Cross: The International Committee of the Red Cross acted as intermediary for the handover, transporting the coffin from Gaza to Israeli authorities at the Kerem Shalom crossing before it was moved to a medical facility for examination.</li><li>Ceasefire framework: The return of Or’s remains forms part of a wider US-brokered ceasefire and hostage-release arrangement under which Hamas and allied groups have been transferring remaining captives and bodies since the deal took effect on 10 October.</li><li>Remaining deceased hostages: Before this transfer, Israel assessed that the bodies of three dead hostages—two Israeli citizens and one Thai national—were still in Gaza; following Or’s identification, officials now say two deceased hostages’ remains are believed to remain there.</li><li>Cairo negotiations: Parallel to the remains’ return, Egyptian-mediated discussions in Cairo have been focusing on implementing ceasefire terms, resolving the fate of the final hostages and remains, and shaping post-conflict arrangements in Gaza.</li><li>Kibbutz Be’eri story: Or was known in Kibbutz Be’eri as a dedicated cheesemaker and community volunteer, and his home was among those devastated in the 7 October assault that left dozens of residents dead or kidnapped according to Israeli figures.</li></ul><blockquote>We will continue to act with determination to return all our hostages and missing, both the living and the dead, to their families and to the State of Israel. - Benjamin Netanyahu</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Israeli government: Israeli officials framed the handover as part of their ongoing commitment to bring home every hostage and missing person, living or dead, and emphasized that efforts would continue until the remaining captives and bodies are returned.
