<p>In Washington on Monday, President Trump said he had not ruled out putting U.S. forces on the ground in Venezuela while also saying he would be willing to hear directly from President Nicolás Maduro about proposals to avert further escalation. Reporting notes the United States has been moving forces into the Caribbean, a buildup that has increased the prospect of military action in the region. Venezuelan President Maduro responded by saying he was open to &quot;face-to-face&quot; dialogue and publicly challenged Trump to meet in person. Observers characterized the exchange as mixed messaging — a diplomatic opening alongside retained military options — which multiple outlets highlighted.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/L2rIOz4hyC4w_BqVW5TRL_IRMYeIwFYoii4NKplZ5qZO-REoB-hVGS_8wP319Arq-fHbl4u949v_8RzNoBIhq_aKhqRNHSxkX_gf_iWuBsNNP2TgZtW2MS_8_URV7H81WkUTkwFUjkXNH45uWCieXrXhSBP0b2xXgjqy9Q3D_1ESpeD7QMd1PT_6Y8LYTw' alt='President Trump in the Oval Office on Monday; he raised the possibility of renewed engagement with Venezuela while keeping military options on the table' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Force details: News reports describe a U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean but do not provide troop numbers or unit identifications.</li><li>Timing caveat: Trump said he would be open to speaking with Maduro &#x27;at a certain time,&#x27; signaling conditional diplomacy rather than an immediate negotiation.</li><li>Maduro&#x27;s stance: Maduro maintained that any future dialogue must be &#x27;face to face&#x27; and publicly dared Trump to meet him in person.</li><li>Policy flip: Reporting notes the president&#x27;s comments came after he had paused recent diplomatic efforts, a shift that outlets described as mixed messaging about U.S. intent.</li></ul><blockquote>I don’t rule out anything, we just have to take care of Venezuela, - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He said he would not rule out putting American personnel &#x27;on the ground&#x27; in Venezuela and indicated willingness to speak directly with Maduro &#x27;at a certain time&#x27;.
