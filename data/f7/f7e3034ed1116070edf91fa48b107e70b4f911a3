<p>μKanren (&ldquo;micro-Kanren&rdquo;) is a tiny, embeddable logic programming language. It&rsquo;s easy to understand and implement in almost any language. It&rsquo;s a great case study of an embedded language: unlike other common &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; languages like SQL or regex, which normally are represented as just plain-old strings, μKanren takes more advantage of the host language&rsquo;s features.</p>
<p>I recommend reading <a href="http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf">the original paper</a>: it&rsquo;s short, well-written, and easy to understand.</p>
<p>I did a write-up which you can read <a href="https://codeberg.org/ashton314/microKanren">on Codeberg</a>. The README is my set of notes that I made while walking through the implementation of the paper, and the repository contains an implementation in <a href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>. I&rsquo;ve included some fun use cases like a type checker/inference engine that takes up only 37 lines of code!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fun little language, and I might be able to use it at work soon actually. It&rsquo;s definitely specialized for solving a particular class of problem, but you might be surprised how many things fall into that category. Have you used μKanren? <a href="https://lambdaland.org/about/#contact">Drop me a line</a>—I&rsquo;d love to hear about it!</p>
