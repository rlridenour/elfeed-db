Apple's Pro Display XDR has now been on the market for over five years, and while persistent rumors hint at a second-generation model, surprisingly little definitive information has emerged about Apple's plans for its premier external monitor. Here's everything we know so far.<br/>
<br/>

In December 2022, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> reported that Apple was developing an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/">updated iteration of the Pro Display XDR</a>, this time incorporating an Apple silicon chip, presumably to enable additional functionality. The Studio Display contains an A13 Bionic chip to power its built-in webcam, spatial audio, and always-on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Since the original Pro Display XDR lacks any of these smart capabilities, it stands to reason that its successor could gain a built-in camera, microphone array, high-fidelity speakers, and perhaps even support for new software features like Center Stage video framing, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> for Mac, or automatic color calibration based on ambient lighting conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Hardware improvements are also expected. A second-generation Pro Display XDR could feature a higher refresh rate, Thunderbolt 5 connectivity for faster data throughput, and even a shift to OLED or hybrid OLED/QD-OLED panels. OLED technology would offer significantly better contrast ratios, deeper blacks, and lower power consumption, making it even better at professional color work. <br/>
<br/>
In July 2023, Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/next-pro-display-xdr-rumor-recap/">reaffirmed</a> that Apple was continuing development on several next-generation external monitors, but cautioned that releases were unlikely before late 2024 at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
In November 2024, a report from Display Supply Chain Consultants analyst Ross Young said that the next Pro Display XDR may adopt the same quantum-dot display technology now seen in the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models. According to Young, these newer quantum-dot films offer an equal or better color gamut and superior motion performance compared to the older KSF phosphor film used in the current Pro Display XDR and previous &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/m4-macbook-pro-quantum-dot/">Young's report</a> suggested that the Pro Display XDR 2 could boast even more precise color accuracy, faster response times, and better consistency.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/16/pro-display-xdr-2-and-larger-imac-rumors/">Gurman noted</a> that a new Pro Display XDR was currently "less of a priority" for Apple, given its niche market and premium price tag. Nonetheless, he revealed in March that Apple is actively <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-working-on-mystery-new-display/">developing a new display</a> codenamed J527, intended to launch alongside a second-generation Studio Display. This mystery monitor could turn out to be the long-awaited Pro Display XDR successor.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, no further leaks about the device have surfaced. While the launch timeline remains uncertain, it is plausible that Apple could unveil the second-generation Pro Display XDR alongside refreshed high-end Macs—particularly a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> model. The current Pro Display XDR was released alongside the 2019 &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/29/pro-display-xdr-2-rumors-and-features/">Apple&#039;s Pro Display XDR 2: Rumors, Features, and What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-pro-display-xdr-2-rumors-features-and-what-to-expect.2456179/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
