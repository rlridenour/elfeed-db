This integration allows you to view and change modes (Stay, Away, and Disarm) directly from an Ecobee smart thermostat's tile in the Home app, or by using Siri voice commands on an iPhone or iPad. You can also create HomeKit automations (such as "arm at 10 PM, disarm at 7 AM"), and receive push notifications for mode changes.<br/>
<br/>
Ecobee's <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-thermostats/smart-thermostat-premium/">Smart Thermostat Premium</a> can act as a security hub, eliminating the need to buy a standalone home security device. The thermostat can be paired with Ecobee's cameras and sensors, providing you with alerts for unexpected motion and entry, reminders to arm your home, smoke alarm detection, and more. In the U.S., Ecobee's <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-security/#Plans">Smart Security plan</a> costs &#36;5 per month, or &#36;10 per month with 24/7 professional monitoring.<br/>
