</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
In which hard-lessons are learned after witholding information.
</p>
        <p>Before I get going, I need to establish a traveling procedure: namely barrier
generation.  And before that, as I think about play, Sir Weydlyn and Squire
Kelwun have ended a Phase of the day in the Wilderness.  Meaning <em>Wilderness
Roll</em>.</p>
<p>I make a Wilderness Roll (4) and all is clear.  I also wonder if Sir Weydlyn or
Squire Kelwun can discern if their captives are eager or nervous to head to the
tower.</p>
<p>I decide to give them both a Clarity save to notice.  Kelwun notices, but
Weydlyn does not.  Now does he make mention of it to Weydlyn or the others?  For
the time being, I think it is unlikely.  I <em>Ask the Stars</em>, they respond with “No
but…” I think after a couple hours, Weydlyn notices something off about Kelwun.
Enough for us to cross from one Hex to another.</p>
<h1 id="establishing-a-procedure-for-barrier-generation-while-traveling">Establishing a Procedure for Barrier Generation while Traveling</h1>
<p>I’ll be adding what follows to my Campaign Notebook, a document separate from
the narrative play.  However, I want to share this work as it may be useful
for others playing <cite><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514996/mythic-bastionland?affiliate_id=318171">Mythic Bastionland</a></cite> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Mythic Bastionland”" title="Other site-wide references of “Mythic Bastionland”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-MYTHIC-BASTIONLAND">&#128214;</a></small>
.</p>
<p>I’m considering the procedure for placing “just in time” barriers while a
character travels the land.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

Some Hexes have a Barrier on one or more of their edges, typically a sudden
altitude change or impassible feature.  These cannot normally be travelled
through.  For a typical Realm, place a number of Barriers equal to one sixth of
your total Hexes.

<footer>&mdash;<cite>Mythic Bastionland</cite>
page 14

</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>My read of the rules is that Barriers are revealed to players as they encounter
them on their travels.  This read is reinforced by the <a href="https://mythic.bastionland.tools/map">Realm Map</a> generator hides
the barriers on the player’s map.</p>
<p>Going by the book there are 144 Hexes in the Realm, meaning there are 24
barriers.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

Travel through a Barrier is not normally possible, though locals might know a
way.  Attempting to travel through a Barrier wasts that Phase of the day, but
still causes a Wilderness Roll.

<footer>&mdash;<cite>Mythic Bastionland</cite>
page 18

</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>I read the above to mean that a barrier is applicable when leaving or arriving
from that side of the Hex.  There are 468 edges in a 12 by 12 Realm.  Of those
96 are along the exterior border of the Realm.  Leaving 372 edges on which there
might be a barrier.  Meaning that Sir Weydlyn has a 2 in 31 chance of
encountering a barrier when they cross their first Hex.  Which comes out to a
6.45% chance.</p>
<p>Thinking about about the dice rolls I have two procedures that come to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roll a d6 + d12; when the 6-sided dice is a 1 and the 12-sided is 1 through 5,
there’s a barrier.  This is generates a barrier 6.94%.</li>
<li>Roll a d8 + d6; when the 8-sided die is a 1 and the 6-sided die is 1 through
3, there’s a barrier.  This generates a barrier 6.25% of the time.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an alternative, were I to alternate procedures with each step, that would
create a 6.60% chance, which gets closer; but definitely makes things more
fiddly.</p>
<p>Stepping back, I’ve already said the River is a known barrier.  So, lets go with
the lower probability.  We’ll check the first time the character attempts to
cross, and record that result for future reference.</p>
<h1 id="setting-out">Setting Out</h1>
<p>Sir Weydlyn on Ingot and Squire Kelwun with his three prisoners (and six riding
horses) head south east to the tower.  They’ve spent the morning at Tompot’s
academy, eat a meager meal, and depart.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>I grab some dice and roll for a barrier between hex <code>9,1</code> and hex <code>9,1</code>.  I was
hoping, a bit, that there would be a barrier…but the dice said no.  For future
reference, until I encounter tooling issues, the top left-most corner is <code>0,0</code> and
moving right increments the first digit.</small></p>
</section>

<p>While traveling the land shifts from grey plains to overgrown, uneasing Weydlyn.
The dear trail makes for easier travel, avoiding the worst of the overgrowth.
Ahead, the trail appears to veer north avoiding a large knot of thickets that
splays onto the plain.</p>
<p>“Squire Kelwun, I noticed that you are a bit on edge.  These tall grasses
nipping at more than your stirrups?  Maybe your spirit?”</p>
<p>Kelwun, eyes darting amongst the prisoners, as though rechecking that he’s tied
the knots suitably, answers, “Umm, no its not that,” he says trailing off, as
though catching some unexpected movement amongst his prisoners.</p>
<p>“Then what pray tell?”</p>
<p>“I’m just a bit busy keeping my eye on the prisoners.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Your</em> prisoners,&rdquo; reiterates Sir Weydlyn.</p>
<p>“Yes, <em>my</em> prisoners.  Just making sure their bonds are well suited.  They…”</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>At this point, I consider what Kelwun has noticed of the prisoners.  “Are the
<i class="dfn">fancy bandits</i> eager to return to the tower?” I honestly don’t know.  So instead
of <i class="dfn">Asking the Stars</i> I’ll make a Luck Roll, and get a Crisis…something
immediately bad.</small></p>
</section>

<p>“…don’t seem to be trying to escape,” says Kelwun.</p>
<p>Sir Weydlyn draws a deep breath, leans towards Ingot’s head, running his fingers
across the dark polished steel of Ingot’s curled horned helm, lazily asking,
“and?”</p>
<p>“And, that concerns me.  We know them to be false.  And to not attempt escape,
well that, I dare think, means,” says Kelwun, as the three bandits each wince
and test their bonds, “we’re probably returning them to welcoming arms.”</p>
<p>Weydlyn halts Ingot, and locks his smouldering gaze with Kelwun, again asking
“and?”</p>
<p>That question hangs for a moment, as one of the three bandit’s eyes dart towards
the thicket.</p>
<p>“And, I think we should be prepared.  Because, I think they’ve been nudging us.”</p>
<p>The other bandits notice the first.  They squint tilting their heads forward
just a bit.</p>
<p>“Prepared?  And you’re now telling me this?  No.  Don’t answer.  We could be
walking into a trap.”</p>
<p>Hisses split the sky, as the bandits dive off the deer trail into the tall
overgrown grass, and arrows fly.</p>
<h1 id="ambuscade">Ambuscade</h1>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>
I check Weydlyn and Kelwun’s Clarity, both fail.  No Guard for them.  Four
arrows fly at Weydlyn and 1 at Kelwun (I chose a d4 for each of them).

</small></p>
<p><small>
Both have sustained a wound.  I check Kelwun’s morale, and he’s ready to stay
and fight.
</small></p>
<p><small>
Without access to Feats, Weydlyn is far less dangerous.
</small></p>

</section>

<p>An arrow pieces Kelwun’s thigh as he cries out.  Another finds purchase between
the plates of Weydlyn’s armor, sinking into the meat of his shoulder.</p>
<p>Kelwun looks to Weydlyn, reaching for his javelin, noting that Weydlyn is
pulling on Ingot’s reins for a hard turn.  Seeing this, both knight and squire
spur their horses into a galloping retreat.</p>
<p>As hooves thunder amongst the tall grass, arrows again fly.</p>

</dl>
</section>

<p>An arrow tears across Weydlyn’s jaw; a brief memory flashes of his forging of
Ingot’s helmet; he snarls.  And lowers himself spurring Ingot on.  Gazing over
his shoulder again, he sees an arrow sink into Kelwum’s neck.  Weydlyn’s gaze
holds a moment longer, as Kelwum slumps, bounces, then slides and caroms off of
his horse.  A horse pressing forward, spooked, and pulling at a leg still
stirrup bound.</p>
<p>Both horse and Weydlyn’s gaze shake free of Kelwum’s battered body.  Growling
and muttering a curse, Weydlyn rides on, steering Ingot southwest.</p>
<section class="inline-comments">
<p><small>
Weydlyn has a chance to shake off his Fatigue.  And ends this portion of the day
in the Wilderness.  I get a 4 on my Wilderness Roll; no events.  (Certainly not
the Tower landmark).
</small></p>
<p><small>
Reading Travel rules, Weydlyn’s spent the morning at Tompot’s and the afternoon
in <code>9,1</code> and fleeing.  Both were done as a Trek (e.g. 1 Hex).  So he’ll be
camping outside; meaning another Wilderness Roll: “Encounter the next Omen from
the nearest Myth.”
</small></p>

</section>

<h1 id="procedure-for-myth-when-only-having-a-player-facing-map">Procedure for Myth when Only Having a Player Facing Map</h1>
<p>In <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2025/12/08/forged-from-the-worst-session-1/">Forged from the Worst: Session 1</a> Seer Tompot established that The Beast is on
the western shores of the silver lake.  That could mean the Beast is no more
than 2 squares away, or as far as 5.  <em>Asking the Stars</em> it seems likely that the
Beast is the nearest Myth to <code>9,1</code> Hex: “No but…”  Maybe equidistant?  We’ll hold
this lightly.</p>
<p>I roll a random established Myth, and get “The Mountain.”  Well, a mountain in
the plains.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

Fur-clad monks pray toward the Mountain scattering stones, water, and coals in
its direction.  They warn that only the worthy can climb it.

<footer>&mdash;<cite>Mystic Bastionland</cite>

</blockquote>

<p>And that direction?  South of <code>9,1</code>.  This is enough to continue play.</p>
<h1 id="an-evening-of-contemplation">An Evening of Contemplation</h1>
<p>Sitting beside a small campfire, Weydlyn casts his gaze to Ingot and and
Kelwum’s horse—he never did learn its name.  Both graze after a hard afternoon
of riding.  Weydlyn thinks about when he first met Kelwum.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> I <em>Ask the Stars</em> for their Signs and Positions: The Traveller (wandering -

</small>
</p>
<p>He had found Kelwum in the village streets, a blubbering mess, carrying on about
his mother marrying a wicked man—a man that was scheming to kill Kelwum.  Just
as he had killed others.  Tossing noose over gallows and kicking out the stool.
Or so that’s what Kelwum said and Weydlyn remembered.  Kelwum begged Sir Weydlyn
to take him on as a squire.</p>
<p>Weydlyn accepted, and being neither kind nor wicked towards Kelwum, set about
working Kelwum as one might work steel on the forge.  Folding fire and strength
into his squire’s heart and soul.</p>
<p>No tears came as Weydlyn looked into the embers of a fading fire.  The embers
throbbed and pulsed from muted burgundy to a glowing brilliant crimson.
Weydlyn’s mind blank as he stared deeper into the eye of the fire.</p>
<p>Was it an hour or a minute when he next heard Ingot and that other horse neigh.
Reaching for his bolt-guisarme, Wedylyn rose, cursing as the smouldering echoes
were all he could see.</p>
<p>A weak poetic voice in the darkness spoke, “Traveler, might we join you by your
fire?  We too are travelers, no pilgrims, seeking an evening of warmth and
rest.”</p>
<p>As Weydlyn’s eyes adjusted, he saw 3 fur-clad monks bowing deep, each holding a
bowl; one shimmering a bit as though catching the evening stars; the second
smouldering embers and coal, the last filled with something unknown.</p>
<p>Weydlyn snuffed, raising hand to chin and almost reaching to touch his field
dressed jaw.  His shoulder ached, as though pleading for soft bed and warm
hearth.</p>
<p>“Mayhaps, but answer me this.  The night is warm, yet you fur clad.  Why is that
so?”</p>
<p>“Ah, we are on a holy journey,” said another, as each reached into their bowl
grabbed a pinch and cast it towards the campfire, “to the mountain, and in our
supplication we hope it deems us worthy to ascend.”</p>
<p>“A mountain you say?  To the south?  Those mountains are many leagues away.
West of the great river.”</p>
<p>“Oh not those, for there is one near.  One that only the worthy may ascend,”
says the third, who’s face looked as weather pocked and worn stone.</p>
<p>Weydlyn nods, thinking of his map of the realm tucked into his saddle bags.
Thinking to himself that there is no mountain on this side of the river.</p>
<p>“Good monks, my fire has dwindled, providing poor company for this evening.  Let
us stoke the flames and share heart warming stories of the day.”</p>
<p>The three bow graciously and they all set about fueling the fire.  Weydlyn’s
heart warms, for it is in the fire where he finds his solace.</p>
<h1 id="reflections">Reflections</h1>
<p>First, pour one out for Squire Kelwum.  He was a tender heart, caught between a
avoiding unwarranted violence and trying to “toughen up.”  I’d imagine he chose
to withhold information from Weydlyn, in part to avoid criticism.</p>
<p>Second, Weydlyn’s a dick.  And I felt him turning his discomfort into a question
of Kelwum as one of those “would rather pick at someone than go to therapy”
moments.</p>
<p>I’m also quite satisfied with treating any knowledge Kelwum had as opaque to
Weydlyn; that is Kelwum was filling a traditional <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character">Non-Player Character</a></span> (<abbr title="Non-Player Character">NPC</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Non-Player Character”" title="Other site-wide references of “Non-Player Character”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-GLOSSARY-NPC">&#128214;</a></small>)
 role.</p>
<p>I really love using Oracles to nudge things into a state of conflict, and felt
that I had a reasonable flow.  Made personally more interesting by withholding
information and asking questions of the stars.</p>
<p>I did not, however, ask the Oracle for the nature of the Crisis.  It felt
obvious.  The prisoner’s attempting an escape against two mounted combatants did
not feel correct.  I suppose I could’ve <em>Asked the Stars</em> for a Sign.  But the
ambush felt right.  And I can see a situation in which Sir Weydlyn would raise a
warband to confront this brigandry.</p>
<p>Without Guard available, the stakes felt high.  And I got a better sense of just
how delicate the characters are.  For the second volley, I chose to randomize
but with a likely lower number of arrows.  The thought being that the assailants
were likely also responding to the prisoners.  Yet the same number of arrows
flew.  So perhaps there were more than 5?</p>
<p>I didn’t give any consideration of Weydlyn would attempt to return for Kelwum.
It felt as though grim pragmatism would lead Weydlyn on.</p>
<p>For Weydlyn’s memory of Kelwum, I consulted the stars, rolled on a sparks table,
and reincorporated his background.  Also, it is quite clear that Weydlyn is
inattentive.</p>
<p>Playing in a world emerging—in which I’m trying to maintain ignorance of what
would be behind the screen—is a fun little puzzle to resolve.</p>
