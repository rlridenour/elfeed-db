<p>In the latest development, President Trump said the U.S. will impose an additional 10% import tariff from February 1 on goods from eight European countries—Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and the UK—linking the move to U.S. demands to be allowed to buy Greenland. Trump said the tariff rate would rise to 25% on June 1 if no deal is reached. European leaders and the targeted governments rejected the pressure as an attack on sovereignty and warned of a “dangerous downward spiral” in transatlantic ties, while also signalling they prefer dialogue first to avoid a wider trade war. The dispute is playing out alongside high-level diplomacy this week, including the World Economic Forum in Davos, where leaders are expected to discuss the standoff and broader security issues.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/UFXWjOKPBur8chtbnciteaYYMGXFV6OEhSEnDFWMdZkY0rDW7ga3a-1iDnf4cRyaqXVzzAjHTJAQhv8LWOUd3dF4cEJyVutL-BZpVvwUeHg3xvV2dATdP4qqxRF-_FWsQV9aNtG4hk78-xfLX8EpvE6P0it6Wmlin9HbdNzzkIxdYH8ebR2REA7v3t3G9qCoFZsZ54oSTkx8KMVv2ACg-SHwFIR0uBE_Fsy0kzKBXDK8' alt='A protest against President Trump in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, on Saturday.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>EU toolbox: EU diplomats discussed holding the Anti-Coercion Instrument (often dubbed the bloc’s “trade bazooka”) in reserve while preparing other countermeasures if U.S. tariffs take effect.</li><li>Retaliation list: European officials have been weighing a retaliatory tariff package valued around €93 billion (about $108 billion), including the possibility of restricting U.S. companies’ market access as leverage ahead of talks.</li><li>Market ripple: The confrontation rattled investors, with reports of stock declines and gold hitting a record as traders priced in renewed U.S.-Europe trade friction.</li><li>UK de-escalation: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for “calm discussion” among allies and said Greenland’s future should be decided by Greenlanders and Denmark, while also arguing tariffs should not be used against allies.</li><li>Arctic rationale: Trump and U.S. officials have framed Greenland as strategically vital in the Arctic due to security concerns involving Russia and China—claims Moscow and Beijing have rejected, according to reports.</li></ul><blockquote>Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. - Leaders of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>U.S. administration (President Trump): The White House links new tariffs to a demand that the U.S. be allowed to buy Greenland and argues the move is necessary to address perceived Arctic security threats.
