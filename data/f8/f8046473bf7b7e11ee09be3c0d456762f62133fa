Apple this week <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tvos/whats-new/">introduced</a> a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/automaticsigninapi">Automatic Sign-In API</a>, which will make it easier to sign in to apps across multiple Apple devices.<br/>

Starting with Apple's latest software releases, such as iOS 26 and tvOS 26, you will be able to sign in to a supported app on one Apple device and automatically be signed in to the app on other Apple devices. For example, if you sign in to the Disney+ app on your iPhone, you would automatically be signed in to the Disney+ app on your Apple TV. However, it will take time for developers to begin implementing this functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says this feature will eliminate the need to re-enter usernames and passwords across its software platforms, by linking app logins to a user's Apple Account.<br/>

tvOS 26 is currently available in beta.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/tvos-26-automatic-sign-in/">tvOS 26 Introduces Automatic Sign-In Feature for Apple TV Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tvos-26-introduces-automatic-sign-in-feature-for-apple-tv-apps.2458958/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
