<p>Pakistan has intensified security operations across Balochistan after coordinated suicide bombings and gun assaults struck multiple cities in the province, including the capital, Quetta. Authorities reported significant civilian and security-force casualties from the attacks, while the military and provincial leadership said their counter-operations killed a large number of alleged attackers over roughly 40 hours. Several reports say the banned Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the assaults, which targeted people and infrastructure and renewed attention on long-running unrest in the region.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/0T_TmHUCjIDEG6Av6BEhdlLWHq0GGXKy4aWgqfJKzIwSwUqtNoyaPtE9R9TV4wfGuLl6smriWt2e1P1P_QLKXW60IXUPTi3ixIweYjPumDE6S9GCnDG4AZa8ZCygRsc7HJ159lXs47L6StgqqsvkmVLT8eAamK5utoRvoHiefkEhOZbevhPZzkp9kbyxJF01v5k04xmQ9E_Y167lG-5wkxDZhI7kg7Ej9pTvk64yb3TXib_DdF6hTrNoeYwcHJCiILiRpf98dprmqtwJvQ' alt='A man stands beside burnt vehicles inside a torched police station on the outskirts of Quetta on February 1, 2026, a day after an attack by Baloch separatists.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Spread of violence: Pakistani forces said militants hit or operated around Quetta as well as Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni, describing the incidents as attempts to disrupt peace.</li><li>Cross-border claims: Pakistan’s military and officials described the attackers as “Indian-backed” or “Indian-sponsored,” while India’s Ministry of External Affairs rejected the allegation as baseless.</li><li>Investment backdrop: Several outlets noted Balochistan is resource-rich and a focus of Pakistan’s efforts to attract foreign investment in mining and minerals, making security conditions a key concern for economic plans.</li><li>Local situation update: Balochistan’s chief minister said calm had been restored a day after the assaults, as authorities continued sweeps and held bodies they said were militants.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pakistan military and officials: They say coordinated attacks across Balochistan prompted counterterrorism operations and allege the militants had external backing from India.
