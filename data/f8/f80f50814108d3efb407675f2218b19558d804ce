Apple is planning to reintroduce a premium leather-alternative case for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup, according to the leaker known as "<a href="https://majinbuofficial.com/new-iphone-17-simil-leather-cases-goodbye-finewoven/">Majin Bu</a>."<br/>

Following the discontinuation of its controversial FineWoven cases, Apple is apparently planning to debut a new attempt at a leather-alternative fabric case this year alongside the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup. The new synthetic fabric will reportedly feature a more technical and less luxurious design.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to FineWoven, the fabric is said to have a more rich, visible texture, as well as enhanced resistance to scratches and daily wear-and-tear. The material features a "rubbery, grippy texture," but feels less premium than its predecessor in favor of practicality, but questions still remain about its long-term durability.<br/>
<br/>
The new fabric cases will purportedly be available in green, orange, blue, and purple. They will also adhere to Apple's environmental goals. <br/>
<br/>
Moreover, there is also apparently the possibility of offering "Liquid Glass"-style cases, but Majin Bu provided no further information about what this could entail. It could be related to earlier rumors about a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/22/liquid-glass-color-iphone-17-pro/">Liquid Glass color option</a> for the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup itself, or perhaps be a new take on Apple's clear <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> case. The leaker also further reiterated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/18/iphone-17-lanyard-case-rumor/">rumors</a> that the silicone cases for the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup will feature a lanyard loop.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/finewoven/">FineWoven</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/19/apple-to-introduce-finewoven-successor/">Apple Rumored to Introduce FineWoven Successor With iPhone 17</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-rumored-to-introduce-finewoven-successor-with-iphone-17.2463627/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
