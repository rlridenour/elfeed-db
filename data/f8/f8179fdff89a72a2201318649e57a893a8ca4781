<p>China reported that its 2025 trade surplus rose to nearly $1.2 trillion, the largest on record, as exporters increased shipments to markets outside the United States even as U.S.-bound exports slowed under higher tariffs imposed by President Trump. Multiple outlets linked the surge to China’s push to diversify demand across regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, helping sustain export momentum despite trade friction with Washington. The figures have sharpened debate over global trade balances: Chinese commentary in some coverage blamed U.S. policies for limiting certain high-tech exports to China and contributing to the gap, while other reporting highlighted concerns that Chinese goods are increasingly reaching “much of the rest of the world” as companies seek customers elsewhere.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/xPZ6pYMqN5FKMV30SbejSudoQf3de3k_U8DIJlJc-qiovcV3aqeMOSqIUmV2Fv5aeyzGEzZcPy9_qK7cx-72EOgGCWJG5TwZWYFNBjj2DZlcWi-Aa1WNqWFbKCms1b5UoUq87JGoA1o2B3Nw4NKX2XNKHkV_3UvgeJwhMzVpoCW7rEIcU2r8F5GMdgntYaMMMnhp9sTc3A' alt='The production line at a car factory in Hangzhou, China, in October.
