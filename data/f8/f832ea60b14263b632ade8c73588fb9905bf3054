</ul><h1>Stay Cool</h1><p>Let me just get this out of the way right at the top. I’m a beer nerd.</p>
<p>Yes, I am the one you see, clogging up the craft beer aisle in the grocery store, lifting IPA 4-packs to check their canned-on dates. I might mumble to myself, “Oh, nice, strata hops,” as I check the Untappd score on my phone.</p>
<p>You say, “It’s an Oktoberfest,” and I ask, “Marzen or Festbier?” You say, “It’s a barleywine,” and I ask, “English style or American?”</p>
<p>Pastry stout, brett saison, rye-barrel-aged roggenbier–these are phrases I speak aloud without shame or irony.</p>
<p>But, I want to say: I use the phrase “beer nerd” instead of “beer snob” because I don’t like to yuck other people’s yum. If you have the palate of a high school freshman at the age of thirty-five, that’s fine! Enjoy your watery beer or hard seltzer that tastes like spray deodorant! I won’t judge (out loud)!</p>
<p>The only time I’m bothered by the bad taste of others is when I go to some backyard get-together and bring an array of curated brews, only to open the cooler and deposit them among cans upon cans of swill.</p>
<p>I know that those who would enjoy them won’t get them, and those who get them won’t appreciate them. And I can do nothing to stop this from happening.</p>
<p>Unless I get one of these things.</p>
<p>What we have here are some cool-looking, soft-sided coolers. One can hold about 36 cans, the other about 24. The 36-can bag can be worn as a backpack, whereas the 24-can option is a bit more of a basic cooler shape. It can, however, float. Yes, that’s right: a floating cooler. (Weirdly, this isn’t in its name, nor is it the first thing highlighted in the marketing material I read. C’mon, people! A floating cooler is COOL!)</p>
<p>With either of these, I can load up with exceptional beers and keep them from mingling with their lesser counterparts. Then, I get to control who gets the good stuff without worrying about the beers getting too warm.</p>
<p>Do I come across as a total asshole here? Absolutely!</p>
<p>But look, these coolers are neat. They look nice and will keep stuff cold. Plus, the smaller one FLOATS! How rad is that?</p>
<p>Buy a cooler, please.</p>
