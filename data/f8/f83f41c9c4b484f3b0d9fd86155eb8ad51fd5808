<p>In the latest push to end the Russia‑Ukraine war, President Trump has directed his special envoy Steve Witkoff to travel to Moscow next week to meet President Vladimir Putin, while US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll will hold parallel talks with Ukrainian officials following recent meetings in Kyiv and Abu Dhabi. The White House says a 28‑point US peace framework has been &quot;fine‑tuned&quot; after intensive consultations with Ukraine and that only a small number of disagreements remain, though it acknowledges several “delicate” issues are still unresolved. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has told allies that Kyiv is ready to move forward on the revised framework but wants to address sensitive points directly with President Trump and insists on protecting Ukraine’s core interests. European leaders, including France’s President Emmanuel Macron, remain doubtful that Russia is currently willing to accept a ceasefire or negotiate the more Ukraine‑friendly plan, and fresh Russian missile strikes underline that fighting continues even as diplomacy accelerates.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/qgzIxifmOcLB8EF7R3oRGsIb8zfmCtbDQIgX2iL-mGzA1xwnAqV-9dqXuz7yVNlc3lhgkr932AtJzPMbjDLZFR0jivoJYxtoIjHL4m9MMggr' alt='US special envoy Steve Witkoff speaks to reporters in Israel earlier in 2025; he is now heading to Moscow for Ukraine peace talks.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Plan’s Russian roots: Multiple reports say the original 28‑point US proposal borrowed heavily from a Russian‑authored paper outlining Moscow’s conditions for ending the war, shared with senior US officials in mid‑October after a Trump‑Zelensky meeting in Washington.</li><li>Miami drafting sessions: Sources say Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner sketched the initial plan over a series of private dinners in Miami with a Kremlin insider, and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio only learned the full scope of the draft once it leaked to the press.</li><li>Witkoff call controversy: Bloomberg‑reported transcripts indicate Witkoff advised top Putin aide Yuri Ushakov on how to present ideas about territorial control and suggested that Russian officials begin talks by praising Trump and using optimistic language, though Russian officials publicly dismissed the leak as &quot;fake&quot;.</li><li>Ukraine’s evolving stance: After initially criticizing the leaked plan as overly favorable to Russia, Ukrainian officials now say they reached an &quot;understanding&quot; with Washington in Geneva talks that adjusted the framework closer to Kyiv’s red lines, including on security guarantees and territorial questions.</li><li>Driscoll’s rising role: At 39, Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll—known in US media as Trump’s “drone guy”—has emerged as a central negotiator after leading talks with Ukrainians in Geneva and Kyiv and with Russian representatives in Abu Dhabi, reflecting his growing influence inside the administration.</li></ul><blockquote>The talks are going well and we remain optimistic. - Spokesman for US negotiator Dan Driscoll</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House: US officials say “tremendous progress” has been made on the peace framework, with only a few sensitive but manageable issues left to resolve before a potential agreement..
