<p>I recently joined Tony and Charles on the&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/two-teachers-talking/id523476748"><em>Two Teachers Talking</em></a>&nbsp;Podcast to talk about my winding road from engineer to lawyer to full-time Mac nerd. We dug into how I teach tech, the tools I love for helping others learn, and how technology can better serve teachers. It was a fun conversation, and I think you’ll enjoy it.</p>
