</p/><p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A bit of introspection and a #haiku.  In part a post to say I&rsquo;m still here.
</p>
        <p>I wonder, what makes one a poet?  And perhaps not the general case, but the
self-centered case.</p>
<p>Am I a poet?</p>
<p>I write poetry.  I am an adept conjurer of analogies and metaphors.  I have an
above average command of the English language.  I write poems, scratching out
words to find the best (in the moment) forms, sometimes returning to prior
phrases.</p>
<p>At our local library, next week we’re kicking off a Personal Curriculum series.
I had been considering poetry as mine—though ham radio just joined the
consideration.</p>
<p>My bedroom bookshelf is packed with poetry.  On occasion—though not often
enough—I find myself grabbing a book and reading a few poems.  Life pours from
these works, bathing me in warmth.</p>
<p>We were driving back home, and as we were passing a wooded area that chirps and
whistles in spring from the tree frogs.  At that moment, while driving in
silence, Jenny asked me what I was thinking about, I responded: frogs.</p>
<p>That spot along with the neighbors saying that a large bullfrog had come out of
hibernation earlier this month; when we had 55° Fahrenheit weather (and rain).</p>
<p>Which inspired the following haiku:</p>
<p class="verse">
Amidst icy woods<br />
New moon hiding snow and branch<br />
In the thaw, frog song.<br />
