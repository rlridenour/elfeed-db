Jeff Bradberry has an <a href="https://jeffbradberry.com/posts/2025/05/orgmode-timestamped-notes/">excellent post</a> on adding timestamped notes to the LOGBOOK drawer in Org files. Most of us are used to using this drawer to record state changes in  <b>TODO</b> notes. You can arrange to have the times of the state changes added to the LOGBOOK. You can also arrange to pop up a buffer so that you can add a note to the entry. I do this when the state changes to <b>CANCELLED</b> or <b>WAITING</b>. Sometimes you may want to add a note to a state change that doesn&rsquo;t normally have one.

That turns out to be easy. You simple add the universal argument to the state change call. If you use the normal <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> binding, you would simply use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>u</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> instead when you want to add a note.

Many of you probably already know all this but Bradberry thought it would nice to add arbitrary notes to the drawer as well. That turns out to be easy too. As usual, Emacs has us covered. You simply call <code>org-add-note</code> bound to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>z</kbd> by default.

This post is the seventh in a series on building an Org-mode Workflow. The whole series is worthwhile and you should definitely take a look if you&rsquo;re an Org user. There are links to the entire series in Bradberry&rsquo;s post.</p>
