    While I'm <i>intrigued</i> with the <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>… you know, where you work in discrete time segments, with equally discrete break intervals.  Perhaps making the work/relax cycle more specific and focused may convert these cycles into practice, and <i>condition</i> our brains.

    However, while I would like to focus my thoughts in discrete <i>bursts</i>, I don't want to interrupt the <i>flow</i>. You know, that <i>mental groove</i> where one is really productive. I certainly don't want a jarring <b>ding</b> to shatter that flow.

    I've decided to try an <i>experiment</i> to see if I can make the cycle changes noticeable, but not disturbing. The code is particular to my workflow, but perhaps you can convert it.
