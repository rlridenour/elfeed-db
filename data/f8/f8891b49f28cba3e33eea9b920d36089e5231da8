<p id="p2">Late last Tuesday night, after watching <a href="https://apple.co/3SVXtI7" rel="noopener noreferrer">F1: The Movie</a> at the Steve Jobs Theater, I was driving back from dropping Federico off at his hotel when I got a text:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3"><p>
  Can you pick me up?
</p></blockquote>
<p id="p4">It was from my son <a href="https://www.finnvoorhees.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finn</a>, who had spent the evening nearby and was stalking me in Find My. Of course, I swung by and picked him up, and we headed back to our hotel in Cupertino.</p>
<p id="p5">On the way, Finn filled me in on a new class in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple&rsquo;s Speech framework</a> called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/speechanalyzer" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpeechAnalyzer</a> and its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/speechtranscriber" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpeechTranscriber</a> module. Both the class and module are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/277" rel="noopener noreferrer">part of Apple&rsquo;s OS betas</a> that were released to developers last week at WWDC. My ears perked up immediately when he told me that he&rsquo;d tested SpeechAnalyzer and SpeechTranscriber and was impressed with how fast and accurate they were.</p>
<p id="p6">It&rsquo;s still early days for these technologies, but I&rsquo;m here to tell you that their speed alone is a game changer for anyone who uses voice transcription to create text from lectures, podcasts, YouTube videos, and more. That&rsquo;s something I do multiple times every week for <a href="https://appstories.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStories</a>, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPC</a>, and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/unwind/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unwind</a>, generating transcripts that I upload to YouTube because the site&rsquo;s built-in transcription isn&rsquo;t very good.</p>
<p id="p7">What&rsquo;s frustrated me with other tools is how slow they are. Most are built on <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/whisper-1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whisper</a>, OpenAI&rsquo;s open source speech-to-text model, which was released in 2022. It&rsquo;s cheap at under a penny per one million tokens, but isn&rsquo;t fast, which is frustrating when you&rsquo;re in the final steps of a YouTube workflow.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-06-16-at-19-27-30-2x-1750116481249.png" alt="An SRT file generated by Yap."><p class="image-caption">An SRT file generated by Yap.</p></div>
<p id="p9">I asked Finn what it would take to build a command line tool to transcribe video and audio files with SpeechAnalyzer and SpeechTranscriber. He figured it would only take about 10 minutes, and he wasn&rsquo;t far off. In the end, it took me longer to get around to installing macOS Tahoe after WWDC than it took Finn to build <a href="https://github.com/finnvoor/yap" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yap</a>, a simple command line utility that takes audio and video files as input and outputs SRT- and TXT-formatted transcripts.</p>
<p id="p10">Yesterday, I finally took the Tahoe plunge and immediately installed Yap. I grabbed the 7GB 4K video version of <a href="https://appstories.net/episodes/441" rel="noopener noreferrer">AppStories episode 441</a>, which is about 34 minutes long, and ran it through Yap. It took just 45 seconds to generate an SRT file. Here&rsquo;s Yap ripping through nearly 20% of an episode of NPC in 10 seconds:</p>
<div class="media-wrapper video-autoplay js-video-autoplay aligncenter" id="div11">
            <video data-autoplay="yes" width="1920" height="728" data-is-retina="yes" preload="auto" playsinline controls><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-project-1750161202101.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-project-1750161202101.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="https://cdn.macstories.net/untitled-project-1750161202101.ogv" type="video/ogg"></source></source></source></video><div class="caption"></div>
</div>
<p id="p12">Next, I ran the same file through <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ai-captions-for-videos-vidcap/id1620725834" rel="noopener noreferrer">VidCap</a> and <a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacWhisper</a>, using its V2 Large and V3 Turbo models. Here&rsquo;s how each app and model did:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper" id="div13"><table><thead><tr><th>App</th>
<th align="right">Transcripiton Time</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Yap</td>
<td align="right">0:45</td>
</tr><tr><td>MacWhisper (Large V3 Turbo)</td>
<td align="right">1:41</td>
</tr><tr><td>VidCap</td>
<td align="right">1:55</td>
</tr><tr><td>MacWhisper (Large V2)</td>
<td align="right">3:55</td>
</tr></tbody></table></div><p id="p14">All three transcription workflows had similar trouble with last names and words like &ldquo;AppStories,&rdquo; which LLMs tend to separate into two words instead of camel casing. That&rsquo;s easily fixed by running a set of find and replace rules, although I&rsquo;d love to feed those corrections back into the model itself for future transcriptions.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/cleanshot-2025-06-16-at-19-33-58-2x-1750116855428.png" alt="Once transcribed, a video can be used to generate additional formats like outlines."><p class="image-caption">Once transcribed, a video can be used to generate additional formats like outlines.</p></div>
<p id="p16">What stood out above all else was Yap&rsquo;s speed. By harnessing SpeechAnalyzer and SpeechTranscriber on-device, the command line tool tore through the 7GB video file a full 2.2&times; faster than MacWhisper&rsquo;s Large V3 Turbo model, with no noticeable difference in transcription quality.</p>
<p id="p17">At first blush, the difference between 0:45 and 1:41 may seem insignificant, and it arguably is, but those are the results for just one 34-minute video. Extrapolate that to running Yap against the hours of Apple Developer videos released on YouTube with the help of <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>yt-dlp</code></a>, and suddenly, you&rsquo;re talking about a significant amount of time. Like all automation, picking up a 2.2&times; speed gain one video or audio clip at a time, multiple times each week, adds up quickly.</p>
<p id="p18">Whether you&rsquo;re producing video for YouTube and need subtitles, generating transcripts to summarize lectures at school, or doing something else, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/277" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpeechAnalyzer and SpeechTranscriber</a> &ndash; available across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Vision Pro &ndash; mark a significant leap forward in transcription speed without compromising on quality. I fully expect this combination to replace Whisper as the default transcription model for transcription apps on Apple platforms.</p>
<p id="p19">To test Apple&rsquo;s new model, install the macOS Tahoe beta, which currently requires an Apple developer account, and then <a href="https://github.com/finnvoor/yap" rel="noopener noreferrer">install Yap from its GitHub page</a>.</p>
