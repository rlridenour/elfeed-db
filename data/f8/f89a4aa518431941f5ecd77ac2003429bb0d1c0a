<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting today, CarPlay Ultra, the next generation of CarPlay, is
available with new <a href="https://media.astonmartin.com/aston-martin-debuts-apple-carplay-ultra-for-iphone-users">Aston Martin</a> vehicle orders in the U.S.
and Canada, and will be available for existing models that feature
the brand’s next-generation infotainment system through a software
update in the coming weeks. CarPlay Ultra builds on the
capabilities of CarPlay and provides the ultimate in-car
experience by deeply integrating with the vehicle to deliver the
best of iPhone and the best of the car. It provides information
for all of the driver’s screens, including real-time content and
gauges in the instrument cluster, while reflecting the automaker’s
look and feel and offering drivers a customizable experience. Many
other automakers around the world are working to bring CarPlay
Ultra to drivers, including newly committed brands Hyundai, Kia,
and Genesis.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23156741/ios-16-carplay-apple-wwdc-hvac-deeper-integration">First announced at WWDC 2022</a>, simply as “the next generation of CarPlay”, it was originally set to ship “<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/29/next-generation-carplay-still-yet-to-launch/">before the end of 2024</a>”. So it’s a little late, but by the standards of the auto industry, not <em>too</em> late. It looks really good — Apple’s Newsroom article is replete with photos and videos showing it in action. It feels true to both Apple’s and Aston Martin’s brand identities — but I’d say more Apple-y than Aston Martin-y, simply because the typography is all San Francisco.</p>

<p>Apple successfully kept the name “CarPlay Ultra” secret until today. (Would have been funny, given <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/14/hbo-max-again">other news this week</a>, if they’d called it “CarPlay Max”.)</p>
