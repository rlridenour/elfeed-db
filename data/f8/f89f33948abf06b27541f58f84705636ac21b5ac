<p>The New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, began a new campaign
on Wednesday that he called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UUOD-sa5As&amp;feature=youtu.be">The Golden Age of Travel Starts With
You</a>,” complete with a 1960s-style public service
announcement that spliced together scenes of the country’s first
air travelers, dressed in suits and hats, with present-day clips
of in-flight brawls and airport meltdowns. In the background,
Frank Sinatra sings “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOzEeJZ92X8">Come Fly With Me.</a>”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the Department of Transportation website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Secretary Duffy posed a few key questions every flyer should ask
themselves this holiday season to help Americans reach their
destinations as quickly, efficiently and comfortably as possible:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing
their bags in the overhead bin?</li>
<li>Are you dressing with respect?</li>
<li>Are you keeping control of your children and helping them
through the airport?</li>
<li>Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?</li>
<li>Are you saying please and thank you in general?</li>
</ol>
