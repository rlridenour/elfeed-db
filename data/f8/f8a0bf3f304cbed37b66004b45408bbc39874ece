<p>A lecturer in the English Department at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas A &amp; M University</a> was fired from her position after a student in one of her courses complained that she was &#8220;not entirely sure [material on gender identity] is legal to be teaching&#8230; because according to our president, there&#8217;s only two genders&#8230; and also this very much goes against not only [mine] but a lot of people&#8217;s religious beliefs.&#8221;<span id="more-54942"></span></p>
<p>The student recorded her voicing of the complaint in class (see the video at the end of this post) and shared it, along with audio recordings of her conversation with Texas A &amp; M&#8217;s president, Mark A. Welsh III, with Texas State Representative Brian Harrison.</p>
<p>Initially President Welsh had told the student that firing the instructor was &#8220;<a href="https://x.com/brianeharrison/status/1965093859488399406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not happening</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrison, who describes himself on X/Twitter as a &#8220;believer in freedom,&#8221; shared the recordings widely on the social media platform on Monday along with a <a href="https://x.com/brianeharrison/status/1965093851531444722/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter he wrote to the governor of Texas</a>, Greg Abbott, in which he demands that he fire both the instructor and Welsh.</p>
<p>Later that day (on <a href="https://x.com/TAMU/status/1965252609033327010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a>) and then again yesterday (in a <a href="https://president.tamu.edu/messages/an-update-from-president-mark-a-welsh-iii.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> on the university website), Welsh announced he was firing the instructor.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Welsh said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>This afternoon, following full consideration of the facts related to this situation, I directed the Provost to terminate the professor involved, effective immediately. Please understand that these decisions were mine alone and were not made lightly. While I cannot provide all the details at this time, I will share the following facts.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>This summer, a children’s literature course contained content that did not align with any reasonable expectation of standard curriculum for the course. After this issue was raised, college and department leadership worked with students to offer alternative opportunities for students to complete the course, and made changes to ensure this course content does not continue in future semesters. At that time, I made it clear to our academic leadership that course content must match catalog descriptions for each and every one of our course sections.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>However, I learned late yesterday that despite that directive, the college continued to teach content that was inconsistent with the published course description for another course this fall. As a result, I took the above administrative actions, and deans and department heads will conduct an audit of course offerings to ensure they align with the course descriptions.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Our students use the published information in the course catalog to make important decisions about the courses they take in pursuit of their degrees. If we allow different course content to be taught from what is advertised, we break trust with our students. When it comes to our academic offerings, we must keep faith with our students and with the state of Texas.</em></p>
<p>Faculty! You must not depart from the official course descriptions! They are, as you know, comprehensive in scope, never subject to interpretation, and brook deviation only at the cost of your employment!</p>
<p>The lecturer who was fired, Melissa McCoul, was teaching English 360, &#8220;Children&#8217;s Literature.&#8221; Here is the official bulletin description of the course:</p>
<div id="attachment_54943" style="width: 906px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54943" class="size-full wp-image-54943" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/texas-a-m-childrens-literature-course-description.png" alt="Course Description of ENGLISH 360, Literature for Children:Credits 3. 3 Lecture Hours.

<p>In addition to firing McCoul, Welsh also removed the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Mark Zoran, and English Department Chair Emily Johnson from their administrative positions.</p>
<p>&#8220;These decisions were mine alone,&#8221; said Welsh, anticipatorily protesting too much against the complaint that he was selling out his faculty and abandoning any pretense of concern for academic freedom in order to please politicians.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;This isn’t about academic freedom; it’s about academic responsibility.&#8221; Which responsibility? The responsibility to not &#8220;allow different course content to be taught from what is advertised.&#8221; Again, please see the course description above. And why isn&#8217;t &#8220;this&#8221; about academic freedom?</p>
<p>Anyway, I think the lessons are quite clear:</p>
<p>Students &#8212; to avoid learning about ideas different from ones you were brought up with, please contact your local Republican government official.</p>
<p>Faculty &#8212; just one more reason to ban phones and laptops and the like from your classes.</p>
<p>Administrators &#8212; literally anything can be used as a pretext for violating faculty academic freedom.</p>
