<p>The United States announced sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, on October 22–23, citing Moscow’s &quot;lack of serious commitment&quot; to a peace process in Ukraine and marking the first time President Trump’s administration has hit major Russian energy firms directly [nytimes.com#3][pbs.org#1][cbsnews.com#1]. The move followed Mr. Trump’s decision to cancel a planned summit with President Vladimir Putin after talks produced no progress, and came as the European Union prepared a 19th package of penalties that includes new energy measures [newarab.com#1][theguardian.com#1]. Markets reacted quickly: global oil prices rose several percentage points as traders assessed supply risks, and major buyers such as Indian refiners and Reliance began reviewing or planning to reduce Russian crude purchases [nytimes.com#2][ft.com#2][semafor.com#1].</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/FXVCkgNdue8VK3dViwQYGXLoXclH20vAPjkZp_ZoWSScMNoKRllG4GYU354EUEn6kX6wsAoXNYtxY7vchZE5giTp6ekI93OqQDB08K2mtZZEIFvc6gAVRhlyzJ9N2aRxOorFcmMOzIV3QZxKcyDIJwqm27OfhZw512Ahdge2-GVsrdD6u5ssA9KzvSHh2mr2j6YHqREQt3P_Lh8a_ENrahG8GirMPwY-pJ7bjf-z6sp0heW8Nr4oPHvuTqYWtVTweaKRJRToAUPXjmIkrg' alt='File photo: a Rosneft-flagged crude oil tanker transits the Bosphorus in 2023, illustrating the global reach of Russia’s energy exports' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Market reaction: Oil benchmarks jumped in the hours after the sanctions were announced, with traders pricing in tighter supplies and a 3–5% immediate rally in crude markets [nytimes.com#2][semafor.com#1].</li><li>India&#x27;s response: India’s largest buyers, including Reliance, said they would scrutinize or reduce direct purchases tied to Rosneft and Lukoil, prompting refiners to check shipping documents for shipments arriving after November 21 [ft.com#2][rt.com#2].</li><li>Russian official reaction: Kremlin spokespeople dismissed the measures as manageable while senior Russian figures like Dmitry Medvedev framed the move as hostile, calling it effectively an act of war on social media [politico.eu#1][rt.com#7].</li><li>EU parallel measures: The European Union advanced its 19th sanctions package the following day, which includes a ban on Russian LNG imports and a new blacklist of shadow-fleet tankers used to evade price caps [theguardian.com#1][apnews.com#2].</li></ul><blockquote>Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don&#x27;t go anywhere - President Donald Trump</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>United States (Treasury): Treasury officials said the sanctions target major oil companies because Russia has shown a lack of serious commitment to ending the war in Ukraine and to cut revenues that fund Moscow&#x27;s military effort.
