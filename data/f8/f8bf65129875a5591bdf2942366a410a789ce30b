I&rsquo;ve made the switch to w3m from eww, which has been great overall since the eww thread-blocking was insufferable. However, one of the biggest benefits of eww was the ability to engage a readability mode that cut all but the content of the page, which is also a feature I use a lot on Firefox on my phone. A previous answer from 20201 did something like this but was referencing elfeed, which has nothing to do with my use case, and used a bootstrap Python script.
