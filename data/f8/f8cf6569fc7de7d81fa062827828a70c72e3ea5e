<li>Can connect via bluetooth, or you can use the 2.4GHz dongle</li>
<li>Or, you can connect both at the same time to pair with two devices at once</li>
<li>Very good sound quality, apparently</li>
<li>Using the dongle is ideal for low-latency response during gaming</li>
<li>These aren’t <em>just</em> for gaming, though</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but you can play them while you play <em>Margaritaville 2: Quest for the Lost Shaker of Salt</em></li>
</ul><h1>Hear Hear</h1><p>Ah, yes! Gaming earbuds! That familiar product category!</p>
<p>What makes them particularly adept for gaming? Well… uhhh… you see…</p>
<p>Look, it’s obvious to us, a bunch of total gamers, so it would be difficult to explain to newbs like all of you. That’s why we’re struggling here. So, we’re turning to our close, personal friend, Amazon reviewer Charlie Liu, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZSQ3JI1XFHNT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?tag=mehdown-20">for a straightforward explanation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a gamer and audiophile, I’m constantly looking for “better” audio gear to give myself options. I have been on the hunt for wireless earbuds that aren’t Bluetooth as BT has too many downsides when it comes to gaming. For example, BT uses a very low quality codec if you require in-game chat, or that the delay/latency between audio and video is so big that you often miss the important sound cues in game. That was when I stumbled onto these IAMJOY earbuds that uses the 2.4Ghz wireless band instead of BT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! Charlie! That’s <em>exactly</em> what we were about to say! Ugh, bluetooth, amirite? Thank god these aren’t Bluetooth earbuds at all, huh?</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s see what else Charlie has to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These earbuds are capable of pairing with my phone via bluetooth while paired to my gaming computer at the same time. The benefit is that I don’t have to take off my earbuds to switch the audio source as phone calls come through while I’m still gaming. I can then adjust the volume on either the phone or on the computer to balance and keep chatting while I’m still gaming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Um, yeah, right. Okay, so they <em>are</em> bluetooth. Before, when we said, “Thank god these aren’t Bluetooth earbuds at all,” what we meant was, “Thank god these aren’t <em>only</em> Bluetooth earbuds,” and then… uhh… Grammarly changed it on us. Yeah, that’s definitely what happened.</p>
<p>But, anyway, how do they sound? According to Charlie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These earbuds specifically are tuned towards deep booms while still offering great mids and highs, which is pretty unusual at this price range or even for wireless earbuds in general. But what’s even more impressive is the sound stage. As a gamer, it’s important for me to be able to hear the direction of sounds so that I know where my enemies are. With the soundstage that these earbuds offers, I can clearly tell who/what/where within the FPS games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We couldn’t agree more. Hearing the direction is so important when you’re playing a classic Feudal Positioning Strategy game.</p>
<p>Okay, so, the point we’re really trying to make here? It’s simple. These earbuds get shockingly high reviews over on Amazon, considering that they are, as Charlie alluded to, fairly cheap over there. And by “fairly cheap,” we mean: more than twice as much as our price.</p>
<p>And all those features that make them great for gaming? Like high-quality sound and a surprisingly good microphone (which is something else Charlie highlighted elsewhere)? They also make them great for doing any other earbud-related activity, like listening to podcasts while you do dishes or talking on the phone.</p>
<p>Which means: you don’t have to game to get these gaming earbuds. But if you do game, you’re going to love that 2.4Ghz wireless band. We know we do. And trust us: we’re all total hardcore gamers here. You can count on that.</p>
