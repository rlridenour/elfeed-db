Lynn Leichtle over at <a href="https://lynn.sh">Lynn</a> has an interesting post on <a href="https://lynn.sh/guix-emacs-file-manager.html">using Emacs as a Guix file manager</a>. Almost all of my work these days takes place in the Apple milieu so, of course, I&rsquo;m not a Guix user and can&rsquo;t speak with even pretend authority about it. Still, Lynn&rsquo;s post is easy enough to understand. She does most of her work in Emacs and finds that she has no need for a file manager. Emacs handles all that for her. But occasionally, for reasons you can read about at her post, she wants to click on a directory and have it open in Emacs dired.

It turns out that Guix can do this for you fairly easily. See her post for the details if you have a similar need.

Lynn&rsquo;s post made me realize that I have actually embraced the old joke about Emacs being an OS. <i>Of course</i> I don&rsquo;t need a file manager; that&rsquo;s what Dired is for. And if I open a directory in Emacs, I&rsquo;m popped right into a Dired buffer for that directory.

Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t really need anything like Guix either. I hardly ever load third party packages—other than Emacs, of course—and when I do I usually get them from the app store, or <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> both of which take care of all the things Guix would do. When I <i>do</i> need a third party application, it&rsquo;s almost always an Emacs package and, of course, Emacs handles all that pretty much seamlessly.
</p>
<p>
Given all that, it&rsquo;s hard to avoid the conclusion that Emacs really has become my OS. Basically, everything I do, I do from within Emacs. You could call that obsessive but <i>I</i> call it simplifying my life.</p>
