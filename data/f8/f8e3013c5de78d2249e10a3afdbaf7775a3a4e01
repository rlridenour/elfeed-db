<h2 id="the-major-changes">The Major Changes</h2>
<p>Two major changes happened over 2024. The introduction of the <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander" target="_blank">ZSA Moonlander Next-gen Ergonomics zsa.io</a> to the hardware stack, and the other was <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">GNU Emacs - GNU Project</a>.</p>
<h3 id="zsa-moonlander">ZSA Moonlander</h3>
<p>I had been using the Planck from ZSA. It is a great keyboard but I wanted to try out a split keyboard and had been drooling over the Moonlander for a while. I acquired it in July.</p>
<p>Took me a few weeks to get comfortable in it. Having used the Planck for about two years, I am used to the ortholinear setup. The Moonlander has so many extra keys, that it took some getting used to. Of course, that process was also accompanied by a ton of tweaks to the keyboard. The Moonlander is completely programmable through <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/home" target="_blank">Oryx The ZSA Keyboard Configurator</a>.</p>
<p>Programmable means choices. I had to answer basic questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do I put the space bar?</li>
<li>What about the modifier keys? Do I need a right ⌘ key? Or a right ⌃ key?</li>
</ul>
<p>Choices which had to be tried out for a while before I could make an informed one. Took a while and it is still an ongoing process.</p>
<p>I love the keyboard. Just absolutely love it. It has made my pain in my fingers and wrists go away. I am usually on the keyboard for more than 14 hours a day. Yeah, I know, I need a life. This is the best investment I have made on my health in a long while. Feels fantastic.</p>
<p>Things which make this keyboard perfect:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Shift key required. Auto-shift is a god-send. A little longer press on a key and it types the character with the shift key held down. The downside? I can’t use any other keyboard. Using the keyboard on the Air, I find myself holding on to a key expecting the Auto-shift behavior and nothing happens. Deeply frustrating.</li>
<li>The ability to get the extra keys to do the usual things which I do on a regular basis is a killer feature. One key for <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/" target="_blank">Alfred - Productivity App for macOS</a>. One key for <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/" target="_blank">Keyboard Maestro 11.0.3 Work Faster with Macros for macOS</a>.</li>
<li>The Hyper key and the Meh key.</li>
<li>For the Emacs user, multiple Esc keys, and a dedicated <code>C-g</code> key.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in improving your input device, I would recommend the Moonlander with glowing praise.</p>

<h3 id="emacs">Emacs</h3>
<p>If you follow my blog, you know this story. I am all-in on Emacs at this stage. I wish I had made this move earlier on in life. But I am making up. Took a deep-dive into it for it to stick.</p>
<p>I will tell you a story.</p>
<p>I had just posted the article <a href="https://bicycleforyourmind.com/part_five_of_my_battles_with_emacs">Part Five of My Battles with Emacs - Bicycle For Your Mind</a> when I got email from someone I did not know. He recommended the <a href="https://github.com/mclear-tools/consult-notes" target="_blank">Consult-notes</a> package and gave me a bit of code:</p>
<pre><code>#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun lookup-word-at-point ()
  "Lookup word at point in OSX Dictionary"
  (interactive)
  (call-process-shell-command (format "open dict:///%s/" (word-at-point))))
#+end_src</code></pre>
<p>Out of the blue, one of the OG’s of the Emacs world, Mr.&nbsp;Howard Melman sent me email. Encouraging me and giving me advice. How cool is that? I was floored. There are a whole bunch of people who are Emacs-gurus and they help unknown newbies get comfortable with Emacs. I am so thankful to these folks. They make the journey rewarding. Thank you Mr.&nbsp;Melman.</p>
<p>Thank you <a href="https://protesilaos.com/" target="_blank">Mr.&nbsp;Protesilaos Stavrou</a>.<br>
Thank you <a href="https://systemcrafters.net/" target="_blank">Mr.&nbsp;David Wilson</a>.<br>
Thank you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49kBWM3RQQ8&amp;list=PL9KxKa8NpFxIcNQa9js7dQQIHc81b0-Xg" target="_blank">Mr.&nbsp;Mike Zamansky</a>.<br>
Thank you <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/" target="_blank">Ms.&nbsp;Sasha Chua</a>.<br>
Thank you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@koenighaunstetten" target="_blank">Mr.&nbsp;Rainer Konig</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you all for teaching me stuff.</p>
<p>This list can be a lot longer. In fact, I will make this a recurring part of the Much Ado About Emacs series. There are a lot of people to thank.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am enjoying my time in Emacs. Learning new things, trying out new things. Loving the act of writing. An unexpected by-product? Emacs makes me write more. The environment is created by me (with a lot of help from other folks). There is no friction. It is perfectly designed for me and my writing. I love it here.</p>
