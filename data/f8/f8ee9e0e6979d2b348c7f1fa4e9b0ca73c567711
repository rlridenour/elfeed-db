 
          <p>A late happy new year to everyone! I almost forgot to publish last month&rsquo;s favourite (blog) posts, and since last month was the last one of 2025, let&rsquo;s do a short recap as well. Previous month&rsquo;s recap: <a href="/post/2025/12/november-2025">November 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Last year was another eventful year. Browse the full <a href="/post/2025/">2025 Brain Baking archive</a> for more juicy details. I selected one post per month that for me stands out:</p>
<ul>
<li>In January, I had the idea to <a href="/post/2025/01/you-should-compile-your-own-philosophy/">compile your own philosophy</a>. So far, I have collected lots of notes and summarised too many previous ones, but nothing has been published yet.</li>
<li>In February, I shared <a href="/post/2025/02/my-stationary-drawers/">my stationary drawers</a>. I should really clean out all those fountain pens.</li>
<li>In March, I dug up a photo of <a href="/post/2025/03/my-first-console/">my first console</a>, the SEGA Genesis/MegaDrive.</li>
<li>In April, I learned that <a href="/post/2025/04/my-sourdough-starter-has-twins/">my sourdough starter has twins</a> somewhere in Switzerland.</li>
<li>In May, more <a href="/post/2025/05/writing-is-taking-a-stab-at-immortality/">thoughts about writing and publishing</a> popped up.</li>
<li>In June, I debunked (or confirmed?) the fact that <a href="/post/2025/06/do-freelance-consultants-earn-more-than-their-employee-counterparts/">IT freelancers earn more than their employee counterparts</a>.</li>
<li>In July, I got influenced by other board game enthusiasts and admitted to <a href="/post/2025/07/too-many-games-too-little-time/">having too many games and too little time</a>.</li>
<li>In August, we welcomed our second little one and I <a href="/post/2025/08/forty/">turned forty</a>&mdash;in that order. Yes, that is important to me.</li>
<li>In September, I wrote too many articles about <a href="/post/2025/09/the-flemish-trick-taking-tradition/">trick taking games and local traditions</a>.</li>
<li>In October, I fondly looked back at years of <a href="/post/2025/10/i-owe-warez-for-properly-discovering-crpgs/">downloading warez software</a>.</li>
<li>In November, I recovered my late father-in-law&rsquo;s <a href="/post/2025/11/the-1994-ibm-pc-invoice/">1994 IBM PC invoice</a>.</li>
<li>In December, I started <a href="/post/2025/12/properly-preparing-tea-while-shaving-a-yak/">shaving Emacs yaks</a>. I haven&rsquo;t stopped ever since.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our son also kicked me out of my cosy home office upstairs. Luckily, our renovations were finished in time, so we moved the living room and I <a href="/post/2025/10/my-desk-setup-in-2025/">took the old space hostage</a>. One of the advantages of directly staring at a larger window is being able to admire the seasonal view:</p>

<p>For 2026, I only wish for one thing: <em>stability</em>. Let&rsquo;s stop the craziness and try to get things settled down. No more kids, renovations, job changes, broken bicycles, and serious sickness please. Just, you know, breathing. <em>Whoosah</em>.</p>
<h2 id="selected-blog-posts">Selected (blog) posts</h2>
<p>Last month I joined the Advent of Code challenge using Clojure, a language I know absolutely nothing about. Since then I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with Lisp-based dialects. Forgive me if most of the links below are programming-oriented: it&rsquo;s been invigorating to learn something new and actually enjoy a programming language for a chance. It&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m typing this in Emacs now, although I haven&rsquo;t even installed CIDER yet. All in due time&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nick George reports on <a href="https://nickgeorge.net/programming/custom-static-clojure-websites-an-update/">building static websites with Clojure</a>.</li>
<li>Nathan Marz describes how <a href="http://nathanmarz.com/blog/clojures-missing-piece.html">he invented Specter</a> to fill Clojure&rsquo;s mutability hole. I don&rsquo;t understand 90% of the technicalities there, but one day, I will.</li>
<li>More Clojure stuff. Sorry&hellip; Mikko Koski helped me get started: <a href="https://www.mikkokoski.com/blog/8-tips-for-advent-of-code-2022/index.html">8 tips for Advent of Code 2022</a> in Clojure.</li>
<li>A more official one, but just as interesting: the <a href="https://clojure.org/news/2024/12/02/state-of-clojure-2024">State of Clojure 2024 results</a>. 76% of the people using it build web apps, 40% is on Emacs/CIDER, and Babashka is super popular!</li>
<li>This <a href="https://solhsa.com/aoc/">Advent of Code GIF archive</a> is crazy.</li>
<li>Victor Dorneanu wrote about his <a href="https://blog.dornea.nu/2024/02/22/from-doom-to-vanilla-emacs/">Doom Emacs to Vanilla</a> migration. I tried Doom/Spacemacs for about one whole day and then started back from scratch, but damn, it&rsquo;s <em>very</em> challenging, even though you can &ldquo;do what you want&rdquo;&mdash;if you&rsquo;re an Emacs/Elisp acolyte, that is. I&rsquo;m planning to get babtized in the Emacs Church very soon.</li>
<li>Alice from The Wallflower Digest shares her thoughts about <a href="https://thewallflowerdigest.co.uk/life/blog/personal-curriculums/">personal curriculums</a>; a way to get started with <em>deliberate</em> life-long learning. (via <a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/">Joel</a>, I think?)</li>
<li>Karthinks found <a href="https://karthinks.com/software/fifteen-ways-to-use-embark/">fifteen ways to use Embark</a>, a wonderful context-aware Emacs package.</li>
<li>More &ldquo;Emacs from scratch&rdquo; blogs to share: this one&rsquo;s <a href="https://arne.me/blog/emacs-from-scratch-part-one-foundations">from Arne</a> and lies out the foundations in case you want to get started. Thanks, Arne. You&rsquo;re in my RSS feed now.</li>
<li>Frank Meeuwsen writes (in Dutch) <a href="https://blog.frankmeeuwsen.com/2025/12/24/hoe-aitools-de-derde-golf.html">about AI tooling</a> and how they democratise digital literacy. Or rather, how they <em>should</em>.</li>
<li>Gregory J. Stein wrote a guide on <a href="https://cachestocaches.com/2017/3/complete-guide-email-emacs-using-mu-and/">email in Emacs using Mu and Mu4e</a>. I have more thoughts on that saved for a separate blog post.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;d like to know how many Emacs packages you&rsquo;re currently rocking, Manuel Uberti <a href="https://manueluberti.eu/posts/2021-09-01-package-report/">has an Elisp <code>defun</code> for you</a> (via <a href="https://site.sebasmonia.com/">Sebastián</a>)</li>
<li>Kristoffer Balintona helped me better understand the <a href="https://kristofferbalintona.me/posts/202202211546/">Vertico completion-at-point-function stack</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok that was definitely too much Emacs stuff. The lack of other links shows how much I&rsquo;ve been obsessed with the editor lately. No <em>other random links</em> for this month!</p>
