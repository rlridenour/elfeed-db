God of Grace and Wholeness, <br></br></p>

 <p>
All around us, we see pain and heartache, <br></br>
the effects of fragmented and broken systems, <br></br>
communities, and families. <br></br>
When the pain of others becomes <br></br>
too much for us to bear, <br></br>
we respond by building up walls <br></br>
that separate us from the world.
</p>

 <p>
So here we stay, <br></br>
safe and secure <br></br>
behind our walls of division, <br></br>
seeing only ourselves, <br></br>
our own problems, <br></br>
and our own hopes.
</p>

 <p>
We boast of our love for humanity, <br></br>
while at the same time, <br></br>
fail to see the needs of our neighbor.
</p>

 <p>
But God, You have called us to be your people, <br></br>
and you have have given us a new commandment, <br></br>
the commandment to love one another. <br></br>
Loving others, though, is something that we cannot do <br></br>
from a position of safety and security, <br></br>
for to love is embrace vulnerability and risk, <br></br>
all for the sake of the beloved. <br></br></p>

 <p>
So, guide our hands to reach out across our walls <br></br>
and open our eyes to see beyond ourselves, <br></br>
so that we might be used by you <br></br>
for the healing of this world. <br></br> <br></br>
In the name of Jesus Christ, <br></br>
who called us to be in the world, <br></br>
but not of it, <br></br>
we pray. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
