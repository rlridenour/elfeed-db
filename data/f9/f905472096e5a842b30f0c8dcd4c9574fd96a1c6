Over at the Emacs subreddit, ValuableBuffalo is looking for a way of taking what he describes as &ldquo;fleeting notes&rdquo; on his iPhone and capturing them to an Org file in his Git repository. As soon as I saw that, I immediately thought of Álvaro Ramírez&rsquo;s <a href="https://xenodium.com/journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only">Journelly</a>. It&rsquo;s an app that Ramírez describes as &ldquo;like tweeting but for your eyes only&rdquo;.

Irreal readers know that I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Journelly <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?s=journelly">and have written about it extensively</a>. My use case is similar to what ValuableBuffalo is looking for: I use Journelly as a memo book so I capture random notes during the day and they are automatically exported to all my Apple devices. My typical is invocation is to bring up Journelly, press the dictation button, record my entry, and save it. Journelly captures the time and my location automatically so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that.

Ramírez himself answered ValuableBuffalo and pointed him to <a href="https://workingcopy.app/">working copy</a> to help with the Git interface. I&rsquo;m happy to have my entries collected in a single Org file on my laptop so I don&rsquo;t bother with collecting them into Git directly. I suppose I could capture the journelly.org file to Git but I haven&rsquo;t yet bothered.

Another user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1nx45p3/comment/nhmf6ao/">JDRiverRun</a>, mentions using the Apple Notes app for capturing the notes. That&rsquo;s what I used to do but Journelly automatically adds a date/time stamp and records my location when taking the note. Journelly really is much better for this type of application than Notes.

If you have a need similar to ValuableBuffalo&rsquo;s, take a look at Journelly. You&rsquo;ll probably find that it&rsquo;s a good fit for your needs.</p>
