<p>From a 2023 report at The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sony highly confidential information about its PlayStation
business has just been revealed by mistake. As part of the FTC v.
Microsoft hearing, Sony supplied a document from PlayStation chief
Jim Ryan that includes redacted details on the margins Sony shares
with publishers, its <em>Call of Duty</em> revenues, and even the cost of
developing some of its games.</p>

<p>It looks like someone redacted the documents with a black Sharpie — but when you scan them in, it’s easy to see some of the
redactions. Oops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is sort of the exception that proves the rule <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/23/trump-doj-pdf-redactions">regarding redactions</a>. If you redact a document digitally, you have to know what to look for (e.g. metadata) to be certain you’ve redacted everything you want to redact. If you redact a document on paper, you can just look at it, with good light and sharp eyes.</p>
