<p>In the latest betas out of Apple, we&#8217;re beginning to see hooks in place for future implementation of model context protocol (MCP) on the Apple platforms. MCP is a protocol originally engineered by Anthropic, making it easy to connect your LLM of choice to your favorite software of choice.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m currently experimenting with MCP connections between Claude and Notion and OmniFocus. It has really been transformative for my use of artificial intelligence to do what I like to lovingly call “donkey work”.</p>



<p>For example, I had it set up a database for me in Notion with a list of all the recent Apple events and then go find YouTube links for the individual event to add to a field in the database. This is work I could have done myself but desperately wanted to avoid. Having the robot do it in the background is exactly the kind of use of AI that gets my blessing.</p>



<p>Bringing this back to Apple, MCP connections between Apple&#8217;s productivity apps and a more powerful LLM could become quite useful if implemented in a way that users can trust. This also indicates Apple is more willing to go outside of its own sandbox to give users AI assistance on their platforms. If done with intentionality by Apple, I would love to see this become a reality.</p>
