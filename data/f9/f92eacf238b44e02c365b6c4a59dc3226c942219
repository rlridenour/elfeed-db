<p>Howard Oakley notes <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2025/05/15/check-your-network-backups-and-shares-as-afp-is-being-removed/">the deprecation of the Apple Filing Protocol</a>, which used to be the foundation of peer-to-peer file sharing on the Mac. (These days most Macs share files using the SMB protocol.) The end of AFP has some serious ramifications for some older Apple hardware:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In case you missed it, Apple has just announced that a “future version of macOS” will no longer support AFP, Apple Filing Protocol. This is included in the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121011">Enterprise release notes</a> for macOS 15.5 Sequoia….</p>
<p>  Greatest problems come with Apple’s old Time Capsules, most of which are still used with AFP, as they can only support SMB version 1, not versions 2 or 3. If you’re still using a Time Capsule, or an old NAS that doesn’t support SMB version 3, then access to your network storage may well still be reliant on AFP.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Oakley’s recommendation is also mine: If you’re using a Time Capsule or another old NAS that doesn’t use SMB 3, it’s finally time to say goodbye. If you recently put in a new drive, move it to a new NAS. And buy a new wi-fi access point. So it goes.</p>
