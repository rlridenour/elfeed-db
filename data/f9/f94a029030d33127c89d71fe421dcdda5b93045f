OpenAI appears to be gearing up to introduce ads in ChatGPT, presumably for users who don't pay to access the chatbot.<br/>

Engineer Tibor Blaho recently found references to upcoming ad functionality in the ChatGPT Android app. Code strings mention search ads, a search ad carousel, and an ad API. Though ad mentions were found in the Android app, it's likely a change that's coming to ChatGPT on all platforms, including iOS, Mac, and the desktop.<br/>

Given the "search" wording, it's possible ads will be limited to web searches and shopping research requests.<br/>

Access to ChatGPT starts at &#36;20 per month for the Plus plan, with a ChatGPT Pro plan available for &#36;200 per month with higher access limits. There are also business and education plans, along with the current free plan. In other countries, OpenAI offers a cheaper "Go" plan that could also expand to the United States when ads roll out.<br/>

There <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/27/openai-might-raise-the-price-of-chatgpt-to-22-by-2025-44-by-2029/">have been rumors</a> that OpenAI plans to gradually raise the price of ChatGPT access, and a plan restructuring with an ad-supported tier seems like the ideal time to make pricing changes.<br/>

As noted by <em><a href="https://searchengineland.com/chatgpt-ads-android-code-user-reports-first-ad-465517">Search Engine Land</a></em>, OpenAI executives have been changing their messaging around ads over the course of the last 12 months. In late 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said ads were a "last resort," but in early 2025, leaked internal forecasts included &#36;1 billion in "free user monetization" revenue in 2026. <a href="https://searchengineland.com/sam-altman-chatgpt-ads-pivot-463150">Earlier this year</a>, Altman said that he loved Instagram ads and felt they were valuable. He said he thought OpenAI could find "some cool product ad" that's a "net win to the user."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/01/chatgpt-ads-free-users/">ChatGPT is Going to Start Showing You Ads</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chatgpt-is-going-to-start-showing-you-ads.2473603/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
