<p>The fifth of five rules in Matthew Butterick’s “Typography in Ten Minutes”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And finally, font choice. The fastest, easiest, and most visible
improvement you can make to your typography is to ignore the fonts
already loaded on your computer (known as <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/system-fonts.html">system fonts</a>)
and the <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/free-fonts.html">free fonts</a> that inundate the internet. Instead,
buy a professional font (like those found in <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/font-recommendations.html">font
recommendations</a>). A professional font gives you the benefit
of a professional designer’s skills without having to hire one.</p>

<p>If that’s impossible, you can still make good typography with
system fonts. But choose wisely. And never choose <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/times-new-roman-alternatives.html">Times New
Roman</a> or <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/helvetica-and-arial-alternatives.html">Arial</a>, as those fonts are favored only by
the apathetic and sloppy. Not by typographers. Not by you.</p>
