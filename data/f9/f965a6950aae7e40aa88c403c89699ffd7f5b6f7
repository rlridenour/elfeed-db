<p>Last April, Mohsen Mahdawi, then a philosophy major at Columbia University, was attending a US citizenship application interview in Vermont when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wearing hoods and masks <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/04/15/philosophy-major-snatched-by-ice-during-citizenship-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took him from the building</a>, put him into an unmarked car, and drove off.<span id="more-55139"></span></p>

<p>The government appealed that decision, though, and today Mahdawi is back in court with, as one source puts it, the possibility of &#8220;the fearful outcome that he will be reimprisoned and then deported.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <em><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/29/metro/mohsen-mahdawi-gun-shop-visit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston Globe</a> </em>reports:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The appeal largely centers on whether the Vermont judge had jurisdiction to intervene in an immigration case. But in its court filings, the government also points to Mahdawi’s 2015 visit to the Vermont gun shop to argue he is a violent antisemite who poses a risk to the public.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Globe </em>delves into conflicting reports over whether Mahdawi at the time said things to a gun shop owner and a volunteer at a museum about his having killed Jews or him liking killing Jews.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Mahdawi has vigorously disputed [those allegations] in a sworn statement, and one of his attorneys, Luna Droubi, dismissed them at an April court hearing as “cartoonishly racist hearsay.” US District Judge Geoffrey Crawford reached a similar conclusion, suggesting locals may have “fabricated” their stories. Close friends can’t square the allegations with what they describe as a decadelong commitment to peaceful advocacy.</em></p>
<p>Yesterday, a vigil was held in support of Mahdawi at which members of the <a href="https://philosophy.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Columbia Department of Philosophy</a> spoke, and at which was read a statement issued by the department:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>A few months ago, members of the Department of Philosophy at Columbia University publicly expressed their horror and dismay when one of their students, Mohsen Mahdawi, was detained in Vermont by agents of the Department of Homeland Security. The Philosophy Department repeats its dismay once more today on learning of the potential reversal of the court judgment that granted Mahdawi his release. We continue to convey our sympathy and support to Mohsen, to his family, and to his friends. We continue to call upon the Provost and Acting President of Columbia University to state their willingness to assist, through the provision of material and legal resources, any students of the University targeted or detained seemingly only for having exercised their right to the free and peaceful expression of political opinion.</em></p>
<p>The current case is expected to be lengthy.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/09/30/columbia-philosophy-major-again-faces-deportation-threat/">Columbia Philosophy Major Again Faces Deportation Threat</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dailynous.com">Daily Nous</a>.</p>
