<p id="p2">Nintendo fans in Japan have had a &ldquo;My Nintendo&rdquo; storefront app for everything Nintendo for five years. Now, it&rsquo;s finally here for the rest of us, rechristened <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Store</a> for iOS and iPadOS. With the release of the Switch 2, the Nintendo eShop&rsquo;s performance is much better than before, but it&rsquo;s still not a great experience to navigate, which is why I was so excited to dive into the new app.</p>

<p id="p4">If you&rsquo;ve ever <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/" rel="noopener noreferrer">shopped on Nintendo&rsquo;s website</a>, the new app will look familiar. The home tab is a mix of featured games, consoles, and accessories, a best sellers list, sales, and other collections. The app also includes tabs for:</p>
<ul id="ul5"><li>Search, which pre-populated lists for hardware, franchise merch, games, and more;</li>
<li>News, which features upcoming games and other announcements;</li>
<li>Wish List where products you&rsquo;ve marked as favorites show up; and</li>
<li>Your Profile, where you can check your Play Activity by game title.</li>

<p id="p7">When you&rsquo;re ready to purchase something, the transaction happens in a Safari view controller rather than as an in-app purchase, and the process is smooth, especially if you already have a Nintendo account. The app also has extensive notification settings for everything from game releases and sales to check-in events and app updates, which can be individually turned on or off.</p>
<hr id="hr8"><p id="p9">There&rsquo;s nothing in the Nintendo Store app that you can&rsquo;t find elsewhere on the web or eShop on the Switch. However, the experience of having it all available in a single app that you can use when you might not have your Switch nearby or want to navigate Nintendo&rsquo;s website is a convenience I&rsquo;m glad is now available.</p>
<p id="p10">The Nintendo Store app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available as a free download on the App Store</a> for the iPhone and iPad. The Nintendo Store app is available on Android, too.</p>
