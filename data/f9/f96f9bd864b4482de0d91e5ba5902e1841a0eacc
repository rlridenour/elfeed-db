Xiaomi has filed a trademark for a second-generation custom chip called the "XRING 02," signaling that the company is proceeding with its in-house silicon roadmap mirroring Apple's transition to its own custom chips.<br/>

Xiaomi's new filing, first <a href="https://wccftech.com/xiaomi-has-filed-xring-02-trademark/">reported by <em>Wccftech</em></a> and verified via China's TianYanCha trademark database, suggests that development of the XRING 02 system-on-a-chip (SoC) is now underway. The move follows the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/xiaomi-announces-custom-chip/">company's announcement</a> earlier this year of the XRING O1, its first custom processor built with a 3-nanometer process, which debuted in the Xiaomi Tablet 7 Ultra. <br/>
<br/>
Xiaomi openly said that it had looked to Apple as a benchmark for its hardware ambitions and vertical integration across its ecosystem. The company said it had asked itself:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>We also want to become one of the top chipmakers, with our phones targeting iPhones, can our chips also be compared against those of Apple's?</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The new XRING 02 trademark is one of several filings made by the company in recent weeks. Others include the XRING T1 and XRING 0. Xiaomi likely seeks to build a family of custom processors for use across device categories, similar to Apple's use of the A-series, M-series, and S-series chips in iPhones, Macs, and Apple Watches.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xiaomi/">Xiaomi</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/25/xiaomi-trademarks-indicate-plan/">Xiaomi Trademarks Indicate Plan to Build Apple Silicon-Like Family of Custom Chips</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/xiaomi-trademarks-indicate-plan-to-build-apple-silicon-like-family-of-custom-chips.2459658/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
