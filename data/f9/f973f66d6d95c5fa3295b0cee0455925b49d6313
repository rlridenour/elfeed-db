Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup will include four iPhones, and two of those are going to get all-new display sizes. There's the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, which we've heard about several times, but the standard &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; is also going to have a different display size.<br/>
<br/>

We've heard a bit about the updated size before, but with most rumors focusing on the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;, it's easy to forget. Display analyst Ross Young today <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1928146088097349832">reiterated the screen sizes</a> expected for the entire &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup, and it serves as a good reminder about what to expect from Apple's lowest-priced flagship.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; will feature a larger 6.27-inch display, which will make it the same size as the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> display. With the 16 Pro and Pro Max, Apple introduced larger displays, while the 16 and 16 Plus stayed the same size as the 15 and 15 Plus.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; - 6.27-inch display, up from 6.12 inches.</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; - 6.55 inches.</li><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> - 6.27-inch display, identical to &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;.</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max - 6.86-inch display, no change from &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Apple rounds 6.27 to 6.3 inches and 6.86 to 6.9 inches, so basically, we're going to get an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; that are 6.3 inches, and the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max at 6.9 inches. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; has a new display size that Apple will likely round to 6.6 inches. It will be slightly smaller than the 6.7-inch display of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Plus it replaces.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from that new display size, the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; is shaping up to be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with the fewest changes in 2025. The &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models and the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; are rumored to have a new horizontal rear camera bar, but the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; camera will look the same as the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; camera.<br/>
<br/>
There are features to look forward to though, such as the 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate that's rumored to be expanding to the entire &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup, an improved 24-megapixel selfie camera, and a faster A19 chip.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/29/iphone-17-display-sizes/">iPhone 17 Display Sizes: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-display-sizes-what-to-expect.2457893/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
