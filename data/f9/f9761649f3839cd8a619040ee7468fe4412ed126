 
          <p>It&rsquo;s been almost five years since I wrote about tea. We just <em>Refreshed our Supplies</em> (<a href="https://nightdivestudios.com/blood_refreshed_supply/">get it?</a>) and feel the need to store my thoughts on the various Mariage Frères (MF) teas we&rsquo;ve bought over the years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a faithful fan ever since drinking a <a href="http://mariagefreres.com/">Mariage Frères</a> teabag on a team building session somewhere in 2012. Call me a snob, and while Palais des Thés and Whittard are generally a great choice as well, most MF teas are simply better. I even went to Paris and London just to get a new batch of MF tea. Their webshop was non-existent&mdash;it still is crappy now but functional. As they ship from France, shipping to Belgium usually is <code>€15</code>. No worries though, add a couple of hundred grams and you&rsquo;ll hit the <code>€150</code> free shipping quota in no-time. Ouch.</p>
<p>This post was inspired by Seb&rsquo;s <a href="https://site.sebasmonia.com/posts/2025-09-29-it-s-been-a-while--tea-reviews.html">tea reviews post</a>. Seb employs <em>Day of the Tentacle</em> Hoagies to score the teas. Since my retro gaming codex uses <a href="https://jefklakscodex.com/about/#rating"><em>Goblins 3</em> Blounts</a>, it seemed appropriate to apply here as well. Consider this my personal <a href="https://steepster.com/teas/mariage-freres?Green=on&amp;page=2&amp;sort=rating">Steepster database</a>. The following list is a reconstruction of purchase histories from my notebooks:</p>
<h2 id="black-teas">Black teas</h2>
<h3 id="pure">Pure</h3>
<p><strong>Bloomfield Darjeeling</strong></p>
<p>A spring first flush tea labelled <em>SFTGFOP1</em>: Super Fine Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe. Don&rsquo;t worry if your initial reaction to that is <em>Huh?</em>: it&rsquo;s a tea grading term denoting this is one of the highest qualities Dajeerling tea you can get, with the worst being labelled as <em>D</em>: Dust. That&rsquo;s what inside a regular tea bag. <em>Schol</em>.</p>
<p>I love this Bloomfield. It&rsquo;s the best Darjeeling I ever gulped down. It&rsquo;s also one of the most expensive coming in at around <code>€50</code> per <code>100 g</code> (in 2022, that was <code>€40</code>!). It&rsquo;s subtle, not bitter if you steep it too long, has a lovely golden colour, can be re-steeped, and does not hit as hard as longer fermented black teas.</p>

<p>5 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Namring Royal Upper</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Darjeeling tea: here&rsquo;s another high quality variant from one of the oldest and largest tea estates in the Indian city. I love to think it looks as picturesque as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darjeeling#/media/File:Tea_plantation_Darjeeling.JPG">this Wikipedia plantation photo</a>, but in reality, it will no doubt be a lot of hard work to carefully pluck the best Orange Pekoe leaves each season.</p>
<p>We bought Namring to see if Bloomfield could be beaten. It couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;the difference is negligible and this one is even more expensive. Still great, though.</p>

<h3 id="scented">Scented</h3>
<p><strong>Earl Grey Provence</strong></p>
<p>This must have been the first typical black Mariage Frères canister I&rsquo;ve ever bought. I chanced upon it whilst Christmas shopping in a new cooking shop in my home town that&rsquo;s unfortunately long gone now. Earl Grey Provence is what it says it is: it&rsquo;s Earl Grey tea with a dose of Provence: lavender.</p>
<p>My wife thinks it smells like bath water when I prepare a cup, but I don&rsquo;t care. The combination is perfect, and the smell is more intense than the taste. It&rsquo;s not the highest quality/biggest leaves black tea they selected for this mix but it&rsquo;s not expensive either. If you like your Grey <em>Earl</em>-y (ha!) in the morning, try adding some lavender. Ingenious.</p>
<img src="/img/5.png" class="inline" title="5 out of 5">
<p>5 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Roi Des Earl Grey</strong></p>
<p>We must have bought kilos of <em>Early Grey Provence</em>, so to spice things up, last year I bought another Earl Grey variant: the king of the Earl Greys. Well&hellip; not so much. It&rsquo;s good, but the typical citrus-y flavour comes on a bit too strong in this one, since there&rsquo;s nothing else in it. I&rsquo;ll consider buying it again once in a while but it won&rsquo;t beat Provence.</p>
<img src="/img/3.png" class="inline" title="3 out of 5">
<p>3 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Good.</p>
<p><strong>Chaï Chandernagor</strong></p>
<p>Like I told you, I&rsquo;m a sucker for Indian tea when it comes to black ones, and &ldquo;chaï&rdquo; is not an exception. The term is usually used in the west (or at least here?) to describe spiced black tea where adding a dollop of milk is maybe perhaps a little bit allowed.</p>
<p>This mix doesn&rsquo;t just have cloves but some ginger and other stuff as well. Unfortunately, the black tea as a base is of relatively low quality and quite fine-grained. I&rsquo;ll admit: I prefer Palais des Thés&rsquo; simpler but more robust Chaï&mdash;<em>not</em> the Imperial one with the red pepper but the one with just cloves.</p>
<img src="/img/3.png" class="inline" title="3 out of 5">
<p>3 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Good.</p>
<p><strong>Chaï Parisien</strong></p>
<p>Another variant of spiced black tea with mellow fruity notes that come across as too mellow to me. If I want to drink a spiced black tea, I want to feel the kicker, not try to get the tongue tingled with &ldquo;mellow fruity notes&rdquo;. This one wasn&rsquo;t what I expect of a &ldquo;chaï&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="green-teas">Green teas</h2>
<h3 id="pure-1">Pure</h3>
<p><strong>Fuji-Yama</strong></p>
<p>The first MF tea I ever tasted and the one that got me hooked. It&rsquo;s a pure Japanese sencha tea grown near the foot of the Fuji-Yama mountain with that typical grassy flavour. The dried leaves even are long and small, reminiscent of dried grass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to screw up a batch by using too hot water or letting it steep for too long. It&rsquo;s been a while since we bought it because we&rsquo;re venturing into other flavours right now, but you can&rsquo;t go wrong with this if you&rsquo;re looking for a clean well-rounded tea to drink all day. Sencha is the most popular tea in Japan. If prepared well, the result is an appealingly looking greenish liquid. If overdone or prepared with too hot water, it&rsquo;ll yellow.</p>
<img src="/img/4.png" class="inline" title="4 out of 5">
<p>4 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Great.</p>
<p><strong>Tamaryokucha</strong></p>
<p>A grassy variant of the above that edges to the too grassy side for me. Weird, as tamaryokucha is usually considered milder than typical sencha tea. I cleaned out the tin today: we bought it over six years ago and I threw out almost half of it. Not because it&rsquo;s bad, but because you&rsquo;ve got to be in the right mood to drink this and there are others that somehow find their way into the tea strainer before it. Maybe try out <em>Fuji-Yama</em> first?</p>
<p>The term <em>Ryokucha</em> literally translates to &ldquo;green tea&rdquo; and is the parent category of sencha (steamed) and other pan-fried green teas. It&rsquo;s again unoxidized hence its bright green hue. Mental note: I should explore more Japanese teas.</p>
<img src="/img/3.png" class="inline" title="3 out of 5">
<p>3 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Good.</p>
<p><strong>Thai Mountain</strong> (rebranded to Royal Thai Tea)</p>
<p>According to MF, &ldquo;A gourmet tea that whisks us away to the heart of Asia&rdquo;. The tea leaves are hand-rolled into tiny balls that slowly open as it steeps, unleashing round milky flavours. It&rsquo;s hard to describe and not very cheap but you only need a few &ldquo;balls&rdquo; and it can be re-steeped multiple times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unique enough to warrant a spot in your tea cabinet, although I&rsquo;m unsure about its staying qualities. It was gifted to me and I have yet to buy a new batch, but I welcomed the occasional Thai Mountain cup during the day.</p>
<img src="/img/4.png" class="inline" title="4 out of 5">
<p>4 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Great.</p>
<p><strong>Genmaicha</strong></p>
<p>Not necessarily to be categorized as &ldquo;pure&rdquo;. Another typical Japanese green tea mixed with roasted rice. I have yet to drink this one but bought it because the last genmai cha I got from the Portland Japanese Garden was amazing, although that one also contained a bit of matcha.</p>
<p>To be rated soon!</p>
<h3 id="flowery">Flowery</h3>
<p><strong>Marco Polo Vert</strong></p>
<p>This is MF&rsquo;s flagship tea that&rsquo;s available as black, green, blue (yeah don&rsquo;t ask), and white teas. It&rsquo;s got a balanced flowery and fruity taste that leans towards vanilla&mdash;literally and figuratively. The tea is a good entry point towards more flowery/sweet-ish green teas&mdash;it&rsquo;s their flagship for a reason&mdash;if that is what you&rsquo;re after. After we finished our supply, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m inclined to buy more.</p>
<img src="/img/3.png" class="inline" title="3 out of 5">
<p>3 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Good.</p>
<p><strong>Ume Cha</strong></p>
<p>A beautiful limited edition canister served for a beautiful price (at this point of writing a dazzling <code>€40,25</code> per <code>100 g</code>) but worth it if you&rsquo;re a true tea believer. The green tea selected for this delicate infusion of plum blossoms is great and the fruity tones are not overwhelming. It&rsquo;s simply a superb fruity green tea. Too bad that stupid canister and the limited availability drives up the price.</p>
<img src="/img/5.png" class="inline" title="5 out of 5">
<p>5 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Sakura 2000</strong></p>
<p>One of the first fruity MF green teas that we tried and we keep reaching for. Personally, I&rsquo;d prefer Ume, but given the big price difference and the fact that my wife prefers cherry blossom over plum blossom, we always buy a package of <em>Sakura</em> when ordering online.</p>
<p>The flavour is perhaps a bit too much and after years of drinking it, it can get a bit repetitive, but if you don&rsquo;t know what fruity tea to get and your budget is limited, make it this one.</p>
<img src="/img/4.png" class="inline" title="4 out of 5">
<p>4 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Great.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Shanghaï</strong></p>
<p>A rather heavily perfumed tea with hints and notes of a bit of everything, from rose leaves to exotic fruits. I liked it a lot at first, but the more I drank it, the less enthusiastic I became. I&rsquo;d rather have a single dominating flavour than a sweet Shanghaï explosion. Still, I wouldn&rsquo;t say no to it. It&rsquo;s on par with Marco Polo, I guess.</p>
<img src="/img/3.png" class="inline" title="3 out of 5">
<p>3 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Good.</p>
<p><strong>Vert Amande</strong></p>
<p>I used to be very into almonds. I still like a good chunk of marzipan during the local <em>Sinterklaas</em> festivities, but it should stay outside my tea, thank you very much. Almond scented tea tends to become almond water with traces of tea, and this one is no exception.</p>
<img src="/img/1.png" class="inline" title="1 out of 5">
<p>1 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Bad.</p>
<h3 id="jasmine">Jasmine</h3>
<p><strong>Jasmin Imperial</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;‘The King of Jasmine Teas’ is made with very rare green tea.&rdquo;, as stated by MF. As jasmine green tea fans, We tried three different jasmine flavours, and this one hits the sweet spot, although the differences are perhaps too small. The added difficulty is that we stocked these three teas at different times so couldn&rsquo;t do a direct comparison. Feel free to pick whatever you desire, but a jasmine green tea should always be part of your default tea attire.</p>
<img src="/img/4.png" class="inline" title="4 out of 5">
<p>4 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Great.</p>
<p><strong>Grand Jasmin Beauty</strong></p>
<p>Brown-silver dried green tea buds/leaves that result in a golden liquid which can be easily confused by Darjeeling tea. It&rsquo;s still jasmine, only at <code>€31,10</code> per <code>100 gr</code>, a bit too expensive to notice the biggest difference in flavour. I&rsquo;m sure objectively speaking it&rsquo;s got a slight edge over Jasmin Imperial.</p>
<img src="/img/4.png" class="inline" title="4 out of 5">
<p>4 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Great.</p>
<p><strong>Jasmin Monkey King</strong></p>
<p>Green tea from Hunan scented with jasmine flowers. More gray-greenish than the jasmine teas above. We found this one to be the least impressive jasmine tea&mdash;I think? It&rsquo;s been a while, this year we only stocked Jasmin Imperial. As far as I can remember, it was still good.</p>
<img src="/img/3.png" class="inline" title="3 out of 5">
<p>3 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Good.</p>
<h2 id="white-teas">White teas</h2>
<h3 id="pure-2">Pure</h3>
<p><strong>Paï Mu Tan</strong></p>
<p>I was curious about pure white tea but now I&rsquo;m not any more. It&rsquo;s just not for me: it tastes like&hellip; nothing? White tea is very delicate, and perhaps my Earl Grey Provence and spiced Chaï got my taste buds confused. The leaves are beautiful, and however I try to prepare it, I just don&rsquo;t like it. I&rsquo;d rather not drink it.</p>
<img src="/img/1.png" class="inline" title="1 out of 5">
<p>1 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Bad.</p>
<h3 id="flowery-1">Flowery</h3>
<p><strong>Pavillon De Laque</strong></p>
<p>Same problem as Paï Mu Tan but slightly less so due to the added fragrances of mild spices. The blue flowers lend it a nice and colourful touch but for us it&rsquo;s not a saving grace. I guess we&rsquo;re just not white tea people. The fact that this tea is the most expensive in this entire list&mdash;<code>€56,40</code> per <code>100 g</code>&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t make it better. I kind of feel cheated.</p>
<img src="/img/2.png" class="inline" title="2 out of 5">
<p>2 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Mediocre.</p>
<p><strong>White Rhapsody</strong></p>
<p>Just when I thought &ldquo;okay let&rsquo;s skip all white teas from now on&rdquo;, my mother-in-law gifts me a canister of White Rhapsody. I read the label&mdash;scented white tea&mdash;and moan. Still, I politely accept the gift, put on the kettle, and take a sip. Holy shit! This tea is amazing!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what MF did to make this work, or perhaps it&rsquo;s because we drink a lot of flowery green tea, but I love the combination of what they call &ldquo;summery nuances evoking peach, apricot and fig&rdquo;. Highly recommended. I was distraught when I learned it was out of stock when I placed a new order last week.</p>
<img src="/img/5.png" class="inline" title="5 out of 5">
<p>5 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Amazing.</p>
<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p><strong>Rouge Pleine Lune</strong></p>
<p>This one&rsquo;s a rooibos tea mostly flavoured with almonds. And despite my last remark about almonds in teas, this time, the combination seems to mostly work. I&rsquo;m not a huge rooibos expert and only occasionally drink it plain. We&rsquo;ve had this one in a back shelf for years and I recently decided to give it another go. It&rsquo;s not half bad but I wouldn&rsquo;t be inclined to order more.</p>
<img src="/img/3.png" class="inline" title="3 out of 5">
<p>3 out of 5 Blounts&mdash;Good.</p>
<p><strong>Pu-erh Suprême</strong></p>
<p>Curious to fermented pu-erh teas, I ordered my first one last week. I just had a cup and must have done something wrong: it was surprisingly bland. Perhaps it needs more heat, I treated it like green tea. I&rsquo;ll give it a few more goes before putting up a rating.</p>
