<p>There is an online (gated) version at <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/60089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford Academic</a>. (It supposedly comes out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Derek-Parfit-His-Life-Thought/dp/0192894242?crid=1561IAD31U121&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.LIX6uqJp1uuwCM6HgGF12A.vn1RZp_mHefcvujkvIMOV873Fs3JQ0H12Uq2eZz3RGM&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=Derek+Parfit%3A+His+Life+and+Thought&amp;qid=1747831564&amp;sprefix=derek+parfit+his+life+and+thought%2Caps%2C85&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dainou-20&amp;linkId=de3d953503d2d61498b807dc9e25563a&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in print</a> in June, though Amazon says September.)</p>
<p>It contains essays by family members and philosophers who were close to him.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/60089/chapter/519750218?login=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter</a> by his wife, philosopher <a href="https://www.uehiro.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-janet-radcliffe-richards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janet Radcliffe Richards</a>, in which she discusses their lives together, her recognition of the signs that Parfit had some kind of autism, and how that has helped her better understand him and their relationship.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Derek was never anything other than supportive and admiring, and once I had stopped looking for things that were simply not there and working on the very many things that were, it was an easy and a very affectionate relationship. We both eventually had a clear understanding of what was going on and learned to treat the differences as humorous. When he said he loved me, as he often did, I would look arch, and he would say, “I have a funny way of showing it?” Then he might say, “I have loved you in my fashion,” (quoting Poe). “Would you rather I loved you in someone else’s fashion?” To that I would say, “Yes, of course.” But who knows? I certainly wanted more from him than there was to be got, but on the other hand if the missing module had been there, could Derek still have been what he was in other ways? Probably not; Baron-Cohen quotes Asperger as saying, “It seems that for success in science or art, a dash of autism is essential” (169). If you really are to devote your life to the pursuit of the sublime, it is as well not to be distracted by normal interpersonal emotions.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Anyway, I was not deterred, even though—or perhaps because?—I realized very early on that I was a relatively small part of his life. I remember telling someone that I was “his other . . . quarter”. I did not want a normal domestic life, either. I would have managed my own life very differently if I had understood Derek earlier, but I don’t think I would not have stayed with him. I could not have married anyone else.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The fact is, he was the love of my life, and it is rather hard to explain why in any further terms. I am materially better off than I would have been if our incomes had not been joined, of course, but that was never any kind of issue: I was happily independent when we met and could have remained so. There was nothing gained in the way of reflected status, since for many years most people who were aware of either of us did not know about the connection with the other; in fact, I think that in the eyes of some people who were aware of it, my philosophical standing was if anything diminished, because in Derek’s circle I was merely his partner, and barely known otherwise. He did not open up new opportunities for me; on the contrary, I rather dropped out of public view when we lived together. He did not widen my social circle, because he did not have one; in practice (not deliberately), he severely contracted it. He was of little use for anything recreational, because we did together only what he wanted to do, and soon after I met him most possibilities of that kind were perpetually over the horizon. He did not in any way advance my career: he was neither my teacher nor my referee, and I had started to establish my terrain—very different from his—before I knew him. I learned an enormous amount from him, of course; but I did not often find it helpful to discuss my work with him. Even my eventual return to Oxford had nothing to do with him.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>As he never seemed a means to any further end, therefore, I presume he must have been the end in himself. I once found myself saying, “Women will put up with a lot for a high enough calibre man.” Maybe I was right, at least in a rare case like this, where the high calibre comes with undemandingness, kindness, and manifest appreciation and affection.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Like my cat, Derek did simply what he wanted to do. </em></p>
