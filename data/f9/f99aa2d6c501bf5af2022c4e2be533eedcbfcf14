<p>John Dvorak <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/the-apple-itime-is-destined-to-fail">back in 2014</a>, two months before Apple Watch was announced:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I got a lecture from a potential buyer, who will only purchase an
iTime as a replacement for the iPhone rather than an accessory.
But all evidence leads me to believe this device will be an
accessory.</p>

<p>Doing that limits the appeal to people who were promised a
sleeker gadget profile, which they desperately need, because they
never manage to pare down anything. It’s tablet computing all
over again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If he’d meant that Apple Watch would be like the iPad, in terms of being a durable long-term <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/charts-apple-caps-off-best-fiscal-year-with-q4-record/">many-billion-dollars-in-sales-per-quarter</a> platform, he’d have been correct. But he meant that both were duds.</p>
