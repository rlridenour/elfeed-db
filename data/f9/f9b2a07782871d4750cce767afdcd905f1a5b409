Samsung may mirror Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup model positioning by eliminating its own "plus" model next year, according to rumors coming out of Asia.<br/>

This year, Apple is expected to remove the "Plus" model from the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup due to low sales, replacing it with an all-new, super-thin "Air" model. As a result, the lineup will move from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max to the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, 17 Air, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Samsung's rival lineup consists of the Galaxy S25, S25+, S25 Edge, and S25 Ultra. According to the Weibo leaker known as "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Instant Digital</a>," Samsung could next year replace its plus model with the super-thin Edge, just like Apple. The new lineup would be formed of the Galaxy S26, S26 Edge, and S26 Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
Both the S25+ and S25 Edge share a 6.7-inch display, Snapdragon 8 chip, 50-megapixel main camera, and more; there is significant overlap between the devices. Key differences include the Galaxy Edge's move to titanium instead of aluminum, its lack of a telephoto camera, and its ultra-thin design. <br/>

Earlier this year, Samsung beat Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-2/">launching a super-thin smartphone</a>; the S25 Edge is just 5.8mm thick. Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a> could be even thinner at 5.5mm. It is expected to launch alongside the other &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models in the fall.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/galaxy/">Galaxy</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/14/samsung-could-kill-its-plus-model-like-apple/">Samsung Could Kill Its Plus Model, Just Like Apple</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-could-kill-its-plus-model-just-like-apple.2461504/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
