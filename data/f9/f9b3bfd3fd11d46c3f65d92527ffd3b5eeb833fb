All Apple Watch models include a stock Calculator app that offers a couple of handy features for working out how much you should tip when eating out and how much each person in a group owes if you're splitting the bill.<br/>

The two functions can be used together, but if it's just yourself dining out then you can just leave the People field set to 1. The steps below show you how it works.  <br/>
<br/>
Note: If you see a standard percentage (%) button where the TIP button should be, you can change the calculator layout to replace it. Simply go to <strong>Settings ➝ Calculator</strong> and select <strong>Tip Function</strong> instead of <strong>Percent</strong>. <br/>

You'll see the total amount below the two fields change to reflect your tip adjustments, and the amount below that will change depending on how many people are paying. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/split-bill-tip-on-apple-watch/">How to Split a Bill and Tip on Apple Watch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-split-a-bill-and-tip-on-apple-watch.2458139/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
