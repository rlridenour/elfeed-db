<p id="p2">Today, Logitech introduced an updated version of its MX Master series mouse dubbed the MX Master 4. It&rsquo;s a good upgrade, but the changes are largely incremental; while I like it a lot, the MX Master 4 won&rsquo;t be for everyone. Logitech sent me the MX Master 4 to try, and I&rsquo;ve been using it for the past couple of weeks, so I thought I would share what the experience has been like so far.</p>
<p id="p3"><!--more--></p>
<p id="p4">I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Logitech&rsquo;s MX Master line of mice since the 2S, and before the MX Master 4 showed up at my door, I was using the MX Master 3S mouse for Mac. It&rsquo;s comfortable, has a great scroll wheel, and is highly customizable. However, the soft touch surface over most of the top did mean it got dirty quite easily.</p>

<p id="p6">That&rsquo;s changed with the MX Master 4. Gone is most of the soft ribbed surface of the 3S. Instead, both of the MX Master 4&rsquo;s buttons and most of its body are made of hard plastic. There is still some soft touch material along the right-hand side and under the surface where you place your thumb, which helps you grip the mouse. However, the top surfaces where my MX Master 3S got dirty are all hard surfaces that shouldn&rsquo;t discolor and are easy to wipe off.</p>
<p id="p7">At first glance, it&rsquo;s easy to mistake the MX Master 4 for the 3S. The overall shape of the top of the mouse is similar, but you&rsquo;ll notice that there are fewer seams around the buttons, and the slope of the underside that rises to meet the top of the mouse is more dramatic. The effect is a more sleek, modern look.</p>
<p id="p8">On the bottom of the mouse, which is flatter than the 3S&rsquo;s, you&rsquo;ll also find a different pattern for the smooth pads that help the MX Master 4 glide along your table or desk. According to Logitech, the six black screws on the bottom of the mouse are designed to make the mouse easier to take apart for recycling or repair, too. Also gone is the silver strip of plastic along the base of the MX 3S as well as the silver underside. Instead, everything about the MX Master 4 is color-matched, with the buttons also encased in a semi-transparent plastic that gives the device a more futuristic look.</p>

<p id="p10">As for connectivity, Logitech has finally updated its wireless Bolt receiver with a USB-C connector. Logitech says that the new receiver and antenna in the MX Master 4 combine for a 2&times; stronger connection than the 3S. With USB-C adoption so widespread today, most people should have no trouble finding a place to plug in the Bolt receiver. However, you can also connect via Bluetooth, and like the mouse that it replaces, the MX Master 4 can be paired with up to three different devices.</p>
<p id="p11">Logitech has also incorporated haptic feedback into the MX Master 4. As you use it, you&rsquo;ll feel tactile responses from automations, shortcuts, and notifications. For example, when you first set up the mouse and download its software, you&rsquo;ll feel haptic responses acknowledging that your mouse has been properly set up. And if you use the Actions Ring feature, a menu of shortcuts that can radiate from your pointer thanks to Logitech&rsquo;s Options+ software, you&rsquo;ll get haptic feedback when you mouse over the options, as well as when you select one.</p>
<p id="p12">The Actions Ring has been given a dedicated button on the MX Master 4 that sits under your thumb, and it shows a lot of potential. The feature reminds me of a <a href="https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stream Deck</a> or a similar device like Logitech&rsquo;s own <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/first-look-logitechs-mx-creative-console-is-poised-to-compete-with-elgatos-stream-deck-lineup/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Console</a>. Instead of hardware, though, the Actions Ring is hardware-activated software that allows you to assign different actions to its buttons that can change based on the app you&rsquo;re using. I haven&rsquo;t used the Actions Ring extensively yet, but the convenience of having a dedicated button for frequently used menu items and other actions under my thumb is something I&rsquo;m excited to spend more time with.</p>
<p id="p13">Other notable features of the MX Master 4 include the quietest button clicks of any MX Master mouse yet, up to 70-day battery life, and optical tracking of up to 8,000 DPI.</p>

<p id="p15">The updates to the MX Master 4 are not monumental, so 3S users whose mice are in good shape may want to hold off on updating. However, if you&rsquo;ve never tried the MX Master series of mice, or if you&rsquo;re still using an older 2S or similar model, the new MX Master 4 is an excellent upgrade. The build quality is superb, plus the inclusion of haptics and the highly customizable Actions Ring add to the overall experience of using the MX Master 4.</p>
<p id="p16">The MX Master 4 mouse comes in Graphite and Pale Gray globally and Black and Graphite Charcoal in North America and Europe. The MX Master Mouse for Mac comes in White Silver and Space Black and doesn&rsquo;t include the Bolt receiver but is otherwise the same as the MX Master 4 mouse. Both variants <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us" rel="noopener noreferrer">are available now for $119.99 directly from Logitech</a> and will ship in October. <a href="https://amzn.to/4nAjU3c" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon has the MX Master 4 in stock</a>, too, listing October 5 as the delivery date.</p>
