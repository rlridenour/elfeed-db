<p>If you’ve been paying any attention to social media lately, you’ve probably noticed how much better AI multi-modal art has gotten. The <em>zeitgeist</em> has definitely latched onto this — mainly to generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a>-style art of themselves.</p>



<p>It’s impressive and once again raises the big questions about AI and art. Artists spend years honing their craft. Now, with these new tools, anyone is just a prompt or two away from generating convincing images of themselves and their friends. How are we supposed to feel about that?</p>

<p>I’m still working through my own thoughts on AI and intellectual property, but one thing’s for sure: this toothpaste isn’t going back in the tube.</p>



<p>As an example, I had the new ChatGPT engine generate some drawings for a recent <a href="https://learn.macsparky.com/courses/enrolled/2726011">Productivity Field Guide</a> webinar I did on Habits being a useful tool for becoming your best self. I explained to ChatGPT that I wanted to illustrate how habits, once ingrained, become part of your identity. It made this image. Remarkable.</p>
