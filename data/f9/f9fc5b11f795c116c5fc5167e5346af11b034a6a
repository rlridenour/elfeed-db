In the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, there's some curious wording for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> setting that references a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a display, perhaps hinting at a future product that could come out sometime in the not too distant future.<br/>

There’s a location-related setting that has the following wording:<br/>
<blockquote>Your HomePod won't be able to show you the local weather, time, or respond to Siri requests about your area.</blockquote><br/>
"Show" is an interesting word for Apple to choose, because right now, the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; isn't able to show anything like the weather or the time because it doesn’t have a screen to display the information.<br/>
<br/>
There have been multiple rumors of a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a display over the last few years, and the screen-equipped &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; may in fact turn out to be the home hub that Apple has in development. <br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that the hub will have an iPad-like display, but with a square shape rather than a rectangular shape. It will be able to control all of your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> and Matter devices, plus it will run Apple apps like Weather, Calendar, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/">Apple News</a>, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> integration is expected, with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; able to answer questions similar to how the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; works. In fact, Apple has reportedly delayed the launch of the home hub due to the issues that it has had developing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There's no clear word yet on when the home hub will launch due to the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; delays, but we could see it late this year or early next year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-26/">iPadOS 26</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">Apple Command Center</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-26.248">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/22/homepod-with-display-ios-26/">Hints of HomePod With Screen Found in iOS 26</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hints-of-homepod-with-screen-found-in-ios-26.2462030/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
