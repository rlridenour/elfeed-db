Registered developers can download the betas from the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> by going to the General section and selecting the Software Update option.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26.3 adds a new tool for transitioning from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to an Android device. Transfers can be initiated during the device setup process, and moving data from one device to another can now be done without having to download a specific app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's transfer process supports moving photos, messages, notes, apps, passwords, phone number, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The update also includes a Notification Forwarding setting for third-party wearables in the European Union, and there are some minor changes to the Weather wallpaper.
