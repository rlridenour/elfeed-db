Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> introduces a series of small improvements, so how does it compare to the original model from 2021?<br/>
<br/>

The second-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; arrives five years after the original, bringing improvements to tracking range, speaker output, and internal design while retaining the same outward design and accessory compatibility. At the same time, first-generation AirTags remain available from some retailers at reduced prices, raising the question of whether the newer model is worth choosing over the original, or whether the earlier &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; still makes sense as a lower-cost option.<br/>
<br/>
The comparison below outlines every difference between the two generations, including Apple-announced feature upgrades and hardware changes identified through teardowns. While both models perform the same core function of tracking items through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> network, there are some small differences worth noting:<br/>

For buyers choosing between the two &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; models, the decision depends less on basic tracking and more on how and where an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; is typically used. Both generations rely on the same &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network for long-distance location updates, offer similar battery life, and work with the same accessories, so neither model is considerably better for general item tracking.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; is likely to benefit users who frequently rely on Precision Finding rather than approximate location. The extended Ultra Wideband range makes it easier to determine the specific location of items, while the louder speaker improves audibility in noisy spaces or when an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; is buried inside a bag or suitcase. Support for Precision Finding on compatible Apple Watch models also makes the newer &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; more convenient for users who often leave their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; behind.<br/>
<br/>
The first-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; remains a practical option for the overwhelming majority of use cases, such as tracking keys, backpacks, or household items that are usually misplaced within short distances. If available at a meaningful discount, it may offer better value for users who do not need Precision Finding at extended range, do not use an Apple Watch for item location, or simply want basic &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; functionality at the lowest cost.<br/>
<br/>
For existing &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; owners, there is certainly no pressing need to upgrade. For new buyers, the second-generation &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; simply offers the most complete feature set and greater flexibility going forward, acting as a moderate specification bump over the previous model.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/">AirTag</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtag-1-vs-airtag-2/">AirTag 1 vs. AirTag 2 Buyer&#039;s Guide: All 15+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airtag-1-vs-airtag-2-buyers-guide-all-15-differences-compared.2476852/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
