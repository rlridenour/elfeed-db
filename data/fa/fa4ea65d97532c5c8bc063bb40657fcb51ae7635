<p>The US Justice Department published its largest public release yet of records tied to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, posting about 3 million pages alongside roughly 180,000 images and 2,000 videos, with “extensive redactions”. The release was framed as compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed last year, though some outlets reported the department missed an earlier deadline set by a law signed by President Donald Trump. The newly public material references a wide range of high-profile people across politics, business, and royalty; several reports stress that being mentioned does not itself amount to an allegation or charge. At the same time, survivors and some lawmakers argue the disclosure is incomplete and may expose victims’ identifying information while leaving key details about perpetrators obscured, fueling renewed calls for accountability and careful handling of sensitive records. Outside the United States, the release quickly triggered official pushback and political pressure: India rejected any insinuation of impropriety tied to a reference involving Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (formerly known as Prince Andrew) to cooperate with US investigators and lawmakers, emphasizing the priority of victims.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/rklj899j47i9H5GM04oQmTawJD9wP7Nl8YUofWbBJmaOYHLkblAb8dToqOWI1vbBD0XjIm5VR1h1sFBN_YN7oKDl2HJ_n6AB1xwM_D-Xhp4BHov3GZMvJdc_L2d4dwmjEGaPb9NNBZwUQ-k-PwdOoAyvCRozhGjrEP8AYpGgKjfQ7GiVNaLYWbEaL-VpV_foKlfmO4Z_hJrCDrWUoZNYsEKZfS0' alt='A Justice Department-related image used to illustrate the latest Epstein records release.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Survivor concerns: Eighteen Epstein survivors said the document dump was “being sold as transparency” but instead “expose survivors,” alleging names and identifying details appeared while abusers remained “hidden and protected”.</li><li>Royal focus: Files released Friday include an August 2010 email exchange in which Epstein offered then-Duke of York Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor a dinner with a woman described as “26, russian, clevere beautiful, trustworthy,” and they also include images that drew renewed attention to Andrew’s ties to Epstein.</li><li>UK political pressure: Keir Starmer said anyone with relevant information should be prepared to share it and pointed to victims as the first priority, urging Andrew to answer questions in the US, including before Congress.</li><li>India rebuttal: India’s government dismissed an Epstein-files reference linked to Prime Minister Modi’s 2017 Israel visit as baseless, calling it “trashy ruminations” by a convicted criminal.</li><li>Australia denial: Former Australian prime minister and outgoing US ambassador Kevin Rudd said diary-style entries or scheduling notes should not be taken at face value and denied ever meeting Epstein or visiting his homes, after a file suggested a 2014 meeting had been scheduled.</li></ul><blockquote>I have always approached this question with the victims of Epstein in mind.
