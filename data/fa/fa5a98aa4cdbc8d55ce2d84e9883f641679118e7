<p>There’s something so bizarrely asymmetrical about Trump’s political support. We saw large scale protests like today’s starting in 2017 too, and in this 2.0 administration, they’re only going to get bigger. Today’s protests were coast-to-coast, in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/peterbowdenlive.bsky.social/post/3lm3ahz5pp22d">cities</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/peterbowdenlive.bsky.social/post/3lm3ahz5pp22d">large</a> and <a href="https://me.dm/@mgs/114286204556855230">small</a>. Hundreds of thousands — correction, <em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/05/us/hands-off-protests-trump-musk/index.html">millions</a></em> — of people. Huge crowd <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mandiaholly/post/DIFRGyoPd_i?xmt=AQGzI-Oy3kcvBP6Lg5mLyKE0RO6Vnjit3SUnIMLATFjV3A">in Philadelphia</a>. Over 100,000 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/peterbowdenlive.bsky.social/post/3lm3ahz5pp22d">in Boston</a>. But there were never any protests at all against the Biden administration. Trump’s support has been just wide enough to win, twice, but it’s so thin. His first inauguration was <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2017/01/the-facts-on-crowd-size/">so conspicuously sparsely attended</a> they held the second one indoors. Support for democracy runs deep.</p>
