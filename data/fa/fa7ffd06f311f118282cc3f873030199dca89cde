Why in the world were my super and meta keys suddenly swapped? I finished a game and found that suddenly my alt/meta key and my super/windows key had swapped positions. I tried changing from Dvorak to Qwerty and back again, and tried restarting my keyboard and then restarting my whole computer, and found no explanation for the problem. Finally I found the answer1, which was that somewhere in my baby-in-arms, trying-to-keyboard-with-one-hand, I had switched my keyboard into mac mode, which inverts the super and meta keys and destroys my carefully crafted muscle memory.
