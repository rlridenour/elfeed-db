<p>Used bookstores are my arch nemesis.</p>
<p>I have two such stores in disturbingly close proximity to me. The first is Boomerang Books—within a short walk of my house and right next to Burgers Supreme (almost as dangerous)—and they carry textbooks at a fifth of the original price. Last time I went there I walked out with a book on graph theory I most certainly don&rsquo;t need. The second is Pioneer Book. My wife and I went there on a date a couple of months ago. I walked out with a dozen books.</p>
<p>My wallet has suffered.</p>
<p>What keeps me hooked is that my wallet has suffered <em>much less</em> than it would if they were not used books, though!</p>
<p>The serendipity is what gets me. I was walking up the stairs when I passed a copy of <em>Walden</em> be Emerson that was waiting to be sorted and shelved. I picked it up and added it to the pile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much more my bookshelf can take. The books are already stacked two deep. I just need to make time, dig in, and start reading. Maybe I can give back some of those wonderful books after I&rsquo;ve finished them.</p>
