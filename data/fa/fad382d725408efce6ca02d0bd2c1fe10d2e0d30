Over at the Emacs subredit, iinnssdd says <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1o5bigj/this_is_what_i_have_learned_to_speed_up_emacs/">he was looking for a guide to speed up Emacs</a> but couldn&rsquo;t find one. Therefore, <a href="https://github.com/D4lj337/Emacs-performance">he put together his own</a>. This is more than the usual &ldquo;how to make Emacs load faster&rdquo; article, which <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=13328">we all know are silly and a waste of time</a>. Although there are some suggestions for making Emacs load faster, the useful parts are how to make Emacs run faster once it&rsquo;s loaded.

Some of that are compile time options when building Emacs from source. Iinnssdd&rsquo;s particular options may or may not apply to your situation but they&rsquo;re worth taking a look at. Another obvious strategy is to make sure that you have native compilation enabled. Iinnssdd has some suggestions for that.

A couple of specific recommendations are applicable to many of us. They&rsquo;re both pretty simple and easy to implement. The first is a hook function to the <code>find-file</code> function that looks at how many lines the function has and turns off <code>display-lne-numbers-mode</code> when there are more than 1000 lines. It&rsquo;s easy to see why this would speed things up on large files.

The second speedup is similar. It&rsquo;s another <code>find-file</code> hook that looks for C files that have more than 1000 lines and turns on <code>simpc-mode</code> when it finds one. <a href="https://github.com/rexim/simpc-mode">Simpc</a> performs minimal syntax highlighting and indentation and, according to its author, is much faster than <code>c-mode</code>, <code>c++-mode</code>, <code>cc-mode</code>, and so on.

Even though I don&rsquo;t have native compilation enabled on my older MacBook (2019), I still don&rsquo;t find Emacs insufferably slow. That could be one of the benefits of having grown up with much older computers that were <i>really</i> slow. Regardless, if you&rsquo;re intent on squeezing every bit of performance from Emacs, Iinnssdd&rsquo;s post may give you some ideas.</p>
