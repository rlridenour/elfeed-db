<p>The title is a little bit misleading though. I have almost nothing dev related on my Windows machine and use Linux VM instead.</p>
<p>Here is the components my dev environment consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>VMware Workstation (VirtualBox would work too)</li>
<li>Windows Terminal</li>
<li>Vim (NeoVim to be precise)</li>
<li>Tmux and Tmuxinator</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vmware-workstation">VMware Workstation</h2>
<p>The actual product doesn&rsquo;t matter here. As I mentioned earlier VirtualBox would work as well.
I use VMware because I used to it and I blindly believe in rumors that it is faster than VirtualBox.</p>
<p>Along with some virtual machines I installed out of curiosity there is my main virtual machine configured.
I call it <strong>Workstation</strong> and I store there everything work/personal projects/this blog related.</p>
<p>The workstation is driven by <strong>Ubuntu Server</strong> with no Xorg installed. Whenever I need to run graphical Linux app I use VcXsrv.</p>
<p>One more thing worth to mention is that network in the workstation is configured with NAT
so I always know IP address of the VM regardless the network my laptop is connected to.
Even if my laptop has no internet connection I still can connect to my VM with no issues and can keep working.</p>

<p>The VM is always in such state because I connect to it with SSH
so I keep it in a separate virtual screen and if I need to suspend or wake it up I just do
a &ldquo;four finger swipe&rdquo; to switch to the screen with only VMware running.</p>
<p><strong>Why not WSL1/2</strong></p>
<p>I love WSL. I also like how WSL team switched to VM approach for their WSL2.
WSL just doesn&rsquo;t fit my workflow. I like to fire up the VM, work and suspend it so I can wake it up again when needed in a second
and continue from exactly that state I stopped in.</p>
<p>To stop WSL I literally need to stop all the main process like Nginx, Postgres, Tmux. Tmux main purpose is to be never stopped.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to keep WSL&rsquo;s VM running all the time.</p>
<p>So, even though I like the idea of WSL I can&rsquo;t use it.</p>
<h2 id="windows-terminal">Windows Terminal</h2>
<p>The reason I use it is I haven&rsquo;t found anything better. It&rsquo;s pretty lightweight, quick and configurable.</p>
<p>It has some issues with default configuration (CTRL+C copies text instead of process termination), Alt+Backspace doesn&rsquo;t remove a word (at least by default)
and some other small issues that can be fixed.</p>
<p>UI is super configurable too. I was able to remove tabs and scrollbar to make UI clean.</p>

<h2 id="vimneovim">Vim/NeoVim</h2>
<p>I tried lots of editors and I constantly switch from one to another but Vim is definitely the one I spent most of the time in directly or implicitly
(evil-mode in Emacs, VsCodeVim, Vintage in Sublime, IdeaVim in IDEs from JetBrains).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much used to it and to its keybindings.</p>
<p>You can find my vimrc <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/KryDos/24484288f4b80a4d60c4135b62f2ee84">HERE</a></p>
<p>It also plays nicely with Tmux.</p>

<h2 id="tmux">Tmux</h2>
<p>A window manager for my terminal.</p>
<ul>
<li>I run one session per project</li>
<li>Most of my sessions have 3 windows
<ul>
<li>bg - first window is for background jobs like npm watch, artisan serve, rails server</li>
<li>vim - I code here</li>
<li>cmd - a window I use to run some git commands or read logs or install missing libraries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I use panes occasionally when I need to start two background jobs for example.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use Tmuxinator for every project I have.
In case I had to restart my VM I can execute <code>tmuxinator project-name</code> and I automatically get
a new session with 3 windows created and Vim window focused with all background jobs required by the project running.</p>
<p><strong>So why do I need Windows at all if all my coding stuff are in Linux.</strong></p>
<p>Shortly - I like how Windows work.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like how any device connected to my laptop is recognized and don&rsquo;t require additional attention and configuration.</li>
<li>I got much more Kernel Panics and frozen X servers in Linux than I got BSODs in Windows.</li>
<li>I need Excel sometimes (LibreOffice is far behind).</li>
</ul>
