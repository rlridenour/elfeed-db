<p>The United States has sent a small team of military officers to Nigeria after recent attacks, U.S. officials said, as part of security cooperation meant to help Nigeria fight jihadist groups. Officials described the deployment as limited and focused on support, not a major new U.S. combat mission. The move comes as Nigeria continues to battle a long-running insurgency involving Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP). It also lands amid a dispute over how to describe the violence: President Trump has called it a “genocide” of Christians in Nigeria, a claim Nigeria’s government and many independent experts reject, saying the country’s security crises have killed both Christians and Muslims and often do not distinguish between them.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SCM3_fn0v3C5c1CiBaIhSP420KFVPFXVPEvimeAW3wCAoK-VBQgdAGJlm0kgbx8SwCdHAQTOop48ZORZ3KZJQssCQZyeIRgTXy4nljIt1eEtlQVmx_3vXXgl3izQC1hzhP6xTBr-9zP7h5aNESz5r7jTLdbkUafHH6IcuMJOFoTpn6mF6DX4C3h226dPgL9UYD5_V0DoU34GJYt4RRP47poZyWnhqMsZIl9QcgEpc4VKW36NcRKKmW3PCQ' alt='Soldiers stand guard before a visit from government officials following an attack by gunmen in Yelewata community, north-central Nigeria, June 16, 2025.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>AFRICOM briefing: Gen.
