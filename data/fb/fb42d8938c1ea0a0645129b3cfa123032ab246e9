While developing the live reload feature for <a href="https://scicloj.github.io/clay/">Clay</a>, a minimalistic Clojure tool for data visualization and literate programming, I found that it constantly takes ~1 minute for <a href="https://github.com/nextjournal/beholder">beholder</a> to watch a directory. After some code inspect, I was still having no idea why it happened.</p>

So I decided to use a profiler to find out what&#39;s going one under the hood, and Google immediately took me to <a href="https://clojure-goes-fast.com/kb/profiling/clj-async-profiler/">clj-async-profiler</a>. It&#39;s easy to set up following its <a href="https://clojure-goes-fast.com/kb/profiling/clj-async-profiler/basic-usage/">basic usage docs</a>:</p>
