I can’t stand your religious meetings. <br></br>
I’m fed up with your conferences and conventions. <br></br>
I want nothing to do with your religion projects, <br></br>
your pretentious slogans and goals. <br></br>
I’m sick of your fund-raising schemes, <br></br>
your public relations and image making. <br></br>
I’ve had all I can take of your noisy ego-music. <br></br>
When was the last time you sang to me? <br></br>
Do you know what I want? <br></br>
I want justice—oceans of it. <br></br>
I want fairness—rivers of it. <br></br>
That’s what I want. That’s all I want.
