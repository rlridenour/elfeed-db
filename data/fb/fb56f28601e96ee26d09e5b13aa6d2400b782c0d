<p>Years ago, I encountered a fascinating concept in a book by the Dalai Lama: every seven years, human beings transform into entirely new versions of themselves. This idea stems from the biological principle that our bodies replace virtually all their cells over a seven-year cycle. The person you are today doesn&#8217;t share a single cell with the version of you from seven years ago. (This is, of course, a generalization as some cells regenerate much faster and others a little slower.)</p>



<p>There&#8217;s something profoundly liberating about this constant state of transformation. We often become fixated on our past: mistakes we&#8217;ve made, opportunities we&#8217;ve missed, harms inflicted upon us (and by us), or wounds we&#8217;ve suffered. But what if we truly internalized that the person who experienced those things no longer exists in a physical sense?</p>



<p>I recently spoke with a friend who was still dwelling on something that happened thirty years ago. &#8220;Why do you care?&#8221; I asked him. &#8220;That was four versions of you ago. That person doesn&#8217;t exist anymore. Move on.&#8221;</p>



<p>This perspective applies equally to our future selves. The version of you that will exist seven years from now hasn&#8217;t formed yet. So why not focus your energy and attention on the present moment?</p>



<p>As you read these words, you are uniquely yourself, different from who you were a moment ago and who you&#8217;ll become in the next. By embracing this present version of yourself, you release yourself from the bonds of history while simultaneously doing the greatest possible favor to your future self.</p>



<p>We exist in a perpetual state of transformation: cellular, psychological, and spiritual. When we recognize and honor this constant evolution, we free ourselves to live more fully in the eternal now. Adopt the Seven-Year Rule. You’ll be doing yourself a favor.</p>
