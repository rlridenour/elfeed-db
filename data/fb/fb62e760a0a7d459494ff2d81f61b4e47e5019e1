Getting access to the macOS Tahoe developer beta is simple, and can be done by registering your Apple Account with the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">Apple Developer program</a>. The extra steps you need to complete to install the software on your Mac are provided towards the end of this article, but before you jump ahead, here are a few things worth considering.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Should I Install the macOS Tahoe Developer Beta?</h2><br/>
With macOS Tahoe, Apple introduces a major redesign for the platform with the all-new Liquid Glass interface, along with a host of new features. These include the Phone app on Mac, powerful new Spotlight actions, further Apple Intelligence integration, a dedicated Games app, and customizable backgrounds in Messages. Live Activities from iPhone also make their way to your Mac's menu bar, which now has a fully customizable Control Center. With so many additions and a striking visual update, it's no surprise that macOS Tahoe is generating a lot of interest among Mac users.<br/>
<br/>
But before you commit, bear in mind that Apple does not recommend installing macOS developer beta updates on your main Mac. Remember, this is beta software, which means there are almost certainly bugs and issues that can prevent software from working properly or cause other problems with the system. Indeed, one of the reasons that Apple releases the beta to developers early is so that they can feed back problems and help Apple debug them. If you have a spare Mac hanging around, by all means use that, but we would be the first to advise holding off until at least July, when the macOS Tahoe public beta is expected to drop.<br/>
