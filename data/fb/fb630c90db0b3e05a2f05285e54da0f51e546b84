Apple's high-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> desktop computer is currently "on the back burner," according to the latest word from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>

In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-16/apple-s-iphone-road-map-iphone-air-2-iphone-18-mac-pro-future-tesla-carplay-mi1q4l2o"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, Gurman said he heard that Apple has "largely written off" the Mac Pro, with the sentiment inside the company being that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> represents the present and future of Apple's pro desktop computing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is working on a high-end M5 Ultra chip, but Gurman said the company is currently "only" focused on a new Mac Studio with that chip, which leads him to believe that the Mac Pro "won't be updated in 2026 in a significant way."<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like Gurman has not heard anything about a Mac Pro with an M5 Ultra chip being in the works, but he has not entirely ruled out the possibility.<br/>
<br/>
In recent years, the Mac Pro has become redundant for many customers, as it is essentially a larger and more expensive Mac Studio with PCIe expansion slots. Apple last updated the Mac Pro with the M2 Ultra chip <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro">in June 2023</a>, and Gurman's wording suggests that the future of the computer may be in jeopardy.<br/>
