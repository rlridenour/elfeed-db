Apple improved the Math Notes feature in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> and iPadOS 26, allowing users to input equations to create graphs in three dimensions.<br/>

Math Notes was added in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>. It works in the Notes app, or through a Math Notes option that's accessible through the Calculator app. The feature is designed to solve math problems or equations when an equals sign is entered. On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Math Notes works with typed equations, but on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, you can write out equations by hand with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> and get in-line results.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and iPadOS 26, when you write an equation with three variables, Math Notes is able to create a graph with three dimensions. So, for example, if you write an equation like z=sin(x^2 + y^2), you'll get a ripple graph.<br/>
<br/>
To use the feature, write or type an equation and then tap on one of the variables and choose the Insert 3D graph option. 3D graphs can be enlarged, resized, and moved using tap and drag gestures. While it is available on both &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, the feature works better on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; due to the larger display area. If you're handwriting Math Notes on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, write an equation and then circle it to get to the graphing options.<br/>
<br/>
The new 3D graphic functionality could be useful for linear algebra and multivariable calculus visualizations, and the graphs that are output can be copied and pasted into other apps.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and iPadOS 26 are in the early stages of testing and are only available to developers at the current time. Apple plans to release a public beta in July, and a launch will follow in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/ipados-26-math-notes-3d-graphing/">iPadOS 26 Gets New 3D Graphing Feature for Math Notes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-26-gets-new-3d-graphing-feature-for-math-notes.2458898/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
