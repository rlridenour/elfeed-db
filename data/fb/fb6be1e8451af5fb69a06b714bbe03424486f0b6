The Apple Watch Ultra 3 replaces the second-generation model that was introduced two years ago in Apple's smartwatch lineup, but how different are the two successive smartwatch generations?<br/>

The two Apple Watch Ultra models share the overwhelming majority of their features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the second generation to save money? This breakdown serves as a way to see all the differences that the Ultra 3 brings to the table.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Series 11 represents <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-10-vs-series-11/">one of the smallest upgrades</a> to the mainstream model ever, while the Apple Watch Ultra 3 provides a bit bigger but still modest change compared to its predecessor.<br/>

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is a fairly minor upgrade over the second-generation model, with the most substantial changes focusing on the display. The new Apple Watch Ultra's display is a little larger, and it now features wide-angle OLED and LTPO3 for better viewing angles and a higher refresh rate when lowered, meaning there is a persistent ticking seconds hand on some watch faces.<br/>
<br/>
It features 5G connectivity for the first time alongside Emergency SOS via satellite, bringing two iPhone features to the Apple Watch. Battery life is slightly better and the device charges to 80% 15 minutes faster, but there are few upgrades of substance.<br/>
<br/>
It will likely not be worth upgrading from an Apple Watch Ultra 2 to an Ultra 3, even though they come two years apart. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 gains all of the same health features as the Ultra 3, and even its S9 chip has the same CPU as the S10; the S10 is simply a more compact version of the S9, so don't expect a performance boost. Owners of the first-generation Apple Watch Ultra from three years ago may have more reason to get the latest device, but it is far from an essential upgrade.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-ultra-2-vs-ultra-3/">Apple Watch Ultra 2 vs. Ultra 3 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 10 Upgrades Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ultra-2-vs-ultra-3-buyers-guide-10-upgrades-compared.2465867/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
