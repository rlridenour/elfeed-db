<p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado says Venezuela has entered the first steps of a democratic transition after a January 3 U.S. military operation seized then-President Nicolás Maduro. Speaking publicly in Washington, she urged U.S. leaders to keep pushing for a democratic government and said she remains confident Venezuela will eventually hold elections, while warning the road ahead is complicated because Maduro loyalists still hold power. Several reports say President Donald Trump’s administration has worked with an interim arrangement involving former vice-president Delcy Rodríguez, while Machado says she has a mandate and will lead the country when the time is right.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/8LhEL6ZDl5Dat-DLOfHVvRjM499K5wjEa2Z6mZ3RLFjaZz_myQZEx6-fqd9LZUv60caqXK9ZHF9bMtle1ApyUXg1hak_79NJgWyQo-g7EqxF84BaAG71Wmc2T5RyeH__riKCXTa8CoN5zBvaD0Xr90JJrLKc26R1DU4jkcjlanmP2H1ajsygRIgzyTz25R2pszx4AA' alt='Image related to U.S.-Venezuela political developments discussed in the reports.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Interim arrangement: Machado described Delcy Rodríguez’s interim government as tasked with doing the “dirty work” of assuring a democratic transition.</li><li>Pro-US pitch: She outlined a future Venezuela as “profoundly pro-American,” framing closer ties with Washington as part of her vision for rebuilding the country.</li><li>Unclear roadmap: Nearly two weeks after Maduro’s seizure, Machado offered few specifics on her own operational plans, even as she pressed U.S. officials to sustain pressure for democratic change.</li><li>Regime remnants: Machado argued that dismantling what she called the remaining “criminal regime” will take time, because power structures and loyalists tied to Maduro still operate inside the state.</li><li>Competing bets: Machado said Venezuela will become free with support from the U.S. and President Trump, even as reports describe the White House placing greater emphasis on Rodríguez in the interim period.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>María Corina Machado (Venezuelan opposition leader): She said Venezuela is in the early stages of a democratic transition and expects elections eventually, while emphasizing that the process will be complex and gradual.
