<p>Here are some of my favourite end of year / beginning of year resources and advice. I invite you to explore those that resonate with where you are in life at the moment.</p>
<h3 id="online-resources">Online resources</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stephango.com/40-questions" target="_blank">Steph Ango’s 40 questions</a></li>
<li>Carl Pullein’s <a href="https://www.carlpullein.com/downloads" target="_blank">Annual Planning template</a> (scroll down)</li>
<li><a href="https://nesslabs.com/annual-review-template" target="_blank">Anne Laure’s 15-page Annual Review template</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nesslabs.com/best" target="_blank">Anne Laure’s other articles</a>: peruse the list and click on the first headline that stands out. Anne-Laure also has a yearly group video guided planning session at the end of each year for Ness Labs members. I wasn’t able to attend due to time zone differences, but the session was recorded so I can participate at my leisure.</li>

<h3 id="resolutions-add-or-subtract">Resolutions: add, or subtract?</h3>
<p>Personally, I don’t do New Year’s resolutions. I prefer to check in every month (usually on Sundays) on how the things I’m doing are furthering my main values, or <a href="https://www.carlpullein.com/podcast/why-everything-must-start-from-your-areas-of-focus/14/9/2020" target="_blank">areas of focus</a>. See <a href="https://ellanew.com/2024/09/16/ptpl-122-value-driven-tasks" title="wikilink">2024-09-16 <span class="small-caps">PTPL</span> 122 - Aligning Your Task List with Your (Changing) Values</a></p>
<p>Mike Schmitz said recently <a href="https://practicalpkm.com/the-ultimate-productivity-hack/" target="_blank">the ultimate productivity hack</a> is to subtract things from your life, not add them. In my experience adding is usually better than subtracting, but it can require a mindset shift.</p>
<p>Focus your mind on adding the good thing you want to achieve (stronger muscles, a sense of peace and order at home, more time with family), have an attitude of working towards that, and you’ll come to see how to drop or adopt the practices needed to get you there. If your psyche resists losing things, you can work with, not against, that.</p>
<h3 id="the-magic-is-in-doing-the-small-things-and-to-know-why-youre-doing-them">The magic is in doing the small things, and to know <em>why</em> you’re doing them</h3>
<p>To finish, here are some links to past <a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl" title="wikilink"><span class="small-caps">PTPL</span></a> posts you may find helpful.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/062-human-joy-more-important-than-productivity" title="wikilink"><span class="small-caps">PTPL</span> 062</a> - An invitation to review your personal areas of focus, and create a personal manifesto.</em> Do you know what your productivity efforts are costing you? Take a moment to observe the time and attention you put into your work or solo hobbies, and consider how well it balances with what are ultimately your highest priorities. Keep in mind that human joy (your own, and that which you share with others) will always be more important than raw productivity.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>you can do (almost) anything, but you can’t do everything: not today, this week, or this life</strong>. Add one or two things to tomorrow’s to do list that will further a core area or value. Do this most days and results will come!</p>
<p><em><a href="https://ellanew.com/2023/05/22/ptpl-053-plain-text-vehicle-productivity-destination" title="wikilink"><span class="small-caps">PTPL</span> 053</a> - Digital independence is good, but it’s not all there is.</em> How tragic would it be if I devoted my entire life to building a finely-crafted system that reaches admirable pinnacles of future-proof, plain text app-agnosticism, only to realise at the end I’d neglected to actually <em>do</em> something worthwhile with my notes? The means are important but they’re the vehicle, not the destination.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://ellanew.com/2024/12/23/ptpl-136-no-new-year-resolutions-each-day-a-fresh-start" title="wikilink"><span class="small-caps">PTPL</span> 136</a> - Why do resolutions when every day is already a fresh start?</em> Each evening is an opportunity to plan for progress. What might happen if you created tomorrow in your head or on paper before the sun gets up, then slept on it? Plans don’t have to be perfect. It’s okay to start small and celebrate, if not a success, then the wonderful fact that you turned up rather than giving up.</p>
