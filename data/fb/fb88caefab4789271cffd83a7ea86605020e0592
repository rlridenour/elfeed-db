<p>In the latest development after Hong Kong’s deadliest fire in more than 70 years, Chief Executive John Lee has ordered a judge-led independent committee to investigate how a blaze at the Wang Fuk Court housing estate in Tai Po killed more than 150 residents last week and spread through seven high-rise towers housing over 4,000 people. Authorities say the fire raced up exterior scaffolding where contractors allegedly used plastic mesh and insulation foam that did not meet fire-resistance standards, and anti-corruption officers have detained a dozen people over suspected graft linked to the renovation works. Police have separately arrested 13 people on suspicion of manslaughter, and search teams have recovered scores of bodies from stairwells and rooftops while around 30 people remained unaccounted for as of Tuesday. Officials say the committee will examine building safety oversight and make recommendations to prevent similar tragedies, even as rights groups criticize the arrest of activists and a student who had called for greater transparency and accountability in the aftermath.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ieRR2Ws4c1SKyucz073qGKoszaTohPXy9rFXl0n54tGMeNkUztIUnj_q4AucF4uMwG4KTYZ9KR7ZBkTs0v_y3tJE5P_CqXx470wel-kuoV3R' alt='A firefighter searches a fire-damaged apartment in Hong Kong’s Wang Fuk Court complex after the deadly blaze.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Inquiry mandate: John Lee said the independent committee, led by a judge under Hong Kong’s existing commission-of-inquiry mechanism inherited from British rule, will scrutinize the causes of the blaze, why it spread so quickly, and any systemic issues in regulation and enforcement, before issuing recommendations.</li><li>Arrests and investigations: Beyond 13 manslaughter arrests by police, the Independent Commission Against Corruption has detained 12 people over alleged concealment of substandard netting and materials during renovation, signaling parallel criminal and anti-graft probes into responsibility for the disaster.</li><li>Residents’ immediate needs: Officials will briefly reopen the only unaffected residential block at Wang Fuk Court for two days so displaced residents can retrieve belongings, while fire victims describe tiring trips between agencies to access aid and call for a single, centralized relief platform.</li><li>Civil liberties concerns: Human rights organizations have urged authorities not to use colonial-era sedition laws against people demanding accountability, after reports that a student activist and others linked to concerned groups were detained for allegedly exploiting the tragedy.</li><li>Community solidarity: Amid days of mourning, Hong Kong firefighters have drawn praise for working more than 40 hours to battle the blaze and for rescuing many residents’ pets from the complex, with some owners saying the animal rescues gave them emotional strength to endure the loss of their homes.</li></ul><blockquote>In order to avoid similar tragedies again, I will set up a judge-led independent committee to examine the reason behind the cause and rapid spreading (of the fire) and related issues. - John Lee</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Hong Kong government: John Lee said a judge-led committee would uncover the reasons for the fire’s rapid spread and help prevent similar disasters, while warning he would not tolerate crimes that &quot;exploit the tragedy&quot; in reference to activist detentions.
