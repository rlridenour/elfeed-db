<li>Putting mats</li>
<li>They have college logos on them</li>
<li>Sorry if your college isn’t here</li>
<li>Is it available in Georgia Red: last time I said “yes,” but I was wrong; it turns out I don’t know college logos, so I will abstain from answering this question</li>
</ul><h1>Be True To Your School</h1><p>Every sport is equal parts physical and mental.</p>
<p>And then within the physical aspect of every sport, there are two sub-categories: power and finesse.</p>
<p>Building the power is, in some ways, harder. It takes a lot of work to get stronger. It can be painful. One big workout and you can spend the next week waking up sore. In golf, this would be working on your drive.</p>
<p>Finesse, meanwhile, can be a bit easier in terms of strain. But building that muscle memory to do something small and precise is absolutely necessary to master any game. In golf, this would be working on your putt.</p>
<p>That’s what you can do with these. They’re collegiate putting mats, allowing you to practice the art of getting the ball into the hole in the comfort of your own home or office.</p>
<p>But again, this is all to do with the physical.</p>
<p>The mental side of the game is something you’ll have to find inside yourself, or else all the physical practice is moot once you hit the links. You need to be able, in the tensest moments, to remain calm. And while you can work on these skills at any point in life, it really helps to start early.</p>
<p>Like, say, when you’re in college.</p>
<p>And it’s especially easy to find that sort of calm if you went to a… uhh… super chill school. You know, a place where everyone’s very… relaxed. A place like:</p>
<ul>
<li>St. Bongaventure</li>
<li>US(TH)C</li>
<li>Bake Forest</li>
<li>University of Toke-lahoma</li>
<li>Carnegie Mellow</li>
<li>Piperdine</li>
<li>Blunter College</li>
<li>Grassachusetts Institute of Technology</li>
<li>University of Weedsconsin</li>
<li>Puff-Puff-Passaic County Community College</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, wow. So stupid.</p>
<p>But these putting mats aren’t stupid. They’re cool. So get one if you want one.</p>
