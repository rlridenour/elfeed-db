<p>Professor Lingis specialized in phenomenology, existentialism, modern philosophy, and continental philosophy. He was known for his unique style which, according to the publisher of a <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/9781517905118/the-alphonso-lingis-reader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compilation of his writings</a>, &#8220;blends travel writing, cultural anthropology, and personal accounts of his innumerable experiences as an active participant in the adventures and relationships that fill his life.&#8221; He is the author of over 15 books, including <em>Excesses: Eros and Culture </em>(1983), <em>Phenomenological Explanations </em>(1986), <em>Abuses </em>(1994), <i>The Community of Those Who Have Nothing in Common</i> (1994), <em>Dangerous Emotions </em>(2000), and <em>Irrevocable: A Philosophy of Mortality </em>(2018), to name a few. He was also a translator of the works of Merleau-Ponty and Levinas, as well as a photographer.

<p>Lingis was a professor at Penn State since the 1960s. Prior to that, he taught at Duquesne University. He earned his PhD from the Catholic University of Leuven and his undergraduate degree at Loyola University in Chicago.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://thebeliever.net/an-interview-with-alphonso-lingis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> at <em>The Believer</em>, Lingis connected philosophy to freedom and equality, saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The original philosophical practice was to formulate statements that do not depend on the authority figures, tradition, ancestors, or gods of a particular community. The philosophical practice submits statements to the contestation and judgment of anyone endowed with insight&#8230; This discursive practice entails practical and political projects that oppose silencing groups of people, manufacturing consent, oppression, and exploitation. </em></p>
<p>He died on May 8th, 2025.</p>
