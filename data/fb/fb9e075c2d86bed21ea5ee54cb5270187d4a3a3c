<p>My thanks to Intego for sponsoring Six Colors this week with <a href="https://offer.intego.com/sixcolorsWM_glde1m4ol">Mac Washing Machine X9</a>.</p>
<p>You know the drill: spring cleaning. It’s a useful concept to force you to do the necessary tasks you would otherwise put off, and it goes for your digital live as well. Intego is the macOS security leader and <a href="https://offer.intego.com/sixcolorsWM_glde1m4ol">Mac Washing Machine X9</a> helps you easily delete unnecessary files, identify and remove duplicates, and intelligently organize your folders.</p>
<p>Currently, Mac Washing Machine X9 is available for only <a href="https://offer.intego.com/sixcolorsWM_glde1m4ol">$19.99</a> (1 Mac) instead of $49.99, just in time for your own spring cleaning.</p>
<p>Mac Washing Machine X9 identifies and automatically deletes duplicate files, freeing up space, and removes junk files from your disk. But throwing things out isn’t the be-all, end-all of spring cleaning: organization matters too. Mac Washing Machine X9 can automatically sort your documents and even lets you organize your Dock or other app launchers by showing which apps you use the most.</p>
<p>Intego is also offering a bundle, the Intego Mac Premium Bundle X9, which includes Washing Machine, the VirusBarrier antivirus app, a firewall, a VPN, a backup solution, and parental controls, starting <a href="https://offer.intego.com/SixcolorsMACAV_44u3kbx9a">at just $39.99.</a></p>
