&zwnj;watchOS 26&zwnj; public beta 4 can downloaded through the Apple Watch app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> after you sign up on <a href="https://beta.apple.com">Apple's beta website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Blood oxygen sensing has been disabled on Apple's latest U.S. Apple Watch models since January 2024 due to a legal issue, but Apple was able to bring the feature back by tweaking how it works. Apple Watches that previously did not support blood oxygen sensing can once again take readings, but all calculations and results are viewable on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously reintroduced blood oxygen sensing for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a> users, and it was made available for developers with &zwnj;watchOS 26&zwnj; yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch models sold before January 2024 and outside of the U.S. have always had a functional blood oxygen sensing feature and the original blood oxygen app. Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 users will now need to open the Health app and go to the Respiratory section to view their blood oxygen results.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;watchOS 26&zwnj; update brings additional features, such Workout Buddy, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> feature meant to motivate you during your workouts. The Workout app interface has been redesigned, the Smart Stack has more actionable suggestions, the Messages app offer Live Translation and better Smart Replies, and the Phone app features like Call Screening and Hold Assist are available on the watch. Apple also brought the Notes app to the Apple Watch, so you can create notes and view existing notes right from your wrist.<br/>
