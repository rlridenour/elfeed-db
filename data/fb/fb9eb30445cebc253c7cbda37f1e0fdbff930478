Samsung is planning to follow Apple in adding a variable aperture to its smartphone cameras, Korea's <a href="https://www.etnews.com/20260209000238"><em>ET News</em></a> reports. <br/>

A variable aperture allows the camera to adjust the amount of light that reaches the sensor. This means that in dark environments, the aperture can be opened to receive more light, while in light environments, it can be closed to prevent over-exposure. It also should provide users with greater control over depth of field, which refers to how sharp a subject appears in the foreground compared to the background.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro Max are now widely expected to feature an upgraded main camera with a variable aperture. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/23/iphone-18-pro-rumored-camera-upgrade/">December 2024</a>, Apple supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> was first to say that that the main rear camera on both &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models will offer variable aperture. A more recent report from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/15/iphone-18-pros-major-camera-upgrade/">October 2025</a> said Apple was moving ahead with plans to bring the technology to next-generation iPhones and was discussing components with suppliers. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has never used a variable aperture on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> camera before. The main cameras on all of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14 Pro through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> models have a fixed aperture of ƒ/1.78, and the lens is always fully open and shooting with this aperture. Samsung Electronics previously brought a variable aperture camera to its Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S10 models in 2018 and 2019, but due to increased thickness and high price, it dropped the feature in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
In light of Apple's plans, Samsung has reportedly asked multiple camera module partners to develop variable apertures and provide samples. The feature is in early development and final installation has not yet been confirmed, but there is said to be a "strong will" to introduce it.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung apparently sees adding a variable aperture as "necessary to increase camera competitiveness," replacing software correction with physical hardware. The company hopes that in investing in variable aperture camera technology, thickness can be reduced and costs will reduce over time. Apple's first variable aperture camera is expected to arrive in the &zwnj;iPhone 18&zwnj; Pro models in the fall.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/etnews-com/">ETNews</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/samsung-planning-variable-aperture-camera/">Samsung Planning to Follow iPhone 18 Pro&#039;s Variable Aperture Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-planning-to-follow-iphone-18-pros-variable-aperture-camera.2477415/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
