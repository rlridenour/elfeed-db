<h3 id="you-cant-outsource-your-thinking-but">You can’t outsource your thinking, but…</h3>
<p><span class="small-caps">PKM</span>, or Personal Knowledge Management, is the practice of organising the things your brain finds important, including what you are learning, thinking, and being inspired by. The aim is to be able to refer to them as needed, and also to forge links between notes that spark new thoughts, solve problems, and perhaps create things you haven’t yet imagined were possible.</p>
<p>But before diving into all or part of someone else’s system, there’s a vital step to take:</p>
<p><strong>Write down what you’re looking for, what you want to do with the things you write, the notes you make, and what is missing from the way you’re doing things now.</strong></p>
<p>Dig deep and be honest in your responses to those questions.</p>
<p>You might be looking for—</p>
<ul>
<li>A way to find things that keep getting lost</li>
<li>A way to link your thoughts into new ideas</li>
<li>Novelty, because shiny new things are exciting (<span class="small-caps">⚠️</span> <a href="https://ellanew.com/2020-08-26-i-was-a-task-management-app-addict">careful with this one</a>)</li>
<li>Tips on how to use a specific app</li>
<li>A sense of finally being organised</li>
</ul>
<p>—or something else entirely. No matter how great someone else’s system looks, you’ll lose your way if you don’t first understand why you’re drawn to improving your personal knowledge management skills.</p>
<p>Here’s a great little poem from Dr Stefan T. Siegel, an education researcher and lecturer, and self-proclaimed <span class="small-caps">PKM</span> nerd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can’t install a mind that’s wise,<br>
No template sees through your own eyes.<br>
True <span class="small-caps">PKM</span> is built, not bought—<br>
It grows with every well-linked thought. <a href="https://bildung.social/@StefanTSiegel/114539313107437495" target="_blank">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stefan is spot-on when he says that<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span><a href="https://notelab.hypotheses.org/2811" target="_blank"><span class="small-caps">PKM</span> is a Practice, Not a Product: You Can Buy a<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>Done-for-You’ System—But You Can’t Buy the Thinking</a>”</p>
<h3 id="other-peoples-systems-can-help-you-refine-your-own">…other people’s systems can help you refine your own</h3>
<p>My take is that once you know what it is you are seeking, diving into someone else’s system can be a great way to learn things you may not otherwise have considered.</p>
<p>I loved exploring <a href="https://stephango.com/vault" target="_blank">Kepano’s Obsidian vault</a>, and have learned useful things from Sébastien Dubois, Nick Milo, Nicole van der Hoeven, and Mike Schmitz’ free content.</p>
<p>My own <a href="https://miscellaneplans.gumroad.com" target="_blank">downloadable Obsidian vault</a> will be updated some time this year to reflect how I’ve simplified my processes.</p>
<p>Raw beginners with no clue where to start can benefit from seeing a working system in action, and all going well, will learn how to shape it to fit their growing needs. Or step away from that prefab condo in the city to build their own shack by the beach.</p>
<p>Those more experienced in knowledge management can hone their approach by seeing how other people do things.</p>
<p>Remember that dirt floors are fine when you’re starting out. Tiles and hardwood floors can come later.</p>
