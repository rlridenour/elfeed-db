<p>Eric Slivka, reporting last night for MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the Camera app redesign didn’t exactly match what Apple
unveiled for iOS 26, the general idea was correct and much of
what else Prosser showed was pretty close to spot on, and Apple
clearly took notice as the company filed a lawsuit today (<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889709146/Apple-v-Ramacciotti-and-Prosser">Scribd
link</a>) against Prosser and Michael Ramacciotti for
misappropriation of trade secrets.</p>

<p>Apple’s complaint outlines what it claims is the series of events
that led to the leaks, which centered around a development iPhone
in the possession of Ramacciotti’s friend and Apple employee Ethan
Lipnik. According to Apple, Prosser and Ramacciotti plotted to
access Lipnik’s phone, acquiring his passcode and then using
location-tracking to determine when he “would be gone for an
extended period.” Prosser reportedly offered financial
compensation to Ramacciotti in return for assisting with accessing
the development iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lipnik, the Apple employee, was fired, but isn’t named in the lawsuit because seemingly all he did was improperly secure his device running an early build of iOS 26. That’s against company policy, but not against the law.</p>

<p>Prosser, on X, <a href="https://x.com/jon_prosser/status/1946056858474525097">disputes the description of his involvement in Apple’s lawsuit</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the record: This is not how the situation played out on my
end. Luckily have receipts for that.</p>

<p>I did not “plot” to access anyone’s phone. I did not have any
passwords. I was unaware of how the information was obtained.</p>

<p>Looking forward to speaking with Apple on this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prosser also shared <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/07/prosser-signal-screenshot.jpeg">one screenshot</a> of his Signal message correspondence with Ramacciotti.</p>
