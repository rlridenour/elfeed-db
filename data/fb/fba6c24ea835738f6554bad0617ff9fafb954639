  <p>Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is <a href="https://archive.ph/o/v4RcV/https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/">being used</a> to flood X with
<a href="https://archive.ph/o/v4RcV/https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-pushing-ai-undressing-mainstream/">thousands</a> of sexualized images of adults and apparent
minors wearing minimal clothing. Some of this content appears to
not only violate X’s own <a href="https://archive.ph/o/v4RcV/https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules">policies</a>, which prohibit sharing
illegal content such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM), but
may also violate the guidelines of Apple’s App Store and the
Google Play store.</p>

<p>Apple and Google both explicitly ban apps containing CSAM, which
is illegal to host and distribute in many countries. The tech
giants also forbid apps that contain pornographic material or
facilitate harassment. The Apple App Store <a href="https://archive.ph/o/v4RcV/https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">says</a> it doesn’t
allow “overtly sexual or pornographic material,” as well as
“defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content,” especially
if the app is “likely to humiliate, intimidate, or harm a targeted
individual or group.” The Google Play store <a href="https://archive.ph/o/v4RcV/https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9878810?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=9877466&amp;sjid=1253303111790657994-NC">bans</a> apps that
“contain or promote content associated with sexually predatory
behavior, or distribute non-consensual sexual content,” and well
as programs that “contain or facilitate threats, harassment, or
bullying.”</p>

<p>Over the past two years, Apple and Google removed a number of
“nudify” and AI image-generation apps after <a href="https://archive.ph/o/v4RcV/https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cx205lnplpwo">investigations</a>
by the BBC and 404 Media found <a href="https://archive.ph/o/v4RcV/https://www.404media.co/instagram-advertises-nonconsensual-ai-nude-apps/">they were being advertised</a>
or used to effectively turn ordinary photos into explicit images
of women without their consent.</p>

<p>But at the time of publication, both the X app and the <a href="https://archive.ph/o/v4RcV/https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-generating-sexual-content-far-more-graphic-than-whats-on-x/">standalone
Grok app</a> remain available in both app stores. Apple, Google,
and X did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>I just browsed through the last five minutes of replies generated by Grok on Twitter/X, and saw both seeming CSAM (all young Asian women) and just outright hardcore pornographic video (that, for what it’s worth, seemed to feature adults, whether real or generated).</p>

<p>It was a barely concealed secret <em>before</em> Musk bought Twitter that Twitter had an active dark underbelly of pornographic content. But you had to know where to look for it. It really wasn’t something you might just stumble upon. Now you get hardcore porno just by looking at the profile page for Grok. And any user can send any photo they want to @grok and tell it to change or remove the subject’s clothing and change their pose. Lord only knows what people are generating privately using the standalone Grok app.</p>

<p>If a new social network app launched featuring this content, it surely would be removed from the App Store and Play Store. X is seemingly untouchable for political reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Recall that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46275138">Apple pulled the Tumblr app from the App Store in 2018</a> for similar content.</p>
