<br/>

<li><strong>Rectangular camera bump:</strong> iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/iphone-17-pro-no-two-tone-rear-design/">large rectangular camera bump</a> with rounded corners. Apple apparently plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/iphone-17-pro-to-stick-with-triangular-camera/">stick with a triangular arrangement</a> for the rear camera lenses.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Sky Blue finish:</strong> Like the latest MacBook Air, the iPhone 17 Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/iphone-17-pro-sky-blue-color/">rumored to be available in a Sky Blue color</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Larger battery:</strong> The iPhone 17 Pro Max is rumored to have a slightly thicker design that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-pro-max-thicker-larger-battery/">allows for a larger battery</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>A19 Pro chip:</strong> iPhone 17 Pro models are expected to use Apple's next-generation A19 Pro chip, which will reportedly be manufactured <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/a19-and-a19-pro-n3p-rumor/">with TSMC's newer third-generation 3nm process</a>. Like usual, expect modest year-over-year performance gains and power efficiency improvements compared to the current iPhones.</li><br/>

<li><strong>24-megapixel front camera:</strong> All four iPhone 17 models are said to feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/">upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera</a>, whereas all iPhone 16 models are equipped with a 12-megapixel front-facing camera.</li><br/>
<li><strong>48-megapixel rear Telephoto camera:</strong> An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/">upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto camera</a> is rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-pro-rumored-features/">for the iPhone 17 Pro models</a>, up from the 12-megapixel Telephoto camera on iPhone 16 Pro models.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Dual video recording:</strong> According to Jon Prosser, of the YouTube channel Front Page Tech, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will allow users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/iphone-17-pro-dual-video-recording-rumor/">record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously</a> in the Camera app.</li><br/>

<li><strong>12GB of RAM:</strong> iPhone 17 Pro models, and even the iPhone 17 Air, are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-12gb-ram-rumor/">rumored to have 12GB of RAM</a>.
