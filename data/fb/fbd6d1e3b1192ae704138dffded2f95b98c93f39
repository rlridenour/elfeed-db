<p>Warren Buffett’s annual shareholders letters are always a must-read. The honesty, clarity, and striking humility of his prose stands out in a world where corporate communications — from companies of any size — tend to be bland and obfuscating. <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2024ltr.pdf">This year’s letter</a>, published back in February, is no exception. Two sections stood out to me. First, in a section titled “Mistakes — Yes, We Make Them at Berkshire”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes I’ve made mistakes in assessing the future economics of
a business I’ve purchased for Berkshire — each a case of capital
allocation gone wrong. That happens with both judgments about
marketable equities — we view these as <em>partial</em> ownership of
businesses — and the 100% acquisitions of companies.</p>

<p>At other times, I’ve made mistakes when assessing the abilities or
fidelity of the managers Berkshire is hiring. The fidelity
disappointments can hurt beyond their financial impact, a pain
that can approach that of a failed marriage.</p>

<p>A decent batting average in personnel decisions is all that can be
hoped for. The cardinal sin is delaying the correction of mistakes
or what Charlie Munger called “thumb-sucking.” Problems, he would
tell me, cannot be wished away. They require action, however
uncomfortable that may be.</p>

<p>During the 2019-23 period, I have used the words “mistake” or
“error” 16 times in my letters to you. Many other huge companies
have <em>never</em> used either word over that span. Amazon, I should
acknowledge, made some brutally candid observations in its 2021
letter. Elsewhere, it has generally been happy talk and pictures.</p>

<p>I have also been a director of large public companies at which
“mistake” or “wrong” were forbidden words at board meetings or
analyst calls. That taboo, implying managerial perfection, always
made me nervous (though, at times, there could be legal issues
that make limited discussion advisable. We live in a very
litigious society.)</p>

<p>At 94, it won’t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and
will be writing the annual letters. Greg shares the Berkshire
creed that a “report” is what a Berkshire CEO annually owes to
owners. And he also understands that if you start fooling your
shareholders, you will soon believe your own baloney and be
fooling yourself as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the great physicist Richard Feynman said, “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”</p>

<p>Second is an entire section, not complaining, but instead proudly declaring, that last year Berkshire set the record for the highest single-year corporate income tax payment in United States history:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Huge numbers can be hard to visualize. Let me recast the $26.8
billion that we paid last year.</p>

<p>If Berkshire had sent the Treasury a $1 million check every 20
minutes throughout all of 2024 — visualize <em>366 days and nights</em>
because 2024 was a leap year — we still would have owed the
federal government a significant sum at yearend. Indeed, it would
be well into January before the Treasury would tell us that we
could take a short breather, get some sleep, and prepare for our
2025 tax payments. [...]</p>

<p>Berkshire’s activities now impact all corners of our country. And
we are not finished. Companies die for many reasons but, unlike
the fate of humans, old age itself is not lethal. Berkshire today
is far more youthful than it was in 1965.</p>

<p><em>However</em>, as Charlie and I have always acknowledged, Berkshire
would not have achieved its results in any locale except America
whereas America would have been every bit the success it has been
if Berkshire had never existed.</p>

<p>So thank you, Uncle Sam. Someday your nieces and nephews at
Berkshire hope to send you even larger payments than we did in
2024. Spend it wisely. Take care of the many who, for no fault of
their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better. And
never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and
that result <em>requires</em> both wisdom and vigilance on your part.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, that was written back in February. Prescient as always.</p>
