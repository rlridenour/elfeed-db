         <p>In this new video series, I talk to anybody who is interested to have
a video call with me (so do contact me if you want!). The topics cover
anything related to Emacs, technology, and life in general. More here:

<p>In this video I talk with Ronnie Nissan about a range of issues
covering free software and everyday life issues. Ronnie is a GTK
(Gnome) app developer, who also has experience with GNU Emacs. We
explore the intersection of social organisation and modern technology,
such as how people’s behavioural patterns are affected and what kind
of power dynamics are at play. Through our exchange we discuss matters
of parenting, or what I called “upbringing” (it involves more than
just the parents), education, and culture at-large. In the process, I
learn about life in Iraqi Kurdistan, while also noticing how many of
the typical personal and collective problems we are aware of are
common across cultures.</p>
