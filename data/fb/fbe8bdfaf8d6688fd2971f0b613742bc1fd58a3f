  <p>Apple might be preparing iPad apps for Pixelmator Pro, Compressor,
Motion, and MainStage, according to new App Store IDs uncovered by
MacRumors contributor Aaron Perris. All four of the apps are
currently available on the Mac only. A quick overview of each app:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator-pro/id1289583905?mt=12">Pixelmator Pro</a>: Professional image editing app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-completes-pixelmator-acquisition/">acquired
by Apple</a> earlier this year</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/compressor/id424390742?mt=12">Compressor</a>: Final Cut Pro companion app for compressing
audio and video files</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motion/id434290957?mt=12">Motion</a>: Final Cut Pro companion app for creating 2D/3D
titles, transitions, and effects</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mainstage/id634159523?mt=12">MainStage</a>: Logic Pro companion app for live performances</li>
</ul>

<p>There is already a less-capable <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id924695435">Pixelmator</a> app available
for the iPad and iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting though that — just like Final Cut and Logic — these new pro apps are reportedly iPad-only, with no support for iPhone.</p>

<p>Also: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/115447184072770472">still no Xcode</a>, even for iPad.</p>
