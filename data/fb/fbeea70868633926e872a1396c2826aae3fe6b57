<p>William Foege, William Roper, David Satcher, Jeffrey Koplan, Richard Besser, Tom Frieden, Anne Schuchat, Rochelle P. Walensky, and Mandy K. Cohen — all of them former directors of the CDC, under every president from Jimmy Carter to Trump — in a co-bylined op-ed for the NYT:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What the health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy
Jr., has done to the C.D.C. and to our nation’s public health
system over the past several months — culminating in his decision
to fire Dr. Susan Monarez as C.D.C. director days ago — is unlike
anything we had ever seen at the agency and unlike anything our
country had ever experienced.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennedy has fired thousands of federal health workers and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/health/cdc-layoffs-kennedy.html">severely weakened</a> programs designed to protect Americans
from cancer, heart attacks, strokes, lead poisoning, injury,
violence and more. Amid the largest measles outbreak in the United
States in a generation, he’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/health/measles-treatments-vaccines-kennedy.html">focused on</a> unproven
treatments while downplaying vaccines. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/health/rfk-jr-vaccine-funding.html">canceled</a>
investments in promising medical research that will leave us ill
prepared for future health emergencies. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/well/vaccines-cdc-rfk-jr.html">replaced</a>
experts on federal health advisory committees with unqualified
individuals who share his dangerous and unscientific views. He
announced the end of U.S. support for global vaccination programs
that protect millions of children and keep Americans safe,
<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/02/rfk-jr-vaccines-former-cdc-director-tom-frieden-says-kennedy-mangled-science-in-gavi-decision/">citing</a> flawed research and making inaccurate statements.
And he <a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1940089073391018352">championed</a> federal legislation that will cause
millions of people with health insurance through Medicaid to
<a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/Wyden-Pallone-Neal_Letter_6-4-25.pdf">lose</a> their coverage. Firing Dr. Monarez — which led to
the resignations of top C.D.C. officials — adds considerable fuel
to this raging fire. [...]</p>

<p>This is unacceptable, and it should alarm every American,
regardless of political leanings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s good that they’re speaking up, but it’s too mealy-mouthed. What’s going on at HHS under Kennedy isn’t merely “unacceptable” and “alarming”. It’s outrageous and shocking.</p>
