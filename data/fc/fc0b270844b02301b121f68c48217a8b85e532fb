After years of a languishing example of The Cobbler&rsquo;s Children , I finally got around to renovating my own website: toryanderson.com. Admittedly I have a lot to learn about visual design, but I had a good time on the technical front. I took the opportunity to use technologies I love and have been pleased with the result – both in the product and the cost constraints. In other words, it was fun to build and cheap to host: Clojure[script] meets shared hosting.
