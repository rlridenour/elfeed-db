Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max models will feature a number of significant display, thermal, and battery improvements, according to new late-stage rumors.<br/>

According to the Weibo leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>," the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; models will feature displays with higher brightness, making it more suitable for use in direct sunlight for prolonged periods. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max have a typical maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, but can boost to a peak of 2,000 nits for a brief period when outdoors. <br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the frame rate of intense games will be more stable thanks to the device's redesigned thermal architecture. Frame-drops and lag will occur much less frequently. Similarly, performance when shooting 4K video at 60 frames-per-second in warm outdoor conditions, such as under direct sunlight in the summer, will be improved.<br/>
<br/>
The two devices are apparently set to become the longest-battery life iPhones to date, thanks to both increased capacity and improved efficiency across the device. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/03/iphone-17-pro-max-battery-capacity-leaked/">Previous rumors</a> suggested that the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Pro&zwnj; Max could have a battery over 5,000 mAh in capacity.<br/>
