<p>Hong Kong is holding elections for its Legislative Council under a system that allows only candidates vetted as &quot;patriots&quot; to run, in the second such poll since Beijing overhauled the city’s electoral rules in 2021 to ensure greater control from the central government. The vote comes days after a residential tower blaze in the Wang Fuk Court complex killed more than 150 people, making it the territory’s deadliest fire in decades and triggering widespread grief and public anger over building safety and official accountability. Authorities have mounted an unusually intensive campaign to encourage participation, with Chief Executive John Lee urging residents to cast ballots and arguing that higher turnout would demonstrate support for the new political order. Many analysts and officials quoted in the coverage, however, expect participation to be lower than in past competitive elections, as some residents express disillusionment with the limited choice of candidates and focus instead on demanding a thorough investigation of the fire.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/wsIdOel0nJNn0Oo69AUS_7gShkBkZiceUWtoT84IZKC0Wn7HRiWELFV5whGY_pz-oqh0N0CeEpeO0jFY6QB_wyd_BxXXjFBosC6N5aaUlA0b_MIPLRyMbyhEoqdOvJfHmvQmXKrn1hZ9EVn3OYloLKhahrCxmyEvIq3B5DbxJ_e0bAomZ9EMnJAWpTOUDceVAJ-Dvpw559EwQKVm1pkFvSEdW-y462QWNtCIIqoUMknrddZ48NTxSwo3pkHX' alt='Voters queue outside a polling station in Hong Kong during the Legislative Council election.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Patriots-only rules: Under the current electoral model, a government-led vetting committee screens all would‑be candidates for their political loyalty, a process authorities say is designed to exclude figures they label &quot;anti‑China&quot; or insufficiently patriotic.</li><li>Changed council makeup: Reforms introduced after 2020 sharply reduced the number of directly elected Legislative Council seats and expanded those chosen by pro-establishment committees and interest groups, consolidating the influence of Beijing-aligned blocs inside the chamber.</li><li>Government turnout push: Officials promoted the election with citywide advertising, free public transport offers and public appeals by senior leaders who framed voting as a civic duty in support of stability and prosperity.</li><li>Public safety concerns: The recent fire has intensified scrutiny of fire exits, stairwell design and emergency access in older residential buildings, as residents and victims’ families press for clearer safety rules and stronger enforcement.</li><li>Opposition landscape: Most well-known pro-democracy politicians are either in jail, in exile or barred from standing under the new vetting arrangements, leaving the ballot dominated by candidates who publicly endorse the post‑2021 political framework.</li></ul><blockquote>Voting is our civic responsibility - John Lee</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Hong Kong government: Officials describe the revamped system and the current election as a way to ensure that only those who &quot;love the country and love Hong Kong&quot; shape policy, which they say will bring long-term stability and better governance.
