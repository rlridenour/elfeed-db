<p>On Youtube, jazz enthusiast Jonathan Holmes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-Y9NcqUHY4">declares</a>: “I can guarantee this is the cleanest sounding Louis Armstrong record you’ll ever hear! With the original transfer supplied by <a href="http://www.vjm.biz/newpage8.htm">Nick Dellow</a>, here is the mother record which was shipped by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okeh_Records">Okeh</a> to Germany for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeon_Records">Odeon pressings</a>. The sound is wonderfully immediate, and crystal clear.” No crackle and pop. That’s how Holmes&nbsp;describes the pristine recording you can hear above of the Louis Armstrong classic, “Ain’t Misbehavin’.” Below, hear another “mother metal” recording of another Armstrong song, “Knee Drops.” Enjoy the&nbsp;early Satchmo in all of its wonderful clarity.</p>
