Following signs of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ios-26-2-iphone-users-eu-siri-replacement/">new Side Button functionality</a> in the iOS 26.2 beta 3 update, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/launching-your-voice-based-conversational-app-from-the-side-button-of-iphone">Apple developer documentation</a> has confirmed that assigning a third-party voice assistant to the Side Button will be a feature available to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in Japan.<br/>

Developers are able to set up an App Intents framework that will allow voice-based conversational apps to be launched directly from the Side Button in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, a long press on the Side Button activates <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, and there is no option to change that. Japanese &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users will soon be able to select a new default, opting to activate Alexa, Gemini, or another voice assistant instead. App developers will need to expressly adopt this functionality for Side Button access to be available to consumers.<br/>
<br/>
From Apple's developer documentation:<blockquote>In Japan, people might place an action on the side button of iPhone that instantly launches your voice-based conversational app. People expect the voice-based conversational functionality to be instantly available when they launch your app with the side button, so make sure to let them immediately use it by starting an audio session - for example, with AVFoundation.</blockquote><br/>
Apple makes it clear that the option to activate a third-party personal assistant using App Intents will only be available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in Japan, not in other countries. To use the feature, the country or region of an Apple Account must be set to Japan and a user must be located in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 26.2 also adds support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/ios-26-2-third-party-app-stores-japan/">third-party App Stores</a> and provides a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/05/japan-safari-choice-ios-26-2/">Safari Search Engine choice screen</a> during setup in Japan. With these features, Apple is complying with Mobile Software Competition Act Guidelines established by the Japan Fair Trade Commission.<br/>

When we initially shared details of the Side Button code, it looked like it might be available to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in the European Union under the Digital Markets Act. It's possible that might still happen eventually, but it's clear that the initial implementation will be limited to Japan.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/11/17/ios-26-2-iphone-users-japan-siri/">iOS 26.2 Lets iPhone Users in Japan Replace Siri With Third-Party Assistants on Side Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-2-lets-iphone-users-in-japan-replace-siri-with-third-party-assistants-on-side-button.2471365/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
