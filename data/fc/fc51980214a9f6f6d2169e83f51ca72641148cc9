<p>Today we’re launching a new look for your inbox, in both our webmail and mobile apps. Familiar but refined, the message list is now cleaner and more focused. Avatars help quickly identify who’s in the conversation, and one-click hover actions let you easily archive or delete.</p><p>Make it yours with easier customisation, with live updates as you try out different options. Don’t have a Fastmail account yet? Here’s what you’re missing:</p><p><video class="aspect-video relative rounded-lg shadow-card z-50" autoplay loop playsinline muted controls width="1280" height="720"> <source src="/assets/blog/2025-04-28-revamped-inbox/NewLook.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=vp9,vorbis"> <source src="/assets/blog/2025-04-28-revamped-inbox/NewLook.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video></p><h2 id="and-more" tabindex="-1">And more</h2><p>We’ve also focused on fixing the niggling small things. We’ve improved support for using a mouse or pencil in our iPad app. Made it easier to quickly create a contact or event while reading a message. Added an option to stop messages from being automatically marked as read when you open them. We’ve even moved the “report phishing” action to be next to “report spam”. Finally.</p><p>On mobile you can also now choose what apps are shown in the mobile navigation bar at the bottom (or turn them all off to hide it). Missing your quick hover actions? Configure up to four custom swipe actions to fly through your mail on the go. To select a message, just press and hold, or swipe with two fingers.</p><p>We hope you enjoy the new look.
