As you probably know, we here at Irreal take a dim view of Management meddling in the inner workings of Engineering. That is not at all the same as taking a dim view of Management: they are an important and necessary part of any business but their expertise does not, usually, extend to the best way of running an engineering department. A good rule, it seems to me, is that if you don&rsquo;t have an engineering background, leave the running of Engineering to those who do.

That brings us to the poster child for this problem: Boeing Aircraft. Boeing once exemplified the perfect company involved in engineering. For a long time they defined the aircraft manufacturing industry. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?s=boeing">written a lot about Boeing and its problems</a> but all those posts can&rsquo;t begin to capture how profoundly sick the company is.

Now the National Transportation Safety Board has <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA24MA063.aspx">weighed in on the in flight separation of a door plug on a Boeing 737</a>. Read their recommendations. It seems like a list of things that any responsible company would do before shipping a product that people depended on not to kill them. As the NTSB makes clear, this incident was a <i>Management</i> failure both on the part of Boeing and the FAA.

I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of lessons that can be drawn from all this but mine is simply this: When managers without engineering expertise start meddling in Engineering, you can be sure that it&rsquo;s going to end in tears.</p>
