<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today shared some details about future devices.<br/>

In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-30/apple-readies-biggest-push-into-health-yet-with-revamped-app-ai-doctor-service-m8vl97k2"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>, Gurman said that Apple is already in the early stages of developing iPad Pro models with an M6 chip and an Apple-designed 5G modem, an entry-level iPad 12 with a newer chip, and MacBook Air models with an M5 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is currently aiming to release the iPad Pro models with its own 5G modem in 2027, according to Gurman. This will likely be Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-18-pro-c2-modem-rumor/">C2 modem</a>. The current cellular iPad Pro models are equipped with Qualcomm modems.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's first C1 modem <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/">debuted in the iPhone 16e</a> last month.<br/>
<br/>
A new iPad Pro generation typically launches every 18 months or so. The current models were released in May 2024, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/30/m5-ipad-pro-macbook-pro-later-this-year/">next models with the M5 chip will likely launch in October</a> this year. If this trend continues, the iPad Pro models with the M6 chip and an Apple-designed 5G modem would likely be released in the first half of 2027.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman did not say when the new entry-level iPad and MacBook Air models will launch, but 2026 is a safe bet.<br/>
<br/>
