<p>The Guardian:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There on a plinth, with “Donald J Trump” emblazoned on it in
capital letters, was the uncoveted trophy: a golden globe resting
on five golden hands big enough to compensate any tiny-handed
recipient feeling sore about the Nobel peace prize.</p>

<p>But wait, there was more. “There is also a beautiful medal for you
that you can wear everywhere you want to go,” added Infantino,
knowing that with Trump there is no such thing as too much.</p>

<p>Glowing oranger than usual under the stage lights, Trump eagerly
put the medal around his neck without waiting for Infantino to do
the honours. He told the audience of 2,000 people: “This is truly
one of the great honours of my life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s just perfect that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/09/donald-trump-finally-won-peace-prize-fifa-five-other-awards-he-should-win">Trump put the medal around his own neck</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/arts/television/late-night-trump-prize.html">The jokes</a> practically wrote themselves.</p>
