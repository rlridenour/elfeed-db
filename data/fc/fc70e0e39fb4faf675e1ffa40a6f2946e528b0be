<h3 id="the-johnny-decimal-task-management-course-has-changed-everything">The Johnny Decimal Task Management Course has changed everything</h3>
<p>Johnny Decimal (<span class="small-caps">JD</span>) has been generously sharing his <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com" target="_blank">system</a> for organising static information online, for free, for about a decade. I’ve been a fan for several years, trying with varying degrees of success to organise my stuff with it.</p>
<p>Well, the system has finally come of age. Everything you need to fine tune <span class="small-caps">JD</span> to your specific situation, including the new Task and Project Management course (<span class="small-caps">JDTPM</span>), is available in the Johnny Decimal University (<span class="small-caps">JDU</span>). It’s <a href="https://jdhq.johnnydecimal.com/sign-up/?product=jdu" target="_blank">200 <span class="small-caps">USD</span></a>, which represents incredible value when you look at <a href="https://jdhq.johnnydecimal.com/sign-up/?product=jdu" target="_blank">what’s included</a>. I can’t praise these resources highly enough!</p>
<p>Even though I’ve only (fairly quickly) gone through the course once, what I’ve picked up so far already has me thinking about my tasks differently. <em>Good</em> differently.</p>
<p><em><span class="small-caps">FYI</span> I’m a long-time paying <span class="small-caps">JD</span> customer, not a shill. I don’t endorse anything I don’t love. All words and opinions are my own. Johnny doesn’t know I’m writing this.</em></p>
<h3 id="the-course-principles-also-apply-to-a-plain-text-system">The course principles also apply to a plain text system</h3>
<p>This isn’t meant to be a comprehensive review, so I’ll just ramble a bit about what has stood out to me.</p>
<p>I love that Johnny is speaking in a relaxed, conversational tone rather reading a script. There are no lecture-vibes here — it’s like sitting with a well-credentialed friend as they show you how they do things.</p>
<p>Everything is explained in detail both verbally and with on-screen examples. He speaks slowly enough to catch everything at normal speed, and clearly enough that 1.5x works well for revisiting already viewed material.</p>
<p>Johnny explains priorities (<span class="small-caps">P1</span> through <span class="small-caps">P4</span>) in a way I’ve never heard before. It makes perfect sense, and is already helping me have a calmer view of what’s on my plate. I love that you don’t actually have to tag anything <span class="small-caps">P1</span>, <span class="small-caps">P2</span>, <span class="small-caps">P3</span>, or <span class="small-caps">P4</span>. Once you understand how they work, it’s easy to spot which one applies to any given task.</p>
<p>Seeing how to integrate tasks with my Johnny Decimal system is the real game changer, and, for me, the missing piece in designing a plugin-free plain text task system. I was using Johnny Decimal before, but rather messily. This course has deepened my understanding of how to apply <span class="small-caps">JD</span> principles to my own situation.</p>
<p>Even though this course is focused on how to use the Mac app <em>Things</em>, the system can be used in many, if not most, other task management apps. In fact, everything he’s described so far can be done to my satisfaction with good old plain text.</p>
<p>I’m rather excited about how well it is coming together in Obsidian, and dovetailing with my Markdown calendar! Of course there are compromises with functionality and convenience when compared with Things, but mine is still a highly capable and <em>trustable</em> system for seeing what I need to see, when I need to see it. <em>(See below for a warning against doing this)</em></p>
<p>I plan to continue using Carl Pullein’s time sectors to manage tasks and time, though no doubt the way I use them will continue to evolve.</p>
<h3 id="on-being-tidy">On being tidy</h3>
<p>When we need to focus on a particular window on our computers, Johnny advises us to</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Tidy up. Don’t just live in this world of windows.” —<em>Finalising your start-the-day routine, 5:12</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A big yes to this! Keeping my digital workspace clean has become a vital habit: everything else needs to be hidden so I can focus on the task at hand. My desktop truly is a blank slate. And much to the bemusement of people peering over my shoulder at that entirely empty space, the dock is permanently hidden. This works for me, you may not need to go that far.</p>
<h3 id="dont-keep-your-tasks-in-a-notes-app-unless">Don’t keep your tasks in a notes app! Unless…</h3>
<p>Here’s another quote from the <span class="small-caps">JDTPM</span> course I heartily agree with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I realised that having tasks in two places, even briefly, was a terrible idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trying to maintain too many inboxes will always lead to confusion, which is why I’m keeping everything where Obsidian can see it. Tasks, calendar, notes — everything. This time last year I’d have laughed or scoffed (or both) at the very idea of that. Not so, now. It’s clear, organised, and has just the right amount of hands-on work required to keep me focused, without being arduous.</p>
<p>You won’t catch Johnny keeping tasks in Obsidian, or any other notes app. He actively and specifically warns against it (“Obsidian is not a task manager. Things is a task manager”), and yet I’m doing it, and doing it successfully!</p>
<p>But please don’t ignore that warning: keeping tasks and calendars in a notes app is going to be a terrible idea for most people. And anyway, the majority who hear about it are probably going to run away screaming!</p>
<p>But for people with brains like mine that simply <em>cannot</em> cope with locking away tasks in a non-portable, proprietary format, plain text tasks (without helps like Vim or Org) can be a valid solution. Feel free to try and change my mind. I don’t think you’ll be able to, but I’m willing to hear you out.</p>
<p>(Yes, I’m aware you can export from Things into Markdown, but notes and dates are dropped in the process.)</p>
<p>You’ll be able to see my plain text task and project management system explained in detail sometime next year. I’m going to take a leaf out of Johnny’s book and wait until I have a good 6 months under my belt before airing it in public.</p>
<h3 id="why-you-cant-just-buy-the-course-on-its-own">Why you can’t just buy the course on its own</h3>
<p>Maybe you’ll wonder why, as I did, the Johnny Decimal Task and Project Management course isn’t available separately, for a lower cost. It’s because it’s excellent value at full price on its own, and because the information in it only makes sense as part of a bigger picture.</p>
<p>Here’s what Johnny has to say about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We create courses that reference each other. I want to be able to tell you something <em>over here</em> and refer you to something <em>over there</em>. This is simpler and more effective for both of us.</p>
<p>I can only do that if you have access to everything we make. So that’s what <span class="small-caps">JDU</span> is: <strong>access to all of our existing learning content, and everything we’ll make in the future</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here’s the <a href="https://jdhq.johnnydecimal.com/sign-up/?product=jdu" target="_blank">link</a> again to learn more about Johnny Decimal University (<span class="small-caps">JDU</span>) where you will find all you’ll ever need to get your digital files supremely organised, no matter how many hats you wear.</p>

<h3 id="early-access-obsidian-ios-widgets">Early Access: Obsidian iOS widgets</h3>
<p>Obsidian widgets have been on my wish list for a good while, so I was delighted to see them announced for early access.</p>
<p>And they’re looking promising! Though I am seeing some teething problems with accessing bookmarked files, with my active vault still not showing up when trying to customise the widget.</p>
<p>Now, as you know, the smallest widget on an iPhone takes up the space of four regular icons. Yes, we can stack widgets and swipe between them, but I prefer direct visual access to my four main files, right from the Home Screen.</p>
<p>For this reason I’m convinced that Shortcuts saved to the home screen will remain the better option for accessing specific Obsidian files, even when the bugs are ironed out of the early release. You can read about this approach in <a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/06/ptpl-176-simple-obsidian-iphone-shortcuts" title="wikilink"><span class="small-caps">PTPL</span> 176</a>.</p>
