<p>UK police are assessing allegations that Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, shared sensitive UK trade information with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The claims rest on reported emails linked to Andrew’s 2010 role as a government trade envoy. Thames Valley Police said it is “assessing” the reports—often an early step before deciding whether to open a formal investigation. Buckingham Palace said King Charles is ready to support police as they review the claims, signaling cooperation from the monarch’s office as scrutiny of Andrew’s past association with Epstein returns to the forefront. In separate statements cited in coverage, the Prince and Princess of Wales said they are “deeply concerned” about revelations emerging from the US investigation into Epstein-related matters.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/ibUJFtEx0jF4EC7x-qLVHuPFnolwL4Rm_fP81L507dIA3nGeu8nfBrFGUwbcuduTta-5-e4OkgOxPYfaltCV6T6O68z7OCT1dTHDhTQ77knPzjdJs7ywxQfDy9X32kYEVY8d9RTpkr4YP-IfkxpGweCGDR4YDPEJM0srNEjyGJ31cRITZ_Wa869Gz1fpSJR_SME_usrM4y1dN4zfpoUMWZedRrOQ4V3HyHZdvUPzXFkhOwqICDSUNpUx8Y0xCtJlp3G4OwEpIspHE24nZILilE2R5_Rj7x3prRSuONZDusvxRkd1s8faI9ytoKdv8CVE43OPuKqpQlfw3K0NjgWHLpR1NQU20EXlZBZ_xqMAeYngaALRGg9dTLiZbk77RttrpklhgVfEbKKWLZS_aX7FvnQDULZRS8jmc7JPH9Fx4I7f6jxPFUqD61EgnbVYfAO_271V7hd-YctqmflQsMApSBdjfzX-ZjE7syDZqKj9aFRTWMGvtXUMkA' alt='A file photo used in coverage of renewed scrutiny of Prince Andrew’s links to Jeffrey Epstein.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>What’s alleged: Reports say the disputed material relates to Andrew’s 2010 work as Britain’s trade envoy, including documents from a Southeast Asia trip and an email chain said to include a November 2010 message sent by his then assistant Amit Patel.</li><li>Police jurisdiction: Thames Valley Police covers an area west of London that includes Windsor, according to coverage.</li><li>Public scrutiny: DW said the renewed Epstein fallout could overshadow Prince William’s visit to Saudi Arabia, showing how the issue can collide with current royal engagements.</li><li>Political ripple: The Globe and Mail reported UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer came under added pressure after a second aide resigned in an Epstein-related scandal.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Buckingham Palace: The palace said King Charles III is ready to support police as they assess the allegations involving Andrew and Epstein.
