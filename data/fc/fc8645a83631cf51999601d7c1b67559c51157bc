<p>Pope Leo XIV concluded a three-day visit to Lebanon on Tuesday with a large open-air Mass on Beirut’s waterfront and a silent prayer at the site of the 2020 port explosion that devastated parts of the capital and killed more than 220 people. The trip, his first abroad since becoming pope in May, focused on encouraging Lebanon’s Christians and wider society after years of economic crisis, political paralysis and conflict, and on urging peace across the Middle East. During the visit he repeatedly called on political and religious leaders to be &quot;builders of peace&quot; and to protect Lebanon’s tradition of coexistence among Christians and Muslims, including at a major interfaith gathering in Martyrs’ Square, once a front line in the civil war. He also met relatives of blast victims, prayed at the tomb of a Lebanese saint revered by both Christians and Muslims, and addressed young people whose trust in their country has been shaken, urging them not to give up on Lebanon’s future.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/bf7szvXMvoKkBn34ZqRNFlFkuJ035UO7QUpaWgv7TxfC5lcw448cV944NiXAdIDGZ54OhsnBo3extNlyexWjTnHHa5EQCNudexO56y78_ylFgPqI2KZt9RWxu_WvF9RgLtaxhBb1sDHp4oI_6Mj2ZsRYVOuVoX6x6h_xdi4SSXZYe8zbqCWupnLsuvjGgdtpjz_cvf5M' alt='Pope Leo XIV holds a silent prayer at the site of the 2020 Beirut port blast.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Huge waterfront turnout: Organisers estimated that roughly 120,000 to 150,000 worshippers gathered along Beirut’s historic waterfront for the Pope’s outdoor Mass, making it the highlight of his Lebanon visit and one of the city’s largest public religious events in recent years.</li><li>Interfaith symbolism: At Martyrs’ Square, the pontiff sat beside the spiritual heads of 16 recognised Muslim and Christian denominations as a children’s choir alternated Christian hymns with Muslim nasheeds under a banner reading “peace” in French and Arabic, underscoring Lebanon’s religious diversity.</li><li>Youth-focused message: Speaking at the Maronite Patriarchate of Bkerké and other encounters, Leo urged young Christians to stay engaged in Lebanese public life rather than emigrating, telling them their role was to help rebuild a more just and peaceful society.</li><li>Visit to shared saint: The Pope stopped at the tomb of a Lebanese saint venerated by both Christians and Muslims, using the occasion to encourage priests and church workers to offer particular hope and accompaniment to young people facing “life’s injustices”.</li><li>Regional conflict backdrop: The visit unfolded as Lebanon continued to feel the aftershocks of a recent war with Israel and amid ongoing Israeli raids in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, adding urgency to the Pope’s appeals for a broader Middle East peace.</li></ul><blockquote>Lebanon is more than a country; it is a message of peace and fraternity that must not be allowed to fade. - Pope Leo XIV</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pope Leo XIV: From Martyrs’ Square, Leo called on religious leaders to be “builders of peace: to confront intolerance, overcome violence and banish exclusion, illuminating the path toward justice and concord”.
