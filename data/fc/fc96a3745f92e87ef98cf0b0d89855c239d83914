</ul><h1>Throwing Shade</h1><p>It’s time to go to the beach!</p>
<p>The sun’s out. The waves are crashing. The atmosphere is delightful. Everywhere you look, you see families, groups of friends, couples laughing at inside jokes. Someone set up a volleyball net and things are getting pretty competitive. Not to mention, did you see that sand castle? It’s a shame you can’t set it in epoxy and preserve it forever, because, damn, it’s a piece of art.</p>
<p>Sounds amazing, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>But on the other hand, consider the situation’s various downsides.</p>
<p>Namely:</p>
<p>The sun’s out and it is BEATING down. The waves are crashing, as in: it’s too choppy to get in the water for a quick cooldown. The atmosphere is slightly hectic. Everywhere you look, it’s people, people, people–shouting, screaming, laughing. And if you can see them, they can see you.</p>
<p>Okay, we’re laying it on even thicker than you should apply your SPF 50, but you get the point, right?</p>
<p>A day at the beach can be awesome. But it can also get pretty hot and pretty overwhelming. You need a shelter, one you can go in when you want to get out of the sun for a minute.</p>
<p>Or, hell, maybe what you need is a bit of quasi-privacy. After all, not everyone can be out in the world, yucking it up with pals for six hours straight without needing a break for a little quiet reading time or a nap.</p>
<p>Point is, if you’re going to the beach, you should get yourself a structure.</p>
<p>Like this one.</p>
<p>You can set it up in just four quick steps, and boom: you’ve got 150 square feet of shade. It’ll protect you from the sun, and it’ll also protect you from the wind. But most of all, it’ll be your little home base for a day of swimming, relaxing, sand-sculpting, or whatever you want to do at the beach.</p>
<p>So get one. It’ll be nice to have.</p>
