<p>Antonio G. Di Benedetto:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of me still can’t believe it, but Lenovo did the thing: it
took a bonkers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/26/23615842/lenovo-rollable-laptop-smartphone-prototype-concept">concept</a> for a laptop with a rollable screen
and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24337633/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-laptop-flexible-oled-price-specs">built the tech</a> into something you can actually own and
use like a normal computer. Except, as conventional as the
<a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkbook/thinkbook-plus/thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-14-16-inch-intel/len101b0056">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6</a> can be, it’s far from a normal
computer. It’s a $3,300 laptop with a screen that expands from 14
inches to 16.7 inches at the push of a button.</p>

<p>Oh, and it’s actually good. Not just good, but <em>very</em> good. I
still can’t believe it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Di Benedetto, as you can see, is enthusiastic for the laptop. I think it’s a clever idea, but this first instance seems pretty compromised:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As with a foldable phone, you can see some creases and ripples in
the screen’s lower third — the part that rolls up — especially
at oblique angles. If I look closely while working on a
bright-white document, I can sometimes make out a faint shadowy
strip, but I rarely see it, even when staring at that spot. The
motorized screen takes about eight seconds to extend or retract,
and it’s no louder than the fans on an average gaming laptop.
People right near you in a quiet space will hear it, but even
ambient sounds like a TV in the background easily mask the motor.</p>
