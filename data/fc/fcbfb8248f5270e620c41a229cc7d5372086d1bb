<p>New Mac app from Martin Lexow, the developer behind App Ahead (which offers <a href="https://appahead.studio/">a slew of good and intriguing Mac apps</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Preview folder and archive contents (ZIP, RAR, and more) instantly
in macOS Quick Look. Just select a folder and press the Space bar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s just that simple. Install it from the Mac App Store — free of charge — and you can Quick Look inside archives and folders. Looks, feels, and works like a feature that ought to be built into the Finder itself. Cool.</p>
