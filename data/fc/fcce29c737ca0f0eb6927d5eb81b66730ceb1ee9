  This is a big reason why it&rsquo;s a good thing that the European Commission recently gave Apple marching orders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632718/europe-digital-markets-act-apple-interoperability-smartwatches" rel="noopener noreferrer">to open up iOS interoperability</a> to other gadget makers. You can read <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633493/apple-ios-eu-dma-iphone-interoperability-requirements" rel="noopener noreferrer">our explainer</a> on the nitty gritty of what this means, but the gist is that it&rsquo;s going to be harder for Apple to gatekeep iOS features to its own products. Specific to smartwatches, Apple will have to allow third-party smartwatch makers to display and interact with iOS notifications. I&rsquo;m certain Garmin fans worldwide, who have long complained about the inability to send quick replies on iOS, erupted in cheers.

<p id="p5">Can you imagine if your expensive Mac desktop had, <em>say</em>, some latency if you decided to enter text with a non-Apple keyboard? Or if the USB-C port only worked with proprietary Apple accessories? Clearly, those restrictions would be absurd on computers that cost thousands of dollars. And yet, similar restrictions have long existed on iPhones and the iOS ecosystem, and it&rsquo;s time to put an end to them.</p>
