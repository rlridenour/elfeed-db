<p>60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley, in last night’s closing statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Stories we’ve pursued for 57 years are often controversial:
lately, the Israel-Gaza war and the Trump administration. Bill
made sure they were accurate and fair. He was tough that way.”</p>

<p>“But our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a
merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began
to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been
blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest
journalism requires.”</p>

<p>“No one here is happy about it. But in resigning, Bill proved one
thing: He was the right person to lead ‘60 Minutes’ all along.”</p>
</blockquote>
