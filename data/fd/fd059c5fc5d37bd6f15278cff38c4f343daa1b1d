<p>Checking a YouTube video about Docker (for my Synology, where it&rsquo;s called Container). Everything today is Docker this Docker that. Turns out it&rsquo;s kind of like a VM, so I kind of get it. Trying to figure out how to tell the actual path in the YAML file from those virtual ones for configs like timezones, etc.</p>
