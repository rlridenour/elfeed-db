<p>President Trump canceled a planned surge of federal immigration agents and a possible National Guard deployment to San Francisco after speaking with the city’s mayor and Bay Area business leaders and at the request of friends, officials said this week . The announced plan had involved moving federal personnel to the Bay Area in response to immigration-enforcement goals, a move that prompted large protests across the city and surrounding towns . The withdrawal averted an immediate federal presence that critics said would escalate tensions and allowed local leaders to publicly welcome the decision while activists urged continued demonstrations and a planned sit-in in Washington, DC on 5 November .</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/o9TYxn1e95CZmSOp4dlA8Cp5-kGUu2sobHU6Vm4FUx48zM0bHGz8dbLOvprRpMuMJ1ZnZvzZp8e0Tv2FjmiUTIsCLqgHviR0VzxeXTandhGMMzrSI-btd0mrlKOQjWoXpUjZKYApysC80XsWT2V_2J4ZhJ0mD90oXttZTU2E-ucTOdvAWL7xE-sNaiY_YZF3GSRybhvAV0_85dvsiwWoiplTa_XhQEUxFIZmXWY0aXAVWbgRS9xinrWcVzs2J3pSef62MGNA86wp4SwgycYG' alt='Protesters gather in San Francisco as reports of federal agents mounting a crackdown circulated' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Planned staging: Reports said more than 100 Customs and Border Protection agents were to be staged at a US Coast Guard base in Alameda as part of the enforcement plan .</li><li>Large protests: Thousands of people marched from the Ferry Building to the ICE building in San Francisco, with an early-morning 5 a.m. protest in nearby Alameda after federal agents were spotted .</li><li>Humorous resistance: Demonstrators used satire and costumes — including at least one inflatable frog and clown performances — as a deliberate tactic to mock the idea of troops in peaceful cities .</li><li>Military option considered: Reporting said the White House had also weighed deploying the National Guard to make San Francisco a symbolic example of law-and-order policy under Democratic leadership .</li></ul><blockquote>We wanted to bring some fun to the movement, and poke fun at the actual ridiculousness of sending troops to peaceful cities, - Clay Mazing</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>President Trump: He said he called off the operation after conversations with the city&#x27;s mayor, Silicon Valley leaders and at the request of friends who live in the Bay Area .
