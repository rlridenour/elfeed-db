<p>In 2012, archaeologists discovered in Southern Turkey a well-preserved mosaic featuring a skeleton savoring a loaf of bread and a pitcher of wine, surrounded by the Greek words “Be cheerful and live your life.” Dating back to the 3rd century BCE, the mosaic likely adorned the dining room of a wealthy villa in the ancient Greco-Roman city of Antioch. It’s a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">memento mori</a>, a reminder that life is short and you should enjoy it while you can. Or so that’s how many have interpreted the message of the mosaic.</p>
