<p>In a <a href="https://dailynous.com/2018/11/22/happy-thanksgiving-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous Thanksgiving post</a> that first appeared in 2016, I noted that a 1975 article in <em>Ethics </em>by <a href="https://www.apaonline.org/page/berger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fred Berger</a> (then a philosopher at UC Davis), &#8220;<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/291969" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gratitude</a>&#8220;, begins with the following:<span id="more-55761"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image">Gratitude is not a subject much discussed in the philosophical literature, though hardly a book or article is published without some expression of gratitude by the author for the help of others. From the literature, one would have to conclude that gratitude plays a role in our moral life which, with only a few exceptions, philosophers have not seen fit to explore.</em></p>
<p>I then pointed to the <em class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> entry, “<a class="wp-dark-mode-bg-image" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gratitude/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gratitude</a>,” by <a href="https://www.siena.edu/faculty-and-staff/person/tony-manela/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tony Manela</a> (Sienna University), which had just been published the year before, noting how things have changed.</p>
<p>I recently looked at it, and it has been updated since then (in 2019).</p>

<p>There are also now <a href="https://philpapers.org/s/gratitude" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many articles on the subject</a> &#8212; in case you&#8217;re looking for some further philosophical reading that&#8217;s fitting for the day.</p>
