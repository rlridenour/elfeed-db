<p>Back in 2007 I noted the <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/2007/05/19/manufacturing-feat/">report</a> of a curious wager in Berkshire in 1811: Sir John Throckmorton of Newbury bet a thousand guineas that he could have a coat made between sunrise and sunset of a single summer&#8217;s day, from the shearing of the sheep to the finished coat&#8217;s delivery by the tailor.</p>
<p>This appears to be true &#8212; in 1899 the <em>Strand</em> published <a href="https://archive.org/details/strand-1899-v-17/page/218/mode/2up?view=theater">a retrospective of the feat</a>, including the first photo of the finished coat and the remarks of 93-year-old Charles Coxeter, the sole surviving witness and the younger brother of John Coxeter, the cloth manufacturer who had superintended most of the work. The sheep had been sheared at 5 a.m., and by 6:20 p.m. Throckmorton was able to don the finish coat before a crowd of 5,000 people, an hour and three-quarters before the deadline.</p>
<p>Coxeter was a curiously ambitious man: After the Battle of Waterloo he sponsored the preparation of a plum pudding 20 feet long, &#8220;which was cooked under the supervision of twelve ladies.&#8221; The &#8220;monster pudding&#8221; was carried to his house on a timber wagon drawn by two oxen and declared by all who partook &#8220;as nice as mother makes &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
