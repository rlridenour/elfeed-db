<br/>
<h3>iPhone 16 Pro Max 80% Charge Limit: One Year Later, Was It Worth It?</h3><br/>
For several years, Apple has allowed iPhone users to set a custom charge limit for their devices, capping the charge at 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% with an eye toward preserving battery health.<br/>

<h3>Next Apple TV Expected to Launch This Year With These New Features</h3><br/>
We're still expecting several hardware updates before the end of the year, and the Apple TV is one of those products on the list.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-TV-2025-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2909" height="1636" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988206" /><br/>
In the wake of Apple's iPhone and other announcements earlier this month, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/22/what-to-expect-from-next-apple-tv/">we've revisited and recapped rumors</a> about what we may see with the next update to Apple's set-top box.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Apple Confirms iOS 26 Wallet Passport Feature is Coming in 2025</h3><br/>
One of the announced iOS 26 features that was missing at launch was the Digital ID feature that will bring U.S. passports to the Wallet app on iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/ios-26-digital-id-passport-wallet.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005400" /><br/>
With the launch of iOS 26, Apple said that the feature would be coming in a software update, and the company has now updated the wording on its iOS 26 features page to confirm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/23/ios-26-wallet-passport-feature-2025/">the feature will be coming later this year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There's no visible sign of the feature in the first iOS 26.1 beta seeded this week, but many of these Wallet ID features like driver's licenses for various U.S. states (including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/25/iphone-drivers-license-north-dakota/">imminent addition of North Dakota</a>) can be activated server-side by Apple without necessitating a specific iOS update.<br/>
<br/>
