<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write a post on this for a while, but &mdash; <em>gestures at the world in general</em> &mdash; things got in the way. If you have been reading this blog for a while, you will know that I have had a lot of fun <a href="https://www.rousette.org.uk/tags/keyboards/">assembling or designing</a> several keyboards. I had enormous fun doing that, and learned a lot along the way about the layouts and features of keyboards that worked well for me. At some point through that process, I noticed that ZSA had brought out a new board: the <a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager">Voyager</a>, which was their first to use low-profile Kailh Choc switches. It took me a while to make the decision, but eventually I bought one, selling my old ErgodoxEZ to offset the cost.</p>
<h3 id="would-i-like-it">Would I like it?</h3>
<p>It turned out to be great decision, but by no means an instant one. I loved my &lsquo;home-made&rsquo; boards, and there were some aspects of the Voyager that I thought I would not enjoy. It has many more keys than any of my other split keyboards (52), and I worried that this was a) a waste if I did not use them, and b) that it would seem huge in comparison to my TOTEM keyboards. Having got comfortable with three thumb keys on the TOTEM, I worried about whether I would be able to go back to only two (as on the <a href="https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/ferris-sweep-keyboard-and-layout/">Ferris Sweep</a>). The Voyager uses a wired connection only, and I had got used to using Bluetooth with the TOTEM. Finally (and most ridiculously), I worried that I would find the wider MX spacing of the keys uncomfortable after having got used to the narrower Choc spacing. As it turned out, none of those things mattered once I got my hands on the keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="build-quality">Build quality</h3>
<p>As I noted above, I&rsquo;ve had a ZSA keyboard before (the ErgodoxEZ), which was the board that got me hooked on columnar split keyboards. I only stopped using it because I fell in love with low-profile boards, and because the ErgodoxEZ is a gigantic keyboard compared to most low-profile layouts. As someone with tiny Hobbit hands, I have found smaller boards to be much more ergonomic for me.</p>
<p>However, that meant that I knew that their build quality and attention to detail was excellent, and the reliability of the boards was very good. I think that they have got even better over time, as the Voyager&rsquo;s build quality and design is superb. The things that are very hard to get right when you build your own keyboards and 3D print cases are solidity, rigidity and weight, particularly for low-profile boards. There are probably ways to balance the outline of a home-made board better so that it doesn&rsquo;t have a tendency to tip or slip on the desk or desk mat, or to add weights to give it a feel of solidity, but you have to be a good industrial designer.</p>
<p>The very first thing you notice when you unpack the Voyager and put it on your desk is that it feels dense and solid, and that &mdash; with or without the magnetic tenting feet attached &mdash; it does not feel as if it is going anywhere. It is incredibly solid and stable. It doesn&rsquo;t rock or tip or slip however you type on it, and on any flat surface (bare desk top or on a mat), it stays put. I hadn&rsquo;t realised what a positive effect that would have on the comfort and ergonomics of using it.</p>
<p>The magnetic feet are amazing. As others have commented, they are fixed on incredibly strongly, and also include tiny locating pegs so there is no danger of them sliding around. They only provide a small amount of tilt, but I find it enough to increase comfort a bit while still enabling me to rest my wrists on the surface of the desk. If I am just pulling out my keyboard to use briefly (it travels back and forth to work with me), I use it without the feet with no problems, but for longer stretches, I prefer the tilt. ZSA must use some kind of magic spell on the underside of the keyboard, because the rubber &lsquo;feet&rsquo; (tiny, thin strips) are barely visible, but stick the board to the desk like a limpet, with or without the tenting feet.</p>
<p>If you prefer a steeper tilt, ZSA provides <a href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager/printables#tenting-bar">STL files</a> to enable you to design your own tenting arrangement, and the magnetic feet are even designed to unscrew so that you can re-use the magnets inside them for your own design. This highlights one of the things I love about ZSA: they produce great designs using all their expertise and opinions about what works best, but they also encourage people to make the boards their own (voiding the warranty of course, so at your own risk). They even have <a href="https://blog.zsa.io/tags/repair/">blog posts</a> on the company site about repairing and modifying their boards.</p>
<p>The included custom keycaps feel wonderful (not too textured, but not slippery), and the unusual placement of the homing bar on the home keys is great. You can choose between a variety of legends on the caps, or &lsquo;blank&rsquo; keys which have only a dot on them to let the LEDs shine through. I had got used to blank keys anyway, so went for those.</p>
<p>Other nice features are the pair of red/green LEDs on each half of the board which light up in a binary sequence to show you which layer number you are on (and indicate when the board is in boot mode), the handy but low profile reset button on the top edge of the left half (no more digging in drawer for a paper clip!), and the position of the TRRS sockets on the top edge of the board. Finally, one tiny but excellent detail is that the surface of the board has a pair of indented grooves either side of each switch. This makes it far easier to securely grasp the switch to remove it cleanly without scratching the material, even though the material seems very durable in my experience so far.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-my-worries">What about my worries?</h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s all very well, but what about the issues I worried about before purchase?</p>
<p>The size of the board turned out to be a non-issue. I do find the topmost row harder to hit so rarely use it, but leave it configured in the traditional way with number keys. This is handy to type numbers one-handed if I am on the phone or something. Otherwise, I enter numbers via a layer (see below). I do use the outer column quite a bit and find it both easy to reach and useful for frequently used keys. While the board is certainly larger than my TOTEM, it is not substantially larger than the overall footprint, and it feels like a very sleek, compact keyboard. I adapted to the MX spacing very quickly, and don&rsquo;t notice it now. The custom keycaps make it look tightly spaced visually anyway.</p>
<p>It did take a bit of experimentation with layout to figure out what to put on the thumb keys, but again, I have no problem using only two keys now that I am used to it. I also really enjoy having a 1.5U keycap on the outer thumb keys for comfort and satisfaction when you thwack them. I use those keys for one-shot shift (left side) and space (right side), so they are my most used keys.</p>
<p>I love the clean look and flexibility of using a wireless connection on a board. However, in longer term use on my own boards, that came with quite a few annoyances. Bluetooth can be very finicky, and I often found myself mashing keys when turning on they keyboard, not sure whether it was having problems connecting, on the wrong profile or whatever. It also means that you have to attend to battery charging, giving you another thing to think about. A wired board just works, first time, and instantly. I keep a set of cables attached to my set ups at home and work, so I only have to unpack the halves from the travel case and plug in. At home, the USB cable is attached to the hub built in to my monitor, so any computer attached to the monitor is connected automatically to the keyboard.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t yet mentioned the per-key LEDs, but that is another advantage of having a wired board. I learned the hard way that LEDs are the very devil to solder reliably on to a board at home, but I do enjoy a board with lights! I set mine to a very slow rainbow gradient animation that moves from left to right over both halves, and it brings a little bit of joy every time I look down at my hands thinking about what to type. Since you can set the colour of each key, on each layer, I also use it both to identify what layer I am on, and to provide a coloured pattern to remind me about the function of each key, which is surprisingly useful.</p>
<h3 id="layout-and-oryx">Layout and Oryx</h3>
<div style="padding-top: 60%; position: relative;">
	<iframe src="https://configure.zsa.io/embed/voyager/layouts/9jlqK/latest/0" style="border: 0; height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%"></iframe>
</div>
<p>ZSA provides an online configuration tool called Oryx, and you can see my current layout in the embed above or <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/voyager/layouts/9jlqK/latest/0">here</a>. Oryx is amazing. While I have got pretty comfortable configuring keyboards by using either ZMK or QMK manually (i.e. with configuration files), Oryx is so much more convenient, particularly when you get to the stage of tweaking a few keys iteratively to see what works best. Configuring LED colours per-key would be a gigantic pain in code I think, and very error-prone. However, you do get the best of both worlds, because you can download the source at any time and plug it in to QMK if you want to use some of QMK&rsquo;s more advanced features. Having said that, ZSA fold new QMK features in to Oryx fairly regularly, so it continues to get more capable.</p>
<p>My current layout is more or less an evolution of ones I have used with the TOTEM: it is ColemakDHm for the alphas, and then a layout that is broadly inspired my Miryoku (though moving away from that progressively). I have six layers (though rarely use the mouse layer - it is just there for convenience). The biggest recent changes have been to move from home row mods to lower row mods, which for me, completely avoids any accidental triggering of modifiers, while still feeling very ergonomic. Actually, this would have worked less well on my self-made boards because of the lack of stability I mentioned earlier. Holding down keys on the top or bottom rows could make the board tip up if not done carefully, but there are no problems with that on the Voyager.</p>
<p>The other thing I have done is add one-shot triggers for a symbol layer on the outer key on the lower row. This enables me to have easy access to brackets and some convenience macros for assignment operators like <code>-&gt;</code> or <code>=&gt;</code>, while placing other symbols on the left hand where they appear on the number layer when shift is added. I have duplicated some keys on some layers for the same reason, as I have to think less about which layer a key is on. It is also handy to have keys in all the places where they are contextually relevant. For example, I have <code>~</code> and <code>/</code> on the navigation layer (as I use them a lot for navigation in the terminal), but they are in the same location on the symbol layer to aid in muscle memory. I do a similar thing with mathematical operators (<code>+, -, =</code> etc.) on the number and symbol layers. Some of the duplicated keys are also there to be in the same position on the Voyager as they are (roughly) on my laptop keyboard (e.g. Tab). That&rsquo;s the luxury that more keys gives you I guess.</p>
<p>You might notice that I have the <code>Ctrl</code> key lower row mod on my index finger. Since I use both macOS and Linux computers with the keyboard, <code>Ctrl</code> is the most used key on Linux, and <code>Cmd</code> is most used on macOS. On macOS, I use the built in system preference to switch the Control and Command keys on the Voyager only (not the laptop&rsquo;s built in keyboard). This has the happy side effect of meaning that my &lsquo;main key&rsquo; is in the same physical location on both machines. I also found that setting up combos for save, cut, copy, and paste using the <code>Ctrl</code> key (see my navigation and mouse layers) automatically translates that correctly to the macOS variant when I am on my MacBook. I know that there are tools that enable more comprehensive key translation across operating systems, but I find that this solves 90% or so of the uses, and is easy to set up and reverse if needed.</p>
<h3 id="silent-switches">Silent switches</h3>
<p>Another recent change I have made is to replace the switches that came with the board. I chose the Choc Pro Reds, as they were the closest to the linear Choc Pro Pinks I was using before. They felt fine, and I didn&rsquo;t mind the very slightly heavier feel than the Pinks enough to bother swapping them out with my spares. However, I had noticed that some <a href="https://lowprokb.ca/products/ambients-silent-choc-switches">new designs had been produced by LowproKB</a>, which were specifically engineered to be much quieter, with damped action and significantly reduced stem rattle. They currently make three models: Twilight and Nocturnal which are both linear switches (35g and 20g respectively), and Sunset which are 40g tactile switches. The page on LowproKB&rsquo;s site lists International stockists, but I got my Ambients Nocturnal from <a href="https://mechboards.co.uk/products/lowprokb-ambients-silent-linear-nocturnal-choc-v1?_pos=7&amp;_fid=28107442e&amp;_ss=c">Mechboards in the UK</a>. The Nocturnals are about the same actuation force as the Pro Pinks I have used a lot, but my goodness, what a difference in feel!</p>

</figure>

<p>I should say that I didn&rsquo;t find the Pinks obnoxiously noisy or unstable, so I thought the Ambient Nocturnals would be a minor upgrade. I was wrong: the difference &mdash; if you will pardon the circadian pun &mdash; is night and day. It&rsquo;s so hard to convey a tactile sensation in words, but the Nocturnals feel luxurious and precision-made. They are soft but not at all mushy or imprecise, and so quiet that you can barely hear them. I ended up with one switch too few for my board (they are sold in packs of 10, and I got one bonus extra across my 5 packs), so I put a Pro Pink in the upper rightmost key on the right half. The difference in sound levels is stark when you hit that key amid a series of strokes on the other Ambient keys. Changing the keys has raised an already wonderful keyboard to another level. If you like linear or tactile keys, they are definitely worth trying. The Nocturnals have a smoked grey upper case and you may wonder (as I did) whether it impairs the per-key LEDs. I searched for information on this in vain before buying, but I can tell you that it makes minimal difference. It reduces the brightness and darkens the saturation very slightly, but if I didn&rsquo;t have a comparison Pro Pink key side by side with the Nocturnals, I am not sure I would be able to tell.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Well, this has been a bit of an epic post, but I have been so impressed by the Voyager. I don&rsquo;t regret a second of the time (or money) I spent building my other boards, as I enjoyed the process enormously and it taught me a lot about what works and doesn&rsquo;t work for me. If I hadn&rsquo;t made those, I don&rsquo;t think I would have recognised the Voyager as the sweet spot I was looking for all along. I still occasionally use my other boards as spares, but the Voyager is my favourite to type on by far.</p>
<p>I probably should have declared this at the top, but needless to say, this is not a sponsored post. I bought the Voyager with my own money, unprompted by ZSA (other than my own experience with their products previously, also purchased with my own money). I&rsquo;m just a happy customer.</p>
