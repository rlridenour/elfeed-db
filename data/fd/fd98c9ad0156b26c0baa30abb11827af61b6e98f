Dolby Atmos is a surround-sound audio format that allows sound to be heard in an immersive, three-dimensional audio experience with compatible stereo headphones and speakers. Apple's Spatial Audio technology takes Dolby Atmos content and applies its own directional audio filters to make sounds appear to be coming from all around you.<br/>
<br/>
The feature was added in version 1.1284.20225 of &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; for Windows. A <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ph/guide/music-windows/musf7d98bef8/windows">new Apple Support document</a> called "Play Dolby Atmos in Music on Windows" explains how to use it on a PC.<br/>
