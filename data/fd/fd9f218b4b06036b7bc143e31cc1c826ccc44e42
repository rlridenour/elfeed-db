<p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping held an unusual phone call with President Trump on Monday in which the two discussed trade, Taiwan and the war in Ukraine, and agreed that Trump would visit China in April while Xi would make a state visit to the United States later next year. Trump said the call was &quot;very good&quot; and framed it as building on a fragile trade truce that followed their in‑person meeting in South Korea last month, where they sought to cool tensions over tariffs and technology controls. Xi used the conversation to reiterate Beijing’s longstanding position that Taiwan’s eventual &quot;return to China&quot; is an essential element of the post‑World War II order, a message that comes as China protests recent US arms sales to Taipei and increasing security cooperation between Washington and Tokyo. The call also touched on China’s interest in playing a larger role in peace efforts over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, even as Washington continues its own negotiations with Kyiv and Moscow, and on issues such as fentanyl and Chinese purchases of American soybeans, signaling that both governments still see value in dialogue despite sharp strategic frictions.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/lra5fVe9LBOuFXfdFlAjjEEy_F7Blw-ZQdWYOlQpS-FHSz8UuHBf_5NTRPWbe1kN7Nh3WkkG17eAitSWNvMlctXtWs6qaLD797vjQcmUv_DMYphaf1Xr6FmI-xOxhJdIrb1Z-_bDLrkDSTYvnnIvlknqhGoDjC9CPjdJU-yjpQOwYR9thkJANHAxLyX-Niv8HANY2L24ghGbO7ZnIJ9iF3gEELe7HKZSQ9mxcugdNn0qF7M_e4lLa1kWeoxNlQxBqFcFZ9Wj5wGXOPEqnw' alt='President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands during their October meeting in Busan, South Korea, ahead of renewed phone diplomacy.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Planned April visit: Trump said he accepted Xi’s invitation to travel to Beijing in April and in turn invited the Chinese leader for a state visit to the United States later next year, marking the first such reciprocal visits announced since his inauguration.</li><li>Trade and soybeans: US and Chinese accounts of the call both highlighted discussions on trade, with Trump emphasizing purchases of American soybeans as part of efforts to stabilize economic ties after months of tariff disputes and technology export restrictions.</li><li>Ukraine peace role: Analysts noted that Beijing placed particular stress on Ukraine, seeing the need to be more directly involved in peace talks as Washington advances its own contacts with Kyiv and Moscow while China has supported Russia’s wartime economy.</li><li>Japan alliance focus: Within hours of speaking to Xi, Trump held a separate call with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, where both sides reaffirmed close US‑Japan cooperation and discussed security challenges across the Indo‑Pacific region.</li><li>China–Japan tensions: Xi’s outreach to Trump and Beijing’s parallel messaging came amid a diplomatic feud with Tokyo over comments by Japan’s leader about Taiwan, with Chinese officials appealing to the United States as a fellow World War II victor and pressing countries in the region to take positions on the Taiwan issue.</li></ul><blockquote>Taiwan&#x27;s return to China is an important component of the postwar international order - Xi Jinping</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>White House: Trump described the conversation as &quot;very good&quot; and highlighted progress in easing trade frictions, including talks over Chinese purchases of American agricultural products and further discussions planned during his April trip to Beijing.
