<p>I recently came across <a href="https://www.thoughtasylum.com/2025/04/26/homepod-mini-for-mac-audio/">Stephen Millard&#8217;s write-up on routing Mac Studio audio through a HomePod mini</a>. He ran into some disconnect hiccups, but, unsurprisingly, solved it with a handy Keyboard Maestro macro.</p>



<p>Lately I&#8217;ve noticed a wave of seasoned iPad power users making the jump to macOS, and almost invariably the first app they rave about is Keyboard Maestro. It&#8217;s the one tool on the Mac that can truly automate almost anything you can imagine. No other utility comes close to its depth and flexibility.</p>



<p>I like the app so much that I made a&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.macsparky.com/p/km">Keyboard Maestro Field Guide</a>&nbsp;to help you get up to speed quickly and start building your own custom macros.</p>



<p>One idea I noted from Stephen&#8217;s article was audio routing. I record with a mic connected to my audio interface with an XLR cable, so those built-in USB-connected mic mute software buttons don’t work. But I bet I could mirror Stephen&#8217;s output-switch macro on the input side, muting my mic’s audio channel with a single keystroke. That&#8217;s now officially on my “research projects” list.</p>
