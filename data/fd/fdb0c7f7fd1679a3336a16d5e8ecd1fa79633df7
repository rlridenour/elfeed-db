<p>To kickstart the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Carnival">Emacs Carnival</a>, and as a hat tip to our recent inspiration, this month’s topic is borrowed from the June IndieWeb Blog Carnival: the topic is “Take Two”, hosted <a href="https://www.nicksimson.com/posts/2025-indieweb-carnival-take-two.html">by Nick Simon</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ever wish for a do-over? “Take two!” (or three, four, etc.) might be shouted by a film director or audio engineer looking to get a somewhat different outcome from a group of actors or musical performers. Would you like a second shot at something that didn’t land?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a perfect fit for Emacs users:</p>

<p>We usually don’t nail “it” on our first try – <code>init.el</code> bancruptcy; refactoring hacky Emacs Lisp code; leaving Emacs only to come back englightened much later; running two Emacsens in parallel. There are plenty of possible second takes when it comes to Emacs!</p>

<p>So for this month, our first community blog carnival, I want you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meditate on “Emacs” and “take two”,</li>
  <li>blog about it,</li>
  <li>then send me a link to your blog post.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it!  I’ll aggregate submissions for all of June in this post.</p>

<p>Don’t have a blog, yet?</p>

<p>Well, just start one already! :)</p>

<p>It’s the future of the internet!</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-blog-carnival-again">What’s a Blog Carnival, Again?</h2>

<p>This is our first Emacs Carnival, so you may not know the format. A blog carnival is a fun way to tie together a community with shared writing prompts, and marvel at all the creative interpretations of the topic of the month. I’ve provided a couple of interpretations above, but you may think of something else entirely. That’s amazing, roll with it, that’s what makes this fun!</p>

<p>Thanks to Sacha Chua for her post <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/05/working-on-the-plumbing-in-a-small-web-community/">“Working on the plumbing of a small web community”</a> that was part of the May 2025 IndieWeb Carnival, and got me thinking why there’s no Emacs Carnival, yet, and for her encouragement to kickstart this.</p>

<p>For future Carnivals, check out the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Carnival">“Carnival” page on EmacsWiki </a>. It includes instructions, and is our community space to coordinate participants and topic ideas.</p>
