<p>A US federal judge declined to halt the Trump administration’s stepped-up Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minnesota, rejecting a request from Minnesota’s attorney general and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for an injunction. The judge said ICE activity could have &quot;heartbreaking&quot; effects but ruled the plaintiffs had not met the legal standard to block it at this stage. The ruling comes amid weeks of protests tied to the operation, including demonstrations in freezing conditions in Minneapolis and solidarity marches in other US cities. Tensions have also drawn fresh attention to press freedom after two journalists, including Don Lemon, were arrested while covering an anti-ICE protest inside a Minnesota church; Lemon has said he was doing his job reporting.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/g2q4igy39L4cKwEE_QLLY7YxjMWl9I2MUGKvcLhEFKggTp8vRSd0SVYags2_uG-wTwJcgnt71I5mbuI-_ATTt43Om0dINZR5I9iNpi8VMkOOqDr5zF5DZEobFsVHq4HOBWRnYYREnmGpYWgDx3dcXBdapCrA2TwA3aGG5MMY900lBUCPZ7GZoKik8DpoLimIDpHy5yS4zpwFlkkpuqaYay4JN0UJu97FL5eibCBuAwgLr39PHE31mQLwv3v87mdRen3KjtV5lmSg6ZZCkA' alt='A federal immigration agent in St. Paul, Minnesota.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Church arrests: Don Lemon and reporter Georgia Fort were arrested and taken to court after covering an anti-ICE protest inside a Minnesota church, a development that has intensified scrutiny of how authorities treat journalists at protests.</li><li>Legal challenge: Minnesota’s lawsuit was filed by the state attorney-general alongside the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul seeking to stop the enforcement surge, but the court declined to grant an injunction.</li><li>Deaths referenced: Reporting on Operation Metro Surge links the operation to two killings by federal agents, which helped fuel public demonstrations and the state’s legal pushback.</li><li>Public mobilization: Thousands marched in downtown Minneapolis as part of a broader strike and protest against ICE operations, with additional rallies reported in other US cities.</li><li>Culture and protest: Protest coverage described a large Minneapolis rally after an anti-ICE concert featuring Bruce Springsteen, including mention of his song paying tribute to two dead protesters.</li></ul><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Don Lemon: Lemon said he was doing his job as a journalist when he was arrested while reporting on the church protest.
