<blockquote>
  <p>Just a day and a half before it was set to be broadcast, new CBS
News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss pulled a planned 60 Minutes
investigative segment centering on allegations of abuses at an El
Salvador detention center where the Trump administration sent
hundreds of Venezuelan migrants last March.</p>

<p>Weiss told colleagues this weekend the piece — planned for Sunday
night’s show — could not run without an on-the-record comment
from an administration official. She pushed for 60 Minutes to
interview Stephen Miller, senior advisor to President Trump, or
someone of his stature. That’s according to two people with
knowledge of events at the network who spoke on condition of
anonymity, citing job security.</p>

<p>The correspondent on the story, Sharyn Alfonsi, condemned the
decision in an email to 60 Minutes colleagues on Sunday evening,
saying she believed it was “not an editorial decision, it is a
political one.” [...] Alfonsi wrote that she and her colleagues on
the story had sought comments and interviews from the Department
of Homeland Security, the White House and the State Department.</p>

<p>“Government silence is a statement, not a VETO,” Alfonsi wrote in
the email. “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes
a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a
‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not surprising in the least bit that Weiss tried to censor a jarring report on Trump’s illegal torture prison in El Salvador. It is, perhaps, slightly surprising how dumb this attempt is. Of course it’s a good principle of journalism to allow the other side of a story to comment or be interviewed. But the idea that the other side can just decline to participate and that means you can’t run the story is like fingers-in-your-ears “I can’t hear you!” playground nonsense. You run the story and say that they declined to comment.</p>

<p>It’s not just that Weiss kiboshed a solid piece of reporting from 60 Minutes. It’s that the editor-in-chief of CBS News is now on the record as saying that the entire staff of 60 Minutes wanted to run an unfair hit piece on the Trump administration. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/07/curse_not_the_king_cbs_colbert_trump">The decline of CBS</a> as an institution continues.</p>
