<p>The UK government is reassessing whether to pursue closer defence cooperation with the European Union, including renewed engagement with the EU’s Security Action for Europe (SAFE) financing scheme as part of a wider post-Brexit “reset” in relations. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said Europe needs to increase defence capability and that the UK should examine ways to work more closely with European partners, potentially through SAFE or other initiatives. The discussions come after earlier attempts to secure fuller UK participation in the EU’s SAFE loan program failed in November following a dispute over the UK’s financial contribution, leaving the UK able to access SAFE only as a third country rather than as a more integrated partner. Officials and ministers are meeting to consider next steps ahead of upcoming trade and security talks with the EU, with the aim of strengthening cooperation while navigating the political sensitivities of post-Brexit alignment.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/SB9p_MPWf_npZxI8dEoFVXOqgtQh4EgvAMp_3UQoDjhHJd-rfE35O6_dq_YyGKXaK0-GjE1VM50_5nAwXZr-3ApZlFfBuHNp_I9ObyoYVygEWczF6R3QP2nk1iDlbO9jNEfkD2wqKYCV1ggTbJvvGQrp4j4kX-43LPH7CE-c-eR7REvQu1o110Gs1iuGi3MfpFK6OXxKQu-MrF8PRrXPGrSTLJ_WPJAk7eO2QGkjz7HN0wk6hLrwg7stOKXN2oEtT0Y' alt='UK and EU flags pictured as Britain explores closer defence cooperation with the bloc.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Talks resume: Starmer said the UK should consider resuming negotiations on an EU defence pact as one route to building shared military capability with European states.</li><li>Beijing comments: Speaking while visiting China, Starmer told reporters he wanted “some progress” on European defence spending, capability and cooperation, whether via SAFE or other mechanisms.</li><li>Commission caution: A European Commission spokesperson said it “will not speculate on a possible second SAFE fund at this stage,” tempering expectations of an imminent new round tailored for wider participation.</li><li>Alternative channel: Politico reported that another possible cooperation route could be the EU’s €90 billion loan for Ukraine, which the Netherlands and other countries would like the UK to join.</li><li>Domestic planning: UK ministers and officials are holding a meeting to discuss the broader reset agenda, covering security and trade ties alongside the defence-fund question.</li></ul><blockquote>I have made the argument that that should require us to look at schemes like SAFE and others to see whether there is a way in which we can work more closely together - Keir Starmer</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>UK government (Keir Starmer): The UK should explore closer European defence cooperation, with SAFE among the options, because Europe needs to do more to build defence capability.
