</ul><h1>A Splendad Deal</h1><p>We often sell stuff on here made by brands you’ve never heard of. And it’s one thing when the product is a charging hub or something. It’s another thing altogether when it’s a more-than-30-pack of a mysterious food or beverage.</p>
<p>So, it’s a good thing these are from Splenda. Because if Splenda made these, you can rest assured they taste… well… like Splenda.</p>
<p>No, we wouldn’t go so far as to say, “Because if Splenda made these, you can rest assured they taste good,” as the truth (or lack thereof) of this statement really comes down to the palate of the enjoyer.</p>
<p>What we’re getting at is that Splenda is polarizing. For some, it imparts the perfect sweetness without any calories or sugar. For others, it’s totally nasty.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: it’s so polarizing because most people have had Splenda before. And so, even if you haven’t tried their sweet tea or lemonade drink mixes, you probably have some idea of how they’ll taste and, in turn, if you’ll like them.</p>
<p>Which is a godsend in the arena of low or zero-sugar beverages.</p>
<p>Seriously, buying a low/zero calorie drink you’ve never tried before is like playing Russian Roulette for your tastebuds.</p>
<p>Maybe it’ll be very lightly sweetened, with sugar or something else, leaving you with only a hint of whatever flavor its supposed to have, like when you fill up the unrinsed glass you just drank some fruit punch out of with water.</p>
<p>Or, on the flip side, maybe you’ll crack open a cold bottle of something that tastes the way a Glade plug-in smells.</p>
<p>It can be nerve-wracking enough to buy a single serving. Going in on 36? That’s scary, regardless of the discount.</p>
<p>But again, you don’t have to worry about that with these. Because they’re Splenda.</p>
<p>To be clearer: they’re little capsules filled with concentrated sweet tea and pink lemonade. Liquid concentrate that is. According to the box: “No messy powder, easy to make.” You know, because a capsule of sweet liquid definitely poses zero mess potential, lol.</p>
<p>Anyway, you just pour one into your glass, mix with water, and you’re ready to go: sweet tea or lemonade with zero sugar and zero calories.</p>
<p>And you get 36 of them. For 9 bucks. Which is a great deal (if you like Splenda).</p>
<p>So buy them (if you like Splenda).</p>
