Apple's Notes app is rumored to be getting limited Markdown support in iOS 26 and macOS 26, according to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/03/exclusive-ios-26-messages-carplay-more/">9to5Mac</a></em>. The feature would allow users to export text in the markdown format.<br/>

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that some writers prefer to use over rich text. Rather than using HTML for bold, italics, links, and headers, Markdown uses quick character shortcuts like **bold** or #header. It sounds like the feature will only add support for exporting text with markdown formatting and not writing in markdown directly. <br/>

If the rumor holds up, it's likely to be unveiled at next week's Worldwide Developers Conference alongside other iOS 26 improvements, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/ios-26-messages-app-rumors/">automatic translation and polls in Messages</a>, not to mention a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-believes-users-love-major-ios-19-redesign/">major visual redesign</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 26</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS 26 Tahoe</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-notes/">Apple Notes</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/04/apple-notes-rumored-markdown-support-ios-26/">Apple Notes Expected to Gain Support for Exporting in Markdown in iOS 26</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-notes-expected-to-gain-support-for-exporting-in-markdown-in-ios-26.2458174/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
