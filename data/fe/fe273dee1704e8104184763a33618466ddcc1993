<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
This post exhumes an email exchange I had; one in which the sender was asking questions about using #Emacs for more things.

        <p>What follows is my response to an email I received in <time datetime="2023" title="2023">2023</time>.  The quoted regions
are from the sender, and the non-quoted regions are my response.</p>
<p>My hope in publishing this post is to provide a bit of insight into my process of
adopting <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>

I&rsquo;d like to use <span>Emacs</span>

<p>Switching context is the pathway to a thousand paper cuts of mental fatigue.</p>

Currently I use <span><a href="https://www.spacemacs.org">Spacemacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Spacemacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Spacemacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-SPACEMACS">📖</a></small>

for all
project planning and coding workflows (maybe even doing research and emailing as
well).

<p>It took me awhile to use <span>Org-Mode</span>
 in <span>Emacs</span>
; I was using Markdown.  But with my
latest job, I’m all in on <span>Org-Mode</span>
.  It is how I track and eventually report my
time.  I haven’t yet made the switch to email via <span>Emacs</span>
, but it is on my radar.</p>
<p>I’m still not using “all of it” but I’m building my way towards using more of it.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

I&rsquo;ve seen some articles out there about <span><a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org-Roam</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Org-Roam”" title="Other site-wide references of “Org-Roam”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ORG-ROAM">📖</a></small>
and using capture buffers to
efficiently capture thoughts, but once I start going down the rabbit hole of
custom <span>Org-Roam</span>
capture templates and customizing any package outside of the
<span>Spacemacs</span>
layer guardrails I get lost!

</blockquote>

<p>What are some of the capture templates you were creating?  I’m curious to
understand how you’re looking to use <span>Org-Roam</span>
.<small class="side-container">
  <span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
  <span class="side" role="note"> For myself I have about 5 capture templates; and I think one of them I rarely use.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> I had originally used <span>Org-Roam</span>
.  It is fantastic.  However, I started
extending it and found it somewhat more difficult and cumbersome.  I grew
concerned that I wouldn’t be smart enough in the future to further fix or
enhance that.  So I switched to <span><a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/denote">Denote</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Denote”" title="Other site-wide references of “Denote”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-DENOTE">&#128214;</a></small>
, which has amazing documentation and the
functionality that I wanted for <span>Org-Roam</span>
 (namely backlinks).</p>
<p>I wrote about this in <a href="https://takeonrules.com/2022/10/02/migration-plan-for-org-roam-notes-to-denote/">Migration Plan for Org-Roam Notes to Denote</a>.</p>

I also tend to get lost when I need to set up a development environment for any
of the programming languages that I use. I&rsquo;ve tried <span>Spacemacs</span>
for Java at work,
but all the packages installed by the Java layer cause my <span>Spacemacs</span>
instance to
slow to a crawl, and half of the <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol">Language Server Protocol</a></span> (<abbr title="Language Server Protocol">LSP</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Language Server Protocol”" title="Other site-wide references of “Language Server Protocol”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-LSP">📖</a></small>)
commands don&rsquo;t even work.

</blockquote>

<p>When I first started out, I picked <span>Spacemacs</span>
, but I have little experience
beyond a week or so with <span>Spacemacs</span>
.  I switched towards a basic install
(e.g. fresh install no packages) and then went hunting.</p>
<p>I don’t program in Java; I’m a Rubyist, so I don’t know the language server
ecosystem for Java.  I know for <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Ruby”" title="Other site-wide references of “Ruby”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-RUBY">&#128214;</a></small>
 there are two primary ones: <a href="https://solargraph.org/">Solargraph</a> and
<span>Ruby</span>
 Language Server.  Both of those servers deliver different functionality.
I’ve settled on <a href="https://solargraph.org/">Solargraph</a> as it has more of what I’m after (namely jump to
definition).</p>
<p>I write this wondering what functions you’re looking for from your language
server.</p>
<p>Also, I have explored using <abbr title="Language Server Protocol">LSP</abbr>
 Mode, and it added a more visual experience; but
settled on <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot">Eglot</a>.  In part because <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot">Eglot</a> has a smaller implementation foot
print, leveraging more of <span>Emacs</span>
 internals (and thus likely to stay “patched” and
“maintained”).</p>
<p>This follows on something I identified when switching from Ivy to <a href="https://github.com/minad/consult">Consult</a> as
well as from Company to <cite><a href="https://github.com/minad/corfu">Corfu</a></cite> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Corfu”" title="Other site-wide references of “Corfu”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-CORFU">&#128214;</a></small>

I&rsquo;d love to know how to surgically pick packages that will help me only, and cut
out anything unnecessary.

</blockquote>

<p>This was the approach I took when moving from <span>Spacemacs</span>
 and Doom.  I started
from a blank slate, went through the <span>Emacs</span>
 tutorial, and then just started
writing and coding.  I would stumble and say “previous setups had done this.
I’m going to go research how to do this.”</p>
<p>I’d find a few packages and look at their README’s, open issues, lines of code,
etc and then adopt one.  It was what first lead me to Ivy/Counsel/Swiper over
Helm and would later lead me to Consult/Vertico/Marginalia.</p>
<p>I did the above with the mindset of “I am learning and building my tools; so
other things will move slower.”  In other words, if you have an urgent task to
complete, maybe don’t do this.  But if you have some slack in time, do this.</p>
<p>These days I recommend picking a good package manager (elpaca or straight.el)
and installing one.  I personally use <a href="https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el">straight.el</a>.</p>
<p>I would also immediately adopt:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful/">helpful</a></dt>
<dd>to improve discoverability</dd>
<dt>consult</dt>
<dd>a nice extensible wrapper around a lot of <span>Emacs</span>
 functions.</dd>
<dt>marginalia</dt>
<dd>to get inline guidance on your <code>M-x</code> commands; and many other things</dd>
<dt>vertico</dt>
<dd>I like the veritcal completion experience.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a principle of building out a solid foundation of interacting with your
editor.  From there move to the specific interactions.</p>

<p>I haven’t fine-tuned <abbr title="Language Server Protocol">LSP</abbr>

Regarding the cruft of <span>Spacemacs</span>
, the startup time bothers me, and being
dependent on all the packages that layer maintainers stuff into their layers. I
want to explicitly craft my experience and not rely on what others think are
valuable packages to install. I want to know everything going into my instance
and how to use it.

<p>I appreciate that there are viable <span>Emacs</span>

</small>
</p>
<p>Agreed.  My pathway lead me to best understand what was happening.  It has meant
a lot more Yak-shaving, but I have an editor that moves with me.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

My problem with this though, is I don&rsquo;t know how to discover what I need. How do
I know what packages to look for? How do I know when to write my own elisp
config? No clue&hellip;

</blockquote>

<p>I used a multi-pronged approach.  Starting from a basic setup, I would just
start writing in <span>Emacs</span>
 and wonder “Hey, is there a function to do this?”</p>
<p>To know if there was something internally, meant I needed to figure out
introspection of interactive functions.  Then how to have meaningful
descriptions of those functions.  I would spend a bit of time scanning those
functions.  I might find something and read the docstring.  Often this would
lead to a neighborhood of functions.  I could use that neighborhood to lookup
the package.  Then search <a href="https://melpa.org">Melpa</a> for related or replacing packages.</p>
<p>Another strategy I adopted was to go to <a href="https://melpa.org">Melpa</a> and perform some sorting.  Finding
the recently changed packages; I’d scan those quickly to see what is getting
effort.  I’d also sort on most downloaded, to see what other folks are using.
And I’d look to last changed.  All of which to orient to the breadth of options.</p>
<p>And if I stumbled upon a bunch of “thispackage-*” I’d dig in; after all folks
were extending the baseline package.</p>
<p>I did all of this starting from a small baseline and building outward; from what
was generally applicable to the specific.  In a way, what is common to prog-mode
and text-mode?  Those are more useful than what is only text-mode and only
prog-mode.</p>

<blockquote  class="h-cite">

<p>Also, should I break my reliance on full <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Vim”" title="Other site-wide references of “Vim”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-VIM">📖</a></small>
keybindings and go for <span>Emacs</span>
only?
I don&rsquo;t know. If I have to constantly re-bind keys for evil-mode with every
package that I install I&rsquo;m thinking that I&rsquo;ll need to switch to <span>Emacs</span></p>
<p>keybindings.</p>


</blockquote>

<p>I don’t use <span>Vim</span>
 keybindings; even before using <span>Emacs</span>
 I was using its bindings.
I’m wondering if something like the <a href="https://github.com/noctuid/general.el">General package</a> might be useful.  I don’t
use it but it helps manage these things.</p>
