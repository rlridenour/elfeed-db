<p id="p2">As part of today&rsquo;s event, Apple unveiled a number of new accessories to complement the new iPhone Air, iPhone 17, and iPhone 17 Pro models, including a family of revamped cases and charging accessories.</p>
<p id="p3">Here&rsquo;s a roundup of all the new accessories we were able to spot on the Apple Store today following the event.</p>
<h2 id="techwoven-case">TechWoven Case</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/techwowen-1757452039187.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p5">Two years after Apple first unveiled &mdash; then partially discontinued &mdash; its FineWoven accessories, the company has completely revamped its line of iPhone cases with a new material named TechWoven.</p>
<p id="p6">According to Apple, not unlike FineWoven, the TechWoven case is made from a woven fabric composed of multiple colored yarns. It is coated with TPU and features aluminum buttons on each side. Just like all of Apple&rsquo;s cases released today, the TechWoven case comes with built-in magnets for compatibility with MagSafe accessories and charging solutions, as well as an integrated Camera Control passthrough button.</p>
<p id="p7">The TechWoven case <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGF44LL/A/iphone-17-pro-techwoven-case-with-magsafe-blue" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available today</a> for $59 in five colors: Blue, Purple, Sienna, Green, and Black.</p>
<p id="p8"><!--more--></p>
<p id="p9">It will be interesting to see whether the TechWoven case receives a better reception from the public than its ill-fated FineWoven predecessor and whether it is more resistant to scratches. Surprisingly, the new TechWoven case is only compatible with the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. iPhone 17 and iPhone Air buyers will have to go with Apple&rsquo;s other case options announced today or seek third-party alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="bumper-and-clear-cases">Bumper and Clear Cases</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/bumpercase-1757452165846.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p11">Apple also brought back the Bumper case (last seen in the iPhone 4 era), available exclusively for the new iPhone Air. The 2025 version of the polycarbonate Bumper case is clearly aimed at preserving the iPhone&rsquo;s Air thinness while adding protection to the frame of the device. As expected, the Bumper case leaves both the front and the back of the iPhone Air exposed.</p>
<p id="p12">The iPhone Air Bumper case <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MH004ZM/A/iphone-air-bumper-black" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available today</a> for $39 in four colors: Light Blue, Tan, Light Gray, and Black.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/clearcase-1757452296229.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p14">Apple&rsquo;s Clear cases also received a refresh today. While the Clear case for the iPhone 17 remains unchanged from the previous version, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max Clear case features a new, not-so-clear design with an opaque white section layered over the smaller glass back panel of the new Pro models.</p>
<p id="p15">The Clear case for the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGFW4LL/A/iphone-17-pro-max-clear-case-with-magsafe" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available today</a> for $49.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/aircase-1757452468740.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p17">Meanwhile, iPhone Air users will be able to buy a new, more traditional translucent case. It features a frosted texture on the inside but keeps a glossy finish on the exterior.</p>
<p id="p18">The iPhone Air case <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGH24LL/A/iphone-air-case-with-magsafe-shadow" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available today</a> for $49 in two variants: Frost and Shadow. Both variants will seemingly allow the iPhone Air&rsquo;s color to shine through the frosted translucent material.</p>
<h2 id="crossbody-strap">Crossbody Strap</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/crossbodystrap-1757452526403.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p20">In a somewhat surprising entry to Apple&rsquo;s accessory lineup, the company today unveiled a new Crossbody Strap compatible with all of its cases for the iPhone Air, iPhone 17, and 17 Pro models, with the exception of the Clear cases for iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro.</p>
<p id="p21">In appearance, the Crossbody Strap&rsquo;s texture and material look similar to Apple&rsquo;s new TechWoven case. It can be adjusted with magnets via a sliding mechanism and attaches to two connecting points positioned at the bottom corners of every supported case.</p>
<p id="p22">The Crossbody Strap <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGGE4LL/A/crossbody-strap-neon-yellow" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available today</a> for $59 in ten colors: Neon Yellow, Light Blue, Blue, Purple, Sienna, Orange, Tan, Green, Light Gray, and Black.</p>
<h2 id="the-magsafe-battery-returns">The MagSafe Battery Returns</h2>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/magsafebattery-1757452571198.png" alt="The new MagSafe Battery is thin and tall, which means it can only work with the new iPhone Air."><p class="image-caption">The new MagSafe Battery is thin and tall, which means it can only work with the new iPhone Air.</p></div>
<p id="p24">Apple&rsquo;s MagSafe Battery returns today to the Apple Store, but with one significant caveat. Despite its use of the now-standard MagSafe ring of magnets and USB-C, the new MagSafe battery is exclusively compatible with the iPhone Air and will not work with any other models. Based on Apple&rsquo;s illustrations released today, it seems that the tall design of the battery would inevitably interfere with the larger camera plateaus of both the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro models.</p>
<p id="p25">That being said, the iPhone Air MagSafe Battery seems like a good fit for the new iPhone model. Apple says the product supports up to 12W fast wireless charging on the go, bringing an additional 65% charge to the iPhone Air. The battery will charge smaller accessories directly via USB-C.</p>
<p id="p26">The iPhone Air MagSafe Battery <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGPG4AM/A/iphone-air-magsafe-battery" rel="noopener noreferrer">is available today</a> for $99.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else">Everything Else</h2>
<p id="p27">In the US, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGKN4AM/A/40w-dynamic-power-adapter-with-60w-max" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter</a> was listed today on the Apple Store for $39. Apple states that this adapter can dynamically deliver up to 60W of output through a feature called &lsquo;60W Max.&rsquo; It can charge iPhone 17 models to 50 percent in about 20 minutes and the iPhone Air to 50 percent in 30 minutes.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/orangewallet-1757452685514.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p29">Apple updated its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGH64ZM/A/iphone-finewoven-wallet-with-magsafe-fox-orange" rel="noopener noreferrer">MagSafe FineWoven Wallet</a> (available for $59) today with a new Fox Orange color, which should pair nicely with the orange iPhone 17 Pro.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/16ecase-1757452723415.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p31">Similarly, the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGYW4ZM/A/iphone-16e-silicone-case-neon-yellow" rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone 16e Silicone case</a> (available for $39) is also getting a new color today with the addition of Neon Yellow. The previously available Fuschia, Winter Blue, Lake Green, White, and Black colors remain for sale.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/beatskickstandcase-1757452792714.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p33">Apple also debuted new Beats cases for the iPhone Air, 17, and 17 Pro models. Unlike last year&rsquo;s Beats cases, which had a glossy finish, these new versions feature a matte finish that should reduce fingerprints and smudges.</p>
<p id="p34">iPhone 17 and 17 Pro buyers can choose either <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGKC4LL/A/beats-iphone-17-pro-case-with-magsafe-and-camera-control-granite-gray" rel="noopener noreferrer">a regular case</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGJN4LL/A/beats-iphone-17-pro-rugged-case-with-magsafe-and-camera-control-rocky-blue" rel="noopener noreferrer">a rugged case</a> with more saturated colors and a grippy texture, or <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGY94LL/A/beats-iphone-17-pro-max-kickstand-case-with-magsafe-and-camera-control-granite-gray" rel="noopener noreferrer">a special kickstand-on-a-lanyard variant</a>. They are available today for $45, $79, and $59, respectively. Only the regular Beats case is available for the iPhone Air. It is important to note that none of the Beats cases are compatible with Apple&rsquo;s Crossbody Strap.</p>
<div class="media-wrapper"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.macstories.net/newbands-1757452904932.png" alt=""><p class="image-caption"></p></div>
<p id="p36">Lastly, new Apple Watch bands were made available today across the line:</p>
<ul id="ul37"><li>For Apple Watch Ultra wearers, the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MGCL4AM/A/49mm-neon-green-ocean-band-black-titanium-finish" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ocean Band</a>, the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MG9R4AM/A/49mm-blue-bright-blue-trail-loop-m-l-black-titanium-finish" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trail Loop</a> and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MG9E4AM/A/49mm-terra-cotta-alpine-loop-medium-black-titanium-finish" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpine Loop</a> are all available in new colors, such as Terra Cotta, Anchor Green, and Neon Green for $99.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MFL84AM/A/46mm-turmeric-braided-solo-loop-size-0" rel="noopener noreferrer">Braided Solo Loop</a> ($99), the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MFFM4AM/A/46mm-dark-gray-sport-loop" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sport Loop</a> ($49), and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MFGY4AM/A/46mm-anchor-blue-sport-band-m-l" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sport Band</a> ($49) come in a range of new colors including Turmeric, Neon Yellow, Anchor Blue, Green Gray, Forest, and Midnight.</li>
