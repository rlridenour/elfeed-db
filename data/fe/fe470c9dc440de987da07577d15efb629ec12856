<p>Vladimir Nabokov composed this puzzle for his wife Véra in 1926. The title, &#8220;Crestos lovitxa Sirin,&#8221; roughly means &#8220;Nabokov&#8217;s crossword&#8221;: <em>krestlovitska</em> approximates the Russian <em>kreslovitsa</em>, &#8220;cross&#8221; plus &#8220;words&#8221;, and Sirin is a pseudonym Nabokov often used, a reference to the creatures of Russian mythology. The upper half of each wing contains the grid, the lower the clues.</p>
<p>Nabokov, a trained entomologist, had published the first crossword in Russian two years earlier. Forty years later, in the <em>Paris Review</em>, he likened writing a novel to creating a crossword: &#8220;The pattern of the thing precedes the thing. I fill in the gaps of the crossword at any spot I happen to choose.&#8221;</p>
