<h2>Recommended? yep</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.lucky7london.co.uk">Lucky 7</a> is a small nostalgic American diner on Westbourne Park road. I like the vibe, the space, and the unpretentious waiting staff. I go to Lucky 7 often enough, originally for the buttermilk pancakes, but the list of favorites on the menu keeps growing.</p>

<h2>Buttermilk Banana pancakes</h2>
<p>These are my favorite pancakes in London by far. Banana buttermilk pancakes and a few free coffee refills usually sort me out until dinner time. Add a side of bacon if extra hungry. You probably don't need it though.</p>

<h2>Reuben sandwich</h2>
<p>The reuben has been on Lucky 7's specials menu for months now. Not had many of these in London, but compared to The Brass Rail's, this reuben was a clear winner. The sandwich is huge and comes with fries. My girlfriend and I struggled to finish one between the two of us.</p>

<h2>Vanilla milkshake (add malt!)</h2>
<p>This milkshake hits the spot every time, but it's filling. You almost have to decide between the shake and an actual meal. If you must have it, add malt. Sorry, no picture.</p>
<h2>Huevos Rancheros</h2>
<p>This is a breakfast dish I can equally make (better?) at home, but Lucky 7 wins hands down every time I'm feeling particularly lazy. Sorry, no picture.</p>

<h2>Better suggestion?</h2>
<p>London is full of overhyped, gimmicky, and unnecessarily expensive restaurants. Very few deliver truly awesome food (even those expensive ones). Got suggestions? I'd love to hear from you <a href="https://twitter.com/xenodium">@xenodium</a>.</p>
