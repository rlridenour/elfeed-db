<p>My thanks to Hello Weather for sponsoring last week at DF. Regular readers know that I am an inveterate aficionado of weather apps. I’m not really much of a meteorology nerd, but I’m a pedestrian in a city with widely varying seasons. But even more so, I find weather apps to be a true playground for UI design and the presentation of quantitative information. Different weather apps take very different approaches, and I find the differences fascinating.</p>

<p>I first recommended Hello Weather <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/30/hello-weather">back in 2021</a>, and it’s been in my regular rotation of weather apps ever since. Back at the beginning of summer when they booked the sponsorship for this week, I started using the new version 4.0 (now up to 4.1.4) as my daily driver. I love it. It even has one of my favorite features for hot humid summers — a preference to set “feels like” as the primary temperature display (including in places like widgets). Hello Weather remains, as ever, attractive and useful in its design. And it offers everything you want in an iOS weather app: widgets for the home screen and Lock Screen, a Watch app, notification options (precipitation, severe storms, morning/evening forecast reports), and, wow, a veritable slew of forecast data providers to choose from.</p>

<p>Hello Weather’s privacy story is perfect: they collect zero user data, have no tracking or ads, and <a href="https://helloweather.com/privacy">their privacy policy</a> is written by humans for humans.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hello-weather/id978393692">download Hello Weather</a> and start a 7-day free trial.</p>
