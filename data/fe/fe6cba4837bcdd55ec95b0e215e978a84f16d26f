<p>Pope Leo XIV is making his first foreign journey as pontiff with a multi-day pilgrimage to Turkey and Lebanon, where he will meet political authorities and Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders amid tense regional conflicts. The trip will test his diplomatic skills as the first American pope as he seeks to encourage dialogue between faiths and call for protection of civilians caught in violence across the Middle East. In Lebanon, still scarred by war and deep economic crisis, preparations for his visit have sparked a rare sense of anticipation among communities that hope his presence can draw global attention and humanitarian support. In Turkey, he is expected to visit key religious sites and underline coexistence in a country that straddles Europe and the Middle East, while carefully navigating sensitive issues around religious minorities and regional power politics.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/l1NpYfohONRRdxpArd45upvitYulQmZuAFTMwlRLhntDJYinqNbvD7B6RXc5XJ_DhCVL_hYZJv4w6fZVDKAZozhbq53OYMKEO8DXz9gXrhVwjRutnXDvKs6T5EvU1MC7213OZKllJx4oJC5e5ZrGwrbojsT1I0OAlEuOJG_vVYv9uiwrW7snVuMv0Rt4S0Rn8PBkcZ3VeaW3eg' alt='Pope Leo XIV greeting pilgrims in St. Peter’s Square ahead of his first foreign trip to Turkey and Lebanon.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Focus on Lebanon: In Lebanon, the pope plans encounters with families displaced by recent fighting and with local church leaders who say they see the visit as a chance to revive international engagement with the country’s overlapping political and economic crises.</li><li>Interfaith outreach: The itinerary includes joint appearances with senior Muslim clerics and meetings with Jewish representatives, signaling an emphasis on strengthening relationships between the three Abrahamic faiths at a time of regional strain.</li><li>Choice of destinations: By choosing Turkey and Lebanon over his native United States or his longtime mission base in Peru, Leo XIV is underscoring a desire to engage early with regions where Christian communities live as small minorities alongside large Muslim populations.</li><li>Media attention: Global media outlets are closely following the journey, noting that it offers the first extended look at how history’s first American pope approaches geopolitics, public communication and security challenges on the road.</li><li>Security and logistics: Authorities in both Turkey and Lebanon have deployed heightened security and coordinated with Vatican teams to manage large crowds expected at public liturgies and prayer events during the visit.</li></ul><blockquote>People are tired, they are exhausted, but this visit reminds them they are not forgotten - A Maronite Catholic priest in Lebanon</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Vatican: Vatican officials describe the journey as a “pilgrimage of peace” designed to encourage dialogue among religious communities rather than to deliver specific political messages.
