<p>I was happy to see the blood oxygen sensor come back to the Apple Watch late last week. After months of being disabled due to a patent fight with Masimo, Apple turned it on again — but only&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/apple-bring-blood-oxygen-feature-some-us-watches-with-software-update-2025-08-14/">after securing approval for a workaround</a>&nbsp;that cleverly meets legal constraints.</p>



<p>On the surface, it looks like a technical switch was flipped. But as a retired lawyer, I can’t help but see the legal fingerprints all over this move. Apple had to disable the blood oxygen feature in the U.S.&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/apple-watch-patent-dispute-sales-ban-masimo-c54d277fad08fdca15576451cb2a600e">after the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that the Watch infringed on Masimo’s patents</a>. To comply, Apple stripped the feature from models sold in the U.S. (Although it remained working in my aging Ultra 1 Apple Watch.)</p>



<p>Now, the feature is back — but not in the way you might expect. Apple re-enabled blood oxygen monitoring with a twist: the Watch collects the data, and the iPhone does the processing.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/blood-oxygen-tracking-is-back-on-the-apple-watch-in-the-us-but-its-now-a-two-device-experience">By moving that piece of the puzzle off the Watch</a>, Apple sidestepped the specific infringement ruling.</p>



<p>This isn’t just engineering — it’s careful legal positioning. The patent claims were tied to how the Watch processed the data. Shift the processing elsewhere, and suddenly Apple isn’t doing the “infringing act” anymore.</p>



<p>For Watch owners, the difference is invisible. You tap your wrist, you get a blood oxygen reading, end of story. For those of us who follow the intersection of tech and law, it’s a fascinating example of how narrow definitions in a ruling can create space for a workaround.</p>



<p>Apple didn’t defy the order. They didn’t give up the feature, either. Instead, they found a precise middle path that kept them compliant and kept customers happy. Whoever cooked up that idea gets a gold star in my book.</p>



<p>The blood oxygen sensor is a valuable addition to the Apple Watch. A few months ago I was feeling sick and scheduled a phone appointment with my doctor. She asked during the call if I had the ability to give her my blood oxygen rate (and I did!). That actually helped figure things out.</p>



<p>As a lawyer, I admire the elegance. As a Watch owner, I’m just glad the feature’s back.</p>
