</ul><h1>Just A Couple</h1><p>We sell a lot of cookware sets on Meh. And just about every time we do, we put together a similar pitch:</p>
<p>Yes, you already have a set of pans. But probably some of them are dinged and dented and scuffed to the point where they’re no longer super effective. And they’re likely pretty old. Also, a bit mismatched.</p>
<p>So why not just replace them all at once?</p>
<p>It’s an airtight pitch, and probably some of you considered it. And then, you saw the price tag, and were like, <em>Yeah, that’s good value for an entire set of cookware. But it’s more than I’m willing to drop just to enjoy a little stylistic continuity in my kitchen. I don’t mind my pots and pans looking different from each other. So I’d prefer to save some money and replace only the one or two pots I need to replace.</em></p>
<p>Which is what we have here.</p>
<p>One or two pots.</p>
<p>As in, you can choose whether to buy either or both of the pots we have on sale today.</p>
<p>And those pots are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A 1.5-quart saucepan with a lid. It’s stainless steel with 3-layer metal construction and a heavy-gauge aluminum core that distributes heat evenly. Also, it’s dishwasher safe and oven safe up to 450 degrees.</li>
</ol>
<p>And…</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>A 3.5-quart saucepan. Same 3-level metal construction, aluminum core, oven safe up to 450, and dishwasher safe. But the neat part? The pot has a spout, and the lid features a built-in strainer. If you’re making pasta or boiling potatoes or whatever, you can just pop the lid and pour the water down the drain when you’re done cooking.</li>
</ol>
<p>And again, you can get one of them, the other, or both together.</p>
<p>As always, remember: these are stainless steel, which is different from nonstick or ceramic-coated cookware. If you’re searing something, let it warm up, add the fat, and then add the (preferably room-temperature) food.</p>
<p>Although, all of this is a bit less important considering these are pots and not frying pans.</p>
<p>Not saying you couldn’t fry an egg in one of these.</p>
<p>Just saying, it’s probably not the best egg-frying implement.</p>
<p>Ending on a negative note! That’s why they pay me the big bucks!</p>
