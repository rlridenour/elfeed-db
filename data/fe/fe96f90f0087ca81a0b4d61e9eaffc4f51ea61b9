As noted <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/23/applecare-theft-and-loss-devices/">by <em>9to5Mac</em>'s Zac Hall</a>, AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss plans will be available for the iPad and Apple Watch starting this Thursday, July 24. These plans are available individually, with no AppleCare One coverage required.<br/>
<br/>
As the name of the plan implies, AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss includes coverage for up to two incidents of theft or loss in a one-year period, in addition to unlimited repairs for accidental damage. In the U.S., the plan starts at &#36;4.99 per month or &#36;49.99 per year for the iPad, and at &#36;2.99 per month or &#36;29.99 per year for the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss was previously limited to the iPhone, with only regular AppleCare+ for repairs offered for the iPad and Apple Watch until now.<br/>
<br/>
AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss is still not available for other devices, such as the Mac, Apple TV, HomePod, AirPods, and Apple Vision Pro. <br/>
<br/>
If you do prefer AppleCare One, theft and loss coverage does apply to any devices that you add to that plan, including the iPad and Apple Watch.<br/>
