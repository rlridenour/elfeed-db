<p>The Pentagon’s inspector general has concluded that US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth put American personnel and their mission at risk by using the encrypted messaging app Signal on his personal phone to share sensitive details of a March strike on Yemen’s Houthi fighters with a small group of senior officials, one of whom was inadvertently Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. Investigators found that the timing of the planned attack, along with information about aircraft, missiles and battle damage assessments, was transmitted in the chat, which the IG said could have endangered troops and compromised operations if intercepted. At the same time, the report, which has been sent to Congress and is expected to be released publicly this week, concluded that Hegseth did not mishandle classification because, as defense secretary, he has authority to decide what information is classified and did not improperly declassify material. The review instead focuses on his violation of Defense Department procedures and records rules, and recommends additional training for senior officials on handling sensitive information over electronic communications. The case has drawn extra attention because it intersects with wider scrutiny of US strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and broader debates over how top officials should balance rapid decision-making with secure, accountable communication.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/9sIDAtvQcaJ11mcDYt-WlTSe4uRCw0jqZeGeWVzoWXm93xbv5EE5kKNPFfztJBMhDGR-fwKKizRvt3D3uwarkHqrYe-aY7m-jrq1FxqToAIj' alt='US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attends a White House cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Signal chat content: Messages in the Signal group included Hegseth discussing plans to kill a specific Houthi leader in Yemen roughly two hours before the covert operation, and then–national security adviser Mike Waltz posting real‑time intelligence on the aftermath of the strikes.</li><li>Disappearing messages: The Atlantic reported that Waltz configured some Signal messages to automatically disappear after one week and others after four weeks, prompting questions about whether federal record‑keeping requirements were undermined.</li><li>Accidental media inclusion: Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly added to the high‑level Signal thread and only later disclosed its existence and contents in an article, initially withholding operational details until the White House publicly insisted no classified information had been shared.</li><li>Personnel consequences: President Trump rejected calls to dismiss Hegseth over the incident but ultimately replaced Waltz as national security adviser, with Trump and other officials attributing more responsibility for the episode to Waltz’s actions in the chat.</li><li>Pentagon response: Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell publicly characterized the inspector general’s findings as a “TOTAL exoneration” and declared the matter “resolved” and “closed,” even as the watchdog’s report faulted Hegseth’s practices and urged better training.</li></ul><blockquote>This matter is resolved, and the case is closed - Sean Parnell, Pentagon spokesperson</blockquote><h3>Perspectives:</h3><ul><li>Pentagon leadership: The Pentagon said the review exonerated Hegseth and stressed in a public statement that the case was considered closed despite the inspector general’s criticism of his communication practices.
