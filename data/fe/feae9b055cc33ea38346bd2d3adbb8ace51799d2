<p>Carl Pullein, one of my time management mentors, thinks we should keep our task managers lean, and therefore free of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>might-do” tasks. Those, he says, belong in our notes app/book.</p>
<p>I see his point, but only half agree.</p>
<p>Capturing might-do tasks into my task manager is convenient so that’s what I do. The <em>On Hold</em> tag I give to this kind of task means they are a resource, not clutter. They show up during weekly and monthly review times and are then either promoted to a more specific time sector, moved to their own notes page in Obsidian, or deleted.</p>
<p>Past me might have used Drafts to append all these might-do ideas to specific files in my Obsidian vault, via tags and the Auto Move plugin. Present me can’t be bothered with all that, and is happy to continue capturing at will and reviewing / moving later.</p>
<p>Next week I’ll be looking in more detail at the time sectors that form a vital foundation for the way I manage tasks. They don’t look exactly Carl’s because I’ve added four more that fit the way I like to work.</p>
<h3 id="news---the-johnny-decimal-workbook-is-now-free">News - the Johnny Decimal Workbook is now free</h3>
<p>John Noble, my digital organisation mentor, has just made his <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/20-29-communication/22-blog/22.00.0148-the-workbook-is-free/" target="_blank">Johnny Decimal Workbook</a>, free. I love this kind of generosity, though I still think the book is worth paying for. He and I can agree to disagree on that one!</p>
<p>The Johnny Decimal Workbook gives you all you need to get your digital files under control, but if you want a head start I wholeheartedly recommend his <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/15-patterns-templates/15.03-life-admin-system/" target="_blank">Life Admin System</a>. I bought the Workbook when it first came out and went through the exercises as written, but found myself overthinking the categories.</p>
<p>Once I downloaded the Life Admin folder it was like a light went on: suddenly it was all clear! I mostly use the system as is, though I’ve deleted some and added other categories to suit my own situation.</p>
<h3 id="disagree-and-curate-your-way-to-a-bespoke-system">Disagree and curate your way to a bespoke system</h3>
<p>Who are your time, task, and digital management mentors? Do you agree with every recommendation they make? Sometimes pre-formed systems (like Johnny’s Life Admin, or Carl’s Time Sectors) are a great foundation, but rarely will an out-of-the-box solution be exactly what you need, without some modifications.</p>
