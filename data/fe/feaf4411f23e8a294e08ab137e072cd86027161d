<p>Needed to find the number of days between two dates. Emacs calendar must know this…</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire up the manual (M-x info-emacs-manual or C-h r).</li>
<li>Info-goto-node (or g).</li>
<li>Type &quot;counting days&quot; and voilá:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>To determine the number of days in a range, set the mark on one date using `C-&lt;SPC&gt;', move point to another date, and type `M-=' (`calendar-count-days-region'). The numbers of days shown is [inclusive]{.underline}; that is, it includes the days specified by mark and point.</p>

<p><em>Note: you can use the mouse to jump to another date, or &quot;g d&quot; (calendar-goto-date).</em></p>
