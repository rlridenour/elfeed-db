<p>In the latest development at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Trump said he will not use military force to obtain Greenland, while still urging “immediate negotiations” on U.S. acquisition of the territory. The remarks marked his clearest public attempt to lower the risk of a military escalation, even as he argued that U.S. control is necessary for national security and NATO’s defense posture in the Arctic. The push has intensified friction with European partners and Denmark, which has publicly rejected talks premised on surrendering sovereignty.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/uiwrDi_5UU2IphPopVFuYSfnaQHRSm2ybuYJsvwCXghBPCEOoPFFSHBqwl6ma91jgYyMu0fcGxBxXJUEEe1Taduqm0_CGZiKhdLdNz6C2v_C' alt='US President Donald Trump speaks at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 21, 2026.' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Tariff pullback: Later Wednesday, Trump said he would cancel planned tariffs on European allies after what he described as a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.</li><li>EU trade pause: The European Parliament suspended work on approving the EU-U.S. trade deal, with its trade committee citing Trump’s Greenland-related threats and saying “business as usual” had become impossible.</li><li>Denmark response: Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said Copenhagen “will not budge an inch” on sovereignty and would not enter negotiations that require abandoning “fundamental principles”.</li><li>NATO signaling: France requested a NATO exercise in Greenland and said it was ready to contribute, framing drills as a way to demonstrate alliance-wide support for Denmark’s sovereignty.</li><li>Arctic footprint: Greenland already hosts about 150 U.S. troops at Pituffik Space Base under the 1951 Greenland Defense Agreement, which allows U.S. forces to move freely on the island.</li></ul><blockquote>“I don’t want to use force.
