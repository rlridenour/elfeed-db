Elon Musk's xAI startup today filed a Texas lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, accusing the two companies of conspiring to "ensure their continued dominance" in the AI market.<br/>

Earlier this month, Musk <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/12/musk-threatens-sue-apple-grok-app-store-rankings/">threatened to sue Apple and OpenAI</a> because his apps X and Grok have not been featured in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>'s "Must Have" apps section, and he has now followed through with that threat.<br/>
<br/>
The lawsuit suggests that Apple was "blindsided by major innovations in AI," leading it to team up with OpenAI "in a desperate bid to protect its smartphone monopoly." xAI points to the integrated ChatGPT feature for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, because &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s ability to reference a chatbot is exclusive to OpenAI as of now.<br/>
<br/>
xAI claims that if <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users want to access a generative AI chatbot, "they have no choice but to use ChatGPT, even if they would prefer to use more innovative and imaginative products like xAI's Grok." xAI says that while &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users can download any chatbot app on their devices, it would not have the same level of "functionality, usability, and integration" as ChatGPT does with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. There is also clear evidence that Apple is working to integrate other chatbots like Gemini into &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, including a statement from Google CEO Sundar Pichai about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/ios-19-google-gemini-integration-likely/">talks on that very subject</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The lawsuit states that Apple has been "deprioritizing" the apps of competing generative AI chatbots and apps like X in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and delaying &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; updates, plus it complains that xAI has not been able to get data from billions of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users for training Grok because it is not integrated with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; like ChatGPT. xAI blames Apple and OpenAI for its failure to "attain more than a few percent of the generative AI chatbot market."<br/>
<blockquote>Despite their high rankings in the subject-matter-based "Top Apps" lists, neither the X app nor the Grok app appeared in the "Must-Have Apps" section of the App Store on August 24, 2025. Instead, as reflected in Figure 5 below, the first 11 listed apps in the "Must-Have Apps" section on August 24, 2025 do not include the X app or the Grok app. Neither the X app nor the Grok app appears further down on the list, either. This is also true of other generative AI chatbot and super app competitors.</blockquote><br/>
xAI asks that the court put a stop to Apple and OpenAI's "anticompetitive scheme" and that the two companies be forced to pay damages.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/grok/">Grok</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/">Twitter</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/25/elon-musk-apple-lawsuit-grok-x/">Elon Musk Sues Apple and OpenAI Over Alleged App Store Conspiracy Against X and Grok</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/elon-musk-sues-apple-and-openai-over-alleged-app-store-conspiracy-against-x-and-grok.2464016/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
