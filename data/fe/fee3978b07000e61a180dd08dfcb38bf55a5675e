<p>In a 1920 <a href="https://archive.org/details/collectedletters0000shaw_k5z1/page/690/mode/2up">letter</a>, George Bernard Shaw wrote, &#8220;The stock joke of the London stage is a fabulous stage direction &#8216;Sir Henry turns his back to the audience and conveys that he has a son at Harrow.'&#8221;</p>
<p>This is perhaps beaten by J.M. Barrie, who <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.209077/page/n219/mode/2up">allegedly</a> told a young actor in one of his plays, &#8220;I should like you to convey when you are acting it that the man you portray has a brother in Shropshire who drinks port.&#8221;</p>
