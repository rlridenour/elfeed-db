Apple is "open" to an acquisition that would accelerate its AI roadmap, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> told <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/apple-aapl-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">CNBC</a></em> today. Cook said that Apple sees AI as one of the "most profound technologies of our lifetime," and that the company is "significantly growing" its AI investments.<br/>

"We're embedding it across our devices, across our platforms and across the company," Cook said. Apple has already purchased seven companies in 2025. "We're open to M&amp;A that accelerates our roadmap," Cook added.<br/>

Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/29/apple-continues-losing-ai-experts-to-meta/">losing key members</a> of its AI team to Meta in recent weeks, and the company is already far behind competitors in AI development.<br/>

Perplexity is valued at &#36;18 billion, so if Apple did acquire the company, it would mark Apple's largest acquisition to date.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/31/apple-open-to-ai-acquisition/">Apple &#039;Open&#039; to Acquisition That Accelerates AI Roadmap</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-open-to-acquisition-that-accelerates-ai-roadmap.2462565/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
