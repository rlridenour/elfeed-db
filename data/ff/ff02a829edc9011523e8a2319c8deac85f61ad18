OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1953893841381273969">today said</a> that the company will allow Plus users to continue to use the prior-generation GPT-4o model if they don't want to use the new GPT-5 model that came out yesterday.<br/>

As noted by <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em>'s <a href="https://joannastern.beehiiv.com/p/gpt-5-and-when-your-favorite-ai-dies-624d9b6db09594e3">Joanna Stern</a>, there were some ChatGPT users who were upset that OpenAI replaced prior ChatGPT models with GPT-5 with no warning. Some people <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/">had become accustomed</a> to the tone and feel of GPT-4o, and did not feel that the GPT-5 model was able to replicate it.<br/>
<br/>
There are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkt8hv/chatgpt_5_is_the_worst_model_ever_feeling_really/">multiple complaints</a> on Reddit about GPT-5's lack of personality compared to GPT-4o, and from people who feel that GPT-5 isn't able to complete the same tasks. Users have also complained about GPT-5 offering replies that are too short, and about hitting usage limits too quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Altman says that Plus users can choose to continue to use 4o, and that OpenAI will watch usage and consider how long legacy models should continue to be supported.<br/>
<br/>
To address the other complaints, GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users will be doubled as the GPT-5 rollout is completed. It is taking longer than expected for OpenAI to deploy GPT-5 to all users, and some people are not yet seeing GPT-5 as an option.<br/>
<br/>
Going forward, GPT-5 should seem smarter, Altman said. There was apparently an issue with the autoswitcher yesterday that caused GPT-5 to seem "way dumber." OpenAI also plans to make it more clear about which model is answering a query, and will update the UI to make it easier to manually trigger thinking. Altman says that OpenAI will continue to listen to user feedback going forward.<br/>

Starting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, the ChatGPT feature that's integrated into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> will use the GPT-5 model. Until then, it will continue to use the prior ChatGPT models. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/08/openai-gpt-5-complaints/">ChatGPT Plus Users Can Keep Using GPT-4o After Complaints About GPT-5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chatgpt-plus-users-can-keep-using-gpt-4o-after-complaints-about-gpt-5.2463033/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
