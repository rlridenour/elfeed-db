<p>In Christopher Marlowe&#8217;s play <em>Edward II</em>, one of the king&#8217;s gaolers receives a message reading <em>Edwardum occidere nolite timere bonum est</em>. This can be read either as <em>Edwardum occidere nolite; timere bonum est</em> (&#8220;Do not kill Edward; it is good to be afraid [to do so]&#8221;) or as <em>Edwardum occidere nolite timere; bonum est</em> (&#8220;Do not be afraid to kill Edward; [to do so] is good&#8221;). The king is killed.</p>
<p>In 1213, John, Archbishop of Esztergom, was pressed to make a statement to Hungarian nobles planning the assassination of Gertrude of Merania. An assassination would have aided the church, but taking a role in it might have imperiled John&#8217;s position and his life. He wrote <em>Reginam occidere nolite timere bonum est si omnes consentiunt ego non contradico</em>, which also has two contradictory meanings depending on its punctuation. <em>Reginam occidere nolite timere; bonum est; si omnes consentiunt, ego non contradico</em> means &#8220;Do not fear to kill the queen, it is right; if everyone agrees, I do not oppose it,&#8221; but <em>Reginam occidere nolite; timere bonum est; si omnes consentiunt, ego non; contradico</em> means &#8220;Do not kill the queen; it is good to fear [doing so]; [even] if everyone agrees, I do not; I oppose it.&#8221; The queen, too, was murdered.</p>
