Sacha Chua has a very nice post on <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/09/adding-org-mode-link-awesomeness-elsewhere-my-org-insert-link-dwim/">using Org links everywhere</a>. Chua really likes the ability to insert links that Org mode provides and wishes she could use it everywhere. It&rsquo;s Emacs so of course she can do that.
</p>
<p>
Her post is a long explanation of how she accomplished that. Being Sacha, she wanted some specific actions depending on the type of link and where it was being inserted. You can read about those rules and the code she uses to accomplish them in her post.

<p>
Her exposition is fairly long and detailed so rather than try to summarize it, I urge you to take a look at her post. If you&rsquo;re interested in the same sort of thing, her code is available in the post itself and from links that she provides.
</p>
<p>
As Chua says, &ldquo;Consistent keybindings mean less thinking.&rdquo; Being able to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>l</kbd> to insert links anywhere—not just in Org buffers—is a real win, especially if you have some bespoke rules as to what the default link description should be.

Chua&rsquo;s post is another example of the customizations that allow her to get so much done but, more importantly, how the flexibility of Emacs allows a user to fine tune Emacs to be exactly what&rsquo;s needed to accomplish the user&rsquo;s workflow with the least effort.</p>
