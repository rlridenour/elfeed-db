<p>In July 1963, Bob Dylan made his first appearance at the Newport Folk Festival. On opening night, he captivated a crowd of 13,000 with a performance of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8pRCi9zS7c">Blowin’ in the Wind</a>,” accompanied by Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, and Peter, Paul, and Mary. Then, the following day, Dylan delivered a rendition of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3UXYJzelk4">With God On Our Side</a>” (a duet with Joan Baez) and performed “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c6_Q5IjU3k">North Country Blues</a>” solo, a song that would later appear on <em>The Times They Are a‑Changin</em>’ in 1964. You can watch these historic performances in original black-and-white footage. (Simply click the links in the text.) Or, thanks to the YouTube channel <em>Toca o Disco</em>, you can experience the moment in color. As a 22-year-old Bob Dylan sings, the audience listens in rapt attention, taking in his powerful folk song about the harsh realities of mining and industrialization. Take note above.</p>
