</ul><h1>Feeling Snacky</h1><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20G12MCVPT420/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&tag=mehdown-20">a 5-star review</a> of these cookies from Amazon, titled “Good stuff isn’t cheap”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t understand any of the reviews saying these are too expensive. We all know good ingredients are not cheap. These cookies are yuuummmmy and they aren’t made of junk. TBH I purchased these partly because of those reviews and I’m glad I did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few things here.</p>
<p>First, interesting that a bunch of people saying something’s overpriced would inspire someone to buy it. Makes us wonder if maybe we’ve been doing this wrong? Should we be buying things in bulk and then selling them for <em>more</em> than Amazon’s price, so that our ire-filled comments might boost our sales among contrarians?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>But, the second point, this ingredients thing? We’re not totally sure we get it. Like, there are claims about clean ingredients that you can pronounce, and that’s cool. But then, looking at the list, they seem like pretty straightforward stuff that you’d expect to find in cookies. We don’t see any organic this, or free-range that, or anything remotely fancy, really. Then again, maybe that’s what makes them “clean”: the fact that it looks like a list of ingredients for cookies, not a list of vendors at a trade show for preservatives and artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>But hey, who cares? Because today, the good stuff <em>is</em> cheap.</p>
<p>The only bummer? At this point, it’s unlikely they’ll arrive for you to hand them out on Halloween. But that’s okay. After all, for an All Hallows’ Eve treat, you’d want a spookier cookie. Something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snicker-BOO-dles</li>
<li>Oatmeal Raisin’ the Deads</li>
<li>Bloody Thumbprints</li>
<li>Pin(head)wheels</li>
<li>Spectraluse Cookies</li>
<li>Shudder Butters</li>
<li>Sandwitch Cookies</li>
<li>Goreos</li>
<li>Killa Wafers</li>
<li>LornaDoomes</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty stupid, right? But these bags of little cookies? They’re not stupid at all. They’re, apparently, pretty good.</p>
