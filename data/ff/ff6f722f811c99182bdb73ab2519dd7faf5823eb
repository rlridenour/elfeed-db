The latest rumors pertain to the iPhone 17 Air and the iPhone 17 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
First, the account Fixed Focus Digital on Chinese social media platform Weibo today <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/Q3BFm5HSS">said</a> the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air is unlikely to launch in China, due to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">lack of a SIM card slot</a>. However, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/08/iphone-17-battery-capacities-allegedly-leaked/">regulatory database listings</a> suggested there would in fact be a variant of the iPhone 17 Air with a SIM card slot, so the situation is unclear. In any case, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to rely entirely on eSIM technology in most countries.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the account Ice Universe on Weibo today <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/Q3E6et4at">reiterated</a> that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be 8.725mm thick, whereas the iPhone 16 Pro Max is 8.25mm thick. If this information is accurate, the iPhone 17 Pro Max would be approximately 5% thicker than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The account previously suggested the device would be thicker in order to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-pro-max-thicker-larger-battery/">accommodate a larger battery</a> with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/08/iphone-17-battery-capacities-allegedly-leaked/">leaked 5,088 mAh capacity</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Both of the Weibo accounts have pretty good track records. We will find out if these rumors prove to be true in around 24 hours from now.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ice-universe/">Ice Universe</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/08/iphone-17-air-and-pro-max-rumors/">Two More iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro Max Rumors Drop Before Apple Event</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/two-more-iphone-17-air-and-iphone-17-pro-max-rumors-drop-before-apple-event.2464854/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
