<p>Israel’s security cabinet approved a package of measures that would expand Israeli authority in the occupied West Bank. The steps include changes reported to make it easier for Jewish Israelis to buy land and to increase Israeli oversight and enforcement in areas where the Palestinian Authority (PA) carries out limited self-rule. Palestinian officials and several international actors said the move would give Israel more control over planning, licensing, and property rules and could amount to de facto annexation in practice, even without a formal declaration. Diplomatic pushback followed quickly. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was “gravely” concerned, and Arab states and the European Union criticized the direction of the decision. In Washington, a White House official reiterated that President Trump opposes Israeli annexation of the West Bank, while arguing that stability there supports Israel’s security and aligns with the administration’s stated goal of pursuing peace in the region.</p><img src='https://kagiproxy.com/img/DkSd9HHJJZgxETextEaTzHcgDxRy-rnXKrCkTVlWsr_SxGlFO-z2s3wdCFhLsMZc0ZUuydvGhSmbcQYjNS9uXCkPH6Kjc8zub_OUVC4dibXzBpCeGSv3E3byuTRT1TvOTZ36HqYgRjvtWJPdHXhz0uWb0wXqemxMQX0CZ3tyQJM6iwC0KP9RMp4WfUuAGaJvmIVcD128t6WTIg' alt='Israeli soldiers on the road to a settler outpost in the occupied West Bank village of Turmus Ayya (October).' /><br /><h3>Highlights:</h3><ul><li>Land purchase: The steps were reported to scrap long-standing restrictions that prevented Jewish private citizens from buying West Bank land directly.
