<p>Excerpts from letters received by the British pensions office, quoted in <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_095295348/page/60/mode/2up"><em>George Lyttelton&#8217;s Commonplace Book</em></a>, 2002:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mrs R. has no clothes, has not had any for many years. The clergy have been visiting her.</li>
<li>In reply to your letter, I have already cohabited with your officers, so far without any result.</li>
<li>You have changed my little boy to a little girl. Will this make any difference?</li>
<li>Please send money at once, as I have fallen in errors with my landlord.</li>
<li>I have no children, as my husband is a bus-driver and works all day and night.</li>
<li>In accordance with your instructions, I have given birth to twins in the enclosed envelope.</li>
<li>I have been in bed with the doctor for a week, and he does not seem to be doing me any good. If things don&#8217;t improve I shall have to get another doctor.</li>
<li>Milk is wanted for the baby, and the father is unable to supply it.</li>
<li>The teeth on top are all right, but the ones in my bottom are hurting terribly.</li>
</ul>
