<p>Notable allusions to unrecorded cases of Sherlock Holmes:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now — though, indeed, it was obvious from the first.'&#8221; (&#8220;The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor&#8221;)</li>
<li>&#8220;&#8216;Farintosh,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Ah, yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson.'&#8221; (&#8220;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&#8221;)</li>
<li>&#8220;&#8216;Here&#8217;s the record of the Tarleton murders and the case of Vamberry, the wine merchant, and the adventure of the old Russian woman, and the singular affair of the aluminium crutch, as well as a full account of Ricoletti of the club foot and his abominable wife.'&#8221; (&#8220;The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual&#8221;)</li>
<li>&#8220;&#8216;He is a big, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy &#8212; something like Aldridge, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair.'&#8221; (The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&#8221;)</li>
<li>&#8220;&#8216;You know that I am preoccupied with this case of the two Coptic Patriarchs, which should come to a head to-day.'&#8221; (&#8220;The Adventure of the Retired Colourman&#8221;)</li>
<li>&#8220;&#8216;We have not forgotten your successful action in the case of Matilda Briggs.&#8217; &#8216;Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson,&#8217; said Holmes, in a reminiscent voice. &#8216;It was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared.'&#8221; (&#8220;The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire&#8221;)</li>
<li>&#8220;A third case worthy of note is that of Isadora Persano, the well-known journalist and duellist, who was found stark staring mad with a matchbox in front of him which contained a remarkable worm, said to be unknown to science.&#8221; (&#8220;The Problem of Thor Bridge&#8221;)</li>
<li>&#8220;&#8216;This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaller, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller.'&#8221; (&#8220;A Case of Identity&#8221;)</li>
<li>&#8220;&#8216;And yet the motives of women are so inscrutable. You remember the woman at Margate whom I suspected for the same reason. No powder on her nose &#8211; that proved to be the correct solution.'&#8221; (&#8220;The Adventure of the Second Stain&#8221;)</li>
<li>&#8220;&#8216;I must thank you&#8217;, said Sherlock Holmes, &#8216;for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases.'&#8221; (<em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em>)</li>
<li>&#8220;Our months of partnership had not been so uneventful as he had stated, for I find, on looking over my notes, that this period includes the case of the papers of ex-President Murillo, and also the shocking affair of the Dutch steamship Friesland, which so nearly cost us both our lives.&#8221; (&#8220;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&#8221;)</li>
