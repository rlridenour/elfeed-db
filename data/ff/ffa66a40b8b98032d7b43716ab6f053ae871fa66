<p>Professor De Cruz worked to expand the boundaries of philosophy beyond its standard academic formats, extending philosophical thinking into art, literature, and music. They were a talented artist, creating the illustrations for forty-two thought experiments in the popular book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Illustrated-Helen-Cruz/dp/0190080531?crid=29QGEHBHM02QT&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.KnYDa5_eljizD9OKOR8KhKx1mPT4y1MYmJmxtGpjfaSbpmpB8GB1UNQbybGk__ILCyhl2QNg2ZydlQZjqqpUeR8XtcJoio2E5A-BAvjyt3RFhMCzFbLdl_Dwu0H-SWR1t1y2RuwYVCQkLE1y7M4sdPrBblo9Q7qRsMzi_EvGg4WCygTr5nmcWJFsThLxZJ9gOZ7CzzjAWVHkfbLba-Ro3O9mHNBm6fpFZuJWtEIfQW8.zlX6B5MNcSEu8Mx0hjXbRwryfQqx2RmMArv4zk4drhQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=philosophy+illustrated&amp;qid=1750262126&amp;sprefix=philosophy+illustrated%2Caps%2C121&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dainou-20&amp;linkId=8c9b875e231236d414b5d397a4476c59&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Philosophy Illustrated</em></a> (2021). They wrote philosophical fiction, including <a href="https://thepinkhydra.itch.io/artistry" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Artistry of Magic</em></a> (2025), and many short stories (and co-edited a <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/philosophy-through-science-fiction-stories-9781350081239/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collection</a> philosophical science fiction stories). They produced a video summary of Margaret Cavendish’s <a href="https://helendecruz.substack.com/p/illustrated-edition-of-margaret-cavendish" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Blazing World</em></a>, for which they also produced the illustrations and music. De Cruz published many essays in popular media outlets and at their newsletter, <a href="https://helendecruz.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Wondering Freely</em></a>. They were extremely active in the philosophical community on social media, and were a longtime contributor to <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Philosophers&#8217; Cocoon</em></a>. In many ways, they showed how to express philosophical ideas in new forms via new avenues to new audiences.</p>
<p>De Cruz joined the faculty at Saint Louis University in 2019. Prior to that, they taught at Oxford Brookes University and VU Amsterdam. They earned a PhD in philosophy from the University of Groningen, and a PhD in archeology from the Free University of Brussels.
