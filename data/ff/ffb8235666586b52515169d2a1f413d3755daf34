         
         <p>Denote aims to be a simple-to-use, focused-in-scope, and effective
note-taking and file-naming tool for Emacs.</p>

<p>Denote is based on the idea that files should follow a predictable and
descriptive file-naming scheme.  The file name must offer a clear
indication of what the contents are about, without reference to any
other metadata.  Denote basically streamlines the creation of such
files or file names while providing facilities to link between them
(where those files are editable).</p>

<p>Denote’s file-naming scheme is not limited to “notes”.  It can be used
for all types of file, including those that are not editable in Emacs,
such as videos.  Naming files in a constistent way makes their
filtering and retrieval considerably easier.  Denote provides relevant
facilities to rename files, regardless of file type.</p>

<p>Below are the release notes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Version 4.0.0 on 2025-04-15</h2>

<p>This is a massive release. There is one breaking change, which should
be easy to adapt to: this pertains to the reorganisation of the
project to separate the “core” of Denote from its “extensions”. The
core is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> package. Each extension now has its own package
(details below).</p>

<p>Other than that, this version includes lots of new features for
searching and linking as well as quality-of-life refinements. We have
generalised the infrastructure for performing queries in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code> and made the buffers with the search results more
useful.</p>

<p>Take your time to read through this publication. I am writing it for
you. Also remember that the most up-to-date resource for anything
related to Denote is its manual. You are always welcome to contact me:
<a href="https://protesilaos.com/contact">https://protesilaos.com/contact</a>. Or join the development on the Git
repository.</p>

<p>As usual, special thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for making high
quality contributions to Denote since the beginning of the project ~3
years ago. Those will not always be headline features, but are
important improvements to the underlying code base.</p>

<p>I mention contributions from Jean-Philippe and others in its context.
Though I do not cover implementation details, otherwise this document
will be the size of a book. This does not mean that they are no
important though. Please consult the Git commit log for all the
technicalities.</p>

<h3>All the “extras” are in separate packages, including the Org dynamic blocks</h3>

<p>In previous versions of Denote, we included some optional extensions
as part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> package. These included the files
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras.el</code> (Org dynamic blocks, among others),
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-extras.el</code> (streamlined for journaling),
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-silo-extras.el</code> (working with multiple Denote silos).</p>

<p>The files <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-md-extras.el</code> (Markdown extras) and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence.el</code> (sequence notes, including Luhmann-style
alphanumeric sequences) were also part of the project during the last
development cycle, though they never made it into a tagged release.</p>

<p>All these are now available as standalone packages on the official GNU
ELPA archive:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org</code>:</strong> In the Emacs configuration file, replace all
instances of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal</code>:</strong> Replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-extras</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-silo</code>:</strong> Replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-silo-extras</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-silo</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-markdown</code> :</strong> Replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-md-extras</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-markdown</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code>:</strong> No changes to any of the defined symbols.
Simply get the new package.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I will document each of these packages further below. The plan, going
forward, is to maintain all the packages and coordinate their new
versions.</p>

<h3>More things in “core”</h3>

<p>While the extras are moved out to their own code repositories, all
other features are merged into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote.el</code>. Those include everything
that was in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort.el</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-buffer.el</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The “sort” mechanism is mostly for package developers. We use it
extensively in our Org dynamic blocks, which are now part of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org</code> package.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired</code> command (alias <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-dired</code>) is the only
user-facing “sort” command we have always provided. It produces a
fully fledged Dired buffer showing the results of the given search
for file names. The matching files are sorted according to the
user’s expressed preference. The details are described in the
manual.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-buffer-mode</code> and all of its user options are
unchanged. This mode automatically renames the buffer of a given
Denote file so that it is easier to read it. Again, the manual
covers the technicalities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Users do not need to make changes, unless they are explicitly loading
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-dired</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-buffer</code>. In that case, they may
just remove those calls: only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> needs to be loaded.</p>

<h3>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-mode</code></h3>

<p>Many of the features I will describe below produce search results via
the built-in Xref mechanism. Xref performs a search with a Grep or
Grep-like program, subject to the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xref-search-program</code>.
The buffer those search results are displayed in runs the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-mode</code>. It supersedes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-backlinks-mode</code>.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-mode</code> supports the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Results are shown in the context, with the exact match in highlight.</li>
  <li>Matches are grouped by file. Each file is a “heading”.</li>
  <li>Headings can be folded with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TAB</code>, just how it is done in Org buffers.</li>
  <li>The results can be used for further queries. Type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-h m</code>
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">describe-mode</code>) to learn about all the relevant commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have had support for Xref since the original version of Denote. It
now is more generalised to cover backlinks, query links, and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-grep</code> (more below).</p>

<h3>Use query links for file contents or file names</h3>

<p>Denote has always provided the option to link directly to a file with
a given name by referencing its identifier. This can be done with the
command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-link</code>, among a few others like it (always consult the
manual of Denote).</p>

<p>In addition to these “direct links”, we also support “query links”.
Those do not point to a file but instead trigger a search. The results
are placed in a buffer that uses the appropriate major mode.</p>

<p>There are two types of query links:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Query file contents:</strong> Use the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-contents-link</code>
to insert a query link at point for “file contents”. It perform a
search inside files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-directory</code> and put the results in
a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-mode</code> buffer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Query file names:</strong> Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-filenames-link</code> to insert
a query link for “file names”. It performs the query against file
names (not contents!) and puts the results in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dired</code> buffer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The display of the buffer with the query link results is controlled by
the user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-links-display-buffer-action</code>.</p>

<p>Query links are styled a little bit differently than direct links.
Compare the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-faces-link</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-faces-query-link</code>. Both
should look okay with most themes.</p>

<p>Denote query links are supported as part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:</code> hyperlink
type. They are available in all file types we define (per the user
option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-file-type</code>) and should, in principle, work in any
custom file type (advanced users can check the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-file-types</code>).</p>

<h3>Backlinks now always show their context</h3>

<p>In the past, the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-backlinks</code> would produce a bespoke
buffer showing a list of file names that included links to the current
file (any file with the Denote file-naming scheme can have backlinks,
by the way, including PDFs, videos, etc.). This buffer did not provide
any additional functionality. We used to support the option to show
results in their context via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-backlinks-show-context</code>. Those
would be rendered in a standard Xref buffer.</p>

<p>The contextual results are now the default and sole option. This is
because we have expanded the functionality of those buffers to use the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-mode</code>, as explained above. Plus, it makes our code base
simpler.</p>

<p>Users will notice how backlikns look just like a query link for file
contents. This is because backlinks are the original query links since
day one of Denote.</p>

<h3>Direct links to a file with matching contents</h3>

<p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-link-to-file-with-contents</code> allows users to
produce a direct link to a file whose contents (not file name!)
includes the given query.</p>

<p>Similarly, the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-link-to-all-files-with-contents</code>
generates a typographic list (bullet list) to all files whose contents
match the given query.</p>

<p>The manual covers all linking commands in depth.</p>

<h3>The essence of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-search</code> is part of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code></h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-search</code> package by Lucas Quintana uses the infrastructure
of Denote to perform searches in file contents. We now provide its
feature set as part of core <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code>.</p>

<p>We decided to do this since query links already introduced all of the
requisite generalisations to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-query-mode</code>.</p>

<p>Users can rely on the commands <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-grep</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-grep-marked-dired-files</code>,
and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-grep-files-referenced-in-region</code>.</p>

<p>The placement of these buffers is subject to the user option
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-grep-display-buffer-action</code>.</p>

<p>This functionality was introduced in two pull requests by Lucas
Quintana, 571 and 573, with further changes by me:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/571">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/571</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/573">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/573</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lucas has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>I think this was a much-needed addition to the core of Denote. It
complements <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired</code> and query links.</p>

<h3>Formatting of links with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-link-description-format</code></h3>

<p>The old user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-link-description-function</code> is deprecated
and superseded by the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-link-description-format</code>. The new
user option still accepts a custom function as its value, so the old
behaviour should be retained.</p>

<p>What the new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-link-description-format</code> supports is an easier
way to customise the description of a link by using format specifiers
for common options. For example, users who only want to see the title
of the linked file can do this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(setq denote-link-description-format "%t")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The documentation of this user option covers all the format specifiers
and further details.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous changes for all users</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-add-front-matter</code> is superseded by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-file</code> and related. Those renaming commands will add
missing front matter or rewrite the modified lines of existing front
matter. This is due to refinements made by Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay
to the file renaming mechanism. We discussed this deprecation in
issue 498: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/498">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/498</a>. Also
thanks to Samuel Flint for reporting an earlier problem with file
name signatures: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/492">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/492</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-open-link-function</code> specifies the function
used by Denote to open the file of a direct link.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-store-link-to-heading</code> can now be set to
form generic context links without a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PROPERTIES</code> drawer and
corresponding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CUSTOM_ID</code>. Set the value of this variable to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'context</code>. Read its documentation for further details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-store-link-to-heading</code>, we have changed its
default value to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, which is what we were doing for most of
Denote’s history. This means that, by default, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org-store-link</code> and
anything building on top of it will create a link only to the
current Denote file, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote:IDENTIFIER</code>, but not to the
current heading within that file. To create links to the
file+heading, set the value of this variable to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'id</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired-link-marked-notes</code> is an alias for
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-link-dired-marked-notes</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The user option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-dired-extra-prompts</code> control what
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-dired</code> (alias <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-dired</code>) prompts for. It accepts
either a nil value or a list of symbols among <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort-by-component</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reverse-sort</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exclude-regexp</code>. The order those symbols appear
in the list is significant, with the leftmost coming first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-identifier-comparison-function</code> variable
which determines how identifier-based sorting should be done by
default. It complements the existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-title-comparison-function</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-keywords-comparison-function</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sort-signature-comparison-function</code>.
Thanks to Maikol Solís for the contribution in pull request 517:
<a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/517">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/517</a>. The change is
small, meaning that Maikol does not need to assign copyright to the
Free Software Foundation (though I believe the paperwork is done, anyway).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lots of refinements to the doc strings of individual variables
and/or functions as well as the manual.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lots of other contributions to discussions and questions on the Git
repository. Granted, these are not “changes” per se but are part of
the development effort nonetheless.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Made <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-get-path-by-id</code> use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-get-file-extension-sans-encryption</code>
instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-get-file-extension</code>. This fixes a bug where the
extension is duplicated if it has an encryption component. Thanks to
eum3l for the patch in pull request 562: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/562">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/562</a>.
The change is small, meaning that the author does not need to assign
copyright to the Free Software Foundation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Same as above for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote--rename-file</code>, which was done in pull
request 557: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/557">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/557</a>.</p>
  </li>

    <p><strong>NEW Function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-file-has-denoted-filename-p</code>:</strong> Return non-nil
if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FILE</code> respects the file-naming scheme of Denote. This tests the
rules of Denote’s file-naming scheme. Sluggification is ignored. It
is done by removing all file name components and validating what
remains. Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the pull request
515: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/515">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/515</a>.</p>

who do not want duplicates should refer to the functions
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-keywords</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MODIFIED Function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-keywords</code>:</strong> Returns an appropriate list

  <li>
    <p><strong>MODIFIED Function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-format-file-name</code>:</strong> Formats a file name.
The way it treats its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ID</code> parameter has changed. Please read its
doc string. Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the pull request
496: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/496">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/496</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>ALIAS Function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-retrieve-filename-keywords-as-list</code>:</strong> This
is a name that is easier to discover than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-extract-keywords-from-path</code>,
because of the many other functions with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-retrieve-*</code> prefix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MODIFIED Function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-retrieve-filename-identifier</code>:</strong> Extracts
the identifier from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FILE</code> name, if present, else returns nil. To
create a new one from a date, refer to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-get-identifier</code>
function. Thanks to Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the pull request

  <li>
    <p><strong>MODIFIED Function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-date-prompt</code>:</strong> Prompts for a date,
expecting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD</code> or that plus <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HH:MM</code> (or even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HH:MM:SS</code>).
Can also use Org’s more advanced date selection utility if the user
option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-date-prompt-use-org-read-date</code> is non-nil. It now has
the optional parameters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INITIAL-DATE</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PROMPT-TEXT</code>. Thanks to

to construct new front matter values if appropriate. If
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-rename-confirmations</code> contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rewrite-front-matter</code>,
prompt to confirm the rewriting of the front matter. Otherwise
produce a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y-or-n-p</code> prompt to that effect. Thanks to
Jean-Philippe Gagné Guay for the pull request 558:

<h3>Denote “extensions” that are not in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code> package anymore</h3>

<h4><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal</code> integrates nicely with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M-x calendar</code></h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">calendar</code> can now highlight days that have journal entry. It may
also be used as a date picker to view or write a journal entry for
that day.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Thanks to Alan Schmitt for reporting an issue with the calendar
integration during development:

    <p>Thanks to Vineet C. Kulkarni for tweaking the identification of the
journal keyword to be more robust:

    <p>Thanks to Honza Pokorny for fixing two small issues with the path

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other than that, the package is providing the same functionality as
the discontinued <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-journal-extras.el</code>.</p>

<h4><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org</code> is almost the same as the discontinued <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org-extras.el</code></h4>

<p>The only addition to dynamic blocks the optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:not-regexp</code> parameter.
This is a regular expression that can further filter the results of a
search, such that the matching items are removed from the output.</p>

<p>The official manual of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-org</code> covers the technicalities.</p>

<ul>

  <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-org">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote-org</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also thanks to Elias Storms for fixing a small issue with the “missing
links” Org dynamic block, in pull request 486: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/486">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/pull/486</a></p>

<h4><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-silo</code> is the same as the discontinued <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-silo-extras.el</code></h4>

<p>I have only made small tweaks to it, but nothing that changes the user
experience.</p>

<ul>

<h4><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-markdown</code> for some Markdown-specific extras</h4>

<p>This package provides some convenience functions to better integrate
Markdown with Denote. This is mostly about converting links from one
type to another so that they can work in different applications
(because Markdown does not have a standardised way to define custom
link types). It also defines an “Obsidian” file type which does not
have any front matter but only uses a level 1 heading for the title of
the note.</p>

<p>The code of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-markdown</code> used to be bundled up with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote</code>
package before version <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4.0.0</code> of the latter and was available in the
file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-md-extras.el</code>. Users of the old code will need to adapt
their setup to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-markdown</code> package. This can be done by
replacing all instances of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-md-extras</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-markdown</code>
across their configuration.</p>

</ul>

<h4>Write sequence notes (or “folgezettel”) with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code></h4>

<p>Users who want their notes to have an inherent structure can use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-sequence</code>. The idea is to have thoughts that naturally form
sequences and are named accordingly. The sequence scheme is either
numeric or alphanumeric. The manual of the package explains all the
details.</p>

</ul>

<p>I had a lot of fun developing this comprehensive package during the
winter holidays.</p>

<p>Thanks to Claudio Migliorelli, Kierin Bell, Mirko Hernandez for
helping me fix some issues during development:</p>

<h3>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote</code> also gets a small update</h3>

<p>This has always been a standalone package. I made the function
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">consult-denote-file-prompt</code> read the special-purpose variable
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-file-prompt-use-files-matching-regexp</code>. This is related to
commit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e0f1d47</code> in denote.git, about issue 536 as reported by Alan
Schmitt: <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/536">https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/536</a>. The
variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">denote-file-prompt-use-files-matching-regexp</code> is meant to be
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> bound and is for advanced users or developers.</p>

<h3>Feature freeze at least until the end of April 2025</h3>

<p>I will not develop new features or accept pull request for a couple of
weeks. The idea is to focus on fixing any bug reports. We can then
publish point releases quickly.</p>

<p>New features can be included after we are confident that the packages
we have are okay.</p>

<h3>Git commits</h3>

<p>This is just an overview of the Git commits, though remember that
there is more that goes into a project, such as the reporting of
inconsistencies, discussion of new ideas, et cetera. Thanks to
everybody involved! Plus, some commits are large while others are
tiny.</p>
