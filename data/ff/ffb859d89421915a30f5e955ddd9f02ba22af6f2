<p>I&rsquo;m excited to offer the next giveaway, 5 licenses ($80 combined value each) for <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things for Mac and iOS</a>. That&rsquo;s right, another chance at Things! Things is a task management solution that I love for its elegance. Display your todos alongside calendar events, see exactly what you have to do <em>today</em>, see upcoming tasks, and break large projects down into manageable pieces. This giveaways gets you 3 licenses, one each for Mac, iPhone, and iPad.</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Things makes it easy. Within the hour, you&rsquo;ll have everything off your mind and neatly organized &mdash; from routine tasks to your biggest life goals &mdash; and you can start focusing on what matters today.</p>
</blockquote>
