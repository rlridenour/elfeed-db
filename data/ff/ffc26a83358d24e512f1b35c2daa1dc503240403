<p>In the latest development, President Trump said Iran’s leaders have reached out to seek negotiations even as he says the U.S. military is reviewing “very strong” options amid a deadly crackdown on mass protests in Iran. Rights groups and activists cited by multiple outlets report protest-related deaths in the hundreds, though exact totals vary because of an internet and communications blackout and the difficulty of verification.
