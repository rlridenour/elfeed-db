Apple's next-generation Studio Display is expected to arrive early next year, and a new report allegedly provides a couple more details on the external monitor's capabilities.<br/>

According to internal Apple code seen by <em><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3007295/apple-studio-display-2-leak-reveals-promotion-hdr-a19-chip-upgrades.html">Macworld</a></em>, the new external display will feature a variable refresh rate capable of up to 120Hz – aka ProMotion – as well as support for HDR content. The current Studio Display is limited to 60Hz and supports SDR, but not HDR. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Macworld</em>'s Filipe Espósito suggests new HDR support points to Apple's use of improved panel technology that can achieve higher brightness. Indeed, analyst Ross Young believes Apple's next Studio Display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">could use a mini-LED panel</a> similar to the MacBook Pro, which features superior brightness, contrast, and color accuracy compared to the existing LCD panel. <br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, the code references a "J527" identifier for the monitor, and suggests the model is powered by the A19 chip – two details that have also been previously discovered in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/">code reviewed by <em>MacRumors</em></a>. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has also referenced "J527" as the internal codename for one of the displays that Apple is developing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the 27-inch Studio Display in March 2022 alongside the Mac Studio. It features a 5K resolution, 600 nits of brightness, built-in webcam and speakers, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. Pricing in the U.S. starts at &#36;1,599. The new version Apple is developing could arrive as early as this spring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/11/apple-studio-display-2-early-next-year/">alongside new Macs with M5 chips</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77">Mac Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/">Apple Studio Display 2 Code Hints at 120Hz ProMotion, HDR, A19 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-studio-display-2-code-hints-at-120hz-promotion-hdr-a19-chip.2474522/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>
