My darling wife, Sheri, is watching the PBS version of Jane Austen’s  <i>Northanger Abbey</i> this evening. I have a set of wireless headphones that I call the “Jane Austen Specials” to wear at such times. Unfortunately, I didn’t make sure that they were charged this afternoon. A great mistake on my part.
