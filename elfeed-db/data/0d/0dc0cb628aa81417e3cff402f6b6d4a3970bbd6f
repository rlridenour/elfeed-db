We say that God helps those who help themselves, <br></br>
that cleanliness is next to godliness, <br></br>
that money is the root of all evil, <br></br>
that God will not give us more than we can handle, <br></br>
and that he works in mysterious ways.
</p>

 <p>
Father,
</p>

 <p>
Open our eyes to the Scripture you have given us, <br></br>
and free us from the temptation <br></br>
to turn it into the one that we want.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
