<p><time datetime="2025-01-16" title="2025-01-16">On Thursday</time> <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2025/01/16/creative-questions-challenge/">James put forward the following Creative Questions</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What creative activities do you do often?</li>
<li>What creative activities would you like to do more often?</li>
<li>What environments do you like to create in? How does this differ between the
different creative things you do? (i.e. do you prefer different environments
when you write vs. play music)</li>
<li>Do you have a consistent time that you make things, or do you prefer to go
with the flow?</li>
<li>How much time do you spend taking notes and gathering inspiration before you
make something new?</li>
<li>What does the term “creative practice” mean to you?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-creative-activities-do-you-do-often">What Creative Activities Do You Do Often?</h2>
<p>Reading, writing, walking, and conversing.</p>
<p>I’m trying to commit to 90 minutes of active personal reading a day. And that
means ensuring that I have access to reading material in the moments in between.
I’ll carry a book in my pocket to ensure that I can dip into that.</p>
<p>Then there’s writing. This is a passion of mine. A chance to think and
remember. I keep my writing tools sharpened, and am always tending to my
writing process.</p>
<p>I love the act of re-incorporating conversational themes back into
conversations. Just a gentle nudge, a reminder that I’m listening, but also a
bit of playfulness (as in a riddle) to see how the other person picks up the
hint.</p>
<p>These conversations are especially rewarding when you have folks that are
generally curious; and with whom you have overlap in knowledge and experience,
but also notable differences.</p>
<p>And walking, well that’s one thing I would like to do more of.</p>
<h2 id="what-creative-activities-would-you-like-to-do-more-often">What Creative Activities Would You like to Do More Often?</h2>
<p>Drawing and gardening. And definitely walking.</p>
<p>I remember reading about an author—Eudora Welty, if memory serves—who would go
on walks to tap into creativity. Their process was to walk away until they were
tired, and then walk back. And in that walk back, they found clarity and
serendipity in that which they were working at creating.</p>
<p>For awhile, I was writing a lot of my notes on paper, and I decided to start
doodling in the margins. I loved layering the creative exercises. However, I
also appreciate using a computer for writing (especially as it relates for
gathering certain types of catalysts for writing).</p>
<p>But that’s not enough drawing. However, to draw, I need a bit of space; which
I’m eagerly awaiting and planning.</p>
<p>Gardening is something I’ve only dabbled in. But when I have, and given it my
focus, I’ve found the act of weeding and tending the garden to be meditative and
revelatory.</p>
<h2 id="what-environments-do-you-like-to-create-in">What Environments Do You like to Create In?</h2>
<p>I like to write with minimal background distractions; maybe I’ll listen to
music, but if there’s talking happening, I struggle. Meaning, I try to find a
space without a television belching noise and moving pictures into my field of
hearing and vision.</p>
<p>I also appreciate having a small desk. Where I can have a book and laptop open
alongside a small paper journal.<small class="side-container">

<h2 id="when-do-you-create">When Do You Create?</h2>
<p>I create throughout the day. Before I start my day job, I will read my news
feed. Which will kick off some writing. Then, as the clock strikes the working
hour, I switch over to creating software.</p>
<p>At lunch, I’ll maybe read a poem or three; at my best, I’ll transcribe a few
lines from those poems and maybe write a reflection. I’ll also get outside and
throw frisbee with my dogs. And if the mood strikes and the light is good, I’ll
snap a few photos.</p>
<p>Then back to the software creation process; which involves creative thinking and
problem solving. And remembering.</p>
<p>When the clock strikes quitting time, I’ll again head outside with the dogs.
We’ll play a bit and I’ll start preparing dinner. Nothing complicated, favoring
roasted or sauteed vegetables.</p>
<p>As the evening deepens, I’ll set back to relax. Maybe read some more. Or graze
on posts from the Fediverse.</p>
<p>The time outside with my dogs, I’ll look and listen for birds and how the light
catches the snow or a leaf. There I might draw inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-time-do-you-spend-taking-notes">How much time do you spend taking notes?</h2>
<p>Aside from my reading of books, I try to do most of my “intake” through <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
.
I leverage <span>Emacs</span>
to help capture notes and their sources. And continue to
refine and alter that process as I understand how things are “working” for me.</p>
<p>In other words, whenever I’m “computering”, I’m always a keystroke away from
taking notes right beside my “computering” subject.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-term-creative-practice-mean-to-you">What does the term “creative practice” mean to you?</h2>
<p>To me, “creative practice” is not the output of a creative endeavor, but instead
how you go about your creative endeavors. And reflect on those endeavors and
adjust as you seek to explore the “how” you do things.</p>
