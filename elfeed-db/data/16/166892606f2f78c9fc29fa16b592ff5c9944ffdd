<li>They keep cans cold</li>
<li>16oz cans, 12oz cans, tall skinny seltzer cans–they work with all of them</li>
<li>They keep cans from spilling (you can seal them)</li>
<li>They keep everyone from knowing what you’re drinking</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but they can make a canned margarita cold and delish</li>
</ul><h1>Cold Concealer</h1><p>The main two selling points for these things are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>They keep canned beverages colder for longer. A lot longer. And, like a koozie on steroids, they also keep your hands from getting too cold while you hold said beverage.</li>
</ol>
<p>And…</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>They keep canned beverages protected. You can seal them to prevent leaks or spills. Which is neat because there’s nothing worse than a tipped can making a big mess! (Not to mention, you just lost a perfectly good drink.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds great, right?</p>
<p>But there is an oft-overlooked third selling point which might be the most appealing of all:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>They conceal canned beverages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are we saying you should put a hard seltzer in one of these to drink on the bus to work?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You could, however, use one to hide your unimpressive taste.</p>
<p>Or, you know, to save face while saving a little money, if you buy some not-so-great can brands. And we’re not talking generic store brands here.</p>
<p>We’re talking about those canned beverages that openly admit they’re not the best. Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>La Croix-Vey</li>
<li>Dudweiser</li>
<li>Coro-nah</li>
<li>Pabst Honorable Mention</li>
<li>So-so Chico</li>
<li>Milwaukee’s Rest</li>
<li>Twisted Mediocri-Tea</li>
<li>Mountain Ewww</li>
<li>Sierra Miss</li>
<li>Actually Just Your Grandfather’s Root Beer</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, pretty stupid, we know. But these Can Keepers aren’t.</p>
<p>And it’s almost, if not already, outdoor beverage season, so get them now and enjoy using them for the next few months.</p>
