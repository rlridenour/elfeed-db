Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
You call us into the night, <br></br>
into the darkness, <br></br>
to a place without distraction <br></br>
where we can see only ourselves, <br></br>
not as we wish we were, <br></br>
but as we truly are.
</p>

 <p>
We come hesitantly, <br></br>
for we are afraid <br></br>
to acknowledge <br></br>
what we have become.
</p>

 <p>
We come trembling, <br></br>
knowing that hearts <br></br>
that are hard <br></br>
must somehow be broken.
</p>

 <p>
We come with hope, <br></br>
knowing that what <br></br>
is broken can <br></br>
again be made whole <br></br>
by the unending <br></br>
love of God.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
