Lord Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
You warned the disciples <br></br>
to be wary of claims <br></br>
that the messiah had come. <br></br>
You said, “When told <br></br>
he is in the inner rooms, <br></br>
do not believe it.”
</p>

 <p>
When Thomas was told <br></br>
that you appeared <br></br>
in the inner rooms, <br></br>
he heeded your word <br></br>
and did not believe it <br></br>
until he saw for himself.
</p>

 <p>
And of those who claim <br></br>
to have special insight <br></br>
of your will for us, <br></br>
may we be like Thomas, <br></br>
the skeptical and <br></br>
obedient disciple.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
