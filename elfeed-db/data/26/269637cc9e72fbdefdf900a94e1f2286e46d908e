A hundred mile journey <br></br>
from Nazareth to Bethlehem, <br></br>
taken at the whim <br></br>
of the emperor. <br></br></p>

 <p>
And two people, <br></br>
who never counted to Caesar, <br></br>
walked for days <br></br>
to be counted by Caesar.
</p>

 <p>
But Caesar rested easily in his palace, <br></br>
not feeling the earth tremble <br></br>
as the weight of the universe <br></br>
was laid in a manger.
</p>
