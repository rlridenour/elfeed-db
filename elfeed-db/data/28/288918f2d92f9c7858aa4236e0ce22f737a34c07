God of grace,
</p>

 <p>
On the door of the church, <br></br>
Luther proclaimed his message,
</p>

 <p>
“The true treasure of the church <br></br>
is the most holy gospel <br></br>
of the glory and grace of God.”
</p>

 <p>
A treasure too great <br></br>
to be kept to ourselves, <br></br>
yet why is that <br></br>
we who have received <br></br>
so much grace somehow <br></br>
seem to have so little <br></br>
left to offer?
</p>

 <p>
Forgive me, Lord, <br></br>
and let me never again <br></br>
confuse your river of grace <br></br>
with the cesspool of <br></br>
my self-righteousness.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
