Prayer for an evening of frantic packing before a trip to Africa. I’ll be teaching philosophy of religion at a Baptist seminary in Ghana for the next two weeks.
</p>

 <p>
Lord,
</p>

 <p>
If I really need it, <br></br>
help me to remember to pack it.
</p>

 <p>
If I really don’t need it, <br></br>
help me to resist the temptation to take it.
</p>

 <p>
And if I need it and forget it, <br></br>
may it be something I would have lost over there anyway.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
