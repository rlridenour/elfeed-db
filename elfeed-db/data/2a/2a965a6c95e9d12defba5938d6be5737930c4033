Another thought-provoking sermon at  <a href="http://northhavenchurch.net">NorthHaven</a> this week - this time, from Bryan Partridge. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Here is the prayer for the week:
</p>


 <p>
A good actor devotes herself to her role, <br></br>
and carefully learns her lines; <br></br>
while constantly studying the finest <br></br>
performances of the past. <br></br> <br></br>
At first, after many missed cues <br></br>
and fumbled lines, <br></br>
she fears she may never get it right. <br></br> <br></br>
But with wise direction, <br></br>
and hours of rehearsing, <br></br>
every word, <br></br>
and every gesture, <br></br>
eventually seems natural, <br></br>
as if she has finally become <br></br>
what she was always meant to be. <br></br> <br></br>
And the role, <br></br>
performed countless times by others, <br></br>
is now hers, <br></br>
something new, <br></br>
and beautiful - <br></br> <br></br>
A work of art <br></br>
taken to the stage, <br></br>
and performed for the pleasure <br></br>
of the audience. <br></br> <br></br> <br></br>
Father, <br></br> <br></br>
We place ourselves <br></br>
under your direction, <br></br>
as we seek to grow <br></br>
into this role, <br></br>
which you have given us - <br></br>
to be disciples of Christ. <br></br> <br></br>
And with time, <br></br>
may we each create something <br></br>
unique and beautiful <br></br>
for your good pleasure. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
