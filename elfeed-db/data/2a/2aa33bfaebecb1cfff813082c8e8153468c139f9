Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
You found a man living in a cemetery, <br></br>
bound by chains that he did not forge, <br></br>
forced on him by people who were afraid.
</p>

 <p>
I, too, am bound in chains, <br></br>
some forged by ignorance, <br></br>
every link a failure to recognize <br></br>
your image in another human.
</p>

 <p>
Others forged by arrogance, <br></br>
of thinking that there are those <br></br>
not fit for your kingdom, <br></br>
or for your service.
</p>

 <p>
Still others forged by fear, <br></br>
the fear of rejection, <br></br>
the fear of difference.
</p>

 <p>
You who created the world <br></br>
in all of its diversity <br></br>
and declared it to be good,
</p>

 <p>
Free me from the arrogant presumption <br></br>
of thinking that I would have done better.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
