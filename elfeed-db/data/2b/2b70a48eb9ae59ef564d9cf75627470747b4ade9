<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Some reflections the year ending: life changes, readings, and writings.
</p>
<p>I consider myself very fortunate, for the last 20 years I have had paid time off
between Christmas and New Years Day. As such I have more time and mental space
to write. Especially with such early sunsets.<small class="side-container">

<h2 id="major-life-events">Major Life Events</h2>
<p>I remain in good health, enjoying long walks to help clear my mind and creating
opportunities such that lead to

<p>Other events and happenings:</p>
<ul>
<li>My step-daughter graduated college and moved to Chicago.</li>
<li>We sold our large house in northern Indiana and bought a smaller one in
southern Michigan.</li>
<li>I changed jobs in <time datetime="2024-04-29" title="2024-04-29">late April</time>.</li>
<li>We started and are wrapping up a major renovation project.</li>
<li>We lived with my in-laws for a several months.</li>
<li>We saw (during <time datetime="2024-12-26" title="2024-12-26">Christmas week</time>) at the same time three of my children and their
partners. This is an unprecedented miracle.</li>
<li>I started writing a daily journal—in <span><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" title="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ORG-MODE">&#128214;</a></small>
of course.</li>
<li>I’ve thrown a frisbee with my dogs approximately 35,000 times this year.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="moving">Moving</h3>
<p>At the beginning of <time datetime="2024-01" title="2024-01">2024</time> we weren’t planning on moving. Instead we were
thinking about a trip to celebrate Jenny’s birthday. But, when a place came up
near enough to our current home we gave a look.</p>
<p>That house wasn’t right, but set us in motion. We had constraints, namely not
moving too far from Goshen, as all of our parents—all of whom are healthy but in
their 70s—live in Northern Indiana. Something showed up near friends, so we
jumped.</p>
<p>All while my step-daughter was wrapping up university. Here she was, moving
back for a moment before moving to Chicago; immediately needing to sort through
her childhood as we wouldn’t have room at our new place.</p>
<p>While she was back for <time datetime="2024-12-25" title="2024-12-25">Christmas</time>, I asked how she was doing having so hastily
losing her home base. She said it was odd, not having a place to crash after
meeting up with friends.</p>
<h3 id="settling-in">Settling In</h3>
<p>We haven’t moved in yet, but the time draws close. Its odd to be wanting to
wish towards the arrival of the middle of January, knowing the national chaos
and pain on the looming horizon.</p>
<p><time datetime="2024-12-27" title="2024-12-27">Yesterday</time> I read <cite data-id="EE118160-C498-4C08-BD30-4589C55F6894"><a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/machiavelli-and-the-emergence-of-the-private-study/">Here I Gather All My Friends</a></cite>; prompting me to think about how I might setup my own study.
I have some ideas, but don’t know the reality of our space.</p>
<p>In our previous house, I had a study, but rarely used it. Why? Because it was
on a different floor from where we spent our waking hours. Which has me
thinking about <cite data-id="6DA6D508-9DB5-42D4-A105-6DBD83C309E5">On Writing</cite> by Stephen King, in which he eventually setup his
writing station in the family living area.</p>

<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="20221009T120443">
<p>
If being human is to mean anything at all in the Anthropocene, if we are going
to refuse to let ourselves sink into the futility of life without memory, then
we must not lose our few thousand years of hard-won knowledge, accumulated at
great cost and against great odds. We must not abandon the memory of the dead.

<p>With the accelerating regurgitation of the voracious consumptive “<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction">Artificial Intelligence</a></span> (<abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Artificial Intelligence”" title="Other site-wide references of “Artificial Intelligence”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-AI">&#128214;</a></small>)
” and the
election of the 47th president of the United States, I’m cognizant of the
fragile nature truth. Of shared knowledge.</p>
<p>As such I’ve been working to broaden my reading, seeking to bolster foundations.
I’m also setting aside time each day to read; my goal is 90 minutes, with a mix
of poetry, literature, essays, and non-fiction. This has meant paying attention
to time sinks: namely Mastodon and refreshing my <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" title="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-RSS">&#128214;</a></small>

progress.</p>
<p>I finished the following books, which compared to other years, is a rather
short-list:</p>

<p>One thing I’m falling further in love with is a book’s introduction. Timothy
Snyder’s introduction in <cite data-id="26A608F1-70C2-4E23-9DA0-B2C978D5BB52">The Power of the Powerless</cite> laid excellent ground work
to help me receive Václav Havel’s writing; whom I (re-)learned about in <cite data-id="FB27689F-EFB6-4C17-A9B9-D4759FC2572F">Why Orwell Matters</cite>; a book that I think will be amongst my most important reads.</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2024/">My Posts for 2024</a> summarizes the “stats” for the year. I’m proud of the 12
<a href="https://takeonrules.com/tags/poetry">poetry posts I wrote</a>. I definitely did not keep up with the <span><a href="https://spriggans-den.com/2023/12/10/lore-24/">Lore24</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Lore24”" title="Other site-wide references of “Lore24”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-LORE24">&#128214;</a></small>
challenge.</p>
<p>And I’m finding that with my practice of regular writing, I’m able to write
posts in less time. The quick ones are those where I write about extending
<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
. I’ve done the work so I use writing as my time to both synthesize and
share that work.</p>
<p>But I’m also finding other posts flow a bit smoother. I suspect some of this
comes from being more deliberate with my attention. I deleted my Facebook
account. I continue to run aggressive ad-blocking in my browser; or favor the
text based browser to minimize distractions.</p>
<p>I have also established a strong separation between my work and personal life.
Namely when I’m wrapping up at work, I close my work laptop and write on paper
my tasks for the next day. That ritual of writing ensures that I’m not
ruminating on those software tasks during my evening hours.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Aside from aiming for 90 minutes of reading a day, I’m not going to commit to
any challenges or resolutions for <time datetime="2024" title="2024">2025</time>. I will however, continue to work to
learn and grow my empathy and community.</p>
