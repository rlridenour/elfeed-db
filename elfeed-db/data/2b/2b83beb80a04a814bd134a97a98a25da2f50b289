Even though I fear the answer, <br></br>
I must still ask the question <br></br>
that was posed <br></br>
by the one who betrayed the Lord. <br></br> <br></br>
“Am I the one?” <br></br> <br></br>
Am I the one who <br></br>
sat in the comfort <br></br>
of the palace of the High Priest <br></br>
to plot your death <br></br>
because you were a threat <br></br>
to my religious authority? <br></br> <br></br>
Am I the one who <br></br>
from the confines of another palace <br></br>
washed my hands of you, <br></br>
preferring instead the <br></br>
power and prestige <br></br>
of my position? <br></br> <br></br>
Or am I the one <br></br>
who denied any <br></br>
knowledge of you, <br></br>
fearing what might happen <br></br>
if I should follow you to the cross? <br></br> <br></br>
Might I be the one <br></br>
full of sorrow, <br></br>
but devoid of hope, <br></br>
who wept in your presence, <br></br>
and watched you die? <br></br> <br></br>
On this day, <br></br>
Lord Jesus, <br></br>
We are all of these. <br></br> <br></br>
Put in our hands a crown of thorns, <br></br>
and show us again what Love can make <br></br>
with two pieces of wood and a few nails. <br></br> <br></br>
Christ have mercy on us, <br></br> <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
