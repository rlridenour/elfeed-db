A prayer for Mitch Randall’s last Sunday as pastor of NorthHaven Church, before he takes his new position as executive director of the Baptist Center for Ethics.
</p>

 <p>
God of peace and joy,
</p>

 <p>
For centuries, <br></br>
Israel anticipated <br></br>
the coming of the Messiah; <br></br>
and as one expectation <br></br>
was fulfilled, <br></br>
another was born, <br></br>
for we still long <br></br>
for the day when <br></br>
that same Messiah <br></br>
will come again.
</p>

 <p>
Christmas is still a day <br></br>
when old dreams are fulfilled, <br></br>
and new dreams are born.
</p>

 <p>
We give thanks for what <br></br>
this church has become <br></br>
in the years that Mitch <br></br>
has been with us:
</p>

 <p>
For those who have <br></br>
been rejected, <br></br>
it is a place to feel welcome.
</p>

 <p>
For those who have <br></br>
felt constrained, <br></br>
a place to be free.
</p>

 <p>
For those whose gifts <br></br>
have been denied, <br></br>
a place to serve.
</p>

 <p>
And so it is fitting <br></br>
that at Christmas <br></br>
We share with the world. <br></br>
this gift that we have received,
</p>

 <p>
And may we, through our <br></br>
words, actions, and gifts, <br></br>
declare to the world <br></br>
that there is still <br></br>
good news of glad tidings, <br></br>
for all people, everywhere.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
