Reflecting on a “room of my own” as well as my processes of gathering information.

Reading is a form of necromancy, a way to summon and commune once again with the
dead.

<p><time datetime="2024-12-29" title="2024-12-29">Earlier this week</time>, I was painting a basement closet that is enclosed by the
stairs leading to the main floor. Having just read <cite data-id="EE118160-C498-4C08-BD30-4589C55F6894"><a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/machiavelli-and-the-emergence-of-the-private-study/">Here I Gather All My Friends</a></cite> I found myself
thinking about the following:</p>
<blockquote class="h-cite" cite="https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/machiavelli-and-the-emergence-of-the-private-study/">
On the ceiling beams of his library, Montaigne has inscribed ancient
maxims and biblical proverbs in Greek and Latin. These inscriptions form
a sort of architectural commonplace book, a thesaurus or database gleaned
from his vast readings which he would redeploy in his writings.

<h2 id="home-again">Home Again</h2>
<p>This <time datetime="2024-07" title="2024-07">past summer</time> we sold our large house in the country and bought a smaller
house. With our children fledged, we didn’t need all of that space.</p>
<p>In that big house, we had a preponderance of rooms. One of those rooms was a
study that I rarely used. Why? For the first two years of the COVID-19
Pandemic, I worked there each day. As I settled into working from home I
stopped using that study; in part to be with my dogs, but also because it was on
a separate floor from most of our living.</p>
<p>For those first few months after moving, my wife, our two dogs, and myself
lived in 700 square feet of our new house. Then we began repairing and
renovating. And as that project draws to an end we’re painting rooms. And the
last to paint is the closet under the stairs.</p>
<p>Which had me thinking about a study. Not one where I work my day job, but one
where I think my personal thoughts. I could write upon those walls under the
stairway. There are a few shelves for books (though likely canned goods).</p>
<p>This all is me dreaming of our new space; how I might establish rituals of
personal thought and bibliomancy. We’ve already established that the spare
bedroom on the main floor will be my wife’s art room; a room of her own, as
Virginia Woolf demands.</p>
<h2 id="improving-habits">Improving Habits</h2>
<p>I think on this, as the <time datetime="2024" title="2024">year</time> draws to a close and a <time datetime="2025" title="2025">new year</time> begins its birthing
contractions. I want to prioritize protecting my attention, and thus being
favoring proactivity instead reactivity.</p>
<p>I plan to do this by creating better patterns of information intake and
synthesis and sharing. To help best prepare me to steward my energy for
weathering an ever escalating shit storm.</p>
<p>One step I’ve done is bidding
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2024/11/17/farewell-to-facebook/">Farewell to Facebook</a></cite>. Another is to reduce
doom-scrolling opportunities; in <a href="http://takeonrules.com/2024/10/31/hacking-on-mastodon-emacs-package-to-narrow-viewing/">Hacking on Mastodon Emacs Package to Narrow
Viewing</a>, I created a process to see one post at a time. This is done by
fetching 50 then narrowing to show one at a time.</p>
<p>When I get to the end of the 50 posts, I call it good enough. Also each post
gets my full attention. I have two primary threads I read through:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Personal timeline</dt>
<dd>people I follow.</dd>
<dt>Hash tags</dt>
<dd>I have a function that fetch the first 50 posts that match one of
six tags.</dd>

<h3 id="one-minor-improvement">One Minor Improvement</h3>
<p>I’m also ever refining how I capture information.</p>
<p><time datetime="2024-12-31" title="2024-12-31">Today</time>, I created an <span><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" title="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ORG-MODE">&#128214;</a></small>
capture template for “Dictionary”:</p>
<pre><code class="language-emacs-lisp">(&quot;d&quot; &quot;Dictionary&quot;
plain (file
jf/path/to/dictionary)
&quot;- %^{Term} :: %^{Description}; %a&quot;
:after-finalize jf/org/capture/dictionary/sort)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, as I stumble upon a new to me word, I can take a moment to capture a word I
learned. And then automatically sort the entries in that dictionary. It’s a
small improvement that helps me reinforce my learning.</p>
<p>This new capture is useful but also a reminder to think of how I can digitally
retain things I find. Because, as search engines eat “<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction">Artificial Intelligence</a></span> (<abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Artificial Intelligence”" title="Other site-wide references of “Artificial Intelligence”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-AI">&#128214;</a></small>)
” generated crap,
finding things will grow harder.</p>
<p>So I collect full content for possible future reference; one that I can index
via local processes. Much as I gather physical books. In days and years ahead,
I’ll consult these catalysts during the communing rituals.</p>
