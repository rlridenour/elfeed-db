After reflecting on my time dancing during the service at Koinonia Baptist Church in Tamale, Ghana. There are pictures, there might even be some video.
</p>

 <p>
God of joy,
</p>

 <p>
Forgive me for the many times <br></br>
when what others were thinking <br></br>
was more important to me <br></br>
than expressing my praise to you.
</p>

 <p>
Remove any inhibition <br></br>
that stands in my way, <br></br>
and may my heart be <br></br>
so filled with joy <br></br>
that I cannot help <br></br>
but to dance <br></br>
before the throne of God.
</p>

 <p>
Amen
</p>
