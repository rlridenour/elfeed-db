As I listened to Mitch Randall’s sermon last Sunday at NorthHaven Church in Norman, Oklahoma, I couldn’t help but reflect on Paul’s words in Philippians 2. I hope the prayer for the week reflects that thought.
</p>

 <p>
Father,
</p>

 <p>
Protect us from the arrogance <br></br>
of unwarranted certainty, <br></br>
as it keeps us from hearing <br></br>
the voice of our neighbor.
</p>

 <p>
Cleanse us from the vanity <br></br>
of inflated self-importance, <br></br>
as it moves us to see only ourselves.
</p>

 <p>
May we never desire a freedom <br></br>
that forces others to worship as we do, <br></br>
for that is not the way of the one <br></br>
who took up, not his rights, <br></br>
but the cross.
</p>

 <p>
In his name, <br></br> <i>Amen</i>
</p>
