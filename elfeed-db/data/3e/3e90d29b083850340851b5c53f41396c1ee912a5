<h2 id="tangling-and-packages">Tangling and Packages</h2>
<p>In the last edition I had posted about a problem that I was facing. In short, when I deleted a package from my init file, the package was not deleted from the elpa directory where Emacs stores packages. I found that annoying. Having used <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs" target="_blank">Doom Emacs</a>, a long time ago, I seem to remember that I didn’t do much else but delete the reference to the package in package.el. That got rid of the package, or at least I think it did. In my plain vanilla-setup, that was not happening.</p>
<p>There are two steps to the solution: Firstly you have to remove the use-package command from init.el. Secondly, <code>M-x</code> and type the command <code>package-delete</code>, select the package that you don’t want to use anymore and delete it by hitting ↵ (return). One good thing about this list, packages are listed as obsolete, dependencies or installed.</p>
<p>This two step process works out fine.</p>
<h2 id="notes-and-note-taking">Notes and Note-taking</h2>
<p>My note-taking needs are simple. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to create and find notes quickly.</li>
<li>I would like to link between notes.</li>
<li>Tagging would be nice.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not looking for a graphical representation of my notes and the links between them. I don’t care to adhere to some knowledge management schema and its rules. In other words, I don’t care about atomic notes, fleeting notes, PARA, zettlekasten and all the other associated madness.</p>
<p>I don’t need denote, org-roam or howm. They are all great solutions. Not for me. Basic org-mode is all I need to create and access my notes. There are two things I added:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An automatic Unique ID for all newly created org-files. I will talk about this in the next section.</li>
<li>I brought back <a href="https://github.com/mclear-tools/consult-notes" target="_blank">consult-notes</a>. It is a nice interface to search for notes and gives me a preview of the note when selected. I like that.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="unique-id">Unique ID</h2>
<p>I wanted an unique ID added to any org file I created. With help from <a href="https://claude.ai/new" target="_blank">Claude</a>, I got this code for the unique ID:</p>
<pre><code>#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; First ensure org-id is loaded
(require 'org-id)

;; Configure org-id to create IDs using timestamps by default
(setq org-id-method 'ts)

;; Function to automatically add ID to new org files
(defun my/org-add-file-id ()
  "Add an ID property to the file if it doesn't have one."
  (interactive)
  (when (and (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
             (not (org-id-get-create)))
    (org-id-get-create)
    (save-buffer)))

;; Add hook to run when creating new org files
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'my/org-add-file-id)

;; Optional: Also ensure IDs are created for all headings
(defun my/org-add-ids-to-all-headings ()
  "Add IDs to all headings in current file that don't have one."
  (interactive)
  (org-map-entries 'org-id-get-create))

;; Optional: Add this to org-mode-hook if you want IDs on all headings
;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'my/org-add-ids-to-all-headings)
#+end_src</code></pre>
<p>This works great for newly created org files. Doesn’t work well with the capture templates that I have set up.</p>
<pre><code>#+begin_src emacs-lisp
            ("b" "Bookmark" entry
           (file+headline "~/Dropbox/org/bookmark.org" "Bookmark")
            ,(concat "* %^{Title}\n"
                      ":CAPTURED: %U\n"
                      ":END:\n\n"
                      "%a\n%i%?")
           :empty-lines-after 1)
#+end_src</code></pre>
<p>The capture template bails with an error-message which points out that org-id-get-create expects a specified buffer. I am working on trying to fix that, in the meantime, org-id-create is a manual process.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-cursor">Multiple Cursor</h2>
<p>I had this installed for two weeks and never used it once. Deleted it.</p>
<h2 id="try-package">Try Package</h2>
<p>Included <a href="https://github.com/larstvei/Try/tree/8831ded1784df43a2bd56c25ad3d0650cdb9df1d" target="_blank">Try</a> in the configuration. Seems like a good way of trying out packages without fully committing to them.</p>
<h2 id="move-the-scroll-in-emacs-without-moving-the-position-cursor.">Move the Scroll in Emacs Without Moving the Position Cursor.</h2>
<p>Added <a href="https://github.com/tanrax/scroll-page-without-moving-point.el?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">Move the scroll in Emacs without moving the position cursor.</a> to the configuration.</p>
<pre><code>#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package scroll-page-without-moving-point
    :straight (:host github :repo "tanrax/scroll-page-without-moving-point.el" :files ("scroll-page-without-moving-point.el"))
    :ensure t)
(global-set-key "\C-n" 'scroll-page-without-moving-point-down)
(global-set-key "\C-p" 'scroll-page-without-moving-point-up)
#+end_src</code></pre>
<p>That is all I have for this week. You can see I am having fun.</p>
