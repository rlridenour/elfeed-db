Lord Jesus, <br></br> <br></br>
What kind of king are you? <br></br></p>

 <p>
The kingdoms of this earth <br></br>
Pride themselves on their power, <br></br>
Their majesty, <br></br>
Their influence, <br></br>
And their wealth. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Yet you say that your kingdom is like <br></br>
A small seed, <br></br>
Yeast, <br></br>
And a net. <br></br></p>

 <p>
May your kingdom fill our lives <br></br>
As the yeast permeates the dough. <br></br>
As we grow from this small seed <br></br>
May we provide shelter and shade to those in need, <br></br>
Yet remaining rooted in you, <br></br>
And drawing nourishment from your compassion. <br></br></p>

 <p>
And when the day comes, <br></br>
We pray that you will <br></br>
Catch us in your net of love, <br></br>
Drawing us to our eternal home <br></br>
In your arms. <br></br> <br></br> <i>Amen</i>
</p>
