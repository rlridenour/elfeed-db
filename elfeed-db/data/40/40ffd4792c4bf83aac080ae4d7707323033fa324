</p>

 <p>
Lord Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
Children take what is given them <br></br>
With joy and gratitude, <br></br>
Without pretense, <br></br>
Never second-guessing <br></br>
The motives of the giver.
</p>

 <p>
You told us that we must <br></br>
Receive the Kingdom as a little child, <br></br>
Yet our pride keeps us from accepting <br></br>
That which you offer by the hands of your servants. <br></br>
Teach us to receive the gifts of ministry <br></br>
That you so graciously provide.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
