God of love and grace,
</p>

 <p>
Before there was anything else, <br></br>
there was love, <br></br>
perfect and pure.
</p>

 <p>
It was a love so full <br></br>
that it manifested itself <br></br>
in the creation of the infinite universe <br></br>
in all of its beauty and diversity.
</p>

 <p>
We rejoice today with those <br></br>
who shed tears of joy <br></br>
when, against all odds, <br></br>
love won.
</p>

 <p>
Our joy, though, is not yet complete, <br></br>
as we grieve today with those <br></br>
who shed tears of sorrow <br></br>
when, as churches burned, <br></br>
hate seemed to overcome.
</p>

 <p>
But even now, as we stand <br></br>
between the forces of hate <br></br>
and the forces of love, <br></br>
we will not despair, <br></br>
for we know which side <br></br>
you are on. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
