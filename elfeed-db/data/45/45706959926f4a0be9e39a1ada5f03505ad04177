<p>Just making a note here. Following the release of <a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/mct">mct.el</a>, I <a href="https://github.com/karthink/elmo">packaged</a> some similar code I had lying around to use <a href="https://github.com/oantolin/embark#working-with-sets-of-possible-targets">Embark live collect buffers</a> as an incremental completion system for Emacs. That is, it does roughly the same thing as other completion systems: allow you to select candidates by typing in stuff at the minibuffer.</p>

<p><strong>Elmo is idiosyncratic.</strong> It does not show completions until you type some characters. It debounces completion candidate updates. It shows certain categories of completions in a grid. <code>RET</code> behaves like in Ido: it selects the top candidate or &ldquo;enters&rdquo; directories. On the flip side, the candidate buffer is a regular read-only buffer so you can use all your navigation commands. Regions, rectangles, registers, the whole lot. It&rsquo;s also (slightly) better integrated into Embark on the whole than the others, because it <em>is</em> some glue applied to Embark.</p>
<p><strong>Elmo is slow.</strong> Use Selectrum, or Vertico, or Ivy, or Icomplete instead.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> My primary reason for turning it into a minor-mode from a gaggle of hooks is that I can now turn it off.</p>
